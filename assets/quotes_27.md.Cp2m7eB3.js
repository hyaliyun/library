Hole is a brilliant and obsessively driven detective who uses unorthodox and sometimes illegal methods in his investigations. A recovering alcoholic prone to depression, the stress Hole's mental health suffers is often a focus of the stories. He has few friends and often clashes with colleagues. While later recognizing his problematic behavior and leaving the police force, he continues to find reason to aid with new criminal investigations even when it endangers him and loved ones. Harry's surname \\"Hole\\" translates to \\"Hill\\" in English and is the name of a historic Norwegian town (Hole, Norway) with a heritage that goes back to the Viking Age. The name is derived from Old Norse H√≥lar, the plural form of h√≥ll, meaning \\"round and isolated hill.\\" The word is pronounced as two syllables, with stress on the first (HOO-leh). In The Bat, the Australian police call him \\"Harry Holy.\\" Critics link the personality of Harry Hole to those of the famous literary detectives such as Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Jules Maigret, and Nero Wolfe. According to Jo Nesbo himself, the character is inspired by and a tribute to Michael Connelly's character Harry Bosch. Character Harry Hole is introduced in The Bat as a police officer with the Oslo Crime Squad. He was born in 1965 and has a younger sister S√∏s, who has Down syndrome and to whom Harry is deeply attached. His mother, a descendant of the Sami people, died due to cancer while he was in his twenties. Harry never had a close relationship with his father Olav, a former teacher. He has few close friends, one of whom is Bjarne M√∏ller, head of Hole's department. Other friends include Beate L√∏nn and Bj√∏rn Holm in the forensics division, a Bergen detective named Katrine Bratt who helps secure specialist information, and Gunnar Hagen, his former senior officer prior to Phantom. Taxi driver √òystein Eikeland is an old school friend of Harry's and one of the people he is closest to. Hole is a chain-smoker and heavy drinker who is introverted and subject to depression. He later stops drinking after realizing he is an alcoholic. His encounters with assassins, corruption, and serial killers throughout the novels often strengthen his cynical attitude. His problematic and often unsocial behavior, as well as his obsessive tendencies during investigations, brings him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues, many of whom dislike him while grudgingly respecting his work and abilities. M√∏ller often shields Hole from being fired, believing he is a brilliant detective and the Oslo Police Department needs him. Along with standard police training, Hole took specialized training in interrogation techniques and firearms at the FBI. Harry Hole's home address is in Sofies Gate in Bislett located in the author's own home city of Oslo. Many of the stories involve detailed background and descriptions of real locations such as the actual Oslo Police Department headquarters. Hole regularly interacts with city residents and immigrants from a variety of ethnic and social backgrounds. Many of the novels feature his favourite \\"watering hole,\\" Restaurant Schr√∏der (Schr√∏der's, for short) in St. Hanshaugen. Hole develops a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke, whose son, Oleg, sees Harry as a father figure and sometimes calls him \\"dad.\\" After the seventh novel The Snowman, their relationship suffers and a traumatized Harry leaves the police force. The next novel The Leopard shows Harry living in self-imposed exile in Hong Kong. Kaja Solness, a new Norwegian Crime Squad officer, asks him to return to Oslo to help investigate a possible serial killing. Learning his father Olav is also ill and likely soon to die, Hole returns to Oslo. During the story, Olav asks his son assist in his suicide in order to end his pain, but Harry cannot bring himself to do so. At the end of the book, Harry has a brief reunion with Rakel before then visiting the imprisoned killer of The Snowman. It is implied that Harry then aids in the criminal's own suicide. Disturbed by his recent experiences, Harry determines to return to Hong Kong for good. The next book Phantom depicts Harry returning to Oslo yet again some time later, this time because Rakel's son Oleg has been arrested for murder. Harry finds out the truth behind the murder, but is then shot and the book ends without clarifying if he will survive or not. Harry is revealed to be alive and living again in Oslo in the tenth novel Police. Deciding his obsessive pursuit of criminals has cost him too much, he now lectures at the Police College and resumes a relationship with Rakel. A series of killings lead his former colleagues to seek him out for help. Following these events, Harry marries Rakel and adopts Oleg as his son. He promises he is done with police work, but finds himself drawn into another investigation in the following novel The Thirst. Novels * In Flaggermusmannen (1997), translated as The Bat (2012).

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic version of the United States and centres around a racing car driver on his quest to obtain the Eight Great Cups of Ultimate, which are scattered throughout the country. The game was written by Chris Stamper and graphics were designed by Tim Stamper. Tranz Am was one of the very few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing instant loading of the game (the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes). The game received mostly positive reviews upon release: praise was given to the game's graphics and simple controls, while criticism was directed at its confusing interface. Gameplay A still image of gameplay. The interface to the left displays a map of the contiguous United States, petrol gauge, speedometer and lives The game is set in a post- apocalyptic United States in the year 3472. Eight Great Cups of Ultimate are dispersed around America, and the player's mission is to obtain all of them. Petrol is in short supply and the only way to re-fuel vehicles is to find petrol pumps, scattered across the country. The game is presented in a top- down perspective and involves driving around America to collect the eight trophies whilst avoiding natural hazards and kamikaze cars, which attempt to crash into the player. The player has a limited supply of petrol and must collect fuel at regular intervals by driving over petrol pumps. Obstacles include trees, boulders and destroyed buildings. The overworld has an invisible border which causes the player's car to reverse automatically to ensure that they do not cross the game's boundaries. The interface displays a list of comprehensive data: a map showing a list of key cities in the contiguous United States, petrol gauge, speedometer, remaining lives and engine temperature. Every key city in the game contains at least one petrol station. If the player drives too fast for too long, their car will overheat and slow down. To save an overheating car the player must drive below a certain speed or stop entirely to allow the engine to cool. Development Tranz Am is one of the few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing \\"instantaneous\\" loading of the game when the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes. The game uses the common technique of placing planar sprites with image sprites atop another, which often creates graphical errors and overlapped colours on the console. The game can also run on the 16K version of the Spectrum. Reception The game received a mostly positive reception upon release. Computer and Video Games praised the game's controls and accessibility, stating that they were \\"easy to get into\\" upon the first try. A reviewer writing for Home Computing Weekly found the game to be \\"compulsive\\" overall, but noted that the game did not live up to the promises made by the description on the packaging. Simon Lane of Popular Computing Weekly praised the game's graphics, sound and presentation, stating that they were of \\"a very high quality\\" and that Tranz Am was an \\"original game\\" in comparison with the other games released by Ultimate. Lane criticised the game's interface, however, stating that he found it difficult to \\"concentrate on everything all at once\\". Lane also added that the game did not reward the player enough for collecting all of the cups, displaying just a short congratulation message before inviting him or her to begin again. A reviewer writing for Your Computer magazine heralded the game as a program of \\"outstanding achievement\\", considering that the game's playing area was calculated at \\"600 times more than the actual screen area\\".

It usually begins during the last three months of pregnancy or shortly after childbirth. Symptoms may include feeling tired, retaining fluid, headache, nausea, upper right abdominal pain, blurry vision, nosebleeds, and seizures. Complications may include disseminated intravascular coagulation, placental abruption, and kidney failure. The cause is unknown. The condition occurs in association with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Other risk factors include previously having the syndrome, a mother older than 25 years, and being white. The underlying mechanism may involve abnormal placental development. Diagnosis is generally based on blood tests finding signs of red blood cell breakdown (lactate dehydrogenase greater than 600 U/l), an aspartate transaminase greater than 70 U/l, and platelets less than 100x109/l. If not all the criteria are present, the condition is incomplete. Treatment generally involves delivery of the baby as soon as possible. This is particularly true if the pregnancy is beyond 34 weeks of gestation. Medications may be used to decrease blood pressure and blood transfusions may be required. Corticosteroids may be used to speed development of the baby's lungs, if it is early in pregnancy. HELLP syndrome occurs in about 0.7% of pregnancies and affects about 15% of women with eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia. Death of the mother is uncommon (< 1%). Outcomes in the babies are generally related to how premature they are at birth. The syndrome was first named in 1982 by American gynaecologist Louis Weinstein. Signs and symptoms The first signs of HELLP usually start appearing midway through the third trimester, though the signs can appear in earlier and later stages. Symptoms vary in severity and between individuals and are commonly mistaken with normal pregnancy symptoms, especially if they are not severe. HELLP syndrome patients suffer from general discomfort followed by severe epigastric pain or right upper abdominal quadrant pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, backache, anaemia, and hypertension. Some patients may also suffer from a headache and visual issues. These symptoms may also become more severe at night. As the condition progresses and worsens, a spontaneous hematoma occurs following the rupture of the liver capsule, which occurs more frequently in the right lobe. The presence of any combinations of these symptoms, subcapsular liver hematoma in particular, warrants an immediate check-up due to the high morbidity and mortality rates of this condition. Risk factors Elevated body mass index and metabolic disorders, as well as antiphospholipid syndrome, significantly increase the risk of HELLP syndrome in all female patients. Females who have had or are related to a female with previous HELLP syndrome complications tend to be at a higher risk in all their subsequent pregnancies. The risk of HELLP syndrome is not conclusively associated with a specific genetic variation, but likely a combination of genetic variations, such as FAS gene, VEGF gene, glucocorticoid receptor gene and the tol-like receptor gene, increase the risk. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology is still unclear and an exact cause is yet to be found. However, it shares a common mechanism, which is endothelial cell injury, with other conditions, such as acute kidney injury and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Increasing the understanding of HELLP syndrome's pathophysiology will enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially in the early stages. This will lead to advancements in the prevention, management, and treatment of the condition, which will increase the likelihood of both maternal and fetal survival and recovery. =Inflammation and coagulation= As a result of endothelial cell injury, a cascade of pathological reactions manifests and become increasingly severe and even fatal as signs and symptoms progress. Following endothelial injury, vasospasms and platelet activation occur alongside the decreased release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor and increased the release of von Willebrand factor (vWF), leading to general activation of the coagulation cascade and inflammation. Placental components, such as inflammatory cytokines and syncytiotrophoblast particles interact with the maternal immune system and endothelial cells, further promoting coagulation and inflammation. These interactions also elevate leukocyte numbers and interleukin concentrations, as well as increase complement activity. =Low platelet count= vWF degradation in HELLP syndrome is inhibited due to decreased levels of degrading proteins, leading to an increased exposure of platelets to vWF. As a result, thrombotic microangiopathies develop and lead to thrombocytopenia. =Blood breakdown= As a result of the high number of angiopathies, the erythrocytes fragment as they pass through the blood vessels with damaged endothelium and large fibrin networks, leading to macroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. As a consequence of hemolysis, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and hemoglobin are released, with the latter binding to serum bilirubin or haptoglobin. =Liver= During the coagulation cascade, fibrin is deposited in the liver and leads to hepatic sinusoidal obstruction and vascular congestion, which increase intrahepatic pressure. Placenta-derived FasL (CD95L), which is toxic to human hepatocytes, leads to hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis by inducing the expression of TNFŒ± and results in the release of liver enzymes. Hepatic damages are worsened by the disrupted portal and total hepatic blood flow that result as a consequence of the microangiopathies. Collectively, widespread endothelial dysfunction and hepatocellular damage result in global hepatic dysfunction often leading to liver necrosis, haemorrhages, and capsular rupture. Diagnosis  Early and accurate diagnosis, which relies on laboratory tests and imaging exams, is essential for treatment and management and significantly reduces the morbidity rate. However, diagnosis of the syndrome is challenging, especially due to the variability in the signs and symptoms and the lack of consensus amongst healthcare professionals. Similarities to other conditions, as well as normal pregnancy features, commonly lead to misdiagnosed cases or more often, delayed diagnosis. There is a general consensus regarding the main three diagnostic criteria of HELLP syndrome, which include hepatic dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia in patients suspected to have preeclampsia. * A blood smear will often exhibit abnormalities, such as schistocytes, bur cells, and helmet cells, which indicate erythrocyte damage. * Thrombocytopenia, which is the earliest coagulopathy present in all HELLP syndrome patients, is indicated by low platelet count (below 100 x 109 L-1) or by testing the levels of fibrin metabolites and antithrombin III. * Elevated serum levels of certain proteins, in particular, LDH, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), are indicative of hepatic dysfunction. Extremely high serum levels of these proteins, specifically LDH levels > 1,400 IU/L, AST levels > 150 IU/L and ALT levels > 100 IU/L, significantly elevate the risk of maternal mortality. A number of other, but less conclusive, clinical diagnostic criteria are also used in diagnosis alongside the main clinical diagnostic criteria for HELLP syndrome. * De novo manifestation of hypertension with systolic pressure and diastolic pressure above 160mmHg and 110 mmHg, respectively. * Proteinuria, leucocytosis and elevated uric acid concentrations > 7.8 mg. * Decreased serum haptoglobin and haemoglobin levels. * Increased serum bilirubin levels and visual disturbances. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are instrumental in the correct diagnosis of HELLP syndrome in patients with suspected liver dysfunction. Unurgent cases must undergo MRI, but laboratory tests, such as glucose determination, are more encouraged in mild cases of HELLP syndrome. =Classification= A classification system, which was developed in Mississippi, measures the severity of the syndrome using the lowest observed platelet count in the patients alongside the appearance of the other two main clinical criteria. Class I is the most severe, with a relatively high risk of morbidity and mortality, compared to the other two classes. * Class I HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count below 50,000/¬µL. * Class II HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count of 50,000-100,000/¬µL. * Class III HELLP syndrome is characterised by a platelet count of 100,000-150,000/¬µL. Another classification system, introduced in Memphis, categorises HELLP syndrome based on its expression. * Partial expression of the condition is characterised by the manifestation of one or two of the main diagnostic criteria. * The complete expression of the condition is characterised by the manifestation of all three main diagnostic criteria. Treatment The only current recommended and most effective treatment is delivery of the baby, as the signs and symptoms diminish and gradually disappear following the delivery of the placenta. Prompt delivery is the only viable option in cases with multiorgan dysfunction or multiorgan failure, haemorrhage and considerable danger to the fetus. Certain medications are also used to target and alleviate specific symptoms. Corticosteroids are of unclear benefit, though there is tentative evidence that they can increase the mother's platelet count. Prognosis With treatment, maternal mortality is about 1 percent, although complications such as placental abruption, acute kidney injury, subcapsular liver hematoma, permanent liver damage, and retinal detachment occur in about 25% of women. Perinatal mortality (stillbirths plus death in infancy) is between 73 and 119 per 1000 babies of woman with HELLP, while up to 40% are small for gestational age. In general, however, factors such as gestational age are more important than the severity of HELLP in determining the outcome in the baby. Epidemiology HELLP syndrome affects 10-20% of pre-eclampsia patients and is a complication in 0.5-0.9% of all pregnancies. Caucasian women over 25 years of age comprise most of the diagnosed HELLP syndrome cases. In 70% of cases before childbirth, the condition manifests in the third trimester, but 10% and 20% of the cases exhibit symptoms before and after the third trimester, respectively. Postpartum occurrences are also observed in 30% of all HELLP syndrome cases. History HELLP syndrome was identified as a distinct clinical entity (as opposed to severe pre-eclampsia) by Dr. Louis Weinstein in 1982. In a 2005 article, Weinstein wrote that the unexplained postpartum death of a woman who had haemolysis, abnormal liver function, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia motivated him to review the medical literature and to compile information on similar women. He noted that cases with features of HELLP had been reported as early as 1954.

A large part of the book is laid at the time of the Second World War ‚Äì specifically, the Siege of Leningrad, wartime Vienna and the Bombing of Hamburg ‚Äì making The Redbreast a war novel as well as a crime novel. The book touches deeply on the still highly sensitive issue of Norwegian Collaboration with the Nazis and specifically the voluntary recruitment of Norwegians to the Waffen SS. The novel was voted Best Norwegian Crime Novel ever. Upon translation into English, by Don Bartlett, the novel was shortlisted for the Crime Writers' Association Duncan Lawrie International Dagger. Synopsis During the Siege of Leningrad of World War II, a small group of Norwegian Waffen-SS volunteers are manning trenches just a short distance from the western lines. One of their number, Daniel Gudeson, is shot through the head and killed when he stands up to celebrate midnight on New Year's Eve. His body and face are covered up and he is laid to wait for a burial committee the following day. That same night, another soldier named Sindre Fauke disappears, believed to have defected to the Russians. Oddly, later that night, Gudeson's body mysteriously reappears in the trench. After a hand grenade lands the soldiers in the hospital, one of them, under the guise of \\"Uriah\\", falls in love with a nurse. After an unsuccessful attempt to elope, the two are separated. Decades later, when the U.S. President visits Norway for an Israeli-Palestinian peace conference,Though negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians had started in Norway in 1993 - hence the name \\"Oslo Agreement\\" - by 1999 the Norwegians were sidelined. In actuality, the 2000 Camp David Summit, held on US soil with no Norwegian participation, had much the same diplomatic role as the fictional summit mentioned in Nesbo's book. Oslo policeman Harry Hole is assigned to the security detail. After shooting a suspected assassin during the approach of the President's convoy, Hole is promoted to inspector and investigates a crime involving a very expensive sniper rifle. In addition, a group of neo-Nazis with which Hole has a prior history is suspected in the murder of an elderly drunkard. Hole and his colleague, Ellen Gjelten, hear of a man connected to the arms dealings called 'The Prince' and set out to learn his identity. Hole shares a mutual attraction with a colleague named Rakel, who is reluctant to take things further with him due to a custody battle for her son, Oleg; unbeknownst to her and Hole, the matter is being orchestrated by Rakel's superior, who is also infatuated with her. Ellen accidentally discovers the identity of The Prince, but she is murdered by Sverre Olsen, one of the neo-Nazis, before she can identify him to Hole. When Hole and his new assistant, Halvorsen, attempt to arrest Olsen, they discover that another police inspector, Tom Waaler, has apparently shot him in self defence. When Rakel's superior and an elderly woman named Signe Juul are both murdered by the sniper rifle, Hole finds a link between the killings and Norwegian collaborators during the Nazi occupation. He also realizes that the killer has a split personality, with the second personality being that of Daniel Gudeson. Hole is led to believe that Juul's husband Even, who was obsessed with Gudeson, is behind the killings. However, Hole finds that Even has apparently committed suicide in an attempt to stop his \\"other personality\\" from continuing the murders. Hole realizes he is wrong when he comes across the actual killer's journal, in which he attacks the Norwegian Royal Family and other government officials who fled to England during the occupation, and who later labeled the collaborators as 'traitors' despite their resistance to the onslaught of the Soviet forces. The killer also reveals the details behind the mysterious reappearance of Gudeson's body in the trenches and the truth behind Fauke's supposed defection. Finally, the killer threatens to assassinate Norway's Crown Prince during the Constitution Day celebrations later in the day as retribution for the 'betrayal' of Norway's leadership during the war. Hole rushes to prevent the assassination, managing to stop the attempt at almost the last second in a hotel room. To keep the assassination attempt out of the press - and to prevent any problems for the assassin's surviving family (which includes those close to Hole) - Hole's success is covered up.

It was formed in 1901, due to the growth of the professional game which meant that amateur players could no longer easily find places in the main England national team. First match and unbeaten run Its first international match was against Germany on 21 September 1901, a 12-0 win at White Hart Lane, London, R. E. Foster scoring 6 (One source gives 7). The next match was away against France on 1 November 1906 and resulted in a 15‚Äì0 win for England, with Stanley Harris netting seven goals and Vivian Woodward four. The team played many internationals against the full representative sides of Europe, which were usually a mixture of amateur and professional players. The strength of the English amateur team meant they were still able to beat many of these sides and in fact they were unbeaten in 20 matches from 1906 to 1910. Whilst these England amateur matches are not considered full senior internationals by The Football Association, they are deemed to be by their opponents. As such, the England amateur side delivered both Germany's and Belgium's biggest defeat in 1909, beating them 9‚Äì0 and 11‚Äì2 respectively. England amateurs and Great Britain Olympics team There is a difference of opinion as to whether the England amateur team was effectively the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 1908 and 1912 Olympic football tournaments. The FA's website considers the gold medals in these tournaments a win for the England amateur side rather than a British team, whilst in Bryon Butler's book it is shown that the winners' certificate names England. Conversely, Mark Chapman's England's Amateurs site states that the 1908 and 1912 teams were Great Britain and points to the fact that photographic evidence shows the team playing with the Union flag on their shirts. It was the case that for the 1956 Olympic tournament the team played as Great Britain but the team was organised by the FA and consisted solely of Englishmen as the other home nations withdrew their support. Demise and successors The England amateur team was disbanded in 1974 when the Football Association abolished the distinction between amateurs and professionals, simply calling them \\"players\\". A semi-professional representative team, made up of players from the National League System, now plays in its place.

An English- translated version of the book named The Devil's Star was translated by Don Bartlett. The story moves between two parallel themes ‚Äì the appearance of a new serial killer terrorizing Oslo, and Harry Hole's ongoing feud with the corrupt and utterly ruthless fellow police officer Tom Waaler, which was already a major part of the plot of the two previous books, \\"The Redbreast\\" and \\"Nemesis\\". Eventually, the two issues converge ‚Äì enabling Harry to resolve both in the course of a single cataclysmic night. Plot introduction A young woman is murdered in her Oslo flat. One finger has been severed from her left hand, and behind her eyelid is secreted a tiny diamond in the shape of a five-pointed star ‚Äì a pentagram, the devil's star. Detective Harry Hole is assigned to the case with his long-time adversary Tom Waaler and initially wants no part in it. But Hole is already on notice to quit the force and is left with little alternative but to drag himself out of his alcoholic stupor and get to work. A wave of similar murders is on the horizon. An emerging pattern suggests that Oslo has a serial killer on its hands, and the five- pointed devil's star seems to be the key to solving the riddle. Synopsis Pursuing his suspicions during the Nemesis investigation, Inspector Harry Hole attempts to convince the Chief Inspector that his colleague, Tom Waaler, is a smuggling kingpin known as 'The Prince', who has been involved in smuggling weapons into Oslo as well as the murder of a number of witnesses, including Hole's former partner Ellen Gjelten. Due to a lack of evidence, Hole is refused and goes on an alcoholic binge. His superior reluctantly sends termination of employment papers to the Chief Inspector, but Hole gets a short reprieve as the Chief is on holiday for three weeks and thus cannot sign them. Meanwhile, a murder victim is discovered dead in her shower, shot in the head. Waaler is appointed to lead the investigation, but Hole and his former partner Beate L√∏nn are attached to Waaler's team. Hole, investigating the murder scene, discovers a small, red, five-pointed diamond under the eyelid of the victim and that a finger is missing from her left hand. Another murder is presumed when the director of a theatre production of My Fair Lady, reports that his wife has gone missing. Her finger is later sent to Kripos; it has a ring on it with a small, red five-pointed diamond. A few days later a third victim is found, this time in the female toilets at a law firm, also on the floor and a five-pointed red diamond on the body. Yet again a finger has been removed. Waaler ‚Äì who has heard about Hole's investigation of him ‚Äì offers to include Hole in his illegal dealings, dangling the large financial benefits of his criminal activities as an inducement. In return, Hole has to perform an initiation task. Hole is initially confused as to why Waaler is effectively admitting his guilt, but is reminded that, as an alcoholic, Hole's evidence would not be sufficient to convict him if he went to his superiors. Hole agrees to think about the offer. Meanwhile, a chance sighting of a pentagram brings Hole a flash of inspiration. The five-pointed diamonds found on the victims are in a similar shape ‚Äì known as a Devil's Star ‚Äì and provide a major clue as to the next possible murder locations, which are kept under surveillance: one is in a student residence hall and the other is a house on the outskirts of the city, owned by Olaug Sivertsen. While investigating this house, L√∏nn discovers that the likely murderer is Olaug's son, Sven. She informs Hole by phone as he and Waaler are checking out the other prospective crime scene. Hole gives this information to Waaler, who immediately leaves to assist L√∏nn. Hole, using recently installed CCTV cameras, notices another pentagram on a student's door. Eventually, the body of the victim is found at the residence hall, and is determined to actually be the first victim of the serial killer, murdered five days before the first discovered victim. Meanwhile, Waaler apprehends Sven, but his threats to shoot him ultimately lead L√∏nn to realise that he intended to murder Sven instead of arresting him, leading her to agree with Hole's suspicions. Hole is given his task by Waaler: to kill Sven in custody using a poison capsule, as Waaler's influence is such that he can guarantee that Hole will get away with the murder. Waaler's argument for Sven's murder is that he would get a lenient punishment from the Norwegian judicial system, and that death would be a worthy sentence for his crimes. Hole realizes however that Waaler's desire to kill Sven is born out of a desire to eliminate a potentially dangerous witness to his role in the smuggling ring, and to this end he convinces Sven that he should trust him and not Waaler. He then breaks Sven out of custody with the intention of bringing Waaler to justice. Hole is now a hunted man, his future in the police - and quite possibly his life - depend on his being able to prove Waaler's crimes. Sven is willing to testify against Waaler, but he is adamant of his innocence of the murders, and consequently his testimony is wholly dependent on Hole exonerating him. Hole is faced with the daunting task of discovering the true murderer in a single day. However, a clue is provided by a seemingly irrelevant photograph which Sven shows Hole, and this combined with a very minute but precise piece of forensic evidence points to a completely unexpected perpetrator. Leaving Sven chained up, Hole encounters his new suspect in the immediate aftermath of his committing yet another murder. Hole comes very near to being killed himself, but eventually the killer commits suicide. Just as Hole believes that he is in the clear, Waaler calls to inform him that he has kidnapped his surrogate son Oleg and demands that he trade Sven for the boy. Hole arranges a meeting at the residence hall. Using the CCTV cameras as a bargaining chip, Hole tries to convince Waaler that his position is hopeless. More and more outrageous stories are proposed by Waaler to explain how he intends to cover up what has happened, and when it becomes clear that Waaler will kill all three witnesses in the lift of the building, Hole enacts an escape plan and manages to overpower Waaler and rescue Sven and Oleg, with Waaler ultimately being killed in the ensuing scuffle. Having exposed Waaler and solved the case, Hole's termination of employment is rescinded and he returns to the force.

It is the sequel to Ludlum's bestseller The Bourne Identity (1980) and precedes Ludlum's final Bourne novel, The Bourne Ultimatum (1990). The Bourne Supremacy gave its name to the second Bourne film starring Matt Damon The Bourne Supremacy in 2004, which, however, has a completely different plot from the novel. Plot In the first book, The Bourne Identity, the title character suffers amnesia. Over the course of the book, he regains his memory with the help of a Canadian economist, Marie, and eventually finds that his real name was Webb. He had previously been an operative of the Central Intelligence Agency in an elite project in Southeast Asia and Vietnam codenamed Medusa. Following the American forces' withdrawal from Vietnam, he joined Project Treadstone 71, where he was used as bait for the infamous Venezuelan assassin Carlos the Jackal, and assumed the identity of a mock assassin, Jason Bourne. ‚ÄúBourne\\" took credit for various kills in China and the rest of Asia, acting as a rival to the Jackal, in order to draw him out of hiding. The story of The Bourne Supremacy is set during the British negotiated handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on the expiration of its ninety-nine-year lease on the New Territories. Bourne has recovered from most mental and all physical injuries and is teaching Asian studies at a university in Maine under his real name of David Webb, living happily on campus with Marie under supervision of psychiatrist, Morris Panov. Meanwhile, high-ranking U.S. officials Ambassador Raymond Havilland and Undersecretary Edward McAllister discuss an increasingly alarming situation in the People's Republic of China, where the popular Communist official Sheng Chou Yang is boosting his rise to power with assassinations perpetrated by someone impersonating Jason Bourne (‚Äúimpostor\\"). They fear that Sheng, a fanatical nationalist, might trigger a war, and therefore want him to be found and killed. Webb would be ideal for this, but they plan to involve him indirectly owing to his mistrust of the U.S. government and Webb's deep-seated emotional instability due to the loss of his first wife and children in Vietnam. A representative of the U.S. Government, Edward McAllister arrives and informs Webb of the assassin in Asia who is killing under the name of Jason Bourne, a name feared because of the accredited kills during his work with Treadstone 71. Webb is told he requires a more visible security force because someone wants him dead. Soon thereafter, Marie is abducted by unknown people. Webb returns to the house, finds clues to her abduction, and immediately phones government officials, threatening to leak information about Treadstone and Medusa in an attempt to get assistance. He finds out information has been manipulated in order to make him seem crazy and delusional, and that his only course of action is to follow the instructions left for him by the kidnappers. He turns to the only person he thinks will be able to help him, Alexander Conklin, even though Conklin tried to kill him once before. Conklin, now limping, is convinced there is government involvement but that they have lost control of the situation and the hired guns holding Marie are no longer in their control. Webb, who has transformed back into his hated persona of Jason Bourne, now has no choice but to go to Hong Kong and play out the scenario to get Marie back. In Hong Kong Bourne is led to a wealthy Tai-Pan who wants Webb to bring back the impostor Jason Bourne because the impostor killed his wife; the Taipan is actually a British intelligence officer named Lin Wenzu collaborating with the CIA to make Bourne find the impostor. Bourne agrees, saying that if his wife is not heard of the very moment he returns, he will kill his nabbed impostor without a second thought. Lin Wenzu is later fatally injured when he uncovers and kills traitors in his team passing information to Sheng. Marie, held captive in a British hospital, fakes illness and escapes, taking refuge with Catherine Staples, a former colleague now employed at the Canadian consulate in Hong Kong. The duo make runs and go incognito to avoid the CIA and to find Webb. Unfortunately Marie runs away from Staples thinking she has joined forces with her captors who want to take her back, and Staples gets killed by Sheng's men. Marie later contacts Conklin and Mo, who arrive in Hong Kong and confront Under-Secretary McAllister and Ambassador Havilland, the orchestrators of the plan to manipulate Webb. Mo and Conklin keep Marie safe and away. Webb, tracking the impostor Bourne on land, water and air, through Kowloon and Macau, encounters D' Anjou alias Echo, another former Medusa operative, who is also tracking down the impostor Bourne, whom he had personally trained to be like Bourne. They join forces and track the impostor to mainland China, where they realise that a trap was laid by Sheng who was anticipating them following the impostor, and Echo is unfortunately captured. But Webb tracks him to a bird sanctuary at night, where Sheng Chou Yang is seen holding an open air conference with his rebel supporters and captured 'traitors' to his cause, whom he is going to 'judge', including Echo and the impostor Bourne. Echo is executed but not before he manages to delay Sheng and buy enough time for Bourne to mount a surprise attack on everyone. Amidst explosions and gunfire and killings, Webb captures the impostor Bourne, hijacks an empty charter plane and brings him to Kowloon, but in attempting to swap the impostor for Marie, is misled by McAllister, as Marie is not with them as was agreed, and still hidden by Conklin. Thinking Marie has been killed, an angry Webb now attacks and bombs Havilland's \\"sterile house\\" estate called 'Victoria Peak', where the impostor Bourne gets killed and Webb nearly as well, saved only by the timely arrival of Marie, Mo and Conklin. The cat is now out of the bag. Webb and Marie learn he was selected because no one was more skilled and lethal, and Marie was abducted because Webb would have never agreed to the mission, had the CIA told him the truth. Since Webb has now seen what Sheng is capable of and since Echo died for his sake, he decides to go back into the fray and kill the zealot. McAllister accompanies Webb, and during their search for Sheng, McAllister explains that he should be the one to kill Sheng, and Sheng will only trust McAllister for agreeing to rendezvous, and this has been McAllister's plan from the start. They fool Sheng into meeting with them for destroying single copy confidential documents that can expose him, in return for money. The meeting between Sheng, Webb and McAllister takes place on the Chinese border with the assistance of Wong, a previous acquaintance of Bourne. During the meeting McAllister sees that Sheng has already grabbed the confidential documents from Victoria Peak, and he is shot by Sheng before he can shoot the latter. But on scene arrives the lethal Bourne who stabs Sheng dead. Webb, McAllister and Wong escape in Sheng's helicopter amidst gunfire. In the end, it is shown that Lin Wenzu and McAllister have survived, Havilland commends McAllister for his acts of bravado, saying he will be promoted, Mo and Conklin have left for the USA, and Webb and Marie have now flown to Hawaii to rest. Marie tells Webb that every one has a dark side which they must accept. Jason Bourne is David Webb's dark side, the one who returned to save Marie.

Relic Hunter In the TV series Relic Hunter, Sydney Fox is a Professor of Ancient Studies, at a generic North American university. She most often teaches courses on what appear to be archaeology and cultural anthropology, though she is also shown teaching history and architecture as required by the plot. She frequently misses her own classes to work as a \\"relic hunter\\" who is constantly on the hunt for ancient treasures and artefacts so that she can bring them to their university‚Äôs museum.Relic Hunter. Inspired by an Indiana Jones style of adventure, Sidney Fox is often found battling rival hunters for artefacts.Jiwani, Yasmin (2005) The Eurasian Female Hero[ine]: Sydney Fox as Relic Hunter. Journal of Popular Film & Television 32 (4): 182-191. Her supervisors only rarely complain, since Fox usually stores the relics she finds in the university museum for safekeeping. Fox herself regards it as her duty to keep relics from falling into the wrong hands, either because they should be enjoyed by all mankind or because they are too dangerous to fall into the wrong hands. Sydney's weapon of choice is a Persian hand-crossbow, which she usually uses to deal with traps, relying on hand-to-hand combat when actually fighting. The series has attached a number of stereotypes onto her role as an Archaeologist throughout the series. Producers of Relic Hunter have utilized sex appeal to enhance Sydney Fox's character. Fox enjoys the rush of a dangerous mission, as she is unafraid of anything and is a good example of a strong and brave woman. Throughout the television series Fox's clothing is often tight fitting and revealing which makes her easily identified as a feminine sex symbol. With the exotic styles and accessories, Fox portrays a picture of a glamorized archaeologist. This image may be misleading to the reality of the field, yet proves to be more appealing for viewers. In a few episodes, Sydney is actually shown conducting conventional excavations, though she abandons the digs in question once it becomes apparent that the answers she needs are in a nearby sacred cave or ruined temple. Fox has an on-screen connection with Nigel Bailey. This connection is apparent through the emotional and physical bond they share as they work closely together. The storyline romanticizes and draws on an exotic setting in some episodes. Fox finds herself aroused by her constant dangerous surroundings. Episode 1 (\\"Buddha's Bowl\\") shows us Sydney Fox in her primary setting as a college professor. In the classroom, Fox expresses her teachings and love for her studies through a series of inappropriate class lessons. An example of this is in the first episode where her seductive dance moves and sexual tendencies are used to educate the students on tribal rituals Fox's initial first impression on Nigel had certainly caught his attention. As she stripped out of her ritual clothing and back into her office attire, the newly introduced teaching assistant is shown admiring her body as he attempts to remain in conversation, despite his obvious sense of hesitation and mesmerisation. Popular culture and archaeology Archaeology as a field of study has often been incorrectly portrayed by popular culture and mass media. False stereotypes glamorise it with the use of violence and thrill.Holtorf, Cornelius (2005) From Stonehenge to Las Vegas: Archaeology as Popular Culture. p12 Relic Hunter is an example of how a profession can be altered to fit public interests.Holtorf, Cornelius, and Quentin Drew (2007) Archaeology Is a Brand! p29. Although Relic Hunter has faults in its portrayal of the profession, the overall concept of searching for relics and uncovering historical archives is relevant.Holtorf, Cornelius, and Quentin Drew (2007) Archaeology Is a Brand! p221 While Fox is portrayed as a young professional to the field, her sex appeal is used to intrigue viewers and place a different spin on a female archaeologist/professor. Like real archaeologists, Fox does not hunt relics for glory or monetary gain, but so that they can be studied and learned from. Setting The show takes place in a variety of different settings across the globe; therefore its archaeological appeal can be interesting for a wide range of viewers. As the episodes follow Fox on different \\"hunts\\", the theme of the adventurous archaeologist searching for treasures is rampant throughout the series. The three seasons of Relic Hunter were created to have a multitude of different settings. Themes such as violence and the notion of discovery are intertwined with a sense of romance between characters Fox and Bailey. The idea of danger constantly being within hands reach makes the series both exciting and enticing to watch. This is a popular trend in contemporary archaeology programs.

Prince's Bay is bordered to the north by Huguenot, to the south by the Raritan Bay, and to the west by Pleasant Plains. The neighborhood is represented in the New York State Senate by Andrew Lanza, in the New York State Assembly by Michael Reilly, and in the New York City Council by Joe Borelli. The neighborhood's name is often mispronounced as \\"Princess Bay\\" or \\"Prince Bay.\\" It is believed the town was originally called Princess Bay for reasons unknown. A 1776 map of Staten Island shows it as Princess Bay. The community's United States Post Office officially bears the name \\"Princes Bay Station\\" according to the USPS web site and directory. Prince's Bay's ZIP Code is 10309, which it shares with other South Shore neighborhoods including Charleston, Pleasant Plains and Richmond Valley. The western part of Prince's Bay is now commonly recognized as a separate neighborhood, known as Rossville. History Prince's Bay Welcome Sign Princess Bay Boatmens Association Development in the area accelerated when the southern terminus of the Staten Island Railway was moved from Eltingville to Tottenville in 1860. The Prince's Bay station crosses underneath Seguine Avenue, formerly known as Prince's Bay Road. Primarily a fishing village at first, its oysters were so famous that \\"Prince's Bay Oysters\\" could often be found on menus at prominent seafood restaurants in Manhattan, and even London. A large factory, operated by the S.S. White Dental Manufacturing Company, was once located along the shoreline at the foot of Seguine Avenue; at one point, the plant was the largest employer in all of Staten Island, but closed in 1972. In the late 1970s a small shopping center, known as the Prince's Bay Trade Mart, was opened in the former factory complex; but its remote location and inability to compete with the larger and already-established Staten Island Mall doomed the project to failure, and it closed a few years later. The vacant complex was burned and razed, and the site has been kept empty due to ground contamination. At the northeast corner of the neighborhood is Wolfe's Pond Park, a city park that was the scene of a gruesome homicide committed by Gus Farace (at the time a Prince's Bay resident) and three accomplices in 1979. Lemon Creek flows into the pond for which the park is named; the creek can then be traced westward into land where dairy and poultry farms flourished until the 1960s, eventually travelling by underground conduits to the Arthur Kill. Prince's Bay and other communities on Staten Island's South Shore were once popular locations for summer homes, most of which were owned by residents of other boroughs, particularly Manhattan; however, these declined when the surrounding waters became increasingly polluted during the middle third of the 20th Century. The neighborhood also featured several small hotels, the Christmas Tree Inn on Wilbur Street being perhaps the most prominent among them. One block west of the latter is the South Campus of Staten Island University Hospital, formerly known as Richmond Memorial Hospital, which has the distinction of being the southernmost acute-care facility in both New York City and New York State. In recent decades, the area's waterfront has been revitalized by the development of many upscale single-family homes, becoming one of the more affluent areas on Staten Island. Points of interest The Abraham Manee House is one of the oldest houses in the five boroughs of New York City. The beams in the oldest part of the house date to 1670, while that part of the building is dated to 1690. Although designated a New York City Landmark by the NYC Preservation Committee (currently marked as endangered by the LPC),\\"Endangered Buildings Initiative: Abraham Manee House/Manee-Seguine Homestead\\" it seems that the local landlord, Leo Tallo, wishes to demolish it to build more townhouses.\\"Staten Island landmark in sorry shape\\" The house is located at 509 Seguine Avenue. The Seguine Mansion is a historic house with an equestrian center with peacocks and horses. Some parts of the home date back to 1670 and have been deemed endangered by the New York City's Preservation Committee.\\"Princess Bay Town of the Week\\" Wolfe's Pond Park and Lemon Creek Park are located in Prince's Bay. These parks contain children's playgrounds, open fields for outdoor sports such as football, baseball and soccer. These parks also contain running trails and divided dog parks for big and little dogs. The House at 5910 Amboy Road was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Biography He was born at Ho≈ôinƒõves near Hradec Kr√°lov√© (K√∂niggr√§tz). He was sent in 1807 to school at Hradec Kr√°lov√©, to escape the conscription, then to the University of Prague, where he founded a society for the cultivation of the Czech language. At Vienna, where he afterwards studied law, he established a Czech periodical; and in 1813 he made the acquaintance of Josef Dobrovsk√Ω, an eminent philologist. On 16 September 1817 Hanka claimed that he had discovered some manuscripts of 13th- and 14th- century Bohemian poems in the church tower of the town of Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© nad Labem and later some more at Castle Gr√ºnberg (Zelen√° Hora) near Nepomuk. The Manuscripts of Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© and of Zelen√° Hora () were made public in 1818, with a German translation by Swoboda. The originals were presented by him to newly founded National Museum at Prague, of which he was appointed librarian in the same year. Great doubt, however, was felt as to their genuineness, and Dobrovsk√Ω, by pronouncing the latter manuscript (also known as The Judgment of Libu≈°e), to be an obvious fraud, confirmed the suspicion. Some years afterwards Dobrovsk√Ω saw fit to modify his decision, but modern Czech scholars regard the manuscript as a forgery. A translation into English, The Manuscript of the Queen's Court, was made by Albert Henry Wratislaw in 1852. In 1846 Hanka edited the Reims Gospel and made it available to the general public, for which he received the cross of the Order of St. Anna by the Tsar Nicholas I and a brilliant ring by Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I. In 1848 Hanka, who was an ardent pan-Slavist, took part at the Prague Slavic Congress, 1848 and other peaceful national demonstrations, being the founder of the political society ' (\\"Slavonic Linden\\"). He was elected to the Imperial Diet at Vienna, but declined to take his seat. In the winter of 1848 he became lecturer and in 1849 professor of Slavonic languages in the University of Prague. He died in Prague on 12 January 1861. Works His chief works and editions are the following: *Hankowy Pjsne (Prague, 1815), a volume of poems *Starobyla Skiadani (1817‚Äì1826), in 5 vols, a collection of old Bohemian poems, chiefly from unpublished manuscripts *A Short History of the Slavonic Peoples (1818) *A Bohemian Grammar (1822) *A Polish Grammar (1839) (these two grammars were composed on a plan suggested by Dobrovsk√Ω) *Igor (1821), an ancient Russian epic, with a translation into Bohemian *a part of the Gospels from the Reims manuscript in the Glagolitic alphabet (1846) *the old Bohemian Chronicles of Delimit (1848) *History of Charles IV, by Procop Luph (1848) *Evangelium Ostromis (1853) *Hanka also composed the song Moravo, Moravo!, sometimes used as a Moravian national anthem.

She is best known for being a member of the Magnificent Seven, which won the United States' first team gold medal in Olympic gymnastics. She is also the first Asian-American woman to win an Olympic medal in gymnastics. Early life Chow was born to Nelson and Susan Chow, who had immigrated to the United States from Shanghai and Hong Kong, respectively. Chow began gymnastics training in 1981 at the age of 3. Her mother wanted her to be a ballerina and tried enrolling her in ballet schools, none of which would take a child that young. She then signed Amy up for classes at West Valley Gymnastics School in Campbell, California, where she joined an accelerated program at the age of 5, training under Mark Young and Diane Amos. Her younger brother, Kevin, was also a gymnast.  Gymnastics career  = 1989‚Äì1993 = At 11 years old, Chow became the first gymnast at her school to reach the elite level. She began competing nationally in 1990. = 1994‚Äì1995 = Chow's first international competition was the 1994 World Championships in Dortmund, Germany. After a poor showing in preliminaries (she fell twice on vault and three times in a single balance beam routine), she performed well in the team finals, helping the United States clinch a silver medal. The following year, Chow was part of the gold medal-winning American team at the 1995 Pan American Games, where she also won a gold medal on vault, silver on the uneven bars and bronze in the all-around. She made the United States team for the 1995 World Championships, but had to withdraw because of a sprained ankle sustained just days before the competition. = 1996 = Chow is primarily known for her performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics, where she won a gold medal with the team and a silver on the uneven bars. At the Olympic Trials, she fell off the beam, scraping her face on the side of the apparatus, but got up and completed her routine despite obvious pain, and was named to the Olympic team along with Amanda Borden, Dominique Dawes, Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, Jaycie Phelps and Kerri Strug. The team would become known as the Magnificent Seven. In the team final at the Olympics, Chow competed on the uneven bars and vault. In the bars event final, she completed a very difficult routine with an almost flawless dismount and scored a 9.837. She edged out the more experienced Dawes to tie for silver with Bi Wenjing of China, although the commentators felt Chow should not have had to share the medal, as Bi made a visible mistake that the judges did not take into account. After the Olympics, Chow and her teammates performed in numerous exhibitions, including the John Hancock Tour. = 2000 = When Chow decided to return to gymnastics in hopes of competing at the 2000 Olympics, she contacted Mark Young and asked him to train her for it. He agreed, despite the fact that he was retired by then. Chow juggled a rigorous training regimen with medical research at Stanford University, where she was working toward her undergraduate degree in biology, but ultimately took time off school to train. Five of the seven members of the Magnificent Seven tried for a spot on the 2000 Olympic team: Chow, Dawes, Miller, Moceanu and Phelps. In the end, only Chow and Dawes made it, along with Jamie Dantzscher, Kristen Maloney, Elise Ray and Tasha Schwikert. Chow proved she was in top form by finishing second in the all-around at the Olympic Trials. She was also named by B√©la K√°rolyi as one of three leaders of the 2000 team, the other two being Ray and Dantzscher. The team finished fourth at the Olympics, and individually, Chow finished fourteenth in the all-around final. Ten years later, on April 28, 2010, Chow and her teammates were awarded the bronze medal when it was discovered that the original bronze medalists, the Chinese team, had falsified the age of team member Dong Fangxiao. Dong's results were nullified, and the Chinese team was stripped of the medal by the International Olympic Committee. Chow said that while the American team had been disappointed with its fourth-place finish in 2000, she nevertheless felt bad for the Chinese gymnasts because they had worked equally hard to medal. = Notable skills = Chow has two gymnastics skills named after her on the uneven bars: the \\"Chow/Khorkina\\" (stalder 1¬Ω pirouette) and the \\"Chow II\\" (stalder to Shaposhnikova). She was nicknamed \\"the Trickster\\" within the gymnastics community for her extreme difficulty on each apparatus and her ability to perform complicated skills with apparent ease. She was the first American woman to perform a double-twisting Yurchenko vault and a tucked double-double bars dismount in international competition. She also competed one of the most difficult balance beam routines ever performed. It included a standing piked full; back handspring, layout, back handspring, layout series; full-twisting swing down; and round-off, back handspring, triple full dismount. Chow's plaque at the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame  Other accomplishments  In 1994, Chow received an advanced level certificate of merit for piano. In high school, she was a competitive diver for Castilleja School, and continued with the sport at Stanford. She also competed in pole vaulting as an unattached athlete at \\"open\\" track and field events. Because she received monetary compensation following the 1996 Olympics, she was ineligible to be a collegiate athlete.  Post-Olympics  Chow attended Stanford University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in biology in 2002. She graduated from Stanford Medical School in 2007 and completed her residency in pediatrics at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.SUMC [Stanford University Medical Center] in the News , August 4, 2008 She is licensed as a physician and surgeon. , Medical Board of California, Physician License Lookup, retrieved 2015-03-27 She married Jason Ho, an orthopedic surgeon, on July 10, 2010, in Saratoga, California. After finishing her residency at Lucile Packard in June 2010, she set up private practice as a general pediatrician in Northern California, where she lives with her husband and two sons, Timmy and Matty.  Awards and recognition  Chow was inducted into the U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame twice: in 1998 as a member of the 1996 Olympic team, and again in 2005 as an individual. In 2004, she was inducted into the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame. In spring 2003, Chow received the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans. She was also a recipient of the Outstanding Overseas Chinese Award. In 2008, she was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in the team category, alongside the rest of the Magnificent Seven. The team received their award in Chicago with other Olympic greats.

Between 1924 and 1931 his Cox & Danks Shipbreaking Co. successfully raised 35 ships of the German Imperial Navy High Seas Fleet that had been scuttled at Gutter Sound, Scapa Flow, in 1919. A tough but caring employer, after a series of fatalities and accidents to his employees, Cox sold his marine salvaging business to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company in 1932. He remained a consultant to the British Admiralty throughout his remaining career, and retired in the early 1950s after selling his profitable scrap metal business to Metal Industries Group. Early life Blue plaque Born in 1883, the eleventh son of a Wolverhampton draper, Cox left school at thirteen but chose to study electrical engineering in his spare time, and through a succession of jobs, earned himself the post of Engineer at a Wolverhampton power station by the age of eighteen. Deciding that anyone who could put electricity into peoples homes would become rich, Cox was determined to be just that, and moved to the post of Assistant Engineer at Leamington, and from there to Ryde Corporation on the Isle of Wight. In doing so he learned the art of salesmanship, selling electrical power installation to the inhabitants of Ryde. Early career From Ryde he moved to Hamilton, Scotland at the age of twenty-three, a change of position that taught him the rudiments of management. Moving yet again, this time to Wishaw in Lanarkshire, he took what was to be his last salaried job, laying down plant and network as Chief Engineer, aged just twenty-four. It was here in 1907 that Cox married the daughter of Wishaw Councillor Miller, the owner of Overton Forge, a Lanarkshire steelworks, and joined the firm as a partner. Unable to leave his post at the power station, he carried out both jobs simultaneously. Cox and Danks In 1913 he set up the firm of Cox and Danks Ltd, with his wife's cousin Tommy Danks as a silent partner and financier. Cox's need for capital was met by Danks, who sought a way to increase his inheritance without personal involvement in business. The firm was well positioned to profit from large munitions manufacturing contracts during World War I. The end of hostilities opened new and lucrative opportunities in scrap and metal salvage, enabling Cox to open new business in Sheffield, and buy out his partner Danks' interests by 1920. In 1921 Cox had branched out into shipbreaking and opened a yard at Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, on the River Thames estuary. There the company broke up and sold off an assortment of World War I surplus vessels, including two British battleships and and some ex-German naval items including a large floating dock taken as reparation following the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet prior to the Armistice. Fatal accidents on the wreck of the White Star liner (stranded on the Cow and Calf rocks, adjacent to Roches Point, off Cobh, Ireland in 1929), took some of the drive out of Cox, for he respected his workers and treated them accordingly. In Cox's opinion money could always be replaced, but good men could not. Resultantly, during 1932 he sold the company's marine salvaging business to Alloa Shipbreaking, and retired himself from marine salvage. Cox remained a consultant to the British Admiralty on matters of deep water salvage, and undertook their side of the work in the raising in 1932 of the old battleship , contracted to the Alloa Shipbreaking, which the Admiralty had used as a target ship and sunk by mistake. Foreseeing the possibilities of another war in Europe in the late 1930s, Cox expanded the scrap metals business by opening yards in: Bedford; Birmingham; London (Brentford, Feltham and Park Royal); Manchester; and Neath (South Wales). During World War II he undertook research and development for classified materials for the Ministry of Supply. Cox's last salvage task was during WW2, raising of the ship Stella, which, having been bombed by the Luftwaffe, had then sunk in and thereby blocked the Manchester Ship Canal. Again, Cox and Danks flourished as the war ended, disposing of military surplus and salvage. In 1949, Cox sold the firm to Metal Industries Group, who by now owned Alloa Shipbreaking. Though the salvage side of the business never quite broke even, especially during the course of the salvage of the German fleet (he was ten thousand pounds out of pocket at the sale of his interests), the scrap metal side business offset the loss by turning considerable profit, ensuring that when he retired he and his family no longer needed to work. Cox & Danks Ltd did well during the post-Beeching Axe era in the early 1960s, tendering for contracts to scrap surplus railway locomotives, rolling stock and associated equipment for British Railways. The majority of the GWR King Class locomotives were withdrawn late in 1962, with ten allocated to Cox and Danks for disposal.Portraits of Kings; B Holden & K Leech, Moorland Publishing Co.Ltd 1979 On 1 April 1970 the company, by then part of the Metal Industries wing of Thorn Electrical Industries, became a subsidiary of the Six Hundred Metal Holdings group owned by George Cohen's \\"600\\" Group.\\"Metal pair-up by '600' and Thorn\\", Bids, Deals & Mergers, The Times, 14 April 1970 German High Seas Fleet Lacking work, by 1924 he turned his attention to the wreckage of the High Seas Fleet, scuttled at its moorings in the natural harbour of Scapa Flow in Orkney, off the North-east coast of Scotland in late June 1919. Though initially written off by the British Admiralty as unsalvageable, the recent rises in the price of scrap metal had changed the value of the wrecks to the extent that they would now be profitable to lift, based on Cox's estimates of the quantity of high quality Krupp steel armour alone, before taking into account non-ferrous salvage. Ignoring expert opinion, his initial investment was to buy from the Admiralty the rights to salvage two battlecruisers ‚Äì and ‚Äì and twenty six destroyers. The two heavy ships were both accessible from the surface; Seydlitz was often mistaken for a small island as her port flank stuck perhaps six metres out of the water, and Hindenburg was upright with her decks awash. Cox's idea was to raise the Hindenburg and use its twenty-six thousand ton hull as a floating platform from which to enable salvage of the other ships. This was ultimately to prove impractical, as several attempts to lift the Hindenburg ended in failure, due to the hulk's instability and the likelihood of its capsizing whilst being pumped out, as it was sitting on rock and not shingle as had been first supposed. He took his reparation ex-German floating dock, once used for U-Boat testing and sectioned it lengthwise to salvage the first of his destroyers, which was then cleaned and converted into a floating workshop. His team was composed of local labour supporting a core of hired divers and skilled salvage men from all over Scotland; after some practice they were raising a destroyer every four to six weeks, with the fastest lift being accomplished in just four days. Heartened by this, Cox bought the rights to the remainder of the sunken fleet, and proceeded to lift the battlecruiser which was upside down in shallow water with her keel at the surface at low tide. Adapting the advice of Italian salvage experts who had raised an upside down ship from the bottom of Taranto Harbour, Cox raised the ship inverted by filling it with air. It was then lightened and towed to Rosyth on the Firth of Forth for scrapping, Cox having sold the hulk to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company for its weight in scrap. This basic technique would be used repeatedly on many ships of the fleet. Divers would descend to each wreck and perform work such as closing and dogging bulkhead hatches and fastening timber backed plate-steel patches over holes.. Then air would be pumped in from air compressors at the surface. In some cases where the hulls themselves could not be made close enough to air- tight, pontoons were used, similarly being filled with air, and ballast was sunk alongside the sunken ships and then secured to them to counterbalance them for lifting. It was during this stage of the project that his venture suffered a severe blow; the price of scrap metal collapsed, finally stabilising at a quarter of its previous value. Whilst sufficient profit remained to ensure a chance of breaking even, the sunken fleet no longer represented the cash rich harvest that it once had. Indeed, the price of scrap remained depressed until 1937, well after Cox had effectively retired from salvage. A plain spoken and often blunt man, Cox was known for his explosive temper; he was respected by his workers as being brilliant, hard working and stubborn to the point of pig-headedness. He did not spare either his workers or himself during the eight years he remained at Scapa Flow. He kept his business afloat by common sense and good judgement, such as the salvage of coal from the wreck of the Seydlitz to provide fuel for his machinery during the General Strike of 1926. This was balanced by acts of ego, such as the re- sinking of the Seydlitz after it had been successfully lifted early, as he had arranged for the press to be present on the day that it had been scheduled to be raised. Considered a 'showman' by his contemporaries, Cox was happy to allow the recording of some of the works in progress at Lyness on the Island of Hoy by reporters and photographers, including film shot for newsreel. Some of these can still be found on YouTube; Cox is visible in most of them, an active figure, incongruously dressed in tweeds. By May 1932, Cox had raised the battlecruisers SMS Moltke, SMS Seydlitz, , and SMS Hindenburg; the battleships and , and the light cruiser . After personally witnessing fatal accidents on the wreck of the White Star liner , and additional accidents whilst raising the Von der Tann and fatalities on the Prinzregent Luitpold, during 1932 Cox sold the marine salvaging side of his business to Alloa Shipbreaking, and retired from marine salvage. The Prinzregent Luitpold was the last ship that he raised in Orkney, despite having bought the rights to salvage , sunk at Scapa in 20 fathoms. Cox remained a consultant to the British Admiralty on matters of deep water salvage, and undertook their side of the work in the raising in 1932 of the old battleship , contracted to the Alloa Shipbreaking, which the Admiralty had used as a target ship and sunk by mistake. Cox was frequently assumed to be a poor businessman who did not understand business efficiency, and admitted to being inexperienced in the difficulties of ship raising. But he also suffered from an astonishing amount of bad luck during his eight years at Scapa Flow. Accidents that were as much the fault of the elements as of human error had plagued the salvage. An imaginative man, he learned quickly, overcoming the frequently appalling weather to which the area is prone, which when coupled to the fact that no two lifts are ever the same may have dissuaded or broken a lesser man. The rise and fall of the price of scrap frequently ate up the best of his profits during the long salvage operation. The major slump in the price of scrap during 1924 was only really reversed by 1937, in time for his successors Alloa Shipbreaking to capitalise on their investment (the hull of the SMS Friedrich der Grosse alone was valued at ¬£130,000 following salvage that year). Despite all this, he was considered a fair, if firm, and above all popular employer. His yard at Lyness on the Orkney Island of Hoy employed 200 workers at the peak of his business, and he was noted for granting holidays with pay during times of financial hardship. Later life After selling his business, Cox spent the remainder of his days supporting charities, and giving lectures on deepwater salvage, including the High Seas Fleet. In failing health, Ernest Cox died in 1959 at the age of seventy-six.

He was also a major Broadway performer. Biography Blackmer was born and raised in Salisbury, North Carolina, the son of Clara Deroulhac (n√©e Alderman) and Walter Steele Blackmer. He started off in an insurance and financial business but gave up on it. While working as a builder's laborer on a new building, he saw a Pearl White serial being filmed and immediately decided to go into acting. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Blackmer went to New York, hoping to act on the stage. While in the city, he took jobs and extra work at various film studios at the then motion picture capital, Fort Lee, New Jersey, including a bit part in the highly popular serial The Perils of Pauline (1914), his film debut. He made his Broadway debut in 1917, but his career was interrupted by service in the U.S. military in World War I. After the war, he returned to the theatre. In 1919, Blackmer played a major role in the strike that led to the formation of Actors' Equity Association.In 1929 he returned to motion pictures and went on to be a major character actor in more than 120 films. He won the 1950 Tony Award for Best Actor (Drama) for his role in the Broadway play Come Back, Little Sheba, co-starring with Shirley Booth. In film, Blackmer is remembered for his more than a dozen portrayals of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and for his memorable role as Roman Castevet in the Academy Award-winning 1968 Roman Polanski film about urban New York witches, Rosemary's Baby, in which he played an overly solicitous neighbor. A humanitarian, Blackmer served as the national vice president of the United States Muscular Dystrophy Association. He also helped start up the North Carolina School of the Arts. In 1972, he was honored with the North Carolina Award in the Fine Arts category. It is the State of North Carolina's highest civilian award. On his death in 1973, Blackmer was interred in the Chestnut Hill Cemetery in his hometown of Salisbury, North Carolina. Personal life Blackmer was married to actress Lenore Ulric from 1928 to 1939. His second wife was Suzanne Kaaren to whom he was married from 1943 to his death in 1973. He and Kaaren had two sons. They lived in the family home in Salisbury, North Carolina. For his contributions to the film industry, Blackmer has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1625 Vine Street.

This allows distributed devices to be managed in a unified way using one management system. According to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the term 'network element' means a facility or equipment used in the provision of a telecommunications service. Such term also includes features, functions, and capabilities that are provided by means of such facility or equipment, including subscriber numbers, databases, signaling systems, and information sufficient for billing and collection or used in the transmission, routing, or other provision of a telecommunications service. Background With development of distributed networks, network management had become an annoyance for administration staff. It was hard to manage each device separately even if they were of the same vendor. Configuration overhead as well as misconfiguration possibility were quite high. A provisioning process for a basic service required complex configurations of numerous devices. It was also hard to store all network devices and connections in a plain list. Network structuring approach was a natural solution. Examples With structuring and grouping, it is very well seen that in any distributed network there are devices performing one complex function. At that, those devices can be placed in different location. A telephone exchange is the most typical example of such a distributed group of devices. It typically contains subscriber line units, line trunk units, switching matrix, CPU and remote hubs. A basic telephone service leans on all those units, so it is convenient for an engineer to manage a telephone exchange as one complex entity encompassing all those units inside. Another good example of a network element is a computer cluster. A cluster can occupy a lot of space and may not fit one datacenter. For enterprise solutions, it is common to locate cluster nodes in different locations, even in different regions (settlements). Maintenance In general, an NE can generate two types of maintenance information: :#Information related to the quality or health of the transmission signal, and :#Information related to its own internal hardware/software integrity. The functional components of surveillance are performance monitoring and alarm/status monitoring, also known as alarm surveillance. In the national and international standards area for telecommunications operations, performance monitoring and alarm surveillance are classified as subcategories of the more general system management functional categories of performance management and fault management, respectively. Maintenance consists of both preventive and corrective procedures that are designed to (a) prevent troubles and identify potential troubles before they affect service, and (b) detect a network failure that impacts performance and make the appropriate repairs. A typical seven-step maintenance process consists of: :#Trouble Detection ‚Äì Detect trouble by continuous monitoring, periodic tests, per-call or other pre-action tests, or other automatic processes. :#Trouble Notification ‚Äì Send notification of a specific event or condition to a local display or Operations System (OS). Trouble notifications include output messages and visual and audible alarms. :#Service Recovery ‚Äì Minimize the degradation of service by automatic or manual protection actions. :#Trouble Verification ‚Äì Determine whether the reported condition still exists. :#Trouble Isolation ‚Äì Isolate the trouble to its source, preferably to a single field-repairable element, e.g., circuit pack. :#Repair ‚Äì Fix or replace the faulty element. :#Repair Verification and Return to Service ‚Äì Verify that the trouble has been fixed and return the element to service. Telcordia GR-474 establishes trouble- detecting and reporting criteria for signal transmission failures and internal hardware or software anomalies. GR-474 provides proposed generic requirements that pertain to the Fault and Performance Management functions in transport and switching NEs used for alarm surveillance and control.GR-474, Network Maintenance: Alarm and Control for Network Elements, Issue 2 GR-474 complements recent criteria in industry standards such as ITU-T Recommendation M.3100, G.707, and G.709, and ANSI T1. State models A network element state model facilitates cross domain network management and promotes a multi- vendor environment. The standard definitions and mappings allow Operations Systems to gather state information from NEs and integrate it into a consistent representation of the status of the entire managed network and each of the services that it supports. Telcordia GR-1093 discusses the two primary state models in industry.GR-1093, Generic State Requirements for Network Elements (NEs), One is the Telcordia State Model, which consolidates the state models previously described in several Telcordia documents. By consolidating the models, changes and expansions to the models can be presented and can evolve in a coordinated fashion. Also, inconsistencies and redundancy may be averted. The other model is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) State Model, which is defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.731.ITU-T Recommendation X.731 The state of an entity represents the current condition of availability of the underlying resource or service in the NE from the point of view of management. In the context of the Telcordia State Model, the term \\"entity\\" represents an entry in a TL1 administrative view (i.e., represents the resource or service generally identified by the Access Identifier [AID] parameter). In the context of the ISO State Model, the term \\"entity\\" means \\"managed object\\". Different types of entities (such as hardware, transport facilities, and subscriber service) have a variety of state characteristics that express the availability of their underlying resources that are specific to each entity type. However, a state model is expected to be common to a large number of types of entities. It expresses key aspects of their availability at any given time. The purpose of the state model is to indicate the availability of an entity in providing its functions and, if an entity is not available, to indicate the cause of the unavailability and what kind of activity may be taken by the manager (e.g., the OS or the craft) to make the entity available. In a specific application, only a subset of the state model may be needed. The rationale of such restrictions is not described in GR-1093. The technology or application-specific requirements document should be consulted for this information. The standard definitions and mappings allow Operations Systems to gather state information from NEs and integrate it into a consistent representation of the status of the entire managed network and each of the services that it supports. To help ensure interoperability, particularly for an OS that interfaces with multiple NEs using one of the two state models, a mapping between the models may be needed. GR-1093 provides a mapping for the two models and also defines the extension to the OSI state/status attributes that is necessary to meet the telecommunications needs of the service providers. Telecommunications Management Network A concept of the network element as a distributed entity is widely used in TMN model which in turn is used as a standard for developing element management systems.

Biography Fallon's family moved to Canada when he was a child. At age 18, he was in St. Louis and joined the third expedition of John C. Fr√©mont to California. Early in 1846, Fallon stayed in Santa Cruz after Fr√©mont visited the area. In June 1846, he raised a group of 22 Santa Cruz-area volunteers to join Fremont, appointing himself captain. When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began in California with Commodore John D. Sloat's capture of Monterey on July 7, Fallon's force crossed the Santa Cruz Mountains to capture the El Pueblo de San Jos√© de Guadalupe (now the City of San Jos√©) without bloodshed, on July 11. On July 14, 1846 he received an American Flag from Sloat, which he raised over the juzgado of San Jose, the pueblo's administrative building. Fallon's volunteers then joined Fremont's California Battalion for the remainder of the war. After the war, Fallon returned briefly to San Jose, then back to Santa Cruz where he established a business as a saddler. At the beginning of the California Gold Rush in 1848, Fallon took a cargo of iron picks made in Santa Cruz to sell to the gold miners. With his share of the profits, he built a combination residence/workshop/hotel on the Mission plaza in Santa Cruz (where the mission chapel replica stands now). In 1849, he married Carmel (Carmelita) Castro Cota (1827‚Äì1923), daughter of local landowner Martina Cota Castro (1807‚Äì1890) and her first husband Corporal Simon Cota, owners of Rancho Soquel. Carmel inherited one-tenth of Rancho Soquel, 3400 acres of land.http://historysanjose.org/wp/plan-your-visit/peralta-fallon-historic- site/the-thomas-fallon-house/ In 1852, Fallon sold his plaza property to the County of Santa Cruz for use as a courthouse.Kimbro, Edna E. Construction Chronology of the Site of Holy Cross Church: Ex-Mission Santa Cruz became Holy Cross, Santa Cruz Public Library Local History Articles Shortly thereafter, Thomas and Carmel moved their family to Texas. Following the death of their children, they returned to San Jose. In San Jose, Fallon began buying land in the area and built the Fallon House (1855) in Downtown San Jose. The house is preserved as a museum, across from the Peralta Adobe. In 1856, Fallon was elected to the San Jose Common Council. In 1857, he was elected to the city's Board of Trustees (which had replaced the Common Council) for one year. He was a council-elected Mayor of San Jose in 1859, and served a single one-year term. According to one account, in 1876 (after 26 years of marriage) Carmel found Thomas and the family maid in a compromising position,A Battered Beauty, The Noe Review and filed for divorce. Carmel used the divorce settlement to build several hotels and other buildings, including the Carmel Fallon Building (1894) at 1800 Market Street in San Francisco, now part of the San Francisco LGBT Community Center. Thomas Fallon died in San Francisco in 1885. Legacy In the 1980s, San Jose Mayor Tom McEnery had the city commission a statue of Fallon raising the U.S. flag in San Jose at a cost of over $800,000. The statue was completed in 1988, and was scheduled to be located in the City Park Plaza (now known as Plaza de C√©sar Ch√°vez) near the site of the flag raising. However local groups, including Hispanic Americans, protested that Fallon represented American imperialism and repression of the Mexican population. The statue was stored until 2002, when it was finally displayed in Pellier Park northwest of the original proposed location, near Julian and St. James Streets.

It includes the PowerTalk mail engine, which is the primary client-side interface to the system, the PowerShare mail server for workgroup installations, and a number of additional technologies such as Open Directory, encryption, and digital signature support. AOCE and PowerTalk were heavily marketed between 1993 and 1996, but the hardware requirements meant that most users couldn't even install or use it. Developers were likewise stymied by the complex system, and since the installed base was so small their potential sales were even smaller. In 1996, Apple Computer quietly dropped its efforts to market AOCE, and the project quickly disappeared. History Development of AOCE started in 1989, largely the \\"pet project\\" of Apple Fellow Gursharan Sidhu, formerly engineering lead at Apple for LaserWriter, AppleShare, and related networking products. =Problems to solve= The project started by taking a \\"20,000 foot overview\\" of existing mail systems, and trying to find common concepts and problems. Their key conclusion was that email systems were designed for the wrong purpose‚Äîto deliver email to people, when they should instead store and forward things to places. Compare this with the real-world postal service, which delivers not only mail, but magazines, packages, large parcels, and even (in one example) building materials to a worksite. The team also found other problems with existing email systems. They tended to support plain text mail only, and rarely supported non-English characters. Support for mobile users was poor, often relying on third party workarounds that were of dubious reliability. And they were all based on a dedicated e-mail server that was typically complex to set up, and often excessive for small installations with only a few people in an office. Finally, none of the existing products could give the user what they really wanted: a single universal mailbox and a single universal address book. In this pre-Internet era, savvy users often had mailboxes on their corporate network, online services such as CompuServe or AppleLink, and perhaps also a number of Bulletin board systems (BBSs). Each email system used its own standards for collecting and storing information, forcing users to run multiple clients to access the different services. Although a single-mailbox system could be constructed by administrators with the use of email gateways, these tended to be expensive and technically challenging to maintain. =Solutions= AOCE aimed to fix all of these issues at the same time. At one end of the system, AOCE focuses on the underlying delivery and addressing systems, generalizing the email concept so the system can be used to deliver anything from email to word processor documents to print jobs. Addressing was another issue the market was struggling with, so AOCE offers a single universal addressing mechanism and address book, one that could support not only people's email addresses, but the addresses of things like printers and fax machines as well. These could be looked up in an interface much easier to use than the existing Macintosh solution, the Chooser. AOCE normally store users' email on each personal computer, as opposed to a server. This not only allows the user to read mail offline, but also removes the need for a single machine with huge storage space. Small networks can be set up simply by installing the standard client software; the machines discover each other on AppleTalk and communicate directly. AOCE understands that users are not always connected to the network, so outbound mail is cached on the sender's machine until both the sender and recipient are online. Even on a LAN this is valuable, as many users turn off their computers at night and the mail would must wait until the next morning for delivery. Since the mail is stored locally, users with laptop computers are able to read and compose mail while mobile. Everything automatically updates upon reconnection to the office LAN. AppleTalk Remote Access, Apple's standard implementation of AppleTalk over modems, provides remote sync. For security over the potentially open phone lines, all communications can be secured using RSA encryption and digital signing, even on the local network. Additionally, the Keychain stores various login credentials in an encrypted file. This allows the users to use a different username and password on the various systems, placing them in the keychain database for secure storage. This requires only a single password for the keychain; AOCE can retrieve the credentials for a particular service on demand. Users can share documents directly simply by dropping the address on the document, or vice versa, bypassing a message at all - the document would arrive automatically in the other user's mailbox. Delivery of email (which in this scenario is nothing more than a text document in a specialized format), or of anything else, was handled entirely by plugins, allowing the user to collect mail from all of their sources into a single inbox. An optional server can be installed for performance and maintenance needs for those sites that required it. In this case any attempted delivery would be intercepted immediately by the server, thereby avoiding delays if the recipient was not online. The server then delivers the message on behalf of the sender when the recipient connects online. The AOCE project suffered from what is known as second-system effect, where engineers spend considerable time designing a system that does everything. Invariably these projects fail as the demands are not only incredibly difficult to meet, but often fail to meet real user needs. Often the ideas themselves are good, but buried inside unusable implementations. =Release= By early 1993 the client side of AOCE was nearing completion, which was then referred to as PowerTalk. Apple started a pre-release marketing campaign, telling larger customers and even third party email vendors that AOCE would soon arrive and change the market completely. Their claim was that nothing else would be able to compete with its usability, power, and lack of maintenance overhead - all hallmarks of the Apple way. The system was first widely shown at the Macworld Expo in Boston in mid-1993. At the show the developers found that the choice of naming was unwise, due to confusion between PowerTalk and Apple's new voice recognition system, PlainTalk. AOCE was publicly released in September 1993, part of the System 7 Pro bundle that also includes AppleScript utilities. =Deployment= When the product finally shipped after years of hype, users were dismayed to find that to install it requires a machine with 2.5 MB of RAM minimum, and needed 4 MB to run well. This is the maximum available RAM in many Mac systems of the era. Removing unneeded components do little to address this, and AOCE and the other Apple technology, QuickDraw GX, typically could not be run together because of a lack of memory. While newer machines were able to run AOCE more comfortably, as an email system intended to be run on diverse networks of non-homogeneous machines the requirements greatly impaired market acceptance. Simply downloading and installing separate stand-alone client applications for each mail system the user actually had would use considerably less disk space, and had no constant memory footprint. While PowerTalk was generally an interesting system, a combination of design features made it frustrating to use. For instance, the addressing system is so deeply embedded into the core of the system that simply typing in a new address is an ordeal. First the user clicks on a button, selects the address type, types it in, and then finally clicks \`OK\` to have it appear in the message. Disk usage is also a problem because each message is stored as a separate file, requiring 1 kB or more of space in an era where 40 MB and 80 MB disks are still common. Thus a few hundred messages are enough to fill the free space on the drive. Backing up email was likewise almost impossible as a side-effect of the design; the mail was spread out over the network, some of it remote and inaccessible. The system could not know who a user was, because the single-user Mac OS 7 does not require users to log in. Thus documents had to be delivered to a user's machine. This does not work well when the user has two or more machines, making the concept of a universal mailbox difficult to achieve in practice. Even the remote access functionality is doomed by feature interaction. To ensure that all messages are delivered in a reasonable time on a network where machines might appear and disappear at random (when they are turned on and off), AOCE has a 15-minute timeout in which it repeatedly tries to deliver pending messages. If the user is using a dialup connection on a modem, AOCE keeps the line open for a full 15 minutes before giving up on disconnected user, driving up long distance bills to deliver a potentially tiny message. Many of these problems were intended to be solved with the PowerShare server, which acts as an always-on, always responsive super-peer. The basic AOCE protocol notices these machines when attempting delivery, and sends to them first, thereby eliminating the delays and centralizing storage and maintenance. Sadly the server was not ready in time for the release, and did not ship for another year. When it did it was likewise slow and resource hungry, largely a side effect of various features of the Mac OS that makes it unsuitable for server applications--a role for which it was never designed in the first place. = Cancellation = AOCE had one year at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 1995 when it was finally selling, but by this point almost everyone realized that the market was moving towards SMTP-based internet mail as a universal format. By 1996 Apple had given up on AOCE, and started talking about the CyberDog project based on the OpenDoc platform. AOCE quietly disappeared and is not supported in Mac OS 7.6. Overview AOCE's Open Directory and related software introduced the concept of directory entries (such as business cards) as first-class desktop objects. This is used to create a drag-and-drop metaphor for mail, fax, and other directory-based activities. Each endpoint, a mail server for instance, is driven by a plug-in extension that is driven by a common AOCE-supplied queue and queue viewer. PowerTalk provides a set of standard forms for interacting with the items in the queues, and a common interface for mail, and a universal mailbox. Encryption is supported by a single keychain that remembered all your passwords and digital signatures, encrypting them together so only a single password needed to be remembered. The system was designed in an era when there were many email formats and services, including online services such as CompuServe and AppleLink, networking standards like X.400 and SMTP (Internet mail), and LAN-based servers such as Microsoft Mail and QuickMail. In order to support this diverse environment, AOCE includes a robust layered protocol stack that, in theory, can be used with practically any store-and-forward type of environment. This is used within AOCE not only to service mail, but faxes, printing and even directly sending files from one machine to another without enclosing them in a mail message or needing a file server. Adoption of AOCE among third party developers was slow due to a complicated API. The book documenting the system is larger than all of the books describing the rest of the pre-System 7 Macintosh combined. Adding a simple feature like \\"mail this document\\" to an application requires wading through hundreds of pages of documentation, and writing a core AOCE component is many times more complex. Several parts of the AOCE engine are useful on their own, such as the Keychain. However, in order to get the keychain, the user must install all of AOCE, a cost the users were not willing to pay. Many years later the keychain was finally shipped as a stand-alone component in Mac OS 9. The encryption and signing support is arguably also useful (although not widely deployed), and it reappeared in Apple's bundled Mail application starting with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar in August 2002. Reception In August 1994, Mel Beckman of MacWorld gave AOCE one star out of five, citing profoundly poor usability, documentation, hardware resource requirements, and telephone technical support. A network administrator of five years, Beckman failed to even properly send email after three dedicated days, saying \\"setting up and maintaining a PowerShare server is not a chore for the fainthearted\\" with daily tasks being \\"odious\\".

She was a Nantucket, Massachusetts native who later on in life immigrated to Arizona. A well travelled and educated woman, Summerhayes spent two years, from 1871 to 1873, studying literature in Germany. Her passion for writing took her into a career as a writer. She became well known as a writer in Massachusetts, but she usually did her writing during the winter, which, in turn, led to her becoming interested in the warmer weather of Arizona. In 1873, she married soldier John Wyer Summerhayes, a veteran of the American Civil War. Wyer Summerhayes was still in the military when the couple married, so Martha further expanded her travels by going with her husband wherever the military sent him when no war was being fought. The Summerhayes arrived at Fort Russell, near Cheyenne, Wyoming shortly after marrying. In 1874, they were sent by the military to an Arizona that at the time counted with only about 20,000 inhabitants. They stayed at a ranch owned by Corydon Cooley, a White man who had two Indian wives. Accommodations at Cooley's ranch were quite different from what Martha Summerhayes had experience in the east and Europe. She was also disturbed by the fact that Cooley had two wives. Her observations were published in 1908 in an autobiography named \\"Vanished Arizona\\" that details her memories of Arizona and the West before widespread settlement and the experiences of military wives. Summerhayes travelled, in August 1874, about 200 miles by a steamboat to Fort Mohave from Fort Yuma, enduring temperatures along the Colorado River that soared to 122 degrees. Soon after arriving at Fort Mohave, the military and their families loaded their belongings into wagons, heading to Prescott, near where Fort Whipple stood. For Martha Summerhayes, the experience of traveling through the desert was both adventurous and frightening; she was not used to using snake protection before sleep, witnessing dogs being eaten to their deaths by these animals, and other experiences. Soon after arriving at Prescott, the group of soldiers and their families moved slightly to the north, to Camp Verde. Martha Summerhayes by this point began to think that the military had better accommodations for prostitutes than they had for the soldiers' wives themselves. In Camp Verde, she befriended Mrs. George Brayton, who advised her to \\"Take all you need, and it will get carried along, somehow\\". The military group, consisting of 100 people, mostly men, faced a two-month-long trip to Camp Apache, passing by the Mogollon Rim. According to Summerhayes in her autobiography, they were attacked by Indians along the way. During that era, Apache Indians went twice a week to Camp Apache to be counted and receive food and water. At one point, she noticed that one Apache woman had a disfigured face and that she had lost her nose because she had supposedly committed adultery. Another time, she was watching a show, when the Apache chief \\"Diablo\\" supposedly approached major William Worth and asked him how many ponies would Worth accept in exchange for Worth's wife. Again, she attended an Apache show, and she feared for her life when the Indians, painted and wearing feathers, began to jump and shout around fires. She said that they had knives and recalled her fear. Eventually, she was able to leave the show. During her stay at Camp Apache, she found out that soldiers had also used cruelty in killing Apaches. Once handed a box, she noticed a foul smell coming from it. A soldier told her that the box had rotten cheese, and, in reality, it had the head of an Apache Indian, a fact which she found out about later, because she did not open the box herself. In January 1875, she was by herself as she gave birth to her son Harry. She had to perform various tasks by herself, because there were no nurses around, no running water for her or the newborn, barely any food (she and her baby survived the first days only on vegetables and milk), and, perhaps more importantly, no doctor to attend to them, as the military doctor on base was not well prepared to handle newborns and their mothers. In April 1875, despite the pleas of Mexicans not to try to travel to Phoenix because of hazards related to warring tribes, the Summerhayes made it to Arizona's future capital. Soon after, however, she and her husband, whom she affectionately nicknamed \\"Jack\\", moved back to Nantucket, thinking about baby Harry's welfare and about the hot Arizona summers. But they missed Arizona and returned shortly afterwards. In 1878, the Summerhayes moved to California. This was followed by various other moves which were appointed by the military. After Geronimo's campaign was over, the Summerhayes were ordered to Arizona once again. They arrived at Tucson using a Pullman car. In 1900, her husband retired from the military, and the Summerhayes returned to the East, where they lived in various cities including Washington, D.C., New York and Nantucket. After her 1908 autobiography was published, Martha Summerhayes became a celebrity, receiving fan mail from hundreds of people, especially military men and students that valued her view of military. Martha Summerhayes died on May 12, 1926 at Schenectady, New York. She and her husband John are buried next to each other, at the Arlington National Cemetery.

Life and work  Dobrovsk√Ω was born at Balassagyarmat, N√≥gr√°d County, in the Kingdom of Hungary, when his father Jakub Doubravsk√Ω (1701, Solnitz (Czech: Solnice), Bohemia 1764, Bischofteinitz (Czech: Hor≈°ovsk√Ω T√Ωn), Bohemia) was temporarily stationed as a soldier there. His mother was Magdalena Dobrovsk√° (1733, Tschaslawsko (Czech: ƒå√°slavsko), Bohemia 1797). He received his first education in the German school at Hor≈°ovsk√Ω T√Ωn in Plze≈à district, made his first acquaintance with the Czech language and soon made himself fluent in it at the Nƒõmeck√Ω Brod gymnasium, and then studied for some time under the Jesuits at Klatovy. In 1769 he began to study philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1772 he was admitted among the Jesuits at Brno and was preparing for a Christian mission in India. However, the entire order was dissolved in the Czech lands in 1773 and Dobrovsk√Ω thus returned to Prague to study theology. After holding for some time the office of tutor to Count Nostitz, he obtained an appointment first as vice-rector, and then as rector, in the general seminary at Hradisko (now part of Olomouc); but in 1790 he lost his post through the abolition of the seminaries throughout the Habsburg Empire, and returned as a guest to the house of the count. At this time, he wrote some of the most important works in Slavic studies, historiography and philology. In 1792 he was commissioned by the Bohemian Academy of Sciences to visit Stockholm, Turku, Saint Petersburg and Moscow in search of the manuscripts which had been scattered by the Thirty Years' War, and on his return he accompanied Count Nostitz to Switzerland and Italy. In the 1780s Dobrovsk√Ω participated in the academic life of Prague. In 1784, he helped to set up the Royal Czech Society of Sciences, and in 1818 the National Museum of what was to become Czechoslovakia and eventually the Czech Republic. However, his reason began to give way in 1795, and in 1801 he had to be confined in a lunatic asylum, but by 1803 he had completely recovered. The rest of his life was mainly spent either in Prague or at the country seats of his friends Counts Nostitz and Czernin, but his death occurred in Brno, where he had gone in 1828 to study in the local libraries. While his fame rests chiefly on his labours in Slavonic philology his botanical studies are not without value in the history of the science. Between 1948 and 1968 Czech poet Vladim√≠r Holan lived in the so-called \\"Dobrovsk√Ω House\\" on Kampa, often saying that the Blue Abb√© (a nickname by which Dobrovsk√Ω was known) would sometimes visit him.

Located at the foot of the Anaconda Range (known locally as the \\"Pintlers\\"), the Continental Divide passes within south of the community. As of the 2010 census the population of the consolidated city-county was 9,298, with a per capita personal income of $20,462 and a median household income of $34,716. It had earlier peaks of population in 1930 and 1980, based on the mining industry. As a consolidated city-county area, it ranks as the ninth most populous city in Montana, but as only a city is far smaller. Central Anaconda is above sea level, and is surrounded by the communities of Opportunity and West Valley. The county area is , characterized by densely timbered forestlands, lakes, mountains and recreation grounds. The county has common borders with Beaverhead, Butte- Silver Bow, Granite, Jefferson and Powell counties. History Anaconda was founded by Marcus Daly, one of the Copper Kings, who financed the construction of the Anaconda smelter on nearby Warm Springs Creek to process copper ore from the Butte mines. In June 1883, Daly filed for a town plat for \\"Copperopolis\\", but that name was already used by another mining town in Meagher County. Instead, Daly accepted the name \\"Anaconda\\", suggested by the United States postmaster of the time, Clinton Moore. Moore chose the name because of the important mine already existing in the area. When Montana was admitted as a state in 1889, Daly lobbied to have the capital moved here, but it stayed in Helena, a location supported by rival William Andrews Clark. In 1903, the Socialist Party of America won its first victory west of the Mississippi when Anaconda voters elected a socialist mayor, treasurer, police judge, and three councilmen. The Socialist Party had grown within the expanding Montana labor movement. Initially, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company tolerated socialist activities, but when the Socialists gained political power and threatened to implement reform, the company systematically undermined the radical party. City workers and councilmen refused to cooperate with the new mayor, and the company began to fire Socialists. In the long run labor lost ground in Anaconda and the company exerted ever greater political control.Jerry Calvert, \\"The Rise and Fall of Socialism in a Company Town, 1902‚Äì1905\\", Montana, Dec 1986, Vol. 36 Issue 4, pp 2-13 The Anaconda Company expanded smelting capacity over time; by 1919 the Washoe Reduction Works could boast that its 585-foot (178 m) smokestack (Anaconda Smelter Stack) was the tallest masonry structure in the world and that the smelter-refining complex constituted the world's largest non-ferrous processing plant. In 1980, Atlantic Richfield Company closed the smelter, bringing an end to almost a century of mineral processing.Aarstad, Rich, Ellie Arguimbau, Ellen Baumler, Charlene Porsild, and Brian Shovers. Montana Place Names from Alzada to Zortman . Montana Historical Society Press. While some aspects of the operation had been cleaned up under environmental laws, closing the smelter resulted in a large area contaminated with hazardous wastes. Since then, an operation for environmental cleanup was put into place by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and executed with the assistance of ARCO. The multimillion-dollar cleanup and redevelopment has resulted in the \\"Old Works\\" Golf Course, a championship 18-hole course designed by Jack Nicklaus.

Government and politics Deer Lodge County Courthouse in Anaconda Deer Lodge County voters have a record as the most consistently Democratic county in Montana for Presidential elections. These voters have not supported a Republican candidate since Calvin Coolidge in 1924. In the last five elections before 2016, the Democratic candidate has won by 21% to nearly 49% of Deer Lodge County's vote. In gubernatorial elections, the only Republican to carry the county in the last twenty years was Marc Racicot in the 1996 election.

It is owned by Harman International Industries, a subsidiary of South Korean company Samsung Electronics.  History  Mark Levinson Audio Systems Ltd. (MLAS) was founded 1972 in Woodbridge, CT (a suburb of New Haven) by Mark Levinson. Original MLAS products were designed by Mark Levinson with a team of associates. Audio pioneer Dick Burwen, Levinson‚Äôs first electronics mentor, helped Levinson start the company with the iconic LNP-2 Preamplifier. Chief engineer Tom Colangelo, who brought visionary audio circuitry to the company, died in a tragic car accident in 2007. In 1980, an investor acquired control of the company, allegedly without paying Levinson, and allegedly put MLAS through a planned bankruptcy to eliminate Levinson‚Äôs 43% interest in the company. Mark Levinson Audio Systems, Ltd. ceased to exist in 1984, with Madrigal Audio Labs acquiring its assets. Madrigal Audio Labs took Levinson to court and asked the United States government to forbid him from working in audio for the rest of his life. In August 1986, Levinson won the case but lost the right to use his given name as a trade name (such as is put on a product). Since 1990, the Mark Levinson brand and trade name have been property of Harman International Industries. Mark Levinson produces audio amplifiers and digital audio processors that have a characteristic black anodized chassis, a design associated with the brand since the beginning. Harman also makes Mark Levinson audio systems as an optional upgrade for Lexus luxury automobiles. Mark Levinson invented the concept of high-end car sound in 1979.

It is bordered to the east by the East Region, to the north by the Centre Region, to the northwest by the Littoral Region, to the west by the Gulf of Guinea (part of the Atlantic Ocean), and to the south by the countries of Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Congo. The South occupies 47,720 km2 of territory, making it the fourth largest region in the nation. The major ethnic groups are the various Beti-Pahuin peoples, such as the Ewondo, Fang, and Bulu. The South Region has a fair amount of industry, its main commerce consisting of logging, timber, mining, and offshore oil drilling. Commercial agriculture is also important in the South, the major cash crops being cocoa and rubber. Cattle rearing and fishing are significant economic components, as well. Much of the population is made up of subsistence farmers. 2008 presidential decree abolishes provinces In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing \\"Provinces\\" and replacing them with \\"Regions\\". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as Regions. This was to be the end of South. Geography =Land= The soil of the South is made up primarily of metamorphic rock, particularly gneiss. However, the land is riddled with faults around the border with the Centre Province that arc toward the border with Congo; granite deposits occur along this line. The soil is primarily ferrallitic except for southwestern portions near the border with Equatorial Guinea and moving north to Ebolowa, where it is mixed. Due to high amounts of leaching, the South's red earth is only marginally productive. =Drainage= Several river systems drain the South Region. The northernmost of these is the Nyong, which forms part of the border with the Littoral. The coastal Ocean division is drained by two rivers, the Lokounje to the north and the Lob√© to the south. The Ntem, or Campo, rises in the east of the region and flows along or just north of the southern border to the town of Campo. All of these rivers empty into the Atlantic Ocean. The Dja and Lobo Rivers flow through the easternmost division of the region, splitting south of Bengbis and encompassing the Dja Reserve. These two rivers form part of the Congo River basin. =Relief= The South Region begins at sea level on the coast. The land slowly climbs throughout the Kribi-Douala basin, which averages 300‚Äì600 metres in altitude, until it reaches the South Cameroon Plateau with elevations of 500 to 1000 metres above sea level. Rocky promontories on the coast and rolling, tree-covered hills inland characterize the land. The Ntem Massif near Ebolowa is the province's highest point at 1400 metres. =Climate= The climate of the South Region is Type A or Guinea-type climate. Humidity is high, and precipitation averages 1500‚Äì2000 mm per year in the interior and 2000‚Äì3000 mm per year in the coastal region. The coast from the north of Kribi south to Ebodj√© gets as much as 4000 mm of rain per year. Temperatures are relatively high as well, averaging 24Àö C and 26Àö C from Kribi north along the coast. In lieu of traditional seasons, the Guinea-type climate affords alternating dry and wet periods. The year begins in a long dry season that lasts from December to May. This is followed by a light wet season from May to June and a short dry season from July to October. A heavy wet season begins around October and lasts through November. Orphaned chimpanzee near Djoum =Plant and animal life= The South is almost entirely covered in rain forest, the exception being a small tract of mangrove on the coast south of Campo. Much of this land has been intensely exploited for logging, however, allowing sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor and for thick undergrowth to flourish. Today, the only relatively untouched forest is located in a handful of nature reserves. The Dja Reserve (R√©serve du Biosph√®re du Dja) covers 5,260 km¬≤ in the northeastern portion of the province and the south- central portion of the neighbouring East. The Campo Reserve (R√©serve du Campo) covers 2,640 km¬≤ in the southwest on the border with Equatorial Guinea. Finally, the Mangame Gorilla Sanctuary (Sanctuaire √† Gorilles de Mangame) covers 1,224 km¬≤ on the Gabon border. In these more virgin areas, the forest is composed of multiple levels. Tall trees about 40 metres high make up the highest stratum. Below these lie smaller, thinner trees with leaves clustered at their tops. The forest bed has very little vegetation as little sunlight penetrates to it. The southern rain forest supports abundant wildlife, including some of Cameroon's last populations of chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants. All of these are becoming increasingly rare due to poaching and deforestation. More numerous are the various monkey, bat, and bird species. Other common animals include pangolins, porcupines and other rodents, and genets. Demographics =Settlement patterns= Over 324,000 Cameroonians live in the South Province, and the overall population density is about seven inhabitants per square km. The most populous area is the central region south of Cameroon's capital, Yaound√©, in the neighbouring Centre Province and extending south to Ebolowa, west to Kribi, and east to Sangm√©lima. The rest of the population lives in the villages and towns built around the roads that criss-cross the terrain. In contrast, the vast tracts of jungle that have little or no road access are scarcely populated. The forest area is also plagued by disease-carrying mosquitoes and blackflies that keep settlers away. Tradition settlements in the Centre are placed along roads, resulting in large numbers of houses near the road with forest beginning directly behind them. The traditional house is a rectangular structure made of mud bricks and thin, wooden or bamboo posts. Roofs were mostly thatched raffia palm in the past, but they are more often made of corrugated aluminium, iron, or tin today. Locations of South Province ethnic groups =People= The majority of the inhabitants of the South are members of various Bantu tribes that are collectively known as the Beti-Pahuin (B√©ti-Pahouin), the Fang-Beti, or simply the Fang. All of these groups speak various dialects of the Beti language. In addition, most inhabitants of the more populated areas can also speak French. Beti-Pahuin The Beti portion of the group is primarily situated in the Centre Province, but large numbers of Ewondo and Bane inhabit the Ntem and the Dja and Lobo divisions of the South. The Fang group lives close to the province's southern borders. The Fang proper are inland on the border with Equatorial Guinea and near Djoum. The Ntumu inhabit the area around Ambam, also on the southern border. The Mvang (or Mvae) occupy the regions directly east and west of the Ntumu. These tribal groups have many more members in Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Congo. The Bulu form the third group with about a third of the total Beti-Pahuin population. They are further broken down into the Bulu proper, who inhabit the rich cocoa producing area from Kribi to Ebolowa and east through Sangm√©lima and Djoum. Inland from Kribi live the Pahuin proper, centered on the villages of Bivouba and Fifinda. The Zaman occupy the valley of the Dja River. Other tribes Several non-Pahuin tribes also inhabit parts of the South. Several related peoples who speak Makaa‚ÄìNjem languages live inland a short ways. One of these is the Mabi, who live inland of this around Eboundja. The Ngumba (Numba) tribe inhabits portions of the interior around Band√©vouri to Lolodorf. The Mabea (Maboa), also have pockets or territory. Non-Makaa‚ÄìNjem-speaking groups include the Batanga, who occupy the coastal region from Kribi to Grand Batanga. The Bakolo (Bakolle) are a coastal people north of Kribi, and the Bakola live inland from the border with Equatorial Guinea to Ngumba territory. Most of these tribes have their own distinct languages. The South is also home to some of Cameroon's oldest continuous inhabitants, pygmies of the Baka (Babinga, Bibaya) and Beye'ele tribes. These hunter-gatherers roam the forests of the region, particularly the area at the center and southeast of the province from Ebolowa to Ambam and Djoum with the Lala on the coast near Lolodorf, Bipindi, and Kribi. These pygmy groups are becoming increasingly sedentary, however, taking up lifestyles very similar to their Beti-Pahuin and Makaa‚ÄìNjem-speaking neighbours and intermarrying with them. =Religion= Presbyterian and Roman Catholic missionaries converted most of the peoples of the region by 1939. Traditional beliefs are still strong, however, and large numbers of people still adhere to various animist beliefs, often in tandem with Christian beliefs. In some areas, such as the village of Mb√©le, animists still greatly outnumber Christians. Economy The South is one of Cameroon's most economically robust areas due to its numerous plantations and the tourism generated by its scenic beaches. The area's economic stronghold, however, is the port of Kribi, which services the Gulf of Guinea. Campo, near the border with Equatorial Guinea, is another important port. =Agriculture= Sustenance farming The majority of farming in the South Province is done on the sustenance level. Plantains are the major crop grown, with cocoyams being common north of Ebolowa. Maize, groundnuts, manioc, yams, beans, and other foodstuffs are raised in more modest quantities. Traditional farms are placed in forest plots that are cleared with basic tools such as axes, hoes, and machetes. This is done during the dry season, and the resulting brush is then burned, with care taken to preserve any fruit trees. Planting occurs at the start of the wet season. Vegetables and spices are grown close to the house, while tubers such as cassava, cocoyams, and yams are planted with plantains in larger fields further into the forest. Plots are fertilised with farmyard manure. Farmers harvest at the beginning of the next dry season. These slash and burn methods provide high yields the first year or two, but they eventually drain the soil of fertility. This necessitates the clearing of more farmland every few years, as this exhausted land can remain infertile for up to ten years. This presents little problem in the South's more underpopulated areas, but can pose difficulties in areas of higher population density. Plantation farming The South's equatorial climate makes it suitable for large plantations, as well. Cocoa is the major cash crop for the entire region, with 80% of the arable land of Dja and Lobo division and Ocean division dedicated to raising it. Major cocoa collection facilities are located in Ebolowa. Rubber is another important crop, and a major operation is located at Nj√©t√©, about 20 km inland from Kribi. Palm oil is harvested near Campo. Other food sources The South is also home to various animal husbandry operations. Poultry farms operate in the towns of Ebolowa and Sangm√©lima. Modest cattle rearing takes place inland from Kribi, as well, though the area's thick forests and the presence of the tsetse fly prevents larger-scale operations. Kribi is also the base for various commercial fishing interests that operate along the province's coast. Rural inhabitants of the South also practice hunting and gathering. Hunters traditionally utilise basic tools such as spears, bows and arrows, knives, and traps. In modern times, guns are increasingly used as well. This latter development has led to a great depopulation of many animal species, especially as demand has risen in urban centers such as Yaound√© for bush meat from the region. =Industry= With ocean access and vast tracts of forest, the South is home to a good deal of industry. Timber is a substantial part of the region's economy, and various logging companies have operations in the area. However, because the largest trees within the South itself have mostly been harvested, the region is increasingly being used as a transport network for logging vehicles from Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Congo on their way to the ports of Kribi and Douala. Kribi is also the site of sawmills, and a palm oil mill operates in Lob√©. Ebolowa was in past years an important ivory- working center, but government regulations and the scarcity of elephants in modern times have dampened this part of the economy. Much of the South's electricity is produced in hydroelectric power stations on the Ntem and Ma'an rivers. The South also has a fair amount of mineral wealth. Iron ore is mined near Campo and Kribi. Natural gas is found offshore of Campo, and a Kribi- based plant has been processing this since the 1980s. Perhaps the region's most lucrative resource is oil. This, too, is found off the coast of Campo. But more importantly, the South Province is located at the terminus of the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, which was completed in June 2004. The pipe's mouth is located just south of Kribi, a fact that promises to bring in high revenues for both Cameroon and the province. =Transportation= For a region so heavily forested, the South has a fairly developed transportation network. Four main roads service the greater area of the region. The first of these, National Road 2, runs from Yaound√© to Ambam and then to the border with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. National Road 7 is located completely in the South, travelling along the coast from Kribi to Campo. National Road 9 comes south from Yaound√© via Mbalmayo and then to Sangm√©lima, Djoum, and Mintom. Finally, National Road 17 begins at Sangm√©lima and goes to Megong before crossing the border to Gabon. Other major roads cover the stretches between Mbalmayo and Ebolowa and between Kribi and Ed√©a in the Littoral Province. Of these, the route from Ed√©a to Kribi and from Ebolowa and Sangm√©lima to Yaound√© are paved. All other roads in the province are dirt, and thus subject to weather conditions. The South is also accessible via sea and air. The major seaports are Kribi and Campo, though Kribi is busier. Kribi is also the site of the regional airport. There are also airstrips at Ambam, Campo, Ebolowa, and Sangm√©lima. =Tourism= The South sees a good number of tourists due largely to its long, white-sand beaches. These run along the entire coastline, though the easiest to reach are at Kribi and Lob√©. Kribi is the most popular destination due to its accessibility from Douala and Yaound√© via paved roads. It is also the largest beachfront town in the South, and it has an active nightlife and several large hotels. Undertow is a significant problem, however, and several bathers drown on Kribi's beaches each year, a fact the locals personify as the siren-like \\"Mami Water\\". The undertow at Campo is less dangerous, though the difficult road to reach that town keeps most holiday- seekers away. Lob√©, only a few kilometres south of Kribi, is another popular spot with tourists due to its even more isolated beaches and the picturesque Lob√© Falls (chutes de Lob√©), found where the Lob√© River empties into the Atlantic. Local artists and vendors frequent the area around the falls, as do drivers offering to take passengers to Kribi or 65 km further south to see the Lala Pygmy village Elogbatindi, . In addition, the Cameroonian government is working with various non-governmental organisations to develop ecotourism in the South. These efforts are largely concentrated on the area's two major parks, the Dja and Campo Reserves, both of which are bases for various gorilla habituation projects. The Netherlands Development Organisation runs another project that takes travellers to the Campo Reserve and then to traditional homes in Ebodj√©, a village 25 km north.

President Paul Biya, himself a Bulu from a village near Sangm√©lima, enjoys widespread support in the South due to its place as the heart of Bululand. However, Biya has often been accused of showing favouritism toward members of the Bulu and closely related Beti groups, and a disproportionate number of Bulu and Beti today work in the civil service, in government posts, or in state-owned businesses. On the other hand, Biya has repeatedly shown intolerance of any opposition from his Bulu-Beti base. In 1996, for example, South Region native and Biya aide Titus Edzoa announced his candidacy for the presidency and was arrested on embezzlement charges, apparently at Biya's urging. =Government= Divisions of South Region The capital of the region is Ebolowa, where the presidentially appointed governor has his offices. The region is further divided into four departments (d√©partements), also called divisions, each under the supervision of a presidentially appointed prefect (pr√©fet) or senior divisional officer. The Oc√©an department is the farthest west, located on the coast and administered from Kribi. Bordering this are the Vall√©e-du-Ntem (Ntem-Valley) department, governed from Ambam, and the Mvila department, headed from Ebolowa. Farthest east is the Dja-et-Lobo (Dja and Lobo) department, with Sangm√©lima its capital. The Beti-Pahuin and other ethnic groups in the South have little traditional political organisational structure. Instead, groups of families are loosely organised into clans under a single patriarch. During the French colonial period, the Bulu formed a tribal union of their various clans. Today, these elders hold little actual power, and most such positions are merely honorary. =Education= There are 972 schools in the territory. Most of these are located in the area's larger towns and villages. Attendance numbers diminish as one moves into the area's frontiers, particularly the vast, forested areas south of Ebolowa and Sangm√©lima. Here, students are expected to walk long distances to attend school each day, or else to stay with relatives or alone in towns where schools are located. This problem is not as pronounced at the level of primary school, as these tend to be more widely distributed even in the remoter areas. Nevertheless, all schools in the region tend to be overcrowded. =Health= Poor sanitation is perhaps the South Region's greatest health hazard. Many villages have no access to running water, and even areas that do have it must contend with outbreaks of amoebic dysentery, bacterial dysentery, brucellosis, giardia, hepatitis A, and schistosomiasis. In 2004, the relatively developed town of Kribi suffered a major cholera epidemic. As it is almost entirely forested, the South supports many disease- carrying organisms. Malaria-bearing mosquitoes are one such pest, and the disease is a major health hazard in the region. Other parasitic diseases found in the South include dengue fever, falariasis, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever. Hospitals and clinics are fairly widespread, but they are mostly located in larger towns and cities. Traditional medicine is thus still the major source of treatment for many of the South's citizens, particularly those in more remote locations. Witchcraft is still blamed for many maladies, including HIV and AIDS in many cases. History =Early population movements= Archaeological finds in the areas of Kribi and Lob√© attest to human presence in the territory of the South Province since prehistory. Of the area's current inhabitants, the earliest to arrive were the Pygmies, who moved in from further south and east in ancient times and lived for centuries as hunter-gatherers in the forests. The Batanga arrived and settled the coastal areas in the 18th century. The Beti-Pahuin Bantu groups entered the area in the 19th century from the northeast, south of the Sanaga River. They were under pressure from the migrating Vute, Mbum, Babouti, and Gbaya, who were themselves fleeing the Fulbe (Fula). The Beti-Pahuin were more militarily advanced than the natives they encountered, and they easily subdued and assimilated these peoples or else pushed them away, as with the Ngumba and Mabea, descendants of the Maka and Njem, who had traveled southwest toward the coast when the Beti-Pahuin had first encountered them a century earlier north of the Lom River. The Beti-Pahuin may have practiced cannibalism at this time, as well. Once across the Sanaga, in present-day East and Centre Provinces, the various tribal groups settled individually in family groups, or clans. The Ntumu, Fang, and Mvae moved toward the Dja valley and into present-day Gabon while the Bulu travelled west along the Nyong to their present territory. The Beti formed the final wave. =European contacts= Europeans knew the entire western coast of the present-day South Province since Portuguese ships first explored it in 1472. The Portuguese set up trade with the natives, collecting particularly pepper, ivory, kola nuts, and slaves. Other Europeans followed the Portuguese, and the Dutch became the most active by the 17th century. Minor trading centers emerged, including Kribi and Campo. Trade was carried out on the Europeans' ships, allowing the coastal tribes to set themselves up as go-betweens, finding slaves from the interior and distributing goods obtained from the Europeans. In fact, the Beti-Pahuin migration was still taking place during this time, allowing the Bulu to set themselves in such a position. The British supplanted the Dutch as the pre-eminent traders in the region by the 19th century. This was also the period of abolition, and the British sent elements of the Royal Navy in 1827 to the Cameroonian coast to prevent further slave trading. Merchants were instead encouraged to trade in items such as ivory, rubber, and palm kernels. Under the British, trade was conducted on land, and Europeans quickly set up bases along the coast. For example, a trading post was opened in Grand Batanga in 1828 to service the lower Cameroonian coastline. Slaves continued to be traded clandestinely. German-built building at Ambam, today used as a school =German administration= Germany annexed the Cameroons in 1884, and for the first few years, they were only interested in the coastal area. Explorers under Governor Julius Von Soden were the first to penetrate into the southern interior when they pushed in to Beti lands in 1887. Eugen Von Zimmerer followed as colonial governor with an aggressive push to build plantations, particularly to grow cocoa. Much of the road infrastructure of the province dates from Von Zimmerer's time, since the Germans needed a means of travelling along the coast and from plantation to plantation. It was largely the native population who was forced to build these improvements. As the Germans consolidated their power and conscripted workers, they faced resistance from the indigenous peoples. Of Cameroon's southern groups, the Bulu revolted first in 1891 in protest over their loss to the Germans of their lucrative trade position. Von Zimmerer's army finally suppressed the rebellion in 1895. That same year, the Ewondo rose up until the colonials were able to suppress them in 1896. Germany also replaced native chiefs with more sympathetic ones when they deemed it necessary. Jesko Von Pultkamer became governor of German Kamerun in 1895. He accelerated the creation of plantations through the southern forest zone, which created more need for conscripted native labourers. In 1907, the Ewondo rebelled once more, but the Germans again suppressed them. =French administration= In 1916, France gained control of most of Germany's Cameroonian territory at the end of World War I. Under French administration, the present South Province fell into the Kribi-Lolodorf-Campo district, governed from Kribi, and the Ebolowa-Akoafim district, governed from Ebolowa. The French maintained the various German-founded plantations and started new ones, including coffee plantations at Ebolowa, palm plantations at Kribi, and groundnut fields at Batoke. They also continued Germany's policy of propping up puppet chiefs of the various native peoples. The French greatly expanded the road network through the region and improved the port at Kribi, albeit still with native forced labour. =Post-independence= Upon Cameroon's independence in 1960, the present-day Centre and South Provinces were one territory called the Centre-South. In 1982, Paul Biya became the second president of Cameroon. One of his first moves was to separate the Centre-South into the modern Centre and South Provinces in August, 1983. Geology The West African coast has several structural basins, along with counterparts along the South American margin, which formed during the Late Jurassic to Albian-Cenomanian rifting associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland.Pauken, R.J., 1992, Sanaga Sud Field, Offshore Cameroon, West Africa, In Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1978-1988, AAPG Memoir 54, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, During rifting, fluvial and marine clastic rocks plus evaporites were deposited. The Sanaga Sud Field, located in the Douala Basin, was discovered with the Sanaga Sud A-1 well in 1979, and produces from Lower Cretaceous shales and sands overlain by Upper Cretaceous shales. The gas-water contact shows up as a seismic amplitude event. .

His ancestors had been members of the community of the Bohemian Brethren, and had clandestinely maintained their Protestant belief throughout the period of religious persecution, eventually giving their adherence to the Augsburg confession as approximate to their original faith. Palack√Ω's father was a schoolmaster and a man of some learning. The son was sent in 1812 to the Evangelic Lutheran Lyceum at then-Hungarian city of Bratislava, where he came in contact with the philologist Pavel J. ≈†afa≈ô√≠k and became a zealous student of Slavic languages (he mastered 11 languages and became familiar with a few others). Palack√Ω in 1821 in Vienna, painting by Franti≈°ek Tkadl√≠k After some years spent in private teaching, Palack√Ω settled in 1823 at Prague. Here he found a warm friend in Josef Dobrovsk√Ω, whose good relations with the Austrian authorities shielded him from the hostility shown by the government to students of Slav subjects. Dobrovsk√Ω introduced him to Count Sternberg and his brother Francis, both of whom took an enthusiastic interest in Bohemian history. Count Francis was the principal founder of the Society of the Bohemian Museum, devoted to the collection of documents bearing on Bohemian history, with the object of reawakening national sentiment by the study of the national records. =Joining of Czech national movement= Public interest in the movement was stimulated in 1825 by the new ƒåasopis ƒåesk√©ho musea (\\"Journal of the Bohemian Museum\\"), of which Palack√Ω was the first editor. The journal was at first published in Czech and German, and the Czech edition survived to become the most important literary organ of Bohemia. Palack√Ω had received a modest appointment as archivist to Count Sternberg and in 1829 the Bohemian estates sought to confer on him the title of historiographer of Bohemia, with a small salary, but it was ten years before the consent of the Viennese authorities was obtained. Laying down the foundation stone of National Theatre in Prague, May 16, 1868 Meanwhile, the estates, with the tardy assent of Vienna, had undertaken to pay the expenses of publishing Palack√Ω's capital work, Dƒõjiny n√°rodu ƒçesk√©ho v ƒåech√°ch a v Moravƒõ (\\"The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia\\"). This book, which comes down to the year 1526 and the extinction of Czech independence (Palack√Ω admitted that in writing about the national history since 1526, he \\"would have to lie\\"), was founded on laborious research in the local archives of Bohemia and in the libraries of the chief cities of Europe, and remains the standard authority. The first volume was printed in German in 1836, and subsequently translated into Czech. The publication of the work was hindered by the police-censorship, which was especially active in criticizing his account of the Hussite movement. Palack√Ω, though entirely national and Protestant in his sympathies, was careful to avoid an uncritical approbation of the Reformers' methods, but his statements were held by the authorities to be dangerous to the Catholic faith. He was compelled to cut out parts of his narrative and to accept as integral parts of his work passages interpolated by the censors. After the abolition of the police-censorship in 1848 he published a new edition, completed in 1876, restoring the original form of the work. The fairest and most considerable of Palack√Ω's antagonists in the controversy aroused by his narrative of the early reformation in Bohemia was Baron Helfert, who received a brief from Vienna to write his Huss und Hieronymus (1853) to counteract the impression made by Palack√Ω's History. Konstantin von H√∂fler, a German professor of history at Prague, edited the historical authorities for the period in a similar sense in his Geschichte der hussitischen Bewegung in Bohmen. Palack√Ω replied in his Geschichte des Hussitenthumes und Professor L√∂ffler (Prague, 1868) and Zur b√∂hmischen Geschichtschreibung (Prague, 1871). =Political activism= Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω (lithography, 1855) The Revolution of 1848 forced the historian into practical politics. In his famous Psan√≠ do Frankfurtu (\\"A Letter to Frankfurt\\") he refused to take part in the preliminary parliament consisting of 500 former deputies to the all-German Diet, which met at Frankfurt, on the grounds that as a Czech he had no interest in German affairs. In early June oversaw the Slavic Congress at Prague as its president. Later that year he was deputed to the Reichstag which sat at town of Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ (Kremsier) between October 1848 and March 1849. He was at this time in favour of a strong Austrian empire, which should consist of a federation of the southern German and the Slavonic states, allowing the retention of their individual rights. This movement was called Austroslavism. Its views met with some degree of consideration at Vienna, and Palack√Ω was even offered a portfolio in the Pillersdorf cabinet. The collapse of the federal idea and the definite triumph of the party of reaction in 1852 led to his retirement from politics. After the liberal concessions of 1860 and 1861, however, he became a life member of the Austrian senate. His views met with small support from the assembly, and with the exception of a short period after the decree of September 1871, by which the emperor raised hopes for Bohemian self-government, he ceased to appear in the senate from 1861 onwards. In the Bohemian Diet (zemsk√Ω snƒõm) he became the acknowledged leader of the nationalist-federal party (staroƒçe≈°i). He sought the establishment of a Czech kingdom that should include Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, and in his zeal for Czech autonomy he even entered into an alliance with the Conservative nobility and with the extreme Catholics. He attended the Panslavist congress in Moscow in 1867. He died in Prague on 26 May 1876. Legacy Portrait of Palack√Ω on a Czech koruna banknote Palack√Ω is considered as one of the three Fathers of the nation ‚Äì the first being the King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, the second is Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω and the third is President of Czechoslovakia Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk. Various individuals like to emphasize one over the other. As to historians, none have surpassed his history of Bohemia except when they have focused on a narrower time period.

It was adapted by Ingram from the 1908 novel The Magician by W. Somerset Maugham. It stars Alice Terry (the director's wife), Paul Wegener and Iv√°n Petrovich. Critic Carlos Clarens wrote that it was \\"perhaps the most elusive of lost films.\\"Carlos Clarens. Horror Movies: An Illustrated Survey. London: Secker and Warburg, 1968 (revised enlarged from the 1967 Putnam's edition published under the title An Illustrated History of the Horror Film), p. 72. However, since the time Clarens wrote this, various prints of the film have surfaced. Some have screened at independent movie festivals from 1993 onwards, and the film has also been shown on Turner Classic Movies. It remained commercially unavailable until being released on DVD in the Warner Brothers Archive Collection in 2011 (with a running time of 88 minutes).https://www.silentera.com/video/magicianHV.html Plot In the Latin Quarter of Paris, sculptor Margaret Dauncey is injured when the top of the huge statue of a faun she is working on breaks off and falls on her. After a successful surgery by Dr. Arthur Burdon saves her from paralysis, she and Burdon fall in love. The surgery is watched by various doctors and others including Oliver Haddo, a hypnotist, magician and student of medicine (a character in Maugham's original novel based on real-life occultist Aleister Crowley). Later, in the Library of the Arsenal, Haddo finds what he has been searching for - a magic formula for the creation of human life. One of the ingredients is the \\"heart blood of a Maiden\\". He rips out the page and presents the old book to Dr. Porhoet, Margaret's uncle and guardian, who has also been looking for it. When Margaret, Burdon and Dr. Porhoet go to the Fair at Leon de Belfort, they encounter Haddo, whom Margaret dislikes immediately. When Dr. Porhoet claims that the snake charmers use harmless snakes, Haddo refutes him and demonstrates his powers by letting a deadly horned viper bite him. He then magically makes the wound disappear. Porhoet remains unconvinced until the discarded viper strikes a young woman performer. Burdon has to rush her to a hospital. Later, Haddo visits Margaret uninvited. He hypnotizes her and tells her to concentrate on her statue. It seems to come to life to preside over an orgy. Critic Carlos Clarens calls this the high point of the film: \\"a nightmarish sequence in which the hypnotised heroine (Alice Terry) see herself in the midst of an orgiastic rite presided over by Pan himself, a prancing naked satyr played by Stowitts, the American dancer at the Folies Bergere.\\"Carlos Clarens. Horror Movies: An Illustrated Survey. London: Secker and Warburg, 1968 (revised enlarged from the 1967 Putnam's edition published under the title An Illustrated History of the Horror Film), p. 73. Two days before her wedding to Burdon, Margaret receives a note from Haddo, asking her to see him the next morning. She tries to resist the summons, but fails. On the day of the wedding, Burdon learns that Margaret has married Haddo instead but Porhoet is convinced it was against his niece's will and Burdon tries to track them down. Burdon eventually encounters the couple at a casino in Monte Carlo. He and Porhoet free Margaret while Haddo is away. Porhoet places her in a sanatorium to recover. However, Haddo finds her and takes her to his laboratory in a tower. Just as Haddo is about to stab a bound Margaret, Burdon bursts in. After a violent struggle, Haddo falls into a huge fire and is killed. Margaret emerges from her trance and is reunited with her true love. Porhoet finds the page with the formula and burns it and sets the laboratory on fire. Cast *Alice Terry as Margaret Dauncey *Paul Wegener as Oliver Haddo *Iv√°n Petrovich as Dr. Arthur Burdon *Firmin G√©mier as Dr. Porhoet *Gladys Hamer as Susie Boyd, Margaret's painter friend *Henry Wilson as Haddo's Servant *Hubert I. Stowitts as Dancing Faun (as Stowitts) A young Michael Powell made a brief appearance in a comedic role and also acted as assistant director. Production According to Carlos Clarens, \\"made for Metro in France, away from all interference, The Magician was saluted upon release by a barrage of negative criticism, mostly on grounds of tastelessness, that sealed the picture's doom. The still photographs, all that are available to the present day, show Ingram at the height of his pictorial talent.\\" However, it has been pointed out that \\"along with the Tod Browning- Lon Chaney collaborations, The Magician was one of the few serious American horror movies in a time of spoofs.\\"Phil Hardy (ed). The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror. London: Aurum Press, 1985; revised ed 1993, p. 36 Paul Wegener's Magician co-workers found him difficult to work with, who had his own make-up artist \\"whom he screamed at on the slightest provocation. Michael Powell was not impressed with Wegener's acting, saying his \\"one expression to indicate magical powers was to open his huge eyes even wider, until he looked about as frightened as a bullfrog.\\" Some film historians suspect Rex Ingram began losing interest in The Magician while filming the project and left sequences he did not find interesting to others to direct. This may account for why his credit on The Magician reads \\"Supervised by Rex Ingram.\\" Henry Lachman claimed to have directed the Sabbat sequence and Powell supports this account in his memoirs.  Reception  Lawrence Reid of Motion Picture News praised the film as \\"weird, fantastic, adequately suspensive, and shivery . . . no matter how it is accepted (there isn't so much of the box-office ring about it, after all) no one is going to dismiss it as something that doesn't belong . . . The film is splendidly atmospheric, contains some unique settings and is very well acted by a cast of international flavor.\\" Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times was impressed with the cast, writing that Alice Terry was \\"beautiful and phlegmatic,\\" Ivan Petrovich \\"emphatically sympathetic and capable,\\" and Paul Wegener \\"with good make-up\\" giving a \\"restrained performance.\\" Conversely, Variety's Fred was impressed with Wegener's performance yet more critical of the film, calling it \\"a very slow moving, draggy picture that has but a single thrill.\\" Similarly, the Cleveland Plain Dealer described the film as \\"A wild, improbable tale, not without its suspense and interest,\\" adding that \\"Ingram can never be stupid, but he is of late sometime careless.\\" Soundtracks Silent film composer Robert Israel created a score for the Turner Classic Movies reissue of the movie. The Ragged Ragtime Band created and performed a score for The Magician at the Brighton Fringe Festival in 2012. The Nenagh Silent Film Festival commissioned Eoin Mac Ionmhain to compose and premiere a live score for The Magician in 2013.

Turicum is the Latin name of Zurich. The first car made by Martin Fischer was a small single-seater go-kart like vehicle, 140 cm long, with pedal-operated steering and powered by a motorcycle engine. It had chain drive but a second prototype had friction drive. The friction drive consisted of a flat steel disc coupled to the engine which drove a small, leather-covered wheel running at right angles to its surface. The small wheel could be moved across the surface of the large disc, giving an infinitely variable gear ratio. They attracted little public interest. The Swiss industrialist Jakob Heusser was also involved to establish the car manufacturer. Production cars More conventional production cars, manufactured in Uster, with steering wheel and two-seater body were shown at the Paris Salon in 1906 and had a single-cylinder air-cooled engine of 785 cc capacity. A false radiator was fitted that acted as a fuel tank. The friction drive was retained and would be used on all the future cars. In 1907 the 10/12 hp model with four-cylinder engine of 1385 cc was introduced, and the single- cylinder model had its engine enlarged to 1045 cc. Two- and four-seat, open and closed bodies were offered. Martin Fisher left the company in September 1907. In 1912 a 16/26 model with 2613 cc engine was announced and this could be ordered with a conventional gearbox. Exports Sales in the home country were good, and cars were exported to Egypt, Italy, France, Germany, England, Denmark, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Turkey, Argentina and South Africa, but the company hit financial problems and stopped production end of 1912, but kept registered until 1925.

It is bordered to the north by the Adamawa Region, to the south by the South Region, to the east by the East Region, and to the West by the Littoral and West Regions. It is the second largest of Cameroon's regions in land area. Major ethnic groups include the Bassa, Ewondo, and Vute. Yaound√©, capital of Cameroon, is at the heart of the Centre, drawing people from the rest of the country to live and work there. The Centre's towns are also important industrial centres, especially for timber. Agriculture is another important economic factor, especially with regard to the province's most important cash crop, cocoa. Outside of the capital and the plantation zones, most inhabitants are sustenance farmers. 2008 presidential decree abolishes provinces In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing \\"Provinces\\" and replacing them with \\"Regions\\". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as Regions. Geography View of Yaound√©, the capital city of Cameroon =Land= The Centre's soil is primarily composed of Precambrian deposits of metamorphic rocks, such as gneiss, mica, migmatites, and schists. Granite dominates from about 4Àö N and to the Adamawa border. Faults along the border with the South Province have deposited metamorphic schists and quartzites, with some granite. Laterites are also common, caused by the decomposition of the crystalline rock. Red ferrallitic soil dominates most of the province, including the forested zone and much of the savanna area. Though as deep as ten metres, this soil is leached by silica and percolating water, making it only marginally productive for agriculture. However, it is usable as a building material, and traditional houses in the province are made from red, sun-dried bricks of mud. Toward the northern border, this soil becomes lightly evolved with large deposits of raw minerals, and at the confluence of the Sanaga and Mbam rivers, it is a mixture of several soil types. =Drainage= The Sanaga is the most important river in the province, as its many falls and rapids make it an important source of hydroelectric power. It also supports varied agriculture, as it is prone to flooding during the rainy season. It is navigable from Nachtigal Falls to Ed√©a in the Littoral Province. Several smaller tributaries that drain the Centre's Mbam division form the Sanaga. The Dj√©rem flows in from the Adamawa and then through the far northeast of the area before entering the East Province to join the Lom (the upper Sanaga). The Dj√©rem, like the Sanaga, is also subject to seasonal flooding. The Kim flows in from the Adamawa and through the northwestern portion of the Mbam division before merging with the Mbam River at the border with the West Province. The Mbam then empties into the Noun. The Noun, which flows in from the West Province, passes through the town of Bafia, and receives the flow of the Ndjim River north of Goura. The Noun then joins the Sanaga northeast of Monat√©l√©. The Nyong is the only major river in the province that does not flow into the Sanaga. It rises in the East Province, passes through Mbalmayo, continues west, then forms the border between the Littoral and South provinces. Because the Nyong flows completely through an equatorial climate, it has one period of high water during the rainy season (March to October), during which it is navigable from Mbalmayo to Abong-Mbang in the East Province. Other Centre Province rivers flow through both equatorial and tropical climate zones where rainy seasons occur at different times, and so they never experience great fluctuations in water level. All Centre Province rivers empty into the Atlantic Ocean via the Littoral and South. Most of the Centre's great demand for electricity is supplied from hydroelectric centres in neighbouring provinces. However, plans are in place for a dam on the Nyong at Njock-Mpoume and on the Sanaga at Nachtigal to better supply the region's power needs. Most lakes in the Centre are manmade and located in the Yaound√© area. The majority of these were created during the colonial period for the pursuit of water sports. =Relief= The Centre Province is entirely situated on the South Cameroon Plateau. The land varies from 500 to 1000 metres above sea level except for the valleys of the Sanaga and its tributaries, which dip as low as 200 metres. The land rises gently in escarpments from the southwestern coastal plain before joining the Adamawa Plateau via depressions and granite massifs. The terrain is characterised by rolling, forested hills, the tallest of which have bare, rocky tops. Deep valleys separate these. The province's highest point is Mbam Minkom, northwest of Yaound√©, at 1,295 metres. =Climate= The Centre falls completely within a Type A or Guinea-type climate. This gives the region high humidity and precipitation, with rainfall averaging 1,000‚Äì2,000 mm each year. Precipitation is highest in the southernmost portions and diminishes toward the north. Temperatures are fairly steady, averaging 24Àö for the entire region except for the northwestern portions of Mbam division, where they fall to 23Àö. The Centre also experiences equatorial seasons, alternating between rainy and dry periods. The long dry season begins the year, running from December to May. After this comes the short rainy season, which lasts from May to June. The short dry season comes next, from July to October. The year ends in the long rainy season from October to November. North of 5Àö, the dry periods last up to four months. =Plant and animal life= The Centre is forested except for the valleys of the Dj√©rem, Mbam, and Noun rivers (most of the Mbam division) and the northern border region. These areas are woodland savanna and Sudano-Guinea savanna, respectively. The woodland savanna is characterised by large expanses of grass punctuated by small copses of trees from the forested zones farther south. The Sudano-Guinea portion is similar, only the grass grows more thinly, and trees are both evergreen and deciduous. The region was once much more heavily forested, but exploitation of species such as ebony and iroko has thinned out the woodlands and allowed dense undergrowth to appear. This has also pushed the savanna farther south over time. Today there remains very little virgin land in the province. The Mfou Reserve (R√©serve du Mfou) is one such area, recently created by the WWF and the GTZ to protect various bird, monkey, and snake species. Cameroonian wildlife also lives in the Mvog Betsi Zoo in Yaound√©. In April 2019, 2 lions were discovered in Mpem and Djim National Park. Demographics =Settlement patterns= With a population of more than 3 million, the Centre is one of the more densely populated of Cameroon's provinces. The area has been an important population center for the Beti-Pahuin people for over a century, but it has since experienced a great amount of immigration due to the placement of Cameroon's seat of government there in colonial times. Yaound√©'s presence has prompted the construction of a large and well-maintained road system, and this has contributed to the area's boom. Another factor in the area's growth is its multiple plantations, particularly in the cocoa-growing centre between the Sanaga and Nyong rivers and the sugar-cane area of Mbandjock, which draw thousands of migrant workers, mostly from the highly populated West and Littoral Provinces. As an important educational and government centre, Yaound√© also draws many more highly educated migrants. The majority of the Centre's residents live in the city of Yaound√© (population 1.1 million) or along the roads and in the major towns. The population density thins out away from the major thoroughfares, especially in the Mbam and Upper Sanaga divisions. A few isolated settlements, such as Nanga Eboko, also support a larger population. Settlements in the Centre are traditionally placed along roads, resulting in large numbers of houses near the road with forest beginning directly behind them. The traditional house is a rectangular structure made of mud bricks and thin posts. Roofs are sometimes made of thatched raffia palm, but they are more often of corrugated aluminium, iron, or tin today. Territories of ethnic groups in the Centre Province =People= The Centre is one of the most important centres for the Bantu group known as the Beti-Pahuin (B√©ti-Pahouin), the \\"Fang-Beti,\\" or simply the \\"Fang\\". These peoples share a common language and have similar customs. The Beti-Pahuin are further broken down into the Beti, most of whom live in the Centre Province, and the Bulu and Fang, who primarily inhabit the South. Beti The Beti consist of several smaller groups. The Ewondo (or Yaound√©) occupy the Centre's most populated region, including Yaound√©, Mbalmayo, and the Nyong and So division. The Yezum and Yebekolo are Ewondo sub-groups. The Bane are more numerous in the South Province, but they have some members in the Nyong and So division. The Mbida- Mbane and Mvog-Nyenge live east of Yaound√©. The Eton-Beti, Eton-Beloua, and Beloua-Eton are headquartered in the Lekie division northeast of Yaound√©, including the towns of Saa and Obala. The territory of the Mvelle stretches east from Yaound√© along the Nyong valley to the northern portions of the Nyong and Mfoumou division, including the border town of Ayos and the plantation centre of Mbandjock. The Eki live throughout the Upper Sanaga division with settlements at Nanga Eboko and Minta. In addition, some peoples in the Centre are not truly Beti-Pahuin but are currently in the process of being assimilated by that group. Among these are the Manguissa, who live in a small territory in the Lekie division between the Sanaga River and the town of Sa'a, the Bamvele, Batchanga (Tsinga), Evuzok, Omvang, Yekaba, and Yetudi. Other tribes The area around the town of Bafia and the west-jutting finger of land on the border of the Littoral Province is the home of several related peoples, collectively referred to as the Banen or Bafia. Tribes in this group include the Ndiki, Ntundu, Lemande, and Yambetta. The Bape and Bekke are also a part, though they were assimilated only fairly recently. Though more numerous in the West and Northwest Provinces, several Tikar groups live in the Centre at northwestern border with the West Province and stretching north and east to the Njim River. Their main settlement in the province is Ngambe Tikar on the Kim River. The Centre's Tikar speak a language known as Tumu and its dialects. The Centre Province Tikar are further divided into the Bang-Heng, Bankim, Ditan, Ina, Ngambe, Ngume, Ue, and Yakong. Large numbers of Bassa live in the Nyong and Kelle division near the border with the Littoral Province. They are primarily situated in small villages of isolated huts. The Vute (Babuti) are a Bantu people who inhabit large swathes of the Mbam division to the east of Tikar and Bafia. Their domains are almost equal of those of the Beti in area. Tribes present in smaller numbers in the province include the Bajem, Baki, Bamun, Bulu, Fa' (Balong), Gbete (Kepere), Gunu, Lafa, Maka, Njauti, Nyokon, and Pori. Several heterogeneous groups collectively known as the Yambassa live in and around Bafia-Banen territory. Though most of these tribal groups have their own distinct languages, most people in the Centre also speak French. =Religion= European missionaries penetrated the territory under German and French colonial rule. Since, most of the region's inhabitants have converted to at least nominal Christianity. The most prevalent denominations are Presbyterianism and Roman Catholicism, though traditional animist beliefs are commonly practiced alongside Christianity, especially in more rural areas. Economy The Centre is one of Cameroon's strongest economic zones due in great part to the presence of the capital city. In fact, the area is second only to the coastal regions of the Littoral, South, and Southwest Provinces. Many international organisations are headquartered at Yaound√©, among them the Bank of Central African States and the African Organisation of Industrial Property. =Agriculture= Sustenance farming Woman selling bobolo (manioc) near Mbalmayo. Most farmers in the Centre are largely concerned with the raising of crops such as plantains (common south of Yaound√©) and cocoyams and yams (common west and northwest of the capital). Rice and yam cultivation are practiced along the banks of the Sanaga in the Upper Sanaga division. Groundnuts, maize and other cereals are common in the province's less humid north, and manioc grows throughout. Sustenance farmers first clear small patches of forest. They remove trees with traditional tools such as axes or machetes during the dry season and burn the resulting brush. Farmers take care to protect trees bearing edible fruit, such as mangoes, plums, and pears, though fires sometimes grow out of control and prevent this. Farmers then plant seeds after the first rains: spices and vegetables closer to the house, plantains and tubers in larger plots farther into the bush. Villagers traditionally group their farms together as protection against animals and harvest their crops at the beginning of the dry season. Such slash-and-burn agriculture is adequate for the needs of small villages away from larger urban centres. Soil is exhausted quickly, necessitating the change of fields every two or three years. The soil can remain infertile for as much as ten years. However, when settlements are sparse, this presents little problem. As one of Cameroon's most populous areas, however, soil exhaustion has become an increasingly troublesome problem for the Centre in recent years. To combat this, MIDEVIV, the Food Development Authority, sets up growing zones around major towns, especially Yaound√©, for the growing of bananas, cocoyams, plantains, and other necessities. Plantation agriculture This region is one of Cameroon's most important cash-crop zones due to its hot, humid climate and well- developed infrastructure. Cocoa is king, and it grows in all areas but the Mbam division. The largest plantations are those outside of Yaound√© and to a greater extent to the northwest between the Nyong and Sanaga Rivers. Other major cocoa centres include the Sanaga River valley near Nanga Eboko and the regions around the towns of Akonolinga, Obala, and Saa. Some of these plantations are owned by peasant populations of Bassa and Ewondo, and SODECAO (Cocoa Development Company) is a major owner. The Centre is also home to Cameroon's only sugar-cane plantations, located at Mbandjock. SOSUCAM (Soci√©t√© Sucrerie du Cameroun) is the largest company in the region with 40 km¬≤. Peasant sugar plantations also operate in the area. A variety of other crops make up the rest of the plantation economy. Rice cultivation occurs along the Sanaga River valley in fields owned by SARIOECOO. Coffee is another important crop, grown in the eastern forests. Tobacco plantations owned by the Cameroon Tobacco Company (CTC) lie north of the Sanaga River at Batchenga. Palm plantations for palm oil and kernels, are located in the lower Sanaga and Nyong valleys, in the Nyong and Kelle division. Most of these are owned by SOCAPALM, headquartered in Es√©ka. Pineapples are grown commercially at Mbandjock by the Cameroon Pineapple Company. Livestock Livestock raising is another important economic sector, and Yaound√© is a major market for cattle from other regions of the country. Cattle are raised on ranches owned by the Livestock Development Authority at Mbandjock, and poultry are raised in farms at Makak, Obala, and Yaound√© to supply the province's vast demand for eggs and chicken. Sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry are also raised more informally throughout the area. Hunting is practiced to some extent in more rural areas, but this has become increasingly rare as forest exploitation and firearms have depleted game species and their habitats. Bush meat from the East and South Provinces is today a lucrative trade in Yaound√© and the large towns. =Industry= U.S. Ambassador R. Niels Marquardt, Parker Transnational Industries Cameroon Chairman Dr. Ralph Thomson, and Governor Fai Yengo Francis in Yaound√© at the launch of Le Bus, a new public transportation system, on 25 September 2006 Because of its immense territory devoted to cultivation, the Centre also has a substantial food processing industry. For example, CAMSUCO (Cameroon Sugar Company) has a large processing plant in Nkoetang that supplies eighty percent of Cameroon's sugar. SOCACAO (the Cameroon Cocoa Company) makes cocoa butter in Yaound√©. The Brass√©ries du Cameroun also operates in Yaound√© producing beers and soft drinks. Other food-processing plants are located in Nanga Eboko (rice hulling) and Es√©ka. As it is the crossroads for logging vehicles travelling from the South and East Provinces, the Centre also has a sizeable timber processing industry. Major sawmills are located in Es√©ka, Mbalmayo, and Yaound√©. Other specialised plants do joinery work, veneer, furniture and construction. The booming immigration to Yaound√© city has nourished a strong building industry there. Brick making and construction of homes and offices have ballooned in recent years. Rocks from around the capital are quarried for building material. Artisans also form a significant slice of the economy. Those of Yaound√© have a co-op to help meet the needs of the tourist trade, while those of Nanga Eboko are renowned for their highly decorated pottery. Diverse industries round out the Centre's repertoire. One example is the Bastos Company, which produces cigarettes in Yaound√©. Textiles are another major industry, and cotton gins operate in Yaound√©. The capital is also a major fabric production centre. Rutile is mined at Akonolinga. =Transportation= The Centre is the crossroads of Cameroon, and as such, it is well equipped to handle the large amount of traffic that passes through. Most roads between towns and to neighbouring provinces are paved, and most of these lead to Yaound√©. The capital also serves as the transportation and shipping heart of the area, and to a smaller extent, Cameroon as a whole. National Road 1 heads from Yaound√© all the way to Kouss√©ri and Fotoko in the Far North Province. National Road 2 heads south from the capital to Ambam before continuing into Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. National Road 3, Cameroon's most heavily trafficked and thus most dangerous, covers the stretch between Yaound√© and Douala. National Road 4 travels northwest to Bafoussam in the West Province. National Road 9, one of the few that do not travel through the capital, begins at Mbalmayo and leads to the South Province towns of Sangm√©lima, Djoum, and Mintom. Finally, National Road 10 travels east from Yaound√© to Ayos and ultimately Bonis in the East Province. The Centre also forms an important hub of transportation by rail, air, and river. Train lines travel from Yaound√© to Douala and to Ngaound√©r√© in the north. An international airport is located just outside Yaound√© at Nsimalen, and airstrips are at Akonolinga, Bafia, Es√©ka, Mbandjock, and Nanga Eboko. The Nyong River is navigable from Mbalmayo northeast to Abong-Mbang in the East during the wet season. =Tourism= Many international visitors to Cameroon see at least the city of Yaound√©, if nowhere else. The majority of these travellers visit on company or government business, so the Centre sees little tourism per se. Yaound√© does offer many hotels, however, to handle the business and diplomatic traffic through the city. It is also the location of several manmade lakes used for sport and bathing. Most of Cameroon's monuments and museums are located in the capital. Several of the province's traditional chief's compounds are accessible to visitors. Among these is the compound of Matip Ma Ndombol of the Ndjogjel district of Es√©ka.

Biya enjoys a great deal of political support from the Centre's Beti majority, thanks in part to his policy of staffing the government and government-owned businesses with plenty of representatives of this ethnic group. Departments of Centre =Government= The province is divided into ten departments ('): # Leki√©, with its capital at Monat√©l√©, is northwest of Yaound√© # Haute-Sanaga (Upper Sanaga), with its capital Nanga Eboko, in the west and centre of the province # Mbam-et-Inoubou (Mbam and Inoubou), with its capital at Bafia, # Mbam-et-Kim (Mbam and Kim), with its capital at Ntui, is the largest, occupying almost the entire northern half of the province # M√©fou-et-Afamba (M√©fou and Afamba), with its capital at Mfou, is the area east and south of Yaound√©. # M√©fou-et-Akono (M√©fou and Akono), with its capital at Ngoumou. # Mfoundi consists entirely of the Yaound√© capital and greater area. # Nyong-et-K√©ll√© (Nyong and K√©ll√©), with its capital at Es√©ka, occupies the southwest corner of the province. # Nyong-et-Mfoumou (Nyong and Mfoumou) is opposite this at the southeast, governed from Akonolinga. # Nyong-et-So'o (Nyong and So'o), with Mbalmayo as its capital, is on the central border with the South Province. Each of these departments is headed by a presidentially appointed prefect ('), also called a senior divisional officer. The governor, also a presidential appointee, has his offices in Yaound√©. Traditional political organisation Several of the Centre's native peoples have at least some form of political organisation predating the colonial period. However, the province's majority, the various Beti peoples, has no strong traditions in this sector. Instead, a patriarch traditionally heads a clan of related families. These individuals can still be found today, though their positions are largely honorary. The Tikar, on the other hand, have strong political traditions. Each Tikar group is headed by a fon (foyn), who serves as the head of administration, religion, and ritualistic affairs. Below him are various nobles and lords who handle administrative tasks in smaller divisions of territory. Among the Banen, some sub-tribal groups are headed by a chief. Such individuals are rare, but they rule with absolute authority where they occur. Most Banen are merely loose connections of family groups, however. The Bafia and Yambassa have a similar structure with clans of family groups. The heads of the joint-families are the most important individuals in this traditional hierarchy. =Education= The Centre is the intellectual capital of Cameroon. The University of Yaound√© is the biggest and most important institution in the country, though smaller universities exist in the capital city and other towns. Yaound√© also tends to draw more educated migrants, as the jobs available there are often in government or for the various international organisations that have their headquarters there. Primary and secondary schools are also fairly widespread and easily accessible to most of the Centre's population. Primary schools are more widely distributed, even in many smaller villages. Secondary schools are less common, but due to the region's well-developed transportation network, students are able to travel to the larger towns where such schools are located relatively easily. This still requires them to stay with relatives or to lease rooms, however, and rent and school fees keep many students from pursuing higher levels of education. Due to the region's high population, many of these schools are critically understaffed and overcrowded. =Health= The Centre is serviced by a large number of hospitals and clinics, particularly in Yaound√© and in the larger towns. Traditional medicine is still common throughout, especially in the more rural areas. As with the rest of Cameroon, sanitation is the greatest health problem faced in the province. In rural areas, running water is not available, necessitating the drinking of water from contaminated rivers, streams, and swamps. The urban areas, particularly Yaound√©, present their own problems, as rates of population growth far outpace improvements in sanitation. As a result, outbreaks of illnesses such as amoebic dysentery, bacterial dysentery, and hepatitis A occur frequently. Large rainfall and inadequate drainage improvements also provide an ideal breeding ground for malaria-carrying mosquitoes in the capital. =Cultural life= Bafia dance The majority of Cameroon's museums are located in Yaound√©. The largest of these is the Cameroonian Art Museum (Mus√©e d'Art Camerounais), with its large collection of bas reliefs, bronze statuary, and traditional masks. This is also the only museum set up to handle both English- and French- speaking patrons. The Afhemi Museum is located in a private residence and showcases the owners own collection of Cameroonian art. The National Museum, located in the mansion once occupied by the French governor, offers cultural as well as artistic exhibits. The Centre is also the birthplace of bikutsi, a popular form of dance and music. The Ewondo people created the style, which today rivals makossa as Cameroon's most famous.  Traditionnal Dances  File:Prestation5.jpgBeti people File:GroupeDanse4.jpgBafia File:GroupeDanse.jpgBikutsi Common Food File:Mbongo tchobi et banae plantin malx√©.jpgMbongo Tchobi (Basa) File:Mintumba.jpgMintumba File:D√©gustation des b√¢tons de manioc.jpgBobolo History =Early population movements= Ancient tools found at Bafia, Efok, Okola, and Yaound√© attest to human presence in today's Centre Province since before recorded history. Of Cameroon's current inhabitants, the Baka pygmies probably roamed the area when it was more heavily wooded. In comparison, the modern inhabitants of the area are relative newcomers. According to one theory, much of the current Centre Province was once Bassa territory. The Bassa moved into the region from northeast of the Sanaga River before the 17th or 18th century. Another explanation of the Bassa's presence in the Centre says that they once lived further west, but they moved into the territory in the 18th century after ceding their coastal possessions to the Duala people. The Banen, Bafia, and Yambassa in the Babimbi region also moved to their present territories at this time, stopping their expansion upon reaching Bassaland to the southwest. The next wave of migration was in the 19th century and consisted of those peoples fleeing Fulbe (Fula) raids to the north, or else fleeing other tribes who were themselves being raided. It is possible that the Tikar of the province's northwest moved in at this time. The Vute entered the area from the southern Adamawa Plateau, having once inhabited the present territories of Banyo and Tibati. Vute tradition states that they moved south in three major groups, each under a different prince. The Vute were still in the process of migrating when the Germans finally stopped their progress. The Beti-Pahuin moved into the region at this time as well, travelling through in three separate waves from northeast, south of the Sanaga River. They were being pressured by the Gbaya, Mbum, and Vute farther north. As these people moved south, the Beti- Pahuin were forced to move further south, as well. The Beti-Pahuin conquered the peoples they encountered on this southward march, \\"Pahuinising\\" them in the process or pushing them away in their turn. A reputation for cannibalism may have aided them in their conquests. If the Bassa did indeed once inhabit territories further to the east, it was at this time that they were pressed toward the coast. These Beti-Pahuin groups moved southward to their present territories in small groups of families of clans. These first few waves, consisting of the Bulu and the Fang, continued into the present South Province and beyond, but the Beti, who moved south in the final wave, settled north of these relatives. The Bati-Tsinga were the original inhabitants of the current Banen-Bafia-Yambassa areas, but they were pushed away or assimilated when the Yambassa entered the region. The Yambassa came in search of farmland, moving in three major groups: the Behele, then the Elip, and finally the Kouono- Yambassa. They were pushed south in turn when the Banen-Bafia entered from the confluence of the Mbam and Noun rivers. They were then troubled by the Bamun to the northwest, and the Banen fought two wars with them beginning around 1840; they eventually pushed the Bamun across the Noun, though some Banen groups paid tribute to the Bamun until 1901. One tradition says that the Bafia also fought off the Fulbe. The other small tribes of the Bafia region came at later times. =European contacts= The movement of the Beti-Pahuin through the region coincided with the height of the European slave trade on Cameroon's coast. The Ewondo took the opportunity to establish themselves as middlemen in this trade, forming a link between the tribes further on the interior and those toward the sea. Their slaves were sent out via the Sanaga River in exchange for European goods. After Great Britain outlawed the slave trade in 1827, trade continued in other goods, though slaves still left the area clandestinely. The Bassa also enjoyed similar go-between status. This period also saw the introduction of Christianity to the region when the Basel Mission set up a station at Es√©ka. =German administration= Three years after the German annexation of the Cameroons in 1884, the first white men moved in, under orders of governor Julius Baron Von Soden, to explore the territories of the Beti. A later governor, Jesko Von Puttkamer, began extensive plantation farming in the south of Cameroon, particularly of cocoa, which he introduced in 1905. Native peoples were used as forced labour. In response to this and to their loss of lucrative trade to the Germans, the Ewondo revolted in 1895 but were suppressed the next year. Other rebellions occurred under the Bane and Mbidambani. A second Ewondo resistance occurred in 1907 when the Germans tried to prop up their collaborator, Charles Atangana, as the over-chief of all Ewondo. Germany made various improvements to the territory, including the building of roads from Cameroon's coast to the inland areas, beginning in 1900. The first long-distance automobile journey took place in 1913, from Kribi to Yaound√©, a distance of 280 km, in eleven hours. The Germans also brought the railroad to the area, beginning a line from Douala to Yaound√© in 1909. Work was stopped at the outbreak of World War I, however. Germany moved the capital of the colony from Buea to Yaound√© at this time. Some of the Centre's largest towns and cities were originally German outposts, including Yaound√© (founded in 1889) and Mbalmayo. A Catholic mission and school were established in Yaound√© in 1901 by the German Pallotin Fathers. This was followed by similar setups in other settlements until 1907. The Presbyterians were quick to follow, establishing a presence in 1909. =French administration= The French gained control of the Centre Province territory in 1916 after World War I. They divided Cameroon into several zones, and the current Centre Province's area fell into the Yaound√©, Ed√©a-Es√©ka, and Ebolowa- Akoafim zones. Much of France's administration of the territory was simply a continuation of policies set up by the Germans. The French continued Germany's plantations, for example, and expanded them aggressively. The French Company for the Development of Tobacco (SFDT) set up in Batchenga near Yaound√© in 1947, and the sugar plantation at Mbandjock was planted in 1964. In fact, the town of Mbandjock did not exist then but grew up around the French sugar cane. The French also maintained the German policy of propping up puppet chiefs when existing traditional rulers were uncooperative or where such native rulers were absent. They also opened a school in Yaound√© on 27 December 1933 to educate and indoctrinate the sons of chiefs. France made many more improvements to the territory, as well. To begin with, though Germany had moved the Cameroonian capital to Yaound√©, the French made it look the part. They built large, opulent government buildings there, including a governor's mansion. The railroad between Douala and Yaound√© was finished in 1927, and this was modernised in 1933. The main road from Douala and on to Bertoua was widened and improved in 1939. Yaound√© also became the location of an international airport. In the realm of education, an Advanced Primary School was placed in Yaound√© in 1939, and Ayos became the site of a nursing school in 1925. The French expansion into the region also allowed better access for missionary groups. The Seventh-day Adventists set up centres in Nanga Eboko and Yaound√©, and this religion continues to claim large numbers of followers in the province. A major Catholic seminary opened in Yaound√© in 1927. Political developments By making Yaound√© the centre of government, France also made it the centre of the colony's politics. After France made all its West African colonies self-governing in 1956, many of Cameroon's earliest political parties were located there. The biggest of these were the Union Camerounaise, with large constituencies in the Centre and North (led by Ahmido Ahidjo), and the Democrats Camerounais (DC), with support from the Yaound√© region and headed by Andr√©-Marie Mbida. Most of these parties offered a pro- independence platform. The capital was also the natural site of early political protests. When the colony's most vocal political party, Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), rioted there over raised prices at Yaound√© market stalls, for example, the government outlawed the group. This led to multiple clashes between pro- and anti-UPC factions in Yaound√©, which continued even after independence in 1960. =Post-independence= Under Cameroon's first president, Amadou Ahidjo, Cameroon was split into seven provinces. The present-day Centre and South Provinces were at this time combined into one Centre-South Province. It would remain this way until Cameroon's second president, Paul Biya, split the Centre-South into the present Centre and South Provinces on 22 August 1983. Under Ahidjo, the railway was pushed northeast, reaching B√©labo in the East Province in 1974. In an effort to better unify the north and south portions of the country, Ahidjo also ordered a road built north from Yaound√© to Ngaound√©r√© (National Road 1). Ahidjo also paved major roads, including the stretches between Douala and Yaound√© and Bafoussam and Yaound√©, beginning in 1966. Education also experienced improvement. The University of Yaound√© was founded in 1962 for a student body of 7,500. After large student protests in 1973 and 1980 against overcrowding of the facilities, that institution was decentralised, and other universities were opened in other regions of the country.

He was the founder of Bohemian Balkanology (or Balkan Studies) and Byzantine studies, and wrote extensively on Bulgarian and Serbian history. Jireƒçek was also a minister in the government of the Principality of Bulgaria for a couple of years. Life Jireƒçek was the son of Czech historian Josef Jireƒçek (1825‚Äì1888) and Bo≈æena, a daughter of Slovak philologist Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik (1795‚Äì1861). His family was deeply involved in Slavistics. Jireƒçek was brought up in Vienna and enrolled in the 1864‚Äì72 period at Theresianum, a prestigious preparatory school in Vienna. During his education, he became very interested in and studied several foreign languages (French, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Italian, Russian, English, Hungarian, Turkish and Greek). In 1872 he became a student at the Philological Faculty at the University of Prague, where he studied history and modern philology. At this time, his nearest friends included French historian Ernest Denis (1849‚Äì1921) and the sons of Bulgarian theatre director and actor Krastyo Pishurka. In 1874 he took a study trip to Croatia-Slavonia and Serbia, after which he published several essays on the history and traditions of the South Slavic countries. In 1876 he had his first book published, the History of the Bulgarians, a historiographical work spanning the medieval Bulgarian state foundation to the Ottoman conquest, which attracted great attention to the 22-year-old historian. This was due to the European public's interest in the April Uprising of the Bulgarian people, a people little known in Europe at the time. For his dissertation on the history of the Bulgarians, Jireƒçek was awarded the title of doctor in philosophy in 1876. In 1877, his habilitation work was divided between Constantinople and Belgrade (Serbia). After the end of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78), which saw the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state, he helped construct the administration, school system and economy in the newly founded Principality of Bulgaria. In 1879 he was employed by the Bulgarian government, and from May to July 1881 he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, then until 1882 as Minister of Science. In 1884, he was appointed director of the National Library in Sofia. During his stay, he devoted himself to research in Balkanology and Byzantine Studies. He published his results in numerous studies and monographs. From 1884 to 1893 he taught universal history as a full professor at the Charles University in Prague. After that, he was a professor of Slavic philology at the University of Vienna until his death in 1918. Carl Patsch succeeded the office at Vienna. Work The bulk of Jireƒçek's writings deal with the history of the South Slavs and their literature. They notably include a History of the Bulgarians (Czech and German, 1876), History of Serbs, The Principality of Bulgaria (1891), Travels in Bulgaria (Czech, 1888), etc. He mostly wrote in German. *History of the Bulgarians (; , published in Prague in 1876 *Die altb√∂hmischen Gedichte der Gr√ºnberger und K√∂niginhofer.

Olaf Tree Feller (Old Norse: √ìl√°fr tr√©telgja, Swedish: Olof Tr√§t√§lja, Norwegian: Olav Tretelgja, all meaning Olaf Woodwhittler) was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald illr√•de, ruler of the House of Yngling in the 7th century according to Ynglingatal, a Skaldic poem detailing the kings of that house. Heimskringla His mother was Gauthild, a princess of West G√∂taland, whose maternal grandfather was Olof the Sharp- sighted, the king of Nerike. His mother sent him to his foster-father Bove in West G√∂taland, where he grew up with his foster-brother Saxe who was surnamed Flette. When Olof heard of his father's death, he assembled the men who were willing to follow him and went to his kinsmen in Nerike, because after his father's atrocities, the Swedes had grown hostile towards the Ynglings. When the Swedes learnt that Olof and his kin had sought refuge in Nerike, they were attacked and had to head west through deep and mountainous forests (Kilsbergen) to Lake V√§nern and the estuary of Klar√§lven (where Karlstad is now situated). Here, they settled and cleared land. Soon they had created a whole province called V√§rmland, where they could make a good living. When the Swedes learnt that Olof was clearing land, they were amused and called him the Tree-feller. Olof married a woman named Solveig who was a daughter of Halfdan Guldtand of Soleyar. Olof and Solveigh had two sons, Ingjald Olofsson and Halfdan Hvitbeinn, who were brought up in Soleyar in the house of his mother's uncle S√∂lve. Because of king Ivar Vidfamne and his harsh rule many Swedes emigrated to V√§rmland, and they became so numerous that the province could not sustain them. The land was afflicted by famine of which the Swedes accused the king. It was an old tradition in Sweden of holding the king responsible for the wealth of the land (see Domalde). The Swedes accused Olof of neglecting his sacrifices to the gods and believed that this was the cause of the famine. The Swedish settlers thus rebelled against Olof, surrounded his house on the shores of lake V√§nern and burnt him inside it. Thus he was sacrificed to Odin, like his ancestor Domalde. Ynglingatal and Historia Norwegiae However, Historia Norwegiae says that Olof succeeded his father and ruled as the king of Sweden in peace until his death. {  Ejus filius Olavus cognomento tretelgia diu et pacifice functus regno plenus dierum obiit in Swethia.Storm, Gustav (editor) (1880).

Historia Norwegie. Museum Tusculanum Press. , p. 79.  } The lines of Ynglingatal appear to say that he was a Swedish prince (sv√≠a j√∂fri), and that he was burnt inside his hall and disappeared from Gamla Uppsala. {  :Ok vi√∞ v√°g, :vi√∞ar (telgju) :hr√¶ √ìlafs :hofgyldir svalg, :ok gl√≥√∞fj√°lgr :gervar leysti :sonr Fornj√≥ts :af Sv√≠a j√∂fri. :S√° √°ttkonr :fr√° Upps√∂lum :Lof√∞a kyns :fyrir l√∂ngu hvarf.The original text at Heimskringla Norr√∏ne Tekster og Kvad  } Archaeology :Source Along the lower parts of the river By√§lven in V√§rmland, there are three large barrows, which legend attributes to Olof Tr√§t√§lja. Moreover, there are many hillforts near this river and the northern shore of Lake V√§nern testifying to a violent period. Archaeological excavations from one of the hillforts, Villkorsberget, show that it was burnt in a period corresponding to Olof (510‚Äì680). Notes King Olof Tratalja is of House Ynglinga which are descendants to House Munso from the 10th and 11th centuries. The previous editor from Gustav Storm of 1880 had shown King Olof Tratalja being from 1820s-1880s before vanishing when his house caught fire from attackers and fled for safety with his family. And a new ruler took over immediately after political corruption being a French General commissioned by Napoleon.

He was the son of David Rollock of Powis, near Stirling. He received his early education at the school of Stirling from Thomas Buchanan, a nephew of George Buchanan, and, after graduating from the University of St Andrews in 1577, became a regent there in 1580. In 1583 be was appointed by the Edinburgh town council sole regent of the towns college (Academia Jacobi Sexti, afterwards the University of Edinburgh), and three years later he received from the same source the title of principal, or first master, and was engaged in lecturing on philosophy. When the staff of the young college was increased by the appointment of additional regents, he assumed with consent of the presbytery the office of professor of theology. From 1587 he also preached regularly in the East Kirk every Sunday at 7 am, and in 1596 he accepted one of the eight ministerial charges of the city. He took a prominent part in the somewhat troubled church politics of the day, and distinguished himself by gentleness and tact, as well as ability. He was appointed on several occasions to committees of presbytery and assembly on pressing ecclesiastical business. He was elected moderator of the General Assembly held at Dundee in May 1597. In 1598 he was translated to the parish church of the Upper Tolbooth, Edinburgh, and immediately thereafter to that of the Grey Friars (then known as the Magdalen Church). He died in Edinburgh on 8 February 1599. Life Robert Rollock, first principal of the university of Edinburgh, born about 1555, was son of David Rollock, laird of Powis, near Stirling, and Mary Livingstone, connected with the noble family of that name. Hercules Rollock was his elder brother. He was educated at the grammar school of Stirling under Thomas Buchanan, a nephew of George Buchanan the historian, and in 1574 he entered St. Salvator's College in the university of St. Andrews, where he so greatly distinguished himself that soon after taking his M.A. degree he was appointed one of the regents or professors of the college. In 1580 he was also made examiner of arts, and in the same year director of the faculty of arts. At this time he was continuing his studies in divinity, and James Melville states that in 1580 ‚Äòhe had the honour to be his teacher in the Hebrew tongue‚Äô (Diary, Wodrow Soc. p. 86). In 1583, on the recommendation of Knox's successor at St. Giles' James Lawson, he was appointed by the town council of Edinburgh to be sole regent of the newly founded college of James VI, afterwards known as the university of Edinburgh. His appointment was for one year certain; but should the college be successful it was provided that he should be advanced to the highest post or title that might be created. His salary was fixed at 40l. Scots, with the students' fees, 40s. for sons of burgesses, and 3l. or more for other students; the council moreover agreeing to ‚Äòsustain him and one servant in their ordinary expenses,‚Äô and to give him an augmentation not exceeding forty merks, should the fees from the students not afford him a sufficient salary. In 1585‚Äì6 he took the title of ‚Äòprincipal or first master.‚Äô He carried his class through to graduation in 1587, after which, other regents having been appointed, he gave up the teaching of philosophy, and, with the sanction of the presbytery of Edinburgh, was appointed professor of theology at a salary of four hundred merks, retaining at the same time his position as principal. On 5 Sept. 1587 he also began to preach, though not as an ordained minister, every Sunday morning in the East Kirk at seven A.M.; but on 13 Dec. 1589 another was appointed to that duty. In 1596 he entered on the full charge of the congregation. In 1590 Rollock was appointed assessor to the moderator of the general assembly, and in 1591 he was named one of a committee of the presbytery of Edinburgh to hold a conference with the king on the affairs of the kirk (Calderwood, Hist. v. 130). In connection with the prosecution of the Earls of Angus, Huntly, and Errol for their attempts ‚Äòagainst the true religion,‚Äô he was named one of a committee of the assembly to confer with a committee of the estates (ib. p. 277). In 1595 he was chosen one of a commission for the visitation of the colleges (ib. p. 371), and in the following year he was appointed with three other ministers to remonstrate with the king for his ‚Äòhard dealing with the kirk,‚Äô and especially for his prosecution of David Black (ib. p. 463). Subsequently Rollock, who, according to Calderwood, was ‚Äòa godly man, but simple in the matters of the church government, credulous, easily led by counsel, and tutored in a manner by his old master, Thomas Buchanan‚Äô (ib. viii. 47), was won over to support the policy of the king in church matters, and at the instance of the king's party he was chosen moderator of the assembly that met at Dundee in May 1597. According to Calderwood, he ‚Äòkythed [discovered] his own weakness in following the humours of the king and his commissioners‚Äô (ib. v. 650). Rollock supported the proposal made in 1595 that certain ministers should be allowed to sit and vote in parliament as bishops, affirming that ‚Äòlordship could not be denied them that were to sit in parliament, and allowance of rent to maintain their dignities‚Äô (ib. p. 697). It was generally supposed that he himself was not averse to such a promotion in his own case. In 1598 he became minister of the Upper Tolbooth‚Äîprobably the west portion of St. Giles's Cathedral‚Äîand on 18 April of the same year he was admitted to Magdalen Church, afterwards Greyfriars. He died on 8 Feb. (old style) 1598‚Äì9, in his forty-fourth year. By his wife Helen, daughter of James, baron of Kinnaird, he had a posthumous daughter, Jean, who married Robert Balcanquhal, minister of Tranent. Although ‚Äògrieved‚Äô at what he deemed Rollock's weakness in lending his aid to the king's ecclesiastical policy, Calderwood admits that he was ‚Äòa man of good conversation and a powerful preacher‚Äô (ib. p. 732). He was reckoned to be of ‚Äògreat learning,‚Äô and he discharged the duties of professor and principal of the university with great success. He was the author of numerous theological works, the majority of them being commentaries or expositions of scripture which, although somewhat commonplace and superficial, are of interest as among the earliest of this species of literature in Scotland.

Early life Chapman was born in Washington, D.C. He attended public schools in Sulphur Springs; he received an undergraduate degree in business administration from the University of Texas at Austin (1968) and a J.D. degree from the Southern Methodist University School of Law in Dallas, Texas (1970). After a stint in private practice, Chapman became the District Attorney for the Eighth Judicial District of Texas (1976‚Äì1985), during which time he achieved a 99 percent conviction record and a national reputation as a tough, law and order prosecutor. Chapman served in leadership roles with the Texas District and County Attorneys Association and the National District Attorneys Association. Later, he set up his own practice and was senior partner of the law firm of Chapman, Price, Hughes & Bauer. He also became chairman of a local community bank. Congressional career Chapman was elected in 1985 as a Democrat in the 99th Congress during a highly visible special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of U.S. Representative Sam B. Hall. He defeated the Republican choice, Edd Hargett, a former professional football player, by just over 1,900 votes.https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=174731 However, he would never face another contest anywhere near that close, and was reelected to the five succeeding Congresses (August 3, 1985 ‚Äì January 3, 1997). He was not a candidate for reelection to the One Hundred Fifth Congress in 1996, but was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination to the United States Senate in 1996. While in Congress, Chapman served four years on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which sets committee assignments and the legislative agenda for the caucus. He also served as chairman of the Texas Democratic congressional delegation and as a member of the Democratic Whip organization. Chapman served on the House Appropriations Committee, working on numerous projects including restoration and development of an Army Corps of Engineers-maintained East Texas lake called Cooper Lake, located between Cooper and Sulphur Springs. In honor of his work, Congress later enacted legislation formally renaming the lake as \\"Jim Chapman Lake.\\" Prior to his service on the Appropriations Committee, he served on the Public Works and Transportation Committee; Small Business Committee; and the Science, Space and Technology Committee. Chapman gained notoriety during the Clinton‚ÄìLewinsky scandal when it was revealed in the Starr Report that President Clinton was receiving fellatio from Monica Lewinsky while on the phone with Chapman on November 15, 1995 between 9:25pm and 9:30pm. https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/sexual-congress/ Current work After Congress, in 1999, Chapman became a partner in Houston-based Bracewell & Patterson, LLP (now Bracewell, LLP), practicing law in their Washington D.C. and Austin offices. As a partner, he co-chaired the firm's government relations practice in both Washington D.C. and Texas. In 2015 Chapman retired to a part-time private law practice in Horseshoe Bay, Texas.

The characters' hyper- intelligent witty repartee, reminiscent of New Yorkers in a Tama Janowitz novel, highlights the tragedy of the family's social and economic descent. The first person narrator of the novel is 19-year-old Maud Slivenowicz, whose major source of knowledge is Reader's Digest. Her mother, Evangeline, has five children by five different deadbeat fathers. Without a regular income, the Slivenowicz family dream of becoming movie stars, and at the end of the book it seems one of Maud's brothers might actually be given a role in a television commercial. The title of the book relates to a famous line in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha.

(; 6 February 160818 July 1697) was a Jesuit priest, Portuguese diplomat, orator, preacher, philosopher, writer, and member of the Royal Council to the King of Portugal. In the book 'History of Brazil, Volume 2 ‚Äì 1817' By Robert Southey, Antonio Vieira advised the King of Portugal and later became a member of the Royal Council.

In 1614 he accompanied his parents to the colony of Brazil, where his father had been posted as a registrar. He received his education at the Jesuit college at Bahia. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1625, under Father Fern√£o Cardim, and two years later pronounced his first vows. At the age of eighteen he was teaching rhetoric, and a little later dogmatic theology, at the college of Olinda, besides writing the \\"annual letters\\" of the province. In 1635 he entered the priesthood. He soon began to distinguish himself as an orator, and the three patriotic sermons he delivered at Bahia (1638‚Äì40) are remarkable for their imaginative power and dignity of language. The Sermon for the Good Success of the Arms of Portugal Against Those of Holland was considered by the Abb√© Raynal to be \\"perhaps the most extraordinary discourse ever heard from a Christian pulpit. Fr. Ant√≥nio Vieira, preaching When the revolution of 1640 placed John IV on the throne of Portugal, Brazil gave him her allegiance, and Vieira was chosen to accompany the viceroy's son to Lisbon to congratulate the new king. His talents and aptitude for affairs impressed John IV so favorably that he appointed him tutor to the Infante Dom Pedro, royal preacher, and a member of the Royal Council. Vieira did efficient work in the War and Navy Departments, revived commerce, urged the foundation of a national bank and the organization of the Brazilian Trade Company. Vieira used the pulpit to propound measures for improving the general and particularly the economic condition of Portugal. His pen was as busy as his voice, and in four notable pamphlets he advocated the creation of companies of commerce, denounced as unchristian a society which discriminated against New Christians (Muslim and Jewish converts), called for the reform of the procedure of the Inquisition and the admission of Jewish and foreign traders, with guarantees for their security from religious persecution. Moreover, he did not spare his own estate, for in his Sexagesima sermon he boldly attacked the current style of preaching, its subtleties, affectation, obscurity and abuse of metaphor, and declared the ideal of a sermon to be one which sent men away \\" not contented with the preacher, but discontented with themselves.\\" In 1647 Vieira began his career as a diplomat, in the course of which he visited England, France, the Netherlands and Italy. In his Papel Forte he urged the cession of Pernambuco to the Dutch as the price of peace, while his mission to Rome in 1650 was undertaken in the hope of arranging a marriage between the heir to the throne of Portugal and the only daughter of King Philip IV of Spain. His success, freedom of speech and reforming zeal had made him enemies on all sides, and only the intervention of the king prevented his expulsion from the Society of Jesus, so that prudence counselled his return to Brazil. In his youth he had vowed to consecrate his life to the conversion of the African slaves and native Indians of his adopted country, and arriving in Maranh√£o early in 1653 he recommenced his apostolic labors, which had been interrupted during his stay of fourteen years in the Old World. Starting from Par√°, he penetrated to the banks of the Tocantins, making numerous converts to Christianity and European civilization among the most violent tribes; but after two years of unceasing labour, during which every difficulty was placed in his way by the colonial authorities, he saw that the Indians must be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the governors, to prevent their exploitation, and placed under the control of the members of a single religious society. Accordingly, in June 1654 he set sail for Lisbon to plead the cause of the Indians, and in April 1655 he obtained from the king a series of decrees which placed the missions under the Society of Jesus, with himself as their superior, and prohibited the enslavement of the natives, except in certain specified cases. Returning with this charter of freedom, he organized the missions over a territory having a coast-line of 400 leagues, and a population of 200,000 souls, and in the next six years (1655‚Äì61) the indefatigable missionary set the crown on his work. After a time, however, the colonists, attributing the shortage of slaves and the consequent diminution in their profits to the Jesuits, began actively to oppose Vieira, and they were joined by members of the secular clergy and the other Orders who were jealous of the monopoly enjoyed by the company in the government of the Indians. Vieira was accused of want of patriotism and usurpation of jurisdiction, and in 1661, after a popular revolt, the authorities sent him with thirty-one other Jesuit missionaries back to Portugal. He found his friend King John IV dead and the court a prey to faction, but, dauntless as ever in the pursuit of his ambition, he resorted to his favorite arm of preaching, and on Epiphany Day, 1662, in the royal chapel, he replied to his persecutors in a famous rhetorical effort, and called for the execution of the royal decrees in favor of the Indians. Circumstances were against him, however, and the count of Castelmelhor, fearing his influence at court, had him exiled first to Porto and then to Coimbra; but in both these places he continued his work of preaching, and the reform of the Inquisition also occupied his attention. To silence him his enemies then denounced him to that tribunal, and he was cited to appear before the Holy Office at Coimbra to answer points smacking of heresy in his sermons, conversations and writings. He had believed in the prophecies of a 16th-century shoemaker poet, Bandarra, dealing with the coming of a ruler who would inaugurate an epoch of unparalleled prosperity for the church and for Portugal, these new prosperous times were to be called the Quinto Imp√©rio or \\"Fifth Empire\\" (also called \\"Sebastianism\\"). In Vieira's famous opus, Clavis Prophetarum, he had endeavoured to prove the truth of his dreams from passages of Scripture. As he refused to submit, the Inquisitors kept him in prison from October 1665 to December 1667, and finally imposed a sentence which prohibited him from teaching, writing or preaching. It was a heavy blow for the Jesuits, and though Vieira recovered his freedom and much of his prestige shortly afterwards on the accession of King Pedro II, it was determined that he should go to Rome to procure revision of the sentence, which still hung over him though the penalties had been removed. During a six years' residence in the Eternal City, Vieira won his greatest triumphs. Pope Clement X invited him to preach before the College of Cardinals, and he became confessor to Queen Christina of Sweden and a member of her literary academy. At the request of the pope he drew up a report of two hundred pages on the Inquisition in Portugal, with the result that after a judicial inquiry Pope Innocent XI suspended it in Portugal for seven years (1674‚Äì81). Ultimately, Vieira returned to Portugal with a papal bull exempting him from the jurisdiction of the grand inquisitor, and in January 1681 he embarked for Brazil. He resided in Bahia and occupied himself in revising his sermons for publication, and in 1687 he became superior of the province. A false accusation of complicity in an assassination, and the intrigues of members of his own Company, clouded his last months, and on 18 July 1697 he died in Salvador, Bahia. The first page of \\"Historia do Futuro\\", first edition His works form perhaps the greatest monument of Portuguese prose. Two hundred discourses exist to prove his fecundity, while his versatility is shown by the fact that he could treat the same subject differently on half a dozen occasions. His letters, simple and conversational in style, have a deep historical and political interest, and form documents of the first value for the history of the period. Quote \\"We are what we do. What we don't do, doesn't exist. Therefore, we only exist on days when we do. On the days when we don't do, we simply endure\\". \\"The purpose for men who have invented the books was to cherish the memory of past things, against the tyranny of time and against forgetting men.\\" \\"Holland, is the land of which flows with milk, and Brazil is the land which flows with honey; and when the one is joined to the other, they become wholly and properly the Land of Promise, a land flowing with milk and honey.\\" In the book 'History of Brazil, Volume 2 ‚Äì 1817' By Robert Southey, Antonio Vieira compares Holland and Brazil to Milk and Honey. Works His principal works are: *Serm√µes (Sermons) (15 vols., Lisbon, 1679‚Äì1748); there are many subsequent editions, but none complete; translations exist in Spanish, Italian, German and French, which have gone through several editions Archive *Hist√≥ria do Futuro (History of the Future) (Lisbon, 1718; 2nd ed., ibid., 1755); this and the Quinto Imp√©rio and this Clavis Prophetarum seem to be in essence one and the same book in different redactions *Cartas (Letters) (3 vols., Lisbon, 1735‚Äì46) *Not√≠cias rec√¥nditas do modo de proceder a Inquisi√ß√£o de Portugal com os seus presos (News on how the Portuguese Inquisition proceeds with its prisoners) (Lisbon, 1821) *Arte de Furtar (The Art of Stealing) published under Vieira's name in many editions; is now known not to be a work by him Sermoens do P. Antonio Vieyra da Companhia de Jesu, pr√®gador de Sua Magestade, Septima Parte A badly edited edition of the works of Vieira in 27 volumes appeared in Lisbon, 1854‚Äì58. There are unpublished manuscripts of his in the British Museum in London, and in the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris. A bibliography of Vieira will be found in Sommervogel, Biblioth√®que de la compagnie de Jesus, viii. 653‚Äì85. The Complete Works of Father Ant√≥nio Vieira, annotated and updated, began to be published in 2013, nearly four centuries after his birth. This 30 volumes publication includes his complete letters, sermons, prophetic works, political writings, writings on Jews and Indians, as well as his poetry and theatre; and it is the first complete and carefully edited publication of all of Vieira's prolific written work. One of the largest editorial projects of its kind, it was the result of an international cooperation between various Luso-Brazilian research institutions and scientific, cultural and literary academies, under the aegis of the Rectory of the University of Lisbon. More than 20 thousand folios of manuscripts and printed pages attributed to Vieira were analyzed and compared, in dozens of libraries and archives in Portugal, Brazil, Spain, France, Italy, England, Holland, Mexico and in the United States of America. About one quarter of The Complete Works are made of previously undiscovered and unreleased texts. The project, directed by Jos√© Eduardo Franco and Pedro Calafate, was developed by CLEPUL in partnership with Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia, and published by C√≠rculo de Leitores, with the final volume to be released in 2014. Although this is a Portuguese edition, a selection of his works will be made available in 12 languages as part of the project. Recognition Ant√≥nio Vieira is considered one of the literary greats of the Portuguese-speaking world. The Padre Ant√≥nio Vieira Chair in Portuguese Studies, at the Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica-Rio de Janeiro was created on 7 October 1994, to train teachers and researchers in the social sciences. Promoting academic exchanges between Brazil and Portugal, the Chair's main aim has been to deepen the cultural dialog that already exists between the two countries within the university context. The Chair is involved in the training of teachers in the areas of Portuguese Literature and Culture, Portuguese Language, and Lusophone Literatures. In 1997 Portugal issued a commemorative coin to mark the 300th anniversary of the death of Father Vieira. Portugal issued a stamp in 2008, celebrating the 400th anniversary of Vieira's birth (1608). Brasil has issued already two Vieira stamps, in 1941Antonio Vieira, SJ \\"Father Antonio Vieira, SJ\\", Jesuit Stamps and 1997. A statue of Father Ant√≥nio Vieira by the sculptor Marco Fidalgo, was unveiled on the Largo Trindade Coelho near the church of S√£o Roque in 2017, on the initiative of the Holy House of Mercy of Lisbon, Portugal.

He developed his ideas on this topic in The Re-Naturalized Human, a pioneering book from 1977 which was awarded the European Prize of Ecology. Based on the ideas of the Chicago School, Pelt's theories advocated for a better integration of humans into their environment and developed a concept concerning the relation between \\"stones and waters\\". His ideas were materialized in Metz with the establishment of extensive open areas surrounding the Moselle and the Seille rivers and the development of large areas for walking. He died on 23 December 2015. Moselle river in Metz during the early 70s was one of the major materializations of Jean-Marie Pelt's urban ecology and planning concepts.

(Illustration by Gerhard Munthe) Eystein Halfdansson (Old Norse: Eysteinn H√°lfdansson) was the son of Halfdan Hvitbeinn of the House of Yngling according to Norse tradition. He inherited the throne of Romerike. Ari Thorgilsson in his √çslendingab√≥k calls him Eystein the Fart (Old norse: Eystein fret) without comment, in his king list, just naming his father and his son. Snorri does not call him by this nickname, but does give us a colorful story of his life. His wife was Hild, the daughter of the king of Vestfold, Erik Ragnarsson. Erik had no son, so Eystein obtained Vestfold as his wife's inheritance. According to Ynglingasaga, Eystein died returning from a viking raid to Varna, on the eastern side of the Oslofjord. Eystein's men had finished looting and pillaging the area and were already almost across the fjord, when King Skj√∂ld of Varna, a great warlock, arrived at the beach and saw the sails of Eystein's ships. He waved his cloak and blew into it which caused a sailbearing spar (boom) of one close sailing ship in heavy sea to swing and hit Eystein so that he fell overboard and drowned. His body was salvaged and buried in a mound at Borre. Eystein was succeeded by his son Halfdan the Mild.

After the war, he received a B.A. from the University of Denver in 1949, and a J.D. from that university's College of Law in 1951. He was admitted to the bar in 1951 and practiced law in Taylor, Michigan. He was justice of the peace for Taylor Township, 1955‚Äì1957; city attorney for Melvindale, 1957‚Äì1959; and attorney for Taylor Township, 1957‚Äì1964. He was a delegate to the Michigan constitutional convention, 1961‚Äì1962, which drafted the state constitution adopted in 1963. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate, 1962‚Äì1964; member and officer of Michigan's Sixteenth District Democratic Organization, 1952‚Äì1964; delegate to Michigan Democratic conventions, 1952‚Äì1970, and to the Democratic National Convention in 1968. He was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives for the 89th and the fourteen succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1965 to January 3, 1995. He was chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service in the 97th through 101st Congresses, and of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 102nd and 103rd Congresses. He did not seek re-election in the 1994 election. Ford died in 2004 at his home in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan of complications from a stroke and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Despite their shared surname and home state, William D. Ford was not related to either the Henry Ford family or U.S. president Gerald Ford.

They base their ideal sound not on technical measurements and theory but rather on getting a sound most true to the live listening experience. Their amplifiers have been used in several Recording Studios, including Michael Jackson and Abbey Road Studios.  History  Electrocompaniet was established in 1973 by Per Abrahamsen and Svein Erik B√∏rja. Their idea was to create a Transistor amplifier that did not sound as bad as the transistor amplifiers did at the time. They based the circuits on research done by Finnish Dr. Matti Otala of Tampere University of Technology. The finished product was a 25 Watt power amplifier named \\"The 2 Channel Audio Power Amplifier\\", It was also called \\"The Otala Amplifier\\". They continued development on the product. And in 1976 The world's biggest Hifi Magazine at the time ¬®The Audio Critic magazine¬® reviewed the amplifier and wrote: ‚ÄúAudio freaks ‚Äì eat your hearts out. This is the world‚Äôs best-sounding amplifier.‚Äù And in 1991 Michael Jackson's producer Bruce Swedien was contacted by Nils Bjarne Kvam one of the biggest producers in Norway at the time, and he told him about the amplifiers of Electrocompaniet, and Swedien started getting interested. The amplifier was packed and shipped to the US in September 1991. Bruce was busy at the time since he was working with the last mix to Jackson's Dangerous. He LOVED the amplifiers and wanted to use it on the album, but the album was almost done, and he would then have to remaster it all over again since the difference was so big. Swedien was ready to use the amplifiers on the next albums. He used it for the first time with Sergio Mendez, and when he walked in the recording studio with Jackson in January 1995 he really started using them. The next two albums History and Invincible was mastered with the amplifiers, and both albums thanked Electrocompaniet with '\`Special thanks to Electrocompaniet¬® with logo on its covers. In 2004 the company went bankrupt, but in 2007 the company was bought up by Norwegian company \\"Westcontrol\\" and got a new CEO: Mikal Dregggevik. All production was moved to Tau, near Stavanger. Today they are represented in over 50 countries worldwide.  Notable products  = The 2 channel audio power amplifier = The 2 channel audio power amplifier was the first amplifier Electrocompaniet produced. It was a 2x25 Watt Stereo power amplifier based on the works of Dr. Matti Otala on TIM-free transistor design. It has been updated and re-produced several times. Since it was only 2x25 Watt Electrocompaniet designed bigger amplifiers with more wattage but with the same sound characteristics. = NEMO AW 600 monaural class A reference amplifier= The AW600 NEMO monaural class A reference amplifier\\" by Electrocompaniet is used in listening and reference studios across the world. It is often coupled with the Bowers & Wilkins Nautilus reference, and the 800 Diamond series loudspeakers. Electrocompaniet clearly made this amplifier to be a match with the Nautilus loudspeakers. At the time of realization for Nautilus there were few power amplifiers capable of delivering the power that they required. Electrocompaniet named their new mono amplifier after Nemo, the fictional captain of the Nautilus submarine from the Jules Verne Novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. NEMO was at some point (and still might be) at use in Abbey Road Studios. The NEMO has collected rave reviews from among others Stereophile USA and Haute Fidelite France. At 1√ó600 Watts in 8 ohms it is among the most powerful high-end amplifiers in existence, and should be able to run most Hi-Fi Speakers produced. = EMC 1 CD player= In 1998 Electrocompaniet produced one of the best CD players in the world regardless of price range, The EMC 1. Since then Electrocompaniet has produced several updates of the EMC. The one that is currently in production(2020) is the EMC 1 MKV. The MKV features 24-bit upsampling, SACD, electromechanical cancellation system, fully balanced D/A converter, separate transformers and PCB¬®s. = ECG 1 turntable= Late 2014/2015 Electrocompaniet developed their first turntable ever after years of requests from customers and distributors. The turntable uses a Jelco tonearm, and a custom made cartridge by pick-up manufacturer Soundsmith. The plinth is made of three layers, consisting of two layers acrylic, and one aluminum layer in the middle. This so-called '¬¥sandwich'¬¥ construction isolates the plinth from vibrations and resonance. To keep all noise to a minimum, the motor is completely isolated from the plinth so as little as possible disturbance from the motor will reach the pickup. It has a motor control that can play 33 1/3, 45 and 78 RPM records.

It was the first battle in which U.S. forces were able to defeat the experienced German tank units, but the followup to the battle was inconclusive.Haycock p. 42 Background The U.S. II Corps had been badly mauled in its first encounter with Axis forces in Tunisia during a series of battles that culminated in the disastrous Battle of the Kasserine Pass in late February 1943. Erwin Rommel‚Äîpoised on the threshold of a complete tactical victory‚Äîturned from the battle to return to his eastward-facing defenses at the Mareth Line when he heard of the approach of Bernard Montgomery‚Ä≤s British 8th Army. Thus the battle concluded with the U.S. forces still in the field, but having lost ground and men, and with little confidence in some key commanders. In the last week of January 1943, despite a massive artillery bombardment, the Italian 14th Bersaglieri Battalion of the 131st Armoured Division Centauro dug in near Djebel Rihana. Terrible Terry Allen: Combat General of World War II - The Life of an American Soldier, Gerald Astor, p. 139, Random House, 2008 Harold V. Boyle, an Irish war correspondent, wrote that a second attack was required using grenades and bayonets in order to evict the Italians: > Artillery and aircraft may harass but cannot dislodge him. Only bullets and > bayonets of rival riflemen can do that. This was well illustrated in the > Ousseltia Valley campaign in January when tanks and artillery laid down one > of the finest barrages of the campaign but couldn't rout Italians dug in > like moles in the hills bordering the road to Kairouan. The artillery was > beautiful to see but they couldn't do the job alone. Finally American > infantry swarmed up the hills at night and flushed the Italians out in > droves with hand grenades and the pointed persuasion of their > bayonets.Tunisia Campaign Puts U.S. Infantryman Back On Pedestal The American command reacted to its reverses against German and Italian forces with a prompt and sweeping series of changes in command, discipline, and tactics. Also, large units were kept massed rather than being broken up into smaller, unsupported elements as had been done under U.S. II Corps Commander Lloyd Fredendall. Close air support was also improved. On 6 March 1943, George Patton took command of the U.S. II Corps from Lloyd Fredendall, who had been in command before and during the Kasserine engagement. His first move was to organize his U.S. II Corps for an offensive back toward the Eastern Dorsal chain of the Atlas Mountains. If successful, this would threaten the right rear of the Axis forces defending the Mareth Line facing Montgomery's 8th Army and ultimately make their position untenable. Patton's style of leadership was very different from his predecessor: he is reported to have issued an order in connection with an attack on a hill position ending \\"I expect to see such casualties among officers, particularly staff officers, as will convince me that a serious effort has been made to capture this objective\\".Hunt (1990), p. 169. On 17 March, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division moved forward into the almost abandoned plains, taking the town of Gafsa and preparing it as a forward supply base for further operations. On the 18th, the 1st Ranger Battalion‚Äîled by Colonel William O. Darby‚Äîpushed ahead, and occupied the oasis of El Guettar, again meeting with little opposition. The Italian defenders instead retreated and took up positions in the hills overlooking the town, thereby blocking the mountain pass (of the same name) leading south out of the interior plains to the coastal plain. Another operation by the Rangers raided an Italian position and took 200\\"In March 1943 the 1st Ranger Battalion led Gen. Patton's drive to capture the heights of El Guettar with a 12-mile night march across mountainous terrain, with intent to surprise the enemy positions from the rear. By dawn the Rangers swooped down on the surprised Italians, cleared the El Guettar Pass, captured 200 prisoners, and then held their positions against a series of enemy counterattacks.\\" Darby's Rangers 1942-45, Mir Bahmanyar, p. 9, Osprey Publishing, 2012 prisoners on the night of 20 March, scaling a sheer cliff and passing ammunition and equipment up hand- over-hand. Battle upright=1.25 The Axis army commanders had become aware of the U.S. movements and decided that the 10th Panzer Division should stop them. Rommel had departed Tunisia for Germany on 9 March before the battle, leaving von Arnim in control of the newly named Africa Korps. Von Arnim also held Rommel's opinion on the low quality of the American forces and felt that a spoiling attack would be enough to clear them from the Eastern Dorsals again. At 06:00 on 23 March, 50 tanks of Broich's 10th Panzer emerged from the pass into the El Guettar valley at . German motorised units in halftracks and motorcycle sidecars broke off from formation and charged the infantry on the top of the hill. The halftracks would move up the hill as far they could and then the infantry they carried would dismount while covered by fire from 88mms. The Germans were maneuvering to hit American artillery anchored on the hill. They quickly overran front-line infantry and artillery positions. Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr.‚Äîcommanding the U.S. 1st Infantry Division‚Äîwas threatened when two tanks came near his headquarters, but he shrugged off suggestions of moving, \\"I will like hell pull out, and I'll shoot the first bastard who does.\\"Atkinson, p. 440 The German attack lost momentum when it ran into a minefield. When the Germans slowed to reorganise, U.S. artillery and anti-tank guns engaged, including 31 M10 tank destroyers which had recently arrived. Over the next hour, 30 of the 10th Panzer's tanks were destroyed, and by 09:00 they retreated from the valley. A second attempt was made at 16:45, after waiting for the infantry to form up. Once again the U.S. artillery was able to disrupt the attack, eventually breaking the charge and inflicting heavy losses. Realizing that further attacks were hopeless, the rest of the 10th Panzer Division dug in on hills to the east or retreated back to the German headquarters at Gab√®s. =Allied attacks= On 19 March, the British 8th Army launched their attack on the Mareth Line, at first with little success. Over the next week, the U.S. forces slowly moved forward to take the rest of the interior plains and set up lines across the entire Eastern Dorsals. The German and Italian defenses and reserves were heavy, and the progress was both slow and costly. On 23 March, the 10th Panzer Division attacked Lieutenant-Colonel Robert H. York's 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, and the German tanks broke through the valley between the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 1st Division, reaching a position about six miles to the rear of the 1st Battalion. Infantry Journal, Volumes 54-55, p. 42, United States Infantry Association, 1944 In the action, the German tanks and self-propelled guns along with German troops riding in carriers and trucks overran the 32nd Field Artillery Battalion and part of the 5th Field Artillery Battalion, and the Italian High command reported that 40 tanks had been destroyed and 170 Allied troops had been captured in \\"central and southern Tunisia\\".\\"Yankee Units Within Hour's Drive of Sea; Blast 30 Nazi Tanks\\" Reading Eagle March 24, 1943 p18 On 26 March, in Operation Supercharge II, a British force sent via an outflanking inland route attacked the Tebaga Gap to the north of the Mareth line, and their breakthrough left the Mareth defenses untenable. The Axis forces retreated about 40 miles to a new line set up at Wadi Akarit, north of Gab√®s at . This made the U.S. position even more valuable, since the road through El Guettar led directly into Gab√®s. By 30 March the U.S. forces were in position for an offensive south from El Guettar. In order to start a breakout, the two original Italian strongpoints on Hill 369 and Hill 772 had to be taken, one after the other.\\"Fought in the rugged region south of Gafsa, the Battle of El Guettar was a bona fide victory that did show American mettle ... Infantrymen of the 9th Infantry Division were in the thick of the action in the mountainous region. Italians accounted for most of the enemy forces.\\" I Was with Patton, D. A. Lande, p.50, Turner Zenith Imprint, 2002 The U.S. plan involved the U.S. 1st and 9th Infantry Divisions, and Combat Command 1/3 of the U.S. 1st Armored Division, collectively known as \\"Benson Force\\". This force attacked Hill 369 on the afternoon of 30 March but ran into mines and anti-tank fire, losing five tanks and a rifle company from the 2nd Battalion of Colonel Edwin H. Randle's 47th Infantry Regiment that was forced to surrender. The 9th Infantry Division: Old Reliables, John Sperry, p.11, Turner Publishing Company, 2000 The tanks were withdrawn, and the 1st and 9th attacked again the next day at 06:00, gaining some ground and taking several hundred prisoners. However, an Italian counter-attack drove them back from their newly gained positions, and by 12:45 they were back where they started with the loss of nine tanks and two tank destroyers. A further attempt the next day on 1 April also failed, after barely getting started. Private Emil J. Dedonato remembers that Patton drove up to the 47th Regiment's command post, unhappy that the initial attacks had failed: > Patton was in a huffy mood and stormed over to see Colonel Randle in his > Jeep. It was obvious he wasn't pleased with the initial results of the night > attack. I'll never forget Colonel Randle's instructions as they moved into > El Guettar: \\"Where we're going you won't need a physic!\\"9th Division > Veterans www.ww2survivorstories.com At this point Patton received orders to start the attempt on Hill 772, even though Hill 369 was still under Italian control. The 9th was moved to Hill 772, leaving the 1st on Hill 369. By 3 April, the 1st had finally cleared Hill 369, but the battle on Hill 772 continued. The Italian commander‚ÄîGeneral Messe‚Äîthen called in support from the German 21st Panzer Division, further slowing progress. The tempo of the operations slowed, and the lines remained largely static. Aftermath U.S. Army Africa staff visited El Guettar in 2010, where foxholes from 67 years ago remain. On 6 April, the British 8th Army once again overran the Axis lines at the Battle of Wadi Akarit, and a full retreat started. On the morning of 7 April, Benson Force moved through the positions held by the 1st and 9th divisions, and raced down the abandoned El Guettar-Gab√®s road, where it met the lead elements of the 8th Army at 17:00. With the last Axis line of defense in the south of Tunisia broken, the remaining forces made a run to join the other Axis forces in the north. Tunis fell to the Allies in early May.

Halhed was born at Westminster, and was educated at Harrow School, where he began a close friendship with Richard Brinsley Sheridan. While at Oxford he undertook oriental studies under the influence of William Jones. Accepting a writership in the service of the East India Company, he went out to India, and there, at the suggestion of Warren Hastings, translated the Hindu legal code from a Persian version of the original Sanskrit. This translation was published in 1776 as A Code of Gentoo Laws. In 1778 he published a Bengali grammar, to print which he set up the first Bengali press in India. In 1785 Halhed returned to England, and from 1790‚Äì1795 was Member of Parliament for Lymington, Hants. For some time he was a disciple of Richard Brothers, and a speech in parliament in defence of Brothers made it impossible for him to remain in the House of Commons, from which he resigned in 1795. He subsequently obtained a home appointment under the East India Company. He died in London on 18 February 1830. Early life Nathaniel Brassey Halhed was born in a merchant family to William Halhed, a bank director, on 25 May 1751 and christened in St Peter le Poer, Old Broad Street; his mother was Frances Caswall, daughter of John Caswall, Member of Parliament for . He went to Harrow School from the age of seven to seventeen. Halhed entered Christ Church, Oxford on 13 July 1768, at the age of 17.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Halhed, Nathaniel Brassey He remained there for three years but did not take a degree. William Jones had preceded him from Harrow to Oxford and they shared an intellectual relationship. At Oxford he learnt some Persian. Halhed's father was disappointed in him and decided to send him to India under the employment of the East India Company through his connections. His petition for a writership was granted by Harry Verelst. Appointed on 4 December 1771, Halhed was forewarned and had learned accounting. In India Halhed was first placed in the accountant general's office under Lionel Darrell. He was next used as a Persian translator, and was sent to Kasimbazar for practical experience, and also to learn about the silk trade, by William Aldersey. It was in Kasimbazar that Halhed acquired Bengali, for dealing with the aurungs (weaving districts). In Bengal he had several romantic interests: Elizabeth Pleydell, a certain Nancy, Diana Rochfort, and Henrietta Yorke. Halhed became one of Warren Hastings's favorites, and a believer in his approach to Indian affairs. On 5 July 1774 the Governor asked for an assistant for Persian documents, in addition to the munshis, and Halhed was appointed. Marriage After wooing several accomplished women, Halhed married (Helena) Louisa Ribaut, stepdaughter of Johannes Matthias Ross, the head of the Dutch factory at Kasimbazar when Halhed was stationed there. The betrothal probably took place in 1775. Association with Warren Hastings When Hastings then nominated him for the post of Commissary General in October 1776, however, there was serious resistance, and Halhed found his position untenable. Leaving Bengal, Halhed went to Holland, and on to London. Financial reasons forced him to consider a return to India, but he tried to do so without overt support from Hastings. On 18 November 1783 he asked the Company's directors to appoint him to the committee of Revenue in Calcutta. He was successful, but not in dissociating himself from Hastings. He returned to India as a reputed Englishman with a wife and black servant, but when he reached Calcutta, Hastings was in Lucknow. Halhed presented his credentials to Edward Wheler, the acting governor-general, but there was no vacancy in the committee and no other appointments could be made without Hastings. Then summoned by Hastings to Lucknow, he made a futile journey there, since Hastings had by then decided to leave for England and was bound for Calcutta. Hastings was planning to bring supporters to England, and wanted to have Halhed there as an agent of the Nawab Wazir of Oudh. At this point Halhed threw in his lot with Hastings. Support for Hastings and Brothers Halhed therefore returned to England, on 18 June 1785, identified as a close supporter of Hastings. The political context was the rise in 1780‚Äì4 of the \\"Bengal Squad\\", so-called.C. H. Philips, The East India Company \\"Interest\\" and the English Government, 1783‚Äì4: (The Alexander Prize Essay), Transactions of the Royal Historical Society Vol. 20 (1937), pp. 83‚Äì101, at p. 90; Published by: Cambridge University Press on behalf of the Royal Historical Society. DOI: 10.2307/3678594 The \\"Bengal Squad\\" was, in the first place, a group of Members of Parliament. They looked out for the interests of East India Company officials who had returned to Great Britain. From that position, they became defenders of the Company itself. The group that followed Hastings to England consisted of: Halhed, David Anderson, Major William Sands, Colonel Sweeney Toone, Dr. Clement Francis, Captain Jonathan Scott, John Shore, Lieutenant Col. William Popham, and Sir John D'Oyly. This group is called by Rosane Rocher the \\"Hastings squad\\" or \\"Bengal squad\\". That follows the contemporary practice of identifying the \\"Squad\\" or \\"the East Indians\\" with the backers of Hastings. Edmund Burke brought 22 charges against Hastings in April 1786, and Halhed was in the middle of the defence. For the Benares charge, Halhed had drafted a reply for Scott, but it was not in accord with Hastings's chosen line. He also cast doubt on some of Hastings's account when he was called on to testify. As a result, Halhed became unpopular with the defence team. Halhed began to look for a parliamentary career: his choice of enemies made him a Tory. His first candidature, at in 1790, failed and cost him a great deal. He succeeded in acquiring a seat in May 1791 at the borough of Lymington, in Hampshire. His life was changed in 1795 by Richard Brothers and his prophecies. A revealed knowledge of the Prophecies and Times appealed to Halhed and resonated with the style of antique Hindu texts. He petitioned for Brothers in parliament when he was arrested for criminal lunacy. Unsuccessful, he damaged his own reputation. Life of seclusion and after The turn of the century saw Halhed a recluse, as he was for 12 years in all. He wrote on orientalist topics, but published nothing. From 1804 he was a follower of Joanna Southcott. In poverty, he applied for one of the newly opened civil secretary posts at the East India company, and was appointed in 1809. With access to the Company Library, Halhed spent time in 1810 translating a collection of Tipu Sultan's dreams written in the prince's own hand. He also made translations of the Mahabharata as a personal study, fragmentary in nature, and made to \\"understand the grand scheme of the universe\\". The old \\"Hastings squad\\" had become marginal after the trial, but Hastings was called to testify as an expert on Indian affairs in 1813. He died on 22 August 1818. Halhed wrote two poems, and was also given the responsibility of composing the epitaph. In spring 1819, Halhed declared his intention of resigning from the Company's services after ten years of service. He was allowed a ¬£500 salary, and recovered some of his early investments. Death Halhed lived on for another decade, without publishing anything further. His quiet life came to an end on 18 February 1830. He was buried in the family tomb of Petersham Parish Church. At his death his assets were estimated to be around ¬£18,000. Louisa Halhed lived for a year longer and died on 24 July 1831. Legacy Halhed's collection of Oriental manuscripts was purchased by the British Museum, and his unfinished translation of the Mahabharata went to the library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Works Halhed's major works are those he produced in Bengal, in the period 1772 to 1778. =A Code of Gentoo Laws= Just before Halhed was appointed as writer, the East India Company's court of directors notified the President and council at Fort William College of their decision to take over the local administration of civil justice: the implementation was left with the newly appointed Governor, Warren Hastings. Hastings assumed the governorship in April 1772 and by August submitted what was to become the Judicial Plan. It provided among other things that \\"all suits regarding the inheritance, marriage, caste and other religious usages, or institutions, the laws of the Koran with respect to Mohametans and those of the Shaster with respect to Gentoos shall be invariably adhered to.\\" No British personnel could read Sanskrit, however. Translation was undertaken and 11 pundits were hired to which an eleventh was added. Hastings envisaged making a text in English that contained the local laws. He intended to show the prudence of applying the Indian laws. The pundits worked to compile a text from multiple sources, the Vivadarnavasetu (sea of litigations). It was translated to Persian, via a Bengali oral version by Zaid ud-Din 'Ali Rasa'i. Halhed then translated the Persian text into English, working with Hastings himself. The completed translation was available on 27 March 1775. The East India Company had it printed in London in 1776 as A Code of Gentoo Laws, or, Ordinations of the Pundits. This was an internal edition, distributed by the East India Company. A pirate edition was printed by Donaldson the following year, followed by a second edition in 1781; translations in French and German appeared by 1778. The book made Halhed's reputation, but was controversial, given that the English translation was remote from its original. It failed to become the authoritative text of the Anglo-Indian judicial system. Its impact had more to do with Halhed's preface and the introduction to Sanskrit than the laws themselves. The Critical Review wrote in London, September 1777, that: Halhed in the preface stated that he had been \\"astonished to find the similitude of Shanscrit words with those of Persian and Arabic, and even of Latin and Greek: and these not in technical and metaphorical terms, which the mutation of refined arts and improved manner might have occasionally introduced; but in the main ground-work of language, in monosyllables, in the names of numbers, and the appellations of such things as would be first discriminated as the immediate dawn of civilisation.\\" This observation was shortly to be heralded as a major step towards the discovery of the Indo- European language family. =A Grammar of the Bengal Language= Scanning image of A Grammar of the Bengal Language, 1778. The East India Company lacked employees with good Bengali. Halhed proposed a Bengali translatorship to the Board of Trade, and set out a grammar of Bengali, the salaries of the pundits and the scribe who assisted him being paid by Hastings. Difficulty arose with a Bengali font. Charles Wilkins undertook it, the first Bengali press was set up at Hugli, and the work of creating the typeface was done by Panchanan Karmakar, under the supervision of Wilkins. The grammar was the property of the Company, Wilkins informed the council on 13 November 1778 that the printing was completed, by which time Halhed had left Bengal. Halhed's Grammar was widely believed at the time to be the first grammar of Bengali, because the Portuguese work of Manuel da Assump√ß√£o, published in Lisbon in 1743, was largely forgotten. =Other works= Halhed's early collaboration with Richard Brinsley Sheridan was not an overall success, though they laboured on works including Crazy Tales and the farce Ixiom, later referred to as Jupiter, which was not performed. Halhed left for India. One work, The Love Epistles of Aristaenetus. Translated from the Greek into English Metre, written by Halhed, revised by Sheridan and published anonymously, did make a brief stir. The friendship came to an end, Elizabeth Linley chose Sheridan over Halhed, and later they were political enemies. The opening of the Calcutta Theatre in November 1773 gave Halhed occasion to write prologues. A production of King Lear also spurred him to write more pieces. He produced humorous verse: A Lady's Farewell to Calcutta, was a lament for those who regretted staying in the mofussil. Halhed wrote an anonymous tract in 1779 in defense of Hastings's policies with respect to the Maratha War. He began to write poetry, also, expressing his admiration for the governor, such as a Horatian ode of 1782. Under the pseudonym of \\"Detector\\" he wrote a series of open letters that appeared in newspapers, as separate pamphlets and in collections. These letters span over a year, from October 1782 to November 1783. In the decade of Hastings's impeachment, Halhed remained involved in the war of pamphlets. The Upanisad (1787) was based on Dara Shikoh's Persian translation.

It is also referred to by its full name, the Orion‚ÄìCygnus Arm, as well as Local Arm, Orion Bridge, and formerly, the Local Spur and Orion Spur. Sinai, Egypt The arm is named for the Orion Constellation, which is one of the most prominent constellations of Northern Hemisphere winter (Southern Hemisphere summer). Some of the brightest stars and most famous celestial objects of the constellation (e.g. Betelgeuse, Rigel, the three stars of Orion's Belt, the Orion Nebula) are within it as shown on the interactive map below. The arm is between the Carina‚ÄìSagittarius Arm (the local portions of which are toward the Galactic Center) and the Perseus Arm (the local portion of which is the main outer-most arm and one of two major arms of the galaxy). Long thought to be a minor structure, namely a \\"spur\\" between the two arms mentioned, evidence was presented in mid 2013 that the Orion Arm might be a branch of the Perseus Arm, or possibly an independent arm segment.Earth's Milky Way Neighborhood Gets More Respect, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Dave Finley, 3 June 2013 Within the arm, the Solar System is close to its inner rim, in a relative cavity in the arm's Interstellar Medium known as the Local Bubble, about halfway along the arm's length, approximately from the Galactic Center.

Illustration by Gerhard Munthe. Gudr√∏d the Hunter (Old Norse: Gu√∞r√∏√∞r vei√∞ikonungr, Norwegian: Gudr√∏d Veidekonge, literally Gudrod Hunter-king), also known as Gudr√∏d the Magnificent (Old Norse: enn g«´fugl√°ti, Norwegian: den gjeve), is a legendary character portrayed in the Norse sagas as a Norwegian petty king in the early 9th century. According to the sagas, he was the father of Halfdan the Black, and thus the grandfather of Harald Fairhair, the first king of unified Norway. He is considered by modern historians to be of a more mythical nature than other ancestors of Harald and Halfdan, and he can not be identified historically. Historians have in turn made a number of proposals seeking to identify him with various would-be contemporary historical figures. Background Viken), showing locations mentioned in the article. Gudr√∏d was a member of the House of Yngling. He was the son of Halfdan the Mild, king of Romerike and Vestfold, and Liv, daughter of King Dag of Vestmar. Gudr√∏d is mentioned in the skaldic poem Ynglingatal, and Snorri Sturluson elaborates on Gudr√∏d's story in Heimskringla. According to Snorri, Gudr√∏d was called both \\"the Magnificent\\" and \\"the Hunter\\", while Ynglingatal only refers to him as \\"the Magnificent\\". Legend While Gudr√∏d is portrayed as a king in Oppland in some older texts, Snorri writes that he was a king in Vestfold. Gudr√∏d first married Alfhild, a daughter of Alfarin, king of Alfheim (now Bohusl√§n). Gudr√∏d inherited half the province of Vingulmark. They had a son, Olaf Geirstad-Alf. When Alfhild died, Gudr√∏d sent his men to the king of Agder, Harald Granraude, to propose a marriage with his daughter √Ösa. When Harald declined, Gudr√∏d decided to take √Ösa by force. They arrived at night. When Harald realised that he was being attacked, he assembled his men and fought well, but died together with his son Gyrd. Gudr√∏d thereafter captured √Ösa and married her. They had the son Halfdan the Black. In the fall, when Halfdan was a year old, Gudr√∏d was having at a feast in an otherwise unknown location called \\"Stivlesund\\". He was very drunk and in the evening, as he was walking on the gangway to leave the ship, an assassin thrust a spear through Gudr√∏d, killing him. Gudr√∏d's men instantly killed the assassin, who turned out to be √Ösa's page-boy. √Ösa admitted that the page-boy had acted on her behalf. After Gudr√∏d was killed, √Ösa took the 1 year-old Halfdan and returned to Agder, where Halfdan was raised. Ancestry References Other sources *Krag, C.

Comilla is bordered by Brahmanbaria and Narayanganj districts to the north, Noakhali and Feni districts to the south, Tripura of India to the east and Munshiganj and Chandpur districts to the west. Comilla district is located in the south eastern part of Bangladesh. History World War II cemetery in Mainamati. The present Comilla is a district under the Chittagong Division. It was once under ancient Samatata and later became part of the state of Tripura. As far as is known from the ancient archeology found in the region, Gupta emperors ruled the Tripura since the fifth century AD. According to historians, Buddhist Deva dynasty ruled the region from the seventh to the middle of the eighth century. In the ninth century, Comilla came under the control of the kings of Harikela and then ruled by the Chandra dynasty during tenth and mid eleventh century AD. Later on it was ruled by the Mughals and then it came under the rule of East India Company in 1765. In order to facilitate revenue collection, the company hired a district collector in the province in 1769. Comilla then belonged to the province of Dhaka. Comilla was made under the office of the district collector in 1776. The Tripura Collector's journey began with the formation of Tippera or Tipperah district of Bengal by the British in 1790. According to the Third Regulation in 1793, a civil judge was appointed for the Tripura district and in that year he was given magisterial powers. In 1837, the posts of magistrate and collector were separated. In 1859, these two posts were merged again. After the partition in 1947, the district was renamed Comilla in 1960 and the post of district magistrate and collector was named deputy commissioner. Chandpur and Brahmanbaria sub- divisions of this district were transformed into districts in 1984. Geography and climate Comilla has a total area of 3085.17 square kilometres. It is bounded by Burchiganj and Tripura on the north, Laksham and Chauddagram on the south, and Barura on the west. Major rivers passing through Comilla include the Gumti and the Little Feni. It is hot in summer and cold in winter. Administration The administrative headquarters of Comilla are located in the city of Comilla which has a total area of 11.47 square kilometres.

Conflict in this theatre began when the Empire of Japan invaded French Indochina in September 1940 and rose to a new level following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and simultaneous attacks on Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Malaya on 7 and 8 December 1941. The main landing at Singora (now Songkhla) on the east side of the Isthmus of Kra preceded the bombing of Pearl Harbor by several hours. Action in the theatre officially ended on 9 September 1945. Initial Japanese successes The Allies suffered many defeats in the first half of the war. Two major British warships, and were sunk by a Japanese air attack off Malaya on 10 December 1941. Following the invasion, the government of Thailand formally allied itself with Japan on 21 December. Japan invaded Hong Kong in the Battle of Hong Kong on 8 December, culminating in surrender on 25 December. January saw the invasions of Burma and the Dutch East Indies and the capture of Manila and Kuala Lumpur. =Malaya and Singapore= Japanese forces met stiff resistance from III Corps of the Indian Army, the Australian 8th Division and British units during the Battle of Malaya, but Japan's superiority in air power, tanks and infantry tactics drove the Allied units back. After being driven out of Malaya by the end of January 1942, Allied forces in Singapore, under the command of Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942; about 130,000 Allied troops became prisoners of war. The fall of Singapore was the largest surrender in British military history. =The Japanese Indian Ocean raid= The Japanese Indian Ocean raid was a naval sortie by the Fast Carrier Strike Force of the Imperial Japanese Navy from 31 March to 10 April 1942 against Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean. Following the destruction of the ABDACOM forces in the battles around Java in February and March, the Japanese sortied into the Indian Ocean to destroy British seapower there and support the invasion of Burma. The raid was only partially successful. It did not succeed in destroying Allied naval power in the Indian Ocean but it did force the British fleet to relocate from British Ceylon to Kilindini near Mombasa in Kenya, as their more forward fleet anchorages could not be adequately protected from Japanese attack. The fleet in the Indian Ocean was then gradually reduced to little more than a convoy escort force as other commitments called for the more powerful ships. From May 1942, it was also used in the invasion of Madagascar ‚Äî an operation aimed at thwarting any attempt by Japan to use bases on the Vichy French controlled territory. In 1942, Madras City was attacked by a Mitsubishi Rufe, (the Zero's seaplane version) operating from the carrier which dropped a single bomb near the St. George Fort.World War 2 Plus 55 .

The physical damage was negligible, though the public response was major and the city was evacuated because of fears of subsequent Japanese bombing and invasion. Many rich families from Madras moved permanently to the hill stations in fear. Also in 1942 in preparation for a possible Japanese invasion of India, the British began improvements to the Kodaikanal-Munnar Road to facilitate its use as an evacuation route from Kodaikanal along the southern crest of the Palani Hills to Top Station. Existing roads then continued to Munnar and down to Cochin where British ships would be available for evacuation out of India.G.Venkataraman, Radio Sai, Volume 4 ‚Äì Issue 07, Kodai, Some History And Geography (July 2006) =Japanese occupation of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands= The Andaman and Nicobar Islands (8,293 km¬≤ on 139 islands) are a group of islands situated in the Bay of Bengal at about 780 miles from Kolkata (known at the time as Calcutta), 740 miles from Chennai (known at the time as Madras) and 120 miles from Cape Nargis in Burma. On 23 March 1942 a Japanese invasion force seized the islands and occupied them until the end of the war. On 29 December 1943, political control of the islands was theoretically passed to the Azad Hind government of Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose visited Port Blair to raise the tricolour flag of the Indian National Army. After Bose's departure the Japanese remained in effective control of the Andamans, and the sovereignty of the Arzi Hukumat-e Hind was largely fictional.C. A. Bayly & T. Harper Forgotten Armies.

Indian Ocean naval campaigns 1942‚Äì45 The earliest successes were gained by mine laying and submarine warfare. The Japanese minesweeping capability was never great, and when confronted with new types of mines they did not adapt quickly. Japanese shipping was driven from the Burmese coast using this type of warfare. British submarines based in British Ceylon operated against Japanese shipping. It was only after the war in Europe was clearly coming to an end that large British forces were dispatched to the Indian Ocean again. Following the neutralisation of the German fleet in late 1943 and early 1944, forces from the Home Fleet were released, and the success of Operation Overlord in June meant even more craft could be sent, including precious amphibious assault shipping. During late 1944, as more British aircraft carriers came into the area a series of strikes were flown against oil targets in Sumatra, such as Operation Meridian. was lent for the first attack by the United States. The oil installations were heavily damaged by the attacks, aggravating the Japanese fuel shortages due to the American blockade. The final attack was flown as the carriers were heading for Sydney to become the British Pacific Fleet. After the departure of the main battle forces the Indian Ocean was left with escort carriers and older battleships as the mainstay of its naval forces. Nevertheless, during those months important operations were launched in the recapture of Burma, including landings on Ramree and Akyab and near Rangoon. Command structures =Allied command structure= At the start of the war the British had two commands with responsibilities for possessions in the theatre. India Command under General Sir Archibald Wavell the Commander-in-Chief (CinC) of the Army of India and the Far East Command, first under Air Chief Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham and then from 23 December 1941 commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Royds Pownall. India Command was responsible for British India, British Ceylon, and for some of the time Burma. The Far East Command based in Singapore was responsible for Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore and other British Far East possessions including, for some of the time, Burma. A month after the outbreak of war with Japan on 7 December 1941, the Allied governments jointly appointed the British Commander-in-Chief (CinC) of the Army of India, General Sir Archibald Wavell, as Supreme Allied Commander of all \\"American-British- Dutch-Australian\\" (ABDA) forces in South East Asia and the Pacific, from Burma to the Dutch East Indies. However, advances made by the Japanese over the next month split the ABDA forces in two. After transferring the forces in Burma to the India Command, on 25 February 1942 Wavell resigned as commander of the ABDA and resumed his position of CinC of the Army of India. Responsibility for the South West Pacific Area passed to US General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific. From February 1942 until November 1943 the India Command was responsible for the South East Asian Theatre. General Wavell was made Viceroy of India and General Claude Auchinleck became Commander-in-Chief of the India Command on 20 June 1943. In August 1943 the Allies formed a new South East Asian Command to take over strategic responsibilities for the theatre. The reorganisation of the theatre command took about two months. On 4 October Winston Churchill appointed Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten supreme Allied commander of the South East Asia Command (SEAC). The American General Joseph Stilwell was the first deputy supreme Allied commander. On 15 November, Auchinleck handed over responsibility for the conduct of operations against the Japanese in the theatre to Mountbatten. The initial land forces operational area for SEAC included India, Burma, British Ceylon and Malaya. Operations were also mounted in Japanese-occupied Sumatra, Thailand and French Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos). Initially SEAC commanded: * British Eastern Fleet (based in Ceylon) * British 11th Army Group (Commonwealth land forces; HQ in New Delhi) * Air HQ India (New Delhi) * China Burma India Theater (CBI), (all US forces in theatre; HQ in New Delhi). In October 1944, CBI was split into US Forces China Theater (USFCT) and India-Burma Theater (USFIBT). On 12 November 1944 Eleventh Army Group redesignated by Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA) combining Commonwealth and US forces, with an HQ at Kandy. On 1 December ALFSEA HQ moved to Barrackpore, India. On 15 August 1945 responsibility for the rest of the Dutch East Indies was transferred from the South West Pacific Area to SEAC. SEAC was disbanded on 30 November 1946. 11th Army Group British 11th Army Group ( November 1943 ‚Äì 12 November 1944) was on paper the main Commonwealth army force in South East Asia which directed * British Fourteenth Army * British Army in Ceylon (Ceylon Army) * Northern Combat Area Command under the command of Joseph Stilwell. On 12 November 1944 the 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia, still under SEAC, because it was felt that an inter-Allied command was better than the purely British headquarters. Command problems with General Stilwell and his interactions with the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff had precipitated the change. =Japanese command structure= The Imperial Japanese Army Unit controlling all army land and air units in South East Asia and the South West Pacific was the Southern Expeditionary Army headquartered in Saigon, Indochina. It was commanded by General Count Hisaichi Terauchi, who commanded it from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese also deployed the South Seas Force, a combined force of Army and Special Naval Landing Force personnel. The Southern Army's major field commands were the 14th Army, the 15th Army, the 16th Army and the 25th Army. These consisted of 11 infantry divisions, six independent infantry brigades, and six tank regiments, plus artillery and support troops. The Japanese extensively used bicycle infantry, which allowed them quick movement over vast distances.

Biography =Life= Brothers was born in Port Kirwan, Newfoundland (earlier known as Admiral's Cove). He was educated in Woolwich, England. He entered the Royal Navy and served under Keppel and Rodney. In 1783, he became lieutenant, and was honourably discharged on 28 July 1783, receiving a pension which amounted to half-pay (54 pounds per year). He then travelled on the continent of Europe and later married Elizabeth Hassall in 1786. His marriage was reported as being \\"unhappy\\" and so he returned to service in the Royal Navy. Because he came to believe that military service was not compatible with his new calling to serve Christianity, in 1789 he once again left the Navy. Built upon the principle of individual revelation, Brothers believed that he could not serve the King as head of the Church of England. In 1791, he began to question the oath he had been required to take for receipt of his military half-pay, and he found himself with little income as a result of his subsequent actions. Brothers then divided his time between the open air and the workhouse, where he developed the idea that he had a special divine commission. Brothers claimed to hear the voice of an attending angel which proclaimed to him the fall of Babylon the Great, which was in fact London. Apparently upon Brothers's plea for mercy, God decided to spare London for a time and the destruction was halted. Around this time, Brothers was also expectant of a heavenly lady who would descend from the clouds showering him with money, love and happiness. In February 1792 Brothers declared himself a healer and claimed he could restore sight to the blind. He drew large crowds, but not due to his healing ability as much as his small gifts of money to those he prayed for. =Works= A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophesies and Times, 1794, the most important work of Richard BrothersIn 1793 Brothers declared himself to be the apostle of a new religion. He began to see himself as possessing a special role in the gathering of the Jews back into Palestine, in particular, the \\"Jews\\" who were hidden amongst the population of Great Britain. In similarity to modern British Israelists, Brothers asserted that the \\"hidden Israel\\" had no notion of its biological lineage and that part of his role would be to teach them of their true identity and lead them to the land of Canaan. Brothers proclaimed himself to be Prince of the Hebrews, literal descendant of the Biblical House of David, and the Nephew of the Almighty, who would rule over Israel until the return of Jesus Christ. Brothers declared he would achieve all this using a rod he had fashioned from a wild rosebush, with which he would perform miracles, as Moses had done. All this was declared in the first British Israelist publication in 1794: > A REVEALED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPHECIES AND TIMES, Book the First, wrote > [sic] under the direction of the LORD GOD and published by His Sacred > Command, it being the first sign of Warning for the benefit of All Nations; > Containing with other great and remarkable things not revealed to any other > Person on Earth, the Restoration of the Hebrews to Jerusalem by the year of > 1798 under their revealed Prince and Prophet (i.e., Richard Brothers). > London, Printed in the year of Christ 1794. Brothers began to attract quite a following, but due to his rejection of organisational work, and eccentric nature, he did not develop any sort of social movement. In consequence of prophesying the death of the King and the end of the monarchy, he was arrested for treason in 1795, and imprisoned on the grounds of being criminally insane. His case was, however, brought before Parliament by his ardent disciple, Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, an orientalist and a member of the House of Commons. As a result Brothers was removed to a private asylum in Islington. While he was in the private asylum Brothers wrote a variety of prophetic pamphlets which gained him many believers. Amongst his supporters was William Sharp, the engraver. Some of his political predictions (such as the violent death of Louis XVI) seemed to be proof that he was inspired. But when Brothers predicted that, on 19 November 1795 he would be revealed as Prince of the Hebrews and Ruler of the world, and the date passed without any such manifestation, Sharp deserted him to become a religious follower of Joanna Southcott. His followers tended to drift away either disillusioned or embarrassed. =Death= Brothers spent the last 30 years of his life designing the flags, uniforms, and palaces of the New Jerusalem. John Finlayson finally secured his release from the private asylum in 1806, and Brothers moved into his London home, where he died a lonely figure on 25 January 1824. Finlayson then began a financial campaign against the Government, seeking payment of an enormous claim for his maintenance of Richard Brothers prior to his death.

Origin, appearance, and abilities  Norby was originally a robot named the Searcher, created by the robot Mentor First on the planet Jamya. When the Mentor robots were in danger of deactivation due to exhausting their fuel, the Searcher was deployed in order to find a promised refueling ship sent by the Others, the creators of the Mentors. The small robot succeeded in locating the ship, however before he could warp it back to Jamya, it crashed in Earth's asteroid belt. The impact of the crash also rendered the Searcher immobile, until the ship was discovered many years later by a salvager and inventor named McGillicuddy. McGillicuddy was a robot maker himself, albeit his were of cruder design than the Mentors'. One of his damaged robots was created from a tubby barrel that originally contained Norb's Nails, later becoming the basis for Norby's name. McGillicuddy used the Searcher's parts to repair his damaged robot. Norby eventually fell into the possession of a used-robot shop where he was sold to Jefferson Wells, a space cadet looking for a teaching robot. Norby's body reflects his outer origins as a barrel, while his arms are retractable and have double-sided palms (and two thumbs). His head is round with four eyes, two on each side, and the top is a dome which he can retract into his barrel. His feet are also extendable/retractable. Norby has a tenor voice but can communicate through telepathy by touch. Norby is equipped with a miniature anti-gravity device allowing him to float. He also possesses the ability to travel through hyperspace, although his navigating abilities are sometimes unreliable. He also has the capability to travel through time via hyperspace. Norby's many features make him a target for scientists, the army, and the rogue Inventor's Guild who wish to disassemble and study him.  Heroic feats  In the first Norby book, Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot, Norby and his owner Jefferson Wells stop the villain Ing the Ingrate from taking over the Solar System. In the second book, Norby's Other Secret, Norby and Jeff travel to the planet Jamya to restore the mental health of Norby's creator, Mentor First. Along the way they learn about the Others, a race that bio-engineered the intelligent Jamyn dragons. The third book, Norby and the Lost Princess, introduces the planet Izz and its displaced human settlers. While Norby and company prepare for a singing contest, they go to Izz where they find out that Princess Rinda has taken the only Izzian hyperspace ship to Melodia. Norby, Jeff, Fargo, Yobo, and Albany go to the planet on a rescue mission only to be imprisoned by the native insect life. The fourth book, Norby and the Invaders, pits Norby and Jeff against a race of balloon-shaped aliens nicknamed the Invaders. The Invaders kidnap the Grand Dragon at the novel's outset and place her in an underwater zoo on their homeworld. An intelligent vine named the Dookoza attempts to thwart a rescue mission by Jeff and Norby, but they end up freeing the Grand Dragon and leaving the Dookoza on the planet Melodia. The fifth book, Norby and the Queen's Necklace sends Norby and Jeff to the French Revolution using the Queen's Necklace, a time travel device that also involved Marie Antoinette in a scandal. After escaping the Bastille, Norby and Jeff take a Frenchman named Marcel on a wild romp through time as they attempt try to find the origin of the device. Jeff meets a council of the Others in this book. The sixth book, Norby Finds a Villain introduces the character of Threezey the Clown, the alter ego of Ing. In this book, Ing/Threezey kidnaps Pera at a magic show and tries to use her to create a superbomb that will leave him as the only thing left in the universe. He instead opens a portal to another reality where the tree-like Master Cult (MC) rule, and accidentally bring them to the Solar System where they proceed to conquer Earth. In the seventh book, Norby Down to Earth, Norby learns about his origins as well as the fate of the spacer McGillicuddy, who converted him to his current form. The eighth book, Norby and Yobo's Great Adventure, finds Norby and Jeff stranded in ancient Africa with Admiral Yobo. The ninth book, Norby and the Oldest Dragon, takes place almost entirely on the planet Jamya, which is being menaced by an attack from an intelligent cloud. The dragon in the title refers to the Dowager Dragon, mother of the Grand Dragon (the current ruler of Jamya). The tenth book, Norby and the Court Jester, is set once more on the planet Izz and brings back the villain Ing for a third appearance. The final book in the series, Norby and the Terrified Taxi, centers around Lizzie, an intelligent taxi first introduced in Norby Down to Earth. They must find and stop Garc the Great who wants to change history.  Recurring characters  *Jefferson \\"Jeff\\" Wells: A 14-year-old cadet in the Space Academy, Jeff is Norby's \\"owner\\" and partner. Jeff originally purchases Norby, with the help of a loan from Admiral Yobo, to learn Martian Swahili for a class (Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot). His brother Fargo serves as his guardian, as their parents died when Jeff was only 10. *Farley Gordon \\"Fargo\\" Wells: a secret agent for Admiral Boris Yobo of Space Command. Handsome, charming, musical, and a bit arrogant, he dates Albany Jones in the first book, and married her in later novels. Fargo is ten years older than Jeff and serves as his guardian. *Admiral Boris Yobo: Jeff's commanding officer and Fargo's boss, Yobo has a big appetite for adventure and a larger one for food. Yobo originally gave Jeff the money to buy Norby from a used robot shop. Due to his high rank in Space Command, Yobo tends to become a quasi-liaison to whatever world Norby takes him. *Albany Jones: A police officer and daughter of the Mayor of Manhattan. She fought Ing with the help of other police officers in the first novel and eventually marries Fargo. *Zargl: A dragon from Jamya, Zargl is the great-niece of the Grand Dragon. Zargl, along with her mother Zi, are the very first dragons Jeff and Norby meet on their first trip to Jamya (Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot). Zargl has joined Jeff and Norby and some of their adventures outside of Jamya as well (particularly in Norby and the Lost Princess). *Mentor First: An ancient Jamyn robot with three eyes and four arms, Mentor First constructed Norby as a way to contact his creators, the \\"Others,\\" for supplies (Norby's Other Secret). Mentor First went insane for a long time, out of loneliness, worry, and lack of the ability to refuel, but eventually returned to full health thanks to Norby and Jeff. Norby refers to Mentor First as \\"Father.\\" *Rembrandt: A four armed, three eyed \\"Other\\" living in present time (Norby and Jeff have also met Others in the past and future), Rembrandt studies and creates visual art. He lives on a museum ship run by the computer Y.I.B., which stands for Your Immense Brain, a nickname Norby gave her. Jeff calls him Rembrandt, after the famed Renaissance artist, as his real name is unpronounceable to humans (Norby Finds a Villain). *Rinda: The 11-year-old Crown Princess of Izz (a planet colonized by humans taken from Earth by the Others). Rinda used her royal influence to board Izz's first hyperspace ship and accidentally hit a button which took it to a planet she termed Melodia. The music-loving alien inhabitants of this planet fed Rinda to a sacred tree; she became part of the tree for a while but was later restored to her human self (Norby and the Lost Princess). She has a crush on Jeff. *Pera: A robot similar to Norby, Pera was initially created by the Others to monitor the formation of the planet Melodia (Norby and the Lost Princess). Though Pera was intended to be crushed as Melodia formed, Norby and Jeff attempted to rescue her by taking her into hyperspace (due to an electronic field around the planet, Pera instead held onto her recording device as it went into hyperspace, saving Norby and Jeff instead). Pera stayed with Rinda on Izz as a companion. When she was kidnapped by Threezy/Ing, she opened an inter- dimensional portal allowing the Master Cult to take over the universe (Norby Finds a Villain). Pera is extremely observant and must always tell the truth. *The Grand Dragon: The ruler of Jamya, the Grand Dragon is large, regal and loves nothing more to be praised. *Lizzie: A floating, talking, and thinking taxicab who takes Norby and friends around Manhattan (Norby Down to Earth; Norby and the Terrified Taxi). Her circuits were adjusted by McGillicuddy, so she shares some origins with Norby. *Oola: Jeff's all-purpose pet (Norby's Other Secret). She is green and normally looks like a cat but has the ability to shape-shift to fit the desires of those near her. Her species was bio- engineered by Mentor First. Oola is vegetarian. *Ing/Threezy: The first villain of the series, Ing tries to take control of the Solar System with his band of Ingrates in Norby, the Mixed-Up Robot. After Norby stops his initial attempt, he later resurfaces as Threezy the Clown, intent on setting off a bomb in hyperspace and destroying the universe (Norby Finds a Villain). He ends up as Court Jester on the planet Izz (Norby and the Court Jester). Miscellany It has been speculated that Norby was named by his authors after Norbert Wiener, the \\"Father of Cybernetics\\". Note that in \\"Norby and the Lost Princess\\", King Fizzwell talks about a Spacecraft Challenger Disaster, more than one year before the real disaster occurred.

Life and work Sharp was the son of a reputable gunsmith who lived at Haydon's Yard, Minories in central London. He was apprenticed to the bright-cut engraverBright engraving (or Bright-cut engraving) is non-print engraving, such as on silver spoons, teapots, musical instruments etc. (See Art Union Journal, Oct 1839; and Cunningham, Lives etc, 1838, p277). and genealogist, Barak Longmate (1738‚Äì93), and after marriage, to a Frenchwoman, set himself up as a writing engraver in Bartholomew Lane (off Threadneedle Street). His first notable work was an engraving of \\"Hector\\", an old lion at the Tower of London. Around 1782, he sold the shop and moved to Vauxhall, intending to specialise in the higher branches (i.e. engraving for printing) of the engraver's art. Among his earlier plates are some illustrations, after Stothard, for the Novelists' Magazine. He also completed the plate of Benjamin West's \\"Landing of Charles II\\" which William Woollett had left unfinished at the time of his death, engraved some of the illustrations by artists who travelled with Captain Cook on his famous voyages,The voyages of Captain Cook (Davidson Galleries21 Feb 2011). and J. H. Benwell's \\"Children in the Wood\\".The children in the wood (engraving by Sharp after Benwell - Grosvenor Prints). He finally settled at Chiswick where he remained for the rest of his life. He engraved the \\"Doctors Disputing on the Immaculateness of the Virgin\\" and \\"Ecce Homo\\" (after Guido Reni); \\"King Lear in the Storm\\" and \\"The Witch of Endor (after Benjaimin West); \\"The sortie from Gibralter\\" (after John Trumbull); the portrait of John Hunter and \\"The Holy Family (after Joshua Reynolds); \\"St Cecilia\\" (after Domenichino) and \\"Virgin and Child\\" (after Dolci). Sharp's style of engraving was original, the half- tints rich and full. He became an honorary member of the Imperial Academy in Vienna and the Royal Academy in Munich. Sharp's portrait was painted by George Francis Joseph (1764‚Äì1846) and engraved by Sharp himself, and a 3/4-length portrait was painted by James Lonsdale (illustrated). James Thomson (1788‚Äì1850) engraved another portrait. Sharp died at Chiswick on 25 July 1824, and was buried in the parish churchyard there. Politics and religion Sharpe was a republican and a friend of Thomas Paine and Horne Tooke, and became a member of the Society for Constitutional Information. As a result of a legal dispute involving Horne Tooke, Sharp was questioned by the Privy Council on charges relating to treason, but was eventually dismissed without punishment as merely an \\"enthusiast\\". He became a convert to the teachings of Mesmer and Swedenborg and came under the religious influence of would-be visionary Jacob Bryan (who worked for Sharp as a printer for a time), and millennialist prophet Richard Brothers, engraving the latter as \\"Prince of the Hebrews\\". After Brothers' incarceration in an insane asylum in Islington, Sharp became an adherent of prophetess Joanna Southcott, whom he brought from Exeter to London and kept at his own expense for a considerable time; he made a portrait drawing of her which he engraved.Portrait of Joanna Southcott.

As the sport is global, the culture of the game is diverse, with varying degrees of overlap and distinctiveness in each country. In many countries, football has ingrained itself into the national culture, and parts of life may revolve around it. Many countries have daily football newspapers, as well as football magazines. Football players, especially in the top levels of the game, have become role models. Football has over 150 years of history ‚Äì with the rules first written in England in 1863 ‚Äì and since then a vast and diverse culture has emerged. The culture of football can be easily divided into how the players, fans and clubs see the sport. Held every four years, the FIFA World Cup is a \\"month long festival of football\\", with The Independent adding \\"its extreme popularity across the expanse of the globe giving it a uniquely universal audience\\". Fans =Fair Play = Fair Play is the name of a FIFA programme which aims to increase sportsmanship as well as prevent discrimination in the game of football. This also involves programmes to reduce racism in the game. The programme extends to outside of football, in trying to support charities and other organisations which improve conditions around the world. The principles of the Fair Play programme can be summarised as follows:FIFA.com ‚Äì \\"FIFA Fair Play Code\\" # Play fair (no diving) # Play to win but accept defeat with dignity # Observe the laws of the game # Respect opponents, teammates, referees, officials and spectators # Promote the interests of football # Honour those who defend football‚Äôs good reputation # Reject corruption, drugs, racism, sexism, violence, gambling and other dangers to our sport # Help others to resist corrupting pressures # Denounce those who attempt to discredit the sport # Use football to make a better world Both FIFA and UEFA have awards which they hand out to individuals or groups of people who have promoted what they see as the spirit of Fair Play, both within and outside of football. An example of this was the Italian player Paolo Di Canio who, while not given an award, was congratulated by many sections of the football world for a generous display of Fair Play. Despite having a goal- scoring opportunity while playing for West Ham United against Everton, when Di Canio saw the Everton goalkeeper had incurred an injury, instead of scoring what would have been the easiest goal of his career, he caught the crossed ball with his hands, causing the referee to call a foul for hand ball. The referee stopped play and allowed the goalkeeper to receive treatment for the cuts and bruises to his face. The referee smiled and did not issue a red card, which he should have done according to the laws of the game. When the referee noticed he was being shown close-up on the scoreboard screen, he pointed at his smile and began blowing loudly on his whistle. =Food and beverages= Brazilian supporters in Berlin drinking beer In the United Kingdom, attendance at football matches is associated with the consumption of traditional football foods such as meat pies and Bovril. Food and beverage sales in stadiums can raise high incomes for clubs, and some clubs make attempts to improve their service and diversify out of traditional foods. In Brazil, sandu√≠che de calabresa (pepperoni sandwich) is a popular meal in the surrounding areas of stadiums. In Mineir√£o stadium, feij√£o tropeiro, a typical dish from Minas Gerais, is very common. In Germany, many football fans eat bratwurst and drink beers. In Argentina, chorip√°n (a sandwich with grilled chorizo with crusty bread) and grilled hamburgers are commonly served in stadiums. In the past, a variety of pizza without cheese was served, which is now known as pizza de cancha (\\"pitch pizza\\"). In Spain, it is very common to eat sunflower seeds during the match. Although not in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but especially in Sarajevo, ƒáevapi are commonly seen to be sold around the stadiums before and after the matches, and people can often be seen selling pepita and juices in front of the entrance of the stadium and on the stands during the match. In many countries with drinking culture, football has been associated with alcohol consumption.Pearson, G. 'An Ethnography of English Football Fans: Cans, Cops and Carnivals', 2012, Manchester University Press This can be before, during and after the match, with drinking occurring inside the stadium, sometimes illicitly, as well as in pubs and bars outside. However, unwanted behaviour caused by drinking has led to the banning of the sale of alcohol to general supporters in stadiums across the UK, although most English and Welsh sides continue to sell alcohol within general stadium areas, with only clubs in Scotland being subject to a blanket ban following rioting after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final. Sales of alcohol still occur in executive lounges. Some teams and countries have Supporters Clubs which have friendly drinking reputations. However, some countries are more associated with drunken hooliganism as mentioned in the violence section below. More recently research has cast doubt on the effectiveness of alcohol restrictions on reducing the likelihood of disorder and violence, particularly involving English football fans see: Heysel Stadium disaster.Pearson, G. and Sale, A. 'On the Lash: Revisiting the Effectiveness of Alcohol Controls at Football Matches', Policing and Society, Vol. 21, No. 1, 2011: 1‚Äì17. =Hooliganism = Supporters of AFC Ajax The level of passion with which football teams are supported has from time to time caused problems, and clashes between fans can result in violence. Some violence occurs by people aiming to cause trouble, a phenomenon known as hooliganism. Other fans group together in hooligan firms, which are organised gangs that seek fights with other firms supporting rival clubs. Both are sometimes known as the \\"English Disease,\\" after the disorder caused by English fans travelling abroad to support either their club or national team in the 1970s and 1980s.Stott, C. and Pearson, G. 'Football Hooliganism: Policing and the War on the English Disease', 2007 London: Pennant Books However, violent organised supporters' groups surrounding football has been prevalent throughout other countries, most notably barras bravas that emerged in Argentina in the 1950s, some years before the appearance of significant hooligan firms in England. In addition ultras, origionally emerging in Italy in the 1960s, and in parts of Europe, Asia, Australia and North Africa; and torcidas organizadas in Brazil (emerged as non-violent groups during the 1930s but became violent ones in the 1970s) have become significant. Violence by fans has ranged from small fights between fans to tragedies such as the Heysel Stadium disaster and also the Football War. There have been incidents of fans being murdered, such as the killings of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, two Leeds United supporters, in Istanbul in 2000 on the eve of the UEFA Cup Semi-Final first leg. In recent years this aspect of the game seems to have passed its peak in England though it has by no means disappeared completely. Specialist police units and information- sharing between regional and international police forces has made it much harder for the hooligans to organise and participate in disorder. CCTV inside and outside stadiums and also at other anticipated \\"flash points\\" such as city centres and railway stations now makes it more likely that people involved in disorder can be identified later even if they are not arrested at the scene. However, there are still disruptions surrounding football matches. One example being the UEFA Champions League matches which were played on 12 and 13 March 2005. Violence by fans has also affected players, including professional athletes, but this is rare. One example includes a message to Christian Vieri, apparently by an Inter Milan fan, which threatened to burn down his restaurant, criticising his attitude towards the team. There is also the notorious incident where the Colombian international player Andr√©s Escobar was murdered shortly after returning home from the 1994 World Cup. This was reputedly for scoring the own goal which eliminated Colombia from the competition. Before the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 26 Seaburn Casuals (a Sunderland A.F.C. supporters firm) hooligans were arrested in a police raid after a military-issue smoke bomb was let out at a local pub after a fight with bouncers. By the end of the operation, over 60 were facing charges. Some of the Seaburn Casuals hooligans picked up in the raid were also involved with neo-Nazi groups like Combat 18. The operation failed when judge ruled CCTV footage from the pub inadmissible. In March 2002, the Seaburn Casuals fought with hooligans from the Newcastle Gremlins in a pre-arranged clash near the North Shields Ferry terminal, in what was described as \\"some of the worst football related fighting ever witnessed in the United Kingdom\\". The leaders of the Gremlins and Casuals were both jailed for four years for conspiracy, with 28 others jailed for various terms, based on evidence gained after police examined the messages sent by mobile phone between the gang members on the day. There have been a number of accidents and disasters in the history of football. Some of these, such as the Hillsborough and Ibrox disasters, were due to problems with crowd control. The Heysel Stadium disaster was a combination of hooliganism and poor crowd control. The Bradford City stadium fire was due to poor fire safety in the stadium. Lessons learned from these disasters have led to safer football stadiums. =Match programmes= Match programmes are sold inside and outside stadiums before, and sometimes during, matches. In their most simple form, they provide basic information on the teams, players, and match officials. Larger clubs usually produce multiple- page programmes with features such as comments from the manager and club captain, interviews with players, ex-players and backroom staff, information about ticketing arrangements for forthcoming matches, a detailed fixture list and review of the team's season so far, competitions, pages for junior fans, and a detailed feature on the opposition. Programmes from some matches are collectible items, and can fetch money at an auction. =Pitch invasions= West Bromwich Albion invade the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the \\"Great Escape\\" of avoiding relegation on the last day of the 2004‚Äì05 season. French football fans in Nice - 15.07.2018 Pitch invasions happen when supporters move from the stands onto the football pitch, some times to deliberately disrupt a match. This is distinguished from times when, due to safety reasons, fans are let onto the pitch. Examples of pitch invasions include the 1923 \\"White Horse\\" FA Cup final between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United at Wembley Stadium. Due to the overwhelming numbers in the stadium, the police had to bring order back to the stadium. Another example is the 1977 British Home Championship match between England and Scotland, again at Wembley. After Scotland won 2‚Äì1, the \\"Tartan Army\\" invaded the pitch and managed to break down the goalposts, as well as cutting up the turf to take.BBC Scotland (RealVideo) In addition, there are better natured pitch invasions, typically at the end of games that involve success for one of the teams. This commonly occurs after a team wins a championship, survives relegation or achieves an upset, typically in a cup competition. Solo invasions are more common although few in number. In some cases, these are streakers who try to invade the pitch while nude. Supporters tend to view this as harmless fun. One such pitch invasion was at UEFA Euro 2004, in the final between Portugal and Greece, when \\"Jimmy Jump\\" ran onto the pitch to disrupt the match.worldcupweb.com ‚Äì \\"Anger over transfer behind final pitch invasion\\" Another well known invasion was carried out by Karl Power, who sneaked into Manchester United's team photograph before their UEFA Champions League match with Bayern Munich. His other stunts have involved the England national rugby union team and the British Grand Prix. =Supporter groups= There are many types of sub-cultures and types of groups centred around football. Casuals are interlinked with hooligan firms. Ultras are a primarily continental European phenomenon (emerging later in Asia, Australia and North Africa), while in South America, the barra bravas (oldest violent organised supporters' groups, emerged in the 1950s in Argentina) are common, with the exception of Brazil, where torcidas organizadas are more prevalent. =Rivalries= Catalan flag before a 2012 game against Real Madrid. El Cl√°sico is among the most watched annual sporting events.\\"Lionel Messi Reaches $50 Million-A-Year Deal With Barcelona\\". Forbes. Retrieved 1 October 2014 Derby matches, which are matches between two neighbouring rival clubs, are often fiercely competitive. Sometimes there are underlying political or sectarian tensions. The term often applies to matches between two teams from the same city or region, but it is sometimes used to refer to matches between big clubs from the same country. Derbies are usually treated as the most important matches by the fans, players and clubs, regardless of position in the league table, et cetera. The film Green Street embodies the spirit of derbies when one of the characters refers to the West Ham United‚ÄìMillwall rivalry as that of Israel against Palestine. Of course this film does focus on the mostly past era of hooliganism, however its depiction of matchday passion shows just how important derby day is to fans. When it comes to derbies, the culture of football thrives and shines in all its colours. How Soccer Explains the World is a perfect source into how derbies emerged and what they mean to the community. Players =Celebrities= Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi Such is the popularity of football that some players become better known for their 'off-the-pitch' activities. The celebrity status is such that advertisers and sports goods manufacturers hire them to sponsor their products. The Brazilian footballer Pel√© is such a player. He was so admired as a player during his time that he went on to become a UNICEF ambassador, as well as being a spokesman in advertisements for many different companies. He also spent some time in politics in Brazil. Brazilian striker Ronaldo was chosen as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme in 2000 as he had the highest global appeal among sportspeople. Former FIFA World Player of the Year and African Footballer of the Year George Weah secured most votes in the first round of the 2005 Liberian presidential election, but was defeated in the run- off ballot. He was elected President 12 years later. Hidetoshi Nakata (middle) became so famous as a footballer in Japan he also became a name in fashion Another football celebrity is the English footballer David Beckham. He has been perceived as a trend-setter in England due to a history of frequent hairstyle changes. He is also married to the former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, and his relationship difficulties were widely reported in the UK press in 2004 and 2005. Statues have been made of him, notably at a Buddhist temple as well as made out of chocolate. Beckham was for a long time an Armani model, famous for his underwear advertisements. In late 2009, Beckham was replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo as Armani's primary footballer/model. Nine of the top ten most followed sportspeople on Facebook are footballers, including the top six, Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Beckham, Neymar, Ronaldinho and Kak√°, with Cristiano also the most followed person.\\"Top 100 Facebook Fan Pages\\". Fanpagelist.com. Retrieved 24 October 2014. Cristiano, Messi and Neymar are the three most followed sportspeople on Instagram, and all 3 in the top 12 most followed people. Many other players have also become celebrities and are treated as heroes by the fans. Retired players, such as Gary Lineker, have become celebrities in their own right by working on television or radio. Even non-footballers who are connected to football have become famous through their association alone. For instance, after the 2002 World Cup, the head of the Korea Football Association decided to run for president of South Korea. =Goal celebration= Andrey Arshavin celebrating a goal with a 'heart' gesture In football, a goal celebration is the practice of celebrating the scoring of a goal. The celebration is normally performed by the goalscorer, and may involve his or her teammates, the manager or coaching staff and/or the supporters of the team. Whilst referring to the celebration of a goal in general, the term can also be applied to specific actions, such as a player removing his shirt or performing a somersault. Many unique goal celebrations have been immortalized, such as in a statue (Thierry Henry), advertisements (Ronaldo), postage stamps (Pel√©), magazine covers, or in video games: Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Lionel Messi among many others are featured in the FIFA series.\\"Fifa 14 celebrations: How to do Gareth Bale, Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi's signature moves\\". The Mirror. Retrieved 6 September 2014 =Deaths= There have been deaths of players on the pitch and dugouts. On 5 September 1931, Celtic goalkeeper John Thomson suffered a skull fracture when he collided with Rangers player Sam English during an Old Firm match. He was fatally injured and died later that day. On 10 September 1985, Scotland manager Jock Stein died of a heart attack as his team scored the equaliser against Wales which virtually secured qualification for the 1986 World Cup finals. He was aged 62. In 2003, Cameroon international player Marc-Vivien Fo√© collapsed during a FIFA Confederations Cup match against Colombia and was pronounced dead later that day. His death was attributed to previously undiagnosed heart problems. On 8 September 1990, York City's David Longhurst collapsed and died on the pitch during his team's match with Lincoln City. The match was abandoned and York City paid tribute to the player later by naming a stand in his honour at their Bootham Crescent ground. In 2004, the Hungarian international Mikl√≥s Feh√©r died from a heart attack while playing for Benfica against Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es. On 9 September 2006, Hinckley United player Matt Gadsby collapsed on the pitch and died during a Conference North match against Harrogate Town. Medical tests revealed he died from a heart condition known as Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy. On 25 August 2007, Sevilla player Antonio Puerta suffered a heart attack during Sevilla's first match of the season ‚Äì against Getafe ‚Äì while running back towards his own goal. Sevilla teammate Ivica Dragutinoviƒá and Sevilla medical staff subsequently rushed to his aid. He was admitted to hospital but died on 28 August, aged 22. Several players have also been struck by lightning while playing during sudden storms. On 29 December 2007, Motherwell captain Phil O'Donnell suffered from a suspected heart failure on the pitch in a match against Dundee United, as a result of which he died several hours later in hospital. At the end of that season, a tribute match was played in his honour between stars of the Motherwell team which won the Scottish FA Cup in 1991 and the Celtic team which won the League Championship in 1998, both of which O'Donnell starred for. Motherwell also named the main stand of their stadium in his honour. Other disasters have occurred away from stadia. Most notably, the Superga air disaster of 1949 in which the entire Torino squad perished. Other examples include the Munich air disaster which involved the 1958 Manchester United squad; the loss of the entire Zambia national team squad in an air crash in 1993; and a plane crash in 2016 that killed 71 passengers, including almost the entire Chapecoense first team squad.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world- latin-america-38142998 =Ethnicity= Belgium national football team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup People of different races have sometimes not been accepted as players in European football. This is changing at the start of the 21st century due to society change as well as campaigning on the part of the football authorities in different countries. UEFA and the European Union support the Football Against Racism in Europe (\\"FARE\\") project, which aims to stop racism. Many black players were not accepted initially into European football, even though the earliest black player was in 1881. However, in the 1970s onwards, players were increasingly accepted leading to a situation where many club and national teams have players of varying ethnicities. However, full acceptance in the bigger footballing nations did not occur until the 1990s, and racism still exists at some levels. Samuel Eto'o, for example, was once racially insulted by some Real Zaragoza fans at a match against Barcelona, and threatened to quit the game if they kept insulting him. The same occurred to then-Messina defender Marc Zoro in a match against Inter Milan. In some countries, such as England and Germany, there have been strong campaigns to remove racism and intolerance from football on the pitch and on the terraces. In other countries, despite visible problems, little action has been taken, such as Spain and Italy. =Female players= Women have been playing football as long as the game has existed. Their numbers, as both football players and fans, increased with the lifting of bans on women playing football and attending matches. The first FIFA Women's World Cup was held in 1991, and has drawn worldwide television interest. Football matches now tend to have increased numbers of women supporters at the match, as well as watching matches at home or in pubs and bars. In the United States, the Women's United Soccer Association League was formed in 2001 in response to growing interest in women's football around that country. The league collapsed in 2003, but grassroots football was not affected, and the league relaunched in 2009 as Women's Professional Soccer. That league would also play for only three years, folding after its 2011 season; the semi-pro WPSL Elite was established as a bridge to the current National Women's Soccer League, which has played since 2013. The semi-professional W-League continues to operate with 38 teams, as of 2006. Japan's women's league, the L. League is well supported. =Globalization= Mexico's fans at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia Egypt's fans at the FIFA World Cup in Russia For the best players, it means their services can be offered to clubs in a number of different countries and for compensation they have significant bargaining power in setting ‚Äì the top players can make salaries of millions in a year, in addition to whatever endorsements they receive. Teams have also benefited from this by being able to find a wider support base outside their traditional local areas. They can also scout for talent from a wider area. However, some European clubs have been accused of exploitation for doing this, as some African youngsters they have recruited for football teams have eventually been left with nothing after the team no longer requires their services. In the modern game, most clubs have multiple foreign players. This is especially evident in the English Premier League, where English players are outnumbered by their foreign counterparts. Some of football's leading authorities, including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, have argued this is detrimental to the game and an issue for supporters. Published academic research on this question (by David Ranc) seems to demonstrate the opposite. Many teams attempt to build a complete team with players with ball control, others with strength, others with speed and others with vision. Traditionally, these skillsets are associated with different regions: ball control is regarded as a South American trait, speed is typically associated with African players and strength is typically seen as the European way. Therefore, prominent clubs scout these regions heavily for rising talent and advise them to have a trial with the club. Football has become a global sport where spectators from around the world can enjoy many different leagues. It has created international rivalries as well as community rivalries, but at the same time, it has the power to bring communities together. The FIFA World Cup brings the world of football together for an entire month. Through triumph and defeat it is a modern example of nationalism fused with globalisation. In Franklin Foer's How Soccer Explains the World, he explains that national teams create a tribal sense of nationalism amongst fans. This nationalism is shown in wearing football shirts, scarves and flying flags to express pride. When tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, the African Cup of Nations and the UEFA European Championship bring in supporters from nations around the world, this national pride is a part of globalism. This complex system is all a part of the global community of football. Football brings players, fans, coaches and clubs together from every part of the world. A prime example of the unifying power of football is the African nation of Ghana. It gained independence from British imperial rule in 1957 and used football to unite the nation. \\"The Black Stars\\", as the national team became known as, hosted the first African Cup of Nations. Ghana has become one of the most passionate footballing nations in both Africa and the world, thanks to the unifying power of the sport. Coaches are also becoming sought after internationally. This extends to national team coaches, once being native to their country, being brought in from other countries. Examples include Brazilian legend Zico coaching Japan; Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson, a Swede who coached England; as well as Berti Vogts, a German who coached Scotland and Nigeria. Another German, Otto Rehhagel, is practically a national icon in Greece after leading its national team to a shock victory in UEFA Euro 2004, and shortly afterwards turning down an offer to coach Germany and remain coaching Greece. Dutch coach Guus Hiddink has a similar iconic status in South Korea after coaching its national team to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup, so much so that one of South Korea's World Cup stadiums was renamed in his honour shortly after the competition. The two most recent managers of the US women were born outside the country, although both had lived in the US for many years before becoming USWNT head coaches. Jill Ellis, who managed the USWNT to World Cup wins in 2015 and 2019, is a native of England who moved to the US with her family in her early teens, and current manager Vlatko Andonovski moved from North Macedonia to the US as a player in 2000 and has remained in the US ever since as a player and coach. =Role models= While many football players can be argued to be good role models, there have been headlines in the news regarding bad behaviour by footballers. Such is the influence of footballers, their activities tend to be reported widely in the media and also bring condemnation from the government of the countries in which they play. Shortly prior to UEFA Euro 1996, the English national team gained notoriety for the \\"Dentist's Chair\\" incident. Several English players, including Paul Gascoigne and Teddy Sheringham, were photographed in Hong Kong after being seen in a bar pouring beer down each other's throats while the person sat on a dentist's chair. Later in his life, Gascoigne struggled with alcohol and drug addiction and had to be hospitalised for overdose on several occasions. There have been incidents in England of players being accused of violence and misconduct off the pitch. Although on many occasions, players have been found not guilty, such cases are highly controversial. In 2001, two Leeds United players, Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer, appeared in court over the assault of a student outside a nightclub. Woodgate was found guilty of affray. In 2002, three players (two from Chelsea, John Terry and Jody Morris; and one from Wimbledon, Des Byrne) appeared in court on charges of affray. All were acquitted. On 20 May 2008, Joey Barton was sentenced to six months in jail after pleading guilty for his part in an assault in December 2007. Barton was captured on CCTV punching a man 20 times. In 2004, the Leicester City trio of Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie spent a week in prison after being accused of sexual assault while on a training break at the La Manga resort in Spain with their team. However, the case was dropped after forensic evidence showed the accusations to be baseless. Although the players accused were ultimately innocent, the scandal led to a media outcry about footballers and their behaviour, especially with regard to children who look up to them. Wayne Rooney was also attacked in the media for alleged visits to prostitutes in 2004, a claim he later admitted was true. Adrian Mutu admitted cocaine use after failing a drugs test, and Graham Stack was charged with rape but cleared in 2005. Lee Bowyer again made headlines in 2005 when he and Newcastle United teammate Kieron Dyer fought each other near the end of a Premier League match. Clubs Clubs have moved from amateur status to, in some cases, big commercial concerns. Players have also managed to increase their earnings massively during this change. =Seating= After the Hillsborough Disaster, the British government commissioned the Taylor Report which resulted in standing being banned from many stadiums, including every top league stadium. Groups such as Stand Up Sit Down are campaigning for its return. This is very different from the situation in British non-league football and other leagues around the world where it is common to see terracing (standing areas) making up some, or even all of the room for fans. =Corruption= Allegations of corruption in football have always been present. This level of corruption can vary from country to country, and can involve players, agents and clubs. In 1980, Italian sides Milan and Lazio were relegated to Serie B for match-fixing. The 2005‚Äì06 football season saw many corruption scandals. This included the 2005 Bundesliga scandal in Germany, with the refereeing scandals of Robert Hoyzer; and the Brazilian football match-fixing scandal involving Edilson Pereira de Carvalho. This was followed by the 2006 Serie A scandal (\\"Calciopoli\\") in Italy where five clubs were found guilty for interference in the referees work by their leaders and resulted in several top clubs being penalised (most notably, Juventus was relegated to Serie B for the 2006‚Äì07 season and lost many top players) and getting their own title stripped off from them and being rewarded to Inter Milan, who were runners-up; and Apito Dourado in Portugal, with Porto and Boavista involved. =Finance= In a 1997 address to the Oxford Union, then Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar described clubs' inability to manage the ever-increasing amounts of money in football as the \\"prune juice effect\\"; clubs expenditure continually outnumbering the profits coming from sponsorships and prize money. While most grassroot clubs and lower division league teams struggle to make ends meet, large clubs can make significant revenue. For example, sides such as Manchester United and Real Madrid are considered amongst the richest in the world, with a global support base.Business Insider - \\"The 20 richest football clubs\\" Chelsea has also undergone a transformation, purchasing a number of expensive football players after itself being purchased by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. In 2008, Manchester City became the richest club in the world after being bought-out by Emirati billionaire Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyanan. The catalyst for this change was the arrival of satellite television. Satellite TV companies paid massive sums for the rights to cover football matches, and in turn have recouped this investment from the many fans who are unable to catch the match in person. This benefits the \\"hardcore\\" and \\"casual\\" fan as they have more choice of which game they want to watch. While some clubs do well out of the increased money in football, other clubs can get into trouble trying to keep up. Leeds United attempted to do this by spending a lot of money and were successful for a few seasons. However, the debts became unmanageable, the successful players were sold off and the team were eventually relegated twice, first from the Premier League to the Championship, and then to League One. Not all clubs do well out of television money. Clubs in lower leagues receive less money for matches and, if promoted to higher leagues, can have trouble matching the spending power of bigger clubs. This leaves them more likely to be relegated again. Clubs from smaller countries also have problems with this issue. Due to their smaller population base they receive less money from television rights. This means they are comparative paupers compared to clubs from the bigger countries, and can lead to debt problems if they try to match spending in trans-national competitions. Some clubs have managed to buck the trend by training players through their youth academies, as well as making wise investments. Examples of these clubs include Porto and Ajax, although when these teams become successful, as in Porto's case winning the 2003‚Äì04 UEFA Champions League, the players tend to get sold-off due to financial pressures. Society Having successfully campaigned for South Africa to be granted host status of the 2010 World Cup, an emotional Nelson Mandela raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy.\\"Blatter presents Mandela with a special FIFA World Cup Trophy\\" . FIFA.com. Retrieved 5 December 2013 In many countries, football has ingrained itself into the national culture, and many parts of life revolve around it. While incarcerated in Robben Island prison, Nelson Mandela reflected on how playing football \\"made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in\\".\\"Nelson Mandela: How sport helped to transform a nation\\". BBC. Retrieved 6 December 2013 Many countries have daily football newspapers, as well as football magazines. The mood of regions and countries has been seen to be connected to football, especially during major tournaments where victory can bring happiness to the local community or country. Conversely defeat can lower spirits, and has been seen to be connected to mortality in the population. Withdrawal symptoms when the football season finished have also been reported. The economy can also be seen to be connected to major football tournaments, although the precise association is disputed. The terms \\"soccer mom\\" and \\"soccer dad\\", popularised in the United States, refer broadly to a demographic group of parents with school-age children playing football. =Arts, literature and film= The popularity of football has been reflected in the arts, books and films. Books have been written dealing with the culture, such as violence, surrounding football, as well as detailed histories of events or rivalries. Many clubs have one or more fanzines, one example being TOOFIF. Some consider that British football's image of a nasty working-class pursuit was changed into something far more respectable after Fever Pitch, a memoir by Nick Hornby about his life as an Arsenal fan, was published. The book also provided Hornby's big break. It was later adapted very loosely into a film. Numerous films have been made including Bend It Like Beckham, and The Football Factory, based on the book by John King, dealing with hooliganism and its relationship to socio-economic realities in England. In Germany, The Miracle of Bern (2003) revived the euphoria of the national team's victory in the 1954 World Cup and was a huge hit. One film that has a historical basis is Escape to Victory. The film was based on the true World War II story where a Dynamo Kyiv team, which defeated a German Luftwaffe team, was subsequently persecuted and some team members executed. The story has also been recounted in the book Dynamo by Andy Dougan. =Sticker albums and cards= Sticker trade in Brazil for Panini‚Äôs 2018 World Cup sticker album Usually collected by children, a sticker album is a book where a collector sticks in pictures of players from different teams in a certain league. There may also be stickers of the clubs' stadia, badges or team photos. The most widespread are those that have been produced by Panini worldwide. In 1970, Panini published its first FIFA World Cup sticker album for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. Initiating a craze for collecting and trading stickers, UK newspaper The Guardian states, \\"the tradition of swapping duplicate [World Cup] stickers was a playground fixture during the 1970s and 1980s\\". Under its Merlin brand, Topps has held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League since 1994, including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards. Launched in the 2007‚Äì08 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world. =Religion= \\"Religious\\" aspects of sporting events include: * ritual pre-match, match and post-match traditions, ritualised group responses to cues such as on-pitch events, etc. * group chanting, singing, dancing. * the widespread use of symbols: team colours and logos take on a special importance and insulting these symbols is a grievous insult, often punishable by violence. Wearing them marks the wearer as an adherent of a certain group and divides the world, almost cult-like, into \\"us\\" and \\"them\\". *idol-worship of heroes which is associated with relics: balls, shirts, numbers, etc. associated with players and events are highly valued. *pilgrimages: some fans will fly to another country to see a match live or travel in large groups to far-away places, caravaning, to see events. *deep emotional involvement, ecstatic participation which can go in various directions: cathartic, fun, violent, etc. Football and other such sports lack some aspects usually associated with religion, however: * There is, in football, only a hint of transcendence. The memory of some players might be \\"immortal\\" and some teams \\"legendary,\\" but there is little in the way of an idea or ideology that is found in religion. * There are no holy texts. There are famous sayings, but they do not carry authority for regulating belief or behaviour. * Prayers are common, but they are usually directed outside the system. Fans and players do not pray \\"to\\" football or \\"to\\" football heroes, but to the supernatural entities of other religions \\"about\\" football. * There are revered figures, but this is usually with a sense of irony. Owen Coyle was referred to as \\"God\\" by Burnley for example, because of his legendary role as a manager for the club, taking them from relegation favourites to the Premier League within 18 months of being appointed. However, in Burnley's Premier League season, Coyle left the club during the January transfer window for relegation rivals Bolton Wanderers, taking the majority of Burnley's backroom staff with him. Consequently, he is now widely referred to as \\"Judas\\" by Burnley fans. One of his first matches as Bolton manager was against his former club Burnley at the Reebok Stadium. During the match, several travelling Burnley fans displayed a banner which read, \\"He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\\", a reference to the Monty Python film Life of Brian. Religious beliefs are also in common use throughout football. Some players are religious and can be seen to cross themselves before a game. In Africa, traditional belief rituals are used to help teams win important games. In Argentina, an official religion around the footballer Diego Maradona has been formed called \\"Iglesia Maradoniana\\". German club Schalke 04 has brought out their own Bible titled Mit Gott auf Schalke (\\"With God in Schalke\\"). This is an edition of the common Christian Bible along with spiritual texts by Christian Schalke players and officials. =Health= In July 2014, the Seychelles Health department blocked the football team from Sierra Leone from coming in to play qualification match for the Africa Cup of Nations. This came at the cost of Seychelles forfeiting that match and Sierra Leone advancing. The Africa Cup of Nations is known as the biggest football tournament in Africa. Morocco asked to delay the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations due to Ebola, and then pulled out from hosting it entirely. Despite the scare, it held the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup. The Africa Cup of Nations is biennial 16-team football match for Africa. After this, the Confederation of African Football (\\"CAF\\") searched for a new host nation for the event. Equatorial Guinea took over as the new host for the event. Equatorial Guinea was previously barred from the competition, but was allowed back in after it became host, while Morocco, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea were banned from the competition.

In order to escape, Road Runner runs endlessly to the left. While avoiding Wile E. Coyote, the player must pick up bird seeds on the street, avoid obstacles like cars, and get through mazes. Sometimes Wile E. Coyote will just run after the Road Runner, but he occasionally uses tools like rockets, roller skates, and pogo-sticks. Development Originally, the game was going to use laserdisc technology for the backgrounds and road. When the player died in the game, one of many cartoon death sequences taken from the original shorts would have shown. The game was going to be released in 1984, but Atari decided to cancel the game. The game was eventually released in 1985, but this version was a modified version. The laserdisc cutscenes were taken out of the final game, and the road and backgrounds were changed to computer-generated graphics. The prototype cabinet was eventually found, and it is now playable at California Extreme. Ports Atari ST cover Road Runner was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari 2600, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, and Nintendo Entertainment System. The Atari 2600 port was one of Atari Corporation's last games for the system, being released in 1989. Like other NES games released by Tengen, Road Runner was unlicensed by Nintendo itself, released as an unlicensed cartridge rounding Nintendo's protections. Reception The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #140 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Exolon.

XPL was designed in 1967 as a way to teach compiler design principles and as starting point for students to build compilers for their own languages. XPL was designed and implemented by William M. McKeeman , David B. Wortman , James J. Horning and others at Stanford University. XPL was first announced at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference. The methods and compiler are described in detail in the 1971 textbook A Compiler Generator. They called the combined work a 'compiler generator'. But that implies little or no language- or target-specific programming is required to build a compiler for a new language or new target. A better label for XPL is a translator writing system. It helps to write a compiler with less new or changed programming code. Language The XPL language is a simple, small, efficient dialect of PL/I intended mainly for the task of writing compilers. The XPL language was also used for other purposes once it was available. XPL can be compiled easily to most modern machines by a simple compiler. Compiler internals can be written easily in XPL, and the code is easy to read. The PL/I language was designed by an IBM committee in 1964 as a comprehensive language replacing Fortran, COBOL, and ALGOL, and meeting all customer and internal needs. These ambitious goals made PL/I complex, hard to implement efficiently, and sometimes surprising when used. XPL is a small dialect of the full language. XPL has one added feature not found in PL/I: a STRING datatype with dynamic lengths. String values live in a separate text- only heap memory space with automatic garbage collection of stale values. Much of what a simple compiler does is manipulating input text and output byte streams, so this feature helps simplify XPL-based compilers. Components =XCOM= The XPL compiler, called XCOM, is a one-pass compiler using a table-driven parser and simple code generation techniques. Versions of XCOM exist for different machine architectures, using different hand-written code generation modules for those targets. The original target was IBM System/360, which is a proper subset of IBM System/370, IBM System/390 and IBM System z. XCOM compiles from XPL source code, but since XCOM itself is written in XPL it can compile itself ‚Äì it is a self-compiling compiler, not reliant on other compilers. Several famous languages have self-compiling compilers, including Burroughs B5000 Algol, PL/I, C, LISP, and Java. Creating such compilers is a chicken-and-egg conundrum. The language is first implemented by a temporary compiler written in some other language, or even by an interpreter (often an interpreter for an intermediate code, as BCPL can do with intcode or O-code). XCOM began as an Algol program running on Burroughs machines, translating XPL source code into System/360 machine code. The XPL team manually turned its Algol source code into XPL source code. That XPL version of XCOM was then compiled on Burroughs, creating a self-compiling XCOM for System/360 machines. The Algol version was then thrown away, and all further improvements happened in the XPL version only. This is called bootstrapping the compiler. The authors of XPL invented the tombstone diagram or T-diagram to document the bootstrapping process. Retargeting the compiler for a new machine architecture is a similar exercise, except only the code generation modules need to be changed. XCOM is a one-pass compiler (but with an emitted code fix-up process for forward branches, loops and other defined situations). It emits machine code for each statement as each grammar rule within a statement is recognized, rather than waiting until it has parsed the entire procedure or entire program. There are no parse trees or other required intermediate program forms, and no loop-wide or procedure-wide optimizations. XCOM does, however, perform peephole optimization. The code generation response to each grammar rule is attached to that rule. This immediate approach can result in inefficient code and inefficient use of machine registers. Such are offset by the efficiency of implementation, namely, the use of dynamic strings mentioned earlier: in processing text during compilation, substring operations are frequently performed. These are as fast as an assignment to an integer; the actual substring is not moved. In short, it is quick, easy to teach in a short course, fits into modest-sized memories, and is easy to change for different languages or different target machines. =ANALYZER= The XCOM compiler has a hand-written lexical scanner and a mechanically-generated parser. The syntax of the compiler's input language (in this case, XPL) is described by a simplified BNF grammar. XPL's grammar analyzer tool ANALYZER or XA turns this into a set of large data tables describing all legal combinations of the syntax rules and how to discern them. This table generation step is re-done only when the language is changed. When the compiler runs, those data tables are used by a small, language-independent parsing algorithm to parse and respond to the input language. This style of table-driven parser is generally easier to write than an entirely hand-written recursive descent parser. XCOM uses a bottom-up parsing method, in which the compiler can delay its decision about which syntax rule it has encountered until it has seen the rightmost end of that phrase. This handles a wider range of programming languages than top- down methods, in which the compiler must guess or commit to a specific syntax rule early, when it has only seen the left end of a phrase. =Runtime= XPL includes a minimal runtime support library for allocating and garbage- collecting XPL string values. The source code for this library must be included into most every program written in XPL. =SKELETON= The last piece of the XPL compiler writing system is an example compiler named SKELETON. This is just XCOM with parse tables for an example toy grammar instead of XPL's full grammar. It is a starting point for building a compiler for some new language, if that language differs much from XPL. =XMON= XPL is run under the control of a monitor, XMON, which is the only operating system-specific part of this system, and which acts as a \\"loader\\" for XCOM itself or any programs which were developed using XCOM, and also provides three auxiliary storage devices for XCOM's use, and which are directly accessed by block number. The originally published XMON was optimized for IBM 2311s. An XMON parameter FILE= enabled the monitor to efficiently use other disks with larger block sizes. A Compiler Generator page 251 The working disk block size was also a compile-time constant in XCOM. A Compiler Generator, page 372 XMON used a very simple strategy for direct disk access. NOTE provided the address of a disk track. POINT set the location of the next disk read/write to be the address returned by NOTE. This strategy was adopted to allow easy porting of XMON to other OSes, and to avoid the much more complicated direct disk options available at that time. A Compiler Generator Appendix A1,7 Converting XMON from its primitive use of NOTE, POINT and READ/WRITE disk operations‚Äîwith precisely 1 block per track‚Äîto EXCP (i.e., write/create new records) and XDAP (i.e., read/update old records)‚Äîwith n blocks per track, where n is computed at run-time from the target device's physical characteristics and can be significantly greater than 1‚Äîis an way to achieve improved performance. Although originally developed for OS/360, XMON (either the original NOTE, POINT and READ/WRITE implementation; or the EXCP and XDAP enhancement) will run on subsequently released IBM OSes, including OS/370, XA, OS/390 and z/OS, generally without any changes. Parsing XCOM originally used a now-obsolete bottom-up parse table method called Mixed Strategy Precedence, invented by the XPL team (although the officially released version retains the MSP parser and does not include later-released \\"peephole optimizations\\" and additional data types which were developed outside of the original implementation team.) MSP is a generalization of the simple precedence parser method invented by Niklaus Wirth for PL360. Simple precedence is itself a generalization of the trivially simple operator precedence methods that work nicely for expressions like A+B*(C+D)-E. MSP tables include a list of expected triplets of language symbols. This list grows larger as the cube of the grammar size, and becomes quite large for typical full programming languages. XPL-derived compilers were difficult to fit onto minicomputers of the 1970s with limited memories.Indeed, using a hand-written LALR-like analyzer and a particularly efficient \\"decomposition\\" procedure for the produced parsing tables, it was possible to generate a parser for the entire XPL language on a 2 MHz Z80 microcomputer which had only 48 kilobytes of internal memory (DRAM) and only 100 kilobytes of external memory (floppy disk) running under CP/M. This version was completed in 1980. Porting to MacOS (9, later X) was subsequently completed. MSP is also not powerful enough to handle all likely grammars. It is applicable only when the language designer can tweak the language definition to fit MSP's restrictions, before the language is widely used. The University of Toronto subsequently changed XCOM and XA to instead use a variant of Donald Knuth's LR parser bottom-up method.This version was NOT released to the general community, hence it remains proprietary to its authors, or to their institutions. Repeated requests for an SLR(1) or an LALR(1) distribution of XPL have been ignored by its authors. XCOM's variant is called Simple LR or SLR. It handles more grammars than MSP but not quite as many grammars as LALR or full LR(1). The differences from LR(1) are mostly in the table generator's algorithms, not in the compile-time parser method. XCOM and XA predate the widespread availability of Unix and its yacc parser generator tool. XA and yacc have similar purposes. XPL is open source. The System/360 version of XPL was distributed through the IBM SHARE users organization. Other groups ported XPL onto many of the larger machines of the 1970s. Various groups extended XPL, or used XPL to implement other moderate-sized languages. Applications XPL has been used to develop a number of compilers for various languages and systems. * Stony Brook Pascal * HAL/S, the language used for the Space Shuttle program * MALUS, a system programming language used by General Motors to develop their Multiple Console Time Sharing System * New England Digital used a variant of XPL, called \\"Scientific XPL\\" for their ABLE series computers, used for laboratory automation, computer networking, and control of music synthesis hardware, starting in the mid-1970s Current status XPL continues to be ported to current computers.

Life The Way to Calvary, c. 1610 The Adoration of the Shepherds, c. 1607‚Äì1610, Oil on canvas, 143 x 115cm, National Gallery of Scotland Domenichino was born in Bologna, son of a shoemaker, and there initially studied under Denis Calvaert. After quarreling with Calvaert, he left to work in the Accademia degli Incamminati of the Carracci where, because of his small stature, he was nicknamed Domenichino, meaning \\"little Domenico\\" in Italian. He left Bologna for Rome in 1602 and became one of the most talented apprentices to emerge from Annibale Carracci's supervision. As a young artist in Rome he lived with his slightly older Bolognese colleagues Albani and Guido Reni, and worked alongside Lanfranco, who later would become a chief rival. In addition to assisting Annibale with completion of his frescoes in the Galleria Farnese, including A Virgin with a Unicorn (c. 1604‚Äì05), he painted three of his own frescoes in the Loggia del Giardino of the Palazzo Farnese c. 1603‚Äì04. With the support of Monsignor Giovanni Battista Agucchi, the maggiordomo to Cardinal Aldobrandini and later Gregory XV, and Giovanni's brother Cardinal Girolamo Agucchi, Domenichino obtained further commissions in Rome. His most important project of the first decade was decoration of the Cappella dei Santissimi Fondatori in the medieval basilica of the Abbey of Grottaferrata (1608‚Äì1610), some 20 kilometers outside Rome, where Odoardo Farnese was the titular abbot. Meanwhile, he had completed frescoes c. 1604‚Äì05 in the church of Sant'Onofrio, feigned stucco decoration of 1606‚Äì07 in the Palazzo Mattei, a large scene of The Flagellation of St. Andrew at San Gregorio Magno, painted in competition with a fresco by Reni that faces it, and a ceiling with Scenes from the Life of Diana, 1609, in the Villa Odescalchi at Bassano di Sutri (today Bassano Romano). Following Annibale Carracci's death in 1609, the pupils who had followed Annibale's Roman style, including Domenichino and Francesco Albani, were not as successful at gaining the most prestigious commissions as Guido Reni. As Donald Posner stated in his influential thesis, The Roman Style of Annibale Carracci and His School, ‚Äò...it should be stressed that the severe classicism of Annibale‚Äôs late style had an immediate life in Rome of only about a lustrum [five years].‚ÄôPosner, The Roman Style of Annibale Carracci and His School (New York: 1962), p. 236. In turn, the Bolognese biographer Malvasia states that 'only Guido [Reni] was put ahead of everyone else, Guido alone proclaimed and well treated, while [Domenichino], on the contrary, was either not recognized or constantly mistreated in the fees he got, so that he was left without commissions and rejected. Therefore, he was forced to go begging for work, with much effort, through intermediaries, and at any price... the same had been true of the Flagellation of Saint Andrew, which had been painted for a hundred and fifty scudi, whereas in the case of the Adoration of the Cross on the opposite wall four hundred scudi had gone to Guido.'C. C. Malvasia Lives of Domenichino and Francesco Gessi E. Cropper, L. Pericolo (eds.) 2013, p. 65. One of Domenichino's masterpieces, his frescoes of Scenes of the Life of Saint Cecilia in the Polet Chapel of San Luigi dei Francesi, was commissioned in 1612 and completed in 1615. Concurrently he painted his first, and most celebrated, altarpiece, The Last Communion of St. Jerome for the church of San Girolamo della Carit√† (signed and dated, 1614). It subsequently would be judged as being comparable to Raphael's great Transfiguration and even as \\"the best picture in the world\\". Domenichino ‚Äì Landscape with Tobias, c. 1610-1613 By late 1616, Domenichino had designed the coffered ceiling with The Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria in Trastevere; and he had begun a cycle of ten frescoes depicting the Life of Apollo in a garden pavilion of the Villa Aldobrandini (Belvedere) in Frascati, where he was assisted by Giovanni Battista Viola, a Bolognese artist who, like Domenichino himself, was a pioneer in the development of classicistic landscape painting. From 1617 until 1621, Domenichino was absent from Rome, working in Bologna and at Fano, where during 1618‚Äì19 he frescoed the Nolfi chapel of the Fano Cathedral with Scenes from the Life of the Virgin. With the election of a Bolognese pope (Gregory XV) in 1621, Domenichino returned to Rome. Appointed Papal Architect (he built little but left drawings for various projects, most notably for the fa√ßade of Sant'Andrea della Valle and for the plan of Sant'Ignazio, both in Rome), he nonetheless continued to be most active as a painter, obtaining many commissions for altarpieces in Roman churches (San Lorenzo in Miranda, 1626‚Äì27, SS. Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio dei Bolognesi, 1626‚Äì1629, Santa Maria della Vittoria, 1629‚Äì30, and St. Peter's, 1625‚Äì1630). He also executed numerous frescoes in Rome during the 1620s: a ceiling in the Palazzo Costaguti (c. 1622); the choir and pendentives in Sant'Andrea della Valle, where he worked in fierce competition with Lanfranco, who painted the dome above Domenichino's pendentives; and the pendentives of San Silvestro al Quirinale (c. 1628) and San Carlo ai Catinari (1628‚Äì30). In spite of his activity in Rome, Domenichino decided to leave the city in 1631 to take up the most prestigious, and very lucrative, commission in Naples, the decoration of the Cappella del Tesoro di San Gennaro of the Naples Cathedral. His Scenes from the Life of San Gennaro occupied him for the rest of his life. He painted four large lunettes, four pendentives, and twelve scenes in the soffits of the arches, all in fresco, plus three large altarpieces in oil on copper. He died, perhaps by poison at the hands of the jealous Cabal of Naples, before completing the fourth altarpiece or the cupola, which was subsequently frescoed by Lanfranco. The Sacrifice of Isaac, 1627‚Äì28 At the time of his death, Domenichino's chief assistant was an obscure painter from Assisi, Francesco Raspantino, who inherited his master's studio. Earlier, Domenichino's principal pupils were Alessandro Fortuna, Giovanni Battista Ruggieri, Antonio Alberti called Barbalonga, Francesco Cozza, Andrea Camassei, and Giovanni Angelo Canini. Others who studied in his studio include Poussin, Pietro Testa, and his future biographer, Giovanni Pietro Bellori.  Ideas on art  Palazzo Farnese, Rome, after a design by Annibale Carracci Domenichino's work, developed principally from Raphael's and the Carracci's examples, mirrors the theoretical ideas of his friend Giovanni Battista Agucchi, with whom the painter collaborated on a Treatise on Painting. The portrait of Agucchi in York used to be attributed to Domenichino, but is now thought to be by Annibale Carracci, another friend. It represents what would become known as classic-idealist art, which aims to surpass the imperfections of nature by developing an \\"Idea of Beauty\\" (idea del bello) through the study and imitation of the best examples of ancient and Renaissance art. Imitation in this sense is not copying but a creative process inspired by rhetorical theory whereby revered models are not only emulated but surpassed. One of the most famous incidents in the history of art that centered on concepts of Imitation arose when Lanfranco accused Domenichino of plagiarism, specifically of having stolen the design of his great Last Communion of St. Jerome from an altarpiece of the same subject in Bologna by his former teacher, Agostino Carracci. To prove his point, Lanfranco circulated a print after Agostino's painting, prompting painters and critics to take sides, most of whom‚Äîincluding Poussin and the antiquarian-critic-biographer Bellori‚Äîstrongly defended Domenichino's work as being praiseworthy imitation. In addition to his interest in the theory of painting (he was well educated and bookish), Domenichino was devoted to music, not as a performer but to the invention of instruments suited to the stile moderno or to what Monteverdi dubbed the \\"seconda pratica\\". Like Domenichino's paintings, its sources were in ancient models and aimed at clarity of expression capable of moving its audience. As the Florentine composer Giulio Caccini held and Domenichino surely believed, the aim of the composer/artist was to \\"move the passion of the mind\\". To achieve that goal, Domenichino paid particular attention to expressive gestures. Some 1750 drawings in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle attest to the assiduous study underlying Domenichino's work‚Äîfigural, architectural, decorative, landscape, even caricature‚Äîand to the painter's brilliance as a draftsman. In Roger de Piles' Balance of 1708, an effort to quantify and compare the greatness of painters in four categories (no artist ever achieved a score above 18 in any category), the French critic awarded Domenichino 17 points for drawing (dessein), 17 for expression, 15 for composition, yet only 9 as a colorist. Domenichino's composite score of 58 nonetheless was surpassed only by Raphael and Rubens, and it equalled that of the Carracci. =Criticism from Ruskin= The Balance reflects Domenichino's high standing in the history of European taste‚Äî until John Ruskin in the 1840s wrote his devastating attacks on Bolognese Baroque painting in his Modern Painters. The Carracci and their followers were condemned by Ruskin as being \\"insincere\\". For Ruskin, there was no entirely sincere nor any great art from the seventeenth century and all was doubly damned as being \\"eclectic\\". Modern scholarship, led by Luigi Serra, John Pope-Hennessy, Evelina Borea and Richard Spear, who in 1982 published the first catalogue raisonn√© of all of Domenichino's paintings and preparatory drawings, has resurrected the artist from the Victorian graveyard and reestablished his place among the most important and influential painters of seventeenth-century Italy. In 1996 the first major exhibition of his work was held at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome.

Gytha Thorkelsd√≥ttir (, 997 ‚Äì c. 1069), also called Githa, was a Danish noblewoman. She was the mother of King Harold Godwinson and of Edith of Wessex, queen consort of King Edward the Confessor of England. Biography Gytha Thorkelsd√≥ttir was the daughter of Danish chieftain Thorgil Sprakling (also called Thorkel).Late pedigrees make Thorgil the son of the disinherited Swedish prince Styrbj√∂rn Starke, the conqueror of Jomsborg, and Tyra, the daughter of Harold Bluetooth king of Norway and Denmark. However, this descent from the old Swedish and Danish royal houses is believed to be a late invention to give her brother, the ancestor of later Danish kings, some claim to royal blood. Gytha was also the sister of the Danish Earl Ulf Thorgilsson who was married to Estrid Svendsdatter, the sister of King Cnut the Great. She married the Anglo-Saxon nobleman Godwin of Wessex. They had a large family together, and one of her sons, Harold, became king of England. Two of their sons, Harold and Tostig, faced each other at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, where Tostig was killed. Less than a month later, three of her sons, Harold, Gyrth, and Leofwine, were killed at the Battle of Hastings. Shortly after the Battle of Hastings, Gytha was living in Exeter and may have been the cause of that city's rebellion against William the Conqueror in 1067, which resulted in his laying siege to the city. She pleaded unsuccessfully with him for the return of the body of her slain son, king Harold. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Gytha left England after the Norman conquest, together with the wives or widows and families of other prominent Anglo-Saxons, all the Godwin family estates having been confiscated by William. Little else is known of Gytha's life after that time, although it is probable that she went to Scandinavia where she had relatives. Her surviving (and youngest) son, Wulfnoth, lived nearly all his life in captivity in Normandy until the death of William the Conqueror in 1087. Only her eldest daughter, Queen Edith (d. 1075), still held some power (however nominal) as the widow of King Edward the Confessor.

Ancestry and background Little is recorded about Thorgil in historical texts: most of what appears is in reference to his children, two of whom were parents of kings. Thorgil's cognomen Sprakal√§gg can be translated into English as \\"Strut-leg\\". In the Icelandic Kn√Ωtlinga saga he is also called \\"the fast\\". In the 11th century, English historian John of Worcester provided a pedigree for earl Beorn Estrithson that made his grandfather 'Spraclingus' a son of 'Ursius' (i.e. urso, Latin for bear or Bj√∏rn in Danish, Bj√∂rn in Swedish). Two 13th-century writers relate folklore that derives Thorgil from the mating of a bear with a noblewoman. Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus recorded that the son born to such a union was 'named after his father' (i.e. called 'bear' ‚Äì Ursius/Bj√∂rn) and in turn became father of 'Thrugillus, called Sprageleg'. The Gesta Antecessorum Comitis Waldevi copies John of Worcester's pedigree but makes the Ursius, father of 'Spratlingus', an actual white bear. The 14th- century chronicle sometimes attributed to John Brompton tells a very similar tale relating to the birth of Bj√∂rn, called Boresune (bear's-son), father of Siward, Earl of Northumbria, and this may represent the original form of the longer, chronologically impossible pedigree of Siward found in the Gesta that erroneously identifies Bj√∂rn Boresune with Thorgil's grandson, Beorn Estrithson. It has been suggested that the role of a bear in their immediate ancestry may represent a tradition shared by relatives rather than that two independent families at about the same time both co-opted the same ancient Norwegian legend for their immediate ancestry ‚Äì that Bj√∂rn Boresune and Thorgil may have been brothers.Timothy Bolton (2007), \\"Was the Family of Earl Siward and Earl Waltheof a Lost Line of the Ancestors of the Danish Royal Family\\", Nottingham Medieval Studies, 51:41‚Äì71 In the 18th century, Danish historian Jakob Langebek suggested this bear story was allegorical, and that the brutish 'Wild' Bj√∂rn, father of Thorgil, was a reference to Jomsviking brigand leader Styrbj√∂rn the Strong (Styrbj√∂rn Starke),Jacob Langebek (1774), Scriptores Rerum Danicarum Medii √Üvi, vol. 3, pp. 281-282P.

(1899) Anglo-Saxon Bishops, Kings, and Nobles: The Succession of the Bishops and the Pedigrees of the Kings and Nobles (London: Cambridge University Press. pp.355). Styrbj√∂rn's wife in the sagas is stated to have been Tyra of Denmark, the daughter of Harold Bluetooth, king of Denmark and Norway. No primary source supports this royal ancestry for Thorgil, a connection almost impossible to maintain because of the chronological inconsistencies. Thorgil is believed to have died circa 1009.

He is reputed, with little documentation, to have studied under Tintoretto, in part because his drawings often resemble those of the Venetian painter. He moved to Naples in 1590, where he was prodigiously active. Biography Corenzio was born in the city of Arcadia (today Kyparissia) in South West Peloponese. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, his style was \\"careless; soul, unscrupulous\\". The Encyclopaedia also claims that when Guido Reni came in 1621 to Naples to paint in the Chapel of San Gennaro in the cathedral of the Naples Cathedral, Corenzio suborned an assassin to take his life. The assassin killed Guido's assistant instead, and effectually frightened Reni, who prudently withdrew ultimately to Bologna. It was during this time that Corenzio was said to be part of a triumvirate of painters, the others being Jusepe de Ribera and Battistello Caracciolo, who formed the Cabal of Naples, leading local artists to harass, expel, or poison artists not native to Naples so they would not obtain commissions in the city. Corenzio, however, only suffered temporary imprisonment, and lived long enough to supplant Ribera in the good graces of the viceroy of Naples, who made him his court painter. Corenzio vainly endeavoured to fill Reni's place in the frescoes for the chapel. His work was adjudged to have been under the mark, and yet the numerous frescoes which he left in Neapolitan churches and palaces, and the large wall paintings which covered the cupola of the church of Monte Cassino (destroyed in 1944) are evidence of uncommon facility, and show that Corenzio was not greatly inferior to the fa prestos of his time. His florid style, indeed, seems well in keeping with the overladen architecture and full-blown decorative ornament peculiar to the Jesuit builders of the 17th century. Corenzio died, it is said, at the age of eighty-five by a fall from a scaffolding. Other sources say he poisoned himself. One of his pupils was Luigi Rodriguez.

He also was called Lo Spagnoletto (\\"the Little Spaniard\\") by his contemporaries and early writers. Ribera was a leading painter of the Spanish school, although his mature work was all done in Italy. Early life The Martyrdom of Saint Andrew, 1628 Ribera was born at X√†tiva, near Valencia, Spain, the second son of Sim√≥n Ribera and his first wife Margarita Cuc√≥. He was baptized on 17 February, 1591. His father was a shoemaker or cobbler, perhaps on a large scale. His parents intended him for a literary or learned career, but he neglected these studies and is said to have apprenticed with the Spanish painter Francisco Ribalta in Valencia, although no proof of this connection exists. Longing to study art in Italy, he made his way to Rome via Parma, where he painted Saint Martin and the Beggar, now lost, for the church of San Prospero in 1611. According to one source, a cardinal noticed him drawing from the frescoes on a Roman palace facade, and housed him. Roman artists gave him the nickname \\"Lo Spagnoletto\\". Figure studies His early biographers generally rank him among the followers of Caravaggio. Very little documentation survives from his early years, with scholars speculating as to the precise time and route by which he came to Italy. Ribera started living in Rome no later than 1612, and is documented as having joined the Academy of Saint Luke by 1613. He lived for a time in the Via Margutta, and almost certainly associated with other Caravaggisti who flocked to Rome at that time, such as Gerrit van Honthorst and Hendrick ter Brugghen, among other Utrecht painters active in Rome by 1615. In 1616, Ribera moved to Naples, in order to avoid his creditors (according to Giulio Mancini, who described him as living beyond his means despite a high income). In November, 1616, Ribera married Caterina Azzolino, the daughter of a Sicilian-born Neapolitan painter, Giovanni Bernardino Azzolino, whose connections in the Neapolitan art world helped to establish Ribera early on as a major figure, whose presence was to bear a lasting impact on the art of the city. Neapolitan period The bearded woman, 1631 The Kingdom of Naples was then part of the Spanish Empire, and ruled by a succession of Spanish Viceroys. Ribera moved to Naples permanently in the middle of 1616. His Spanish nationality aligned him with the small Spanish governing class in the city, and also with the Flemish merchant community, from another Spanish territory, who included important collectors of and dealers in art. Ribera began to sign his work as \\"Jusepe de Ribera, espa√±ol\\" (\\"Jusepe de Ribera, Spaniard\\"). He was able to quickly attract the attention of the Viceroy, Pedro T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 3rd Duke of Osuna, also recently arrived, who gave him a number of major commissions, which showed the influence of Guido Reni. The period after Osuna was recalled in 1620 seems to have been difficult. Few paintings survive from 1620 to 1626; but this was the period in which most of his best prints were produced. These were at least partly an attempt to attract attention from a wider audience than Naples. His career picked up in the late 1620s, and he was accepted as the leading painter in Naples thereafter. He received the Order of Christ of Portugal from Pope Urban VIII in 1626. Head of St John the Baptist, 1644. alt= Although Ribera never returned to Spain, many of his paintings were taken back by returning members of the Spanish governing class, for example the Duke of Osuna, and his etchings were brought to Spain by dealers. His influence can be seen in Vel√°zquez, Murillo, and most other Spanish painters of the period. He has been portrayed as selfishly protecting his prosperity, and is reputed to have been the chief in the so-called Cabal of Naples, his abettors being a Greek painter, Belisario Corenzio and the Neapolitan, Giambattista Caracciolo. It is said this group aimed to monopolize Neapolitan art commissions, using intrigue, sabotage of work in progress, and even personal threats of violence to frighten away outside competitors such as Annibale Carracci, the Cavalier d'Arpino, Reni, and Domenichino. All of them were invited to work in Naples, but found the place inhospitable. The cabal ended at the time of Domenichino's death in 1641. De Ribera's pupils included the Flemish painter Hendrick de Somer, Francesco Fracanzano, Luca Giordano, and Bartolomeo Passante. He was followed by Giuseppe Marullo and influenced the painters Agostino Beltrano, Paolo Domenico Finoglio, Giovanni Ricca, and Pietro Novelli.Jusepe Ribera at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Later life About 1644, his daughter married a Spanish nobleman in the administration, who died soon after. From 1644, Ribera seems to have suffered serious ill-health, which greatly reduced his ability to work, although his workshop continued to produce works under his direction. In 1647‚Äì1648, during the Masaniello rising against Spanish rule, he felt forced for some months to take his family with him into refuge in the palace of the Viceroy. In 1651 he sold the large house he had owned for many years, and when he died on 2 September, 1652, he was in serious financial difficulties. Work Sense of Taste In his earlier style, founded sometimes on Caravaggio and sometimes on the wholly diverse method of Correggio, the study of Spanish and Venetian masters may be traced. Along with his massive and predominating shadows, he retained from first to last a great strength in local coloring. His forms, although ordinary and sometimes coarse, are correct; the impression of his works gloomy and startling. He delighted in subjects of horror. In the early 1630s his style changed away from strong contrasts of dark and light to a more diffused and golden lighting, as may be seen in The Clubfoot of 1642. Salvator Rosa and Luca Giordano were his most distinguished followers, who may have been his pupils; others were also Giovanni Do, the Flemish painter Hendrick de Somer (known in Italy as 'Enrico Fiammingo'), Michelangelo Fracanzani, and Aniello Falcone, who was the first considerable painter of battle-pieces. Christ among the doctors, c. 1613 Among Ribera's principal works could be named Saint Januarius Emerging from the Furnace in the cathedral of Naples; the Descent from the Cross in the Certosa, Naples; the Adoration of the Shepherds (a late work; 1650) in the Louvre; the Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona; and the Pieta in the sacristy of San Martino, Naples. His mythologic subjects are often as violent as his martyrdoms: for example, Apollo and Marsyas, with versions in Brussels and Naples, or the Tityos in the Prado. The Prado owns fifty six paintings and other six attributed to Ribera, algonside with eleven drawings, like Jacob‚Äôs Dream (1639); Louvre contain four of his painting and seven drawings; the National Gallery, London, three; The Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando owns a nice ensamble of five paintings including The Assumption of Mary Magdalene from El Escorial, an early Ecce Homo or The head of St. John the Baptist. He executed several fine male portraits and a self-portrait. Saint Jerome Writing in the Prado now has been credited to him by Gianni Papi, a Caravaggio expert. He was an important etcher, the most significant Spanish printmaker before Goya, producing about forty prints, nearly all in the 1620s. The Martyrdom of Saint Philip (1639; often described as Saint Bartholomew, martyred in similar fashion, but now recognised as St Philip) [See Museo del Prado, Cat√°logo de las pinturas, 1996, p. 315, Ministerio de Educaci√≥n y Cultura, Madrid, ] is in the Prado, Madrid. Legacy Ribera's work remained in fashion after his death, largely through the hyper-naturalistic depictions of cruel subjects in the paintings of such pupils as Luca Giordano.Johnson, Paul. Art: A New History, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003. According to the 1911 11th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\"His forms, though ordinary and partly gross, are correct; the impression of his works gloomy and startling.

He painted the horrors and reality of human cruelty and showed he valued truth over idealism. The gradual rehabilitation of his international reputation was aided by exhibitions in Princeton in 1973, of his prints and drawings, and of works in all media in London at the Royal Academy in 1982 and in New York at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1992. Since then his oeuvre has gained more attention from critics and scholars. Unfortunately, due to the ebb of interest in his work for so long, a complete catalogue raisonn√© of his work is still lacking. Many works attributed to him have been altered, discarded, damaged, and neglected during his period of obscurity. File:Ixion by Jusepe de Ribera (1632).jpgIxion, 1632. Prado Museum, Madrid.

He was much patronized in Rome by both Clement and Sixtus V. He was the chief of the studio in which Caravaggio trained upon the younger painter's arrival in Rome. Biography Christ Taken Prisoner Cesari's father, Muzio Cesari, had been a native of Arpino, but Giuseppe himself was born in Rome. Here, he was apprenticed to Niccol√≤ Pomarancio. Cesari is stigmatized by Lanzi, as not less the corrupter of taste in painting than Marino was in poetry. (Lanzi disdained the style of post-Michelangelo Mannerism as a time of decline). Cesari's first major work done in his twenties was the painting of the right counterfacade of San Lorenzo in Damaso, completed from 1588 to 1589. On 28 June 1589, he received the commission for the murals of the choir vault in the Certosa di San Martino in Naples. From 1591 he was again in Rome, where he painted the vault in the Contarelli Chapel within the church of San Luigi dei Francesi. He also completed murals in the Cappella Olgiati in Santa Prassede, and the vault of the Sacristy in the Certosa di San Martino. He was a man of touchy and irascible character, and rose from penury to the height of opulence. His brother Bernardino Cesari assisted in many of his works. Cesari became a member of the Accademia di San Luca in 1585. In 1607, he was briefly jailed by the new papal administration. He died in 1640, at the age of seventy-two, or perhaps of eighty, at Rome. His only direct followers were his sons Muzio (1619‚Äì1676) and Bernardino (d. 1703). Pier Francesco Mola (1612‚Äì66) apprenticed in his studio. Other pupils include Francesco Allegrini da Gubbio, Guido Ubaldo Abatini, Vincenzo Manenti, and Bernardino Parasole. His most notable and perhaps surprising pupil was Caravaggio.

Defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.711, ISO/IEC International Standard 9596-1. It provides an implementation for the services defined by the Common Management Information Service (CMIS) specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.710, ISO/IEC International Standard 9595, allowing communication between network management applications and management agents. CMIS/CMIP is the network management protocol specified by the ISO/OSI Network management model and is further defined by the ITU-T in the X.700 series of recommendations. CMIP models management information in terms of managed objects and allows both modification and performing actions on managed objects. Managed objects are described using GDMO (Guidelines for the Definition of Managed Objects), and can be identified by a distinguished name (DN), from the X.500 directory. CMIP also provides good security (support authorization, access control, and security logs) and flexible reporting of unusual network conditions.  Services implemented  The management functionality implemented by CMIP is described under CMIS services. In a typical Telecommunications Management Network, a network management system will make use of the management operation services to monitor network elements. Management agents found on network elements will make use of the management notification services to send notifications or alarms to the network management system.  Deployment  CMIP is implemented in association with the ACSE and ROSE protocols. Both are Layer 7 OSI protocols (Application Layer). ACSE is used to manage associations between management applications (i.e. manage connections between CMIP agents). ROSE is employed for all data exchange interactions. Besides the presence of these Layer 7 protocols, CMIP assumes the presence of all OSI layers at lower levels but does not explicitly specify what these should be. There have been some attempts to adapt CMIP to the TCP/IP protocol stack. Most notable is CMOT contained in RFC 1189 (detailing CMIP over TCP). Other possibilities include RFC 1006 (which provides an ISO transport service on top of TCP), and CMIP over LPP (a presentation layer protocol that can run on top of TCP or UDP). There is also a form of CMIS that is developed to operate directly on top of the LLC sublayer. It is called the LAN/MAN Management Protocol (LMMP), formerly it was the Common Management Information Services and Protocol over IEEE 802 Logical Link Control (CMOL). This protocol does away with the need for the OSI stack as is the case with CMIP.  History  CMIP was designed in competition with SNMP, and has far more features than SNMP. For example, SNMP defines only \\"set\\" actions to alter the state of the managed device, while CMIP allows the definition of any type of action. CMIP was a key part of the Telecommunications Management Network, and enabled cross-organizational as well as cross-vendor network management. On the Internet, however, most TCP/IP devices support SNMP and not CMIP. This is because of the complexity and resource requirements of CMIP agents and management systems. CMIP is supported mainly by telecommunication devices.

Early years in Bologna Albani was born in Bologna, Italy in 1578. His father was a silk merchant who intended him to go into his own trade. By the age of twelve, however, he had become an apprentice to the competent mannerist painter Denis Calvaert, in whose studio he met Guido Reni. He soon followed Reni to the so-called \\"Academy\\" run by Annibale, Agostino, and Ludovico Carracci. This studio fostered the careers of many painters of the Bolognese school, including Domenichino, Massari, Viola, Lanfranco, Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi, Pietro Faccini, Remigio Cantagallina, and Reni. Mature work in Rome Baptism of Christ c.1640 (State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg In 1600, Albani moved to Rome to work on the fresco decoration of the gallery of the Palazzo Farnese, which was being completed by the studio of Annibale Carracci. At this time, Rome, under Clement VIII Aldobrandini (1592‚Äì1605) was exhibiting some degree of administrative stability and renewed artistic patronage. While Pope Clement had been born into a Florentine family resident in Urbino, his family was allied by marriage to the Emilia-Romagna and the Farnese, since Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma had married Margherita Aldobrandini. Parma, like Bologna, being part of the Region of Emilia-Romagna, it was not surprising that Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, Ranuccio's brother, chose to patronise the Carraccis from Bologna, thereby establishing Bolognese dominance of Roman fresco painting for nearly two decades. Albani became one of Annibale's most prominent apprentices. Using Annibale's designs and assisted by Lanfranco and Sisto Badalocchio, Albani completed frescoes for the San Diego Chapel in San Giacomo degli Spagnoli between 1602 and 1607. In 1606‚Äì7, Albani completed the frescoes in the Palazzo Mattei di Giove in Rome. He later completed two other frescoes in the same palace, also on the theme of Life of Joseph. In 1609, he completed the ceiling of a large hall with Fall of Phaeton and Council of the Gods for the Palazzo Giustiniani (now Palazzo Odescalchi) at Bassano (di Sutri) Romano. This work was commissioned by Vincenzo Giustiniani, also famous as a patron of Caravaggio. During 1612‚Äì14, Albani completed the Choir frescoes at the church of Santa Maria della Pace which had just been remodelled by Pietro da Cortona. In 1616 he painted ceiling frescoes of Apollo and the Seasons at Palazzo Verospi in Via del Corso for the cardinal Fabrizio Verospi. In his later years, Albani developed a mutual, though respectful, rivalry with the more successful Guido Reni, who was also heavily patronized by the Aldobrandini, and under whom Albani had worked under at the chapel of the Palazzo del Quirinale. Albani's best frescoes are those on mythological subjects. Among the best of his sacred subjects are a St Sebastian and an Assumption of the Virgin, both in the church of San Sebastiano fuori le Mura in Rome. He was among the Italian painters to devote himself to painting cabinet pictures. His mythological subjects include The Sleeping Venus, Diana in the Bath, Dana√´ Reclining, Galatea on the Sea, and Europa on the Bull. A rare etching, the Death of Dido, is attributed to him. Carlo Cignani, Andrea Sacchi, Francesco Mola, and Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi were among his students. Following the death of his wife he returned to Bologna, where he married a second time and lived until his death. Legacy Albani never acquired the monumentality or tenebrism that was quaking the contemporary world of painters, and is often derided for his lyric, cherubim-filled sweetness, which often has not yet shaken the mannerist elegance. While Albani's thematic would have appealed to Poussin, he lacked the Frenchman's muscular drama. His style sometimes seems to have more in common with the decorative Rococo than with the painting of his own time. Among his pupils were his brother Giovanni Battista Albani, and others including Giacinto Bellini, Girolamo Bonini, Giacinto Campagna, Antonio Catalani, Carlo Cignani, Giovanni Maria Galli, Filippo Menzani, Bartolommeo Morelli, Andrea Sacchi, Andrea Sghizzi, Giovanni Battista Speranza, Antonio Maria del Sole, Emilio Taruffi, and Francesco Vaccaro.Hobbes, p.3 Major works * See Chronological List of paintings by Francesco Albani *Frescoes in Hall of Aeneas -Palazzo Fava, Bologna *Frescoes in Oratory of San Colombano - Bologna *Frescoes in Hall of Aeneas (1601‚Äì1602) - Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome *Frescoes for San Giacomo degli Spagnoli (1602‚Äì1607) - Museo del Prado and in National Art Museum of Catalonia *Holy Family with Angels (1608‚Äì1610) - MFA, Boston *Allegorical canvases of the seasons Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter (1616‚Äì1617) - Galleria Borghese, Rome *Nativity of the Virgin (1598) - Pinacoteca, Museo Capitolino, Rome *Baptism of Christ (c. 1620) - Oil on canvas, 428.5 x 224.5 cm, Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna *Diana and Actaeon (1625‚Äì1630) - Oil on wood transferred to canvas, 74,5 x 99,5 cm, Gem√§ldegalerie, Dresden *Four Elements (1628‚Äì1630) - Pinacoteca, Turin *Holy Family with Angels (1630‚Äì1635) - Oil on canvas, 57 x 43 cm, Palazzo Pitti, Florence *Self-Portrait (c. 1630) - Oil on canvas, 75 x 59.5 cm, Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna *Venus Attended by Nymphs and Cupids (1633) -Oil on canvas, 114 x 171 cm, Prado, Madrid) *Annunciation (1633) - Church of San Bartolomeo, Bologna *The Annunciation - Oil on copper, 62 x 47 cm, Hermitage, St. Petersburg *Madonna with Child in Glory with Sts.

The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in Vermont takes its name, in part, from Marsh. His 1864 book Man and Nature had a great impact in many parts of the world.  Biography  George Perkins Marsh was born in Woodstock, Vermont, to a prominent family. His father, Charles Marsh, had been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. George Marsh graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, in 1816 and from Dartmouth College with highest honors in 1820. He studied law in Burlington, Vermont, was admitted to the bar in 1825, and practiced law in Burlington. He also devoted himself to philological studies. In 1835 he was appointed to the Executive Council of Vermont, and from 1843 to 1849 was a Whig representative in Congress. He served as an editor of Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley which was published in 1848. In 1849 President Zachary Taylor appointed Marsh United States minister resident in the Ottoman Empire. He rendered valuable service to the cause of civil and religious toleration in that empire. In 1852‚Äì1853, he discharged a mission to Greece in connection with the imprisonment of American missionary Jonas King. He accomplished this task with a vigor that surprised the diplomats of Athens and showed a masterly knowledge of the Greek constitution and legislation, as well as of international law. Marsh was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1851.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He returned to Vermont in 1854. In 1857 he was appointed by the governor of Vermont to make a report to the legislature in regard to the artificial propagation of fish. He had previously been appointed one of the commissioners to rebuild the state house at Montpelier and in 1857 was appointed as the state railroad commissioner, succeeding Charles Linsley. In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Marsh the first United States minister to the Kingdom of Italy. Marsh would go on to be the longest-serving chief of mission in U.S. history, serving as envoy for 21 years until his death at Vallombrosa in 1882.United States Department of State He is buried at the Protestant Cemetery in Rome. Work Marsh was an able linguist, able to both speak and write fluently in Swedish and over 20 other languages. He was a remarkable philologist for his day, and a scholar of great breadth, knowing much of military science, engraving and physics, as well as Icelandic, which was his specialty. He wrote many articles for Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia, and contributed many reviews and letters to The Nation. He was an admirer of the Goths, whose presence he traced in whatever is great and peculiar in the character of the founders of New England. He owned the finest collection of Scandinavian literature outside of Scandinavia. Part of it ultimately became the property of the University of Vermont, through the liberality of Frederick Billings. During the winter of 1858/9 he began a course of thirty lectures on the English language at Columbia University, and a year later he delivered a second course, on the grammatical history of English literature, before the Lowell Institute, in Boston. Marsh played a role in the creation of the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary by acting as Coordinator of the American readers. In 1847 Marsh gave a speechhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jun/20/george-perkins- marsh-climate-speech to the Agricultural Society of Rutland County, Vermont, becoming the first modern thinker to theorize that man's activities influence climate (but never mentioning carbon dioxide): \\"Man cannot at his pleasure command the rain and the sunshine, the wind and frost and snow, yet it is certain that climate itself has in many instances been gradually changed and ameliorated or deteriorated by human action. The draining of swamps and the clearing of forests perceptibly effect the evaporation from the earth, and of course the mean quantity of moisture suspended in the air. The same causes modify the electrical condition of the atmosphere and the power of the surface to reflect, absorb and radiate the rays of the sun, and consequently influence the distribution of light and heat, and the force and direction of the winds. Within narrow limits too, domestic fires and artificial structures create and diffuse increased warmth, to an extent that may effect vegetation. The mean temperature of London is a degree or two higher than that of the surrounding country, and Pallas believed, that the climate of even so thinly a peopled country as Russia was sensibly modified by similar causes.\\" His book Man and Nature (1864) constituted an early work of ecology, and played a role in the creation of the Adirondack Park. Marsh argued that deforestation could lead to desertification. Referring to the clearing of once-lush lands surrounding the Mediterranean, he asserted \\"the operation of causes set in action by man has brought the face of the earth to a desolation almost as complete as that of the moon.\\" He argued that welfare is secured as long as man manages resources and keep them in good condition. Welfare of future generations should be one of resource management determinants. Resource scarcity is a result of misbalancing an environmental equilibrium. In other words: it comes from unreasonable human action rather than is determined by some absolute resource scarcity.

This last work was left incomplete, the second volume never having been published. She also translated from the German of Johann C. Biernatzki (1795‚Äì1840), The Hallig; or the Sheepfold in the Waters (1856). (See \\"Hallig\\"). Art collection Marsh actively studied and collected engravings, including European Old Master prints. His collection included more than a thousand prints by various artists, dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries, representing works by Rembrandt, Albrecht D√ºrer, William Hogarth and others. In 1849, the Smithsonian Institution purchased a large group of Marsh's European prints and art books, which was transferred on deposit to the Library of Congress in 1865. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Smithsonian got some of the Marsh Collection returned, but part of it still remains at the Library of Congress.

Biography He graduated from Yale in 1886, was a graduate student there for three years, and studied at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens (1887-1889) and in Leipzig (1889-1892). In 1892 he became professor of Sanskrit and Indo-European comparative philology at the University of Chicago, and was later named Martin A. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Comparative Philology. In his early career, he concentrated on the Italic dialects, including among his published work, Der Vocalismus der oskischen Sprache (1892), The Oscan-Umbrian Verb-System (1895), and Grammar of Oscan and Umbrian, with a collection of inscriptions and a glossary (1904), and a pr√©cis of the Italic languages in Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia. He collaborated with W.G. Hale in the preparation of A Latin Grammar (1903). Later, he worked extensively on the Greek dialects, publishing: The Greek dialects; grammar, selected inscriptions, glossary (1910), Comparative grammar of Greek and Latin (1933); and on more general Indo-European issues. His Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages was called by Calvert Watkins \\"a treasure house of words, word origins, expressions, and ideas..., a monument to a great American scholar\\".(1949, reprinted 1988, ) Upon his death, the New York Times reported that Buck spoke 30 languages.

He served from 1993 to 2001 as the twenty-fifth and longest-serving chairman of the commission. Widely hailed as a champion of the individual investor, he has been criticized for not pushing for tougher accounting rules. Since May 2001 he has been employed as a senior adviser at the Carlyle Group.The Carlyle Group : Levitt, Arthur Levitt previously served as a policy advisor to Goldman Sachs and is a Director of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News. Early life and career Levitt grew up in a Jewish family in Brooklyn.Washington Post: \\"The Quiet Crusader at the SEC\\" By Brett D. Fromson September 28, 1997 Levitt's father, Arthur Levitt Sr., served as New York State Comptroller for 24 years and was sole trustee of the largest pension fund in America at the time. Levitt attended Brant Lake Camp, a summer camp for boys in the Adirondacks. He attended and graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn in 1948. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Williams College in 1952, before serving for two years in the Air Force. He first worked as a drama critic for The Berkshire Eagle, and after the Air Force, he was with Time-Life for five years before selling cattle and ranches as tax shelters. In 1963, Levitt joined the brokerage firm Carter, Berlind & Weill, founded three years earlier by Sanford I. Weill.Arthur Levitt: Career Highlights . Bloomberg BusinessWeek Levitt's name was eventually added to the firm's when it was renamed Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt in the mid-1960s; through a series of mergers the firm eventually evolved into Shearson Loeb Rhoades. This experience with retail customers was a source of his interest in the small investor. After sixteen years on Wall Street, Levitt became the Chairman of the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in 1978. In 1989, he left the AMEX to serve as Chairman of the New York City Economic Development Corporation until 1993. Before joining the SEC, Levitt owned Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Capitol Hill, which he purchased from the paper's founder, Sid Yudain, in 1986. The newspaper was eventually sold to The Economist for $15 million in 1993. Chairman of the SEC Levitt was appointed to his first five-year term as Chairman of the SEC by President Clinton in July 1993 and reappointed in May 1998. He left the Commission on February 9, 2001, and was succeeded by Harvey Pitt. Levitt has said that he first learned of his being considered for the job from The Wall Street Journal. At the time Levitt came to the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) had proposed requiring companies to record stock options on their income statements, which split the accounting industry and was opposed by many in the American business community. According to a Merrill Lynch study, expensing stock options would have reduced profits among leading high-tech companies by 60% on average. Congress began to exert pressure on the FASB, and on May 3, 1994, the Senate, led by Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman, offered a non-binding resolution urging FASB not to adopt the proposed rule; the vote in favor was 88‚Äì9. Concerned that insensitivity to this sentiment in Congress might threaten FASB as an independent standard setter, Levitt urged the FASB to not go ahead with the rule proposal. He later said this \\"was probably the single biggest mistake I made in my years at the SEC.\\" Containing excerpts from FRONTLINE's interviews. In September 1998 at New York University, he gave a speech entitled \\"The Numbers Game\\". It addressed five ways in which corporations were managing earnings (big bath charges, creative acquisition accounting, cookie-jar reserves, materiality, revenue recognition). In his speech, Levitt advocated improving the transparency and comparability of financial statements. In 1997, the SEC under Levitt's leadership approved the exemption of some Enron partnerships from the tight accounting controls of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Without this exemption, critics maintain, the company would have been constrained by strict rules found in 1996 legislation that would have prohibited certain foreign investments and the shifting of debt to its foreign subsidiary shell companies. During Levitt's tenure at the SEC, he was widely viewed as a pro- investor advocate and received favorable press coverage. More recently he has come under criticism for failing to act against 1990s bull market abuses and not uncovering Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. After the SEC Levitt serves on the Board of Directors for RiskMetrics Group. In 2005, Levitt was named a special advisor to the American International Group's board of directors and the board's nominating and corporate governance committee following the resignation of CEO and Chairman Maurice \\"Hank\\" Greenberg, who left after an investigation into the firm's accounting practices by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Levitt oversaw an audit published in August 2006, by Kroll Inc. ‚Äì where he is a consultant ‚Äì describing how the City of San Diego had allowed a pension deficit of $1.43 billion. The report blamed around 30 city officials, including five incumbent council members. Kroll charged the City of San Diego $21 million for the report, with Levitt's time billed at $900 per hour. Awards and honors In January 2001, Levitt received the \\"Award for Distinguished Leadership in Global Capital Markets\\" from the Yale School of Management.

Hendrickson, \\"William Gardner Hale,\\" 24 Classic J. 167-73 (Dec. 1928). Hale was a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy. He graduated at Harvard University in 1870, and took a post-graduate course in philosophy there in 1874‚Äì1876; studied classical philology at Leipzig and G√∂ttingen in 1876‚Äì1877; was tutor in Latin at Harvard from 1877 to 1880, and succeeding Tracy Peck as professor of Latin in Cornell University from 1880 to 1892, when he became professor of Latin and head of the Latin department of the University of Chicago. From 1894 to 1899 he was chairman and in 1895-1896 first director of the American School of Classical Studies at Rome. Hale held honorary degrees from Princeton, St. Andrew's and Aberdeen Universities.Prof. W.G. Hale, Latin Scholar, Dies, N.Y. Times (June 24, 1928). He is best known as an original teacher on questions of syntax. In The cum-constructions: their history and functions, which appeared in Cornell University studies in classical philology (1888‚Äì1889; and in German version by Neizert in 1891), he attacked Hoffmann's distinction between absolute and relative temporal clauses as published in Lateinische Zeitpartikeln (1874); Hoffmann replied in 1891, and the best summary of the controversy is in Wetzel's Der Streit zwischen Hoffmann und Hale (1892). Hale wrote also The sequence of tenses in Latin (1887‚Äì1888), The anticipatory subjunctive in Greek and Latin (1894), and a Latin grammar (1903), to which the parts on sounds, inflection and word-formation were contributed by Carl Darling Buck. After founding the American School of Classical Studies, Rome, 1905‚Äì06, Professor Hale served as its director and later, chairman of the board. Returning to Chicago, Hale was Editor, The Classical Quarterly in 1914. He continued his teaching and retired from the university in 1920, spending the next eight years conducting research on a manuscript of Catullus he discovered in Rome in 1896.  Family  William Gardner Hale was son to William Hale and Elizabeth Jewett Scott of Peterboro, N.H. Professor Hale was spouse to Harriet Swinburne (1853‚Äì1928) of Newport, Rhode Island, an 1873 graduate of Vassar College. The couple had four children, including fresco painter and interior decorator Gardner Hale (1900‚Äì1932) of New York City, and Swinburne Hale (1884‚Äì1937), a prominent civil rights attorney and political activist of the 1920s. One daughter, Mrs. Vancil Foster, resided at Taos, New Mexico and another daughter, Miss Virginia Hall, resided in New York City.Mrs. W. Gardner Hale; Wife of Latin Professor Dies of Pneumonia at Shippan Point, N.Y. Times (April 15, 1928).  Multilateralist  When the German Empire invade Belgium in 1914, Professor Hale was abroad in Europe. He cabled the New York Times from Le Havre, France, and permitted his name to be published with his cable recommending the United States declare war on Germany.W.G. Hale for War; Chicago Professor, Accusing Germans, Would Have Us Take Action, N.Y. Times (Sep. 5, 1914). Six months into the First World War, the Wilson Administration had succeeded in keeping the United States neutral. Professor Hale called for war in September 1914; in January 1915 he was in partial agreement with former President Theodore Roosevelt on the need to act against the German Empire. But like fellow progressive Alfred Hayes, Jr., William Gardner Hale viewed the American role as supporting the internationalist and multilateral position represented by the Hague Conventions. Roosevelt was defining the unilateralist tenet that would become a hallmark of 20th century Republican Party foreign policy doctrine.See generally, Prof. Hale on Defense; The Hague Conventions, N.Y. Times (Jan. 15, 1915). On in May 1916, Hale agreed to serve as an honorary vice president of the American Rights Committee during its Carnegie Hall memorial protest of the Lusitania sinking by a German Navy U-Boat. The purpose of the mass meeting was to organize a petition to President Woodrow Wilson demanding an end of diplomatic relations with the Imperial Court at Berlin. New York City Mayor John Purroy Mitchel succeeded in postponing the protest, in part to ameliorate worsening relations in the city between the pro-Allied and pro-German factions.Mayor Calls Off Lusitania Meeting, N.Y. Times (May 7, 1916). In the 1916 Presidential election, William Gardner Hale endorsed Woodrow Wilson over Charles Evans Hughes. Hale's position was based on his concern that Hughes would draw the United States into another war with the Republic of Mexico and that Wilson, while not supportive enough of the Allies in Europe, \\"had the high aim of building up a national life in which, while honest business shall have every opportunity, privilege shall not rule the poor and the weak. He has made of his party a truly progressive party.\\"Errors of the Pro-Allies; Prof. W.G. Hale on Their Mistaken Support of Mr. Hughes, N.Y. Times (Nov. 6, 1916). Hale was a member of the New England Anti-Imperialist League, as well as the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the German Archaeological Institute of Berlin, Athens and Rome, and the American Philological Association (APA).

Biography Hoffmann was born at W√ºrzburg. After studying at W√ºrzburg, he went on the stage in 1825; but owing to an accidental meeting with the German traveller, Philipp Franz von Siebold (1796‚Äì1866), in July 1830, his interest was diverted to Oriental philology. From Siebold he acquired the rudiments of Japanese, and in order to take advantage of the instructions of Ko-ching-chang, a Chinese teacher whom Siebold had brought home with him, he made himself acquainted with Malay, the only language except Chinese which Ko-ching-chang could understand. In a few years he was able to supply the translations for Siebold's Nippon, and the high character of his work soon attracted the attention of older scholars. Stanislas Julien invited him to Paris, and he would probably have accepted the invitation, as a disagreement had broken out between him and Siebold, had not M. Baud, the Dutch colonial minister, appointed him Japanese translator with a salary of 1800 florins (¬£150). Works J. J. Hoffmann The Dutch authorities were slow in giving him further recognition; and he was too modest a man successfully to urge his claims. It was not till after he had received the offer of the professorship of Chinese in King's College London, that the authorities made him professor at Leiden and the king allowed him a yearly pension. In 1875, he was decorated with the order of the Netherlands Lion, and in 1877 he was elected corresponding member of the Berlin Academy. He died at the Hague on 23 January 1878. Hoffmann's chief work was his unfinished Japanese Dictionary begun in 1839 and afterwards continued by L. Serrurier. Unable at first to procure the necessary type, he set himself to the cutting of punches, and even when the proper founts were obtained he had to act as his own compositor as far as Chinese and Japanese were concerned.

Julien was a student of Jean-Pierre Abel-R√©musat, and succeeded him as the chair of Chinese at the Coll√®ge de France upon R√©musat's death in 1832. The quantity and quality of Julien's scholarship earned him wide renown, and caused him to become the leading European scholar of China during the 19th century. Among 19th-century scholars of China, Julien's academic reputation was rivaled only by the Scottish sinologist James Legge, and no sinologist equaled his academic reputation until √âdouard Chavannes at the turn of the 20th century. Notwithstanding his academic rigor and gifted intellect, Julien had a notoriously thorny personality and publicly feuded with most of his contemporaries, earning broad academic respect but equally broad personal dislike from those who knew him. Biography Julien, age 65 (1862) Born at Orl√©ans on 13 April 1797, Julien initially struggled to obtain higher education due to his family's relative poverty. He studied at the college in Orl√©ans before transferring to the Coll√®ge de France, where he initially focused on Greek language and literature before branching out into Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Sanskrit. In 1821 he was appointed assistant professor of Greek. In the same year he published an edition of The Rape of Helen of Coluthus, with versions in French, Latin, English, German, Italian and Spanish. He attended the lectures of Jean-Pierre Abel-R√©musat on Chinese. In late 1823 Julien met Jean-Pierre Abel-R√©musat, the first-ever professor of Chinese at the Coll√®ge de France, and began studying Chinese with him. In 1824, only six months after meeting R√©musat, Julien began a Latin translation of the Mencius, working from eight different Chinese editions and two Manchu editions, Julien having simultaneously begun studying Manchu. The work was published in Paris with the lengthy title Meng Tseu vel Mencium inter Sinenses philosophos, ingenio, doctrina, nominisque claritate Confucio proximum, edidit, Latina interpretatione, ad interpretationem Tartaricam utramque recensita, instruixit, et perpetuo commentario, e Sinicis deprompto, illustravit Stanislaus Julien. Julien's attention to textual variants among different editions was remarkable for his era, and was lauded by his teacher R√©musat, whose review gave such praises as: \\"M. Julien s'est livr√© √† une lecture assidue du texte de Mencius; il a √©tudi√© le style de cet auteur, et s'est p√©n√©tr√© de tout ce que son langage offre de particulier.\\" (\\"Mr. Julien has delivered an assiduous reading of the text of the Mencius; he has studied the style of this author, and has penetrated all that his language particularly has to offer.\\") Soon afterwards he translated the modern Greek odes of Kalvos under the title of La Lyre patriotique de la Gr√®ce. In 1827 he was appointed sublibrarian to the Institut de France. In 1832 he succeeded Abel-R√©musat as professor of Chinese at the Coll√®ge de France. In 1833 he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions. Histoire et Fabrication de la Porcelaine. The characters ÊôØÂæ∑ÈéÆÈô∂ÈåÑ Jingdezhen Taolu are in seal script For some years his studies had been directed towards the vernacular literature of the Chinese, bringing out translations of Hoei-lan-ki ÁÅ∞ÈóåË®ò (L'Histoire du cercle de craie), a drama in which occurs a scene curiously analogous to the Judgment of Solomon; and the Ë∂ôÊ∞èÂ≠§ÂÖí Zhao shi guer [Tchao-chi kou eul], The Orphan of Zhao, or Orphan of the House Tcho. He next turned to the Taoist writings, and translated in 1835 Le Livre des r√©compenses et des peines Â§™‰∏äÊÑüÊáâÁØá Taishang Ganying Pian. About this time the cultivation of silkworms was beginning to attract attention in France, and by order of the minister of agriculture Julien compiled, in 1837, a R√©sum√© des principaux traits chinois sur la culture des m√ªriers, et l'√©ducation des vers-de-soie Ê°ëË†∂ËºØË¶Å, which was speedily translated into English, German, Italian and Russian. He published in 1841 Discussions grammaticales sur certaines r√©gles de position qui, en chinois, jouent le m√™me r√¥le que les inflexions dans les autres langues, which he followed in 1842 by Exercices pratiques d'analyse, de syntaxe, et de lexigraphie chinoise. Meanwhile, in 1839, he had been appointed joint keeper of the Biblioth√®que Royale, with the special superintendence of the Chinese books, and shortly afterwards he was made administrator of the Coll√®ge de France. In 1842 saw the publication of his translation of the ÈÅìÂæ∑Á∂ì Dao De Jing. Then he turned his attention to the Buddhist literature of China, and more especially to the travels of Buddhist pilgrims to India. In order that he might better understand the references to Indian institutions and the transcriptions in Chinese of Sanskrit words and proper names, he began the study of Sanskrit, and in 1853 brought out his Voyages du p√©lerin Hiouen-tsang Â§ßÂîêË•øÂüüË®ò Da Tang Xi You Ji. Six years later he published Les Avadanas, contes et apologues indiens inconnus jusqu'√† ce jour, suivis de po√©sies et de nouvelles chinoises. For the benefit of future students he disclosed his system of deciphering Sanskrit words occurring in Chinese books in his M√©thode pour d√©chiffrer et transcrire les noms sanscrits qui se rencontrent dans les livres chinois (1861). The work had escaped the author's observation that, since the translations of Sanskrit works into Chinese were undertaken in different parts of the empire, the same Sanskrit words were of necessity differently represented in Chinese characters in accordance with the dialectical variations. No hard and fast rule can therefore possibly be laid down for the decipherment of Chinese transcriptions of Sanskrit words. Known for his impatience and bad temper, he had bitter controversies with his fellow Sinologists. His Indian studies led to a controversy with Joseph Toussaint Reinaud. Among the many subjects to which he turned his attention were the native industries of China, producing the Histoire et fabrication de la porcelaine chinoise ÊôØÂæ∑ÈéÆÈô∂ÈåÑ Jingdezhen Taolu. In another volume he also published an account of the Industries anciennes et modernes de l'Empire chinois (1869), translated from native authorities. His last work of importance was Syntaxe nouvelle de la langue Chinoise fond√©e sur la position des mots, suivie de deux trait√©s sur les particules et les principaux termes de grammaire, d'une table des idiotismes, de fables, de l√©gendes et d'apologues (1869), for many years the standard grammar for the Chinese language. In politics Julien was imperialist, and in 1863 he was made a commander of the L√©gion d'honneur in recognition of the services he had rendered to literature during the Second French Empire. In 1872 the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres established the Prix Stanislas Julien, an annual prize for a sinological work which was first awarded in 1875.

Double-decker buses are used for mass transport in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and many former European possessions, the most iconic example being the red London bus, namely the AEC Routemaster. Early double-deckers put the driver in a separate cab. Passenger access was via an open platform at the rear, and a bus conductor would collect fares. Modern double-deckers have a main entrance door at the front, and the driver takes fares, thus halving the number of bus workers aboard, but slowing the boarding process. The rear open platform, popular with passengers, was abandoned for safety reasons, as there was a risk of passengers falling when running and jumping onto the bus. Double-deckers are primarily for commuter transport but open-top models are used as sight-seeing buses for tourists. William Gladstone, speaking of London's double-deck horse-drawn omnibuses, once observed that \\"...the best way to see London is from the top of a bus\\".Elbert Hubbard Little Journeys to the Homes of Good Men and Great (1894‚Äì1918) William E. Gladstone The full quote is: : Then he asked if we were going to London. On being told that we were, he spoke for five minutes about the things we should see in the Metropolis. His style was not conversational, but after the manner of a man who was much used to speaking in public or to receiving delegations. The sentences were stately, the voice rather loud and declamatory. His closing words were: \\"Yes, gentlemen, the way to see London is from the top of a 'bus‚Äîfrom the top of a 'bus, gentlemen.\\" By country Cities listed here have double-decker buses as part of their regular mass transit fleet. Cities with only tourist and sightseeing double-decker buses are excluded. Europe =United Kingdom= An historical Brixton to Clapham horse-drawn bus on display at London Bus Museum. An Arriva Southern Counties Volvo B7TL in England Hedingham Volvo Olympian in England The first commercial horse-drawn double-decker omnibuses were introduced in England in 1847 by Adams & Co. of Fairfield, Bow, then improved upon by John Greenwood, who introduced a new double-decker in 1852. Double-decker buses are in common use throughout the United Kingdom, and have been favoured over articulated buses by many operators because of the shorter length of double-deckers and larger amount of seating capacity; they also may be safer to operate through the narrow streets and tight corners common in Britain. The majority of double-decker buses in the UK are between and long, the latter being more common since the mid-1990s, though there are three-axle models in service with some operators. Double-decker coaches in the UK have traditionally been in length, though many newer models are about .

She drove for the bus company Felix Bus Services, then at Hatfield near Doncaster.Felix Motors Limited 1921-1976. Retrieved 11 August 2010Contribution to victory. The Associated Equipment Co. Ltd. Page 85. Retrieved 11 August 2010 The red double-decker buses in London have become a national symbol of England. The majority of buses in London are double-deckers. A particularly iconic example was the AEC Routemaster bus, which had been a staple of the public transport network in London for nearly half a century following its introduction in 1956. Because of cited difficulties accommodating disabled passengers, the last remaining Routemasters in use finally retired from general service in 2005. Transport for London has continued to keep these vintage buses in operation on heritage route 15H,Routemaster \\"heritage routes\\" there was formerly a second heritage route (9H) but this ceased operation in 2014 due to low patronage and increased operation costs. In 2007, a hybrid-powered double-decker entered service on London Buses route 141. By late 2008, more hybrid double-deckers from three manufacturers entered service in London. A New Routemaster was developed that year, and entered service on 20 February 2012. In October 2015, London added five all-electric double-decker buses - the world's first - made by Chinese firm BYD. =Isle of Man= Bus Vannin operate several double- deckers on routes all across the island. =Republic of Ireland= Dublin Bus Alexander bodied Volvo Olympian In the Republic of Ireland, nearly all of buses operated in and around Greater Dublin by Dublin Bus are double-deckers. There are 1,000 double-decker buses (second after London) in the company's fleet of 1,008 (October 2019). Bus √âireann also utilises double-decker buses on some of its commuter routes, such as the Dublin to Dundalk service. Double- deckers are also common on some of the company's suburban routes in Cork city. More luxurious Double-Deckers are used on Intercity Routes like the XI Dublin- Belfast Route or X3/X4 Dublin-Derry route. =Austria= Double decker buses were in use on city services in Vienna between 1960 and 1991. They are used on services between Vienna and its airport, and also operated by √ñtztaler Verkehrsgesellschaft (√ñVG) under contract to √ñBB-Postbus on service 4420 between Innsbruck and Lienz. =Czech Republic= Since 2020, 2 Scania UNVI Urbis DD CNG cars have been running on public transport lines in Ostrava. During working days on lines 20 and 78. Over the weekend and holidays during the summer season on line 88. =Dennmark= Since 1970, various operators of Copenhagen city transport were using double-deckers‚Äîoriginally Leyland, in the 1980s‚Äì1990s MAN and in the 2000s Volvo, derivates of model B7. =France= Left, double-decker bus Schneider Brilli√© P2; Center, double decker horse- drawn omnibus in Paris, France. The first French double-decker bus was brought into service in Paris in 1853; it was a horse-drawn omnibus. The upper floor was cheaper and often uncovered. The first double-decker motor bus in Paris, the Schneider Brilli√© P2, appeared in 1906. It was designed to carry more passengers and to replace the horse-drawn double-decker omnibus. Like trams and omnibuses, double-decker motor buses included two classes of travel: first class inside the car and second class outdoors on top. But this type of vehicle was withdrawn in 1911 because one of them overturned at place de l'√âtoile; following this incident the P2s lost their upper deck and were renamed as P3s. It was not until 1966 that the RATP retried double-deckers on two lines in Paris. A prototype built by Berliet (type E-PCMR), was put into service in 1966, with an order being placed for 25 vehicles. The first production car was commissioned on 19 June 1968 on line 94, Gare Montparnasse - Levallois. On 17 February 1969, line 53, Opera - Porte d'Asnieres was in turn equipped with this model. But traffic problems caused RATP to definitively abandon this vehicle in 1977, because this type of bus is poorly suited to the structure of the Paris network, the stops being too close to each other which prevented people from going upstairs. Hence, there are no Parisian mass transit lines using double-decker buses. SITAC operates a service 5 between Calais and Sangatte using a double decker bus. =Germany= MAN A39 in Berlin, Germany In Germany, double-decker buses in Berlin are operated by Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG). The fleet of double-decker buses in Berlin fell from 1,000 in 1992 to 450 in 2002. The models in operation in 2004 were long and held around 95 passengers. The replacements, which are supplied by Neoman Bus, are longer. The new buses are able to hold 128 passengers. =Italy= During the 1960s and 1970s major cities like Turin, Milan, Rome, Florence, Verona, Bologna, Rimini, Naples, Bari and Palermo adopted Fiat double decker buses. The most common model was the Fiat 412 Aerfer, and in 1961 it was replaced by Fiat 413 Viberti Monotral CV61. =Liechtenstein= Liemobil operates 4 double decker MAN A39 buses on service 11 between Sargans, Switzerland and Feldkirch, Vorarlberg, Austria and on other services 12, 13 & 14 in the country. =Netherlands= It is only very recently that double-decker buses have started to be used in the Netherlands. On 10 December 2017 Connexxion put 18 3-axle double deckers into service on route 346 between Haarlem and Amsterdam Zuid, a heavily-used commuter route not served by rail. They are Futura FDD2s built by VDL Bus & Coach in Valkenswaard, are 14.1 metres long, and carry 86 seated passengers.https://www.vdlgroep.com/en/news/archief/2017/100-electric-vdl- citeas-and-18-vdl-futura-double-deckers-for-connexxion Their introduction was not without problems since their route initially had to be diverted to avoid passing under a dangerously low tram overhead wire near the VU Medical Centre stop.https://weekbladvoorouderamstel.nl/lokaal/klachtenlawine-bij- connexxion-321067 Also in December 2017, Qbuzz introduced 5 double-deckers on its route 300 between Groningen and Emmen. These are Van Hool TDX27 Astromegas, also 14.1 metres long and carrying 85 passengers. =North Macedonia= Yutong City Master in Skopje, North Macedonia The Macedonian government bought 217 Yutong City Master double-decker city buses for local transport in Skopje, the capital. The first shipment of 68 custom-made buses arrived in Skopje in 2011 from China's Zhengzhou Yutong factory. The buses were put into operation on 8 September 2011, coinciding with the day of Macedonian independence. This model of bus has capacity for 80 passengers. =Norway= In June 2008 Boreal Transport on contract with Kolumbus introduced three double-decker buses to provide more seating for certain high- traffic departures in Stavanger. =Portugal= Double-deck bus in Porto, Portugal Double-decker buses in Portugal were introduced during the 1950s when buses in general started to be driven in the main cities of the country, such as Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and Set√∫bal. The type of buses were built by AEC (Regent) and later, vehicles produced by Daimler (Fleetline) and Leyland (Atlantean) with Portuguese bodywork or original. there was also one Leyland Olympian as a demonstrational bus for Lisbon. In Porto, there were double- decker trolleybuses, produced by Lancia and with Dalfa bodywork, putted in circulation in the middle 1960s until the middle 1990s. Double-decker buses were not a common vehicle for normal service, but for sightseeing purposes, most commonly Portuguese produced vehicles, including rebodies from regular service buses (for example, the Volvo B10R from Carristur), as well as ones from former companies, such as the MAN SD202 from BVG Berlin, many of them still in circulation. This situation with no double-decker buses on regular service lasted until 2011, when STCP acquired fifteen double-decker buses, with the model MAN A39 (same ones as in Berlin). They were presented as an event made by the company, named \\"Duplex Tour\\" at 26 February 2011 and put them into normal service on the 28th of the same month and year. These buses can be found normally on bus line 500. =Russia= MAN SD200 on route T-4 in Saint-Petersburg in 2000s Until 2011 double-decker buses were operating in the city of Barnaul. The double-decker fleet consisted of 7 MAN SD200 and MAN SD202 second hand buses imported from Berlin. Those buses were used on routes 3, 10 and 17. In the mid-1990s, some double-deckers were operated briefly in Saint Petersburg. =Spain= Bilbobus double deck bus in Bilbao, Spain Double-decker buses were introduced in 2014 in Bilbao by the city bus operator Bilbobus. They are not the first double deck vehicles in the city as ex-London Transport Q1 trolleybuses were sold to Bilbao after the end of London trolleybus operations in 1962 and were operated until the system's closure in 1978.Bilbao Picture Gallery http://www.trolleybus.net/index2.htm Initially, six vehicles are operating on Bilbobus route 56. They have a capacity of 132 passengers - 80 seated and fifty standing. =Sweden= VDL Synergy double- decker bus in Norrt√§lje, Sweden Sweden bought in 1965 50 Leyland Atlantean double-decker buses with Park Royal bodies. Leyland claimed they were the first double-decker buses with one man operation. They had two staircases and two pairs of doors. The Atlanteans were not replaced at the end of their revenue service life in 1974. Recently, however, in 2011 double-deckers returned to Sweden on revenue duties with VDL Synergy on in the SL 676 Stockholm √ñstra - Norrt√§lje line. Norrt√§lje is located around 70 km north of Stockholm. =Switzerland= In Switzerland Postauto operate double decker buses on a route between Engelburg‚ÄìSt Gallen‚ÄìHeiden routes and in the Obertoggenburg region and in the regions of Rorschach and Goldach. 19 Alexander Dennis Enviro500 have been ordered to operate on these services, which seat 80 passengers and can carry 48 standing. Four double deckers are also operated in Graub√ºnden which are due to be replaced within the next two years. =Turkey= In Turkey, the Istanbul public transit system (IETT) runs 89 double-decker buses on longer-distance routes, most notably commuter buses crossing the Bosphorus Bridge linking the European and the Asian sides of the city. Double-decker buses are also used on routes to and from Taksim Square to far-flung western suburbs such as B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece and Bahcesehir. Africa A double-decker bus in Alexandria, Egypt Double-decker buses can be found in several locations in Africa, such as Alexandria in Egypt and Johannesburg (Metrobus), City of Tshwane, and Cape Town (Golden Arrow Bus Services) in South Africa as well as Mombasa, Kenya. East Asia =Mainland China= Foton BJ6128SHEVCA-5 plug-in hybrid double-decker bus in Beijing Bus service Several cities in continental China have double-deckers in regular use on certain crowded lines, while some have a few double-deck buses in use on lines which also use single-deck vehicles, e.g. Nanning on line #704 in peak hours. Guilin is leading city that operate double-deckers regularly in major routes; in its main street the double-deckers prevails and run one-by-one almost every minute. Besides Guilin and Nanning, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Dalian, Foshan and Kunming also have those buses in service, particularly on routes during rush hours. Larger towns in the developed coastal provinces, including Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, use double-decker buses. =Hong Kong= The former British colony of Hong Kong introduced its first double-decker buses in 1949 by Kowloon Motor Bus. They have become very popular since then, and they are found in large numbers among the fleets of the territory's major bus operators (see below). By law, double- decker buses in Hong Kong are limited to a length of 12.8 metres (42 feet). Today, the majority of buses running in Hong Kong are double-decker buses, and all of them are air-conditioned. Also, Hong Kong has a double-deck trams system, one of three only in the world as of 2015 and the only fleet which is all double-deck. =Macau= In the former Portuguese territory of Macau, Fok Lei and its successor Transmac used second-hand double-deckers widely from the early 1970s until the late 1980s. =Taiwan= In early 1990s two tri-axle Leyland Olympians were evaluated in Taipei and Taichung. The evaluation was unsuccessful and the buses were sold to Hong Kong for spares. =Japan= A Mitsubishi Fuso Aero King arrived at Tokyo station as \\"Dream-go\\" in Japan A Neoplan Megaliner arrived at Osaka station as \\"Seishun Mega Dream\\" in Japan By Japanese law, vehicles are confined to maximum height and length. Japanese double-decker buses are mainly used for inter-city highway buses (i.e., motor coaches), city tours, and charter buses. In 1960, Kinki Sharyo and Hino Motors manufactured the first original double-decker bus \\"Vista Coach\\" for Kinki Nippon Railway (Kintetsu). In 1979, Chuo Kotsu, a chartered bus operator in Osaka, imported the Neoplan Skyliner. Skyliner, and the other imported buses: Van Hool Astromega TD824, Dr√∂gm√∂ller E440 Meteor, and a few MAN coaches inspired Japanese bus manufactures, who developed three domestic models in the mid-1980s: \\"Nissan Diesel Space Dream\\", \\"Hino Grand View\\" and \\"Mitsubishi Fuso Aero King\\". They did not, however, sell very well as the ceiling was only high. Nevertheless, Aero King was sold for 22 years, but, being unable to meet exhaust gas emission and safety levels, production stopped in 2005. In 1982, Toei Bus operated Neoplan Skyliners in Tokyo, between Asakusa and Ueno to 2001. Joban Kotsu operated Skyliners in a trans-Fukushima route: between Iwaki and Aizu-Wakamatsu via Koriyama from 1983 to 1996. Since the 1990s, JR Buses started to use Aero King for an overnight inter-city highway bus service named \\"Dream-go\\". The first Aero King in Dream-go, operated to \\"Fuku Fuku Tokyo\\" between Tokyo and Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi with Sanden Kotsu, which was replaced with a \\"super high-decker\\" coach in middle of the 1990s, \\"Fuku Fuku Tokyo,\\" and finally stopped in 2006. Japanese overnight highway buses are mainly equipped with a three-line, two-aisle (1+1+1) seat configuration with reclining seats. When this configuration is used on an ordinary coach, it has 28, 29 or 31 seats. When this configuration is used on a double-decker bus, it has 36 or 40 seats: the vehicle's price and capacity increase while operating cost decreases. JR Bus group mainly uses Aero King, Skyliner, and a few Jonckheere Monaco (equipped with Nissan Diesel engine) for inter-city highway bus operations between Kanto (near Tokyo) and Kansai (near Osaka), which is named \\"Dream-go\\" (overnight express) and \\"Hiru-tokkyu\\" (Daytime Express). The other bus operators, inspired by \\"Dream-go\\", increased use of the Aero King for overnight inter-city bus service. JR Bus Kanto imported four Neoplan Megaliner N128/4, leasing two to an operating partner (from 2003 to 2006, Kanto Railway, since 2006 Nishinihon JR Bus). The Megaliner is long, and has 84 seats (with 2+2 configuration), and is operated on an inter-city highway route between Tokyo and Tsukuba, Ibaraki from 2002 to 2005. The Megaliner has also been converted for a low-price overnight highway bus service between Tokyo and Osaka called \\"Seishun Mega Dream-go,\\" with special authorisation. =South Korea= In 2015, a fleet of 20 double-decker buses was introduced for commuters making the journey between the capital Seoul and its surrounding Gyeonggi Province and nearby Incheon city in 2015 as a pilot project. South Asia =Bangladesh= A double decker bus in Dhaka, Bangladesh The Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation operates a fleet of Ashok Leyland buses on the streets of Dhaka and Chittagong. Earlier, some Volvo B10M/Alexander buses also used to run in Dhaka, but most of those have been dumped recently. =India= A double decker bus in Mumbai, India In India, Hyderabad and Bangalore had double deckers for a while before discontinuing. Chennai's Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) had a small fleet of double-decker buses, mostly in the high-density, longer distance routes. They operated from 1975 before being wound up. They were briefly reintroduced in 1997 and were operated till 2008. Mumbai has operated double-decker buses since 1937. They are operated by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport undertaking. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation is operating double deckers in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi cities. Kolkata and also has double-decker buses. They are modelled on the London buses. Ashok Leyland Titan double decker buses are used in all cities. Articulated double-decker buses from Ashok Leyland were used till they were phased out in the early 1990s as they were thought to be unsuitable for city traffic. Recently in Kolkata, CSTC reintroduced double decker bus with music system on selected routes where wide road space was available, i.e. no over-head cables, low bridges or flyovers. CSTC has spent 1 million INR to renovate 1 bus. Today, double deckers exist only in Mumbai, Vadodara, Kolkata, Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. =Sri Lanka= AEC Routemaster in Sri Lanka In the 1950s, double-decker buses of the South Western Bus Company plied on the Galle Road in Colombo, Sri Lanka. These were taken over by the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) when all bus services were nationalised in 1958. Beginning around 1959, large numbers of second-hand double-decker buses of the RT, RTL and RTW classes were imported by the CTB from London Transport, and ran in their original red livery with the oval CTB logo painted on the sides. These buses were phased out beginning in the mid-1970s, and none remain in service. Later, around 1985, 40 ex-London Routemaster entered service. One Routemaster bus is run by the Sirasa TV and radio station. Today's buses in Sri Lanka include AEC Routemaster (Currently phased out in order to make way for Volvo B9TL/East Lancs Nordic and incoming First Western Dennis Trident 2/Plaxton President - 2001/02), MCW Metrobus (including 12m parts), Leyland Atlantean, and Dennis Trident 2 (1999/2000), plus some of the Volvo B7TL/East Lancs Vyking and Volvo B9TL/East Lancs Nordic buses. Southeast Asia =Indonesia= Jakarta double-decker city tour bus passing through landmarks and points of interest in Jakarta, Indonesia Indonesia first operated its double-decker bus fleet in 1968, with Leyland Titan double-decker bus first operated in Jakarta. The double-decker bus service linked Salemba in Central Jakarta with Blok M area in South Jakarta from 1968 to 1982. Between 1984 and 1996, the Jakarta municipal bus service, Perusahaan Umum Pengangkutan Penumpang Djakarta (Perum PPD) operated a fleet of 180 Volvo B55 double-decker buses, connecting various corners in the city. The double-decker bus service ceased to operate in 1996 due to aging fleet, lack of spare parts, and there are no plan to renew the double-decker fleet in Jakarta. By that time, the remnant of double-decker bus body were sold and repurposed as bus-themed clothing store in Blok M and restaurant in Senayan (now SCBD) area, but now the establishment has been demolished. By the early 2000s, the PPD has shifted their bus fleet from European built double-decker buses to cheaper second-hand Japanese buses and imported articulated buses from China. By that time, the double-decker seems to be lost in favour of articulated bus, which provides more exit and entry points to accommodate faster embarkment. By 2004 the TransJakarta bus rapid transit began its service in Jakarta, but uses no double-decker bus and chosen conventional and articulated buses instead. Since February 2014, the Jakarta Government provides free double-decker bus tours that offers sightseeing in Central Jakarta. The buses' route covers tourist attractions, such as Monas, Istiqlal Mosque, the Cathedral, National Museum, Sarinah, and Plaza Indonesia, as well as Grand Indonesia shopping centres. As 2016 there are 18 double-decker busses in Jakarta, and the service is expanded to include Kota Tua and Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Senayan area via Sudirman avenue. Other than the capital Jakarta, there are some cities in Indonesia that have operated double-decker buses, mostly as city sightseeing tour service. They are Bandung and Surakarta.Solo to operate rail bus and double decker Werkudoro Come to Solo The Bandros is a double-decker tourist bus operating in Bandung since 2014. =Malaysia= A Rapid KL Alexander Dennis Enviro500 during a test run in Cheras, Malaysia. Malaysia has historically seen the use of double-decker buses in mass transit to varying degrees, but were significantly limited in use due operational costs and driving spaces needed for such buses. Early double-decker municipal buses primarily existed in Malaya within the Kuala Lumpur area of Selangor and George Town, Penang between the late 1940s and the early 1960s, when double-deckers were eventually withdrawn in favour of cheaper and more agile single-deck buses. The earliest recorded use of double- deckers by Malayan bus companies was in Selangor in 1948 when the Toong Fong Omnibus Company acquired two Park Royal-built Guy Arab IIIs at a cost of M$40,000 each; the General Transport Company (GTC) followed by acquiring Park Royal-built AEC Regent IIIs. While the buses saw service for over a decade, all of them were taken out of service for a variety of reasons and were never replaced with new double-deckers; the buses were often obstructed by narrow streets, trees, low bridges, and increasing overhead wires, while passengers eventually favoured staying on the lower deck of the bus; the cost of operating the buses was also higher due to a local vehicle tax calculated based on the number of seats of a taxed vehicle. One Toong Fong double-decker was burned in the late-1950s by communist insurgents, while the remaining double-deckers were ultimately disused by the mid-1960s due to age. The successor of the GTC, Sri Jaya, experimented with a reintroduction of double- deckers in 1989 by leasing a Singapore-assembled, 102-seat Leyland Olympian for use within Kuala Lumpur for 6 months, but found that street conditions were problematic as before and discontinued the use of the bus after the trial. In George Town, Penang, five retired AEC C1-type double-decker trolleybuses were procured in 1956 by the George Town Municipal Tramways from London Transport as an experiment for the possible use of double-decker buses in George Town. Poor performance results and the advancing ages of the buses, coupled with efforts to replace the entire trolleybus fleet with single-deck diesel-powered buses in the 1960s, led to the withdrawal of the only double- deck buses in early Penangite public transport. Following increasing public bus ridership, more open roadways and the feasibility of operating double-deck Hop-On Hop-Off tourist buses within Kuala Lumpur, Prasarana Malaysia purchased 40 (revised from an earlier 111) Alexander Dennis Enviro500 double-decker buses in 2014 to serve high volume Rapid KL Rapid Bus routes; with a capacity of 108 passengers each, it is double that of a contemporary single-deck bus in the fleet. The first five buses of the batch entered service in September 2015; with the rest of the fleet gradually added into service in the following months. Feasibility studies were also conducted by Prasarana Malaysia on the reintroduction of double-deckers in Penang through Rapid Penang's bus service in 2015. Beyond mass transit, double-deckers have seen widespread use as long- distance coaches since the late-2000s in response to growing demand for intercity travel, as expressways and outlying bus stops lack physical obstacles that plagued urban bus services. =Singapore= An ex-SBS Transit Leyland Olympian 3-axle bus as preserved in the UK after its retirement from Singapore in 2013 MAN A95 is one of the newest double-decker buses purchased for the Bus Contracting Model. In October 1953, a single AEC Regent III double-decker from the fleet of the Kuala Lumpur-based General Transport Company was sent to Singapore for demonstration. It was used on service by the Singapore Traction Company for two weeks. After that, it was inspected by two Chinese-owned bus companies, and then sent back to Kuala Lumpur. However, no orders for double-deckers immediately followed. Although Sentosa was already operating several ex-London double decker buses such as the AEC Regent III RT and the Leyland Titan RTL from 1975 to the early 1980s,* double-decker buses only made a major comeback in Singapore's public bus system on 13 June 1977 when Singapore Bus Service (SBS, present-day SBS Transit), introduced 20 Leyland Atlantean AN68 buses on route 86 which was launched by then-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Communications Ong Teng Cheong that day. The success of the 1977 Leyland Atlantean buses led to SBS purchasing another 500 Leyland Atlantean AN68 buses from 1978 up to 1984 while also trialing several demonstrators such as the Volvo B55, Dennis Dominator, Scania BR112DH and Volvo B10MD Citybus concurrently. The next batch of double-deck buses was introduced from 1984 to 1986 and consists of the Mercedes-Benz O305 and the Leyland Olympian, both of which were bodied by Walter Alexander Coachbuilders with an R-type body. In 1993, the first air-conditioned 12-metre (as opposed to the average 10.5-metre length then) double-decker bus, the Leyland Olympian 3-axle was launched as the \\"Superbus\\". The original 200 \\"Superbuses\\" were followed by an additional 471 Volvo Olympian 3-axle \\"Superbuses\\" and 100 non air-conditioned Volvo Olympian buses from 1994 to 2000. The Volvo B10TL, the first stepless, ultra-low-floor \\"Superbus\\", was launched in 1999 while 20 low- floor Dennis Trident 3 buses followed in 2001. The first wheelchair-accessible double-decker buses, the Volvo B9TL, were introduced in 2006; by 2014, SBS Transit had over 1631 of these buses in service. SBS Transit's monopoly on double-decker buses in Singapore ended in 2014 when rival SMRT Buses ordered 201 Alexander Dennis Enviro500 buses. It was followed up with 16 MAN ND323F A95 buses in 2015. Some of the existing double-deckers owned by SMRT Buses and SBS Transit were transferred to new operators Tower Transit and Go-Ahead under the Bus Contracting Model. Subsequent orders of B9TL and A95 buses are being made by the Land Transport Authority, are painted in a lush green livery (rather than the operator-specific liveries of SMRT and SBS Transit), and are used by all operators. Currently, there are more than 3,000 double-decker buses in Singapore, all of which are air-conditioned and the majority wheelchair-accessible. Newer units introduced from 2018 onwards are also Euro VI-compliant and are equipped with USB charging ports and Visual Passenger Information Displays. In March 2017, the first three-door, two-staircase 12.8m long double-decker bus in Singapore was introduced by Tower Transit with the registration plate SG5999Z for a six-month trial period. After the trial, the bus was transferred to SBS Transit. The trial was successful and the Land Transport Authority purchased another 100 3-door double decker buses of the Alexander Dennis Enviro500 and MAN A95 builds in April 2019.100 Three-door Double-Decker Buses Procured by LTA Land Transport Guru 25 April 2019 In April 2018, SBS Transit introduced into service a single Volvo B8L registered as SG4003D. Fully electric Yutong E12DD double-decker buses will also be introduced by 2020. Outside public bus operations, open-top buses are also operated by Big Bus Tours. The New Routemaster from London also visited Singapore twice; once in 2014 and another in 2016. =Philippines= A double- decker bus of Pabama Transport in Cagayan de Oro Presently double-decker buses are used by the Mall of Asia Arena (Higer KLQ6119GSE3 B91H-series) and the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (King Long XMQ6110GS). Former operators were Manila Motor Company (Matorco), which introduced such buses to the Philippines, and the Metro Manila Transit Corporation (Leyland Atlantean). The first double-decker bus in decades to serve the riding public in the capital region debuted in January 2016, serving the SM City North EDSA-Ayala Center route. It also sports PWD and elderly sitting, a national first. In the entirety of Visayas and Mindanao region, Pabama Transport based in Bukidnon province in northern Mindanao was the first bus line to deploy double decker buses (Zhongtong LCK6148H Giant Magnate) which started servicing the riding public in June 2018. It was also the first in the country to field double- decker buses for provincial operations.Double-decker safe for Bukidnon, firm says =Thailand= Double deckers are also commonly found in Thailand nowadays. Previously there are Volvo B10M with Alexander bodies available. =Vietnam= The first two double decker buses were used for route 06 of Ho Chi Minh City since 3 December 2005 in green color, like many HCMC buses at that time. There were rumors in May 2019 that these two buses will cease their operation, but Head of HCMC Department of Transportation confirmed that the buses will remain in service.https://dantri.com.vn/xa-hoi/bac-thong-tin-ngung- hoat-dong-xe-buyt-2-tang-dau-tien-o-sai-gon-20190525124242943.htm West Asia =Iraq= Double-decker bus in Baghdad, Iraq. First used in 1938 and continued until 2003. They became part of the Iraqi culture and resumed operating in Baghdad in 2013 with modern buses. A fare can't reach more than 45 U.S. cents or 500 Iraqi Dinars. The double-decker buses in Baghdad were the first to enter the Middle East and the Arabic world. =Israel= In Israel, Egged operated double-decker buses from 1984 to 2013.Here and below: First double-decker (built by Neoplan) arrived to Israel on 26 August 1984, and during the trial period it performed 434 test drives on four different lines, passed 195583 kilometers and gathered public attention and interest. Double- deckers were found commercially attractive, and in 1988 an agreement between Egged and Neoplan was signed, ordering first 20 buses, with additional 30 buses ordered in the following year. The double-deckers started to arrive in 1989, and they worked on lines Tel-Aviv‚ÄîJerusalem, Tel-Aviv‚ÄîHaifa, Tel- Aviv‚ÄîBe'er Sheba and on Eilat lines. However, both technical problems (in connection between the engine and the transmission) and religious issues (Haredi Jews had problems with women sitting above and in front of them) led to gradual decline in use of these double-deckers. They were removed from the last major line operating them, the Tel-Aviv‚ÄîJerusalem line (480), in the end of the 1990s, worked for some time on local lines in the Shfela region, and in the beginning of 2000s were finally removed from service. Some of the buses were sold to an auto dealer from Jordan, who in turn sold them to Iraq and other countries of the Persian gulf. In August 2005, three double-deckers returned to service on line 99 \\"Scenic route\\" in Jerusalem. These 3 buses were assembled from parts of 7 double-deckers that were still in storage. The operational cost for double-deckers gradually grew beyond the limit when repairs were still attractive, which led to their final removal from service in 2013. =Kuwait= In the 1980s KPTC took a number of Leyland Atlantean's. Since Deregulation one of the other main bus operators Kuwait Citybus re- introduced 56 double deckers built by King Long in 2017. =United Arab Emirates= 170 Neoplan double deckers are in operation in Dubai North America =Canada= An Alexander Dennis Enviro500 equipped with bike rack, servicing Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. In 2000, the cities of Victoria and Kelowna, British Columbia placed an order for 10 Dennis Trident 3 buses imported from the United Kingdom, becoming the first cities in North America to use modern double-decker buses in their public transit systems. Several more orders have been placed since then,Bus fleet getting 16 more double- deckers and as of 2017 BC Transit operates 69 double-decker buses, including Trident 3s and the newer Alexander Dennis Enviro500s, of which 62 operate on the Victoria Regional Transit System and the remaining 7 with the Kelowna Regional Transit System. In Victoria, the buses are mainly used on routes that go from downtown to the suburbs, and to the Swartz Bay Ferry Terminal near Sidney, B.C. They can also be found on routes that head to the University of Victoria and the Western Communities, and have proven to be very popular amongst both locals and tourists. TransLink, the transit authority of Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, tested 2 Enviro500 buses on lines 301, 311, 351, 354, 555, 601 and 620 between November 2017 and March 2018. It was announced soon after that 32 double-deckers will be purchased, arriving in 2019. On 30 October 2019, TransLink's first double-decker bus made its first ever run along route 620 from the Bridgeport station in Richmond to the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal. From March 2009 to June 2012, three imported Alexander Dennis Enviro500 double-decker buses similar to those in Victoria were used on OC Transpo express routes on the Transitway in Ottawa, Ontario. Delivered in November 2008, these buses proved to be efficient in reducing costs, but their height prohibited their use on many routes. Consequently, these three buses were withdrawn and sold to Victoria in late 2012 after a new series of 75 Enviro500 buses with a lower height that met MTO regulations entered service earlier that year. As of 2018 OC Transpo has 133 of these buses. One of GO Transit's Super-Lo double-decker buses GO Transit, a regional transit system serving the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario is the largest user of double- decker buses in Canada, with over 150 such vehicles in service as of 2017. Its fleet comprises Alexander Dennis Enviro500s in a single-door, commuter-type configuration similar to its fleet of highway coaches. The first 22 entered service between 2008 and 2009, with its roof height limiting usage to the Highway 407 corridor. 105 additional buses were delivered between 2012 and 2015 and feature a lower roof height of . The latest series of 253 buses, which is currently built in a local factory in Vaughan, has a roof height of and is expected to replace most of the single-decker coach fleet by 2020, at which point 75% of the active fleet is expected to be composed of double- deckers. Strathcona County Transit of Strathcona County, Alberta started a pilot project in September 2010 which explored using different high-capacity bus types to carry more passengers on high-demand commuter routes between Strathcona County and Edmonton. This involved a one-year lease of an Alexander Dennis Enviro500 from the manufacturer.http://strathcona.ab.ca/departments/Transit/6563.aspx After completing a year of testing between September 2010 and October 2011, a firm order of 14 Enviro500s was placed in 2013 for their service between Sherwood Park and downtown Edmonton, with the first arriving in late August. Five more buses were ordered in 2016, bringing the fleet of double-deckers to 19 as of 2017. Strathcona County Transit currently has 24 Enviro500s in their fleet. =Mexico= Alexander Dennis Enviro500 MMC double-decker bus on Mexico City Metrob√∫s' new line 7 running along Calzada de los Misterios The Mexico City Metrob√∫s bus rapid transit system started operating a fleet of 90 Alexander Dennis Enviro500s on its new line 7, along the city's iconic boulevard, Paseo de la Reforma, in February 2018. =Panama= At least one double-decker bus is among those used on the Panama City-Col√≥n route. =United States= A Van Hool US-specification double-decker bus in New York City, U.S. With the exception of coaches, double-decker buses are uncommon in the United States. Many private operators, such as Megabus, run by Coach USA, employs double- decker buses on its busier intercity routes. For publicly run transport, articulated buses are generally preferred. Nonetheless, a handful of municipal operators use double-decker buses, primarily on the West Coast. In Davis, California, Unitrans, the student-run bus company of University of California, Davis, operates six double-decker buses imported from London. One of these buses has been converted to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). There was also the prototype GX-1 Scenicruiser of Greyhound Lines, which enters from the first floor: the second floor contains the driver's compartment and more seats. Citizens Area Transit, the transit authority in the Las Vegas, Nevada area, introduced a fleet of double-deckers to serve the Las Vegas Strip route in October 2005. The route is branded as \\"The Deuce\\". As of 2009 it serviced eight lines. In Snohomish County, Washington, Community Transit operates 45 Alexander Dennis Enviro500 double-decker buses, which are used on commuter routes between Snohomish County and Seattle. An initial order of 23 buses went into service in 2011, and a second order of 17 went into service in 2015. Sound Transit, another operator in the Seattle area, bought five double-decker buses through a Community Transit order and began operating their own fleet in 2015. In 2016, a joint procurement between three transit agencies in Washington state ordered additional double-decker buses from Alexander Dennis. Community Transit would order 17 buses, with an option for 40, Sound Transit would receive 32 with an option for 43, and Kitsap Transit would buy 11 of their own. As of 1/1/2020, Community Transit owns 52 and Sound Transit owns 37. Community transit purchased 23 in 2010 (10800-10822), 22 in 2015(15800-15821), and 8 in 2019(19850-19857). Sound transit purchased 5 in 2015(91501-91505) and another 32 in 2017(91701-91732). One of the 10800s has been retired, bringing the total for Community Transit from 53 to 52. A Community Transit double-decker bus in Downtown Seattle, Washington In San Luis Obispo, California, SLO Transit tested a double-decker bus in late 2008 to see if it would alleviate the over-crowdedness of Route 4. The borrowed bus has been returned, and SLO Transit has purchased one double-decker bus of its own using a combination of Federal, State and local funding. The bus went into operation on 8 September 2010.San Luis Obispo Deputy Director of Public Works, Tim Bochum, 9 July 2010 In Los Angeles County, California, the Antelope Valley Transit Authority uses double-decker buses as part of its commuter service to the Los Angeles area. Also in Los Angeles, SCRTD used Neoplan AN 122/3 Skyliners double-decker buses from the late 70s until 1993. New York City phased out double-decker buses in 1960. They briefly returned from 1976 to 1978, although they only ran in Manhattan. In 2008 the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) briefly ran a Van Hool double-decker buse on several express routes. However, that year's financial crisis meant the end of the trial period. In 2018, the MTA tested another double decker bus, an Alexander Dennis Enviro500 SuperLo, on the X17J express bus route between Manhattan and Staten Island. However, the MTA has no current plans to purchase double decker buses. In San Francisco, California, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency operated one Alexander Dennis double-decker bus as a demonstrator between 12 December 2007 and 8 January 2008. The bus was running on some high capacity routes as trial. In California, AC Transit began experimental use of a double-decker bus on the commuter route between Fremont, California and Stanford University in 2015. On 3 December 2018 the company introduced double-deckers on its FS and J routes from Berkeley to San Francisco, and later added routes L and LA serving Richmond, El Sobrante, San Pablo and Albany. https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/ac-transit- transbay-bus-double-decker-price-fare-13447719.php Oceania =Australia= Bustech-bodied double decker in Sydney, Australia Leyland Titan double decker bus in Sydney, Australia Double-decker buses plied route services in Sydney from the 1920s until 1986. Popular makers included AEC, Albion and Leyland. Disputes over one-man operation of double-deckers led to the phasing-out of this configuration. Double-deckers were thereafter limited to charter and tourist services. Double-decker buses were reintroduced to the Sydney area in 2012, with Busways operating regular services from Blacktown to Rouse Hill, in Sydney's north-west. These were expanded in 2013, to traverse routes from Castle Hill and the Northern Beaches to Sydney's CBD. The B-Line service uses an exclusive fleet of double-decker buses.New B-Line to transform Northern Beaches Bus travel Transport for NSW 9 November 2015Mike Baird's B-Line rapid bus routes for northern beaches Sydney Morning Herald 9 November 2015Thousands of new transport services starting at a stop, wharf and station near you Transport for NSW 15 October 2017 Double-decker buses were also reintroduced to Melbourne to operate between Werribee, Wyndham Vale and Tarneit railway stations in 2015 using buses made in Melbourne. =New Zealand= Northern Busway bus at Albany Busway Station Until 2013‚Äì14, double decker buses were used only by tour operators and for long-distance coach services operated by Intercity Coachlines and Manabus. They were not used for public transport on urban routes. In the 1970s a number of former London double decker buses were imported for museums, such as the Museum of Transport and Technology who used AEC Regent Low Height (RLH) buses to connect museum sites and for charters. Sydney double decker and more London buses of various models (AEC Regent III RT, AEC Routemasters etc.) were imported by charter and tourist operators and slowly became more commonplace. Bridge heights and shop verandas restricted the use of double deckers around New Zealand until congestion and high public transport use required some innovative solutions. A single double-decker bus arrived in Auckland in early March 2013 for a trial, with more planned to arrive in 2014 if the trial proved successful. The Scania K320UD bus, operated by Ritchies Transport, began revenue service on 11 March 2013 on the well- patronised Northern Express services on the Northern Busway between Albany and Britomart in downtown Auckland. In addition, NZ Bus and Howick & Eastern investigated the use of double-decker buses on the Dominion Road, Mount Eden Road, and Botany to downtown routes. By May 2016, double deckers were running on the busway and on many other Auckland urban routes, operated by several companies, with more to be introduced. Four 87-seat DesignLine double deckers started on Waikato services in 2018. Since 15 July 2018, double deckers, including some fully electric models, have been operating in Wellington. There are currently 51 diesel double deckers running and 10 electric ones. 34 of the diesel double deckers are euro 6, while the remaining 17 are euro 5. South America =Argentina= In Argentina, double-decker buses are the second most widely used means of transport for long-distance trips in Argentina, only after aeroplanes. Argentina is a very large country, and most trips take a large amount of time, so long-distance bus companies offer high quality services which include waiters, hot and cold beverages and regular food. For very long-distance trips, most companies offer buses with large seats that can be pulled back and be shaped into a bed. Double-decker buses are also used by tourists in Buenos Aires where they're used in city-tours. =Bolivia= In Bolivia, double-deck buses are a common means of transportation for long- distance trips between large cities such as department capitals. These buses also connect Bolivia with different countries. The double deck buses travel to Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Chile. The buses are equipped with toilets, and several companies offer buses with large seats called Leito (Bus Cama) that can be pulled back and be shaped into a bed. =Brazil= Double-decker buses are common in long-distance services interstate and international (as destined for Argentina and Paraguay). It is possible to see VIP double-decker buses also connecting cities in the same state, such as S√£o Paulo City, Sao Jose do Rio Preto and Ribeirao Preto. Inside these buses there are one TV for each person and boarding service for example. Open double-decker are used for city tours (such as Rio de Janeiro and Bahia). In S√£o Paulo, there was an experience of use for urban services in the 80s, but without success due to problems with the height of the vehicle. These buses are fabricated in Brazil and exported to many countries. =Ecuador= A Double-decker bus in front of the Presidential Palace in the Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO Double-decker buses are used in city-tours in Quito, Cuenca and parts of the coast. They are very popular in the touristic district of the Historic District in Quito. Double-decker buses are common on long distance interurban trips. =Chile= Double-decker buses are common in long distance interurban trips. Open top double-decker are used in city-tours. On 9 March 2017, the British Embassy in Chile made a deal with the Public Transport Ministry in Santiago to try double-deckers for public transport.http://santiagotimes.cl/2017/03/09/photos-double-decker-buses- coming-to-santiago/ On that day the first bus was tested on Santiago roads. On 26 February 2019, it was announced that another type of double-decker bus will start to be used in a particular route in Central Santiagohttps://www.emol.com/noticias/Nacional/2019/02/26/939232/Como-es-el- nuevo-bus-de-dos-pisos-que-circulara-por-Santiago.html =Peru= Double- decker buses are common on long distance interurban trips to main cities of the country. Open top double-deckers are used in city tours in downtown Lima and in the tourist district of Miraflores. Pio Delgado Arguedas bought 300 Greyhound buses and was the distributor of the buses in South America and Mexico. He also created TEPSA, and was the owner for years until he sold his company. Triple-decker buses Knight Bus There have been attempts to build a triple-decker bus. However such vehicles are problematic in that the high centre of gravity leads to instability and there is the risk of hitting trees or bridges. In almost all models the third level was a small compartment in the rear part of the bus, such as a triple-decker capable of carrying eighty- eight people from Rome to Tivoli in 1932 or the General American Aerocoach 3 Decker Bus of 1952. The only three-decker with a full-length third level ever built is the Knight Bus created by John Richardson for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban cutting up two AEC Regent III RTs and putting them together. Although the AEC was merely a prop made by a special effects team for a movie, a British built ECW bodied Bristol VR double-decker bus imitation of the Knight bus was a functioning bus, which even went on tour. Comparison with articulated buses Double-decker buses may be particularly popular along tourist-friendly routes, such as this First Kernow open-top bus in Cornwall, England Operators worldwide must often decide between articulated and double- decker buses on popular routes. Articulated buses, entirely on one level, offer more room for disabled passengers, luggage and pushchairs; they may also be needed on routes going under low bridges or weak bridges that cannot take high axle loads. Double-decker buses, however, have a smaller road footprint and as such disrupt traffic, or block turning lanes less than articulated buses. Double-decker buses may be more popular with passengers because of the better view, and with cyclists, who may be at less risk than they are with the unpredictable swing of an articulated bus's tail. Articulated buses normally offer more standing room while double-decker buses may sometimes (not always) offer more seats. Articulated buses have less dwell time because of the extra doors, and double-decker buses offer fewer chances for fare dodgers since there are fewer or no unmanned doors. Collisions with bridges There have been a significant number of incidents in which a double-decker bus has collided with a low bridge, often a railway bridge. This is often caused by the driver making a wrong turn, driving a route they are unfamiliar with, or being used to driving single-decker buses and forgetting to allow for their vehicle's extra height when driving a double-decker. A collision with a railroad bridge by a Megabus in September 2010 at Syracuse, New York killed four passengers and injured 17. In recent years in the United Kingdom, six people had minor injuries after their bus hit a railway bridge at Stockport in July 2013. A bus collided with a railway bridge at Sileby, Leicestershire in June 2014. An empty bus had its roof removed after hitting a railway bridge in Birkenhead in December 2014. In March 2015, a bus carrying 76 children hit a bridge at Staines, Surrey. Eleven passengers were taken to hospital but none were seriously injured. In the same month, an empty bus had its roof removed after hitting a railway bridge in Isleworth West London. A Stagecoach Highlands bus collided with a railway bridge at Balloch, Highland, Scotland in April 2015. There were no casualties, one top-deck passenger narrowly escaped injury by throwing himself to the floor. A bus operated by Bluestar had its roof removed after colliding with a railway bridge at Romsey in May 2015. An incident in July 2015 in Norwood, London also resulted in the removal of the bus' roof; seven people were injured. Similar incidents occurred in September 2015 in Rochdale, Greater Manchester (seventeen were injured) and in Bournemouth in April 2016, with all thirty passengers escaping without injury. On 11th September 2020, a bus carrying 72 children hit a bridge, taking the complete roof off, in Winchester, Hampshire, on the way to school. Three children were seriously injured and required surgury whilst a further 12 suffered minor injuries.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- hampshire-54116518 The bus was operated by Stagecoach South. In popular culture The alt= *In the film Summer Holiday, Cliff Richard and friends drive a double-decker bus fitted out as a caravan across Europe. *In Live and Let Die, Roger Moore as James Bond, drives one being chased. The chase involving the double-decker bus was filmed with a former London bus adapted by having the top sliced off, then put back in place running on ball bearings to allow it to slide away from the undercarriage on impact with a low bridge. The stunts involving the bus were performed by Maurice Patchett, a London Transport bus driving instructor. *A double deck bus also featured at the end of the final episode of the sitcom The Young Ones. *The British sitcom On the Buses featured double deckers, driven by Stan Butler (portrayed by Reg Varney). *In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the aforementioned Knight Bus is a triple-decker bus which can fit under bridges due to magic. *During the 2012 Summer Olympics, Czech artist David ƒåern√Ω presented his moving sculpture named London Booster, a full-sized \\"London double-decker bus\\" (actually ex-Southern Vectis from the Isle of Wight) permanently doing push- ups with hydraulic-powered human-like arms. This was an accompanying installation outside temporarily Czech Olympic House in London borough of Islington. *The double decker bus was also a star in a Saturday morning TV series titled Here Come the Double Deckers in the 1970s. *A double decker bus was featured on an episode of Doctor Who. *The British television series Thomas & Friends features an anthropomorphic AEC Bridgemaster named Bulgy, a character infamous for his dislike for railways. He deems roads superior to rail traffic, and often tells lies or sabotages the railways to make the roads flourish.

(2008). Dictionnaire des orientalistes de langue fran√ßaise, p. 810. R√©musat studied medicine as a young man, but his discovery of a Chinese herbal treatise enamored him with the Chinese language, and he spent five years teaching himself to read it. After publishing several well-received articles on Chinese topics, a chair in Chinese was created at the Coll√®ge de France in 1814 and R√©musat was placed in it. Life and career R√©musat was born in Paris on 5 September 1788 and was educated for the medical profession, earning a doctorate in medicine in 1813.Honey (2001): 26. While studying medicine, R√©musat discovered a Chinese herbal treatise in the collection of the Abb√© Tersan and was immediately fascinated by it. He taught himself to read it by tirelessly studying the traditional Chinese dictionary Zh√®ngz«ê t≈çng. In 1811, at the end of five years of study, he produced the work Essai sur la langue et la litt√©rature chinoises (Essay on Chinese language and literature), and a paper on foreign languages among the Chinese, which procured him the patronage of Silvestre de Sacy. In 1813, R√©musat published an essay in Latin on the nature of Chinese characters and Classical Chinese entitled \\"Utrum Lingua Sinica sit vere monosyllabica? Disputatio philologica, in qua de Grammatica Sinica obiter agiture; autore Abelo de Remusat\\". R√©musat's early publications established his reputation in the academic community, and on November 29, 1814, a chair in Chinese was created for him at the Coll√®ge de France.Honey (2001): 26-7. This date, or, alternatively, the date of his inaugural lecture (January 16, 1815), has been termed \\"the birth-year of [academic] sinology.\\"Honey (2001): 27. R√©musat's course in Chinese at the Coll√®ge de France focused on lectures on grammar and the study of classical texts such as the Hallowed Documents (Sh√†ngsh≈´), the Laozi (Dao De Jing), the Nestorian Stele, and both Chinese and Manchu editions of the accounts of the life of Confucius.Honey (2001): 27-8. His lecture notes were eventually edited into book form, modeled on Joseph de Pr√©mare's earlier grammar, and published in 1822 as √âl√©mens de la grammaire chinoise, ou Principes g√©n√©raux du Kou-wen ou style antique, et du Kouan-hou, c'est-√†-dire, de la language commune g√©n√©ralement usit√©e dans l'empire chinois (Elements of Chinese Grammar, or General Principles of G«îw√©n or Ancient Style, and of GuƒÅnhu√†, that is to say, the Common Language Generally Used in the Chinese Empire).Honey (2001): 28. This work was the first scientific exposition of the Chinese language in Europe, and was later praised by Henri Maspero as \\"the first [work] in which the grammar was isolated to take account of the proper spirit of the Chinese language, and not just as a translation exercise where all the grammatical forms of the European languages [...] imposed their individual patterns.\\"Henri Maspero, \\"La Chaire de Langues et Litt√©ratures chi noises et tartares- mandchoues\\", cited in Honey (2001): 28. R√©musat became an editor of the Journal des savants in 1818, and founder and first secretary of the Soci√©t√© asiatique at Paris in 1822; he also held various Government appointments. In 1826, R√©musat published Iu-kiao-li, ou les deux cousines, roman chinois (Yu Jiao Li, titled in English as Iu-kiao-li: or, the Two Fair Cousins), one of the first Chinese novels known in Europe (the Chinese original is a minor work, though). It was read by Thomas Carlyle, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Goethe and Stendhal. A list of his works is given in Qu√©rard's France litt√©raire s.v. R√©musat. His letters to Wilhelm von Humboldt are also of interest. Around 1830 R√©musat was commissioned to inventory the Chinese items held in the French Royal Library, which inspired him to begin a translation of the bibliographical sections of the Wenxian tongkao to assist European scholars in studying Chinese scholarship.Honey (2001): 29. He completed the first volume, \\"Classics\\", in 1832, but contracted cholera and died before it was printed. R√©musat is buried along with his wife Jenny Lecamus - the daughter of Jean Lecamus, a former mayor of Paris - near the church of St. Fargeau in Saint- Fargeau-Ponthierry, Seine-et-Marne.

He was born in B√ºhlertann and died at the age of 87 in his hometown Horb am Neckar, Baden- W√ºrttemberg. In 1890 Josef Schneider was granted a patent by royal warrant from the King of W√ºrttemberg to become the first German electricity producer. The next year, together with Ernst Werner von Siemens, he made significant improvements to the dynamo. In 1892 Germany saw its first electric light with the help of a steam turbine developed by Josef Schneider Sr. The first electricity was sold to the Hohenzollern royal family. Two years later (1894), a fire destroyed the original generating plant, motivating construction of the first private hydro-electric power plant in Horb am Neckar (Black Forest). By 1912, he and Oskar von Miller were the first to connect eleven cities in the Stuttgart-Munich region to an electric grid using high-voltage lines. In 1922, he assisted in the development of the Voith-Francis Turbine. 1970s In 1975, the family firm, Elektrizit√§tswerk Horb KG, was incorporated and granted an electricity monopoly for generation, transmission, and sale of electricity to southwestern Baden-W√ºrttemberg. It continued to be owned by the Schneider family. In 1980 Josef Schneider Jr. helped to develop the Ossberg- Streamturbine. Schneider Power The Elektrizit√§tswerk Horb am Neckar KG was sold to EnBW (formerly, Energie Versorgung Schwaben) in 1985. In 2004 Thomas Schneider, the great great grandson of Josef Schneider, founded Schneider Power Inc. (TSXV:SNE), a publicly listed Company on the TSX Venture Exchange and one of Canada's largest wind power producers, with wind turbines operating in Germany, the United States, and Canada. In 2009 Schneider Power was acquired by Irvine California-based, Quantum Fuel Systems Technologies Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ:QTWW).

Calydoniaca and The Rape of Helen The Suda (K 1951) adds that he was the author of a Calydoniaca in six books, doubtless an account of the Calydonian boar hunt, Persica, probably an encomium on emperor Anastasius composed at the end of the Persian wars, and Encomia, or laudatory poems. The Suda does not mention \\"The Abduction of Helen\\". All works mentioned in the Suda are lost, but his poem in 392 hexameters on The Abduction of Helen (·ºâœÅœÄŒ±Œ≥·Ω¥ ·ºôŒªŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ) is still extant, having been discovered by Cardinal Bessarion in Calabria. The Abduction opens with an invocation to the nymphs of the Troad whom the poet asks for information about Paris as the originator of the Trojan conflict (1-16), followed by the account of how the gods attended the wedding of Thetis and Peleus, how they forgot to invite Eris, who searched for retaliation throwing a golden apple amongst the gods (17-63); Hera, Athena and Aphrodite all want to have it and Zeus orders Hermes to take the three goddesses to visit the handsome shepherd Paris, who should award the apple to one of them (64-79); the goddesses enhance their appearances before meeting up the shepherd, with Aphrodite launching a speech on her court of Erotes (80-100). Paris, more interested in playing the pipes than in taking care of his sheep, receives from Hermes the assignment to award the apple to the most beautiful goddess (101-30); submitting to his eyes, Athena offers him courage and victory in war, Hera to make him lord of all Asia, and Aphrodite, baring her breasts, the hand of Helen (131-65); Paris awards the apple to Aphrodite, who scorns Hera and Athena, and prepares his trip to Sparta to seduce Helen (166-200). The trip to Sparta begins with bad presages, but his fleet reaches Sparta without hazards and he sets towards the town on foot (201-46). Helen opens the door to him and, instantly attracted towards him, initiates a dialogue with him: Paris tells her that he is the son of Priam, king of Troy, and that Aphrodite promised him to make him Helen‚Äôs spouse (247-302). Helen agrees to elope with Paris and they do so during the night (303-25). Hermione wakes up the following morning and searches for her mother, considering the possibilities that she got lost in the mountains or was drowned in the river (326-62). She falls asleep exhausted and sees her mother in her dreams telling her that she was abducted by the foreigner who visited them the previous day (363-79). Hermione calls her father to return, while on seeing the arrival of the couple from the walls of Troy Cassandra sheds her veil and tears her hair (380-92). The poem, described in 1911 as \\"dull and tasteless, devoid of imagination, a poor imitation of Homer, and [having] little to recommend it except its harmonious versification, based upon the technical rules of Nonnus\\", has been more recently evaluated as a \\"short and charming miniature epic\\".Jasper Griffin, 2010, 'Greek Epic' in Catherine Bates, ed., The Cambridge Companion to the Epic, p. 28. Printed editions The first printed edition was by Aldus Manutius, Venice, possibly in 1505. suggested probably about 1521.

The serial is set on the fictional English island of Fang Rock. In the serial, a shapeshifting alien scout called a Rutan arrives on Earth intending to use the planet as a strategic base in the Rutans' war against the Sontarans. Plot On the way to show Brighton to Leela, the TARDIS lands on the island of Fang Rock off the south coast of England in the early 20th century. Noticing that the lighthouse isn't functioning properly, the Fourth Doctor decides to investigate, as well as to ask for directions, as the TARDIS seems to have got 'lost in the fog'. Upon arrival at the lighthouse, and after introducing themselves, the Doctor discovers the dead body of one of the keepers, Ben. The other two keepers, old superstitious Reuben and the keen young Vince Hawkins, report that a light fell from the sky near the island. They also explain the electricity flow to the lamp on the lighthouse has become erratic and the Doctor deduces something is feeding on the flow. Reuben does not help matters with his constant references to the mythical Beast of Fang Rock, which reputedly once terrorised the lighthouse. As the Doctor and Leela explore, something moves Ben's body out of the lighthouse and onto the island, and they witness a curious electric crackling which seems to have killed fish nearby. The loss of the electric light due to the unexplained draining of power from the generators causes a luxury yacht to crash on to Fang Rock. The four survivors are brought to the lighthouse: the bosun Harker; Colonel James Skinsale MP; the owner, Lord Palmerdale; and his highly strung secretary Adelaide Lessage. Over time it emerges Palmerdale has bought government secrets from Skinsale and was desperate to reach the stock exchange to make a killing ‚Äì hence the reason the ship was travelling at such a pace. Harker and the Doctor retrieve Ben's body and the Time Lord deduces it has been used as an anatomy lesson for an alien life form. He determines that their best protection is to secure the lighthouse to keep the creature out. Reuben then disappears for a time and then reappears a changed man, which the others put down to shock. But the pattern of death now speeds up. Palmerdale is killed in the lamp room by a glowing alien presence on the outside of the lighthouse, and then Harker is killed when Reuben corners him in the boiler room. From the alien light emanating from Reuben it is clear he has become possessed or transformed by the alien creature. The Doctor finds Harker's body and then Reuben's own ‚Äì the latter cold for some time ‚Äì which means the creature in Reuben's form has chameleonic properties. The creature then stalks down and kills the others in the lighthouse. Vince dies first, then Adelaide. With its presence now revealed, the alien sheds its disguise: revealing itself to be a Rutan, the hereditary enemies of the Sontarans, a green blob-like amphibious life form, whose scout ship crash landed in the sea and is trying to summon its mother ship. With the Rutans losing the war against the Sontarans, they plan to turn Earth into a base for its strategic position, which will allow them to launch a counterattack. However, once the Sontarans find the planet, it will become subject to a photonic bombardment, taking countless human lives. The Doctor modifies a weapon to destroy the alien. The Doctor and Skinsale retrieve diamonds from Palmerdale's body belt to use the weapon, but Skinsale is killed by the Rutan in the process. The Doctor uses the diamonds as a focus for the electric lighthouse beam to convert it into a high-energy laser by which he destroys the Rutan mother ship. Disobeying the Doctor, Leela watches the laser destroy the ship and is momentarily blinded, and as a side effect the blinding flash turns Leela's eyes from brown to blue. The Doctor quotes Wilfrid Wilson Gibson's poem Flannan Isle as they leave. Production Working titles for this story included The Monster of Fang Rock and The Beast of Fang Rock. Horror of Fang Rock was a late replacement for the scripts Terrance Dicks had originally submitted, a vampire-based tale entitled The Vampire Mutations, which was cancelled close to production as it was feared it could detract from the BBC's Count Dracula a high-profile adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula, which was due for transmission close to when the serial would have aired. A re-written version did, however, eventually see production in 1980 as State of Decay, part of the eighteenth season of Doctor Who. The serial is the only one of the original series to have been produced at BBC studios outside London. Engineering work at those studios meant that it was made at the Pebble Mill Studios of BBC Birmingham instead. According to the DVD commentary supplied by Louise Jameson, John Abbott and Terrance Dicks, a scene in part three was crucial to the behind-the-scenes relationship between Jameson and co-star Tom Baker. In one scene, he consistently came in ahead of his cue, thereby upstaging her. On the grounds that this move was \\"not what they had rehearsed\\" she insisted on three successive retakes until he came in at the rehearsed time. This eventually won his respect. From that point forward, she claims their working relationship was much smoother. Louise Jameson stops wearing her brown contacts at the end of this serial, with the sudden change in colour being explained as a pigment dispersal caused by looking directly into a bright explosion. As mentioned in more than one DVD commentary Jameson had found the contacts painful to wear, and made their removal a condition for her agreeing to play Leela for another season. =Cast notes= Alan Rowe had previously played Dr. Evans and provided the voice from Space Control in The Moonbase (1967) as well as Edward of Wessex in The Time Warrior (1973‚Äì74) and later appeared as Garif in the serial Full Circle (1980). Ralph Watson had previously played Captain Knight in The Web of Fear (1968) as well as Ettis in The Monster of Peladon (1974). Colin Douglas had previously played Donald Bruce in The Enemy of the World (1967‚Äì68). Broadcast and reception Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping, wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \\"A masterpiece, designed to do nothing more than scare kids, which it does very efficiently. It's a very good Leela story, too.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were also positive, describing it as \\"a tightly constructed drama that succeeds because of, rather than in spite of, its confined setting and limited cast\\". They praised the sets, atmosphere, and most of the acting. In 2010, Mark Braxton of Radio Times called the serial \\"classy, cosy, autumnal Who\\", with many pluses, including the good characterisation of Leela, the shock of the Doctor admitting he had done something wrong, and the characterisation of the lighthouse crew. The AV club's Christopher Bahn was critical of the pacing of the end of the story and the \\"often unconvincing\\" special effects but considered the serial to be despite some flaws \\"a classic base-under-siege chiller\\". =Max Headroom intrusion= On 22 November 1987, a broadcast of Horror of Fang Rock by Chicago television station WTTW was interrupted for around 90 seconds by a pirate broadcast featuring an individual disguised as television character Max Headroom. The incident made national headlines and the people responsible were never identified. Commercial Releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in March 1978. According to the DVD commentary, this novelisation features his favourite cover. =Home media= Horror of Fang Rock was released on VHS in July 1998. It was released on Region 2 DVD in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2005, in Australia on Region 4 DVD on 7 April 2005, and in the United States on Region 1 DVD on 6 September 2005.

The most successful Soviet submarine commander in terms of gross register tonnage (GRT) sunk, with 42,000 GRT to his name, he was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1990. Early life Born in Odessa, Marinesko was the son of a Romanian sailor, Ion Marinescu, and a Tatiana Mihailovna Koval from Kherson Province. His father had fled to Imperial Russia after beating an officer and settled in Odessa, Russifying his name to Ivan and changing the last letter \\"u\\" of his surname to \\"o\\". Marinesko trained in the Soviet Merchant Navy and the Black Sea Fleet, and was later moved to a command position in the Baltic Fleet. He was promoted to lieutenant (ensign) in March 1936 and advanced to senior lieutenant (sub-lieutenant) in November 1938. In the summer of 1939 he was appointed commander of the new submarine M-96. When it entered service in mid-1940, it was declared to be the best submarine of the Baltic Fleet. Marinesko was awarded a golden watch and promoted to captain-lieutenant (–∫–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω-–ª–µ–π—Ç–µ–Ω–∞–Ω—Ç, equivalent to lieutenant (O2) in the USN) in 1940.  World War II  USSR together with its then-ally Nazi Germany attacked Poland in September 1939. Nazi Germany attacked its former ally - USSR, in June 1941. The Soviet high command of the Baltic Fleet decided that the M-96 should be sent to the Caspian Sea to serve there as a training boat. But this could not be realized because of the German blockade of Leningrad. On 12 February 1942, a German artillery shell hit M-96, causing considerable damage. In the beginning of 1943, Marinesko was appointed commander of the modernized submarine S-13. Of the 13 units of the Type S (Stalinets), Series IX and IXbis, only this boat survived the war. = Wilhelm Gustloff and Steuben = Marinesko left Porkkala Naval Base on 11 January 1945 and took position near Kolberg on January 13. During the next few days his submarine was attacked several times by German torpedo boats. On 30 January 1945, S-13 attacked and sank the Wilhelm Gustloff, which was evacuating civilians and military personnel from East Prussia. There were probably 9,400 casualties. Days later, on 10 February, Marinesko sank a second German ship with two torpedoes, the Steuben, carrying mostly wounded military personnel, and over 800 civilians, with an estimated total number of 4,267 casualties.Koburger, Charles W., Steel Ships, Iron Crosses, and Refugees, Praeger Publishers, NY, 1989, p.7. Koburger also notes that other equally reliable sources put the total embarked at 3,300. Marinesko thus became the most successful Soviet submarine commander in terms of gross register tonnage (GRT) sunk, with 42,000 GRT to his name. Marinesko's tomb in Bogoslovskoye Cemetery Before sinking the Wilhelm Gustloff, Alexander Marinesko was facing a court martial due to his problems with alcohol and was thus deemed \\"not suitable to be a hero\\". He was instead awarded the Order of the Red Banner. He was downgraded in rank to lieutenant and dishonorably discharged from the navy in October 1945. In 1960 he was reinstated as captain third class and granted a full pension. In 1963 Marinesko was given the traditional ceremony due to a captain upon his successful return from a mission. He died three weeks later on 25 November 1963 from cancer, and was buried at the Bogoslovskoe Cemetery in St. Petersburg. Marinesko was posthumously awarded Hero of the Soviet Union by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 after rehabilitation by the newspaper Izvestia. Legacy Alexander Marinesco on a Moldovan stamp In 1990 Ulitsa Stroitelei (Builders' Street) in St. Petersburg was renamed in his honor to Ulitsa Marinesko, located in Kirovskiy District, connecting Avtovskaya and Zaitseva streets. The Museum of Russian Submarine Forces in St. Petersburg was named after him,St. Petersburg Submarine Museum, –ê.I. Marinesk–æ Museum of Submarine Forces website. and monuments dedicated to him were erected in Kaliningrad, Kronstadt, and Odessa. He is one of the more prominent characters in the G√ºnter Grass' novel Crabwalk (2002), which describes in detail the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff.

It is located south- east of Sidcup. History It took its name from Godwin Fot, a local Saxon landowner recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and from the River Cray that passes through the village. It lay on the old Maidstone Road (now bypassed by the A20 road) leading from London to north Kent. Until the 20th century, Foots Cray dominated the nearby, less ancient hill-top hamlet of Sidcup. The combined area was designated as the Urban District of Foots Cray in 1902. Soon, however, the two settlements' fortunes were reversed, as Foots Cray's traditional industries declined after the First World War, and Sidcup grew rapidly as a commuter town after a railway was built linking it to central London. In 1921 this change was reflected in the renaming of Foots Cray Urban District to Sidcup Urban District. In 1965 both areas became part of the London Borough of Bexley. Historic houses in Foots Cray The Seven Stars, a Grade II-listed pub in Foots Cray William Walsingham (died 1534), of Foots Cray, second son of James Walsingham, lord of the Manor of Scadbury in Chislehurst, Kent, was the father of Sir Francis Walsingham (c.1532-1590), Principal Secretary to Queen Elizabeth I, popularly remembered as her \\"spymaster\\". The estate of Foots Cray Place was rebuilt about 1754 for Bourchier Cleeve, on the site of the manor, as a Palladian mansion that was attributed to Isaac Ware; it was illustrated in this form in Vitruvius Britannicus iv (1777, pls. 8-10).Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, 3rd ed. (Yale University Press), s.v. \\"Isaac Ware\\", under \\"Doubtful and attributed works\\". Foots Cray Place was remodelled for Benjamin Harenc (1792) by the minor London architect Henry Hakewill,Henry Hakewill (1771-1830), a pupil of John Yenn, became architect to the trustees of Rugby School; he is buried at North Cray (Colvin 1995 s.v. \\"Henry Hakewill\\"). who further remodelled it in 1823 for Nicholas Vansittart, 1st Baron Bexley, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Further works were carried out for Lord Bexley by another London architect of equally modest reputation, John William Hiort, who also built Bexley's London house in Great George Street, Westminster.John William Hiort (1772-1861) was an architect attached to the Office of Works, where he was much employed in designing occasional structures for ceremonies; he designed some ancillary structures at Claremont House, Surrey, for Princess Charlotte, and patented bricks for designing circular chimney flues that were used at Buckingham Palace. (Colvin 1995, s.v. \\"John William Hiort\\"). After a fire in 1949, it was demolished in 1950.Colvin 1995, s.v. \\"Henry Hakewell\\". Now only the stable block remains, but the grounds, known as Foots Cray Meadows, provide a valuable public green space in this south-eastern suburb of London. This 89-hectare park was formed in the early 19th century from two mid-18th-century landscaped parks. It is listed by English Heritage as a Grade II historic parkAn impression of the surviving landscape can be obtained from the Hidden London website, and is a Local Nature Reserve. The \\"London LOOP\\" walk passes through Foots Cray Meadows on its way from Old Bexley to Sidcup Place and Petts Wood. There is some industry in an area next to the meadows and bordering the river.

Foots Cray stable block and adjacent walled garden were placed on the English Heritage 'at risk' register but have now been rescued following redevelopment to form a luxury home that was for sale in 2008 at ¬£3.5 million. The town gave its name to the suburb and former city of Footscray, now part of the metro area of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Footscray is now part of the City of Maribyrnong. Geography Foots Cray borders North Cray to the north and north east, Ruxley to the east and south east, St Paul's Cray to the south and south west and Sidcup to the west and north west. Church Just to the north of the main crossroads, All Saints Church, Foots Cray, is situated in Rectory Lane on the edge of Foots Cray Meadows near the River Cray. The church was built in the 1330s but is believed to stand on the site of an earlier (possibly Saxon) church evidenced by the late 12th century Norman font. The church includes a mid 14th century effigy, two 14th century windows on the south side of the nave and in the chapel, and a brass plate recording the death of Thomas Myton, Rector of Foots Cray, in 1489. The west door-case and porch date from about 1500. In 1638 the church owned eight acres of land which included an orchard, garden and cowyard, a dwelling house, hovel, barn and stable.'Footscray' by Gertude Nunns(1982)'All Saints Church in the Parish of Foots Cray'(pamphlet published by All Saints 2007) In 1863 extensive alterations took place, including the removal of the old box pews, with the church being substantially rebuilt. The nave was extended westwards with the bell tower at the west end of the church left standing on four oak posts so that the bells are now rung from the centre of the aisle. During the enlargement and remodelling of the chancel, the remains of twenty burials were found, as was a brass plate engraved with the date 1440 which still had a bunch of lavender placed underneath it. The stained glass windows date from the second half of the 19th century as do the three bells, although the bells were recast in 1987. In 1995-97 major roof repairs took place to the nave, chancel, chapel and vestry at a cost of nearly ¬£70,000.The Millenium Book on All Saints Church Footscray Kent(Bexley Archeological Group) The original parish registers dating back to 1559 were stolen in 1948 when vandals broke into the church and threw the church records into the River Cray, but copies of the register from 1559 to 1832 had been made. The original churchyard was extended in 1876 courtesy of a donation of one acre of land by Robert Arnold Vansittart, and again in 1885. The churchyard includes an unusual iron stone grave slab which marked the burial of Martin Manning 'Yeoman' in 1656 (although the inscription is no longer legible). The granite Sir John Pender monument was blown over in the hurricane of October 1987 despite its great weight and later re-erected by the Pender family and Sir John's old company Cable & Wireless plc. In 1996 when contractors were cleaning out the void just above the walls around the nave, they found a Daily Express newspaper dated 29 October 1957 in an envelope signed by the seven workmen who had been installing a gas-fired boiler.The Millenium Book on All Saints Church Footscray Kent (Bexley Archeological Group) Transport =Buses= Foots Cray is served by 5 London Buses routes. *51 to Orpington via St Paul's Cray & St Mary Cray and to Woolwich via Sidcup, Blackfen, Welling & Plumstead Common. *233 to Eltham via Sidcup & New Eltham and to Swanley via Ruxley. *321 to New Cross Gate via Sidcup, New Eltham, Eltham, Eltham Green, Lee Green & Lewisham (24 hours). *492 to Bluewater via Ruxley Corner, North Cray, Bexley, Bexleyheath, Crayford, Dartford, Stone & Greenhithe and to Sidcup. *R11 to Green Street Green via St Paul's Cray, St Mary Cray & Orpington and to Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup via Sidcup High Street. =Rail= The nearest National Rail stations to Foots Cray are Sidcup and St Mary Cray. Industry The Coca-Cola Company has a large manufacturing and bottling plant in Foots Cray which opened in 1961 and employs 361 people. This plant was where Dasani water was produced. Kolster-Brandes was a manufacturer of radio and television sets that moved to Foots Cray in 1928. The company was later acquired by ITT. The Kolster-Brandes company rugby team, which was formed in 1967, is now called Foots Cray RUFC and competes to this day. The team's badge incorporates the STC letters which represent Standard Telephones and Cables, the company which took over the Kolster Brands business. Fujitsu had a call centre and software development offices on the site of the former Kolster-Brandes factory which closed in 2009. Richard Klinger Group, an Austrian company which made engine gaskets, hydraulic pipelines and water level gauges and valves, had a factory built in 1937 fronting Edgington Way in a Modernist architectural style. This Klinger factory, later bought by French company Trouvey Cauvin, closed in the 1990s and was severely damaged by fire in 2013. The main and flank facades were retained when the building was converted for self-storage use during 2018/19 when the exterior clock was restored. Sport A small short lived greyhound racing track was opened during the mid-1930s in the area. The exact location is unknown but according to the 1934 Kelly's Directory was located on the Sidcup Hill side of Foots Cray. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body, the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. In 1977, Foots Cray Lions football club was established, with one team entering the local league. The club's matches are played at Baugh Road in Foots Cray. The club has male and female adult and junior teams. In 2016 Foots Cray Lions were voted Charter Standard Development Club of the Year by the Football Association.

Sayers, Ronald Knox, Freeman Wills Crofts, Arthur Morrison, Hugh Walpole, John Rhode, Jessie Rickard, Baroness Emma Orczy, R. Austin Freeman, G. D. H. Cole, Margaret Cole, E. C. Bentley, Henry Wade, and H. C. Bailey. Anthony Berkeley was instrumental in setting up the club, and the first president was G. K. Chesterton. There was a fanciful initiation ritual with an oath probably written by either Chesterton or Sayers, and the club held regular dinner meetings in London. Guidelines In addition to meeting for dinners and helping each other with technical aspects in their individual writings, the members of the club agreed to adhere to Knox's Commandments in their writing to give the reader a fair chance at guessing the guilty party. These fair-play \\"rules\\" were summarised by one of the members, Ronald Knox, in an introduction to an anthology of detective stories. They were never intended as more than guidelines, and not all the members took them seriously. The first American member (though then living in the UK) was John Dickson Carr, elected in 1936. The club continues to exist, although the fair-play rules have been considerably relaxed. A number of works were published under the club's sponsorship; most of these were written by multiple members of the club, each contributing one or more chapters in turn. In the case of The Floating Admiral, each author also provided a sealed \\"solution\\" to the mystery as he or she had written it, including the previous chapters. This was done to prevent a writer from adding impossible complications with no reasonable solution in mind. The various partial solutions were published as part of the final book.

Sixteen years later, Peterson's books were adapted into The Littles, an animated series by DIC Entertainment. The television show ran on ABC Saturday mornings from September 10, 1983 to November 2, 1985 for three seasons and 29 episodes. In 1985, DiC released an animated feature film spun off the series titled Here Come the Littles. Similar to Mary Norton's earlier novel The Borrowers, The Littles features a family of tiny, intelligent humanoid creatures with mouse-like features (the Littles) who live in a house owned by the Bigg family. The mouse-like features include a long, furry tail, long teeth and mouse-like ears (in the books the Littles have a tail but not the long teeth and mouse-like ears). Their height is . Characters =The Little Family= The Littles are a family of tiny people living in the walls of human houses. The Little family consists of William T. Little and Wilma Little (Frank and Helen in the TV series), their children Tom and Lucy, and Uncle Pete (Grandpa Little in the TV series). In the books, Uncle Nick, Uncle Pete, Granny and Grandpa (Amos), and Baby Betsy live with the family. Relatives who don't live with them include Cousin Dinky, his wife Della, his mother Lily the nurse, Granny's sister Littlebit, and her cousins Tracy and Gracie. Tom and Lucy Little Tom and Lucy Little both insist on doing good deeds for big people, including a blind woman. One time they tried to find a Grandma Little for Grandpa. They can make mischief around the place. Dinky An older cousin of the other Littles, he is a pilot and serves as the mail service and occasional transport for all tiny people in the area. In the books he flies a glider (competently) and is responsible and adventurous; in the TV series he flies a propeller plane (poorly) and he is clumsy and frequently gets into trouble. Usually these troubles remit directly into Grandpa Little, who loses his temper and charges into \\"disciplining\\" the unfortunate Dinky. In the books he marries Della, who learns to fly. While he lives with his mother Lilly the nurse in the books, in the TV series he lives with the family. Ashley Another younger cousin of Tom and Lucy. Portrayed as a tantrum-prone and rebellious spoiled brat, he often sabotages whatever his older cousins accomplish, only to feel bad about it when Tom and Lucy are put in danger as a result. Appears only in the TV series during seasons two and three. =Henry Bigg= Henry Bigg is the boy who lives in a house with The Littles. He never discovers the Littles in the book series, but in the cartoon he is one of the few people who knows of the Littles' existence. The first season of the TV series never revealed how Henry learned about the Littles, as it opened with Henry telling the audience that he has \\"a very special secret\\" and is the only one who knows about the Littles. During the second season, the opening says that Tom and Lucy fell inside Henry's suitcase when he moved; he discovered them when he opened his suitcase afterward. In the final season, Henry traveled to other parts of the world with his parents, using a specially designed carrier (a hollowed-out camera case) to take the Littles with him. The movie Here Come the Littles follows the second season opening in that Tom and Lucy get trapped in Henry's suitcase. However, Henry doesn't discover them until much later, first seeing Grandpa and Dinky while mowing his Uncle Augustus' yard. Augustus takes them away from Henry, believing them to be toys. To rescue Grandpa and Dinky, Tom and Lucy decide to reveal themselves to Henry, befriending him and asking him for help. Henry takes great care to keep other people, including his own parents, from learning about the Littles. In one episode, however (\\"Dinky's Doomsday Pizzas\\"), Henry betrayed the Littles when he learned that if he did, he would be on TV. The incident, and its resulting fallout, turned out to be only a dream, specifically Dinky's dream. =Slick= Slick is Henry's pet turtle who is usually seen hanging with The Littles. In emergencies when Tom and Lucy must contact Henry, they tie messages on Slick's back and send them to him. Slick wears roller skates to move more quickly but often comically slips and slides around. =Glory= Glory becomes Tom's friend in \\"The Littles and their Amazing new Friend\\" after she saves Tom and Uncle nick from a haystack fire.

This massive cluster of galaxies exerts a large gravitational force, causing all matter within 50 Mpc to experience a bulk flow of 600 km/s toward the Norma Cluster Laniakea A 2014 announcement says that the Centaurus Supercluster (Hydra-Centaurus) is just a lobe in a greater supercluster, Laniakea, that is centered on the Great Attractor. That supercluster would include the Virgo Supercluster, therefore including the Milky Way where Earth resides.

It is one of the three main stars of Orion's Belt along with Alnilam and Mintaka. The primary star, Alnitak Aa, is a hot blue supergiant with an absolute magnitude of -6.0 and is the brightest class O star in the night sky with a visual magnitude of +2.0. It has two bluish 4th magnitude companions, one finely resolved and one only detected interferometrically and spectroscopically, producing a combined magnitude for the trio of +1.77. The stars are members of the Orion OB1 association and the association. Observational history Orion's Belt with Alnitak on the left Alnitak has been known since antiquity and, as a component of Orion's belt, has been of widespread cultural significance. It was reported to be a double star by amateur German astronomer George K. Kunowsky in 1819. Much more recently, in 1998, the bright primary was found by a team from the Lowell Observatory to have a close companion; this had been suspected from observations made with the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer in the 1970s. The stellar parallax derived from observations by the Hipparcos satellite imply a distance around 225 parsecs, but this does not take into account distortions caused by the multiple nature of the system and larger distances have been derived by many authors. Stellar system Alnitak Aa compared to the Sun (to scale) Alnitak is a triple star system at the eastern end of Orion's belt, the second magnitude primary having a 4th magnitude companion nearly 3 arc-seconds distant, in an orbit taking over 1,500 years. The part called Alnitak A is itself a close binary, comprising the stars Alnitak Aa and Alnitak Ab. Alnitak Aa is a blue supergiant of spectral type O9.5Iab with an absolute magnitude of -6.0 and an apparent magnitude of 2.0. It is estimated as being up to 33 times as massive as the Sun and a diameter 20 times greater. It is some 21,000 times brighter than the Sun, with a surface brightness (luminance) some 500 times greater. It is the brightest star of class O in the night sky. Alnitak Ab is a blue subgiant of spectral type B1IV with an absolute magnitude of -3.9 and an apparent magnitude of 4.3, discovered in 1998. A fourth star, 9th magnitude Alnitak C, has not been confirmed to be part of the Aa-Ab-B group, and may simply lie along the line of sight. The Alnitak system is bathed in the nebulosity of IC 434. Etymology and cultural significance Œ∂ Orionis (Latinised as Zeta Orionis) is the star system's Bayer designation and 50 Orionis its Flamsteed designation. The traditional name Alnitak, alternately spelled Al Nitak or Alnitah, is taken from the Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∑ÿßŸÇ an-ni·π≠ƒÅq, \\"the girdle\\".Richard Hinckley Allen, Star-names and their meanings (1936), p. 314-15. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Alnitak for the star Œ∂ Orionis Aa. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. =Orion's Belt= The three belt stars were collectively known by many names in many cultures. Arabic terms include ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ¨ÿßÿØ Al NijƒÅd 'the Belt', ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ≥ŸÉ Al Nasak 'the Line', ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸÇÿßÿ™ Al AlkƒÅt 'the Golden Grains or Nuts' and, in modern Arabic, ŸÖŸäÿ≤ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÇ Al Mƒ´zƒÅn al ·∏§aqq 'the Scale of Justice'. In Chinese mythology they were known as The Weighing Beam. The belt was also the Three Stars mansion (), one of the Twenty-eight mansions of the Chinese constellations. It is one of the western mansions of the White Tiger. In Chinese, (), meaning Three Stars (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka (Orion's Belt), with Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, Saiph, and Rigel later added. ‰∏≠ÂúãÊòüÂ∫ßÁ•ûË©±, written by Èô≥‰πÖÈáë.

The character is created by novelist Robert Ludlum. He first appeared in the novel The Bourne Identity (1980), which was adapted for television in 1988. The novel was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 2002 and starred Matt Damon in the lead role. The character originally featured in three novels by Ludlum, released between 1980 and 1990, followed by eleven novels written by Eric Van Lustbader since 2004. Along with the first feature film, Jason Bourne also appears in three sequel movies The Bourne Supremacy (2004), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), and Jason Bourne (2016), with Damon again in the lead role. Jeremy Renner stars in the fourth film of the franchise, The Bourne Legacy, released in August 2012. Damon stated in interviews that he would not do another Bourne film without Paul Greengrass, who had directed the second and third installments. Greengrass agreed to direct Damon in the fifth installment in the franchise. Greengrass jointly wrote the screenplay with editor Christopher Rouse.  Background  Jason Bourne is but one of many aliases used by David Webb, a career Force Reconnaissance Marine Captain, Foreign Service Officer, and a specialist in Far Eastern affairs. Before the events in The Bourne Identity, Webb had a Thai wife named Dao and two children named Joshua and Alyssa in Phnom Penh. Webb's wife and two children were inadvertently killed during the Vietnam War when a fighter plane strayed into Cambodia, dropped two bombs, and strafed a spot near the Mekong River. However, unknown to Bourne, Joshua survived.Lustbader, Eric Van. The Bourne Legacy. St. Martin's Press, 2004. Due to Cambodia's neutrality in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility for the incident. Infuriated by both the utter injustice and randomness of his loss, Webb went to Saigon and, under the careful guidance of friend and CIA officer Alexander Conklin, ended up training for an elite Top Secret Special Forces unit called \\"Medusa\\". Within that select organization Webb was known only by his code name, \\"Delta One\\". = Medusa = An assassination team or death squad, \\"Medusa\\" was created to infiltrate Northern Vietnam and assassinate members of the Viet Cong and its collaborators. Its members were criminals; its leader, a man called Delta, ran \\"Medusa\\" with an iron fist. He became well known for his ruthlessness, his disregard for orders, and his disturbing success rate on his missions, resulting in the kidnapping of Webb's brother, U.S. Army Lieutenant Gordon Webb, during his tour of duty in Saigon. During the mission to save David Webb's brother, an original \\"Medusa\\" team member named \\"Jason Charles Bourne\\" was discovered to be a double agent who alerted a large number of North Vietnamese soldiers to their whereabouts. When Delta found Bourne after killing his way through the North Vietnamese, he simply killed Bourne in the jungles of Tam Quan. Bourne's murder was never exposed due to the Top Secret status of \\"Medusa\\". = Operation Treadstone = Years later, a black ops arm of the CIA was formed to eliminate the notorious Carlos the Jackal and called \\"Treadstone Seventy-One\\", named after a building on New York's Seventy-First Street, and Webb was called up by the creator of Treadstone and Medusa, David Abbott, who was nicknamed \\"The Monk\\" (short for \\"The Silent Monk of Covert Operations\\") to be its principal agent. At this point, Webb (Delta) takes the identity of Jason Bourne due to the actual Bourne's status as MIA in the war as well as the fact that Bourne was in reality a ruthless killer with a long criminal record. The point of all this was to turn Jason Bourne into something more than he really was, a contract assassin who would be known all over the world for terminating the lives of just about anyone. The assassin's alias was \\"Cain\\". The reasoning for creating such a myth was to create competition for the well-known assassin named \\"Carlos\\", or \\"Carlos the Jackal\\" (real name Ilich Ram√≠rez S√°nchez) who at that time was considered the world's best and most famous assassin. The name Cain was chosen because it had some significance for what he was doing. During Vietnam, Cain was used instead of Charlie in the phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot...) because Charlie became synonymous with Viet Cong. So Delta dropped back one letter to Cain, which stood for Charlie. In Spanish, Charlie is Carlos; Carlos was Venezuelan. The myth of Cain was created by having Cain take credit for any well-publicized killings that took place in Asia, and later in Europe, regardless of the circumstances. By creating this myth, Cain was to drive the reclusive Carlos out in the open \\"long enough to put a bullet in his head\\". To add insult to Carlos's name, Cain stole the credit for Carlos's kills, even when Cain had no part in them.  Film backstory  In the film series, Jason Bourne is revealed to have been born as David Webb on September 13, 1970 (or June 4, 1978 in Jason Bourne) in Nixa, Missouri (although in Ultimatum, he is given a false date of April 15, 1971, as a coded reference to a specific site). In flashbacks, he joins the United States Army and is eventually selected for Delta Force in 1998. His father, Richard Webb, a senior CIA analyst, is responsible for creating the Treadstone program, a black ops project intended to train and deploy elite assassins. The CIA murders his father with a car bomb in Beirut in a bid to recruit Webb. The ploy is shown to have worked; Webb approaches the CIA and is brought into the program by Neil Daniels, a supervisor in the Treadstone program, while being monitored by Dr. Albert Hirsch, who supervises the medical assessment of the Treadstone agents. He is brought into a secret recruitment center in New York City, where Hirsch orders him tortured for days ‚Äî via waterboarding and sleep deprivation ‚Äî to break his spirit and allow him to be molded into an assassin. He is officially accepted when he murders an unidentified man (implied to be the real Jason Bourne) without questioning. After that, he is given a new identity as Jason Bourne, and his birth identity is dropped. After heavy training, in which he learns several languages and masters several martial arts skills, Bourne is placed in the Treadstone program, whose missions are run by the CIA's Alexander Conklin. His first assignment, an unofficial one, is revealed to have happened in Berlin, Germany. It is an assassination of Vladimir Neski, a Russian politician who was intending to expose the theft of $20 million in black funds stolen from the CIA by Treadstone's Director, Ward Abbott, and a Russian oligarch, Yuri Gretkov. Under Conklin's orders, Bourne murders Neski and his wife and arranges it as a murder-suicide. Bourne works in the program as its top agent for three years, stationed in Paris, France, maintaining a secluded life while performing assassinations, mostly around Europe. His official handler is logistics agent Nicky Parsons, also stationed in Paris, who is implied to have feelings for Bourne that she keeps hidden from Treadstone employers. The turning point in his life comes after an order to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord who was blackmailing the CIA into reinstating him as head of his state, lest he expose several CIA secrets. Using an alias, John Michael Kane, Bourne gathers information on Wombosi. He infiltrates the warlord's yacht and hides inside it for five days, surfacing on a cold night in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, intending to arrange the murder to look like he was killed by a crew member to avoid suspicion. However, Wombosi is surrounded by his children, and Bourne is unable to bring himself to kill him. He tries to abandon the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown shooter shoots him twice in the back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing Webb / Bourne to forget his identity.  Appearances  = Novels = The series has included fifteen novels which have been written by two authors, Robert Ludlum and Eric Van Lustbader. Ludlum's series include the first three books, dubbed the Bourne trilogy. After Ludlum's death in 2001, Lustbader took over the character in his own series of novels, which span eleven books as of 2020. A twelfth novel,The Bourne Nemesis, was scheduled to be released in 2019, but as of July 2020 is no longer expected to be published.  Written by Robert Ludlum  = The Bourne Identity (1980) = A man is found floating unconscious in the Mediterranean Sea near Marseille by Italian fishermen with two gunshot wounds in his back. He wakes and discovers he is suffering from extreme memory loss. Film negative embedded in his hip leads him to a bank in Zurich where he learns he is known by the name Jason Bourne. As he tries to reclaim his memory, Bourne attracts the attention of hostile people for reasons unknown to him. At a hotel, while cornered, Bourne takes a young woman, Marie St. Jacques, hostage to escape. Marie is an employee of the Government of Canada. Bourne and Marie discover that \\"Jason Bourne\\" is the cover identity of a contract assassin, and that both the CIA and another contract killer known as Carlos the Jackal have an interest in him. Marie is convinced that this man she has come to know cannot be the ruthless killer that all their discoveries seem to imply. She compels Bourne to continue searching for his true identity and, in the end, he finds the truth. Through this time, Bourne has the phrase \\"Cain is for Charlie, and Delta is for Cain\\" continually flash through his mind, propelling him in the direction of his mission. = The Bourne Supremacy (1986) = Having recovered his memory and retired from the CIA, David Webb now teaches Asian studies at a university in Maine and lives with Marie. She is taken captive seemingly by a powerful Chinese drug lord, but in reality, by the United States government using the fictitious drug lord as cover. The scheme is an attempt to turn Webb back into his former self, the mythical Jason Bourne, to go after a Bourne impostor in China. The phony Bourne has been credited with a Far East political assassination that could, in a worst-case scenario, cause a Chinese civil war over the ownership of Hong Kong. = The Bourne Ultimatum (1990) = As Carlos the Jackal enters old age and his infamy fades, he decides that he will do two things before he dies: kill Jason Bourne and destroy the KGB facility of Novgorod, where the Jackal was trained and later turned away. Webb's family is forced to hide in the Caribbean while Webb himself works with old friend and CIA officer Alex Conklin to hunt down and kill the Jackal first. Webb poses as an important member of Medusa, now a nearly omnipotent economic force that controls the commander of NATO, leading figures in the Defense Department, and large NYSE firms. The plan is to use Medusa's resources to contact the Jackal. Webb just misses the Jackal several times before Webb feigns his own death and convinces the Jackal that he has succeeded. Following this, the Jackal turns to his second goal. Webb tracks the Jackal down with the help of Conklin and a KGB agent as the Jackal begins destroying the KGB compound. In a final confrontation, the Jackal is led into a dam lock in which he drowns and Webb returns to his family.  Written by Eric Van Lustbader  = The Bourne Legacy (2004) = With the climactic events of The Bourne Ultimatum behind him, Jason Bourne is able to once again become David Webb, now professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. However, this serenity does not last for long. When a silenced gunshot narrowly misses Webb's head, the Bourne persona reawakens in him. His first objective is to reach his long-time friend and handler at the CIA, Alex Conklin. However, unknown to Bourne, a Hungarian by the name of Stepan Spalko has now drawn Jason into a web‚Äîone which he cannot escape as easily as his professional fa√ßade. And the man who nearly killed him in Georgetown continues his deadly, intensely personal pursuit. = The Bourne Betrayal (2007) = Jason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the CIA, Martin Lindros, who disappeared in Africa while tracking shipments of uranium. Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of terrorists buying the nuclear material in Odessa. But once there, Bourne is hampered by confusing flashbacks of unfamiliar places and events and he wonders if someone is brainwashing him in order to throw him off the trail, or worse, if the man he saved in Africa is really Martin Lindros. Now, Bourne must gather evidence while trying to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who won't let anyone stand in their way. = The Bourne Sanction (2008) = Jason Bourne returns to Georgetown University, and the mild world of his alter ego, David Webb, hoping for normality. But, after so many adrenaline-soaked years of risking his life, Bourne finds himself chafing under the quiet life of a linguistics professor. Aware of his frustrations, his academic mentor, Professor Spector, asks for help investigating the murder of a former student. The young man died carrying information about a group's terrorist activities, including an immediate plan to attack the United States. The organization, the Black Legion, and its plot have also popped up on the radar of the Central Intelligence Agency, whose new director Veronica Hart is struggling to assert her authority. Sensing an opportunity to take control of the CIA by showing Hart's incompetence, National Security Agency operatives attempt to accomplish what the CIA never could do, hunt down and kill Jason Bourne. In Europe, Bourne's investigation into the Black Legion turns into one of the deadliest and most tangled operations of his double life‚Äîwhile an assassin is getting closer by the minute. = The Bourne Deception (2009) = Bourne's nemesis, Arkadin, is still hot on his trail, and the two continue their struggle, reversing roles of hunter and hunted. When Bourne is ambushed and badly wounded, he fakes his death and goes into hiding. In safety, he takes on a new identity, and begins a mission to find out who tried to assassinate him. Jason begins to question who he really is, how much of him is tied up in the Bourne identity, and what he would become if that was suddenly taken away from him. Meanwhile, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt by what seems to be an Iranian missile. A massive global investigative team is assembled to get at the truth of the situation before it can escalate into an international scandal. Bourne's search for the man who shot him intersects with the search for the people who brought down the airliner, leading Bourne into one of the most deadly and challenging situations he has ever encountered. With the threat of a new world war brewing, Bourne finds himself in a race against time to uncover the truth and find the person behind his assault, all the while being stalked by his unknown nemesis. = The Bourne Objective (2010) = The Bourne Objective is the eighth novel in the Bourne series, and the fifth written by Eric Van Lustbader. The book was released in 2010, sequel to The Bourne Deception. The killing of an art dealer dredges up snatches of Jason Bourne's impaired memory, in particular the murder of a young woman who entrusted him with a strangely engraved ring. Now he's determined to find its owner and purpose. But Bourne never knows what terrible acts he'll discover he committed when he digs into the past. The trail will lead him to a vicious Russian mercenary, Leonid Arkadin, also a graduate of the Central Intelligence training program Treadstone. The covert course was shuttered by Congress for corruption, but not before it produced Bourne and Arkadin, giving them equal skills, equal force, and equal cunning. As Bourne's destiny circles closer to Arkadin's, it becomes clear that someone else has been watching and manipulating them. = The Bourne Dominion (2011) = Jason Bourne is searching for an elusive cadre of terrorists planning to destroy America's most strategic natural resources‚Äîand needs the help of his longtime friend, General Boris Karpov. Karpov, the newly appointed head of Russia's most feared spy agency, FSB-2, is one of the most determined, honorable, and justice-hungry men that Bourne knows. But Karpov has made a deal with the devil. In order to remain the head of FSB-2, he must hunt down and kill Bourne. Now, these two trusted friends are on a deadly collision course. From the Colombian highlands to Munich, C√°diz, and Damascus, the clock is counting down to a disaster that will cripple America's economic and military future. Only Bourne and Karpov have a chance to avert the catastrophe‚Äîbut if they destroy each other first, that chance will be gone forever. = The Bourne Imperative (2012) = The tenth book in the series was published on June 5, 2012. The man Jason Bourne fished out of the freezing sea is near death, half-drowned and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He awakens with no memory of who he is or why he was shot, and Bourne is eerily reminded of his own amnesia. Then Bourne discovers that the Mossad agent named Rebeka is so determined to find this injured man that she has gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency, and is now being stalked by Mossad's most feared killer. The answers to these mysteries may lie back in southeast Lebanon, in a secret encampment to which Bourne and Rebeka escaped following a firefight weeks ago. The complex trail links to the mission given to Treadstone directors Peter Marks and Soraya Moore: find the semi-mythic terrorist assassin known as Nicodemo. In the course of Bourne's desperate, deadly search for a secret that will alter the future of the entire world, he will experience both triumph and loss, and his life will never be the same. Now everything turns on the amnesiac. Bourne must learn his identity and purpose before both he and Rebeka are killed. From Stockholm to Washington, D.C., from Mexico City to Beijing, the web of lies and betrayals extends into a worldwide conspiracy of monumental proportions. = The Bourne Retribution (2013) = The eleventh book in the series was published on December 3, 2013. Bourne's friend Eli Yadin, head of Mossad, learns that Ouyang Jidan, a senior member of China's Politburo, and a major Mexican drug lord may have been trafficking in more than drugs. Yadin needs Bourne to investigate. Bourne agrees, but only because he has a personal agenda: Ouyang Jidan is the man who ordered Rebeka‚Äîone of the very few people Bourne has ever truly cared about‚Äîmurdered. Bourne is determined to avenge her death, but in the process he becomes enmeshed in a monstrous worldwide scheme involving the Chinese, Mexicans, and Russians. Bourne's desperate search for Ouyang takes him from Tel Aviv to Shanghai, Mexico City, and, ultimately, a village on China's coast where a clever trap has been laid for him. Bourne finds himself pursued on all sides and unsure whom he can trust. = The Bourne Ascendancy (2014) = The twelfth book in the Bourne series was published on June 10, 2014. Bourne has been hired to impersonate a high-level government minister at a political summit meeting in Qatar, shielding the minister from any assassination attempts. Suddenly, armed gunmen storm the room, killing everyone but Bourne. Their target, however, isn't the minister Bourne impersonates....it is Bourne himself. Kidnapped and transported to an underground bunker, Bourne finds himself face-to-face with an infamous terrorist named El Ghadan (\\"Tomorrow\\"). El Ghadan holds as his captive Soraya Moore, former co-director of Treadstone, and a close friend to Bourne, along with her two-year-old daughter. Meanwhile, the President of the United States is in the midst of brokering a historic peace treaty between the Israelis and the Palestinians‚Äîan event that El Ghadan is desperate to prevent. He demands that Bourne carry out a special mission: kill the President. If Bourne refuses, Soraya and her daughter will die. Bourne must make a monstrous choice: save Soraya and her daughter, or save the President. = The Bourne Enigma (2016) = The Bourne Enigma is the thirteenth novel in the Bourne series, published on June 21, 2016. On the eve of Russian general Boris Karpov's wedding, Jason Bourne receives an enigmatic message from his old friend and fellow spymaster. In Moscow, what should be a joyous occasion turns bloody and lethal. Now Bourne is the only one who can decipher Karpov's cryptogram. He discovers that Karpov has betrayed his sovereign to warn Bourne of a crippling disaster about to be visited on the world. Bourne has only four days to discover the nature of the disaster and stop it. The trail Karpov has been following leads Bourne to Cairo and the doorstep of Ivan Borz, the elusive international arms dealer infamous for hiding behind a never-ending series of false identities, a man Bourne has been hunting ever since he abducted former Treadstone director Soraya Moore and her two-year-old daughter and brutally murdered Soraya's husband. Bourne must travel to war-torn Syria and then Cyprus as he chases the astonishing truth. The clock is ticking, and Bourne has less than four days to solve Karpov's riddle‚Äîand hunt down Borz‚Äîif he hopes to prevent a cataclysmic international war . . . = The Bourne Initiative (2017) = The Bourne Initiative is the fourteenth novel in the Bourne series, and was published in July 2017. Gen. Boris Karpov, head of the feared Russian FSB, is dead. But Karpov has reached out from the grave with an unstoppable cyber operation he conceived in the months before his murder, aimed at the heart of the United States‚Äîa way to steal the president's nuclear launch codes. Who has taken over the operation? Karpov trusted only one man: Jason Bourne. But can Bourne be working against his own country? Gen. Arthur MacQuerrie, chief of the Dreadnaught Section of NSA and Morgana Broussard, head of the mysterious Meme, LLC, are convinced of Bourne's treasonous act, and will do everything in their power to kill him. Flushed from cover, hunted by the best assassins in the business, wounded and nearly killed, Bourne's only hope is to join forces with his bitterest enemy, a Somali magus named Keyre, whose terrorist forces Bourne once decimated. Now Keyre is more powerful than ever, with a burgeoning international network‚Äîa man who can help Bourne, but to what end? Lying in wait is the young woman Bourne saved from Keyre's torture, who now calls herself the Angelmaker. Both seductive and deadly, the Angelmaker loves Bourne, watches over him, but from whom does she take her orders? Is she ally or adversary? These are questions Bourne must answer before he can unravel the mystery of Boris Karpov's last legacy, a weaponized code that may very well bring about the unthinkable: a violent end to America. = The Bourne Nemesis (2019) = The Bourne Nemesis is the fifteenth novel in the Bourne series, and had been scheduled to be published in 2019, but missed its publication date and no future publication date was given. Jason Bourne returns. He's fought against the NSA, Black off-site cyber operations, a Somali terrorist organisation and been accused of treason against the US. Now the Russians have planted a mole to uncover Bourne's secrets and launch cyber-warfare against the United States. Meanwhile, Bourne's former colleague, Soroya Moore, needs his help. Six highly skilled field agents have disappeared, the body parts of three found in a national park in Georgia. Facing death and destruction in the shadows of civilisation, Bourne will battle his deadliest nemesis yet.  Written by Brian Freeman  = The Bourne Evolution (2020) = Jason Bourne has gone rogue, leaving Treadstone behind and going on a new mission to infiltrate and expose an extremist group, called Medusa. And while more enemies begin to hunt down Bourne while he investigates, it's a race against time to discover who led him into this trap and what their next move is going to be. = Television = In 1988, a two-part made-for-television movie of The Bourne Identity aired on ABC. It starred Richard Chamberlain as Jason Bourne and Jaclyn Smith as Marie St. Jacques. The TV movie was largely faithful to Robert Ludlum's novel, both in plot as well as in the portrayal of the character of Jason Bourne. A spin-off of the Universal-produced film franchise entitled Treadstone began airing in October 2019 on USA Network. It explores the origins of the Treadstone program and operatives other than Bourne. Producer Ben Smith, who worked on the recent two Bourne films, said the show will tie into the next film in the franchise.https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481543/another-bourne-movie-is-in- the-works-and-itll-tie-into-the-treadstone-tv-show = Film = Actor Matt Damon, who portrays Jason Bourne in the film series The Jason Bourne novels were adapted into a series of films ‚Äì The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Jason Bourne (2016). The films retain the titles and some base elements but otherwise feature different plots independent of the novels. In these films, Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon. Bourne does not appear in The Bourne Legacy, with the exception of his picture being featured in the film as well as brief discussions of how he's caused problems to the organization he worked for. As a result, the film focuses on the fallout in the intelligence community from Bourne's actions in Ultimatum. Legacy features Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, an operative in a different clandestine program evolved from Treadstone. = Video games = A video game titled Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy was released in 2008 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Ludlum estate obtained the rights to the video game franchise and sold it to Electronic Arts in 2009. EA planned to make several Bourne games.

Description The township consisted of 54 mi¬≤ (140 km¬≤), which included two small islands in the Detroit River. It was bordered to the north by Springwells Township with the boundary being the River Rouge. To the west it was bordered by Dearborn and Taylor Townships, with the primary boundary being Pelham Road. To the south it was bordered by Monguagon Township, and a small part of Brownstown Township, with the primary boundary being Pennsylvania Road. Finally, to the east, it was bordered by the Detroit River. Organized in 1827, the entire township has since been incorporated, and includes the cities of Melvindale, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, River Rouge, Ecorse, Southgate, Wyandotte, and the Boynton and Oakwood Heights neighborhoods of Detroit. History Although French explorers, missionaries, and traders frequented the area, the first existing record of a white settler owning land dates to 1776, when the Pottawatomi ceded a large tract of land to Pierre St. Cosme. One boundary of the ceded land came to be known as \\"St. Cosme Line\\" and later became part of the route of Southfield Road. In the late 18th century, many land grants in the area were awarded by the French crown. The first known permanent settler in what would become Ecorse Township was Pierre Michel Campau, who arrived in 1795. He settle in Southgate, which subsequently became a farming community. Other people from the Detroit area at the Rouge and Detroit Rivers followed him to Southgate. Some records indicate settlers near the mouth of the Ecorse River as early as 1764. The township was established on April 12, 1827 along with eight other townships by the Michigan Territorial Legislature in a major reorganization of Wayne County.

In 1700 he was sent as Rouen's Advocate-Deputy to the Council of Commerce held in Paris convened to promote trade agreements for France. At Versailles he made his mark, thereafter being nominated to go on three missions to Spain, between the years 1704 and 1705, to negotiate financial arrangements. In Spain he was appointed Harbor Master of Cadiz and he helped improve trade with the Spanish colonies. In August 1711 he was sent on a secret mission to London to detach Great Britain from its alliance against France, and succeeded in securing the adoption of eight articles which formed the base of the later Treaty of Utrecht. His negotiating and diplomacy skills were rewarded by his being one of the three French Plenipotentiaries deputed to Utrecht in January 1712, having the honour of signing the Treaty in the following year. His appointment as Ambassadeur was a form of recompense by King Louis XIV for M√©nager's spending a fortune in diplomatic efforts; he was also awarded a Crown pension and created a Count (for life).

They are distinguished from the Open Brethren from whom they separated in 1848. The Exclusive Brethren are now divided into a number of groups, most of which differ on minor points of doctrine or practice. Perhaps the best-known of these, mainly through media attention,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1fAeRXn6aM The Exclusive Brethren- Cult Documentary is the Raven-Taylor-Hales group, now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, which maintains the doctrine of uncompromising separation from the world based on their interpretation of 2 Corinthians 6 and 2 Timothy 2, believing that attendance at the Communion Service, the 'Lord's Supper', governs and strictly limits their relationship with others, even other Brethren groups. These brethren have one fellowship in some nineteen countries ‚Äî including France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Argentina, Jamaica, Barbados, St Vincent and the Grenadines, but they are more numerous in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and North America where they are referred to just as the Exclusive Brethren or Brethren. History The Plymouth Brethren split into Exclusive and Open Brethren in 1848 when George M√ºller refused to accept John Nelson Darby's view of the relationship between local assemblies following difficulties in the Plymouth meeting. Brethren that held Muller's congregational view became known as \\"Open\\", those holding Darby's 'connexional' view, became known as \\"Exclusive\\" or \\"Darbyite\\" Brethren. Darby's circular on 26 August 1848, cutting off not only Bethesda but all assemblies who received anyone who had ever attended Bethesda, was to define the essential characteristic of \\"exclusivism\\" that he was to pursue for the rest of his life. He set it out in detail in a pamphlet he issued in 1853 entitled Separation from Evil - God‚Äôs Principle of Unity. But a tension had existed since the earliest times, as set out in a letter from Anthony Norris Groves in 1836 to Darby (who was not a believer in adult baptism): > Some will not have me hold communion with the Scotts, because their views > are not satisfactory about the Lord‚Äôs Supper; others with you, because of > your views about baptism; others with the Church of England, because of her > thoughts about ministry. On my principles, I receive them all; but on the > principle of witnessing against evil, I should reject them all. For most of his life, Darby was able to hold the exclusives together, although several longtime members had seceded after accusing him of similar errors about the nature of Christ's humanity of which he had accused Benjamin Wills Newton. The Central Meeting in London (London Bridge) would communicate with the other assemblies and most difficulties were eventually smoothed over. But shortly before he died in 1882, things started to fall apart. It all started from an initiative in 1879 of Edward Cronin, one of the Dublin founding members, that paralleled Darby's initiation of a new assembly at Plymouth thirty years before. Some members had left a failing assembly in Ryde and Cronin travelled down to break bread with them. When he reported back to London, different assemblies took differing views of his action. Though Darby was sympathetic in private he attacked him fiercely in public. By 1881 an assembly in Ramsgate had itself split over the issue and the division, over an issue not of doctrine or principle but church governance, became irrevocable. The excluded party became known as the \\"Kelly Brethren\\", although William Kelly remained devoted to the memory of Darby and edited his collected papers. But after another division in 1885, three years after Darby's death, when a London assembly excommunicated a brother in Reading over the \\"standing\\" of a Christian, the minority in the resultant split (Stuarts) adopted a more \\"open\\" approach to fellowship, as did those who followed Grant in America. A more serious split occurred in 1890 around the teaching of F. E. Raven of Greenwich. \\"The seceders from his communion falsely accused him of denying the orthodox doctrine of the union of the Divine and the human natures in the Man Christ Jesus ‚Äì not indeed in a Unitarian, but in a Gnostic sense.\\" After furious strife in which the leading opponent was William Lowe, many of the remaining assemblies in Britain stayed with Raven but those on the continent separated whilst the American assemblies were split. = 20th century = Not all of the people remaining in fellowship with Raven agreed with him and this led in 1908-9 to further splits, initiated by actions of the Glanton assembly in Northumberland over dissensions in the neighbouring Alnwick assembly. Once more assemblies had to decide which side to support and this included those as far away as Melbourne, Australia. Thus the Ravens and the Glantons were established. In the same year a festering disagreement in Tunbridge Wells led to a minor breakaway from the Lowe group by a number of assemblies. A further division took place in 1970. By this time, James Taylor, Jr. had come to control what had been the Raven group. At a meeting in Aberdeen, Scotland, on 25 July, it was alleged Taylor‚Äôs behaviour was improper. His host published a long letter of protest which was sent to the New York assembly. Taylor immediately rejected these accusations as lies and the incident definitively divided the Brethren membership worldwide. Very few based near the scene of the events stayed in fellowship with Taylor ‚Äî only two families in Aberdeen and 200 out of 3,000 members in Scotland remained. Altogether, over 200 such assemblies in England, Scotland and Ireland seceded from the Taylor group, according to a 1971 listing. Others, especially those further afield, believed Taylor's line that he was a pure man and that this incident was used by God to expose his enemies. Following this incident, those who separated from Taylor \\"rolled back\\" the changes in doctrine and practice that he had introduced, reverting to the teachings that had been followed in the time of his father, James Taylor, Sr., who had led the movement from 1905 till his death in 1953. This fellowship further fragmented in 1972, and the party which broke away has since further sub-divided. However the history of Exclusive Brethren is not only one of division. Eventually several of the groups realised that the divisions caused by personalities clashes or ecclesiastical issues were no longer relevant and reunions occurred. The Kelly and Lowe groups reunited in 1926 to form the Lowe-Kelly group, in 1940 with most of Tunbridge Wells and in 1974 with the Glantons and are sometimes known as Reunited Brethren. There was a further split in 2000, catalysed by tensions concerning Willem Ouweneel, one of the 'Dutch Five' in 1995.https://www.bruederbewegung.de/personen/interviews/ouweneel1.html#Einstieg Their ageing congregations have often not been replenished, and are dwindling. Most of the Grant party merged with the Open Brethren in 1932. Most Exclusive Brethren have traditionally been described as \\"Darbyite\\" as they adhere in the main to the original doctrines and teachings of John Darby, and do not accept the concept of a doctrine that evolves through the teachings of successive leaders. Neither do they accept the concept that teachings of church leaders are authoritative, divinely sanctioned, and binding on those in fellowship, as is the belief of the Raven/Taylor/Hales Brethren. General overview At one time, all Exclusive Brethren groups believed that there was a necessary unity of the local church or assembly, but some who once were in fellowship with the Raven/Taylor/Hales group have become independent companies modifying their requirements for receiving members to suit individual conscience. Amongst such groups views concerning their way of life and relationships are frequently affected by the varying standards in the general community. This is expressed practically in different ways by the different groups, but matters of fellowship and church discipline used to be generally not merely questions of local responsibility; such decisions would have been accepted in all meetings. Exclusive Brethren were therefore sometimes described as Connexional Brethren, as they recognised an obligation to accept and adhere to the disciplinary actions of other associated assemblies. For example, where one of their branches had excluded a person from Christian fellowship, that person remained excluded from all other branches, who must then treat the excluded person as a leper (according to the book of Leviticus Chapter 15). This is still the practice amongst the Brethren and no doubt would be claimed by other independent assemblies. There are common threads throughout all Plymouth Brethren groups, most notably the centrality of the Lord‚Äôs Supper (Holy Communion) in the weekly calendar as well as the format of meetings and worship: the distinctions between the many groups are generally not well understood by non-members. The adjective exclusive has been applied to the groups by others, partially due to their determination to separate from and exclude what they believe to be evil. Exclusive Brethren usually disown any name and simply refer to themselves as Christians, brethren, those with whom we walk, those in fellowship with us, or the saints. However, the Raven/Taylor/Hales group being the most universally identifiable has attracted the term Exclusive Brethren and accepted its application to themselves as meaning, the exclusion of, or withdrawal from, evil. Dissecting the history and branches of the Exclusive Brethren, particularly in the 20th century, can be a challenge as there has been no formal mechanism for documenting their movement's history. Beliefs and structure This notice indicates that the meeting room is a registered place of worship and gives contact details. (Five Oak Green Meeting Room, Kent). With the exception of the hardline Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC), Exclusive Brethren differ very little from the Open Brethren on theological issues, both holding the Bible as their sole authority in regard to matters of doctrine and practice. Like the Exclusives, Open Brethren have traditionally based much of their doctrine on the teachings of John Nelson Darby. With few exceptions, particularly in regards to whom to accept into fellowship, exclusive brethren have continued to hold the same beliefs that inspired the early Plymouth Brethren. The centrality of the Lord's Supper (Holy Communion) is one of the primary linking threads between the different Brethren groups; however, it is also one of the primary differentiators between the various Exclusive Brethren sub-groups: there are exclusive groups which receive all professing Christians to communion, and there are exclusive groups which restrict access to communion to those who are known to be in their fellowship. The PBCC are generally regarded as having the most stringent and uncompromising views on this. However, only two of their services are closed to those who are not members in good standing, the Lord's Supper and the monthly Care Meeting, with well disposed members of the public free to come into Gospel Preachings and other meetings. Most Exclusive Brethren groups have no formal leadership structure. In many assemblies, matters up for debate may be discussed at special meetings attended solely by adult males called, in some groups, \\"Brothers Meetings\\". As a result, schisms can occur in the Brethren over disagreements about church discipline and whether other sister groups in other locations have authority to intervene in these disagreements. There are often global family connections due to the emphasis among members to marry within the Exclusive Brethren, and family connections often influences which side of the issue members will take. The PBCC avoid this trend by having a structured leadership with a central authority figure which has maintained unity through the upholding of a universal standard. Some Exclusive Brethren assemblies \\"commend\\" men who are dedicated to the work of preaching. Although they usually do not receive a salary, gifts are often given to them by the separate assemblies where they preach and teach. Exclusive Brethren do not generally name their meeting rooms or Halls except by reference perhaps to the road, e.g. Galpins Road Meeting Room, Mallow Street Hall. The meeting room or Hall is often referred to as \\"The Room\\" or \\"The Hall\\". Notice boards give the times of Gospel Preachings with a formula such as \\"If the Lord will, the Gospel will be preached in this room Lord's Day at 6.30.\\" Meeting rooms of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, perhaps the most hardline of the Exclusive Brethren groups, have notice boards indicating that the building is a place registered for public worship and give a contact number for further information. Unlike the Open Brethren, whose assemblies usually do not have an official membership, Exclusive Brethren are more particular about affiliation, as people who wish to break bread must be affiliated with a \\"home assembly\\" to which they are responsible in terms of lifestyle choices. Worship Hymns are a vital part of the worship of Exclusive Brethren. One of the unifying features in each of the different branches of the Brethren is a common hymnbook. The first collection used among the united assemblies was, \\"Hymns for the Poor of the Flock,\\" from 1838 and again in 1840. Another such hymnbook, used by Exclusive Brethren (Tunbridge-Wells and Ames) dating back to 1856 is called, \\"Hymns and Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock,\\" the first edition of which was compiled by G.V. Wigram. A revision was made in 1881 by J.N. Darby. The Little Flock hymnbook has gone through many different editions in different languages. In modern times one of the more commonly used English hymn books in British and North American assemblies is The Believers Hymn Book. Most branches of Exclusive Brethren use one of the many editions of the Little Flock Hymn Book. All editions come from the same source: J.N.Darby's hymnbook of 1881 which drew on earlier work by George V. Wigram. Some Exclusive meetings seat accepted men (men who are \\"in fellowship\\") in the front rows toward the table bearing the emblems, with accepted women behind the men, and unaccepted men and women toward the rear. Other Exclusive meetings seat accepted men and women together (so spouses can be seated together), and unaccepted men and women towards the rear in the \\"Seat of the Unlearned\\" or \\"Seat of the Observer\\". Women in Exclusive Brethren gatherings quite commonly wear a headscarf or \\"mantilla\\" (a lace/doily-like Spanish veil) on their heads. It is a fairly common misconception that Exclusive women characteristically wear a shawl over their heads, though some women may have resorted to this. They do however always cover their heads when praying. Numbers It is difficult to number the Exclusive Brethren, with the exception of the Raven/Taylor/Hales group, of which there are approximately 46,000 meeting in 300 church assemblies in 19 countries, with strongest representation in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, and North America. Other Exclusive groups now number only 2‚Äì3,000 in the UK but there are larger numbers on the European continent and also in North America. Film portrayal The Exclusive Hales branch of the Plymouth Brethren are portrayed in the film Son of Rambow as trying to restrict the creativity and freedom of the film's main character. The Plymouth Brethren are also featured in the book Oscar and Lucinda by Peter Carey, and in the film adaptation. Oscar is raised by a strict Plymouth Brethren father and rebels by becoming an Anglican priest. Criticism Some have suggested that the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC), the subgroup of the Exclusive Brethren that has attracted the most media coverage, can be categorized as a cult because of its policy of separating itself from other orthodox denominations and because it prohibits radio and television, limits the use of computers and discourages socializing with people outside the movement. Critics of the PBCC have accused it of using cult-like techniques by controlling all aspects of its members' lives. The group's control over its members is such that many who have left the group have had trouble adjusting to life outside. To help with this problem, several websites have been set up to assist people who have left the church to adjust into mainstream society. Involvement of members of the Exclusive Brethren Church in New Zealand in electioneering led to criticism in the context of the 2005 New Zealand election funding controversy. The church distributed political material criticising the New Zealand Labour Party government, and the leader of the opposition party admitted knowledge of the church's activities.

The band's name was inspired by a former drummer who was narcoleptic. The band revolves around the distinctive vocal style of multi- instrumentalist and songwriter Luke Steele. Stemming from a musical family, Luke's father Rick Steele is a local blues musician, and two of Luke's siblings are also musicians, with brother Jesse a former member of The Sleepy Jackson (and currently performing with father Rick in The Hot Biscuit Band), and sister Katy, who fronts another Perth rock band, Little Birdy. While a series of acclaimed EPs brought The Sleepy Jackson to a broader musical attention of Australia, it was the release of their 2003 album Lovers and 2006 second album Personality ‚Äì One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird that directed significant international focus upon the band. History =Miniskirt EP= The Sleepy Jackson formed in 1998 with the original lineup featuring Luke Steele (vocals and guitars), Jesse Steele (drums), and Matthew O'Connor (bass). This lineup recorded a self-titled debut EP and a subsequent single titled \\"Miniskirt.\\" Both recordings were independently released. Dan Bull joined the lineup in 1999 as the band's first live keyboard player (who later played keys with Eskimo Joe at their live performances). In 2000, as a result of non-musical commitments, Luke suggested that his brother should redirect his attentions and concentrate on other happenings in his life which ultimately resulted in Jesse following his advice and departing the band. The void created by Jesse Steele's departure was filled by Paul Keenan (who later drummed with Eskimo Joe at their live performances). Along with numerous shows in their hometown of Perth, in late 2000 The Sleepy Jackson toured nationally with Jebediah. In March 2001, on the eve of the band's signing with EMI Records, the band toured with Magic Dirt and Motor Ace with Ronan Charles on keyboards joining Steele, O'Connor and Keenan. Five weeks into the tour, with the band broke, exhausted, and sleeping in caravan parks rather than enjoying the luxuries their touring partners were enjoying, O'Connor, Keenan and Charles quit, leaving Luke Steele to complete the tour solo. =EMI EPs= Upon signing to EMI, pressure was soon placed on Steele to produce a recording. The result was the 2001 EP titled Caffeine in the Morning Sun, which Steele recorded in Sydney with a collection of session musicians. In addition to playing solo, Steele recruited drummer Malcolm Clark into The Sleepy Jackson fold and, when some serious touring was required in support of the release, the services of Justin Burford (guitar) and Rodney Aravena (bass) were enlisted. In addition to The Sleepy Jackson, Steele's three colleagues were also playing around their hometown with Jonathon Dudman under the name End of Fashion. The Sleepy Jackson relocated to Sydney, where they recorded another EP, Let Your Love Be Love, in late 2002. Songs from this EP and Caffeine in the Morning Sun were compiled together to form a self-titled mini- album for release in the UK market in February 2003. A period of extensive touring quickly followed, which saw the band playing in Australia, the United States, and Europe. The latter brought the band some very enthusiastic attention from UK music magazine NME. =Lovers= In between live appearances, The Sleepy Jackson worked on recordings that were to become their debut album Lovers. During a series of UK appearances in 2003, Burford and Aravena left the band. With a support slot for Silverchair's Diorama tour looming back in Australia, replacements were quickly sought. Clarke called upon the only other End of Fashion member not previously part of The Sleepy Jackson, Jonathon Dudman. Dudman joined the band in Sydney, where he took over bass duties, and the second guitarist position was filled by session musician Ben Nightingale. The Sleepy Jackson's revolving door continued when Nightingale was ultimately replaced by Jonathon Dudman's brother, Julian Dudman. But the Dudmans subsequently left the band, leaving Luke Steele and Malcolm Clark as the only official members of The Sleepy Jackson. =Personality ‚Äì One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird= The Sleepy Jackson released their second full-length album Personality ‚Äì One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird in Australia on 1 July 2006, where it debuted at number 10 on the Australian Albums Chart the following week. Later that July, the album was nominated for a J Award by Australian radio station Triple J. With Personality's predecessor Lovers also receiving generous support from both critics and radio alike, the band supported the new album's worldwide release with a series of live appearances in select markets. Joining Steele and Clark were Dave Symes and Felix Bloxsom, who both worked on the album, and Lee Jones who was formerly in the Perth band Spencer Tracy. Bloxsom has since been replaced by Luke's brother Jake and Luke's wife Jodi, a.k.a. \\"Snappy Dolphin,\\" which also brought a change from organic percussion instruments to computer samples backing the band. =Touring= In 2007, The Sleepy Jackson performed at the 2007 Big Day Out, the Southbound festival, the Falls Festival and the St. Jerome's Laneway festivals in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. Also in 2007, Steele provided slide guitar to the song \\"Waiting All Day\\" by Silverchair on their fifth album Young Modern. Steele also appeared on the Pnau single \\"With You Forever,\\" leading Nick Littlemore to state on Pnau's website \\"...working with Luke Steele... it was amazing, that inspired [me] to work on a separate project with him all together. It's another album we're doing.\\" =Compilation albums= The Sleepy Jackson were one of the artists contributing to Yoko Ono's album Yes, I'm A Witch, which was released in 2007 and is a compilation of remixed versions of Yoko's songs performed by various invited artists. The Sleepy Jackson contributed the remix of the song \\"I'm Moving On\\".Yes, I'm a Witch =2012 onwards= The status of the band following the completion of touring for the second album is uncertain, with the band's official website no longer active. However, as of 2012, the band remains listed on the \\"Artists\\" page of the EMI Music website. In late May 2013, as part of an interview for the second Empire of the Sun album Ice on the Dune, Steele revealed that a third Sleepy Jackson album was heard by the band's record label but a lack of subsequent interest meant that it was never released. As of 22 May 2013, Steele is focused on completing a collaboration with fellow Australian musician Daniel Johns and promotion for Ice on the Dune, with the latter released on 14 June 2013. Steele stated that he intends to release the third album prior to 2023 and that a release date during 2013 was highly unlikely. Meanwhile, Clark completed a tour as the drummer of Australian artist Bob Evans's backing band in mid-May 2013. Side projects In late 2007, Steele formed the electropop duo Empire of the Sun with Littlemore. Empire of the Sun's released its debut album Walking on a Dream, in addition to two single releases, \\"Walking on a Dream\\" and \\"We Are the People\\"‚Äîthe project gained success in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (UK), Ireland and some parts of Europe in 2008. At the 2009 Australian Recording Industry Association Music (ARIA) Awards, Empire of the Sun received four awards: \\"Best Group\\", \\"Album of the Year\\", \\"Single of the Year\\" and \\"Best Pop Release\\". As of May 2013, Steele stated that he is completing a recording project that he commenced with Johns at his Newcastle, Australia studio in 2008. In a 2013 interview, Steele explained: \\"Me and Daniel Johns have been in the studio working on our record, and we‚Äôre just about ready to try and finish that off. The sessions we did lately sound a bit like The Clash, Talking Heads ‚Ä¶ inspired by African music. So it‚Äôs going to be good to do some tougher, hard-edged kind of stuff.‚Äù In 2008 the name of the project was \\"Hathaway and Palmer\\", according to a radio interview that Steele conducted, but this has not been confirmed since. In early 2009, Clark joined The Exploders, a Melbourne-based band, whose members include former Sleepy Jackson bassist Jonathon Dudman (aka J. Cortez). In 2010, Clark and Dudman joined Jeff Martin of The Tea Party in a new band, \\"Jeff Martin 777\\"‚Äîthe band released its debut album The Ground Cries Out in early 2011. Clark has undertaken the role of drummer in the touring band of Australian singer-songwriter Kevin Mitchell's \\"Bob Evans\\" moniker. Clark has joined Mitchell during the tours for the albums Goodnight Bull Creek! and Familiar Stranger.

A long-time member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he served as First Deputy Prime Minister, as a full member of the Politburo and as the Chairman of the KGB from December 1958 to November 1961. He continued to maintain decisive influence in the KGB until 1967; his successor as KGB Chairman, Vladimir Semichastny, was his client and prot√©g√©.Martin McCauley, Who's Who in Russia since 1900, page 184, Routledge, 1997 Intelligent, ambitious and well-educated,Aleksandr Nikolaevich Shelepin, Oxford Dictionary of Political Biography Shelepin was the leader of a hard-line faction within the Communist Party that played a decisive role in overthrowing Nikita Khrushchev in 1964. Opposed to the policy of d√©tente, he was eventually outmaneuvered by Leonid Brezhnev and gradually stripped of his power, thus failing in his ambition to lead the Soviet Union. Early life Alexander Shelepin was born in Voronezh on 18 August 1918 to a middle-class family, the son of Nikolai Shelepin, a railway official. A talented student, he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy and then obtained a master's degree from the Moscow Institute of History. He started his political career in the Communist Youth League (Komsomol) while still a student, and already in his teens he had expressed his desire to become a party leader. World War II and service under Stalin Shelepin briefly served in the Red Army in 1940, during the last stages of the Winter War against Finland, and after the Nazi invasion in 1941, he helped organize the guerrilla partisan movement in the Moscow region; after the notorious execution by the Nazis of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya (whom Shelepin had personally selected), he caught the eye of Joseph Stalin himself, and his political fortune was made. He became a senior official of the Komsomol, working in the All-Union Secretariat in Moscow, and was then named General Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, an international youth organization recognized by the United Nations and granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. In 1952, in one of Stalin's last personnel reshuffles, Shelepin became First Secretary of the All-Union Komsomol. Service under Khrushchev Though closely identified with Stalin (and being somewhat of a favorite of his), Shelepin was not affected by De-Stalinization and the gradual consolidation of power by Nikita Khrushchev after Stalin's death in 1953. Indeed, Khrushchev personally liked Shelepin and, because of his rise through the Communist Youth League, saw him as an ally against the secret police and security agencies that had been all-powerful under Stalin. Shelepin accompanied Khrushchev on the Soviet leader's trip to the People's Republic of China in 1954, and met with Mao Zedong. Following this, he mobilized thousands of young Communists in support of Khrushchev's ‚ÄòVirgin Lands‚Äô program. In early 1958, Khrushchev appointed Shelepin as Central Committee Secretary in charge of the Party Organs Department, and, in December 1958, Shelepin became the Chairman of the Soviet central intelligence and security service, the KGB, replacing Army General Ivan Serov. Khrushchev saw Shelepin as a very good choice for KGB chief, for several reasons; Shelepin's background completely outside state security, his higher education and intellectual approach greatly distinguished him from his predecessors, and his appointment was intended to improve the public image of the KGB. Shelepin attempted to return state security and intelligence to its position of importance during the Stalinist era. However, the people he favored were completely different than those preferred by his predecessors. With Khrushchev's full backing, Shelepin recruited many young university graduates to the KGB (especially favoring those with a background in law and the social sciences) and he demoted or fired many career state security officers, replacing them with officials from Communist Party organizations, and, especially, from the Communist Youth League. As a result of Shelepin's ambitious policy, the KGB became a substantially different organization from the Stalin-era security services, with a more sophisticated and intellectual approach, that would be further encouraged by future Chairman Yuri Andropov. Shelepin proposed and carried out the destruction of many documents related to the Katyn massacre of Polish officers to minimize the chance that the truth would be revealed.Ouimet, Matthew J. (2003). The rise and fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine in Soviet foreign policy. UNC Press Books. p. 126. .Cienciala, Anna M.; Materski, Wojciech (2007). Katyn: a crime without punishment. Yale University Press. pp. 240‚Äì241. . His 3 March 1959 note to Nikita Khrushchev, with information about the execution of 21,857 Poles and with the proposal to destroy their personal files, became one of the documents that were preserved and eventually made public.Sanford, George (2005). Katyn and the Soviet massacre of 1940: truth, justice and memory. Psychology Press. p. 94. .RFE/RL Research Institute (1993).

Retrieved 7 May 2011. \\"One of the documents turned over to the Poles on 14 October was Shelepin's handwritten report from 1959\\" The policy of providing KGB support to left-wing nationalist liberation movements in wars of national liberation in Latin America, Asia and Africa was another important innovation of Shelepin's new approach as KGB Chairman, adopted during the summer of 1961 by Khrushchev and the Central Committee following a detailed proposal by Shelepin. Fidel Castro and Cuba strongly supported an aggressive policy of military assistance to national liberation movements with Che Guevara, in co-operation with Ben Bella of Algeria, also playing a leading role. Coup against Khrushchev Shelepin left the KGB in November 1961 and became a First Deputy Prime Minister; Khrushchev also made him Chairman of the powerful new Committee of Party and State Control, from where he still exercised control over the KGB, which was taken over by his client and prot√©g√© Vladimir Semichastny. He was a principal player in the coup against Khrushchev in October 1964, obviously influencing the KGB to support the conspirators. Shelepin probably expected to become First Secretary and de facto leader of the USSR when Khrushchev was overthrown. Shelepin occupied a powerful position, controlling the KGB and leading a large hard-line faction within the Party, as well as holding two high-level posts, one in the Council of Ministers as Deputy Prime Minister and one in the central party apparatus as a member of the Secretariat. However, he lacked influence in the military, and was viewed very suspiciously by most Central Committee and Government officials outside his faction, who were well- aware of his ambitions. Alexander Solzhenitsyn suggested that Shelepin had been the choice of the surviving Stalinists, who asked \\"what had been the point of overthrowing Khrushchev if not to revert to Stalinism?\\" As far as his own views on the role of Soviet policy went, Shelepin opposed the relaxation of tensions with the United States in foreign affairs, and favored a return to domestic policies that promoted discipline and centralization within the wider Union. Shelepin's reward was to be made a full member of the most important political body, the Politburo, in November 1964, following the successful overthrow of Khrushchev ‚Äîby a significant margin its youngest member, at the age of 46. But he still held ambitions of becoming the leader of the Soviet Union. Fall from power Shelepin's colleagues on the Politburo watched him carefully, seeking to halt his ambitions. So as to weaken his substantial power base, Shelepin was stripped of the Deputy Premiership at the end of 1965 and from 1965‚Äì1970 witnessed the systematic dismissal of his most powerful allies within the Party and Government. In May 1967, he lost all of his influence in the KGB, as Brezhnev replaced Semichastny with Yuri Andropov. Shelepin survived as a full member of the Politburo until 1975, when he rapidly fell from power, being successively demoted to a number of lower positions, until his retirement in 1984. Brezhnev was able to outmaneuver Shelepin, as his approach was more nuanced and more acceptable to the average Party official. Shelepin wanted centralization, discipline and strict oversight of officials domestically, and confrontation on all fronts with the United States abroad; whereas Brezhnev was happy to offer predictability, stability and job security to the party officials, and pursue a balanced foreign policy, combining d√©tente with proxy wars. Shelepin died in Moscow on 24 October 1994, at the age of 76, and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery.

An extension is under construction that will extend the line to the southwest connecting St. Louis Park, Hopkins, Minnetonka and Eden Prairie. The line follows the path of former Metro Transit bus route 16 along University Avenue and Washington Avenue (which runs from downtown Minneapolis through the University of Minnesota main campus). It is the second light-rail line in the region, after the Blue Line, which opened in 2004 and connects Minneapolis with the southern suburb of Bloomington. Construction on the Green Line began in late 2010. It opened to the public on June 14, 2014. The travel time between the downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul stops is about 46 minutes. The entire line originally operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but as of 2019 trains are replaced by buses from 2am to 4am on weekdays, In 2018, the line carried a total of 13.8 million passengers.  History  =Former streetcar and bus lines= The route is a descendant of the Twin City Rapid Transit Company's St. Paul-Minneapolis streetcar line, also referred to as the Interurban line. Streetcars became practical along the route with the advent of electrification, and full service began along the route on December 9, 1890. In the 1950s, a decision was made to convert the streetcar system to buses. Streetcar service along the Interurban line ended in Saint Paul on October 31, 1953, and the route was the last to carry passengers in the city. Service continued a short while longer in Minneapolis, until November 28.Olson. p. 65. However, due to fragmentary service elsewhere in Minneapolis, streetcars continued to use the tracks along University Avenue to reach the shops at Snelling Avenue in Saint Paul until June 1954. The route 16 bus was developed to replace the streetcar, and followed the route of the modern-day Green Line. Other parallel service included freeway express service on route 94 and limited-stop service to the University of Minnesota on route 50. Twin City Lines continued to privately operate buses until 1970, when the company was taken over by the Metropolitan Transit Commission, a precursor to Metro Transit. =Proposals= In 1972, the Regional Fixed Guideway Study for the Metropolitan Transit Commission (the forerunner of today's Metro Transit) proposed a $1.3 billion 37- or 57-mile (sources differ) heavy-rail rapid transit system, but the then-separate Metropolitan Council disagreed with that idea ‚Äì refusing to even look at the plan ‚Äì and continuing political battles meant that it was never implemented. The Met Council had its own plans for bus rapid transit in the metropolitan region. Another system using smaller people movers was proposed in the 1975 Small Vehicle Fixed Guideway Study and gained the most traction with the Saint Paul city council, but was eventually dropped in 1980. In the 1980s, light rail was proposed as an alternative and several possible corridors were identified, including the Central Corridor line which had a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) drawn up in 1982. It took another two decades before the Blue Line light rail line began operation. It began service on June 26, 2004, just over 50 years since the last regular- service streetcar ran on June 19, 1954. =Central Corridor Coordinating Committee= The Central Corridor Coordinating Committee was a workgroup in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area set up to explore transit options for the Central Corridor, the interurban corridor roughly following University Avenue in the Twin Cities area. After a long period of examination, this committee narrowed transit options for the corridor from a broad universe of choices to just three: a no-build option where services are only incrementally improved, a bus rapid transit (BRT) option, wherein buses run on semi-dedicated transitway, and a light rail transit (LRT) option using light rail vehicles (LRVs). In May 2006 the CCCC concluded its study by publishing a Draft Environmental Impact Study, which concluded that LRT was the best option for the corridor. After a period of public meetings and public comment, the CCCC recommended on June 6, 2006 that the Metropolitan Council select LRT as the locally preferred alternative for the corridor and apply for preliminary engineering to begin. On June 28, 2006, the Metropolitan Council concurred with the CCCC's decision and officially selected LRT as the locally preferred alternative. Metropolitan Council manages all transit, waterway, and other public resources for the seven-county area surrounding the Twin Cities, and as such, the Central Corridor project will now transition to Metropolitan Council. The work of the Central Corridor Coordinating Committee is now complete. =Funding= A 2003 study commissioned by the Central Corridor Coordinating Committee placed the cost at US$840 million. Cost estimates placed the cost of the light rail line in 2003, at about US$957 million, with the increase primarily due to inflation over the following decade. On June 6, 2006, the light rail option was endorsed by the Central Corridor Coordinating Committee. The Metropolitan Council gave final approval to this decision on June 28, 2006. The existing Blue Line has exceeded ridership predictions, as is the case with many other light rail lines constructed in the U.S. during the last decade. This led to some delays for the Central Corridor project because local transit officials were forced to retool ridership models before submitting projections to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The Metropolitan Council, which operates Metro Transit, submitted numbers showing that a light rail line would carry 43,000 passengers daily by the year 2030. The FTA agreed that the line would be cost-effective at this level, a key requirement for obtaining federal funding. In April 2008, Governor Tim Pawlenty initially vetoed $70 million in funding for the Central Corridor project, along with other items, from the state budget. The funding was part of a state-local package of $227 million necessary to get federal transportation funds, and the future of the project was in doubt until May 18, 2008, when a revised bonding bill including the $70 million for the Central Corridor was passed in the Legislature and signed into law by the governor. In August 2009 the Central Corridor project received a Record of Decision from the Federal Transit Administration. The FTA found the project to have fully and accurately completed its environmental documentation with the publication of the Final Environmental Impact statement earlier in the summer, thus clearing the project for final design. =Construction= Green Line under construction The first construction began in late 2010, including work in downtown St. Paul and near the University of Minnesota campus. By November 2011, construction was about 32% complete, including most heavy construction such as the installation of track segments, a new bridge, partial completion of stations, a rebuilt skyway in St. Paul and the construction of Green Line facilities at St. Paul Union Station. Due to scope of project, a venture was created by C.S. McCrossan and Ames to complete an area known as The Civil West Project. This area extended from the west side of the 35W abutment, over the Mississippi River, through the UofM campus and ending at Bedford St. From Bedford to Saint Paul, Walsh Construction served as the general contractor. In July 2011, the Metropolitan Council officially named the Central Corridor as the Green Line. As of August 2013, construction was completed and test trains began running over the line which opened to the public on June 14, 2014. An interesting component of the Green Line project was the complexities in design layout. Land surveyors worked directly with over twelve subcontractors to complete the work. A particular area required exclusive attention and support, that being outside the University of Minnesota's biology department. Between Pleasant and Harvard streets there was 1/8\\" of tolerance between design and as-builds. Control factors used in the biology labs would be impacted by the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the nearby light rail. The 1/8\\" tolerance is said to cancel out any EMR that the light rail may produce. = Additional stations = Central Station of the Green Line in downtown Saint Paul Some in favor of the line have expressed concern with the number of stations. The neighborhoods along University have demanded that the line have stations every half-mile, from Snelling to Rice Street, which would mean stations at Hamline Avenue, Victoria Street and Western Avenue. In February 2008, the Central Corridor Management Committee passed a resolution to include below-ground infrastructure for the Hamline, Victoria and Western stations \\"with the understanding that, if the CEI increases or other dollars are made available by mid-summer 2008, the first claim on those dollars would be one of the infill stations.\\" The Metropolitan Council has included this infrastructure work in their Draft Environmental Impact Statement and has also committed to building one station if any funds become available. As of 2009, the Federal Transit Administration has increased the Cost Effectiveness Index such that buildout of one station is now feasible. On January 25, 2010, the FTA announced that the three \\"infill\\" stations will be built. By 2016, five stations between Snelling and Rice Street were built - Hamline Ave, Lexington Pkwy, Victoria St, Dale St, and Western Ave.http://www.metrotransit.org/metro- green-line  Opposition  Many businesses along the line were opposed to its development because of reduced access for automobiles. Under the final plans, 87% of on-street parking disappeared along University Avenue between Raymond Avenue and Rice Street. At least one restaurant has cited light rail construction as a reason for closing. The corridor contains working-class residents and immigrant populations from Laos and Vietnam. Although the Green Line construction is mostly on an existing roadway and no land will be condemned, the disruption to existing transit and pedestrian ways was a concern to some groups. There is also concern that stops for light rail will be placed too far apart and along with reductions in bus service, transportation options for people will be reduced. Others are concerned about gentrification, where rising property values and taxes could force out lower- income residents. Others have opposed using Washington Avenue for a pedestrian transit mall and have opposed using the Washington Avenue bridge, citing traffic concerns, along with the age of the bridge, when other bridges upriver could be used to cross the Mississippi River: the 10th Avenue Bridge, the new I-35W bridge or the Northern Pacific Bridge Number 9. This last option was preferred by the University of Minnesota, which feared traffic disruption and vibration at some of their research facilities from use of the Washington Avenue route. In late summer 2008, preliminary engineering reports showed that mitigation work could negate the effects of vibrations on university laboratory equipment. The University of Minnesota renewed its objections over vibration concerns along Washington Avenue in late 2009. Negotiations between the Metropolitan Council and the university continued into early 2010. A compromise was reached between the University and the Metropolitan Council and the Washington Avenue bridge was selected for use. As of Summer 2011, work had begun on the Washington Avenue bridge. In January 2009, Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) raised concerns over the effects of the light-rail trains on their recording studios on Cedar Street in downtown St. Paul. MPR presented the results of an engineering study which they sponsored that conflicted with that performed by the Metropolitan Council. A settlement between MPR and other involved parties will keep the light rail trains on Cedar Street and will also compensate MPR for the addition of sound-proof upgrades to their studios.  Extension  The line is to be extended to Southwest Station in Eden Prairie along the Southwest LRT. The extension will add 16 additional stations and of trackage to the line, extending through St. Louis Park, Hopkins and Minnetonka. The estimated one-way travel time from Southwest Station in Eden Prairie to Target Field Station in Minneapolis is 32 minutes. Due to neighborhood opposition from the Kenwood neighborhood and additional studies on the environmental effects of the Southwest Corridor, the opening has been delayed to 2023.  Transit links  The Northstar Line commuter rail line connects downtown Minneapolis with northwestern suburbs, with a station at the north/western terminus of the Blue and Green Lines. The two light rail lines share trackage through downtown. The eastern terminus of the Green Line is a street level station in front of the Saint Paul Union Depot, considered one of the great architectural achievements in the city and formerly one of the main points of departure for area train riders up until passenger rail service in the United States was restructured in the 1960s and 1970s. The concourse of the Union Depot is planned to become a transfer point for people coming into St. Paul along the proposed Rush Line and Gold Line bus rapid transit lines. As of June 2014, Union Depot is a transit center for Metro Transit, MVTA, Jefferson Lines, Megabus, Greyhound buses and Amtrak's Empire Builder.  Bus service  Snelling Avenue Green Line station Metro Transit Route 16 parallels the Green Line between St. Paul and Fairview Ave Station. Route 50 formerly operated alongside Route 16 during weekdays, but with stops generally spaced about one-half mile apart. It was discontinued when the Green Line entered service. After the Green Line opened, Route 16 service was cut back from 1 AM to 5 AM, frequency was reduced to every 20 minutes and the route was truncated at the University of Minnesota. In 2010, route 16 had an operating budget of $10 million and generated $3.7 million in revenue (a farebox recovery ratio of 37%), while Route 50 had a 2010 budget of $3.5 million and generated $1.3 million in revenue (37% farebox recovery ratio). Route 16 carried about 5 million passengers, with weekday ridership averaging 16,880 and Saturday and Sunday ridership averaging 12,082 and 7,110, respectively. Route 50 carried about 1.5 million riders over the course of the year, with weekday ridership averaging 6,886. Metro Transit also provides weekday express bus service along Interstate 94 between the St. Paul and Minneapolis downtown areas.  Vehicles  Siemens Industry Incorporated built 47 S70 Light Rail Vehicles for the Green Line,http://www.metrotransit.org/new-light-rail- vehicles-begin-service at a per-LRV cost of $3,297,714 and a total contract value of $154,992,558. The LRVs were built in Florin, California and the first vehicle was delivered on October 10, 2012. Safety During testing of the Green line before it opened, there were four accidents recorded.Blume, Paul - New Green Line endures 4th crash before opening day KMSP Fox 9, June 9, 2014 One accident was at Portland Avenue and 5th Street in Downtown Minneapolis. This intersection was already in use by Blue Line and is now being shared by the Blue and Green Lines. The first death occurred in August 2014, when Shana Buchanan, former attorney, was struck by a train as she attempted to cross the tracks at Westgate Station.Lindberg, Joseph and Emily Gurnon -Woman killed by Green Line train was a former attorney. Pioneer Press, September 3, 2014 On April 30, 2015, the Minnesota Senate's office of counsel and research receptionist Lynne Thomas was the second pedestrian killed by a Green Line train since it began operating. On December 10, 2015, a third pedestrian, Nurto Abdi Aden, was struck and killed as she crossed the Green Line tracks near Hamline Avenue Station. On July 15, 2017 a fourth person, Nicholas Westlake, 29 had his car struck by a train and later died near University and Highway 280. Nic's girlfriend and ballroom dance partner Neli Petkova was in the passenger seat at the time of the collision and was subsequently treated for injuries and released from the hospital. In response to the Westlake crash, in which the train operator illegally ran a red light, Minnesota legislators changed a law that had previously prevented light-rail train operators from being charged in fatal collisions. A fifth victim, a female pedestrian, was struck and killed on January 28, 2018, near the intersection of University and Pascal Avenues in St. Paul. A sixth victim, a male runner, was struck and killed on October 8, 2018 near Hamline Avenue, he died at the hospital. A seventh person, a male pedestrian at the Stadium Village station near the University of Minnesota, was run over and killed by a departing train early on April 20, 2019, after he fell between two of its cars. On August 30, 2019, the eighth victim, a female pedestrian, was struck just after 3 p.m. at the Dale Street Station. She was walking north in a crosswalk on University Ave. when she was struck by a westbound train.

He is best known for his work on two licensed toy properties whose adventures occurred in the Marvel Universe: Micronauts and Rom, as well as co-creating the characters Rocket Raccoon and Cloak and Dagger. An attorney who worked as a public defender, Mantlo was the victim of a hit-and-run accident in 1992 and has been in institutional care ever since. Early life Bill Mantlo was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the oldest of three sons of William W. and Nancy Mantlo. Growing up as a comics fan, Mantlo attended Manhattan's High School of Art & Design. In college at the Cooper Union School of Art,\\"Micromails: Meet the Micro-Makers: Bill Mantlo,\\" Micronauts #7 (Marvel Comics, July 1979). he focused on painting and photography. Following his graduation, Mantlo held various civil service positions and worked as a portrait photographer. Career =Comics= A connection with a college friend in 1974 led Mantlo to a job as an assistant to Marvel Comics production manager John Verpoorten. Mantlo's first credits were as a colorist, on several comics cover-dated from October 1974 to April 1975. Soon afterword, Mantlo wrote a fill-in script for a Sons of the Tiger story in Deadly Hands of Kung Fu, which led to a permanent writing position on that title. While scripting Deadly Hands, Mantlo and artist George P√©rez created White Tiger, comics' first superhero of Hispanic descent. Around this time, Marvel's then editor- in-chief Marv Wolfman instituted a policy to avoid the many missed deadlines plaguing the company. The policy was to have fill-in stories at the ready, should a title be in danger of missing its deadline. Mantlo quickly became the \\"fill-in king\\", creating stories under very tight deadlines, many of which did find their way into print. By the mid to late 1970s he had written issues of nearly every Marvel title. Later, he became a regular writer at Marvel, notably for the licensed properties Micronauts and Rom,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 191: \\"Prolific writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema created a Marvel comics series and a whole mythology around Parker Brothers' toy 'ROM'.\\" also known as Rom: Spaceknight. Mantlo recalled how one Christmas, he examined some action figures from Mego Corporation's Micronauts line, given to his son Adam. He said he began to envision the characters \\"as small, microscopic even, inhabiting an other-verse apart from, but conjunctive with ours,\\" and specified that, Mantlo convinced then-editor-in-chief Jim Shooter to obtain the comics license for these toys; Shooter then hired Mantlo to script their series. Mantlo and artist Michael Golden created the Micronauts' backstory of history, mythology, personalities, and an alphabet. Micronauts, along with Moon Knight and Ka-Zar the Savage, became one of Marvel's first ongoing series to be distributed exclusively to comic book stores beginning with issue #38 (Feb. 1982). Mantlo's first run on The Spectacular Spider-Man featured frequent appearances by the White Tiger. He used the series to wrap up unresolved plot elements from The Champions seriesManning \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 101: \\"Bill Mantlo was the regular scribe of both Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man and The Champions...The Champions had recently been cancelled, and Mantlo decided to tie up a few of the title's loose ends in his other comic.\\" and wrote a multiple-issue storyline that included the first work by artist Frank Miller on the Daredevil character. Mantlo concluded his first run on the series with a crossover with the Fantastic Four #218 (May 1980).Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 113: \\"In the conclusion to a tale that had begun in the pages of Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #42 (May), writer [Bill] Mantlo and artist John Byrne had the latest incarnation of the Frightful Four face off against their Fantastic counterparts. Mantlo, Mark Gruenwald, and Steven Grant co-wrote Marvel Treasury Edition #25 (1980) which featured a new story starring Spider- Man vs. the Hulk set at the 1980 Winter Olympics.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 113: \\"Spider-Man's fights with the Incredible Hulk were always popular with the fans, so Marvel decided to pitch the wall-crawler against the Hulk when the Mole Man and his gang of villains crashed the festivities of the prestigious Winter Olympics.\\" While writing The Champions he collaborated with artist Bob Hall, who said in 2013, \\"Bill was a peach ‚Äî very helpful to me as I got started [in the comics profession] ... I think we were both as enthusiastic as we could get about this particular comic, but more because we were working at Marvel than because of the book itself.\\" Mantlo began writing The Incredible Hulk with issue #245 (March 1980). His five-year run on the series was noted for his depiction of the Hulk as highly emotional and humanized, rather than bestial and savage. Among the adversaries he created for the series were the U-FoesDeFalco, Tom \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 199: \\"Inspired by the 1979 Graham Parker song 'Waiting for the UFOs', the creation of the U-Foes was truly a team effort. Writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema produced the first U-Foes story, but editor Al Milgrom helped design the costumes and Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter suggested some of the names.\\" and the Soviet Super-Soldiers.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 201: \\"The Soviet Super-Soldiers, the Russian equivalent of the Avengers, were a team of super-powered individuals assembled by the Soviet government in this issue by writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema.\\" Summarizing his early years with the Hulk, Mantlo remarked, \\"I did retreads of old Hulk stories to try and find a new direction, and just kept doing more and more repetition of what had already happened. Then [editor] Al Milgrom said, ‚ÄòWell, don‚Äôt accept this. If you want to make changes, make them. Take some risks.‚Äô That‚Äôs when we decided to give Hulk Bruce Banner‚Äôs intelligence. From that point on I felt as if I had finally had a direction and control over the character. So I guess I took a year and half or maybe two years to get to the point.\\" Mantlo and artist Ed Hannigan co-created the superhero pair Cloak and DaggerDeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 207: \\"Cloak and Dagger's first appearance was written by Bill Mantlo and illustrated by Ed Hannigan. A socially conscious writer, Mantlo used the characters to address the problems of teenage runaways and the dangers of illegal drugs.\\" in The Spectacular Spider-Man #64 (March 1982). Mantlo, Gruenwald, and Grant reunited to co-write Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions,DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 208: \\"Plotted by Mark Gruenwald, Steven Grant, and Bill Mantlo, and penciled by John Romita, Jr., Contest of Champions eventually saw print in June 1982.\\" the first limited series published by Marvel Comics. Other work by Mantlo includes runs as the regular writer on Iron Man and Alpha Flight. =Public defender= By the mid-1980s, he was enrolled in law school. Though he continued writing for Marvel, his workload began to decrease due to disputes with management. He wrote briefly for DC Comics in 1988, scripting the Invasion! miniseries. By this time he had passed the bar exam, and in 1987 began working as a Legal Aid Society public defender in The Bronx. Personal life Mantlo was married to Karen Mantlo (n√©e Pocock), for some years a letterer in the comics industry. They have a son, Adam, and a daughter, Corinna (born 1980).Shooter, Jim. \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\", Iron Man #148 (July 1981) and other Marvel Comics titles published that month. On July 17, 1992, Mantlo was struck by a car while rollerblading. The driver of the car fled the scene and was never identified. Mantlo suffered severe head trauma. According to his biographer, cartoonist David Yurkovich, in 2006, \\"For a while Bill was comatose. Although no longer in a coma, the brain damage he suffered in the accident is irreparable. His activities of daily living are severely curtailed and he resides in a healthcare facility where he receives full-time care.\\" As Mantlo's brother and guardian Michael described the injury: \\"Bill is, and has been, trapped in a world of confusion and despair since his accident. The cognitive deficits he suffered have left him unable to reason or understand his situation, and he struggles daily to maintain any control over his own mind. For someone with his intellect and imagination, this was the absolute worst type of injury that could ever have happened to him. Awards Micronauts won the 1979 Eagle Award for Favourite New Comic Title. In 2014, Mantlo received the Bill Finger Award.

Parking parallel to a car already parked at the curb Cars double-parked on New York City street in the 1970s The car in the cycling lane is double-parked. \\"Double parking\\" means standing or parking a vehicle on the roadway side of a vehicle already stopped, standing or parked at the curb.New York City Violation Codes, Fines, Rules & Regulations (\\"double parking\\" is code 46) This often prevents some of the vehicles in the first row from departing and always obstructs a traffic lane or bike lane (to the extent of often making the street impassable in one- way single-lane situations). In some areas, people double parking their cars leave the hand brake off, allowing the drivers of the cars next to the curb to push the double parked car a little forward or backward, in order to allow departing from the parking spot. Double parking in this fashion, where illegal, is often punished by ticketing or towing the offending vehicle. In some urban areas where parking is extremely hard to obtain, courier and delivery services will instruct their drivers that if necessary they may double park anyway, and if ticketed to simply turn it in at the end of their shift. The practice is so common that Washington DC permits companies to establish a monthly billing account for all of their vehicles that receive any parking tickets. Double parking in attended car parks and garages Attended car parks and garages frequently use double parking to maximize vehicle storage density. A driver who double-parks in an attended car park leaves the vehicle's keys with the attendant. If the driver of the blocked car returns first, then the attendant can move the blocking car so that the blocked car can leave. This practice is especially common for valet car parks, in which attendants have the keys to all vehicles. Multi-space parking A Ford Mustang occupying two spaces at Vaughan Mills mall, Ontario. The term \\"double parking\\" even though it is not the legal term, is sometimes used to describe parking over the lines separating two designated parking spaces in a parking lot and is derived from situations where cars take more spaces than necessary; this is more accurately known as multi-space parking. Though this practice is most commonly a result of the driver disregarding the separating lines, it may also occur when the driver avoids parking too close to a large vehicle (such as a truck or SUV) in a narrow space, or to a vehicle which is poorly centered in the adjacent space. Sometimes, parking in this fashion, if the vehicle is large, is an attempt by the driver of the vehicle to avoid damage to the vehicle or to nearby vehicles when the doors are opened, or to ensure enough space for loading or unloading various content. The egregiousness of parking in this fashion is usually judged depending on parking space availability. It can provoke anger and even vandalism towards the offending vehicle when parking is scarce.

His works redefined business and economic history of industrialization. He received the Pulitzer Prize for History for his work, The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business (1977). He has been called \\"the doyen of American business historians\\".https://www.economist.com/news/books-and- arts/21727049-1865-1896-saw-tumultuous-changes-new-oxford-history-united- states Family and life Chandler was the great-grandson of Henry Varnum Poor. \\"Du Pont\\" was apparently a family name given to his grandfather because his great-grandmother was raised by the Du Pont family, and there are other connections as well.Carol May, \\"Alfred du Pont Chandler Jr.,\\" Edmund's Community Courier (Edmund Chandler Family Association), March 2, 2010. Chandler graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1936 and Harvard College in 1940. After World War II, he returned to Harvard, finished his M.A. in 1946, and earned his doctorate in 1952 under the direction of Frederick Merk. He taught at M.I.T. and Johns Hopkins University before arriving at Harvard Business School in 1970. Publications Chandler used the papers of his ancestor Henry Varnum Poor, a leading analyst of the railway industry, the publisher of the American Railroad Journal, and a founder of Standard & Poor's, as a basis for his Ph.D. thesis. Chandler began looking at large-scale enterprise in the early 1960s. His book Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise (1962) examined the organization of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, General Motors, and Sears, Roebuck and Co. He found that managerial organization developed in response to the corporation's business strategy. The book was voted the eleventh most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management. This emphasis on the importance of a cadre of managers to organize and run large-scale corporations was expanded into a \\"managerial revolution\\" in The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business (1977) for which he received a Pulitzer Prize. He pursued that book's themes further in Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, (1990) and co-edited an anthology on the same themes, with Franco Amatori and Takashi Hikino, Big Business and the Wealth of Nations (1997). The Visible Hand Chandler's masterwork was The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business (1977). His first two chapters looked at traditional owner-operated small business operations in commerce and production, including the largest among them, the slave plantations in the South. Chapters 3-5 summarize the history of railroad management, with stress on innovations not just in technology but also in accounting, finance and statistics. He then turned to the new business operations made possible by the rail system in mass distribution, such as jobbers, department stores and mail order. A quick survey (ch 8) review mass innovation in mass production.The integration of mass distribution and mass production (ch 9-11) led to many mergers and the emergence of giant industrial corporations by 1900. Management for Chandler was much more than the CEO, it was the whole system of techniques and included middle management (ch 11) as well as the corporate structure of the biggest firms, Standard Oil, General Electric, US Steel, and DuPont (ch 13-14). Chandler argued that managerial firms evolved in order to take advantage of productive techniques available after the rail network was in place. These firms had a higher productivity and lower costs resulting in higher profits. The firms created the \\"managerial class\\" in America because they needed to coordinate the increasingly complex and interdependent system. According to Steven Usselman, this ability to achieve efficiency through coordination, and not some anti-competitive monopolistic greed by robber barons, explained the high levels of concentration in modern American industry.Steven W. Usselman, \\"Still Visible: Alfred D. Chandler's The Visible Hand,\\" Technology and Culture 47, no. 3 (2006), 584-596. Organizational synthesis Along with economist Oliver E. Williamson and historians Louis Galambos, Robert H. Wiebe, and Thomas C. Cochran, Chandler was a leading historian of the notion of organizational synthesis. He argued that during the 19th century, the development of new systems based on steam power and electricity created a Second Industrial Revolution, which resulted in much more capital-intensive industries than had the industrial revolution of the previous century. The mobilization of the capital necessary to exploit these new systems required a larger number of workers and managers, and larger physical plants than ever before. More particularly, the thesis of The Visible Hand is that, counter to other theses regarding how capitalism functions, administrative structure and managerial coordination replaced Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" (market forces) as the core developmental and structuring impetus of modern business. In the wake of this increase of industrial scale, three successful models of capitalism emerged, which Chandler associated with the three leading countries of the period: Great Britain (\\"personal capitalism\\"), the United States (\\"competitive capitalism\\") and Germany (\\"cooperative capitalism.\\") Despite the important differences in these three models, the common thread among the developed nations is that the large industrial firm has been the engine of growth in three ways: first, it has provided focal points for capital and labor on large scales; second, it became the educator whereby a nation learned the pertinent technology and developed managerial skills; third, it served as the core around which medium and small firms that supply and serve it grew. Influence Chandler's work was somewhat ignored in history departments, but proved influential in business, economics, and sociology.Thomas K. McCraw, \\"Alfred Chandler: His Vision and Achievement,\\" Business History Review, Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 207-226 In the business field, Chandler, along with Kenneth R. Andrews and Igor Ansoff, has been credited with the foundational role in introducing and popularizing the concept of business strategy.Schendel, Dan E., and Hofer, Charles W., 1979, Strategic management. A new view of business policy and planning, Little Brown, Boston, p. 9.Hatten, Kenneth J., Schendel, Dan E., and Cooper, Arnold C., 1978, A strategic model of the U.S. brewing industry: 1952-1971, Academy of Management Journal, vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 594.Huff, Anne Sigismund, and Reger, Rhonda Kay, 1987, A review of strategic process research, Journal of Management, vol. 13, no. 2, p. 211.McKiernan, Peter, 1997, Strategy past; strategy futures, Long Range Planning, vol. 30, no. 5, p. 792 Chamberlain's Theory of Strategy cites Chandler's Strategy and Structure repeatedly as a source of key concepts.Chamberlain, Geoffrey P., 2010, Understanding Strategy, CreateSpace, Charleston, SC. In sociology, prior to Chandler's research, some sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. Chandler's focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences, and this thesis has influenced organizational sociologists' work since the late 1970s. It also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique Chandler's work more closely, turning up instances in which Chandler assumed American corporations acted for reasons of efficiency, when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict.Neil Fligstein, \\"Chandler and the Sociology of Organizations,\\" Business History Review, Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 241-250 See also * Business history * Second Industrial Revolution * James Burnham Bibliography * Chandler, Alfred D. \\"The beginnings of 'big business' in American industry\\" Business History Review 33#1 (1959): 1-31. * Chandler, Alfred D.

He was married to artist Olga Milles and brother to Ruth Milles and half brother to the architect Evert Milles. Carl Milles sculpted the Gustaf Vasa statue at the Stockholm Nordic Museum, the Poseidon statue in Gothenburg, the Orpheus group outside the Stockholm Concert Hall, and the Fountain of Faith in Falls Church, Virginia. His home near Stockholm, Millesg√•rden, became his resting place and is now a museum.  Biography  Milles (June 23, 1875 ‚Äì September 19, 1955) was born Carl Wilhelm Andersson, son of lieutenant Emil \\"Mille\\" Andersson and his wife Walborg Tisell, at Lagga outside Uppsala in 1875. In 1897 he made what he thought would be a temporary stop in Paris on his way to Chile, where he was due to manage a school of gymnastics. However, he remained in Paris, where he studied art, working in Auguste Rodin's studio and slowly gaining recognition as a sculptor. In 1904 he and Olga moved to Munich. Two years later they settled in Sweden, buying property on Herserud Cliff on Liding√∂, a large island near Stockholm. Millesg√•rden was built there between 1906 and 1908 as the sculptor's private residence and workspace. It was turned into a foundation and donated to the Swedish people in 1936. In 1931, American publisher George Gough Booth brought Milles to Cranbrook Educational Community, in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, to serve as his sculptor in residence. Part of Booth's arrangement with his principal artists was that they were expected to create major commissions outside the Cranbrook environment. Sculpture at Fort Christina In 1938, for the 300th anniversary of the founding of New Sweden, the country commissioned a sculpture by Milles featuring a replica of the Kalmar Nyckel, the ship which originally brought the Swedish colonists to America. The sculpture is located at Fort Christina in Wilmington, Delaware, near the landing site where the colonists arrived in 1638. In America he is best known for his fountains. Milles's fountain group The Wedding of the Waters in St. Louis symbolizes the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers merging just upstream. Commissioned in 1936 and unveiled in May 1940 to a crowd of about 3000 people, the fountain caused a local uproar because of its playful, irreverent, naked, and nearly cartoonish figures, and because Milles had conceived the group as a wedding party. Local officials insisted that the name be changed to The Meeting of the Waters. Outside Detroit's Frank Murphy Hall of Justice is a Carl Milles statue, The Hand of God, which was sculpted in honor of Frank Murphy, Detroit Mayor, Michigan Governor, and United States Supreme Court Associate Justice. The statue was placed on a pedestal with the help of sculptor Marshall Fredericks. The statue was commissioned by the United Automobile Workers, and paid for by individual donations from UAW members. The Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research, an annual award for research on entrepreneurship, consists of a replica statuette of The Hand of God and a prize of 100,000 euros. Milles's sculptures sometimes offended American sensibilities, and he had a 'fig leaf' maker on retainer. Milles Indian head Photographs of his sculptures, taken for a monograph on Milles, are now held in the Carl Milles Photograph Collection, c. 1938‚Äì1939, in the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. Milles and his wife returned to Sweden in 1951, and lived in Millesg√•rden every summer until Milles's death in 1955. They spent winters in Rome, where the American Academy had supplied them with a studio. Milles and his wife, Olga, who died in 1967 in Graz, Austria, are buried in a small stone chapel, designed by Milles, at Millesg√•rden. Because Swedish law requires burial on sacred ground, it took the assistance of the then reigning Gustaf VI Adolf to allow this resting place.

In the vicinity of Lugoff, US 601 encounters Interstate 20 at exit 92 near then begins another short overlap with US 1 which last until Camden where that concurrency is replaced by US 521 which last slightly longer than the previous one, ending in Kershaw. The route joins SC 9 three miles west of Pageland, then leaves SC 9 when it arrives in downtown Pageland before eventually crossing the North Carolina border. =North Carolina= After crossing the north-South Carolina border, US 601 intersects with such highways as US 74 in Monroe, which it shares a short concurrency with until the interchange with the northern terminus of NC 207\\\\. Just as it leaves the city limits, it runs past the site of a future interchange with the Monroe Bypass. Traveling north along what is now known as \\"Concord Highway\\" it encounters another intersection with the NC 24/NC 27 overlap in Midland and later an interchange with NC 49 south of Concord. Also in Concord, it joins US 29 which it overlaps until Interstate 85 at Exit 58 and runs along the interstate until it reaches Salisbury, at exit 75, then joins a brief concurrency with US 70\\\\. In Mocksville, the road has a short concurrency with US 64 beginning at the western terminus of US 158, and after leaving that overlap encounters Interstate 40 at exit 170. Further north it has an interchange with US 421 in Yadkinville, Interstate 74 at exit 11 near White Plains, and finally terminates at US 52 in Mount Airy. History Established in 1927 as an original US Highway; the original routing was from US 1, in Cheraw, to US 17/US 76, in Florence. In 1932, US 601 was extended north into North Carolina, replacing SC 96\\\\. In North Carolina US 601 was placed on concurrency with almost all of NC 80, from the South Carolina state line, near McFarlan, to downtown Mount Airy. In 1934, NC 80 was expunged from US 601. In 1935, most of US 601 was replaced by the arrival of US 52\\\\. From Salisbury, North Carolina to Florence, South Carolina, the route was converted to US 52; which marked its departure from South Carolina. Around 1952, US 601 was extended south from Salisbury. Starting with a concurrency with US 29 to Kannapolis, from there it followed US 29A to downtown Concord. Replacing NC 151, it continues south through Monroe and to the state line. In South Carolina, US 601 returns by replacing SC 151 from the border to Pageland. From there it replaced SC 902 and part of SC 265 to Kershaw. Between Kershaw and Camden, it overlaps with US 521, replacing SC 26 (SC 52 before 1935) from Camden to Orangeburg, then in concurrency with US 301 to Bamberg. Then finally replacing SC 36 to US 321, where it continues and ends with US 321 in Hardeeville. In 1965, US 601 was realigned on new road bypassing west of downtown Concord, leaving a business loop. In 1970, US 601 was realigned on new road bypassing east of Dobson, leaving a business loop. In 1974, US 601 was extended to Interstate 95 in Hardeeville; however, by 1977, US 601 was truncated to its current southern terminus at US 321, near Tarboro. In 1979, US 601 was rerouted west of Salisbury, with concurrency with US 70; Innis Street was downgraded to secondary status. In the late 1980s, US 601 was rerouted onto Interstate 85, in Salisbury from exit 68 to exit 74; which was extended in the late 1990s, going south to exit 58 in Concord. In 1999, US 601 was truncated to its current northern terminus at US 52 in Mount Airy.

The U.S. Highway runs from US 17 and US 17 Alternate in Georgetown, South Carolina north to US 301, North Carolina Highway 96 (NC 96), and Interstate 95 (I-95) near Four Oaks, North Carolina. US 701 serves the Pee Dee region of South Carolina and the southern and central portions of Eastern North Carolina. The highway connects Georgetown and Conway in South Carolina with the North Carolina cities of Whiteville, Elizabethtown, Clinton, and a short distance north of its terminus, Smithfield. US 701 has four business routes in North Carolina, including those through Tabor City, Whiteville, Clarkton, and Clinton. Route description US 701 has a length of in South Carolina and spans in North Carolina. The U.S. Highway is a part of the National Highway System for one short stretches during its concurrency with NC 24 in Clinton. =South Carolina= US 701 begins at an intersection with US 17 and US 17 Alternate, which has its northern terminus, in the city of Georgetown. US 17 follows Fraser Street south and Church Street east from the intersection; US 17 Alternate follows Exchange Street west toward Highmarket Street, on which US 521 also runs and has its southern terminus at US 17 one block to the south. US 701 heads north as a four-lane road with center turn lane along Fraser Street. Shortly after leaving the city, the highway meets the southern end of SC 51 (Browns Ferry Road) and reduces to two lanes. US 701 passes the entrances to several former plantations, including Mansfield Plantation, before crossing the Black River at the hamlet of Campfield. The highway passes along the eastern edge of the Carvers Bay Preserve, which protects the namesake swamp area and Carolina Bay. US 701 passes through Plantersville and meets the eastern end of SC 261 (Pleasant Hill Drive) at Yauhannah before crossing the Georgetown-Horry county line at the Pee Dee River. US 701 passes by the villages of Bucksport, Bucksville--the site of Hebron Church and Buck's Upper Mill Farm-- and Toddville as the highway roughly parallels the Waccamaw River north to Conway. On entering the city limits, the U.S. Highway follows 4th Avenue and expands to a four-lane road with center turn lane. US 701 meets US 501 (Church Street), US 378 (Wright Boulevard), and SC 905 (4th Avenue) at a triangular junction southwest of downtown. US 701 has ramps to and from southbound US 501 just before passing under the highway; southbound US 701 uses the exit ramp from US 501 while northbound US 701 continues to its intersection with US 378. SC 905 begins and heads into the Conway Downtown Historic District while US 701 makes a sharp turn west to join US 378 for a short concurrency to the latter highway's junction with US 501, where northbound US 701 joins the southbound direction and US 501 on Church Street. US 701 and US 501 head north on Church Street, a four-lane road with center turn lane, to 16th Avenue, a four-lane street onto which US 701 turns east and runs concurrently with US 501 Business. The concurrency ends at Main Street, where the business route turns south onto Main Street toward downtown and US 701 turns north onto the street, which expands from two to four lanes north of the intersection, to head out of the city. The U.S. Highway parallels the Waccamaw Coast Line Railroad north through the village of Homewood, where the highway meets the eastern end of SC 319 and reduces to two lanes, then gradually splits away from the railroad on its way to a partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 22 (Veterans Highway). At its intersection with SC 410 (Green Sea Road), US 701 veers northeast, has an oblique grade crossing of the railroad, and parallels the rail line to the city of Loris. The U.S. Highway passes through Loris as Broad Street, which intersects SC 9 Business (Main Street). US 701 leaves Loris and parallels the railroad north through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 9 to just south of the South Carolina-North Carolina state line. =North Carolina= Just south of the northwest-southeast state line, US 701 veers northeast to bypass Tabor City while US 701 Business follows Hickman Road parallel to the railroad toward the center of the town in Columbus County immediately to the north of the state line. The bypass intersects NC 904 (Pireway Road) before meeting the north end of the business route and NC 410 (5th Avenue) on the eastern edge of town. US 701 has a short concurrency with NC 410 before that highway splits north as Joe Brown Highway. The U.S. Highway heads northeast as James B. White Highway through the hamlet of Sydney before reaching the south end of the city of Whiteville. There, US 701 Business splits to the east as Madison Street while the mainline continues as J.K. Powell Boulevard. Just north of the business route split, US 701 meets NC 130 (Love Mill Road) and runs concurrently with the highway along a two- lane road with center turn lane. The highways cross Soules Swamp and intersects the Carolina Southern Railroad at grade, then pass through Whiteville's main street grid. West of the city center, US 701 and NC 130 intersect US 74 Business and US 76 Business (Washington Street), which NC 130 joins heading west toward Chadbourn. North of downtown, US 701 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 74 and US 76 (Andrew Jackson Highway), a freeway that will carry I-74 in the future. North of Whiteville, two-lane US 701 collects the northern end of US 701 Business and continues the business route's name of James B. White Highway. The highway veers northeast as its junction with NC 131 (Bladenboro Road) at Western Prong. US 701 Business splits to the northeast just before both highways enter Bladen County. US 701 follows W.R. Latham Street through the town of Clarkton, where the highway intersects NC 211 (Green Street) and CSX's Wilmington Subdivision. North of town, US 701 collects the northern end of its business route, College Street, crosses Brown Marsh Swamp, and passes to the west of the historic Brown Marsh Presbyterian Church. The highway continues north to Elizabethtown, on the southern edge of which US 701 intersects and becomes concurrent with NC 242 and has a junction with NC 87, which bypasses the town to the south. The U.S. Highway passes through town as Poplar Street, which intersects NC 87 Business in the center of town; there, NC 41 joins US 701 and NC 242 as they exit the town on a four-lane divided highway that crosses the Cape Fear River. North- south NC 242 splits from US 701 and NC 41 at the same three-way intersection east-west NC 53 joins the highways to pass through Bladen Lakes State Forest, which is named for several Carolina Bays known collectively as the Bladen Lake Group. US 701, NC 41, and NC 53 head east as a two-lane road to the town of White Lake, which surrounds the namesake lake. The two state highways separate from the U.S. Highway at separate intersections in the town. US 701 heads north and intersects NC 210 before crossing the South River into Sampson County. The highway's name becomes Garland Highway with local variation through the town of Garland, where it follows Ingold Street and intersects NC 411 (2nd Street). US 701 crosses Great Coharie Creek, passes along the edge of the unincorporated community of Ingold, and through the hamlet of Butlers Crossroads. On the southern edge of Clinton, US 701 meets US 421 at a partial cloverleaf interchange; US 701 Business heads straight on Southeast Boulevard while the U.S. Highways head northwest together on the four-lane Faircloth Freeway. The freeway has a three-ramp diamond interchange with Tram Road--the missing ramp is from Tram Road to northbound US 701--just east of a partial interchange with NC 24 where the state highway joins the freeway. Access from northbound US 701 and US 421 to eastbound NC 24 and from westbound NC 24 to southbound US 701 and US 421 is provided via Tram Road. NC 24 splits from the U.S. Highways at the diamond interchange with Sunset Avenue, which the state highway follows west out of the city. US 421 splits from US 701 from a partial interchange where US 421 exits onto Northwest Boulevard to head toward Dunn. Access from southbound US 701 to northbound US 421 and from southbound US 421 to northbound US 701 via North Boulevard, which US 701 meets at the next diamond interchange. The freeway ends where US 701 meets the northern end of US 701 Business and takes over two-lane Hobbton Highway. US 701 continues through the villages of Keener and Hobbton and meets I-40 at a partial cloverleaf interchange between Monks Crossroads and the town of Newton Grove. In the center of town, the U.S. Highway meets US 13, NC 50, and NC 55 at a six-legged roundabout known as Weeks Circle. US 701 follows Clinton Street south of the circle and Main Street to the north. US 13 uses Fayetteville Street on the southwest leg of the roundabout and Goldsboro Highway to the northeast. NC 50 and NC 55 together use Raleigh Street on the northwest branch of the circle and Mount Olive Drive on the southeast leg. Just after leaving the town limits, US 701 enters Johnston County. The highway passes to the west of the Bentonville Battlefield and through the hamlets of Overshot and Strickland Crossroads before reaching its northern terminus on the eastern edge of Four Oaks. US 701 has a four-way intersection with NC 96, which receives the northbound I-95 exit ramp, and Devils Racetrack Road, which leads to the northbound entrance ramp. US 701 and NC 96 cross over I-95 together at Exit 90 and US 701 has its terminus at their intersection with US 301. NC 96 continues north with US 301 toward Smithfield and US 301 heads southwest on its own toward the center of Four Oaks, providing access to the southbound I-95 interchange ramps just west of US 701. History Established in 1932, US 701 began in Charleston, at the intersection with US 17 (King Street) then proceeded east over the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge into Mount Pleasant. Continuing north, it went through Georgetown, Conway before entering North Carolina. Its routing in South Carolina was in complete concurrency with SC 40, which was removed in 1933. In North Carolina, also in a complete concurrency with NC 23, it traversed through Tabor City, Whiteville, Elizabethtown, Clinton, Newton Grove and ending south of Smithfield. In 1935, US 17 was rerouted to overlap with US 701 between Charleston and Georgetown. Between Clinton and Newton Grove, US 701 was straighten, leaving behind various secondary roads in the area. By 1948, US 701 was placed on a new routing along Southeast and Northeast Boulevards, leaving behind US 701A. In 1950, US 701 was rerouted from Conway to Tabor City, leaving behind today's SC 410\\\\. In 1956, US 701 was placed on new bypass west of Whiteville, its old route eventually became US 701 Bus. In 1957, US 701 was placed on a new bypass east of Tabor City, leaving behind what became US 701 Bus; also same year a new bypass was constructed west of Clarkton, its old route also becoming US 701 Bus. Around 1965, US 701 was placed on new bypass south of Ingold, its old alignment becoming secondary road. In 1967, US 17/US 701 was bypassed north of Mount Pleasant, leaving behind US 17 Bus/US 701 Bus. On March 1973, US 701 was placed on US 421's western bypass of Clinton, leaving behind US 701 Bus. In 1992, US 701's southern terminus was truncated in Georgetown, leaving behind a solo US 17 to Charleston. =North Carolina Highway 23= NC 23 was an original state highway. In 1922 it was routed from the South Carolina Border to NC 22 in Dublin. In 1924 NC 70 was given the part of NC 23 from Lumberton to the South Carolina Border. In 1925 NC 23 was extended north along NC 21 to Elizabethtown. It then was placed on new routing from Elizabethtown to NC 60 south of Clinton. In 1928 NC 23 was removed from its routing from Elizabethtown to Lumberton. Instead NC 23 replaced NC 21 to Whiteville then was placed on new routing to Tabor City where it met up with South Carolina Highway 40. In 1930 NC 23 was extended through Clinton along NC 60 then went north on new road to Newton Grove. NC 23 then replaced NC 220 through both Smithfield and Selma before the road ended at NC 91 near Zebulon. In 1932 US 701 was assigned the routing from the South Carolina State Line to US 301 near Smithfield. In 1933 NC 23 was extended through Zebulon to Louisburg. In 1934 NC 23 was dropped from the routing that US 701 was also along. The rest was renumbered NC 39. =South Carolina Highway 40= South Carolina Highway 40 (SC 40) was an original South Carolina highway that began in Mount Pleasant and traversed north through McClellanville, Georgetown, Conway, and Green Sea before heading into North Carolina at Tabor City. By 1926, a ferry was put in service connecting Mount Pleasant to Charleston, near the Custom House. In 1929, SC 40 was placed on the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge into Charleston, ending at SC 2 (King Street). In 1932, US 701 was assigned to the entirety of SC 40; which was decommissioned a year later. Major Intersections Special routes Five special routes currently exist for US 701\\\\. There are business loops of US 701 serving the North Carolina municipalities of Tabor City, Whiteville, Clarkton, and Clinton. In South Carolina, a short truck route exists north of the city of Conway. An alternate route once existed in Clinton, North Carolina and a business loop once served Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.

The first car is being followed very closely by another. Tailgating is when a driver drives behind another vehicle while not leaving sufficient distance to stop without causing a collision if the vehicle in front stops suddenly. The safe distance for following another vehicle varies depending on various factors including vehicle speed, weather, visibility and other road conditions. Some jurisdictions may require a minimal gap of a specified distance or time interval. When following heavy vehicles or in less than ideal conditions (e.g. low light or rain), a longer distance is recommended. Causes There can be several reasons for tailgating. =Preventing cut ins= Tailgating can occur when a vehicle attempts to prevent another vehicle on the right or left from cutting in front of them. The tailgating (or preventing) vehicle will drive as close as possible to another leading vehicle to prevent the side vehicle from cutting in. Like all forms, this practice of tailgating is illegal and attempts to force the side vehicle to slow down and get into the line of traffic behind the tailgating vehicle. This practice is very likely to evoke road rage where one vehicle is blocking and another attempts to defy the block. =Negligence= Tailgating can occur because of a lack of perceived risk in so doing. Thus, it is done unconsciously or negligently, very often by people who consider themselves safe drivers and generally obey some other rules of the road. Evidence shows that more experienced drivers are more likely to be involved in rear-end collisions, possibly because they overestimate their skill and become complacent about allowing sufficient distance to avoid an accident.rms.nsw.gov.au =Coercion= In its most uncivil form, it can be a case of road rage and/or intimidation. An example would be where the tailgating driver (the driver in the following vehicle) threatens damage to the leading vehicle and its occupants by driving aggressively ‚Äî perhaps also with use of headlights and horn ‚Äî to coerce the leading vehicle's driver into getting out of the way. The driver being tailgated might not wish to comply, especially if doing so would involve breaking the law, such as by increasing speed beyond the speed limit or changing lanes without due regard for safety. Note, however, that in some jurisdictions (E.g., India) flashing high beams is a normal and polite method used to signal the intention to overtake. =Aerodynamics= A form of deliberate tailgating known as slipstreaming, \\"draft-assisted forced stop\\", or \\"draft-assisted forced auto stop\\" (D-FAS) is a technique used by some hypermilers to achieve greater fuel economy. D-FAS involves turning off the engine and gliding in neutral while tailgating a larger vehicle in order to take advantage of the reduced wind resistance in its immediate wake.motherjones.com Note that this practice is extremely dangerous: while tailgating itself is inherently risky, the danger of collision is increased with D-FAS as power for power brakes can be lost after a few applications of the brake pedal and, with older cars, the pressure that causes power steering to function can be lost as well.motherjones.com, King of the hypermilers-2 =Trailing and columns= Another instance whereby the practice of driving on a road very close to a frontward vehicle or at a close distance may occur is during an occasion whereby the drivers of the two cars are acquainted to one another. This may be due to it being a procession of motor vehicles, typically carrying or escorting a prominent person that wants to avoid interlopers. Another instance may occur where the leading vehicle is showing directions to the trailing vehicle and the trailing vehicle attempts to avoid allowing an interloping vehicle to come in between them. Another sphere wherein tailgating has been observed is among drivers who are in a hurry, or other public road activity whose prerequisite is urgency or agitation. Hazards of tailgating Tailgating can be dangerous to the tailgater, especially if they are driving closely behind a large vehicle (such as a tractor-trailer, or gas tanker). By tailgating, the driver has a shorter distance to stop, decreases the margin of error and blocks the awareness of surroundings. If the leading vehicle decelerates suddenly (such as when encountering a traffic jam, traffic lights, avoiding pedestrians, etc.), the tailgater has a high risk of causing a rear-end collision, for which in insurance terms, he would always be held responsible. In many jurisdictions, a two second gap is recommended between any two successive moving vehicles, characterised in Britain by the slogan, \\"only a fool breaks the two second rule\\". Fighting against tailgating Tailgating causes most rear-end crashes in South Australia.transport.sa.gov.au - Tailgating campaign Some motorways in the United Kingdom and Australia feature certain road markings which can help resolve this problem. Consisting of an arrangement of chevrons, these remind the driver not to tailgate, and assist in the two second rule.au.news.yahoo.com There is also signage in Britain on smart motorways when they are very congested, to say \\"stay in lane : congestion\\". This is to remind motorists that there is, in these conditions, no longer an overtaking lane, merely a number of lanes, some moving faster than others at different points in time (undertaking by inner lanes being entirely permissible in this circumstance). Those in the outermost lanes should, as usual, maintain a two second gap to the vehicle in front; as long as they do this, it is officially discouraged to change lanes. Public goods vehicle licence training in Britain states that lorries should increase the 2 second gap to the vehicle in front to 3 seconds when being tailgated, to ensure that emergency braking can be a little gentler, to compensate for the tailgating vehicle behind having eaten up its own reaction time to almost nothing. In Germany, tailgating is punishable with a fine of up to ‚Ç¨400. In case of gross negligence, one or more penalty points are given and the driver's license may additionally be immediately suspended for up to 3 months.

The term plate glass university or plateglass university refers to a group of universities in the United Kingdom established or promoted to university status in the 1960s. The original plate glass universities were established following decisions by the University Grants Committee (UGC) in the late 1950s and early 1960s, prior to the Robbins Report in 1963. However, the term has since expanded to encompass the institutions that became universities as a result of Robbins' recommendations. Origin of terminology The term plateglass was coined by Michael Beloff for a book he wrote about these universities, to reflect their modern architectural design which often contains wide expanses of plate glass in steel or concrete frames. This contrasted with the (largely Victorian) red brick universities and the very much older ancient universities. Beloff applied the term specifically to the new creations of the 1960s, not including the institutions promoted from university colleges or colleges of advanced technology, or created by division of existing universities \\"as Durham shed Newcastle\\". All of the original plateglass universities were created de novo as universities.  Beloff's plateglass universities  Beloff listed seven universities in his book. These were the seven universities approved by the UGC prior to the Robbins Report. The University of Sussex, the first of the plateglass generation *University of East Anglia (1963) *University of Essex (1964/5) *University of Kent (1965) *University of Lancaster (now known as Lancaster University) (1964) *University of Sussex (1961) *University of Warwick (1965) *University of York (1963) =Naming= Unlike previous universities in the United Kingdom which were usually named after the city they were located in (for example the University of Cambridge in Cambridge), the new universities instead were typically named after the county or wider area they served. The universities founded in Colchester, Canterbury and Brighton were named after the counties they are located in (Essex, Kent and Sussex respectively) and the university in Coventry, Warwickshire was named after the county town of Warwick. The university in Norwich, which is in the county of Norfolk, was instead named for the wider area of East Anglia which also includes Suffolk and Essex. The universities built in Lancaster and York were located in the county towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire respectively, furthermore unlike the other areas there were already several established universities within those counties (Manchester and Liverpool in Lancashire; Leeds, Sheffield and Hull in Yorkshire). Since the passage of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 several new universities have been created within the same city as a plate-glass university and have been named after the city: Brighton, Canterbury Christ Church, Coventry, Norwich University of the Arts and York St John. =Common references= Certain aspects of the design of these universities acknowledges the formation of the group; for example, at Sussex the first batches of student residences to be built were named after some of the other new universities, i.e. \\"Essex House\\", \\"Kent House\\", \\"Lancaster House\\", \\"Norwich House\\" (for UEA), and \\"York House\\". Other universities sometimes referred to as plate glass universities Research at the Department for Education in 2016 categorised universities into four age groups: ancient (pre-1800), red brick (1800‚Äì1960), plate glass (1960-1992), and post-1992.

Excavation of the principal building at R√≠o Bec A, a building with three towers and several rooms, is now underway.  The Rio Bec architectural style  R√≠o Bec temple pyramids are located in the central Maya lowlands. The temple-pyramids are characterized by a unique architectural style that began to appear during the seventh century A.D. and continued into the early twelfth century A.D. The temple-pyramids consist of a range-type building with typically two nonfunctional solid masonry towers on both ends of the range- type building . The twin-towers narrow with ascension in order to give an illusion of greater height. The twin-towers appear to have stairs along their faces leading to the temple that rests atop them. However, the steps are only a design motif that creates the illusion of functional stairs. Even if the steps were functional, the towers rise at steep vertical angles that would make ascending them difficult. The temples, which are located on the platform at the top of the R√≠o Bec towers are inoperative as well. The temples are solid masses with no interior rooms. Pseudo-doorways, which have been built into niches in the fronts of the temples, give the appearance of a functional door . Despite their nonfunctional components, the R√≠o Bec towers hold the typical decorations of a pyramid and its upper temple and at first glance are taken as functional pyramids. The purpose of the R√≠o Bec temple-pyramids is unknown, but they do resemble the twin-tower complexes of Tikal.

It is the prime river of outer, south-east Greater London, rising in Priory Gardens, Orpington, where rainwater percolates through the chalk bedrock of the Downs to form a pond where the eroded ground elevation gives way to impermeable clay. Initially it flows true to form northwards, past industrial and residential St Mary Cray, through St Paul's Cray (where it once powered a paper mill) and through Foots Cray, where it enters the parkland Foots Cray Meadows, flowing under by Five Arches bridge (built in 1781 as part of their designs by Capability Brown). It then flows by restored Loring Hall (c.1760), home of the Lord Castlereagh who took his own life there in 1822. It continues through North Cray and Bexley. It neighbours a restored Gothic (architecture) cold plunge bath house, built around 1766 as part of Vale Mascal Estate. It is then joined by the River Shuttle (a small brook) and then continues through the parkland of Hall Place, which was built for John Champneys in 1540. The Cray turns eastward through Crayford and Barnes Cray to join the Darent in Dartford Creek. The Creek is a well-watered partly tidal inlet (of the Tideway) between Crayford Marshes and Dartford Marshes by a slight projection of land, Crayford Ness.

From source to mouth they were: =Orpington Mill= A Domesday site, Orpington Mill stood almost at the source of the River Cray. The mill building dated from the 18th century and was of traditional construction, with a timber frame clad with weatherboards under a peg tile roof. The mill was powered by a by cast iron waterwheel carried on a cast iron axle which had replaced an earlier wooden one. Much of the machinery was of cast iron, including the wallower, great spur wheel and crown wheel. The upright shaft was of wood. The mill drove three pairs of millstones. Miller John Colgate had introduced steam power by the 1870s, and the tall chimney for the steam engine was known locally as \\"Colgate's Folly\\", as it did not function as well as intended. The mill was used as a store in its final years before its demolition in 1934 or 1935. =Snelling's Mill, St Mary Cray= A weir near the Temple URC Church marked the site of a Domesday mill. The mill was demolished in 1872 and the area landscaped as part of the grounds of a public park. William Joynson bought the mill for ¬£8,000 to enable the creation of the park.Rootsweb St Mary Cray‚Äìby John Blundell section The by cast iron waterwheel survived. It was used to drive a beam pump which supplied water to fountains and conservatories at \\"The Rookery\\". The wheel was intact until 1962, when the shed it was in was stripped of ivy and exposed. The wheel was then vandalised and had been cleared away by March 1964. =Upper Paper Mill, St Mary Cray= This mill stood opposite the Black Boy public house; it had an undershot waterwheel. Nicholas Townsend was mentioned in insurance records in 1757, and William Sims in 1771.Rootsweb St. Mary Cray Paper Mills section In 1784 William Townsend was first mentioned as a paper maker in St Mary Cray. In 1786 Samuel Lay of Sittingbourne was the paper maker; he was described as a master papermaker in 1801. Martha Lay ordered two moulds in 1806. Martha Lay was running the mill in 1816;Rootsweb The History of St Mary Cray section paper from this mill bore the watermark Martha Lay 1804.Mills archive BAPH The mill ceased working in 1834. =Joynson's Mill, St Mary Cray= This was a corn mill which stood near St Mary Cray church. It was replaced by a paper mill, then a paper factory and in recent years by a warehouse complex. In 1787 this mill was being run by Henry Brightly. John Hall was the owner in 1816. Charles Cowan was working at the mill in 1819, when the mill had two vats and was producing an estimated of paper a week. William Joynson took over in 1834.Ideal Homes He had previously been at a paper mill in Snodland.Snodland history Paper produced here bore the watermarks \\"Joynson Superfine\\" or \\"WJ&S;\\" over \\"St Mary Cray Kent\\".Rootsweb In 1839, Joynson was granted a patent for watermarking paper produced by machine. The waterwheel was of cast iron construction and may have been overshot, as the head was some to . The mill was expanded in 1853, when a second machine was installed, enabling the steam driven mills to produce 25 to 30 tons of paper a week. William Joynson died in 1874 and the mills were left in trust to his two grandsons. One of them, William, drowned in 1875 leaving Edmund Hamborough Joynson as sole heir. Cowan mentions that the mill was producing an estimated of paper a week in 1878. Some 700 people were employed at the mill in 1881 and E. H. Joynson took over the mill in September 1882, expanding it the following year with a new steam engine and machinery. An engraving of the mill in 1891 can be seen here. Joynson produced only high quality writing papers. In the late 1890s, a dryer was sold to Nash's and installed in their mill at St Pauls Cray. Edmund Joynson took his son into partnership shortly before World War One. The firm became William Joynson & Son. In 1914, Joynson's paper was used in the first ¬£1 and 10/- banknotes issued by the Bank of England. Edmund H Joynson retired in 1930 and the mills were taken over by Messrs Wiggins Teape & Co. who promptly closed the mills in order to rebuild them. 350 people were made redundant, and only 200 were employed in the reopened factory. The paper factory made greaseproof and vegetable parchment paper.Rootsweb Bombshell at St. Mary Cray, Joynson's mill closed. \\"Village out of work.\\" section The mill reopened in April 1933 as the Vegetable Parchment Mills (Delcroix) Ltd. The production of \\"vulcanised fibre\\" began around 1943. In 1963 the mill was the home of the National Paper Museum The mill closed in 1967 and the paper museum collection was transferred to the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester.Rootsweb Joynson's Mill section =St Paul's Cray Mill= In 1718 this mill had two waterwheels driving machinery for dressing leather in oil, and a third for corn milling. The mill was replaced by a paper mill, powered by a turbine. =Foots Cray (Nash's) Paper Mill= This paper mill replaced the earlier corn mill. Papermaking had been established by 1742. A steam engine had been installed by around 1820. It was used in the 1830s as a meeting place for Baptists.Foots Cray Baptist Church In 1845, Mary Ann Nash inherited the profits and rents of the mill until her sons came of age under the terms of her husband's will. Mary Ann Nash died on 7 June 1852. Thomas Nash enlarged the mill in 1853. After his death at the age of 21, his brother William was manager under the trustees until he came of age in 1857. William Nash was married twice, and had five children. In 1870 they moved from the Mill House to a new house called Crayfield House. It is recorded that the axle of the waterwheel protruded into the kitchen of the Mill House. William Nash died on 11 September 1879 and the mill was in the hands of trustees again. In 1898 a 250 horsepower (about 190 kW) double- expansion condensing steam engine by Pollitt & Wigzell was installed, along with a second paper machine. Shortly after this a secondhand dryer was purchased from Joynson's mill to replace one that had proved unsuitable.Rootsweb Paper Makers 1817-1967 section By 1954 the site was a factory complex. It had been demolished by 1986. =Foot's Cray Mill= Foot's Cray mill was a paper mill. By the 1870s it was used as a fabric printing works. In 1900 the mill was being used as a factory making photographic film. Its final function was the processing of silk. The paper mill had two cast iron overshot waterwheels in parallel. Each was diameter. One was wide and the other was wide. The mill was demolished in 1929. =Old Mill, Bexley= The Old Mill PHA Domesday site, one of three in Bexley. This was a corn mill. In 1255, the miller, Auxellus, was censured for allowing the escape of a suspected murderer. A millstone was bought for 55s.6d. in 1300.Ideal Homes The last building on the site dated from 1779, when the low breast shot waterwheel of by powered four pairs of millstones. It was owned by the Cannon family from 1839 to 1907. Stephen Cannon was the first of the Cannon family, also running mills on the River Darent. The miller in 1872 was Stephen Cannon (son), who concentrated the business at Bexley, the mills on the Darent being sold. A steam engine was installed in 1884, the tall chimney was built by a Mr Hart from Lancashire, who fell from the top whilst doing repairs and lived to tell the tale as his fall was broken by the roof of the engine house. The Cannon family sold Bexley mill in 1907. The mill was used in its latter days for making sacks.Ideal Homes A picture of the mill can be seen here. The mill was burnt down on 12 May 1966 and was replaced by the Old Mill PH, a pub with a mill theme. In 2007, the pub/restaurant was converted into residential accommodation in the form of flats. Archaeological work carried out by Wessex Archaeology that took place prior to the redevelopment found that \\"Aside from the levelling deposits no archaeological deposits or remains were observed\\" and that \\"No traces of the medieval / post-medieval mill or of the wing shown on the 1873 Ordnance Survey maps of the area were observed\\" either. =Hall Place Mill, Bexley= A Domesday site, this mill stood behind the mansion of Hall Place. The mill was run by the Cannon family at one time. It was a corn mill until 1882, and was then converted to a silk printing and flagmaking factory. It was demolished by a traction engine in 1925, with some of the main beams being sold to an American millionaire, Mr Brady. He used them in the construction of a mansion. The low breast shot waterwheel was by and powered at least two pairs of millstones. =Swaisland's Printing Works, Crayford= A print works was established by Charles Swaisland in 1812. Two waterwheel symbols were marked on Greenwood's 1821 map. A cast iron and wood low breast shot waterwheel of about by was removed around 1948. It drove wooden drums for fabric washing. A second waterwheel was in existence in 1893. =Calico Mill= This mill stood where Watling Street crossed the Cray. In the 18th century it processed calico. It was marked on Greenwood's 1821 map as Calico Mills. =Lower (Iron) Mill, Crayford= This was the site of a plating mill built in the 16th century. It was in existence by 1570. It was still used as a flatting mill in the early 18th century, when it was owned by Lady Shovell. It was known as Crayford Iron Mill in 1800.Cray Walk It had a breastshot waterwheel. In 1817, it was replaced by Crayford Flour Mills. =Crayford Saw Mill= This was a saw mill powered by a breast shot waterwheel. It partnered Crayford Iron Mill from 1765. The timber for the floor of Buckingham Palace was produced here. The saw mill stood alongside Crayford flour Mill; it was standing in 1854. =Crayford Flour Mills= Crayford Flour Mills were built in 1817. They were powered by a cast iron low breast shot waterwheel by and drove five pairs of French Burr millstones. The upright shaft was wooden, with a cast iron wallower. The waterwheel and machinery were scrapped in 1914, when roller milling plant was installed, driven by gas engines.

His work, along with that of Clifford Geertz and others, is often referred to as symbolic and interpretive anthropology. Early life Victor Turner was born in Glasgow, Scotland, son to Norman and Violet Turner. His father was an electrical engineer and his mother a repertory actress, who founded the Scottish National Players. Turner initially studied poetry and classics at the University College London. In 1941, Turner was drafted into World War II, and served as a noncombatant until 1944. During his three years of service he met and married Edith Brocklesby Davis, who was serving during the war as a \\"land girl\\". Their five children include scientist Robert Turner, poet Frederick Turner, and Rory Turner, an anthropology professor at Goucher College. Turner returned to University College in 1946 with a new focus on anthropology. He later pursued graduate studies in anthropology at Manchester University. Career Turner worked in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) as research officer for the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute. It was through the position that Turner started his lifelong study of the Ndembu people of Zambia. He completed his PhD at University of Manchester in 1955. Like many of the Manchester anthropologists of his time, he also became concerned with conflict. He developed the new concept of social drama in order to account for the symbolism of conflict and crisis resolution among Ndembu villagers. Turner spent his career exploring rituals. As a professor at the University of Chicago in the late 1950s, Turner began to apply his study of rituals and rites of passage to world religions and the lives of religious heroes. He and his wife converted to Catholicism in 1958. Turner explored Arnold van Gennep's threefold structure of rites of passage and expanding theories on the liminal phase. Van Gennep's structure consisted of a pre-liminal phase (separation), a liminal phase (transition), and a post-liminal phase (reincorporation). Turner noted that in liminality, the transitional state between two phases, individuals were \\"betwixt and between\\": they did not belong to the society that they previously were a part of and they were not yet reincorporated into that society. Liminality is a limbo, an ambiguous period characterized by humility, seclusion, tests, sexual ambiguity, and communitas. Turner was also a committed ethnographer and produced work on ritual. He and his wife Edith L. B. Turner co-authored Image and Pilgrimage in Christian Culture (1978). Death Turner died on 18 December 1983 in Charlottesville, Virginia. After his death, his widow Edith Turner embarked on her own career as an anthropologist. She developed upon Victor's \\"anthropology of experience\\" with a publication on communitas. Influence Author Chuck Palahniuk was quoted in The Believer as saying, \\"So often what I‚Äôm doing is dramatizing the writings of Victor Turner, who wrote a lot about liminal and liminoid events.\\"http://www.believermag.com/issues/201405/?read=interview_palahniuk_spanbauer Turner's work on liminality and performance has strongly influenced developments in the field of Performance Studies, particularly due to his friendship and professional collaboration with Richard Schechner with whom he explored the relationship between ritual and theater. Victor Turner Prize The Victor Turner Prize in Ethnographic Writing is awarded annually by The Society for Humanistic Anthropology (SHA). Eligible works are \\"published books in various genres including ethnographic monographs, narratives, essays, biographies, memoirs, poetry, and drama.\\" Kirin Narayan's Storytellers, Saints and Scoundrels: Folk Narrative in Hindu Religious Teaching (1989) was the first Victor Turner Prize winner in 1990.

Route description Starting in Sumter, South Carolina, US 401 goes northeast through mostly swamp and farmland, as it connects the cities of Darlington and Bennettsville before crossing the state line into North Carolina. Traversing the state for , it is mostly a two-lane rural road, which is likely to only have local traffic along it due to nearby Interstate 95. In North Carolina, the highway becomes more utilized, as it connects several mid-size and large cities in the state. In the sandhills region, it connects the cities of Laurinburg, Raeford, and Fayetteville, all three of which have business routes connecting the downtown areas. The road is typically two-lane still, but expands to four-lane (or more) in each city. The road then runs somewhat parallel to nearby Interstate 95 from Fayetteville through Lillington to Fuquay-Varina. In Wake County, US 401 is center-stage again as a major north-south corridor, connecting bedroom communities to downtown Raleigh. Once it leaves the county, it reverts to a rural road connecting the small cities of Louisburg and Warrenton. US 401 finally ends at Interstate 85, just north of the community of Wise; completing a through the state. Overall, the route goes through endless fields of farmland broken now and then by cities and small towns. With exceptions to both the sandhills region and Wake County, most travelers would be better served using Interstate 95. History The north end of US 401 at I-85 US 401 was established in 1957 as a renumbering of US 15A, from Sumter to Raleigh, and NC 59, from Raleigh to Norlina; it is the third and current route to bear the name. In 1967, northbound US 401 was rerouted along South Street west onto McDowell Street, formally using Lenoir Street, in Raleigh. That same year, US 401 was rerouted onto a bypass route northwest of downtown Fayetteville, replacing part of NC 59; its old alignment became US 401 Business. In 1971, US 52/US 401 was placed on a new bypass northwest of Darlington; its old alignment became US 52 Business. In 1984, US 401 was rerouted along the eastern half of the Raleigh Beltline (Tom Bradshaw Freeway and Cliff Benson Beltway); its former alignment through downtown Raleigh was downgraded to secondary roads. In 1991, US 401 was rerouted back through downtown Raleigh after I-440 was established along the entire Raleigh Beltline. In 2001, US 401 was extended north, in concurrency with US 1, to its current northern terminus to I-85, north of Norlina. On July 16, 2015, US 401 was placed onto new four- lane superstreet alignment bypassing east of Rolesville; its former alignment through downtown Rolesville became US 401 Business. The first US 401 existed between 1926-1931, solely in Virginia, it was replaced by US 52\\\\. The second US 401 existed between 1932-1934, in North Carolina and South Carolina, it was replaced by US 15 and US 15A. Future Considered an important link between Fayetteville, Lillington and Raleigh, NCDOT has set up the US 401 Corridor Study. The purpose of the study is to identify deficiencies in the existing corridor and develop alternatives for accommodating future growth in traffic volumes (i.e. widen to multi-lanes). The corridor study also includes NC 55 and NC 210. Estimated costs for all road improvements along the corridor is around $193‚Äì222.6 million.

The title was established in 2001 and existed for eight years until it was unified with the IPW:UK Championship in September 2009. The IPW:UK Championship and the All-England Championship were de-unified in 2012. The titles were unified in 2018 thus the IPW:UK World Championship was created as a result. The All- England Championship title reigns were determined by professional wrestling matches. History =FWA= The genesis of the All-England title had its roots in the weekly FWA TV show on Portsmouth's MyTV channel in the summer of 2001. With the main FWA title held by Doug Williams, and Williams in a storyline dispute with the promotion's commissioner, Victoria De Montfort, a decision was made to focus on a secondary belt as a TV championship. At the time, the FWA had been using the FWA European Union Championship as a secondary title, and with the company's ownership keen on promoting a particularly English flavour to the show, the title was renamed the All- England championship, a nod to the organisation running the Wimbledon tennis championships. Scottie Rock, the last-recognised EU Champion, had been coming to the ring wearing the belt, which at that point was not recognised on the TV show. This was explained away as being a \\"gypsy fighting championship\\" belt by the commentary team. Nevertheless, Rock and Johnny Storm were chosen to compete for the initial championship, won by Storm in Portsmouth in July 2001. The championship was initially envisaged as being a Brits-only competition. However, Ahmed Chaer, a Turkish-German wrestler from the German Stampede Wrestling promotion, was given the title to cement a short-lived alliance between the two promotions, though he lost it on his first defence a week later, to Paul Travell. Although the belt would then revert to its homegrown roots, the American Chris Hamrick would also later hold the title. = IPW:UK = Former champion Leroy Kincade, who defeated Hade Vansen on October 16, 2005, was stripped of the title on November 19, 2006 after siding with International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom in an inter-promotional feud with FWA. Kincade first put his title reign in jeopardy on October 7 of that year by competing in an unsanctioned All-England Title defence at an IPW:UK show. Even though FWA had a working relationship with the promotion, and Kincade in fact retained the title, FWA refused to recognise the result of the match as the FWA management team did not agree for IPW:UK to use the All-England Title name and belt on their show. This continued with Kincade repeatedly siding with IPW:UK and scheduling his own title defences before finally being stripped of the FWA All-England Championship. Kincade continued to defend the belt even though not officially being champion. However the next official champion would be FWA loyalist Iceman who defeated Kincade at an IPW show. Prior to the match, the FWA announced it would sanction the Title match only if Iceman won. During the Final Frontiers show, IPW:UK wrestler Sam Slam won the title from Iceman. However, this show also saw IPW:UK win the inter- promotional feud and put FWA out of business, leaving the titles status unclear. FWA would also revive itself as XWA but would sever all ties with the All-England Championship. The title would continue to operate in IPW:UK for just under two years, being part of the British National Championship tournament in 2008, until it was unified into the IPW:UK Championship. On September 15, 2012, Sha Samuels, holder of the IPW:UK Championship, un-unified the IPW:UK World and IPW:UK All-England belts, putting the All-England title back into active duty. On April 29, 2018, Mark Haskins re-unified the All- England belt with the IPW:UK Championship, thus renaming the latter to the Undisputed IPW World Championship.

The river rises at two or more springs between Avery Hill and Eltham in the Royal Borough of Greenwich at the junction of the permeable Blackheath Beds and the denser Woolwich Beds. It flows east through the parkland of Avery Hill, then crosses into the London Borough of Bexley and continues through Parish Wood Park and Hollyoak Wood Park, Willersley Park, Marlborough Park and Sidcup Golf Course, where it feeds a lake in the grounds of Lamorbey Mansion (c. 1750) a house now within the Rose Bruford College campus. Continuing east, it flows through Bexley Woods and then follows the south side of the major A2 London-to-Dover road and through the grounds of Beths Grammar School until it flows into the River Cray just south of Hall Place. A walk called the Shuttle Riverway follows the river for its entire length of five miles (about 8 km). This was created following a persistent campaign by Donald Stringer of Brookdale Road. The walk follows the river where possible but also uses woods, parks, alleyways and some linking roads. A tributary, the Wyncham Stream, flows into the Shuttle in Hollyoak Wood Park. Its route from the Sports Grounds on the A20 to Holly Oak Park, takes it past Dulverton Primary School, under the Dartford to London via Sidcup railway line, the Old Farm Avenue allotments and under Halfway Street.

The area is famous for a carbonate mineral left by the flowing of thermal spring water. It is located in Turkey's Inner Aegean region, in the River Menderes valley, which has a temperate climate for most of the year. The ancient Greco-Roman city of Hierapolis was built on top of the travertine formation which is in total about long, wide and high. It can be seen from the hills on the opposite side of the valley in the town of Denizli, 20 km away. Known as Pamukkale (Cotton Castle) or ancient Hierapolis (Holy City), this area has been drawing visitors to its thermal springs since the time of Classical antiquity. The Turkish name refers to the surface of the shimmering, snow-white limestone, shaped over millennia by calcite-rich springs. Dripping slowly down the mountainside, mineral-rich waters collect in and cascade down the mineral terraces, into pools below. Legend has it that the formations are solidified cotton (the area's principal crop) that giants left out to dry. People have visited area for thousands of years, due to the attraction of the thermal pools. As recently as the mid-20th century, hotels were built over the ruins of Hierapolis, causing considerable damage. An approach road was built from the valley over the terraces, and motor bikes were allowed to go up and down the slopes. When the area was declared a World Heritage Site, the hotels were demolished and the road removed and replaced with artificial pools. There are well-preserved Roman ruins and a museum on site. A small footpath runs up the mountain face for visitors to use, however the travertine terraces are all off-limits, having suffered damage, erosion and water pollution due to tourism. Geology Panoramic view of travertine terraces at Pamukkale Pamukkale's terraces are made of travertine, a sedimentary rock deposited by mineral water from the hot springs. In this area, there are 17 hot springs with temperatures ranging from to . The water that emerges from the spring is transported to the head of the travertine terraces and deposits calcium carbonate on a section long covering an expanse of to . When the water, supersaturated with calcium carbonate, reaches the surface, carbon dioxide de-gasses from it, and calcium carbonate is deposited. Calcium carbonate is deposited by the water as a soft gel which eventually crystallizes into travertine. Archeology Travertine terraces at a hot spring at Pamukkale There are only a few historical facts known about the origin of the city. No traces of the presence of Hittites or Persians have been found. The Phrygians built a temple, probably in the first half of the 7th century BC. This temple, originally used by the citizens of the nearby town of Laodicea, would later form the centre of Hierapolis. Pools inside the archeological site Hierapolis was founded as a thermal spa early in the 2nd century BC within the sphere of the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus the Great sent 2,000 Jewish families to Lydia and Phrygia from Babylon and Mesopotamia, later joined by more from Judea. The Jewish congregation grew in Hierapolis and has been estimated as high as 50,000 in 62 BC.Padfield.com. \\"Jewish Congregation in Hierapolis\\". Hierapolis became a healing centre where doctors used the thermal springs as a treatment for their patients. The city began minting bronze coins in the 2nd century BC. These coins give the name Hieropolis. It remains unclear whether this name referred to the original temple (, hieron) or honoured Hiera, the wife of Telephus, son of Heracles and the Mysian princess Auge, the supposed founder of Pergamon's Attalid dynasty. This name eventually changed into Hierapolis (\\"holy city\\"),. In 133 BC, when Attalus III died, he bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. Hierapolis thus became part of the Roman province of Asia. In AD 17, during the rule of the emperor Tiberius, a major earthquake destroyed the city. Through the influence of the Christian apostle Paul, a church was founded here while he was at Ephesus.. The Christian apostle Philip spent the last years of his life here.Papias. Early Christian Writings . The town's Martyrium was alleged to have been built upon the spot where Philip was crucified in AD 80. His daughters were also said to have acted as prophetesses in the region. During the 4th century, the Christians filled Pluto's Gate (a ploutonion) with stones, suggesting that Christianity had become the dominant religion and begun displacing other faiths in the area. Originally a see of Phrygia Pacatiana,RAMSAY, Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia (Oxford, 1895‚Äì1897) the Byzantine emperor Justinian raised the bishop of Hierapolis to the rank of metropolitan in 531. The Roman baths were transformed to a Christian basilica. During the Byzantine period, the city continued to flourish and also remained an important centre for Christianity. =Museum= The museum contains historical artifacts from Hierapolis, as well as those from Laodiceia, Colossae, Tripolis, Attuda and other towns of the Lycos (√á√ºr√ºksu) valley. The museum also has a section devoted to artifacts found at Beycesultan H√ºy√ºk that includes examples of Bronze Age craft. Artifacts from the Caria, Pisidia and Lydia regions are also on display. The museum's exhibition space consists of three closed areas of the Hierapolis Bath and the open areas in the eastern side which are known to have been used as the library and gymnasium. The artifacts in open exhibition space are mostly marble and stone. Hierapolis is broken down into ruins. World heritage site Pamukkale is recognized as a World Heritage Site together with Hierapolis. Hierapolis-Pamukkale was made a World Heritage Site in 1988. It is a tourist attraction due to this status and it's natural beauty. The underground volcanic activity which causes the hot springs also forced carbon dioxide into a cave, which was called the Plutonium, which here means \\"place of the god Pluto\\". This cave was used for religious purposes by priests of Cybele, who found ways to appear immune to the suffocating gas.  Protecting the thermal waters  The hotels built in the 1960s were demolished as they were draining the thermal waters into their swimming pools and caused damage to the terraces. The water supply to the hotels is restricted in an effort to preserve the overall site and to allow deposits to regenerate. Access to the terraces is not allowed and visitors are asked to follow the pathway.Pamukkale Travetines Denizli Sister cities The city of Pamukkale has two sister cities: * Eger, Hungary * Las Vegas, United States Similar places These locations are also well known for their travertine formations: *Egerszal√≥k in Hungary *Badab-e Surt in Iran *Mammoth Hot Springs in the USA *Pink and White Terraces in New Zealand *Hierve el Agua in Mexico *Bagni San Filippo (Siena) *Baishuitai in China *Tatev, Armenia *Terme di Saturnia in Italy *Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area, A similar UNESCO world heritage travertine cascade in China.

US 211 connects the Shenandoah Valley with the Piedmont town of Warrenton via Luray and Sperryville, where the highway runs concurrently with US 340 and US 522, respectively. Route description View east along US 211 in Shenandoah County US 211 begins at a diamond interchange with I-81 just west of the town of New Market. Old Cross Road continues west as SR 211, a state-numbered extension of the U.S. Highway that runs west to Timberville. US 211 heads into the town as a four-lane divided highway that reduces to two lanes prior to turning north onto US 11 (Congress Street). The highway runs concurrently with US 11 north to two-lane Lee Highway, onto which US 211 turns east. The U.S. Highway expands to a four-lane divided highway after leaving the town of New Market. US 211 becomes a three-lane road, with two lanes in the ascending direction and one on the descending side, for its curvaceous path over Massanutten Mountain, which summits at New Market Gap at the Shenandoah-Page county line. US 211 expands to a four-lane divided highway again just west of its junction with US 340 at the hamlet of Intersections. The two highways pass through the hamlets of Salem, Whitehouse Landing--where the highways cross the South Fork Shenandoah River--and pass Luray Caverns at the west end of the town of Luray. US 211 Business (Main Street) passes through the center of town while US 211 and US 340 bypass the town to the north. US 340 splits north at a diamond interchange with Broad Street, which heads south into town as US 340 Business. US 211 crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Hagerstown District just west of its intersection with the east end of US 211 Business (Main Street). US 211 reduces to three lanes (two ascending, one descending) for its crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains within Shenandoah National Park. The U.S. Highway reaches its summit at Thornton Gap, where the highway has an interchange with Skyline Drive and enters Rappahannock County. US 211 follows the Thornton River as a two-lane road east to Sperryville, where the highway becomes concurrent with US 522 (Sperryville Pike). The U.S. Highways follow a four-lane divided highway past Rediviva to the Rappahannock County seat of Washington. US 211 Business heads north onto town as Main Street and rejoins US 211 and US 522 as Warren Street adjacent to the historic Calvert Mill/Washington Mill. Just east of Rose Hill, US 522 splits north as Zachary Taylor Highway. US 211 passes through Amissville and briefly through Culpeper County, where the highway meets the northern end of SR 229 (Rixeyville Road). US 211 crosses the Rappahannock River at Waterloo and enters Fauquier County. The highway enters the town of Warrenton as Frost Street south of Fauquier High School. At its intersection with US 17 Business and US 29 Business (Broadview Avenue), US 211 Business continues straight toward downtown Warrenton as Waterloo Street while the mainline U.S. Highway turns north concurrent with the business routes, which pass through a commercial area. The highway curves east at its northern junction with US 17 Business (Broadview Avenue) and continues as Lee Highway. US 211 reaches its eastern terminus at Blackwell Road, which heads south as US 15 Business and north as SR 672.

Route history =Precursor: Virginia State Route 21= Virginia State Route 21 was an original state route defined by the Virginia General Assembly as part of a state highway system in January 1918. Running from Warrenton through Manassas and Fairfax to the Highway Bridge over the Potomac River at Washington, D.C. In 1921, VA 21 was rerouted around Manassas and also rerouted at Fairfax eastward through Falls Church along Lee Highway to a terminus at the Aqueduct Bridge (replaced by the nearby Key Bridge in 1923). This new route was roughly that of present-day US 29 from Warrenton to Washington, D.C. Also in December 1921, VA 21 was extended westward from Warrenton to what was then VA 7 at Massies Corner. It was then continued concurrently with VA 7 to Washington, Virginia. The following year, VA 21 was extended yet further west, first to Sperryville concurrent with VA 7, and then west through Luray to a terminus at VA 3 (now US 11) New Market, replacing VA 16\\\\. In 1926 following the creation of U.S. Numbered Highway System, US 211 and US 50 designations were added to VA 21 (US 211 from New Market to Fairfax and US 50 from Fairfax to Washington, D.C.). In July 1933, VA 21 was removed from the state highway system as part of a commonwealth-wide renumbering scheme. =US 211= US 211 was an original US Highway, debuting in late 1926. It ran concurrently with the portion of what was then Virginia State Route 21 from New Market to Fairfax. In 1928, US 211 was extended eastward to Washington, D.C., along the remainder of VA 21, replacing what had been US 50\\\\. (US 50 was relocated to the south along the route of what is now VA 236 from Fairfax to Alexandria.) In 1934, US 29 was added to the route of US 211 from Warrenton to Washington, D.C. In July 1980, the US 29/211 concurrency was eliminated. The eastern terminus of US 211 was truncated from Washington, D.C., to its current end in Warrenton, leaving US 29 on that route.

In 1933, US 311 was extended south through Pinehurst, Aberdeen, and Laurinburg, to Rowland, overlapping NC 241\\\\. A year later, US 220 was established and replaced US 311 south of Asheboro and north of Madison, severing the connection with its parent route. Sections further south were replaced by NC 2 (today's NC 211) and US 501\\\\. Later in 1966, US 311 was truncated in Randleman; by 1973, US 311 southern terminus was moved to US 220 Bypass, in Randleman. By 1952, US 311 was rerouted west of downtown Winston- Salem, following Waughtown Road, Stadium Drive, Claremont Avenue and 7th Street, to New Walkertown Road. In the mid-1980s, US 311 was moved onto new freeway through southeast Forsyth County. In 1996, the route through Winston- Salem changed again, going west on Interstate 40 then north along US 52/NC 8 to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive then east onto New Walkertown Road. In 1997, the first section of the East Belt was opened in High Point, rerouting US 311 onto the new freeway to Eastchester Drive then back into downtown High Point with concurrency with North Carolina Highway 68. The old alignment along North Main Street became US 311 Business. On November 20, 2004, the second section of the \\"East Belt\\" was opened, rerouting US 311 to I-85 Bus./US 29/US 70\\\\. On November 22, 2010, the third and final section of the \\"East Belt\\" was completed, linking Interstate 85; Also Interstate 74 was established as an concurrency of US 311 from Cedar Square Road to North Main Street. In September 2003, US 311 was extended north from Madison to NC 14/NC 87/NC 770 in Eden, via US 220 and NC 135\\\\. The extension was finally signed in August 2011. The route was approved by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in November 2012, after an initial request by officials in Eden, to be extended to US 58 in Virginia; which in January 2013, NCDOT signed off on extending the route and replacing parts of NC 700 and NC 770. US 311 was signed in the field in Virginia, from Danville south to the state line (replacing secondary State Route 863) in September 2013. Since 2003, a project called the \\"US 311 Connector\\" has been planned by NCDOT and the city of Winston-Salem. Estimated at $23.5 million (2003 dollars), the four-lane urban boulevard would connect between I-40 (exit 196) and I-40 Business (exit 8), linking US 311 with US 158 (Reidsville Road); it also included a landscaped medium with walking/bicycle trails parallel to it. By 2016, the project has ceased appearing in the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), though still part of the Winston-Salem 2035 Transportation Plan. In May 2018, AASHTO approved a request by NCDOT to eliminate between Randleman and Winston-Salem, moving the southern terminus from I-73 in Randleman to Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard in Winston-Salem, as all but of this section is freeway which already has other primary designations; those non-redundant sections would be reassigned secondary North Carolina routes. In January 2019, NCDOT officially eliminated the section. Junction list Special routes =High Point business loop= Established in 1997, when mainline US 311 was placed on new freeway east of High Point, it was long following North Main Street from US 311 to Eastchester Drive. On December 2005, US 311 Business was extended south, through the downtown area, to I-85 Bus./US 29/US 70\\\\. However, on November 23, 2009, US 311 Business was decommissioned, a couple of years before the completion of the \\"East Belt.\\" References External links * * Endpoints of U.S. Highway 311 11-3 11-3 11-3 Category:Transportation in Winston-Salem, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Randolph County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Guilford County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Forsyth County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Stokes County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Rockingham County, North Carolina U.S. Route 311 3 ","title":"U.S. Route 311"},{"id":"902446","text":"Guidimaka () is the southernmost region of Mauritania.

US 411 extends for about from US 78 in Leeds, Alabama, to US 25W/US 70 in Newport, Tennessee. US 411 travels through northeastern Alabama, northwestern Georgia, and southeastern Tennessee. Notable towns and cities along its route include Gadsden, Alabama; Rome, Georgia; Cartersville, Georgia; Maryville, Tennessee; Sevierville, Tennessee, and Newport, Tennessee. US 411 and US 11 never intersect with one another, though they come very close in Leeds, Alabama, Gadsden, Alabama, and Maryville, Tennessee. US 411 also spends much of its route close to the Interstate Highway System: Interstate 20 (I-20), I-40, I-75, and I-59, though it never has an interchange with I-59. Route description Most of the terrain through which US 411 passes is rural countryside, with no major metropolitan areas directly along its route. However, it does pass relatively near the major cities of Birmingham, Alabama, Chattanooga, Tennessee and Knoxville, Tennessee. In Sevier County, Tennessee, south of Knoxville, US 411 is used by many tourists as a route to the northern side of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. US 411 passes approximately north of the national park, but intersects with US 441, which actually goes through this park. Although US 411 has a south‚Äìnorth designation, it contains long stretches that are west‚Äìeast, and its overall direction is actually southwest‚Äìnortheast. US 411 is generally a two-lane highway through the countryside. However, it has long been a four-lane, divided highway connecting Rome and Cartersville, Georgia, and it is a multi-lane highway connecting Cartersville with I-75. Also, for part of its route in the Cartersville area, US 411 shares a four-lane, divided highway with US 41\\\\. Furthermore, the Tennessee Department of Transportation completed a project to widen the highway to four lanes between Maryville and Ocoee, Tennessee. The following portions of US 411 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: *From the southern part of Rainbow City, Alabama, through Gadsden, to a point southwest of Turkey Town *From the southern end of the US 27/SR 1 concurrency in Six Mile, Georgia, through Rome and Cartersville, to McCallie *The entire length of the US 76 concurrency, from south-southeast of Chatsworth, into the city *From the Georgia‚ÄìTennessee state line, in Tennga, to the bridge over the Little River, northeast of Maryville, Tennessee =Alabama= US 411 begins at US 78 (Parkway Drive) in the city of Leeds in far eastern Jefferson County. SR 25, the U.S. Highway's companion route, continues south as a signed highway that briefly follows US 78 east before splitting south toward Harpersville; however, mileposts along US 411 in Alabama generally reflect SR 25. US 411 heads north along two-lane 9th Street, which has a pair of at-grade crossings of Norfolk Southern Railway rail lines. The street's name changes to Whitmire Street, which the U.S. Highway follows to Ashville Road. US 411 follows Ashville Road, a two-lane road with center turn lane, northeast into St. Clair County, where the highway expands to four lanes. The U.S. Highway meets I-20 at a partial cloverleaf interchange as it leaves the city of Leeds. US 411 continues as two-lane Moody Parkway northeast through the Cahaba Valley formed by the Little Cahaba River between Pine Ridge to the west and Oak Ridge to the east. The highway has a brief concurrency with SR 174 through Odenville, where the highways pass under a CSX rail line. US 411 continues northeast through the Beaver Creek Valley between Pine Ridge and the Beaver Creek Mountains. The highway leaves the valley after it joins US 231 (Heart of Dixie Highway) to pass through Pine Ridge to the city of Ashville. The U.S. Highways enter town along 5th Street and proceed to the county courthouse, where they meet the eastern end of SR 23 (6th Avenue). Both highways turn east onto 6th Avenue, then US-231 turns north onto Court Street East. US 411 leaves Ashville along Rainbow Drive, which heads northeast between Big Canoe Creek and Canoe Creek Mountain to the south. The U.S. Highway crosses the mountain and enters Etowah County where it crosses the Big Canoe Creek branch of Neely Henry Lake. US 411 follows the western flank of Dunaway mountain to Rainbow City, where the route intersects SR 77 (Grand Avenue). Spirit of American Citizenship Monument on the Coosa River in Gadsden, Alabama US 411 expands to a four-lane divided highway as it enters the city of Gadsden. The highway crosses the Big Wills Creek branch of Neely Henry Lake and meets the eastern end of I-759 at a partial cloverleaf interchange; that freeway continues east as SR 759. US 411 veers onto Albert Rains Boulevard, which follows the right bank of the Coosa River through downtown Gadsden. The highway passes by the Spirit of American Citizenship Monument and under Broad Street, a CSX rail line, and US 278 and US 431 (Meighan Boulevard), which access US 411 via a partial cloverleaf interchange. US 411 leaves (or will soon exit) Gadsden along a newly constructed four-lane divided highway that passes between Shinbone Ridge to the west and several loops of the Coosa River. The U.S. Highway drops to two lanes before it enters Cherokee County, then expands again to a four-lane divided highway, Weiss Lake Boulevard. US 411 curves east along the northern edge of Weiss Lake and intersects SR 68 (Industrial Boulevard) in the town of Leesburg, east of which US 411 and SR 68 cross the lake, an impoundment of the Coosa River. Shortly after entering the city of Centre, the U.S. Highway and state highway turn onto the Clarence E. Chestnut Jr. Bypass, a four-lane road with center turn lane; US 411 Business and SR 25 continue along Main Street into the center of town. SR 68 diverges from the U.S. Highway at Cedar Bluff Road, which carries SR 283 southwest toward downtown. SR 283 becomes US 411's companion route on the bypass, which next intersects SR 9 (Armory Road), which intersects SR 68 immediately to the north. US 411 drops to two lanes east of SR 9 and curves south to collect the east end of US 411 Business (Main Street) and SR 25 on the eastern edge of Centre. US 411 continues east and crosses Cowan Creek before reaching the Alabama-Georgia state line and the northern terminus of SR 25 east of the hamlet of Forney. =Georgia= US 411 enters Georgia at the western terminus of its companion SR 53 in the southwestern corner of Floyd County. The two-lane highway, which is named Gadsden Road, has a brief concurrency with SR 100, which heads north as Fosters Mill Road and south as Mill Street, on the west side of the town of Cave Spring. US 411 enters town along Alabama Street and leaves to the northeast along Rome Street. The U.S. Highway continues as Cave Spring Road, which crosses Cedar Creek and passes through Vans Valley. US 411 passes under the West Rome Bypass and intersects US 27 and SR 1 (Cedartown Highway), which US 411 joins heading north. The four-lane road with center turn lane passes along the west side of Lindale and between Walker Mountain and Booze Mountain on the west and east, respectively. US 411 and US 27 expand to a divided highway as they enter the city of Rome and then a four-lane freeway as they cross over a Norfolk Southern rail line. The freeway has a diamond interchange with Darlington Drive and Old Lindale Road and a half-diamond interchange with Maple Road. Immediately to the east of the second interchange, US 411 passes through a directional T interchange; US 27, SR 1, SR 20, and SR 53 head north toward downtown Rome and US 411 and SR 20 head east. Immediately to the east of the split, the U.S. Highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 101 (Dean Avenue); there is no ramp from SR 101 to westbound US 411. The freeway ends east of SR 101. US 411 has an intersection with the southern end of SR 1 Loop (East Rome Bypass) before leaving the city limits. US 411 heads east along Cartersville Highway into Bartow County. The four-lane divided highway parallels and then crosses the Etowah River. US 411 crosses over an east-west CSX rail line immediately before its trumpet interchange with US 41 and SR 3 (Joe Frank Harris Parkway). The two U.S. Highways head southeast into the city of Cartersville then diverge immediately to the east of a north-south CSX rail line at the boulevard's partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 61 (Tennessee Street). Immediately to the north of the interchange, SR 20 (Canton Highway) splits east and SR 61 becomes US 411's companion highway toward Tennessee. The U.S. Highway heads north as a four-lane undivided highway that becomes divided temporarily through the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-75 (Larry McDonald Memorial Highway). US 411 drops to two lanes south of the town of White, where the highway begins to closely parallel the north-south CSX rail line. The U.S. Highway intersects SR 140 (Henry Mack Hill Road) in the hamlet of Rydal before entering Gordon County. US 411 passes through the town of Fairmount as Salacoa Street; the U.S. Highway runs concurrently with SR 53 between Calhoun Street and Fairmount Highway. North of the town of Ranger, through which the route is named Tennessee Highway, the highway meets the eastern end of SR 156 (Red Bud Road). US 411 passes through the town of Oakman, then diverges from a road called Old Highway 411, crosses to the west side of the railroad, intersects SR 136 (Nicklesville Road), and enters Murray County. The U.S. Highway passes to the west of Reregulation Reservoir and Carters Lake, both impoundments of the Coosawattee River, which the highway crosses to the west of the lakes. US 411 intersects US 76 and SR 282, which follow part of Old Highway 411 before heading east through the Cohutta Mountains, and the U.S. Highways begin to run concurrently as a four-lane undivided highway along the west flank of Fort Mountain. US 411 and US 76 continue as 3rd Avenue through the city of Chatsworth. In the center of town, the highways intersect Fort Street, which carries SR 2 and SR 52 east toward Fort Mountain and State Route 52 Alternate to the west. At the north end of town, US 76 and SR 52 leave US 411 along G.I. Maddox Boulevard. The U.S. Highway passes along the west flank of Camp Ground Mountain and is named Hill Street through the town of Eton, where the route meets the eastern end of SR 286 (Coffey Road) and drops to two lanes. US 411 passes through the town of Crandall, crosses to the east side of the railroad, and follows the Fairy Valley to the hamlet of Cisco, where SR 2 splits to the west. US 411 crosses over to the west side of the rail line in the hamlet of Tennga immediately before reaching the Georgia-Tennessee state line, where SR 61 has its northern terminus. =Tennessee= US 411 crossing Conasauga Creek, near Etowah, Tennessee US 411 enters Tennessee at the southern terminus of its companion SR 33 in the southwestern corner of Polk County. The highway crosses the Conasauga River in the hamlet of Conasauga and meets the eastern end of SR 313 (Ladd Springs Road) in Oldfort. US 411 parallels the CSX rail line through the hamlet of Ocoee, where the highway expands to four lanes plus a center turn lane and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 64 and US 74 (SR 40). North of Ocoee, US 411 crosses over the railroad and the Ocoee River and passes through the town of Benton, where the route meets the northern end of SR 314 (Parksville Road). The U.S. Highway expands to a divided highway north of the town. US 411 intersects and begins to run concurrently with SR 30, crosses the Hiwassee River, and meets the eastern end of SR 163 in the village of Delano. US 411 becomes undivided and crosses over the CSX rail line shortly after entering McMinn County. In the town of Etowah, the highway follows Tennessee Avenue, meets the western end of SR 310 (Mecca Pike), and SR 30 splits west along David M. Lilliard Memorial Highway. The highway becomes divided once again north of town and continues through farmland and countryside before becoming undivided once again before entering the town of Englewood and goes through town passing just east of the downtown area and intersecting and having a short concurrency with SR 39 (Athens Pike; Tellico Street). US 411 then becomes a divided highway again as it leaves Englewood and enters countryside once again before crossing into Monroe County. US 411 continues through countryside before entering the city of Madisonville and becomes undivided for a short distance before having an intersection with its former alignment, which travels through downtown (Old US Highway 411), before becoming divided and having a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 68 (New Highway 68), which provides access to Sweetwater, The Lost Sea, Tellico Plains, Cherohala Skyway and the Cherokee National Forest, before going along a bypass of downtown as a divided highway passing through a major business district. US 411 then has an grade-separated interchange with its former alignment (Warren Street) before becoming undivided before leaving Madisonville and continuing north as a 4-lane divided highway through farmland and countryside. US 411 then comes to an intersection and becomes concurrent with SR 72 (Loudon Highway) just before entering the town of Vonore and becoming undivided once again as this time it passes straight through downtown instead of bypassing it. It has an intersection SR 360, which provides access to Fort Loudoun and Fort Loudoun State Park, before leaving Vonore via crossing a bridge over the Little Tennessee River/Tellico Lake before SR 72 splits off and goes east following the banks of the lake before becoming divided once again before crossing into Loudon County. It then becomes undivided shortly afterwards though it doesn't pass by any businesses or towns as it stays in farmland as it becomes known as Greenback Road. It then passes just south of the community of Greenback and meeting the southern end of SR 95, which provides access to the community. US 411 then continues through countryside and farmland to cross into Blount County. US 411 continues through farmland as an undivided 4-lane highway and has an intersection with SR 336 northeast of the community of Lanier. It then continues through farmland before entering the city of Maryville and becoming concurrent with US 129 (SR 115) (Calderwood Highway; provides access to Calderwood, Tallassee, and the Tail of the Dragon) and pass by a few businesses before really entering the business district at the intersection with SR 335 (William Blount Drive). They continue through a major business district before coming to grade-separated interchange where US 411 and US 129 split with US 129 bypassing downtown to enter Alcoa and provide access to McGhee Tyson Airport and Knoxville and US 411 continues north into downtown next to Foothills Mall. US 411 continues into downtown, as Broadway Avenue, and comes to an intersection with US 321 (SR 73) (Lamar Alexander Parkway; provides access to Walland, Townsend, Wears Valley, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park). It then has another intersection with SR 336 before traveling through the center and most historic part of the city before coming to an intersection with SR 35 (Hall Road/Washington Street), with SR 33 continuing north to Knoxville and US 411 turning right to become concurrent with SR 35 (its new companion route). It follows Washington Street for a short distance before turning left onto Sevierville Road, at an intersection with SR 447 (Washington Street), and leaves downtown.

It is owned by the American company Mars, Incorporated. It is available either as meat-like pieces in cans, pouches, or dry biscuits. Most packaging has a recognisable purple color and a stylized silhouette of a cat's head. History Whiskas, originally known as Kal Kan, started manufacturing pet foods in 1936 from its headquarters near Los Angeles, California. It eventually grew its operations across the United States. In 1958, it entered the UK market under the Whiskas brand, which was later expanded throughout Europe. The company was bought by Mars Inc. in 1968, and became a subsidiary of Petfoods Ltd (later re‚Äênamed Pedigree Petfoods). In 1989, Kat Kan changed its name in the U.S. to Whiskas, to bring it under a single international brand (in line with their European operations) and to help unify advertising campaigns globally. Although Kal Kan had more brand equity in the U.S., \\"Whiskas\\" was also found to be perceived by consumers a more likeable and \\"feline-sounding\\" name. In the United States, Whiskas is made in McLean, Virginia by Pedigree Petfoods. Marketing In the U.K., a well-known advertising slogan for Whiskas was \\"eight out of 10 owners said their cat prefers it\\". After a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority, this was changed to \\"eight out of 10 owners who expressed a preference said their cat prefers it\\". The British panel show 8 out of 10 Cats takes its name from the slogan. The slogan has been much imitated ‚Äì in the 1980s, Red Stripe Lager was advertised with the slogan \\"9 out of 10 cats prefer it\\", a play on \\"cat\\" meaning a trendy person. Similarly, a 1987 TV advertisement for Pretty Polly in which a nylon stocking was used to replace the fan belt in a Jaguar car used the slogan \\"So smooth, 9 out of 10 cats prefer them\\"; \\"cat\\" this time is a reference to the make of car featured. In 1999, Australian rules footballer Garry Hocking changed his name by deed poll to \\"Whiskas\\" as part of the Geelong Football Club promotion with the company. It was the first such publicity stunt of its kind. On June 3, 1999, Whiskas singles aired the very first \\"commercial for cats\\" on American TV. The VHS release featured a small segment on how the advert worked, and showed several cats' reactions. The advert itself was a collection of clips with contrasting colours, fish and video captured from underwater. The end of the video (before fading out and then running again) claimed that \\"In our tests, 8 out of 10 preferred it\\". In Hungary, the Whiskas advertising slogan is \\"\\", which means \\"Cats would buy Whiskas (if they could)\\". Slogans with the same meaning are used in Serbia, Germany, Austria, Finland, Estonia, France, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Russia, Romania, Poland and Slovenia. In Denmark, there once was an advertising slogan \\"\\", which means \\"Cats would choose Whiskas.\\" In Sweden, a similar slogan is used: \\"\\", which means \\"Whiskas ‚Äì If the cat itself gets to choose.\\" In Russia, the slogan was \\"\\", which means \\"Your kitty would buy Whiskas\\", where the phrase is rhymed, since one of the words for \\"kitty\\" and \\"Whiskas\\" rhyme in Russian. In Italian speaking countries the slogan 'i gatti comprerebbero Whiskas' - \\"cats would buy Whiskas\\" has long been in use.https://www.coop- pronto.ch/it/approfittare-vincere/rivista-clienti-e- concorsi/-dl-/files/coop_pronto/inhaltsbilder/Kundenmagazin/2016/04/PRONTO_NR4_ITAL_ALLE.pdfhttp://avanti.senato.it/avanti/files/Avanti%201896-1993%20PDF/17.%20Avanti%20Ed.%20Nazionale%201990-1993%20OCR/Ocr%20-D-/CFI0422392_19911229-19911230.95-283_d.pdf References External links *Whiskas USA *Whiskas Malaysia *Whiskas Canada *Whiskas Australia Category:Cat food brands Category:Mars brands ","title":"Whiskas"},{"id":"902464","text":"Dakhlet Nouadhibou Region (, Wilayat Dakhlet Nouadhibou, \\"Interior Nouadhibou Region\\") is an administrative division of Mauritania.

Geography The region is named after the Dakhlet Nouadhibou Bay and contains Mauritania's part of the Cabo Blanco peninsula. It is the westernmost region of the country. It borders Western Sahara to the north, the Mauritanian region of Inchiri to the east and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The Bay of Arguin dominates the west of the region, the Banc d'Arguin National Park dominates the south and includes much of the bay's islands, the southernmost of the bay and the southeasternmost parts of the park are not in the region, about a third of the region is a national park area. Nearly all of the country's islands and islets lies in this region and they include Echakcher, Kiaones, Niroumi, Nair, Arel, Tidra, the country's largest island, Kijji, Touffat, Cheddid and sometimes Serenni. Mauritania is mostly covered with desert, with only its western regions around the coast of Atlantic Ocean having some vegetation. There are some oasis in the desert regions. Since it is a desert, there are large shifting dunes forming temporary ranges. The average elevation is around above the mean sea level. The rainfall in the northern regions closer to the Tropic of Cancer receives around of annual rainfall compared to the southern portions that receives around . The average temperature is , while during the night it reaches . Due to the geography, the inhabitants historically, have been nomadic. In modern times, people have migrated to urban centres during the drought in 1970 and 1980. There are a few sedentary cultivators, who are located only in the Southern regions of the country. Research has indicated that the Saharan movement has resulted in reduction of rains in the region from the 1960s, when it received close to of rainfall. Local administration Dakhlet Nouadhibou Region The local administration is adopted from French local administration framework with the Ministry of Internal Control governing the local bodies. The original administration was held by Governors of each district, but after the municipal elections in 1994, the powers have been decentralized from the district bodies. Nouadhibou is one of 15 wilayas (regions). The smallest administrative division in the region is the commune. A group of communes form a moughataa (department) and a group of moughataa form a district. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on the hakem in the moughataa. The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. The Local Governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with Senate and Parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2006. Settlements outside the capital includes Agadir or Arguin, Arkeiss, R'Geiba, Iouik (or Iwik), Tanoudert, Teichott, Ten- Alloul and Tessot.

The 4th Battalion joined the Indian Army as the 5th Battalion, 8th Gorkha Rifles (Sirmoor Rifles), where it exists to this day. As part of the British Army, the regiment served in Malaya, Hong Kong and Brunei until 1994 when it was amalgamated with the other three British Army Gurkha regiments to form the Royal Gurkha Rifles. It is the only Gurkha regiment which did not have a khukuri on its cap badge.Lawrance Ordnance ‚Äì Gurkha (British Army) Regiment Badges Formation and early service The regiment was first raised in 1815 as The Sirmoor Battalion.Parker 2005, p. 46. This was the first Gurkha unit in the service of the East India Company to see action, during the 3rd Mahratta War in 1817. The regiment, by now named the 8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion, gained its first battle honour at Bhurtpore in 1825. During the First Sikh War, the regiment fought at Bhudaiwal and Sobraon, as well as the Battle of Aliwal. Personnel carried colours at the time, and the flagpole was broken by cannon fire. The colour itself was seized by the Sikhs but reclaimed by a small party of Gurkhas led by a Havildar who chopped their way into the densely packed enemy lines.Chappell 1993, p. 13. Kabul expeditionary force on the march: Quarter Guard of the 3 Gorkha Rifles. 30 November 1878. During the Indian Mutiny, the Sirmoor Battalion was one of the Indian regiments that remained loyal to Britain. It was during this that the regiment took part in the defence of Hindu Rao's House, near Delhi. For their part in the action, the Sirmoor Battalion was presented with the Queen's Truncheon, which became a replacement for the colours that they relinquished when the regiment became a rifle regiment in 1858.Rifle regiments by tradition did not possess Colours. With the decision to number the Gurkha regiments in 1861, the Sirmoor Rifles became the 2nd G√∫rkha Regiment.

First World War During the First World War, the 2nd Gurkhas (by now named the 2nd King Edward's Own Gurkha Rifles), along with the other regiments of the Gurkha Brigade, served initially in Flanders. In 1915, the 2nd Battalion moved to Egypt, before returning to India in 1916. The 1st Battalion went to Persia and Mesopotamia in 1916, assisting in the fall of Baghdad.Chappell 1993, pp. 14‚Äì15. In 1919 it was assigned to the Norperforce in Iran. Second World War The Second World War saw the 2nd Gurkhas serving in many different theatres; the 1st Battalion was initially in Cyprus before moving to North Africa as part of 7th Indian Infantry Brigade, 4th Indian Division, where it fought at El Alamein. Following this it took part in the invasion of Italy, taking part in the battle for Monte Cassino. The 2nd Battalion meanwhile spent much of the war as prisoners of the Japanese after being captured in Malaya. The 3rd Battalion (raised during the war) took part in the Chindit operations in Burma in 1943. Indian independence In 1947, as part of India's independence, it was agreed that the Gurkha regiments would be split between the British and Indian armies‚Äîthe British Army would take on four regiments (the 2nd, 6th, 7th and 10th), while the Indian Army would retain the rest.Parker 2005, p. 224. While the 2nd Gurkhas became one of the four Gurkha regiments to transfer to the British Army, the regiment's 4th Battalion was transferred to the Indian Army as 5th Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles (Sirmoor Rifles) where it exists to this day. The first Indian commanding officer of this battalion, Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier) Nisi Kanta Chatterji, requested Army Headquarters, to let the battalion keep the title 'Sirmoor Rifles', which was accepted. This battalion saw action in the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War (as part of the 3rd (Independent) Armoured Brigade, 28 and 191 Infantry Brigades) where it stopped the advance of the Pakistani armour to Akhnur in the Battle of the Fatwal Ridge. In the 1971 war against Pakistan, the battalion now as part of the 68th Mountain Brigade, the corps reserves, once again saw fierce action in the defence of Chamb-Akhnur.

Following this, the regiment's two battalions alternated between Malaya, Borneo, Brunei and Hong Kong, before receiving a regimental depot at Church Crookham in Hampshire. In 1992, while serving in Hong Kong, the 1st and 2nd Battalions amalgamated to form a single 1st Battalion.

These were worn with loose fitting blue trousers and a bonnet like headdress. By 1828 black facings, black leather equipment, white trousers and sandals had been issued. A variety of changes followed but the round Kilmarnock cap with red and black dicing had appeared by 1848.W. Y.

In 1858 links forged during the Siege of Delhi led to the authorization of the Gurkha regiment to adopt the red piping and facings of the British 60th Rifles. Formally recognized as a rifle regiment since 1850 the 2nd Gurkha Regiment underwent various changes of title as recorded above. Throughout it wore the standard Gurkha parade and cold weather uniform of rifle green with leggings and then puttees, silver insignia and black metal buttons. A red toorie (bobble) on the cap was to remain a distinction of the 2nd Gurkha Rifles. In 1883 khaki (initially blue/grey) hot weather dress was adopted. The broad brimmed hat was worn with khaki drill service dress from 1902 and was retained as normal uniform between the two world wars. After World War I the historic green was limited to a few limited dress orders such as officers' mess uniforms and full dress for mess orderlies.

Originally Cypriot ŒõŒ¨œÄŒ±Œ∏ŒøœÇ Lapathos. ) is a town in Cyprus. De facto, it is under the control of Northern Cyprus. Archeologists claim that Lapithos was founded by the Achean brothers Praxandros and Cepheus. According to Strabo, the ancient settlement of Lapathus, the site of which is nearby, was founded by Spartans. In Assyrian inscriptions, Lapithos is mentioned as one of the eleven Cypriot kingdoms. During the Persian rule, Lapithos was settled by Phoenicians for a while. The last independent king Praxippos was subdued by Ptolemy I in 312 BC. Lambousa is the name currently used for the ancient Roman town on the coast about north of the current Lapta. The coast at Lapithos History =Pre-Roman= Strabo wrote that Lapethos is a 'construction of the Laconians and of Praxandros'. The philosopher Alexander of Ephesus called it \\"Imeroessa\\", meaning \\"attractive\\" and \\"passion-arousing\\". Lapithos is usually referred in archaeological literature as a Laconian colony built after the Trojan War, by Praxandros, its first king. However, findings from excavations i.e. pots and pottery wheels date back its existence as early as 3000 BC. According to Diodoros of Sicily, who wrote in the 4th century BC, Lapithos was one of the nine kingdoms of Cyprus. Peisistratos, king of Lapithos, with his flotilla, together with Nicocreon of Salamis and Stasanor of Curion, came to the aid of Alexander the Great, helping him to capture Tyre in Phoenicia. For this reason Alexander, the victorious army commander, declared Cyprus free from the Persians. The last king of Lapethos was Praxippos. =Roman, Byzantine and Luisignan periods= Map showing the ancient city-kingdoms of Cyprus During the period of the Roman Empire, Lapethos had more than 10,000 inhabitants. It formed one of the four districts of Cyprus. From ancient times, Lapithos became a centre for the processing of copper and more importantly an earthenware centre. During the proto-Christian period (25 BC ‚Äì 250 AD) Lapethos experienced a great commercial drive because of the plethora of its produce, but also because of its port and its shipyard. During this period Lapethos was given the name Lambousa, \\"shining\\", maybe because of its shining wealth or because of its shining beauty and cleanliness or because of its lighthouse, which shed shining light to the surrounding region. During the first years of Christianity the apostles Paul, Barnabas and Mark passed by Lapethos coming from Tarsus. According to Apostle Barnabas, Lapethos had city walls. He cites that during his second tour with Apostle Mark, they stayed outside the walls because they were not given access to the city. In late antiquity, Lapethos enjoyed great prosperity in commerce as well as in riches, art and development. Bishop of Lapithos Theodotos (c. 314‚Äì324) died a martyr in Kyrenia while Bishop Didymos was represented at the 4th Ecumenical Synod (451) by Saint Eulaleus or Eulampius, whose chapel can still be found near the Acheiropoietos Monastery. Lapethos was heavily damaged during the Arab incursions. The population often had to flee and take refuge in the interior. Upon the Byzantine recovery of Cyprus from the Arabs in 965, Lapithos's refugees returned to their town to rebuild it in a new location, but chose to stay away from the sea, relocating it to the foot of mountain Pentadactylos. During the Lusignan period, Lapithos boasted a greater population than Limassol, Famagusta or Paphos. 3000 troops were stationed at Lapithos under the command of Zanetto Dandolo in the years preceding the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571. Dandolo was killed during the defence of Nicosia. =Ottoman period= In 1780 a section of Lapithos was split off to form a new village, Karavas. =British rule= Lapithos in the late 1920s Lapithos became a municipality soon after the transfer of power to the British rule, with Andreas Koumides becoming the first mayor. Geography Landscape near Lapithos Situated about 14 kilometres west of Kyrenia, on the northern coast of Cyprus, on the East it borders with Karavas, on the West with Basileia, on its south with the villages of Sysklhpos, Agridaki, and Larnaka tis Lapithou. It spreads from the high mountains of Pentadactylos to the waters of the Mediterranean. In fact, it rests against the background of the highest peak of Pentadactylos, the Kyparissovouno. Economy A beach and a house standing by it in Lapithos. Tourism is an important source of income for the town. A hotel in Lapithos Civil servants and workers constitute the majority of the working population. Tourism, agriculture, small-scale industry and fishing are also important sources of income, practised by the rest of the population. = Agriculture = Thanks to its spring, Lapithos has rich water resources and fertile land. This results in an agricultural sector with a diverse range of products. Citrus is a major product, the lemons of Lapithos are especially renowned. In the hills, olive and carob trees grow. Among other trees and crops cultivated are pistachio, konari and kolokas/kolokasi. Mulberry trees are also planted and provide the protection of lemon trees from the salt and winds of the sea, as well as the silk that is used in the silk industry and handicrafts. Lapithos also has a great variety of plums, including the \\"flokkaroues\\" variety unique to the town. Politics = Turkish Cypriot municipality = The Municipality of Lapithos (Lapta) that de facto administers the town was founded on 19 November 1974 by the cabinet of the Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration. The current mayor is Fuat Namsoy of the National Unity Party. He has been in this position since 1994. = Greek Cypriot municipality = The Municipality of Lapithos was established in 1878 by the British as one of the ten new municipalities after the beginning of their rule in Cyprus. The municipality has horned Athena on its logo, in reference to an ancient coin found in Lapithos. In 1974, this municipality was forced into exile, and its municipal council operating then stayed at their positions until 1987. The municipality is currently located at 37 Ammochostou Street and shares its headquarters with the municipality-in- exile of Kythrea. The current mayor-in-exile is Neoptolemos Kotsapas. Before 1974, the village was administratively divided into six parishes (), each with its own civil and religious administration, community council, an ecclesiastical authority with a Greek Orthodox priest, and cemetery. The parishes were as follows: * Upper Lapithos: the parishes of Ayia Anastasia and Ayia Paraskevi, collectively referred as the Pano Enories (Upper Parishes) * Ayios Theodhoros in the west * Timios Prodhromos in the centre * Ayios Loukas in the centre * Ayios Minas in the east. In addition to these parishes, the seventh administrative division was the Turkish Cypriot quarter. Churches and mosques Timios Prodromos Church in Lapithos Saint Evlalios Church Acheiropoietos Monastery Lapithos has 14 churches, two mosques and two monasteries. These include: * Saint Theodoros Church: The church was built in 1834. It has two white pillars with Byzantine crosses in its yard a gallery section dated to the 17th century, with well-painted doors. It is rumoured to have previously been a chapel in a cemetery, and also has an olive press. * Saint Minas Church: Located in the east, the church was built in 1843. The church has icons of Saint Minas on a horse, it also used to have a large icon of Saint Minas from the early 18th century. * Saint Anastasia Church and Monastery: The church is located on a position that overlooks Lapithos, where the former Lapithos Castle used to stand. It was built in the 18th century and has many religious depictions on the walls. It has a chapel dedicated to Ayia Evdokia. * Saint Paraskevi Church: It was built next to the ruins of an old church in 1892 and housed icons from this old church until 1974, when they were looted following the invasion. * Saint Luka Church: It was built in 1850. It has been renovated and is now used as a ballet school. * Timios Prodromos Church: The church is in the centre of Lapithos. It was built in the 17th century in the Gothic style. The bell tower has depictions of human faces, animals and plants. The west side has a Star of David on the walls. * Saint Evlalios Church: The church is located at the coast, to the east of the Acheiropoietos Monastery and is dedicated to Saint Evlalios, who was a bishop who once lived in Lambousa. The present-day church was built on the ruins of an early Christian church, whose remains still stand in the form of the four columns of the central arches of the present-day church. One of these columns has a Byzantine cross engraved in it. In excavations, three different layers of mosaic tiles from three different eras have been found. This indicates that the church has been renovated in the 6th, 11th and 14th‚Äì15th centuries. * Saint Evlambios Church: To the east of the Ahkiropietos Monastery, the church was used as a pagan tomb and was later converted to a chapel in the early Christian era. The niches are characteristic of Roman tombs and traces of frescoes are present. It has no narthex, but does have an abscess. The mosques are as follows: * Haydar Pashazade Mehmet Bey Mosque: There is an engraving in the mosque indicating the year of 1870, this could be the date of the renovation or the construction of the mosque. It has a unique feature in terms of its architecture in Cyprus: a dome covers the prayer area and rests on an octagonal drum and a small half dome at the four corners. Due to its unique Ottoman architecture, it has been described as \\"one of the island's most handsome stone mosques\\". * Esseyid Elha√ß Mehmet Agha Mosque, also known as the Upper Lapta Mosque: It is made of hewn stone and has a rectangular structure. It was first built by the tax collector Esseyid Elha√ß Mehmet Agha in 1828, but this mosque had an earthen roof and no minaret. Between 1887 and 1889, the Sayed Mehmet Agha Foundation, led by the trustee Hadji Veli Effendi, built a patio, tile roof coverings and a 25-foot minaret. In 1899, there was also a school that belonged to the same foundation. The hewn stone minaret on the mosque's eastern side was demolished in 1974 and the present-day concrete minaret was constructed in 1976.  Culture  The town annually hosts the Lapta Tourism Festival in the first week of June. Numerous cultural and sporting activities, folk dance shows by groups from various countries and concerts take place during the festival. Lapithos has a unique needlework with original patterns, known as the Lapta lace (). The handicraft is still preserved as a product for tourists, and is made on linen fabric with the cross-stitch technique. Lapithos have also produced the culturally important walnut wood chests for Cyprus. The town also has a tradition of knife-making; its knives traditionally had handles made of goat horn and were known for the sharpness and workmanship. The town is one of the most important silk- producing centres in the island and has been historically that way. The silk is used locally and island-wide in handicrafts and for weaving. Lapithos hosts a vibrant sports life concentrated on the sea. Water sports such as diving, windsurfing, jet-skiing, water-skiing and parasailing are popular. Horse riding and cycling are also practised. The town is the centre of several hiking trails protected by Natura 2000; these trails pass through the area's forests, ruins of ancient cities and temples, churches and historical warehouses. The town is home to the football club Lapta T√ºrk Birliƒüi S.K. They played in S√ºper Lig, the top-level division of Turkish Cypriot football in the 2014‚Äì15 season, but were relegated as they attained the last place.

At a time when most passenger trains carried neither dining cars nor lounge cars, private businessmen such as the Van Noys recognized a profit opportunity by operating eating houses at railroad junction points and selling snacks and novelties aboard the trains. History Missouri Pacific and Iron Mountain Railways. In 1893, Ira Clinton Van Noy formed a retail cigar and news business at No. 1076 Union Avenue, in Kansas City, Missouri. Four years later, on July 26, 1897, he joined with two of his brothers, Charles S. Van Noy and J.L. Van Noy, along with G.W. Krebs of St. Louis, to incorporate the Van Noy Railroad News Company. Railroad 'news services' generally sold magazines, newspapers, books, tobacco products, fruits, nuts, and novelties from newsstands located in train stations and by the use of a 'news butch', a young man who walked through the train making sales. As the business flourished, the Van Noy brothers became prominent members of local Kansas City society. I.C. Van Noy, the eldest brother, served as president of the company, and the youngest brother, Henry Clay Van Noy, also joined the company when he came of age. The Van Noy Railroad News Company grew rapidly after securing large contracts with Missouri Pacific Railway and its subsidiary, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway. In the era before dining cars were carried on trains, Van Noy eating houses were established at points along the Missouri Pacific system to feed passengers. Later, at important terminals and train crew division points, Van Noy hotels were constructed to house both travelers and railroad train crews laying over between trips. Reflecting the success of the company, in 1909 both I.C. Van Noy and C.S. Van Noy constructed large homes at 6700-6800 Elmwood in Kansas City. The two homes were added the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. By 1910, the Van Noy Railroad News Company controlled sales distribution along of railroad. The Company also had 52 hotels and restaurants, 20 concession stores, and 21 distribution offices. The employee count at this time was about 1,600. In 1912, the company name was changed to the Van Noy Railway Hotel and News Company, reflecting the company's increased emphasis on the hotel side of the business. In 1916, when he was 15 years old, Walt Disney spent a summer working for the Van Noy Interstate Company as a news butch, selling merchandise on various rail lines radiating out of Kansas City. His first run was from Kansas City to Jefferson City on the Missouri Pacific Railroad, but he also made runs on the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, and Kansas City Southern Railway, according to an article that Disney wrote years later for Railroad Magazine. Van Noy hotel constructed in Newport, Arkansas in 1907. Note how hotel follows architectural style of adjacent depot which had been constructed five years earlier. Signs on corner of building say \\"Van Noy Dining Room\\", while sign over door says \\"Van Noy Lunch Room.\\" Van Noy Railway Hotel and News began a series of mergers and acquisitions in 1914, starting with the Brown News Company (also headquartered in Kansas City) which was acquired on October 1, 1914. In 1915, the company began consolidating operations with the New York City-based Interstate News Company. The company name was changed to Van Noy Interstate News Company in 1917, but the company headquarters remained in Kansas City under the leadership of Ira C. Van Noy. In 1922, the company owned distribution avenues covering of railroad, and had accumulated a massive portfolio of concession stands, stores, restaurants, and hotels. However, the need for railroad news services and en route eating houses was declining as railroads added dining cars to more trains. In early 1923, Missouri Pacific Railroad ended their long standing affiliation with Van Noy Interstate, although Van Noy continued to operate hotels at some smaller terminals where train crews ended their runs. Van Noy Hotel or Eating House Locations This is a partial list of known Van Noy establishments. *Arkansas: Bald Knob, Benton, El Dorado, Fort Smith, Gurdon, Hope, Knobel, McGehee, Newport, Van Buren, Wynne. *Kansas: Coffeyville, Council Grove, Downs, Goff, Greenleaf, Hoisington. *Missouri: Bismark, Delta, Joplin, Poplar Bluff. *Louisiana: Monroe *Oklahoma: Wagoner Evolution away from Railway Service As a result of changes in railroad passenger train service, Van Noy Interstate began to focus more on the hotel side of their operations. In 1922, the Company acquired the Gem Fountain Company, and in 1926 the company began operating as the Interstate Company. The Interstate Company operated restaurants in train stations, as well as lunch rooms in bus stations. One of the more famous hotels owned by the company was the Beverly Hills Hotel, owned and operated by Interstate between 1928 and 1932. The Van Noy family's involvement in the Company ended following the death of the last surviving Van Noy Brother, Henry Clay Van Noy. Horizons were broadened in 1954, when the Interstate Company was awarded its first airport contract at the San Francisco International Airport. Numerous name changes and corporate consolidations took place as the surviving company moved further from its roots as a railroad news service, although the company remained in the core business of providing services to travelers. By the time that the Interstate Company became Interstate HOSTS in 1959, all railroad station restaurant operations had ended. In 1968, the name was again changed to Host International, and this company was then acquired by the Marriott Corporation in 1982 and was then renamed to Host Marriott Corporation. On March 22, 2002, Autogrill S.p.A. purchased the Host Marriott Services division from the Marriott Corporation. Through this acquisition, Autogrill gained contracts in 18 of the 20 largest United States airports as well as franchises such as Pizza Hut, Burger King, Sbarro, and Starbucks. Increased revenue from these acquisitions allowed Autogrill to expand heavily into Europe‚Äôs successful railway systems ‚Äì the original transportation mode embraced by the Van Noy Railway News Company. Autogrill renamed the company HMSHost, which is largely the corporate successor to the 1897 Van Noy operation and continues to provide products, services, and entertainment to customers on the go. The hotel and resorts assets of the original Van Noy operation was spun off from Marriott as the Host Marriott Corporation in 1996. Today, the company is called Host Hotels and Resorts and is a Real estate investment trust, employing some 229 employees.

The colors of postage stamps are at once obvious, and among the most difficult areas of philately. Different denominations of stamps have been printed in different colors since the very beginning; as with their successors, postal clerks could distinguish the Penny Black and Two pence blue more quickly by color than by reading the value, and the practice generally continues today. In practice, the actual color of a stamp may vary, and while collectors will pay high prices for rare shades, it may not be easy to tell those apart from variations caused by age, light, chemicals, and other factors. Stamp colors are routinely described by color name rather with any sort of a numerical system like CMYK; several color guides showing a selection of colors have been produced, but are not especially popular with collectors. Nearly all stamps get their color from inks printed on white or light-colored paper; the handful of exceptions include early issues of Natal consisting only of embossing on colored paper, some recent stamps embossed on gold foil or with foil blocking to achieve a metallic appearance, and the Uganda Cowries produced on a typewriter. A number of early stamps were printed in black on differently-colored papers; the most famous example is the British Guiana 1c magenta.  History  Red was the UPU standard for domestic letters; the 2c rate in the US lasted from 1883-1917 and 1919-1932. Initially, countries typically made a random choice of colors for denominations. In 1896, the members of the Universal Postal Union agreed on green, red, and blue as the standard colors for standard printed matter, postcard, and letter rates, respectively, when sent abroad. This convention was gradually abandoned as inflation created too many exceptions from the 1930s and onwards. Switzerland used three colors in 1850 for its first stamps, then switched to a single-color design in 1854. Stamps with two colors (\\"bi- colored\\") began to appear very early, although typically reserved for higher values, due to the added expense of multiple print runs. Multicolored stamps appeared along with the development of color printing techniques; they now account for the majority of modern stamps, although single-color designs are still common, more so for some countries than others.  Shades and color changes  Color shades have several different causes. The printer may use a different ink; in the early days, inks were made up in batches as needed, and were rarely consistent. In such cases, the shade provides information about when the stamp was made, and possibly even identify a particular printing. Extreme variations may be considered color errors; for instance, the 4c value of the US Columbian Issue of 1893 was normally printed in ultramarine, but a handful were printed in blue, a shade with distinctly more green; these are worth in the US$10,000 range instead of the usual $10. Inks may also be diluted or applied more thinly, as for instance the World War I stamps of Germany and World War II stamps of the United Kingdom. It can also happen randomly, if a printing plate is accidentally under-inked. Ultraviolet light is destructive to a great many pigments, and can cause considerable lightening. In addition, some countries have used water-soluble materials known as fugitive inks to prevent postage stamp reuse. Stamps of this type may be much lighter in color after being soaked. Some dramatic color variations occur as a result of chemical action; such stamps are called color changelings. Examples include sulfuretting (often misnamed \\"oxidation\\"), a reaction involving lead that may turn a blue or green stamp to black, and the effects of salt water, famously seen in stamps of New South Wales recovered from the wreck of the Colombo. Forgers have also used chemicals to try to produce seeming rarities, although by now experts know how to identify these attempts.  Nomenclature  In general, collectors follow the stamp catalogs in matters of color nomenclature, even though the different catalogs are not consistent with each other. Although there are a great many named colors, the selection used by philatelists is limited to several dozen, modified by adjectives such as \\"dark\\", \\"light\\", \\"pale\\", \\"bright\\" and \\"deep\\". In addition, two color names may be combined, as in \\"gray green\\" or \\"brown orange\\", where the first name indicates the direction of modification to the second color. Thus \\"brown orange\\" is a duller and darker orange, while \\"orange brown\\" has a tinge to it that is more orange than would be seen with a \\"yellow brown\\" or \\"red brown\\". This system becomes less clear when extended to other colors, and few collectors could describe precisely how \\"carmine rose\\" is different from \\"rose carmine\\". Certain colors such as \\"lake\\", a shade of red which often commands a price premium, have a traditional, but somewhat uncertain, meaning which differs from general usage of \\"lake\\" in terms of pigments and dyes. Originally, government-issued official descriptions merely gave out a primary name such as \\"red\\" for a whole range of shades. In more recent years, the descriptions have become more precise, such as \\"dark sage green\\", though not necessarily enlightening collectors any more than previously.

The Shadow line features motorcycles with a liquid-cooled 45 or 52-degree V-twin engine ranging from 125 to 1,100 cc engine displacement. The 250 cc Honda Rebel is associated with the Shadow line in certain markets. History In 1983, Honda introduced the Shadow series of motorcycles in an attempt to address the needs of the American cruiser market with the VT500c and VT750c. However, due to tariff restrictions in the United States on imported Japanese bikes over 701 cc, the VT750c was reduced to 700 cc in 1984 and was sold as the Vt700c. In 1985, the tariff was lifted and the line soon expanded to an 1,100 cc bike the VT1100c. The VT750c was replaced by an 800 cc version the VT800c in 1988. The VT600c was launched in 1988 as Honda's new entry level Shadow though still slotted above the Honda Rebel. The line changed little until the introduction of the 750 cc Honda Shadow Ace in 1997. From 2000 to 2007, the Honda Shadow Sabre replaced the VT1100 until the 1,100 cc class was discontinued in favor of the new VTX line, specifically the 1,300 cc offering known as the VTX1300. As of 2011, the Shadow brand has been limited to a single 750 cc cruiser available in Spirit, Aero, Phantom, and RS trims. All other offers are known under the VTX or Rebel brands. The RS and Phantom are the 2 latest additions to the 750 cc line-up from year 2010. Both are Fuel injected. Shadow RS recalls a flat track racing bike with chain drive, a 'peanut' style gas tank and a slightly higher seat height ( 29 inches ) with foot pegs less forward than conventional cruisers ( meaning a more standard seating position). Phantom is more like a conventional cruiser in ergonomics. Models =125 cc Class= A red Honda VT125C Shadow The Honda 125 is mainly for the UK and Europe market, as it fits within the restrictions placed on learner drivers in the UK and the light motorcycle license in Europe. It also has a chain drive instead of a shaft drive seen on the larger engined bikes. Sales ended in 2009. =500 cc VT Class= The 500cc \\"VT500C\\" introduced in 1983 featured chrome side covers and black engine covers. The headlight was chrome and rectangular and had a single horn. The engine was the Honda VT500, a OHC three-valve, liquid cooled V-Twin that averaged around 51.7MPG and put out 54HP@9,000RPM and 31ft-Ib of torque @7,000RPM and mated to a six-speed, shaft drive transmission. In 1984, The \\"VT500C' was featured include the fuel tank and rear fenders painted the same. The front fender is chrome and this year the side covers and engine covers were painted black. The headlight was chrome and rectangular and there was a single horn. The engine is virtually the same as the 1983 model. The 1985 \\"VT500C\\" had round and chromed headlamps. This model continued with the dual horns. A two piece seat with an integrated backrest was incorporated. Starting this year, the engine covers were polished chrome and the fins enlarged. The \\"Honda\\" tank decal was curved instead of straight. For the 1986 model year, the \\"VT500C\\" model was virtually the same as the 1985 model. =600 cc VT Class= Honda Shadow VT600 The \\"VLX\\" \\"Shadow 600\\" (aka \\"VT600C\\") was introduced as a new model in 1988. It has a single shock rear suspension, a low seat height and a long wheelbase with a fuel tank. The engine is a SOHC three-valve liquid cooled 52-degree V-Twin that averaged 49.5MPG and generating 39HP @6,500rpm and 36ft-Ib of torque @3,500RPM connected to a four- speed transmission and chain drive. The wheels are spoked. In 1989, The VLX VT600C remained largely the same. The VT600C was not made in 1990 but did make a comeback in 1991 offered only in black. The engine and body style was retained from the 1991 model year. A new deluxe version \\"VT600CD\\" introduced in 1993 added more chrome on the engine cases and valve covers. The seat on the deluxe version is soft and tucked. By 1994 the Deluxe model was a standard offering for every year the VLX was made. =700-800 cc VT class= A 1983 model year 750cc V-twin motorcycle is the senior member in the large family of Honda cruisers (of various sizes) named Shadow. As of 2018 the once-extensive Shadow line has been reduced to two successors of that original model, the Shadow Aero 750 and the Shadow Phantom 750. Even after multiple engine redesigns the current Shadow 750 still uses the same general layout as the 1983 motor: 4-stroke liquid-cooled narrow-angle V-twin, SOHC three-valve cylinder heads with dual spark plugs. VT750C 45¬∞ V-twin The VT750C Shadow debuted in late 1982 for North American markets, and a nearly identical NV750 Custom launched in Japan for Honda's domestic market. Both were propelled by a new 750 cc liquid-cooled four-stroke dual-carburetor SOHC three-valve 45-degree V-twin engine with a six-speed transmission and shaft final drive. The Honda identification code for this type of engine is RC14E. In a January 1983 road test, Cycle said: \\"This 750 twin is built around what is arguably the most technologically sophisticated Vee ever designed.\\" Advanced technology included three-valve two-plug combustion chambers and a vibration-canceling offset dual-pin crankshaft, as well as hydraulic valve adjusters to keep the valvetrain running at effectively zero-clearance while also eliminating routine adjustments. Each cylinder head had a single chain- driven camshaft and an individual downdraft CV carburetor. Engineering innovations appeared in the transmission as well. The clutch was actuated hydraulically rather than through a mechanical cable; a diaphragm clutch spring was used instead of more common coil springs and a slipper clutch eliminated rear-wheel hop during engine braking or quick downshifting. In addition to the V-engine, the Shadow's frame and body incorporated classic American cruiser styling cues: a teardrop fuel tank (with a hidden sub-tank to increase capacity), a low height two-piece seat with sissy bar and backrest, cruiser handlebar, cast wheels, chrome front fender, a round head lamp and instrument casings, large rake angle and angle-cut mufflers. In the US market 1983 was the only model year for the VT750C Shadow, which was available in two colors, Black and Candy Wineberry Red. The VT750C remained available in Canada for the 1984 and 1985 model years nearly unchanged, apart from color, from the 1983 model. For the 1986 model year, Japan's NV750C was renamed Honda Shadow as part of appearance and frame updates, including a lower seat, longer wheelbase, increased rake and trail as well as a rod linkage for the rear brake (previously cable operated). Cast wheels were changed from ten spokes to five. Gold color was added to wheels, crankcase cover and headlight trim. The NV750C Shadow continued to use the RC14E motor. Canadian VT750C models for 1986 were updated in the same manner as the NV750C. The Shadow 750 was exported to Germany in 1987, the last VT750C model year. =VT700C= The VT700C Shadow is among a class of motorcycles (including 700cc Honda Sabre and Magna models) known as \\"tariff-busters.\\" Honda introduced the Shadow 700cc model in 1984 exclusively for the US market in response to tariffs (to protect Harley-Davidson) on Japanese motorcycles with engines over 700cc. Honda took the RC14E 45-degree V-twin and reduced its bore size by to create the smaller displacement RC19E engine which was not subject to the import tariff. The VT700C for 1984 was available in either Black or Candy Scorpio Red; for 1985 the color choices were Black or Candy Glory Red. Both years had painted side covers with a Shadow 700 decal. For 1986 Honda altered the frame and appearance of the VT700C (as with the Canadian and Japanese 750 models) which included lowering the seat, stretching the wheelbase, increasing rake and trail, switching the front brake from dual disks to a single disk and replacing ten-spoke with five-spoke cast wheels. The new frame was designed to suppressed engine vibrations, and a new camshaft improved low-rpm performance with a slight reduction in peak power. The engine was no longer painted black, the front fender was painted instead of chrome plated, and side covers were chrome instead of paint. Side covers displayed the single word Shadow and Honda's wing logotype was showcased on the tank. The passenger backrest was eliminated. Color schemes for 1896 were either Black or Candy Brilliant Red and then Black or Candy Glory for 1987, last model year for the VT700C. =VT800C= Honda VT800 Shadow photographed in Valkenburg, South Holland Honda introduced the VT800C Shadow for 1988, the sixth year of the Shadow series. The 800cc engine had the same bore diameter as the original Shadow 750 engine, and a longer stroke, but was otherwise the same SOHC, three valves per cylinder, 45-degree V-twin engine. Besides having a larger displacement, this new RC32E engine did have another significant difference ‚Äì it had a four-speed transmission. The VT800c ran on spoke-and-rim wheels that required tube-type tires instead of the tubeless tires used on the earlier models with cast wheels. The 1988 Shadow 800 had a new look, with more chrome plating along with two-toned paint on the fuel tank and fenders. Color combinations were Black and Candy Glory Red, or Candy Wineberry Red and Dry Silver Metallic. The tank also wore a simple Shadow decal, rather than the Honda wing. The VT800C was produced only for the North American market, and only for the 1988 model year. VT750C 52¬∞ V-twin, chain drive Honda Shadow 750 Ace Honda brought out a new engine for the VT750C Shadow ACE in 1997 (the ACE or A.C.E. designation, for American Classic Edition, was used only in North America). The RC44E engine had its origin in the 600cc Shadow VLX 52-degree V-twin, enlarged to 750cc by means of a wider bore and a longer stroke. This new engine was similar to the old (RC14E) Shadow 750 in that it had liquid cooling and SOHC three-valve dual-plug combustion chambers, conversely, it lacked hydraulically adjusted valves, offset crankpins and a slipper clutch. Further changes to the drivetrain included a wide-ratio five-speed gearbox (down from six) and a chain final drive instead of shaft. Engine intake was through dual CV carburetors, with Secondary air injection on the exhaust side for emissions control. The VT750C Shadow ACE had full fenders and retro style features similar to the VT1100C Shadow ACE released two years earlier. A chrome plated exhaust had the look of a two-into-one system, but each header pipe had separate channel inside the large muffler, exiting through two tailpipes. North American models had an electronic speedometer and idiot lights mounted on the handlebar, while models for the European and other market had them mounted on the fuel tank. The Shadow 750 was available as a standard or Deluxe model with more chrome (VT750CD) and optional two-tone paint. The 750cc Shadow was also available in Japan as the NV750C (and as a nearly identical Shadow 400cc model) continuing through 2001. The NV750C was also available in South Korea from 1999 to 2001. 1998 through 2000 models of the VT750C continued with annual color changes. From 2001, North American models had the speedometer mounted on the tank (the same as European and Australian versions). The 750cc Shadow ACE was the best-selling model in Honda's 2002 street motorcycle lineup. For 2002 and 2003, rather than the standard VT750C standard model, Honda manufactured only VT750CD (Deluxe) or VT750DC (Spirit) models. =VT750DC= For the 2001 model year, Honda added a slightly modified version of the VT750C to the Shadow line, the VT750DC Shadow Spirit (North American models, Shadow Black Widow in Europe) with lower gearing and street- rod or chopper style bodywork. The VT750DC Shadow was exported to Australia, and Honda's domestic market version was the NV750DC Shadow Slasher. Although the frame and body were new, VT750DC and NV750DC models used the existing RC44E motor with dual CV carburetors. Distinguishing features were a narrower front tire on a 19-inch wheel, slim front fender and a bobbed rear fender. Honda manufactured the VT750DC Shadow Spirit through the 2003 model year, skipped 2004, then resumed production in 2005‚Äë2007 for North America. The last model year for the VT750DC overlapped with its shaft-drive replacement, the 2007 VT750C2 Shadow Spirit. =VT750RS= 2011 Honda Shadow VT750S 2012 Honda VT750S Tricolour Honda announced in 2009 that they would produce a roadster version of the Shadow 750 with chain final drive. Honda Motor Co. originally designed the VT750S, powered by the RC58E fuel-injected 52¬∞ V-twin, for their domestic market. Nonetheless, the made-in-Japan VT750S was exported to Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand. At the request of American Honda, this new model was also exported to North America as the VT750RS (Retro Standard). With the arrival of the VT750RS in 2010, there were four concurrent models in the Shadow 750 lineup: the fuel-injected RS and Phantom, in addition to the carbureted (in North America) Spirit and Aero. Honda kept the Shadow RS on the roster for four model years, from 2010 to 2013 inclusive. With frame geometry that differed significantly from Shadow cruisers, the VT750S and RS models' footpegs, handlebars and seat put the rider into a neutral, upright posture. The seat height of , for example, was higher than most cruisers and a full above that of the Shadow Phantom. Rake and trail were 32.5 degrees and , 1.5 degrees steeper and approximately less than other Shadows. The VT750RS wheelbase of was about shorter. The VT750RS had spoked wheels with tube-type tires, 100/90-19 in front and 150/80-16-inch in back. Brakes were a single 296 mm front disc with a twin-piston caliper and a mechanical drum rear. Several reviewers observed that there was more than a passing resemblance between the VT750RS and Sportster 883 models; Honda's peanut-shaped fuel tank, for instance, emulated classic Sportster tanks. A few road tests included side-by- side comparisons of the Honda and the Harley-Davidson. For the 2011 model year, the VT750RS was painted in Honda Racing tricolors, evocative of the Honda VFR750R. VT750C 52¬∞ V-twin, shaft drive Honda VT 750 C Shadow At the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda exhibited a preproduction \\"low-and-long\\" 750cc Shadow kitted out in retro-style bodywork, equipped with shaft final drive and the Honda Ignition Security System (HISS) electronic anti-theft device. Honda dropped the ACE and Spirit models from the 750cc Shadow line for 2004, manufacturing just the new VT750C Shadow Aero model (chain-drive Spirit production restarted in 2005). The reengineered RC50E engine was still a 52-degree, liquid-cooled V-Twin, single-pin crankshaft configuration. SOHC cylinder heads still had two spark plugs and three valves, but were modified to increase the compression ratio. Engine tuning changes de emphasized peak power in favor of torque at low and mid RPMs. A 2‚Äëinto‚Äë1 exhaust ended in a large muffler containing separate silencers for each cylinder (similar to that on the 750 ACE) as well as a catalytic converter. The dual CV carburetors of the RC44E motor were replaced by a single CV carburetor on the RC50E. A new steel-tube frame with lower frame rails moved the Aero's seat height further down than either of the models it replaced. Honda replaced the 2‚Äëinto‚Äë1 exhaust with a 2‚Äëinto‚Äë2 system for 2008 and subsequent model years, including the 2008‚Äë2009 Shadow Tourer VT750T model equipped with a windscreen, saddlebags and passenger backrest. Except for North America, 2008 VT750C models had programmed fuel injection (PGM-FI) in place of the CV carburetor. Shadow Aero models were given PGM-FI in North America starting with the 2011 model year. Honda offers anti-lock brake options for the 750cc Shadow Aero. Early VT750CA models had front-wheel ABS only, subsequent VT750CS models replace the rear drum brake with a hydraulic disk brake, required for Honda's combined ABS (C-ABS) with individual control of front and rear brakes. Shadow Aero VT750C and VT750CS models remain in the American Honda line-up for 2019. =VT750C2= In 2007 (the twenty-fifth year of the Shadow line) Honda sold three different Shadow 750 cruisers, the original chain-drive Spirit, the shaft-drive Aero and the first Spirit VT750C2. Canadian automotive journalist David Booth said \\"that the VT750C2 is essentially the mechanicals of the VT750C Aero mated to the styling of the VT750D Spirit, with a few essential tweaks.\\" The C2 model inherited its 750cc engine from the Aero, with a CV carburetor for North America and a PGM-FI throttle body elsewhere. The VT750C2 Spirit came by its frame layout from the VT750C Aero as well, but Honda's designers adjusted the new Spirit's geometry to give it a drag-bike or chopper-style appearance. A wheelbase stretched to , a rake angle of 34¬∞30' along with noticeable triple-tree offset gave prominence to bare forks and a 21 inch front wheel (a first for Honda cruisers). The chopper look was reinforced by a two-into-two exhaust system and a seat height reduced to . There were two significant updates to the VT750C2 Spirit. From 2012, North American Spirit models eliminated the carburetor in favor of a PGM-FI throttle body. From 2013, a new Spirit VT750C2S model with antilock front and rear disc brakes (C-ABS) was sold alongside the VT750C2 in the USA and was the only model offered in Europe. Confusingly, the model code VT750C2 had already been used to identify 1997-2001 European and Australian 750 Shadows with two-tone paint. =VT750C2B= The 2010 VT750C2B Shadow Phantom debuted in Fall 2009 powered by a blackened fuel-injected version (engine code RC53E) of the existing Shadow 750 shaft-drive engine. The Phantom's frame and abridged bodywork, based on the Aero 750, were both painted black. This model was called the Shadow Black Spirit in European markets. Honda Motor Europe described the VT750C2B, called Shadow Black Spirit in some European markets, a variant of the VT750C2 Shadow Spirit with \\"authentic bobber styling.\\" In North America, the 2010 model year marked the arrival of PGM-FI equipped Shadow 750 engines, in both Phantom and VT750RS models. The VT750C2B Shadow Phantom remains in the American Honda line-up for 2019. VT750C recall Honda and NHTSA issued a January 2016 recall for 2010 through 2016 VT750C/CA/CS, VT750C2/ C2F/C2S, and VT750C2B models. The NHTSA announcement said that ‚Äúengine vibration may cause the bank angle sensor wire to rub on the wire harness joint connector, resulting in a loss of the sensor signal.‚Äù Honda Motor Company had received reports, dating back to 2013, of engine stall or misfire incidents resulting from bank angle sensor failure. VT400 replica Honda Japan created a series of VT400 models for the Japanese domestic market in 1997, practically identical to the VT750 series but with smaller displacement engines. Among these was the Shadow Slasher, introduced in February 2000. From 2009, Honda Australia imports the VT400 as a Learner Approved Motorcycle alongside the popular VT750. =1,100 cc VT Class= The V-Twin 1100 (VT1100) was introduced by Honda in 1985 and was in continuous production till 2007. All models used an 1099cc displacement engine, the Honda VT1100 engine with minimal mechanical changes during its production. 1985 The VT1100C model was introduced in 1985 as a larger model from the 750/800 cc models. The 1985‚Äì86 models are recognizable by the dual horns below the headlight, square turn signals, dual front disk brakes, and one exhaust pipe on each side (front cylinder on right side, rear cylinder on left). There are dual gauges on the bars for speedometer and tachometer, and fuel and temperature gauges that on the fuel tank. The engine is a SOHC liquid cooled V-twin with a five-speed transmission and shaft drive. the 1985 and 1986 engines were higher performance engines vs later models, having a longer stroke and smaller piston compared to 1987 and later models, allowing this first generation motor to make approximately 76 horsepower. 1987 1994 Honda VT1100C The 1987 VT1100C model took on a brand-new look with a lower seat (), a longer wheelbase , a fuel tank, and an extended front fork. Both exhaust pipes were now run along the right side of the bike, with the horns being relocated to the sides of the engine. The engine, while the same 1099 cc displacement as the previous model, is rated for approximately 60 horsepower due to shorter stroke and larger pistons. It also now had a four-speed transmission with a hydraulically actuated clutch. The \\"VT1100C\\" model was not manufactured in 1991 (to sell off excess stock of 1990 models), but returned in 1992 with a \\"Made in the USA\\" stamp on the seat. Visually, the VT1100C matched most of the styling cues of the Harley-Davidson FXDWG. This styling continued through 1996. 1995 =American Classic Edition (A.C.E.)= 1997 Honda VT1100C ACE Honda Shadow Sabre 1100 In 1995, the V-Twin market really got going, and manufacturers expanded their offerings with variants of their standing models. The American Classic Edition (A.C.E.) (VT1100C2) was introduced this year. It featured a more retro styling than the standard with a full rear fender, induced vibrations, and 'Harley-Davidson-like' sound from a single pin crank engine. The model also lost about 10 hp. 1997 1997 saw the Standard replaced with the Spirit with more chrome on the engine but the same basic engine as the standard. An ACE Tourer was also introduced based on the 1100 Spirit engine but the ACE styling. The ACE Tourer came with a two-into-one- into-two exhaust system, a counterbalanced with a dual crank pin crankshaft, and hard, color-matched saddlebags. The last of the 6,000+ Tourer models was produced in January 2001. 1998 In 1998, 1100cc Honda rolled out the VT1100C3 Aero, based on the VT1100C2 ACE engine with the single pin crank, but a larger two into one exhaust and more retro styling. The 1100 Aero was discontinued after the 2003 model year. 2000 The Honda Shadow Sabre model was introduced, based on the Honda VT1100 engine with different styling than the Spirit model. The most notable feature was the front cast aluminum wheel. This model also had a slightly lower rear gear ratio in the transmission allowing the bike to have better off the line acceleration than the regular Spirit model; however this also caused higher engine RPM at highway speeds. Due to lower sales and the availability of the VTX1300, 2007 was the final year Honda made the VT1100 Shadow.

Education and early career Mouawad was educated at De La Salle School in Tripoli, before pursuing his secondary education at the Saint Joseph College in Aintoura. He went to Saint Joseph University in Beirut, graduating with a law degree in 1947. He subsequently joined the law firm of Abdallah El-Yafi, a former Prime Minister before opening his own law firm in Tripoli in 1951. Parliamentary career Moawad made his first foray into politics in 1951, when he unsuccessfully contested a Zgharta seat in the National Assembly. Although he was defeated, the election forged a crucial alliance between him and the Frangieh clan. He was subsequently elected to the National Assembly in 1957, and reelected in 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1972 - the last parliamentary election held before his election to the presidency (the civil war that raged from 1975 to 1990 prevented further elections from being held in the meantime). In 1952, Moawad was briefly arrested and detained in Aley for participating in the national uprising that forced the resignation of President Bechara El Khoury, Lebanon's first post-independence leader. He also fell out with Khoury's successor, Camille Chamoun, when the latter hinted at a possible constitutional change to extend his six-year term which was due to expire in 1958. He went into exile in Latakia, Syria. It was during his exile that he won his first election to the National Assembly. Moawad became a strong supporter of Chamoun's successor, Fuad Chehab. He chaired the Parliamentary Law Committee and the Finance and Budget Committee. He served as Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in the government of Prime Minister Rashid Karami (also a Chehabist) from 31 October 1961 to 20 February 1964. He later served as Minister of Public Works, again under Karami, from 16 January to 24 November 1969, during the presidency of Chehab's successor, Charles Helou. In 1970, he supported Chehabist presidential candidate and old friend Elias Sarkis against his old ally Suleiman Frangieh. Frangieh won the election by a single vote. On 25 October 1980, Moawad returned to the Cabinet as Minister of National Education and Fine Arts, in the government of President Elias Sarkis (who had succeeded Frangieh in 1976) and Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan, a position he held until the expiry of Sarkis's term on 24 September 1982. The strength of his alliance with Suleiman Frangieh was severely tested in that year, when Moawad voted to support Bachir Gemayel, Frangieh's rival, for the presidency. Despite Frangieh's anger, their friendship was so deep that it survived the test. Election and assassination Following the Taif Agreement to end the civil war, the National Assembly met on 5 November 1989 at the Qoleiat air base in North Lebanon and elected Moawad as President of Lebanon for 409 days after Amine Gemayel vacated this position upon the expiration of his term in 1988. The National Assembly had failed to elect a successor at that time. Seventeen days later, as he was returning from Lebanon's Independence Day celebrations on November 22, 1989, a 250 kg car bomb was detonated next to Moawad's motorcade in West Beirut, killing him and 23 others.Lebanon's president killedNew President of Lebanon killed Chawki Choweiri, Lebanon's UN representative, said \\"This is the major catastrophe of the years of catastrophes we have had so far. We may have lost one of the last opportunities to unite the nation.\\" No credible investigation into the murder has ever been carried out. To this day, the identity and motives of those responsible remain a matter of debate.Lebanon A Bomb Aimed at Peace - TIME Returning from the Cedar Revolution protest against the Syrian occupation on 14 March 2005, Nayla Moawad declared, \\"The independence of Lebanon was regained on March 14, and on March 14 I felt that I avenged (my husband's) assassination.\\". Personal life and legacy A Maronite Christian noted for his moderate views, Moawad had given some citizens hope that the long civil war in Lebanon could be ended. He was an example of non-violence and accepting the other in the Arab world, his culture of non-confrontation and troubleshooting conflict and his courage led all of the Lebanese parties to accept him as a president to end the war. Before he died, Moawad had addressed the nation with these words: \\"There can be no country or dignity without unity of the people, and there can be no unity without agreement, and there can be no agreement without conciliation, and there can be no conciliation without forgiveness and compromise.\\" He was succeeded by Elias Hrawi. As the son of Anis Bey Mouawad,Anis Mouawad on Ehden Family Tree website who had been mayor of the municipality, and his wife Evelyn Shalhoub, Moawad was the scion of a prominent Zgharta family, but he was the first member of the family to represent the constituency in Parliament. In 1965, Moawad married Nayla Moawad,Nayla Mouawad on Ehden Family Tree website a relative of Moawad's old political opponent Bechara El Khoury. Despite the historical animosity between their two families, as well as the fact that she was fifteen years his junior, the marriage was evidently a happy one. Their daughter Rima MoawadRima Mouawad on Ehden Family Tree website is now a lawyer and a graduate of Harvard University in the United States, while their son Michel MoawadMichel Mouawad on Ehden Family Tree website is a lawyer and businessman who graduated from Sorbonne University in Paris. Moawad's widow Nayla founded the Ren√© Moawad Foundation, to further the goals of dialogue, peace, and social justice, to which he had dedicated his life. Nayla Moawad was elected to the National Assembly in 1991. She was a member of the opposition Qornet Shehwan Gathering, which opposed the Syrian military presence in Lebanon. In 2004 she announced her candidacy for the Presidency to succeed √âmile Lahoud, whose term legally ended in November. Moawad's son, Michel, founded a new political party in 2006 called Independence Movement. The movement is part of the anti-Syrian Qornet Shehwan Gathering and the March 14 Alliance. In the 2005-2009 it had 3 Maronite Christian MPs for the Zgharta District in the Lebanese Parliament, Nayla Moawad, Jawad Simon BoulosJawad Boulos on Ehden Family Tree website and Samir Frangieh.Samir Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website Since 2009, the party has been led by Michel Ren√© Moawad, Jawad Simon Boulos and Youssef Bahaa El Douaihy.

One of the main differences is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs in which they have a single innings each. The former, known as first-class cricket if played at the senior level, has a scheduled duration of three to five days (there have been examples of \\"timeless\\" matches too); the latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 overs, has a planned duration of one day only. A separate form of limited overs is Twenty20, originally designed so that the whole game could be played in a single evening, in which each team has an innings limited to twenty overs. Double innings matches usually have at least six hours of playing time each day, with formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea, and additional brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings. Limited overs matches often last at least six hours, with similar intervals and breaks, whilst the more streamlined Twenty20 matches are generally completed in under four hours. T10 cricket is a newer version of the game, based on the principles of other limited overs formats, but with only 10 overs per innings, and the total playing time limited to 90 minutes. Local club cricket teams, which consist of amateur players, rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into * declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares * limited overs matches, in which a specified maximum number of overs is assigned for each team's innings individually. These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the 20-over format in the evenings. Indoor cricket is a variant of the sport played in sports halls during the winter months. At still lower levels, the rules are often changed simply to make the game playable with limited resources, or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants. Informal variants of the sport are played in areas as diverse as sandy beaches and ice floes. Professional cricket Four forms of cricket have been played at what may be termed the highest international or domestic level of the game. Three are contested currently and one is historic. There is no official term for this level of cricket collectively, although the individual forms do have official designations and are defined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In the past, before any official definition was agreed upon, highest standard matches were routinely described as \\"great\\" or \\"important\\" or \\"top-class\\"; or even \\"first-class\\" before this became the official term for one type of cricket (see below).ACS, First-class Match Guide, p. 4. Note that \\"minor cricket\\" is a term used officially in England and Wales at least. Matches played at the highest international and domestic levels are those in which players and/or teams of a recognized high standard are taking part. In modern domestic cricket, it includes first-class cricket, List A cricket and top-class Twenty20 competitions for both men and women. Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) are variations of those forms within the international sphere. Historically (see History of cricket), top-class matches were those held by substantial sources to have historical significance including single wicket and those double innings matches without statistical significance: i.e., lacking scorecards and other statistical data. The oldest known English county teams are Kent, Surrey and Sussex, all of which have histories commencing in the early 18th century. These counties had achieved a high standard long before their modern county clubs were founded (from 1839 to 1845), and so they have always had first-class status. Following a meeting in May 1894 of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the County Championship clubs, the concept of \\"first-class cricket\\" was officially defined.Birley, p. 145. By 1895, several other counties had also been recognized as having first-class status, as had MCC itself from its foundation in 1787. Top-class limited overs cricket began in 1963 when the County Championship clubs took part in the first seasonal knockout tournament, which was won by Sussex. Hence, like all the other first-class counties, Sussex for example is classified as a List A team from 1963; and as a top-class Twenty20 team since 2003. =First-class matches= First-class cricket is a form of the game in which teams of a recognized high standard compete. Test cricket is first-class at international level; the term \\"first-class\\" is habitually applied to domestic matches only, although a player's Test statistics are included in his overall first-class statistics. A first-class match must have eleven players per side, two innings apiece and a scheduled duration of at least three days. Historically, however, there have been instances of first-class matches being arranged for less than three days, and there have been others with twelve or thirteen players per side; these are exceptional cases and form a tiny percentage of the whole. If the game is not completed within the allotted time then it is drawn, regardless of who has scored the most runs when time expires. Limited overs matches in which the teams have only one innings each are not first-class (see List A and Twenty20 sections below) and these cannot result in a draw (they can, however, result in a tie or be declared a \\"no result\\"). Test matches, other games between two Test nations, games between two domestic teams deemed first-class in countries holding full membership of the ICC, and games between a Test nation's national side (or a team drawn from a national touring squad) and a first-class domestic team from a Test nation, are deemed to be first- class. A match between a leading ICC associate member and another team adjudged first-class would be granted first-class status, but domestic matches in the associate member country are minor. The origin of the term \\"first-class cricket\\" is unknown but, along with other terms, it was used loosely for top- class eleven-a-side matches before it acquired its official status in 1894 (see above). Subsequently, at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) in May 1947, it was formally defined on a global basis. A key omission of both the MCC and ICC rulings was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively and it was stipulated in the ICC ruling that the definition \\"will not have retrospective effect\\".Wisden 1948, p. 813. Many historians and statisticians have subjectively classified chosen pre-1895 matches as first- class but these are unofficial ratings and differences of opinion among the experts has led to variations in published cricket statistics. The main problem with \\"first-class cricket\\" is that it can be a misleading concept as it is essentially statistical and may typically ignore the historical aspect of a match if statistical information is missing, as is invariably the case with matches played up to 1825. Nevertheless, the recognition of any match as first-class by a substantial source qualifies it as such and it follows that the teams, venues and players involved in such matches before 1895 are the equivalent of first-class teams, venues and players since 1895. Substantial sources interested in 18th and 19th century cricket include Arthur Haygarth, F. S. Ashley-Cooper, H. T. Waghorn, G. B. Buckley, H. S. Altham, Roy Webber, John Arlott, Bill Frindall, the ACS and various internet sites (see Historical sources). Writing in 1951, Roy Webber drew a line between what is important historically and what should form part of the statistical record when he argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which overarm bowling was legalized) \\"cannot be regarded as (statistically) first- class\\" and their records are used \\"for their historical associations\\".Webber, pp. 9‚Äì10. =Limited overs cricket= Limited overs cricket played with 40 to 60 overs per team, known statistically as List A cricket, is a second form of cricket which differs from first-class as the teams play one innings each and are allowed a maximum number of overs per innings. Matches are scheduled for completion in a single day's play, though they can in theory continue into a second day if impacted by bad weather. Most cricketing nations have some form of domestic List A competition. The over limits range from forty to sixty. The categorization of \\"List A\\" was only endorsed by the ICC in 2006; the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians created it for the purpose of providing a parallel to first-class cricket in their record books. Twenty20 cricket Twenty20 is a separate form of limited overs cricket and is not part of List A. It is a third form of cricket originally devised in England in 2003. The teams have one innings each in which the maximum number of overs is twenty. Twenty20 competitions are held internationally and there are domestic championships in all the main cricketing nations. The Indian Premier League is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during April and May of every year by franchise teams representing Indian cities. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues. T10 cricket T10 format is a limited-overs evolution of cricket, following the success of the T20 game, with play limited to just 10 overs per team. It was first played from 14 to 17 December 2017 at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, approved by the Emirates Cricket Board in a professional cricket league owned and launched by T10 Sports Management. Each team has one innings of 10 overs, also time-limited to 90 minutes. The league is played in a round robin format that is followed by the semifinals and the final. If there is a tie, the result is decided by means of a Super Over. In August 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) officially sanctioned the second season of T10 to be held in Sharjah starting on 23 November that year,https://www.mykhel.com/cricket/t10-league-gets- international-cricket-council-icc-sanction-096030.html with six teams competing. =Three team cricket= Three team cricket, branded as 3TeamCricket (3TC), is an experimental format that was devised by Paul Harris, former CEO of FirstRand Bank, and launched as a joint-enterprise involving South African rugby union player Francois Pienaar and cricket commentator Mark Nicholas. A 3TC match is contested between 3 teams of 8 players each and played over 36 overs in two halves of 18 overs with a break at halftime. Teams bat for one innings of 12 overs, split between two 6-over periods, facing one opponent in the first half and the other opponent in the second half. After the fall of the 7th wicket, the last batsman stands alone but can only score in even numbers of runs. If the 7th wicket falls in the first half, the team forfeits the remaining part of that half and the last batsman resumes the innings in the second half. Each bowling team has the use of one new ball for their full 12 overs which is used for both opponents. A maximum of three overs per bowler is allowed. An uncompleted over due to the fall of the 7th wicket is deemed to be completed with dot balls. Most runs wins Gold, second Silver and third Bronze. If 2 teams tie with most runs, super overs decide Gold; if all 3 teams tie, all get Gold; and, in a tie for second, Silver is shared. On 18 July 2020, the 3TC Solidarity Cup became the first 3TeamCricket match to be played. Held in South Africa as a charity exhibition match, it marked the return to cricket in the country after a hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Amateur cricket There are numerous forms of cricket which, although they are not played professionally or at a recognized high standard, are still popular as common formats of amateur cricket. The double innings, limited overs, Twenty20 and single wicket forms are played by amateur teams: for example, Grade cricket in Australia and the Minor Counties Cricket Championship in England and Wales play the double innings form. =Club cricket= Club cricket, by far and away the widest form of cricket played worldwide, is largely amateur, but still formal, cricket, with the teams organised into leagues. The games are sometimes limited-overs, with each innings usually lasting between twenty and fifty overs. Other matches are played to time restrictions. Restrictions in overs or time may be placed on each side individually, or they may stipulate the total length of the match. The latter more traditional case is often known as declaration cricket. Club cricket is played extensively in cricketing nations, and also by immigrants from cricketing nations. Club cricket most often takes place on a natural grass wicket, often maintained by the players themselves, although at a lower level it may take place on an artificial turf pitch, though the rest of actual field will be natural grass. =Traditional forms of cricket= Declaration cricket This is the most traditional version of cricket, with rules most closely replicating the original rules of cricket from the 16th and 17th century. It is a single innings game with a set time limit for the entire game to be completed in. To win the game, a side must both score the highest aggregate number of runs and take all ten of the opposition wickets. It is up to the side batting first to declare when they feel they have enough runs to be able to win the match. In this format of cricket, if the side batting second do not lose all ten of their wickets, the match is said to have ended in a draw. Declaration cricket is generally played over a single day, although two day games lasting an entire weekend are also common. This format is often seen as \\"old-fashioned\\" and is typically used for friendly matches rather than in organised league play. Single wicket A match in which, as the name implies, there is a single batsman at any time. It is probably the oldest form of cricket as, at its most basic level, it involves one player against another. Historically, its matches were top-class and it has known periods of huge popularity, especially in the mid-18th century when it was the most popular form of cricket thanks to its gambling associations, and in the first half of the 19th century. Matches can involve teams with a single player only but the lucrative 18th century games were mostly between teams of three to five players known as \\"threes\\", \\"fours\\" or \\"fives\\". Only those players designated as team members can bat or bowl but it is normal to have the full quota of fielders including a wicket-keeper. =Double wicket= Double-wicket or \\"pairs\\" cricket is a form of cricket with two teams of two players each which are pitched against each other for a limited number of overs. A player getting out in this form of cricket does not retire but continues to bat but is penalized a stipulated number of runs for each time he gets out. =Short format cricket= Cricket is also played in several different shortened forms, designed to pack as much action as possible into an hour or two, enabling them to be played as a single contest in an evening, or as a series of multiple contests between different teams that cover the entire day. Such forms have evolved since the 1980s, and take cricket an additional step beyond one-day cricket. Most forms will resemble twenty-twenty cricket in nature, although shorter formats with reduced numbers of players, typically 6-aside or 8-aside, are also common for tournament play. Kwik cricket It is a simplified, high-speed version of the game played on a small pitch with plastic equipment, aimed mainly at encouraging youngsters to take part. =Indoor cricket= Indoor cricket is a format of the game designed to be played in an indoor sports hall at times of the year when outdoor play is not possible. There are two recognized forms of indoor cricket. The traditional version played with a hard ball is popular in the UK. This format is played with six players per side and features modified rules designed specifically for indoor play. A soft ball version is played by junior cricketers in the UK and is also popular among adults in the Southern Hemisphere. =Informal amateur cricket= Backyard cricket, Beach cricket, Street cricket are all different names used to describe a wide range of related informal games. The rules are often ad hoc, and the laws of cricket, such as those involving leg before wicket, penalty runs, and others, are ignored or modified to suit both the setting and participants' preferences. In India and Pakistan, there is Gali cricket ('gali' in Hindi means 'street'. It is pronounced as 'gully' but should not be confused with the fielding position). Often, there are no teams, and each player plays for himself, and fields when he is not batting. Often, there is one wicket, and one bowling position, and no overs. If the batsman runs an odd number of runs, he is allowed to walk back to the wicket before the next ball is bowled. Garden cricket Informal cricket in the UK is often known as garden cricket and is played in gardens and recreation grounds around the country. Because of limited space in gardens and the potential damage to property, one particular version of garden cricket is unique in that there are no concept of runs as attacking shots are expressly forbidden, and instead the winning batsman is the one who can survive the longest number of deliveries. Typically this will be played with a tennis ball or other soft bouncy ball, and modified rules, such as one hand one bounce are often employed. The length of the wicket will typically be roughly 15 meters, and the non-bowling fielders will be encircled close round the bat looking for a catching chance. French cricket It is a game in which the ball is bowled at the legs of the batsman, with the batsman's legs forming the wicket. It is often played by children. A tennis ball is often used rather than the harder cricket ball. Much like beach cricket, the rules may vary wildly.  South American variants  Plaquita and Bete-ombro are two South American versions of cricket that are very similar. =Placa or plaquita= \\"La plaquita\\" ('The little plate') or \\"la placa\\" ('The plate') is an obscure variation, played in the streets of Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic between two couples, usually making use of broomsticks as bats, rubber or tennis balls, and old licence plates as wickets (with their ends twisted to make them stand up). The game is divided in alternate 3-out innings as in baseball. The first team to reach 100 or 200 runs wins. =Bete-ombro= A similar version is played on the streets of Brazil and is known as bete-ombro, bats or taco ('taco' being Portuguese for 'bat'). =Tennis-ball cricket= This type of cricket is popular in the South Asian sub-continent, USA and Canada. In this game a harder version of tennis ball is used. The number of overs in the game varies from 6 to 25 overs. Considering that the ball is not as hard as the professional cricket ball, the use of protective gear like gloves, pads and helmets is optional. As tennis ball cricket games are shorter when compared to the conventional version, it suits the US and Canadian lifestyle where one would see a large number of people participating. Where cricket pitches are not available, part of a baseball diamond is used as a pitch in most parts of USA and Canada. Tape-ball cricket This type of cricket is popular in Pakistan, Bangladesh and somewhat gaining popularity in other South Asian countries and Europe due to the export of the idea from Pakistan. Tape ball cricket has been a cricket culture in Pakistan since the 1980s. Pakistanis who have settled in the west have introduced this theme and have tape ball leagues throughout UK, USA, and Canada. In this game a tennis ball is covered with insulating tape. This results in a heavier ball. Fast bowlers can generate extra swing in both directions while finger spinners can produce turn. The game is usually a limited over match with 4‚Äì12 overs. In Karachi and Lahore regular tournaments are held. Night matches are common, especially during the month of Ramadan.http://centralasiaonline.com/en_GB/articles/caii/features/pakistan/sports/2012/08/17/feature-01 =Non-stop (continuous) cricket= Continuous cricket is a game involving one batsman, who upon hitting the ball, must run to a marker, which is square of the wicket. The bowler may bowl as soon as the ball is returned, regardless of whether or not the batsman is still running. The game can be played in teams, or as a group, where players rotate between fielding positions, batting and bowling. =Over-60s cricket= Founded in Australia, it is for those over 60 years of age, slightly modified from the standard. =Vigoro= It is a form of cricket that also resembles baseball, mainly played by women. =Unorthodox forms of cricket= Kilikiti Also known as Kirikiti, or Samoan Cricket, it is the national game of Samoa and is especially popular in New Zealand. The game is descended from the cricket brought to Samoa by British missionaries; teams of unlimited size follow rules opaque to outside observers in a game/dance/feast event that can last several days. Trobriand cricket It is a peculiar form of cricket played in the Trobriand Islands, in Papua New Guinea. Although cricket was introduced by the British as part of colonial agenda, it was adopted into local Trobriand culture and many modifications and cultural adaptations were made over the years. Some of these include: under-arm bowling; outs are celebrated with dances; the \\"home\\" team (the tribal community which organised a match) always wins; any number of players can take part in a match; players dress in traditional war costumes. =Table cricket= Table Cricket is an indoor version of the game designed primarily for physically challenged cricketers. Cricket simulations without a ball or pitch =Book cricket= Book cricket is played by school children in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It has several variants and is usually played by two players. The runs are scored by flipping a book open at random and counting as the number of runs scored the last digit of the page- number of the verso (the left-side or even-numbered page). 0 and sometimes 8 are assigned special rules: typically a wicket is lost when a person scores 0, and a No-ball run and an additional chance are assigned when a player scores 8. To give an example, if the batting side opened the book at page 26, then 6 runs would be scored. For the toss, both players open a page and the one who scores the higher number of runs wins. Another version of cricket appeared during the 1950s in the UK in the Eagle comic. A page was chosen and each letter or symbol was counted according to a formula. This produced a scorecard with the majority of innings around 150 to 300 scored at about 4 runs per over. =Calculator cricket= This form is played by school children who use scientific calculators for maths and science. A player starts by clearing the memory on their calculator. The player will then use the random number generator on their calculator to bring up a number between 0 and 1. The number of runs scored is the first digit after the decimal point (for example, if the random number generator provides 0.521, 5 runs are scored). Scoring is kept by using the memory addition function on the calculator, or by pen and paper. Scoring a 0 is considered out. The player who has the highest score wins. =Hand cricket= Hand cricket is played through gestures (called 'throws') similar to rock paper scissors. The total number of fingers extended equates to the equivalent number, with a thumb counting as 6. Throws are made simultaneously by both players, one designated as the batter and the other as the bowler. Runs scored according to the batter's throws until the bowler throws the same, in which case the batter is \\"out\\". It is played by school children in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. =Pencil cricket= A one-person game played with pencils marked by hand to function as 'long dice'. A Japanese variant of these for use in other games are called 'battle pencils'.Japanese Battle Pencils ‚Äì Boing Boing It may also simply be played with conventional dice. The aim is to generate scores and attribute them to imaginary players and teams by compiling a scorecard. The game has been marketed commercially featuring plastic or metal long dice (rollers) and playing rules. =Pub cricket= Also called car cricket. A travel game based on the names of public houses passed on the route. Runs are scored according to the number of legs, arms or other items featured in the pub name. The exact rules vary according to the participants.

The Book of Genesis records circumcision as part of the Abrahamic covenant with Yahweh (God). Circumcision was common, although not universal, among ancient Semitic people. Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BCE, lists the Colchians, Ethiopians, Phoenicians, and Syrians as circumcising cultures. In the aftermath of the conquests of Alexander the Great, however, Greek dislike of circumcision (they regarded a man as truly \\"naked\\" only if his prepuce was retracted) led to a decline in its incidence among many peoples that had previously practiced it. The writer of 1 Maccabees wrote that under the Seleucids, many Jewish men attempted to hide or reverse their circumcision so they could exercise in Greek gymnasia, where nudity was the norm. First Maccabees also relates that the Seleucids forbade the practice of brit milah (Jewish circumcision), and punished those who performed it, as well as the infants who underwent it, with death. According to ‚ÄúNational Hospital Discharge Survey‚Äù in United States, as of 2008, the rate of circumcision of infant boys in hospitals in United States was 55.9%.

It has been variously proposed that it began :as a religious sacrifice; :as a rite of passage marking a boy's entrance into adulthood; :as a form of sympathetic magic to ensure virility or fertility; :as a means of reducing sexual pleasure; :as an aid to hygiene where regular bathing was impractical; :as a means of marking those of higher social status; :as a means of humiliating enemies and slaves by symbolic castration; :as a means of differentiating a circumcising group from their non-circumcising neighbors; :as a means of discouraging masturbation or other socially proscribed sexual behaviors; :as a means of increasing a man's attractiveness to women; :as a demonstration of one's ability to endure pain; :as a male counterpart to menstruation or the breaking of the hymen; :to copy the rare natural occurrence of a missing foreskin of an important leader; :as a way to repel demonesses;Alphabet of Ben Sirah, Question #5 (23a‚Äìb) and/or :as a display of disgust of the smegma produced by the foreskin. Removing the foreskin can prevent or treat a medical condition known as phimosis. It has been suggested that the custom of circumcision gave advantages to tribes that practiced it and thus led to its spread. Darby describes these theories as \\"conflicting\\", and states that \\"the only point of agreement among proponents of the various theories is that promoting good health had nothing to do with it.\\" Immerman et al. suggest that circumcision causes lowered sexual arousal of pubescent males, and hypothesize that this was a competitive advantage to tribes practising circumcision, leading to its spread. Wilson suggests that circumcision reduces insemination efficiency, reducing a man's capacity for extra-pair fertilizations by impairing sperm competition. Thus, men who display this signal of sexual obedience may gain social benefits if married men are selected to offer social trust and investment preferentially to peers who are less threatening to their paternity. Freud believed that circumcision allows senior men to constrain the incestuous desires of their juniors, and mediates the tension inherent in the father-son relationship and generational succession. Youth are symbolically castrated, or feminized, but also blessed with masculine fruitfulness. It is possible that circumcision arose independently in different cultures for different reasons. Africa \\"The distribution of circumcision and initiation rites throughout Africa, and the frequent resemblance between details of ceremonial procedure in areas thousands of miles apart, indicate that the circumcision ritual has an old tradition behind it and in its present form is the result of a long process of development.\\"Wagner, G. (1949). The Bantu of North Kavirondo. London: International African Institute. African cultural history is conveniently spoken of in terms of language group. The Niger‚ÄìCongo speakers of today extend from Senegal to Kenya to South Africa and all points between. In the historic period, the Niger‚ÄìCongo speaking peoples predominantly have and have had circumcision that occurred in young warrior initiation schools, the schools of Senegal and Gambia being not so very different from those of the Kenyan Gikuyu and South African Zulu. Their common ancestor was a horticultural group five, perhaps seven, thousand years ago from an area of the Cross River in modern Nigeria. From that area a horticultural frontier moved outward into West Africa and the Congo Basin. Certainly the warrior schools with circumcision were a part of the ancestral society's cultural repertoire. Circumcision in East Africa is a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood, but is only practiced in some nations (tribes). Some peoples in East Africa do not practice circumcision (for example the Luo of western Kenya). Amongst the Gikuyu (Kikuyu) people of Kenya and the Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania, circumcision has historically been the graduation element of an educational program that taught tribal beliefs, practices, culture, religion and history to youth who were on the verge of becoming full-fledged members of society. The circumcision ceremony was very public, and required a display of courage under the knife in order to maintain the honor and prestige of the young man and his family. The only form of anesthesia was a bath in the cold morning waters of a river, which tended to numb the senses to a minor degree. The youths being circumcised were required to maintain a stoic expression and not to flinch from the pain. After circumcision, young men became members of the warrior class, and were free to date and marry. The graduants became a fraternity that served together, and continued to have mutual obligation to each other for life. In the modern context in East Africa, the physical element of circumcision remains (in the societies that have historically practiced it) but without most of the other accompanying rites, context and programs. For many, the operation is now performed in private on one individual, in a hospital or doctor's office. Anesthesia is often used in such settings. There are tribes however, that do not accept this modernized practice. They insist on circumcision in a group ceremony, and a test of courage at the banks of a river. This more traditional approach is common amongst the Meru and the Kisii tribes of Kenya. Despite the loss of the rites and ceremonies that accompanied circumcision in the past, the physical operation remains crucial to personal identity and pride, and acceptance in society. Uncircumcised men in these communities risk being \\"outed\\", and subjected to ridicule as \\"boys\\". There have been many cases of forced circumcision of men from such communities who are discovered to have escaped the ritual. In some South African ethnic groups, circumcision has roots in several belief systems, and is performed most of the time on teenage boys: > The young men in the eastern Cape belong to the Xhosa ethnic group for whom > circumcision is considered part of the passage into manhood. ... A law was > recently introduced requiring initiation schools to be licensed and only > allowing circumcisions to be performed on youths aged 18 and older. But > Eastern Cape provincial Health Department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo told > Reuters news agency that boys as young as 11 had died.

Ancient world Ancient Egyptian carved scene of circumcision, from the inner northern wall of the Temple of Khonspekhrod at the Precinct of Mut, Luxor, Egypt. Eighteenth dynasty, Amenhotep III, c. 1360 BCE. Sixth Dynasty (2345‚Äì2181 BCE) tomb artwork in Egypt has been thought to be the oldest documentary evidence of circumcision, the most ancient depiction being a bas- relief from the necropolis at Saqqara (c. 2400 BCE) with the inscriptions reading: \\"The ointment is to make it acceptable.\\" and \\"Hold him so that he does not fall\\". In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century BCE, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: \\"When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men ... there was none thereof who hit out, there was none thereof who was hit, and there was none thereof who scratched and there was none thereof who was scratched.\\" Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BCE, wrote that the Egyptians \\"practise circumcision for the sake of cleanliness, considering it better to be cleanly than comely.\\" David GollaherGollaher (2000) considered circumcision in ancient Egypt to be a mark of passage from childhood to adulthood. He mentions that the alteration of the body and ritual of circumcision were supposed to give access to ancient mysteries reserved solely for the initiated. (See also Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis 1.15) The content of those mysteries are unclear but are likely to be myths, prayers, and incantations central to Egyptian religion. The Egyptian Book of the Dead, for example, tells of the sun god Ra cutting himself, the blood creating two minor guardian deities. The Egyptologist Emmanuel vicomte de Roug√© interpreted this as an act of circumcision. Circumcisions were performed by priests in a public ceremony, using a stone blade. It is thought to have been more popular among the upper echelons of the society, although it was not universal and those lower down the social order are known to have had the procedure done. The Egyptian hieroglyph for \\"penis\\" depicts either a circumcised or an erect organ. Depiction of circumcision in left Circumcision was also adopted by some Semitic peoples living in or around Egypt. Herodotus reported that circumcision is only practiced by the Egyptians, Colchians, Ethiopians, Phoenicians, the 'Syrians of Palestine', and \\"the Syrians who dwell about the rivers Thermodon and Parthenius, as well as their neighbours the Macronians and Macrones\\". He also reports, however, that \\"the Phoenicians, when they come to have commerce with the Greeks, cease to follow the Egyptians in this custom, and allow their children to remain uncircumcised.\\" According to Genesis, God told Abraham to circumcise himself, his household and his slaves as an everlasting covenant in their flesh, see also Abrahamic Covenant. Those who were not circumcised were to be \\"cut off\\" from their people. Covenants in biblical times were often sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate. In Hebrew, kƒÅrat ber√Æt meaning to seal a covenant translates literally as \\"cut a covenant\\". It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the foreskin symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant. Moses might not have been circumcised; one of his sons was not, nor were some of his followers while traveling through the desert.. Moses's wife Zipporah circumcised their son when God threatened to kill Moses. =Hellenistic and Judaic culture= Circumcision of Abraham's son Isaac. Regensburg Pentateuch, Israel Museum, Jerusalem (c. 1300). According to Hodges, ancient Greek aesthetics of the human form considered circumcision a mutilation of a previously perfectly shaped organ. Greek artwork of the period portrayed penises as covered by the foreskin (sometimes in exquisite detail), except in the portrayal of satyrs, lechers, and barbarians. This dislike of the appearance of the circumcised penis led to a decline in the incidence of circumcision among many peoples that had previously practiced it throughout Hellenistic times. In Egypt, only the priestly caste retained circumcision, and by the 2nd century, the only circumcising groups in the Roman Empire were Jews, Jewish Christians, Egyptian priests, and the Nabatean Arabs. Circumcision was sufficiently rare among non-Jews that being circumcised was considered conclusive evidence of Judaism (or Early Christianity and others derogatorily called Judaizers) in Roman courts‚ÄîSuetonius in Domitian 12.2 described a court proceeding in which a ninety-year-old man was stripped naked before the court to determine whether he was evading the head tax placed on Jews and Judaizers. The Romans applied the term curtus (lit., \\"cut short\\") to circumcised men at least in poetic contexts, e.g. at Horace, Sermones i.9.70. Cultural pressures to circumcise operated throughout the Hellenistic world: when the Judean king John Hyrcanus conquered the Idumeans, he forced them to become circumcised and convert to Judaism, but their ancestors the Edomites had practiced circumcision in pre-Hellenistic times. Some Jews tried to hide their circumcision status, as told in 1 Maccabees. This was mainly for social and economic benefits and also so that they could exercise in gymnasiums and compete in sporting events. Techniques for restoring the appearance of an uncircumcised penis were known by the 2nd century BCE. In one such technique, a copper weight (called the Judeum pondum) was hung from the remnants of the circumcised foreskin until, in time, they became sufficiently stretched to cover the glans. The 1st-century writer Celsus described two surgical techniques for foreskin restoration in his medical treatise De Medicina. In one of these, the skin of the penile shaft was loosened by cutting in around the base of the glans. The skin was then stretched over the glans and allowed to heal, giving the appearance of an uncircumcised penis. This was possible because the Abrahamic covenant of circumcision defined in the Bible was a relatively minor circumcision; named milah, this involved cutting off the foreskin that extended beyond the glans. Jewish religious writers denounced such practices as abrogating the covenant of Abraham in 1 Maccabees and the Talmud. Later during the Talmudic period (500‚Äì625 CE) a third step, known as Metzitzah, began to be practiced. In this step the mohel would suck the blood from the circumcision wound with his mouth to remove what was believed to be bad excess blood. As it actually increases the likelihood of infections such as tuberculosis and venereal diseases, modern day mohels use a glass tube placed over the infant's penis for suction of the blood. In many Jewish ritual circumcisions this step of Metzitzah has been eliminated. First Maccabees tells us that the Seleucids forbade the practice of brit milah, and punished those who performed it ‚Äì as well as the infants who underwent it ‚Äì with death. The 1st-century Jewish author Philo Judaeus (20 BCE - 50 CE) defended Jewish circumcision on several grounds, including health, cleanliness and fertility. He also thought that circumcision should be done as early as possible as it would not be as likely to be done by someone's own free will. He claimed that the foreskin prevented semen from reaching the vagina and so should be done as a way to increase the nation's population. He also noted that circumcision should be performed as an effective means to reduce sexual pleasure: \\"The legislators thought good to dock the organ which ministers to such intercourse thus making circumcision the symbol of excision of excessive and superfluous pleasure.\\" There was also division in Pharisaic Judaism between Hillel the Elder and Shammai on the issue of circumcision of proselytes. The Jewish philosopher Maimonides (1135‚Äì1204) insisted that faith should be the only reason for circumcision. He recognised that it was \\"a very hard thing\\" to have done to oneself but that it was done to \\"quell all the impulses of matter\\" and \\"perfect what is defective morally.\\" Sages at the time had recognised that the foreskin heightened sexual pleasure. Maimonides reasoned that the bleeding and loss of protective covering rendered the penis weakened and in so doing had the effect of reducing a man's lustful thoughts and making sex less pleasurable. He also warned that it is \\"hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him.\\"The Guide of the Perplexed. Translated and with an Introduction and Notes by Shlomo Pines. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1963, Part III, ch. 49, p. 609. A 13th-century French disciple of Maimonides, Isaac ben Yediah claimed that circumcision was an effective way of reducing a woman's sexual desire. With a non-circumcised man, he said, she always orgasms first and so her sexual appetite is never fulfilled, but with a circumcised man she receives no pleasure and hardly ever orgasms \\"because of the great heat and fire burning in her.\\" Flavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities book 20, chapter 2 records the story of King Izates who having been persuaded by a Jewish merchant named Ananias to embrace the Jewish religion, decided to get circumcised so as to follow Jewish law. Despite being reticent for fear of reprisals from his non- Jewish subjects he was eventually persuaded to do it by a Galileean Jew named Eleazar on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it. Despite his mother Helen and Ananias's fear of the consequences, Josephus said that God looked after Izates and his reign was peaceful and blessed. =Decline in Christianity= Jesus was circumcised (according to the Gospel of Luke, depicted in this sculpture at the Cathedral of Chartres) early Christians soon dispensed with the ritual. The Council of Jerusalem in Acts of the Apostles 15 addressed the issue of whether circumcision was required of new converts to Christianity. Both Simon Peter and James the Just spoke against requiring circumcision in Gentile converts and the Council ruled that circumcision was not necessary. However, Acts 16 and many references in the Letters of Paul show that the practice was not immediately eliminated. Paul of Tarsus, who was said to be directly responsible for one man's circumcision in Acts 16:1‚Äì3 and who appeared to praise Jewish circumcision in Romans 3:2, said that circumcision didn't matter in 1 Corinthians 7:19 and then increasingly turned against the practice, accusing those who promoted circumcision of wanting to make a good showing in the flesh and boasting or glorying in the flesh in Galatians 6:11‚Äì13. In a later letter, Philippians 3:2, he is reported as warning Christians to beware the \\"mutilation\\" Strong's G2699. Circumcision was so closely associated with Jewish men that Jewish Christians were referred to as \\"those of the circumcision\\" (e.g. Colossians 3:20) or conversely Christians who were circumcised were referred to as Jewish Christians or Judaizers. These terms (circumcised/uncircumcised) are generally interpreted to mean Jews and Greeks, who were predominant; however, it is an oversimplification as 1st-century Iudaea Province also had some Jews who no longer circumcised, and some Greeks (called Proselytes or Judaizers) and others such as Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Arabs who did. According to the Gospel of Thomas saying 53, Jesus says: :\\"His disciples said to him, \\"is circumcision useful or not?\\" He said to them, \\"If it were useful, their father would produce children already circumcised from their mother. Rather, the true circumcision in spirit has become profitable in every respect.\\"\\" SV Parallels to Thomas 53 are found in Paul's Romans 2:29, Philippians 3:3, 1 Corinthians 7:19, Galatians 6:15, Colossians 2:11‚Äì12. In John's Gospel 7:23 Jesus is reported as giving this response to those who criticized him for healing on the Sabbath: :Now if a man can be circumcised on the sabbath so that the Law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me for making a man whole and complete on a sabbath? ( Jerusalem Bible) This passage has been seen as a comment on the Rabbinic belief that circumcision heals the penis (Jerusalem Bible, note to John 7:23) or as a criticism of circumcision. Europeans, with the exception of the Jews, did not practice circumcision. A rare exception occurred in Visigothic Spain, where during the armed campaign king Wamba ordered circumcision of everyone who committed atrocities against the civilian population. reprinted in As part of an attempted reconciliation of Coptic and Catholic practices, the Catholic Church condemned the observance of circumcision as a moral sin and ordered against its practice in the Council of Basel-Florence in 1442. According to UNAIDS, the papal bull of Union with The Copts issued during that council stated that circumcision was merely unnecessary for Christians; El-Hout and Khauli, however, regard it as condemnation of the procedure. In the 18th century, Edward Gibbon referred to circumcision as a \\"singular mutilation\\" practised only by Jews and Turks and as \\"a painful and often dangerous rite\\" ... (R. Darby), a review of In 1753 in London there was a proposal for Jewish emancipation. It was furiously opposed by the pamphleteers of the time, who spread the fear that Jewish emancipation meant universal circumcision. Men were urged to protect: :\\"the best of Your property\\" and guard their threatened foreskins(!). It was an extraordinary outpouring of popular beliefs about sex, fears about masculinity and misconceptions about Jews, but also a striking indication of how central to their sexual identity men considered their foreskins at that time. (R.Darby) These negative attitudes remained well into the 19th century. English explorer Sir Richard Burton observed that \\"Christendom practically holds circumcision in horror\\". Revival in the English-speaking world Although negative attitudes prevailed for much of the 19th century, this began to change in the latter part of the century, especially in the English-speaking world. This shift can be seen in the account on circumcision in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The ninth edition, published in 1876, discusses the practice as a religious rite among Jews, Muslims, the ancient Egyptians and tribal peoples in various parts of the world. The author of the entry rejected sanitary explanations of the procedure in favour of a religious one: \\"like other body mutilations ... [it is] of the nature of a representative sacrifice\\". (R. Darby) However, by 1910 the entry [in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica] had been turned on its head: \\"This surgical operation, which is commonly prescribed for purely medical reasons, is also an initiation or religious ceremony among Jews and Muslims\\". Now it was primarily a medical procedure and only after that a religious ritual. The entry explained that \\"in recent years the medical profession has been responsible for its considerable extension among other than Jewish children ... for reasons of health\\" (11th edition, Vol. 6). By 1929 the entry is much reduced in size and consists merely of a brief description of the operation, which is \\"done as a preventive measure in the infant\\" and \\"performed chiefly for purposes of cleanliness\\". Ironically, readers are then referred to the entries for \\"Mutilation\\" and \\"Deformation\\" for a discussion of circumcision in its religious context (14th edition, 1929, Vol. 5). (R. Darby) There were two related concerns that led to the widespread adoption of this surgical procedure at this time. The first was a growing belief within the medical community regarding the efficacy of circumcision in reducing the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis. The second was the notion that circumcision would lessen the urge towards masturbation, or \\"self abuse\\" as it was often called. The tradition of circumcision is said to have been practiced within the British Royal Family, with varying accounts regarding which monarch started it: either Queen Victoria on account of her rumored adherence to British Israelism and the notion she was a descendant of King David (or on the advice of her personal physician), or her grandfather King George. The German-born King George was also the Prince-Elector of Hanover, and rumors existed that the Prince electors were circumcised. This is highly dubious since there is no evidence that Victoria was a supporter of the British Israeli movement, and the links between the royal family and the ancient House of David were only first proposed by its followers in the 1870s, long after she bore her sons (there is also evidence lacking that her sons, particularly Edward, had circumcisions); there is also no indication that the prince electors (or George himself) were circumcised and that the king introduced it upon his arrival to Britain and his ascension to the throne in 1714. If members of the royal family were circumcised, the reason was due to their embrace of a custom popular amongst the upper-classes in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Prince Charles and his brothers are believed to have been circumcised (the former by a reputable rabbi and mohel), but the supposed tradition ended before the births of William and his brother Harry due to their mother Diana's objections. Speculations arose in the media that William's son George may have been circumcised following his birth in 2013, but this is also highly unlikely. =Medical concerns= Jonathan Hutchinson was the first prominent medical advocate for circumcision. The first medical doctor to advocate for the adoption of circumcision was the eminent English physician, Jonathan Hutchinson. In 1855, he published a study in which he compared the rate of contraction of venereal disease amongst the gentile and Jewish population of London. Although his manipulation and usage of the data has since been shown to have been flawed (the protection that Jews appear to have are more likely due to cultural factors), his study appeared to demonstrate that circumcised men were significantly less vulnerable to such disease. (A 2006 systematic review concluded that the evidence \\"strongly indicates that circumcised men are at lower risk of chancroid and syphilis.\\") Hutchinson was a notable leader in the campaign for medical circumcision for the next fifty years, publishing A plea for circumcison in the British Medical Journal (1890), where he contended that the foreskin \\"... constitutes a harbour for filth, and is a constant source of irritation. It conduces to masturbation, and adds to the difficulties of sexual continence. It increases the risk of syphilis in early life, and of cancer in the aged.\\"\\"A plea for circumcison\\", Archives of Surgery, Vol. II, 1890, p. 15; reprinted in British Medical Journal, 27 September 1890, p. 769. As can be seen, he was also a convert to the idea that circumcision would prevent masturbation, a great Victorian concern. In an 1893 article, On circumcision as a preventive of masturbation he wrote: \\"I am inclined to believe that [circumcision] may often accomplish much, both in breaking the habit [of masturbation] as an immediate result, and in diminishing the temptation to it subsequently.\\"\\"On circumcision as a preventive of masturbation\\", Archives of surgery, Vol. II, 1890, p. 267-9 Nathaniel Heckford, a paediatrician at the East London Hospital for Children, wrote Circumcision as a Remedial Measure in Certain Cases of Epilepsy, Chorea, etc. (1865), in which he argued that circumcision acted as an effective remedial measure in the prevention of certain cases of epilepsy and chorea. These increasingly common medical beliefs were even applied to females. The controversial obstetrical surgeon Isaac Baker Brown founded the London Surgical Home for Women in 1858, where he worked on advancing surgical procedures. In 1866, Baker Brown described the use of clitoridectomy, the removal of the clitoris, as a cure for several conditions, including epilepsy, catalepsy and mania, which he attributed to masturbation. In On the Curability of Certain Forms of Insanity, Epilepsy, Catalepsy, and Hysteria in Females, he gave a 70 per cent success rate using this treatment. However, during 1866, Baker Brown began to receive negative feedback from within the medical profession from doctors who opposed the use of clitoridectomies and questioned the validity of Baker Brown's claims of success. An article appeared in The Times in December, which was favourable towards Baker Brown's work but suggested that Baker Brown had treated women of unsound mind. He was also accused of performing clitoridectomies without the consent or knowledge of his patients or their families. In 1867 he was expelled from the Obstetrical Society of London for carrying out the operations without consent. Baker Brown's ideas were more accepted in the United States, where, from the 1860s, the operation was being used to cure hysteria, nymphomania, and in young girls what was called \\"rebellion\\" or \\"unfeminine aggression\\". Lewis Sayre, New York orthopedic surgeon, became a prominent advocate for circumcision in America. In 1870, he examined a five-year-old boy who was unable to straighten his legs, and whose condition had so far defied treatment. Upon noting that the boy's genitals were inflamed, Sayre hypothesized that chronic irritation of the boy's foreskin had paralyzed his knees via reflex neurosis. Sayre circumcised the boy, and within a few weeks, he recovered from his paralysis. After several additional incidents in which circumcision also appeared effective in treating paralyzed joints, Sayre began to promote circumcision as a powerful orthopedic remedy. Sayre's prominence within the medical profession allowed him to reach a wide audience. As more practitioners tried circumcision as a treatment for otherwise intractable medical conditions, sometimes achieving positive results, the list of ailments reputed to be treatable through circumcision grew. By the 1890s, hernia, bladder infections, kidney stones, insomnia, chronic indigestion, rheumatism, epilepsy, asthma, bedwetting, Bright's disease, erectile dysfunction, syphilis, insanity, and skin cancer had all been linked to the foreskin, and many physicians advocated universal circumcision as a preventive health measure. Specific medical arguments aside, several hypotheses have been raised in explaining the public's acceptance of infant circumcision as preventive medicine. The success of the germ theory of disease had not only enabled physicians to combat many of the postoperative complications of surgery, but had made the wider public deeply suspicious of dirt and bodily secretions. Accordingly, the smegma that collects under the foreskin was viewed as unhealthy, and circumcision readily accepted as good penile hygiene.* Secondly, moral sentiment of the day regarded masturbation as not only sinful, but also physically and mentally unhealthy, stimulating the foreskin to produce the host of maladies of which it was suspected. In this climate, circumcision could be employed as a means of discouraging masturbation. All About the Baby, a popular parenting book of the 1890s, recommended infant circumcision for precisely this purpose. (However, a survey of 1410 men in the United States in 1992, Laumann found that circumcised men were more likely to report masturbating at least once a month.) As hospitals proliferated in urban areas, childbirth, at least among the upper and middle classes, was increasingly under the care of physicians in hospitals rather than with midwives in the home. It has been suggested that once a critical mass of infants were being circumcised in the hospital, circumcision became a class marker of those wealthy enough to afford a hospital birth. During the same time period, circumcision was becoming easier to perform. William Stewart Halsted's 1885 discovery of hypodermic cocaine as a local anaesthetic made it easier for doctors without expertise in the use of chloroform and other general anaesthetics to perform minor surgeries. Also, several mechanically aided circumcision techniques, forerunners of modern clamp-based circumcision methods, were first published in the medical literature of the 1890s, allowing surgeons to perform circumcisions more safely and successfully. By the 1920s, advances in the understanding of disease had undermined much of the original medical basis for preventive circumcision. Doctors continued to promote it, however, as good penile hygiene and as a preventive for a handful of conditions local to the penis: balanitis, phimosis, and penile cancer. =Masturbation concerns= A patented device designed to prevent masturbation by inflicting electric shocks upon the perpetrator, by ringing an alarm bell, and through spikes at the inner edge of the tube into which the penis is inserted. Circumcision was also recommended to prevent masturbation. Circumcision in English-speaking countries arose in a climate of negative attitudes towards sex, especially concerning masturbation. In her 1978 article The Ritual of Circumcision, Karen Erickson Paige writes: \\"The current medical rationale for circumcision developed after the operation was in wide practice. The original reason for the surgical removal of the foreskin, or prepuce, was to control 'masturbatory insanity' ‚Äì the range of mental disorders that people believed were caused by the 'polluting' practice of 'self-abuse.'\\" \\"Self-abuse\\" was a term commonly used to describe masturbation in the 19th century. According to Paige, \\"treatments ranged from diet, moral exhortations, hydrotherapy, and marriage, to such drastic measures as surgery, physical restraints, frights, and punishment. Some doctors recommended covering the penis with plaster of Paris, leather, or rubber; cauterization; making boys wear chastity belts or spiked rings; and in extreme cases, castration.\\" Paige details how circumcision became popular as a masturbation remedy: > In the 1890s, it became a popular technique to prevent, or cure, > masturbatory insanity. In 1891 the president of the Royal College of > Surgeons of England published On Circumcision as Preventive of Masturbation, > and two years later another British doctor wrote Circumcision: Its > Advantages and How to Perform It, which listed the reasons for removing the > \\"vestigial\\" prepuce. Evidently the foreskin could cause \\"nocturnal > incontinence,\\" hysteria, epilepsy, and irritation that might \\"give rise to > erotic stimulation and, consequently, masturbation.\\" Another physician, P.C. > Remondino, added that \\"circumcision is like a substantial and well-secured > life annuity ... it insures better health, greater capacity for labor, > longer life, less nervousness, sickness, loss of time, and less doctor > bills.\\" No wonder it became a popular remedy. At the same time circumcisions were advocated on men, clitoridectomies (removal of the clitoris) were also performed for the same reason (to treat female masturbators). The US \\"Orificial Surgery Society\\" for female \\"circumcision\\" operated until 1925, and clitoridectomies and infibulations would continue to be advocated by some through the 1930s. As late as 1936, L. E. Holt, an author of pediatric textbooks, advocated both circumcision and female genital mutilation as a treatment for masturbation. One of the leading advocates of circumcision was John Harvey Kellogg. He advocated the consumption of Kellogg's corn flakes to prevent masturbation, and he believed that circumcision would be an effective way to eliminate masturbation in males. > Covering the organs with a cage has been practiced with entire success.

Robert Darby (2003), writing in the Medical Journal of Australia, noted that some 19th-century circumcision advocates‚Äîand their opponents‚Äîbelieved that the foreskin was sexually sensitive: > In the 19th century the role of the foreskin in erotic sensation was well > understood by physicians who wanted to cut it off precisely because they > considered it the major factor leading boys to masturbation.

William Hammond, a Professor of Mind in New > York in the late 19th century, commented that \\"circumcision, when performed > in early life, generally lessens the voluptuous sensations of sexual > intercourse\\", and both he and Acton considered the foreskin necessary for > optimal sexual function, especially in old age. Jonathan Hutchinson, English > surgeon and pathologist (1828‚Äì1913), and many others, thought this was the > main reason why it should be excised. Born in the United Kingdom during the late-nineteenth century, John Maynard Keynes and his brother Geoffrey, were both circumcised in boyhood due to parents' concern about their masturbatory habits.R. Darby, A Surgical Temptation (2010) p. 298 Mainstream pediatric manuals continued to recommend circumcision as a deterrent against masturbation until the 1950s. =Spread and decline= Infant circumcision was taken up in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the English-speaking parts of Canada. Although it is difficult to determine historical circumcision rates, one estimate of infant circumcision rates in the United States holds that 30% of newborn American boys were being circumcised in 1900, 55% in 1925, and 72% in 1950. In South Korea, circumcision was largely unknown before the establishment of the United States trusteeship in 1945 and the spread of American influence.\\"Extraordinarily high rates of male circumcision in South Korea: history and underlying causes\\", BJU International, Volume 89: Pages 48-54, January 2002, archived at the Circumcision Reference Library More than 90% of South Korean high school boys are now circumcised at an average age of 12 years, which makes South Korea a unique case. However circumcision rates are now declining in South Korea. Decline in circumcision in the English- speaking world began in the postwar period. The British paediatrician Douglas Gairdner published a famous study in 1949, The fate of the foreskin, described as \\"a model of perceptive and pungent writing.\\" It revealed that for the years 1942‚Äì1947, about 16 children per year in England and Wales had died because of circumcision, a rate of about 1 per 6000 circumcisions. The article had an influential impact on medical practice and public opinion. In 1949, a lack of consensus in the medical community as to whether circumcision carried with it any notable health benefit motivated the United Kingdom's newly formed National Health Service to remove infant circumcision from its list of covered services. Since then, circumcision has been an out-of-pocket cost to parents, and the proportion of circumcised men is around 9%. Similar trends have operated in Canada, (where public medical insurance is universal, and where private insurance does not replicate services already paid from the public purse) individual provincial health insurance plans began delisting non- therapeutic circumcision in the 1980s. Manitoba was the final province to delist non-therapeutic circumcision, which occurred in 2005. The practice has also declined to about nine percent of newborn boys in Australia and is almost unknown in New Zealand.

He is now also a solo performer, while continuing to appear with various incarnations of Subway Sect. Biography Born Victor John Napper in Mortlake, south-west London, Godard was raised in nearby Barnes.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 75-6 In 1976, Godard formed Subway Sect with three other fans of the Sex Pistols at the suggestion of Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, who wanted another band for the line-up of the 100 Club Punk Festival. Despite their inexperience, Subway Sect made a successful debut at the festival and were taken on by Clash manager Bernie Rhodes. They appeared with The Clash on the White Riot Tour in 1977 and released their debut single, \\"Nobody's Scared\\"/\\"Don't Split It\\", in March 1978. While recording their debut album at Gooseberry Studios, Rhodes suddenly fired the entire band except for Godard. Two tracks from the album's recording sessions, \\"Ambition\\"/\\"Different Story\\", were released by Rough Trade Records; the single was a major hit on the alternative charts. Godard re-formed Subway Sect in 1980 with new musicians and signed to MCA Records sublabel Oddball, releasing the album What's The Matter Boy? Following a summer tour with Buzzcocks, Subway Sect disbanded again. Guitarist Johnny Britten formed a rockabilly band with Chris Bostock, Sean McLusky, Rob Marche and DC Collard, but was soon forced to leave the group, at which point Godard stepped in to take his place. They recorded the album Songs For Sale in 1981, but were disappointed with the results and disbanded soon after; members of the band, without Godard, went on to form JoBoxers. Godard also recorded an LP at Olympic Studios, called T.R.O.U.B.L.E., with a group of London jazz musicians known as Working Week, which was eventually released two years later by Rough Trade Records. In the mid-1980s, Godard retired from music and became a postman. In 1990, Godard wrote the song \\"Johnny Thunders\\", a tribute inspired by reading an obituary of the New York Dolls guitarist. It was recorded at the home of Paul Baker, a fellow postman. Godard also recorded ten other tracks and the recordings, with Paul Cook on drums, eventually became the album The End of the Surrey People. Produced by Edwyn Collins, it was released on the Postcard Records label. Collins' group Orange Juice had made the Subway Sect song \\"Holiday Hymn\\" a feature of their set in the early 1980s. Later in the 1990s, Godard formed the band The Long Decline with Kenny Wisdom and Mark Perry. The band released an album on the Overground label before disbanding in 1998, but re-formed in 2000 with Godard, Wisdom, Lee McFadden, and Mina Sassoon, among others. Godard contributed guitar and some songwriting, but not lead vocals, In 1998, Godard released the album Long Term side-Effect on Tugboat Records. A 2002 album recorded by Godard, Sansend, was released under the name Subway Sect, rather than his own. Godard's label Motion Records released Singles Anthology in 2005, compiling all the A-sides and B-sides from Godard's career. In 2007, as Subway Sect, Godard recorded the songs that had been intended for the debut LP back in 1978, and released them as 1978 Now. The line-up includes original drummer Mark Laff as well as original bass player Paul Myers on some tracks. Godard has also contributed to tracks by The Bitter Springs, who acted as his backing band (as Subway Sect) for nine years.McFadden, Lee (2006) \\"IN PROFILE: The Bitter Springs \\", The Morning Star, 7 January 2006 In 2009 Godard recorded We Come As Aliens for Overground records (with a vinyl edition on GNU Inc) with Subway Sect, as well as an EP with Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh called Blackpool. 2012 saw Godard & Subway Sect touring the UK & Europe extensively, while also recording 1979 Now with Edwyn Collins. 2013 included a collaborative tour with the Sexual Objects (featuring Davy Henderson of The Fire Engines) and two BBC sessions with Marc Riley. He released the 7\\" only single \\"Caught in Midstream\\" / \\"(You Bring Out) The Demon in Me\\". 2014 began with the release of 30 Odd Years a 45 track box-set on Godard's own GNU Inc records.

It does not intersect U.S. 12 now, but it once had an eastern terminus at U.S. 12 in St. Paul, Minnesota. It runs for 949 miles (1,527 km) from Minnesota Highway 62 at Edina, Minnesota to Yellowstone National Park. U.S. 212 passes through the states of Minnesota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. It goes through the cities of Watertown, South Dakota and Billings, Montana. Route description =Montana/Wyoming= U.S. 212 looking southeast into Wyoming from Montana The western terminus of Highway 212 is at the Montana/Wyoming state line within Yellowstone National Park. Within the park it is contiguous with Northeast Entrance Road, which has its western terminus on the Grand Loop within the Wyoming portion of the park. Highway 212 passes through Cooke City, Montana, then crosses the Wyoming state line and re-emerges into Montana approximately later. The section of Highway 212 between Cooke City and Red Lodge is known as the Beartooth Highway. Rising to an elevation of above sea level at Beartooth Pass, the highway traces the historical route of Civil War General Philip Sheridan over the Beartooth Mountains. In his book Dateline America published in 1979, the late CBS correspondent Charles Kuralt referred to the highway as \\"the most beautiful drive in America.\\" U.S. 212 looking west from Vista Point towards the Beartooth Mountains. Along this series of switchbacks, U.S. 212 climbs over to Beartooth Pass. Running northeast from the Beartooth Mountains, Highway 212 joins U.S. Route 310 before passing into the town of Laurel, Montana. Here Highway 212 joins Interstate 90 eastbound, while Highway 310 ends. Together, Highway 212 and I-90 run east through Billings, Montana to the town of Crow Agency, Montana between mile markers 434 and 510, a distance of . Within the Crow Indian Reservation, Highway 212 leaves I-90 and runs east and southeast through the high plains of Montana. It is the main east‚Äìwest road through the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. Southeast of Alzada, Montana, Highway 212 recrosses the Wyoming state line; after about , Highway 212 enters South Dakota.Google Maps estimate. For the entire length of Highway 212 in Montana between I-90 and the Wyoming state line, it is also known as the Warrior Trail Highway. =South Dakota= Highway 212 enters South Dakota near the junction of the Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota state lines, and continues southeast to Belle Fourche. Here it intersects with U.S Route 85, and then continues eastward, skirting the southern end of the Belle Fourche Reservoir. It continues east, passing the town of Nisland, until connecting with SD-79 south of Newell. It runs north into Newell, then turns generally east again, passing through the town of Faith and entering the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. It then passes through Dupree and North Eagle Butte, finally crossing the Missouri River. Continuing east, it then intersects (and is co-signed briefly) with U.S. Route 83 near Gettysburg, and then continues eastward, passing through Gettysburg, Seneca, and Faulkton. It intersects with SD-45, where it is cosigned for a brief southern leg, before turning eastward again and passing through Rockham, Zell and Redfield, where it intersects with U.S. Route 281. Continuing east, it passes through Clark, before entering Watertown, becoming 9th Avenue SW. Just east of Watertown, it intersects with Interstate 29, and continues east to the Minnesota state line.

The U.S. Highway runs from US 13 in Pocomoke City, Maryland north to Delaware Route 1 (DE 1) in Milford, Delaware. In conjunction with DE 1, US 113 is one of two major north‚Äìsouth highways on the Delmarva Peninsula (with US 13) that connect Dover with Pocomoke City and the Eastern Shore of Virginia. The U.S. Highway is the primary north‚Äìsouth highway in Worcester County, Maryland, where it connects Pocomoke City with Snow Hill and Berlin. US 113 is one of three major north‚Äìsouth highways in Sussex County, Delaware, where it connects Selbyville and Georgetown with Milford. While US 113 does not pass through Ocean City or the Delaware Beaches, the U.S. Highway intersects several highways that serve the Atlantic seaboard resorts, including US 50, Maryland Route 90 (MD 90), US 9, and DE 1\\\\. US 113 is a four-lane divided highway for its whole length except for between Snow Hill and Berlin, where it is a two-lane undivided road. US 113 follows the corridor of a post road established in the late 18th century to connect the aforementioned towns on the Delmarva Peninsula with Wilmington and Philadelphia. The highway was improved as an all-weather road in the 1910s. In Maryland, the post road was designated one of the original state roads established by the Maryland State Roads Commission (MDSRC) in 1909. In Delaware, the highway was the Selbyville‚ÄìDover portion of the DuPont Highway, a roadway whose construction was a grand philanthropic measure of Thomas Coleman DuPont. The DuPont Highway, which was started by DuPont's company and finished by the Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD), spurred economic growth in the tourism and agriculture sectors in southern Delaware. The economic growth resulted in heavy traffic; US 113 was widened in both states in the early 1930s and again in the late 1940s. Bypasses of Dover and Pocomoke City were built in the mid-1930s; the bypassed section of highway in Dover became US 113 Alternate. Expansion of US 113 to a divided highway began in the 1950s in Dover. Much of the remainder of the U.S. Highway in Delaware was expanded in the 1960s; the final section of two-lane US 113 in that state was expanded in the mid-1990s. The Berlin bypass became the first section of US 113 in Maryland to be expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1950s. In the early 1970s, US 113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was expanded to a divided highway and the Snow Hill bypass was constructed, replacing what would become US 113 Business. The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was expanded to a divided highway around 2000. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway. US 113's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE 1 from Milford to Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US 113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition. Route description US 113 serves as an important route carrying local and through traffic along with tourist traffic bound for the Delaware Beaches and Ocean City, Maryland to the east; as such the highway experiences congestion in the summer months when tourism to the beach areas is at its highest. Access from US 113 to the beach areas is provided by US 9 and DE 404 toward Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach; DE 26 toward Bethany Beach; DE 54 toward Fenwick Island; MD 90 toward northern Ocean City; US 50 toward downtown Ocean City; and MD 376 toward Assateague Island. US 113 also serves as a part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the beach communities to inland areas to the north. In 2016, US 113 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 38,505 vehicles at the US 9 intersection in Georgetown to a low of 6,070 vehicles between the southern terminus of US 113 Business and MD 12 in Snow Hill. All of US 113 is part of the National Highway System. =Maryland= US 113 has a length of in Maryland, where the route is named Worcester Highway. The highway extends the length of Worcester County and serves three of the county's four towns: Pocomoke City, Snow Hill, and Berlin. US 50 connects US 113 with the county's fourth town, Ocean City. Between Snow Hill and Berlin, the U.S. Highway is part of the Cape to Cape Scenic Byway, a Maryland Scenic Byway that comprises several highways in Worcester County. Pocomoke City to Snow Hill View south along US 113 at MD 756 near Pocomoke City US 113 begins at the city limit of Pocomoke City at an intersection with US 13 (Ocean Highway), the main highway of the Delmarva Peninsula that connects Wilmington and Dover with Salisbury and Norfolk. Old Virginia Road (unsigned MD 250A) continues west to US 13 Business (Market Street). US 13 Business heads north through the Pocomoke City Historic District, which preserves buildings from Pocomoke City's late 19th century and early 20th century heyday as a river port and station on the main rail line of the Delmarva Peninsula. US 113 heads northeast from US 13 as a four-lane divided highway and intersects American Legion Drive (unsigned MD 359B), which leads to MD 359 (Bypass Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Town Branch, a tributary of the Pocomoke River, and leaves the Pocomoke City area after intersecting MD 756 (Old Snow Hill Road). US 113 parallels the left bank of the Pocomoke River and crosses many streams that drain into the river, including Pilchard Creek, Bachelors Branch, Mataponi Creek, Corkers Creek, and Hardship Branch. US 113 passes through Pocomoke State Forest, which preserves loblolly pine stands and bald cypress swamps along the Maryland Scenic River; by the Pocomoke River Wildlife Management Area, in which dove hunting regularly occurs; and by the Shad Landing unit of Pocomoke River State Park, which offers boating, fishing, and a nature center. alt=One direction of a divided highway passing through a forest with a brown sign stating Pocomoke River State Park Shad Landing is the next right turn Northeast of the state park entrance, US 113 Business (Market Street) splits to the northeast to directly serve the town of Snow Hill, which is the county seat of Worcester County and contains several museums and colonial era buildings of the river port at the head of navigation of the Pocomoke River. US 113 bypasses the town to the south and east and intersects MD 12 (Snow Hill Road), which connects Snow Hill with Salisbury and Stockton, and MD 365 (Public Landing Road). The MD 365 junction is a superstreet intersection; MD 365 traffic must turn right, use U-turn ramps along US 113, and turn right again to continue on MD 365\\\\. North of MD 365, the highway reduces to a two-lane road and crosses Purnell Branch of the Pocomoke River. US 113 has a grade crossing with the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad and turns northeast again as the highway receives the other end of US 113 Business. Snow Hill to Berlin US 113 continues northeast, crosses Poorhouse Branch of the Pocomoke River, and passes Worcester Technical High School. North of its crossing of Five Mile Branch, the highway veers away from the Pocomoke River and enters the Atlantic seaboard watershed. , the highway enters a construction zone where the route is being expanded to a four-lane divided highway. US 113 parallels the rail line before it intersects the rail line at an oblique grade crossing at Newark Road and crosses Marshall Creek, which flows into Newport Bay. The highway passes to the south of the village of Newark, which contains the Queponco Railway Station, a preserved Pennsylvania Railroad station. US 113 expands to a four-lane divided highway at the north end of the construction zone between Langmaid Road and Massey Branch. The highway crosses Porter Creek and Goody Hill Branch of Bassett Creek and passes through Ironshire, which contains the Federal-style plantation home Simpson's Grove. US 113 crosses Poplartown Branch of Beaverdam Creek, passes the historic Italianate-style plantation home Merry Sherwood, and enters the town of Berlin at its southern junction with MD 818 (Main Street). MD 818 heads north through the Berlin Commercial District, which contains several museums and preserves buildings from the late 19th century when Berlin was at the intersection of two railroad lines. East of the town center, US 113 crosses Hudson Branch of Trappe Creek and intersects MD 376 (Bay Street) and MD 346 (Old Ocean City Boulevard). The U.S. Highway passes west of Atlantic General Hospital as it leaves the town of Berlin just south of its cloverleaf interchange with US 50 (Ocean Gateway), which connects Ocean City with Salisbury and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. North of the interchange, within which the highways cross Kitts Branch, US 113 meets the northern end of MD 818 as it begins to closely parallel the Snow Hill Line. Berlin to Selbyville alt=A divided highway curves to the left as the rightmost lane exits underneath an overhead green sign indicating the ramp leads to Worcester Highway and MD 589 toward Ocean Pines. US 113 closely parallels the railroad west of Friendship to north of its right-in/right-out junction with MD 575 (Worcester Highway), an interchange only accessible to the northbound U.S. Highway. The route leaves the railroad track and meets MD 90 (Ocean City Expressway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange; MD 90 connects the northern part of Ocean City with US 50 west of Berlin. US 113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD 575 and MD 589 (Racetrack Road), which leads to Ocean Pines and Ocean Downs, a harness racing track with a slot machine casino. The exit ramp from northbound US 113 intersects MD 575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589, and the southbound ramps connect with West Frontage Road (unsigned MD 575A), which serves St. Martin's Episcopal Church. US 113 continues through Showell, where the U.S. Highway crosses Church Branch, Middle Branch, and Birch Branch; these three streams together form Shingle Landing Prong of the St. Martin River, which empties into Isle of Wight Bay, a lagoon on the west side of Ocean City. Within Showell, the highway parallels Old US 113 (unsigned MD 575B), which is accessed at its south end with a right-in/right-out junction with southbound US 113 and full access via Shingle Landing Road. US 113 intersects MD 367 (Bishopville Road) at Bishop and has an oblique grade crossing with the rail line, then the route intersects the east end of MD 610 (Whaleyville Road). The U.S. Highway crosses Carey Branch, which flows into the Bishopville Prong of the St. Martin River, before it enters Delaware at the Transpeninsular Line, one of the lines surveyed as part of the 18th-century Penn‚ÄìCalvert boundary dispute. =Delaware= US 113 has a length of in Delaware, where the route is named DuPont Boulevard. The highway extends the length of Sussex County and into far southern Kent County. US 113 runs from Selbyville at the Maryland state line to Milford, a city that lies in both Sussex and Kent counties. Between those municipalities, US 113 serves the towns of Frankford, Dagsboro, Millsboro, Georgetown, and Ellendale. The U.S. Highway intersects several east‚Äìwest highways that connect US 113 with the Delaware beach towns to the east, including Lewes, Reboboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach, and Fenwick Island. The following includes a description of US 113's former course from Milford to Dover, most of which is now solely DE 1. Selbyville to Georgetown alt=A four-lane asphalt road with a grassy median surrounded by trees and homes. A ramp leads off to the road from the right with a yield sign. US 113 enters Sussex County to the east of the Great Cypress Swamp in the town of Selbyville, which was a center of strawberry production from the 19th century to the 1930s. The highway crosses Sandy Branch and intersects DE 54 (Cemetery Road/Cypress Road), which heads east to Fenwick Island. The U.S. Highway heads north parallel to the Maryland and Delaware Railroad to the town of Frankford, which was founded around a country store and the site of the Gothic Revival home of Captain Ebe Chandler. The highway crosses Vines Creek, the southernmost of several Indian River tributaries the route crosses, and passes along the western edge of the town. US 113 continues northwest parallel to the rail line, which north of Frankford is operated by the Delmarva Central Railroad as the Indian River Subdivision line. US 113 next comes to the town of Dagsboro, which is named for French and Indian War and American Revolutionary War general and major Sussex County landowner John Dagworthy. The highway crosses Pepper Creek and intersects DE 26 (Clayton Street/Nine Foot Road), which heads east to Bethany Beach, while it passes through the western fringe of the town. North of Dagsboro, US 113 crosses Whartons Branch before it intersects DE 20 (Dagsboro Road); the U.S. Highway and state highway run concurrently through the town of Millsboro, which was named for the cluster of mills around the head of navigation of the Indian River. The highways cross Iron Branch before they intersect DE 24 and DE 30 (Washington Street/Laurel Road) west of the town center. After crossing Betts Pond, DE 20 splits to the northwest as Hardscrabble Road as US 113 itself turns northwest toward the hamlet of Stockley. North of Stockley, US 113 intersects DE 24 Alternate (Speedway Road) adjacent to Georgetown Speedway and passes west of the Sussex Correctional Institution. US 113 enters the town of Georgetown, which was founded as a more central county seat for Sussex County in 1791, at its junction with South Bedford Street, which is marked US 9 Truck and DE 404 Truck. The truck routes, which bypass the downtown area of Georgetown, join US 113 to return to their respective mainline highways on the west side of downtown. US 9 Truck ends at the intersection with US 9 (County Seat Highway/Market Street) on the west side of Georgetown. Along with DE 404, US 9 heads east toward Delaware Coastal Airport, the original county seat of Lewes, the Cape May‚ÄìLewes Ferry, Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach. North of the center of town, US 113 intersects DE 404 and DE 18 (Seashore Highway), which head west toward Bridgeville and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The U.S. Highway meets North Bedford Street at the north town limit of Georgetown, where it passes east of a park and pool lot located at a church. Georgetown to Milford alt=A four-lane road with a grassy median surrounded by farms and woods US 113 continues northwest through Redden State Forest, whose loblolly pines occupy several disjoint tracts between Georgetown and Ellendale. The state forest originated as a Pennsylvania Railroad hunting preserve in the early 20th century, and the hunting lodge, forester's house, and stable is preserved and today used as the Redden Forest Education Center east of the hamlet of Redden. In this community, the road has an intersection with Redden Road. The U.S. Highway also passes near McColley's Chapel and crosses Gravelly Branch, one of the headwaters of the Nanticoke River, north of Redden. US 113 curves north and passes by the Ellendale State Forest Picnic Facility, a picnic area accessible from the northbound direction that the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed in the late 1930s for tourists and long-distance travelers. West of the town of Ellendale, which flourished in the late 19th century as a railroad town at the junction of perpendicular rail lines, the highway intersects DE 16 (Beach Highway/Milton Ellendale Highway) and passes Teddy's Tavern, which was built in 1923 as the Blue Hen Garage to serve travelers on the DuPont Highway. North of Ellendale, US 113 enters the Delaware Bay watershed; the highway crosses Cedar Creek to the west of Hudson Pond and passes to the west of the unincorporated community of Lincoln at the intersection with Fitzgeralds Road/Johnson Road. The highway continues through the city of Milford, which was founded in the early 19th century at the head of navigation of the Mispillion River whose antebellum buildings, late 19th- century buildings, and shipbuilding heritage are preserved, respectively, in the North Milford, South Milford and Milford Shipyard Area historic districts. US 113 intersects DE 36 (Shawnee Road/Lakeview Avenue) on the southwest side of town before crossing the river into Kent County between two of its impoundments, Silver Lake to the east and Haven Lake to the west. The highway has a grade crossing of the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision track and intersects DE 14 (Milford Harrington Highway/Northwest Front Street). On the north side of Milford, US 113 passes the historic Walnut Farm and heads east of a park and pool lot at a local business before it intersects DE 1 Business (North Walnut Street) obliquely. DE 1 Business joins US 113 in a short concurrency that ends when both the state business loop and the U.S. Highway reach their respective northern termini at a partial interchange with DE 1\\\\. There is no direct access from northbound US 113 to southbound DE 1 or from northbound DE 1 to southbound US 113. Former route from Milford to Dover Until 2003, US 113 continued north from Milford concurrently with DE 1 along four-lane divided Bay Road to Dover. Soon after US 113 joined DE 1, the roadway crossed Swan Creek to the east of Tub Mill Pond. The route headed north and intersected Thompsonville Road before crossing Old Baptist Church Branch. The U.S. Highway crossed the Murderkill River while passing to the east of the town of Frederica. At the north end of Frederica, the highway met the eastern end of DE 12 (Frederica Road). US 113 passed by historic Barratt's Chapel, the birthplace of Methodism in the United States. The highway met the southern end of US 113 Alternate (Clapham Road) at a Y intersection in the village of Little Heaven. US 113 crossed the St. Jones River on the Barkers Landing Bridge and curved northwest at its intersections with the southern end of DE 9 (Bayside Drive) and the western end of Kitts Hummock Road. The highway became a freeway along the edge of Dover Air Force Base. US 113 had a diamond interchange with Old Lebanon Road, which served the main gate of the air force base to the northeast and base housing to the southwest. At the next interchange, a partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of DE 10 (Lebanon Road) next to the military base's north gate, US 113 exited onto Bay Road while DE 1 continued on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway. The U.S. Highway had ramps from northbound US 113 to northbound DE 1, from southbound US 113 to southbound DE 1, and from southbound DE 1 to US 113 just south of its partial interchange with the Puncheon Run Connector freeway, which connected DE 1 and US 113 with US 13 on the south side of Dover. US 113 entered the city of Dover and passed between the DelDOT headquarters and the Blue Hen Corporate Center, which was transformed into a corporate center from the defunct Blue Hen Mall in 1995. The route intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west into the Dover Green Historic District and by the Delaware State Capitol, before reaching its northern terminus at a Y intersection with US 13 and the northern end of US 113 Alternate (DuPont Highway). History =Predecessor roads= The original highway along much of the US 113 corridor was a post road established in the late 18th century that connected Horn Town on the Eastern Shore of Virginia with Snow Hill, Berlin, Selbyville, Georgetown, Milford, and Dover, ultimately leading to Wilmington and Philadelphia.Milner, p. 4. The Dover‚ÄìMilford portion of the post road followed the King's Highway established in the late 17th century to connect Dover with Lewes, the original county seat of Sussex County. South of Milford, the post road followed a stage road from Dover to Dagsboro constructed to connect the new county seat of Georgetown with Dover in the 1790s. A 1796 act of the Delaware General Assembly called for surveying a straighter clear path in Sussex County from Milford through Georgetown and Dagsboro to the Maryland state line, a highway that became known as the State Road by the mid-19th century.Milner, p. 5. In Maryland, the post road followed what is now MD 12 from the Virginia state line through Stockton to Snow Hill and the Old Stage Road from north of Showell to the Delaware state line, and a separate road connected Pocomoke City and Snow Hill. By 1898, the dirt road from Pocomoke City to Berlin via Snow Hill was the main thoroughfare of Worcester County. With few exceptions, these roads remained rudimentary and were impassible in bad weather and a nuisance in good weather, which limited the economic possibilities of those regions of Delaware and Maryland. The Good Roads Movement in the 1890s and 1900s spurred investment and advocacy for constructing all-weather roads that connected the population centers of the states, although the instigating forces in each state were different.Milner, pp. 4, 5. State agencies in Maryland spearheaded the tasks of studying the issues and recommending increasingly effective courses of action. In Delaware, it was the philanthropic measure of a worldly man of one of Delaware's leading families that brought good roads to much of the state. Maryland state roads alt=A four-lane asphalt road with a grassy median approaching an interchange. A green overhead sign reads MD 90 east Ocean City 1/4 mile west Salisbury exit only. The Maryland Geological Survey was formed in 1896 to study the state's natural resources. Within two years, the agency determined that road building was an area that required extensive study and promotion, so the agency requested and received authorization from the Maryland General Assembly to create a Highway Division to study the state of highways in Maryland and propose engineering and legislative solutions to the state's transportation problems. One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 State Aid Highway Law, also known as the Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice and technical assistance from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of macadam roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US 113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long macadam roads that became US 113 with state aid: from the south town limit of Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town limit of Snow Hill to Purnells Mill Pond in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town limit of Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910. However, as in the remainder of the state, the State Aid Road Law was insufficient to form a statewide or even countywide network of all-weather roads, so in 1908 the General Assembly passed the State Road Law, which established the Maryland SRC to take over the state-aid support of the Maryland Geological Survey's Highway Division and construct, using state or state-contracted forces, a statewide system of roads to connect Baltimore and the state's county seats to each other. The system proposed in 1909 included the Pocomoke City-Snow Hill and Snow Hill-Berlin roads. Due to a lack of satisfactory contractor bids, the Maryland SRC contracted Worcester County forces to construct the state road between Snow Hill and Berlin. The county began constructing a macadam road between the ends of the state-aid sections in 1910. The section from Snow Hill to Newark was completed in 1911, and the remainder to Berlin was completed the following year. Construction on the Pocomoke City‚ÄìSnow Hill road was started from the Pocomoke City end in 1911. The first three sections were completed as macadam roads from Pocomoke City east to Outens Entrance in 1911, from Snow Hill west to Hardship Branch in 1912, and from Outens Entrance to Betheden Church in 1914. The final section, from Betheden Church to Hardship Branch, was constructed as a concrete road. The highway from the state-aid section on the north side of Berlin to Showell was constructed as a concrete road in 1917 and 1918. A concrete road was built north from Showell along a new alignment to tie in with the southern end of the DuPont Highway at Selbyville in 1921. By 1923, the town of Snow Hill resurfaced its Main Street and turned it over to the Maryland SRC, and Berlin gave its concrete Main Street to the state for maintenance, completing the highway from Pocomoke City to the Delaware state line. DuPont Highway alt=A four-lane concrete road with a grassy median surrounded by farms and woods The Delaware General Assembly approved a state-aid road law in 1903, but the law was repealed in 1905. Instead, the driving force for the construction of what became the Delaware portion of US 113 was Thomas Coleman DuPont, who offered to fund and construct a modern highway from Selbyville to Wilmington as a philanthropic measure. Inspired by the great boulevards of Europe and cognizant of the need for a main north‚Äìsouth highway as the backbone of a well-laid-out system of roads in Delaware, DuPont envisioned a right-of-way that contained a high-speed automobile highway flanked by dual trolley tracks, roadways for heavy vehicle traffic, unpaved roadways for horses above buried utility lines, and sidewalks at the outer edge of the right-of-way. The construction costs of the road would be recovered by trolley franchises and utility line rentals. After sections of the highway were built, they would be turned over without charge to the state, which would maintain the road.Milner, pp. 6, 8. Despite these grand visions, in the end the DuPont Highway was constructed in Sussex County as a wide concrete roadway on the proposed right- of-way.Milner, p. 13. The Delaware General Assembly passed the Boulevard Corporation Act of 1911, which authorized the formation of Coleman DuPont Road, Inc., to acquire land and construct a highway the length of the state. Construction of the first section of the highway began near Selbyville on September 18, 1911. By 1912, construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right-of- way. DuPont offered to make concessions, such as agreeing to pay up to five times the assessed value of a farmer's land five years after the road's completion and reducing the width of the corridor of land to be acquired to .Milner, p. 10. Construction on the highway resumed in 1915 after the litigation had taken its course. The first two sections of the highway, from Selbyville to Georgetown and from Georgetown to the Appenzellar farm south of Milford, were completed on May 24, 1917. The Delaware General Assembly created the DSHD in 1917 to lay out, construct, and maintain highways and to meet organizational requirements to receive federal aid through the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916. On July 20, 1918, DuPont reached an agreement with the state of Delaware for the newly formed DSHD to construct the remaining sections of the highway. DuPont would dissolve Coleman DuPont Road, Inc., and finance the remainder of construction up to , which is equivalent to in . The highway department would complete the road to Milford along the lines designed by DuPont's company. DSHD would both design and construct the DuPont Highway north of Milford; the department decided on a right-of-way for future sections of the highway. The portions from north of Ellendale to north of Milford, from Frederica to Little Heaven, and through Rising Sun were completed by 1920. All other portions of the DuPont Highway between Ellendale and Dover were under construction in 1920 and completed by 1923, the same year the last section of the entire Selbyville‚ÄìWilmington highway was completed near Odessa.Milner, p. 16. Despite DuPont's grand boulevard not coming to fruition, he was a visionary who implemented key practices before they became standard in the decades after he initiated his project. After his death in 1930, DuPont was recognized for foreseeing that traffic on highways would approach the speed and volume of railroads and planning with provisions for future needs. Based on that vision, he designed his highway with a wide right-of-way and curves and grades adequate for high-speed traffic. The DuPont Highway was also innovative as one of the earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but not directly through them, a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town's residents.Milner, p. 14. Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads. South of Milford, the DuPont Highway was constructed entirely on new alignment except from Bedford Street north of Georgetown to Old State Road at Redden. The portion of the highway north of Milford, which DSHD designed, mostly overlaid the existing Milford-Dover highway. The two exceptions were through Frederica, where the State Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road. =Widening and early bypasses= The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast. In conjunction with the rise of the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware Beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis. Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets. No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north.Milner, p. 28. However, the passenger and freight traffic induced by this increased economic integration and the automobile boom of the 1920s meant that these roads in Delaware and Maryland constructed in the 1910s and 1920s, which were built with widths of , were no longer adequate for the traffic they served.Milner, p. 26. In particular, by 1929 the Selbyville-Milford portion of the DuPont Highway was the only through highway in Delaware with a width of less than . The highway's importance was further implied when the Pocomoke City to Dover highway became part of the United States Numbered Highway System. The Pocomoke City‚ÄìDover route was designated Route No. 113 in the preliminary system proposed in November 1925, and that number and course were confirmed in the system AASHO and the Bureau of Public Roads approved in November 1926. The U.S. Highway's original southern terminus was the intersection of Market Street and Sixth Street in Pocomoke City. US 113's northern terminus was the split between the two main north-south highways of southern Delaware at Coopers Corner north of Puncheon Run on the southern edge of Dover. Interwar period widening and bypasses In Delaware, the DuPont Highway was widened to with the addition of concrete shoulders from Selbyville to Georgetown in 1930 and from Georgetown to Milford in 1931. In 1931, the highway department identified the need to expand the highway to from Milford to Dover, and this widening was completed in 1933. In 1930, Governors Avenue was reconstructed as a concrete road and extended to become the new route of US 13 through Dover. US 113 was then extended north along State Street to a new terminus at the junction of State Street and Governors Avenue on the south side of Silver Lake. In 1931, DSHD began construction on the first bypass of Dover. Much of the bypass would use Bay Road, the existing highway from modern DE 8 (North Little Creek Road) in Dover to Kitts Hummock on Delaware Bay. The Dover-Kitts Hummock road had been completed as a concrete road in 1926. Two sections of new highway were planned from DE 8 to State Street north of downtown Dover and from the DuPont Highway in Little Heaven north to Bay Road at what is now DE 1's interchange with DE 9 (Bayside Drive) at the southern end of Dover Air Force Base. The new highway between Little Heaven and Bay Road would cross the St. Jones River at a site called Barkers Landing. Between December 1931 and the end of 1933, DSHD constructed a causeway across of the marsh on the east bank of the river, a process that required multiple applications of fill dirt and dynamite to create a stable surface for a modern highway. A Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge with a clear opening was constructed across the St. Jones River in 1933 and 1934. Bay Road was widened and the new sections of highway were built with concrete pavement starting in 1934. The new highway was constructed with provisions for later being expanded to a divided highway. US 113 was relocated to the Dover Bypass, which was also known as the Eastern Boulevard, north to US 13 (State Street) when the new highway opened by the last weekend of May 1935. DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and Dover and State Street in Dover were designated US 113 Alternate. The first improvements to US 113 in Maryland were the widening of of the Snow Hill‚ÄìBerlin road with the addition of a pair of macadam shoulders in 1926. By the end of 1930, the widening of the Snow Hill‚ÄìBerlin road to was completed. State forces widened the Berlin‚ÄìDelaware state line road to around 1930; this work included a curve modification at the railroad crossing north of Berlin. Widening of the Pocomoke City‚ÄìSnow Hill road began in 1929. The first bypass along the route in Maryland was constructed to relieve congestion in Pocomoke City. The Public Works Administration, a New Deal federal program, partially funded the construction of a concrete road along what is now MD 250A and MD 359 in 1935 and 1936. The original route of US 113 was redesignated MD 756 by 1946. Post-World War II reconstruction As early as 1933, two years before US 13 had been completed as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US 13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred due to lack of funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as asphalt concrete or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface. alt=A four-lane divided highway surrounded by businesses and trees The first highway to be so treated was US 113 from Frederica to Little Heaven, which was resurfaced and widened to in 1941. DSHD included the highways between Dover and Milford and between Milford and Selbyville among those that should be reconstructed and resurfaced in the following four years, but that work was postponed due to the near-total cessation of highway construction projects during United States involvement in World War II. DSHD was able to resume this mode of highway reconstruction, which also included widening bridges and culverts, in 1944. This reconstruction plan returned to US 113 in 1946, when the highway between Ellendale and Georgetown was placed under reconstruction. The sections from Selbyville to Dagsboro, from Dagsboro to Georgetown, and from Milford to Little Heaven were expanded beginning in 1947. The post-war reconstruction and widening of US 113 to from Selbyville to the Dover Bypass in Little Heaven was completed with work on the U.S. Highway's Ellendale‚ÄìMilford segment in 1949.Milner, pp. 26, 28. In 1934, MDSRC had recommended widening the entirety of US 113 from to . Aside from the Pocomoke City Bypass, widening and reconstruction of the U.S. Highway in that state did not occur until after World War II. US 113 was widened and resurfaced from the north end of Berlin to the Delaware state line in 1947 and 1948 and from Pocomoke City to south of Snow Hill in 1948. The highway through Berlin was resurfaced in 1949. The U.S. route from the north end of Snow Hill to Newark was widened and resurfaced in 1951 and 1952. State forces reconstructed or widened seven bridges along the aforementioned widened sections in 1952 and 1953. US 113 through Snow Hill was reconstructed and widened in 1953 and 1954. The final two pieces of US 113 to be reconstructed were through Newark and Ironshire to the southern end of Berlin between 1954 and 1956. Instead of widening the existing highway, the U.S. Highway was built on mostly new alignment, with the northern segment through Ironshire constructed as the first carriageway of a future divided highway. The County Commissioners of Worcester County agreed to accept for maintenance the bypassed highways, Newark Road and Shire Drive, from Maryland SRC in March 1957. =Divided highway expansion= In 1940, DSHD initiated traffic surveys and studies to inform plans to construct a four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US 13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US 113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US 13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US 113 to a divided highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the Dover-Delmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US 13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, only a small portion of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a divided highway. Delaware divided highways alt=A four- lane asphalt road in a wooded area with some farmland, with a sign that says North 113 The first section of US 113 to be expanded to a divided highway was part of the new US 13 bypass of Dover. The latter highway's new four-lane course, which included a new bridge across the St. Jones River, was constructed starting in 1950 and opened to traffic April 16, 1952. As part of the project, the portion of US 113 from State Street north of Silver Lake to the new US 13 highway was expanded to a divided highway, and both U.S. Highways were marked on the expanded highway from State Street to their split at the modern intersection of US 13 and Bay Road. DSHD may have removed US 113 markers from north of Bay Road as early as 1965, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the northern terminus of the U.S. Highway being retracted from the north end of State Street to where US 13 meets Bay Road at their spring 1974 meeting. In conjunction, AASHTO approved removing US 113 Alternate from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113's northern terminus. The first divided highway project on US 113 proper began in 1957. The U.S. Highway's second carriageway was completed from its junction with US 13 and South Little Creek Road to the southern end of Dover Air Force Base in 1959. The first segment of the original DuPont Highway south of Dover to be expanded to a divided highway was from Walnut Street at the north end of Milford to south of Frederica; the southbound roadway of the divided highway section was constructed between 1957 and 1959. The US 113 divided highway was extended around Milford when the southbound carriageway was built from Walnut Street south to near Lincoln between 1961 and 1963; the project included a pair of bridges over the east end of Haven Lake at the Kent-Sussex county line. The Frederica bypass was constructed as a four-lane divided highway between 1963 and 1965. US 113 was expanded to a divided highway from just north of the Maryland state line in Selbyville to DE 20 north of Dagsboro between 1965 and 1967. The highway's second carriageway was built from north of Dagsboro to Stockley between 1966 and 1968. US 113 was completed as a divided highway from Stockley to Bedford Street on the northern edge of Georgetown in 1969. US 113's partial interchange with the Milford Bypass opened in 1971. Berlin and Snow Hill bypasses and Pocomoke to Snow Hill expansion alt=Several cars pass through a signalized intersection viewed from behind planted shrubs. Small green signs on the traffic light pole masts indicate the roads are named Ocean Highway and Worcester Highway. The first divided highway project on US 113 in Maryland was the four-lane divided Berlin bypass, which was constructed between 1955 and 1957. A second carriageway was added to the existing highway from Hayes Landing Road to Main Street south of Berlin and for a short stretch north of Main Street on the north side of Berlin. Main Street through Berlin became MD 818 in 1958. When US 50's bypass of Berlin was built between 1957 and 1959, ramps from westbound US 50 to northbound US 113 and from eastbound US 50 to southbound US 113 were added. The remaining six ramps of the cloverleaf interchange and US 113's bridges across US 50 were completed in 1975 and 1976. US 113's southern terminus was moved to its present intersection after US 13's bypass of Pocomoke City was completed in 1961; the segment of highway between US 13 and MD 675 (now US 13 Business) became an extension of MD 250A. The original Pocomoke City bypass from US 13 to MD 756 was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1969, the same year work began to establish a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Snow Hill. The second, northbound carriageway of the highway was constructed from east of Pilchard Creek to Blades Road between 1969 and 1971 and from Blades Road to the south end of the Snow Hill bypass in 1970 and 1971. US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from its US 13 intersection to east of Pilchard Creek, over which a new bridge was built for the northbound carriageway, starting in 1972. The now-bypassed 1936 Pocomoke City bypass was redesignated MD 359 after the completion of the new bypass in late 1974. The two-lane Snow Hill bypass was built as the southbound carriageway of an eventual divided highway from its south end to MD 12 in 1971 and 1972 and from MD 12 to north of Snow Hill between 1973 and 1975; the latter section included a three-span bridge across Purnell Branch. The bypassed portion of US 113 through Snow Hill became MD 394 in 1976. MD 394 was redesignated US 113 Business after AASHTO approved the new designation at its spring 1997 meeting. =Divided highway continuation= Expansion of US 113 to a divided highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway expansion projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed the completion of the divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state. Completion of divided highway in Delaware The Negative Declaration for the expansion of US 113 from the north end of the Frederica bypass to US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was issued in 1975, and construction began that same year. The Frederica-Little Heaven divided highway was completed in 1977. Design work for the divided highway from Little Heaven to Dover Air Force Base began as early as 1964, and considerable planning and design work was done before that work came to a halt in the 1970s. In addition to the environmental effects of the highway crossing a large marsh, which required DelDOT to produce a draft environmental impact statement, DelDOT needed to coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard to construct a new bridge across the St. Jones River. US 113 was finally expanded to a divided highway, including a four-lane bridge across the St. Jones River, by 1985. The final stretch of two-lane US 113 in Delaware was eliminated when the second carriageway was added to the highway from Bedford Street in Georgetown to north of Lincoln in 1995 and 1996. This expansion, in particular a section near Ellendale, was included in a Federal Highway Administration pavement study. Berlin to Selbyville expansion and relocation alt=A four-lane divided highway with brown guardrails in a rural area. On the right side of the road is a green sign that reads To Maryland Route 575 Showell right at signal. MDSHA conducted its first study on expanding US 113 north of Berlin to a divided highway in the early 1970s. Although US 113 was not expanded at that time, preparations for a future expansion were started, including acquisition of right of way along the proposed route. When MD 90 was built from US 50 to east of US 113 between 1973 and 1976, its interchange with the future course of US 113 was partially constructed. MDSHA conducted a second planning study in the late 1980s; in 1990, the agency decided to implement intersection improvements instead of constructing a divided highway. One particular improvement was reconstructing the highway immediately to the south of the Delaware state line to better tie into the divided highway in Delaware in 1989 and 1990. After the second study resulted in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US 113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US 113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US 113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US 113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway. US 113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware state line in three sections starting in 1998. The first section was constructed on a new alignment from north of MD 818 to south of MD 589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community. This segment, work on which included finishing the MD 90 interchange 24 years after it was partially constructed, was completed in 2000. The second segment of US 113 reconstruction, from south of MD 589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell. The second section, including the interchange with MD 589, was placed under construction in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line after the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road between 2001 and 2003. Sections of old alignment of US 113, service roads, and reconstructed connections with other highways were designated MD 575 starting in 2000. In November 2001, the National Partnership for Highway Quality awarded its Special Recognition of a Small Project Award to the Maryland Department of Transportation for the department's use of a modified design-bid-build contract approach to reduce the time needed to complete the first segment of the US 113 expansion north of Berlin. =Dover freeway, Milford truncation, and completion of Maryland divided highway= US 113's role between Milford and Dover became secondary with the designation and extension of DE 1 throughout the state in conjunction with the proposed US 13 Relief Route, which is now the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway from Dover Air Force Base to Christiana. DE 1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and concurrently with DE 14 along the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line at Fenwick Island in 1973. DE 1 was co-signed with DE 14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1976, when DE 14 was truncated at Milford. The DE 1 designation was extended north by 1988 along US 113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US 13 toward Christiana to connect sections of the Relief Route as they were completed. In 1991, DelDOT enacted corridor preservation measures on DE 1, including its concurrency with US 113, from Dover Air Force Base to Nassau to prevent excessive development along the corridor so it can gradually be transformed into a freeway. Dover freeway upgrade and truncation The southernmost part of the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, from south of DE 10 to north of Bay Road, was placed under construction in 1990 and opened along with the Dover-Smyrna portion of DE 1 in 1993. US 113 traffic needed to use a temporary tie-in during construction, and after the new freeway opened, traffic on the U.S. Highway needed to use Exit 95 to transfer between the new freeway and Bay Road. The extension of the DE 1 freeway south through Dover Air Force Base was constructed later due to the need to coordinate negotiations with the military installation and to allow the base to remediate hazardous material sites, maintain security and access restrictions with construction of a new Main Gate, and reconstruct base housing on the west side of the highway. The Main Gate to Dover Air Force base was moved further east, and a diamond interchange was built between the Main Gate and the base housing area. The upgrade of US 113 and DE 1 through the military base was built in two phases, the first from 1996 to 1998 and the second in 1999 and 2000. The final piece of the Relief Route associated with US 113 was the Puncheon Run Connector, which would provide a direct connection between US 13 and DE 1 and US 113\\\\. The connector and its partial interchange with US 113 were built between 1998 and 2000. In 2003, the same year the last portion of the Relief Route was completed, DelDOT requested US 113 be eliminated from Milford to Dover in favor of the sole designation of DE 1 from Milford to Dover. AASHTO denied DelDOT's application at their spring 2003 meeting because the state did not address the status of US 113 Alternate. The organization approved DelDOT's application to also eliminate US 113 Alternate in addition to the Milford- Dover portion of US 113 at their annual meeting later in 2003. Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US 113 at US 13 in Dover. Snow Hill to Berlin expansion alt=A two-lane road passing through farm fields. A blue and white sign on the right indicates an ongoing construction project on US 113\\\\. Following the expansion of US 113 from Berlin to the Delaware state line, MDSHA turned its attention toward the remaining of two-lane highway in Maryland between the southern end of the Snow Hill Bypass and the southern end of the existing divided highway at Hayes Landing Road south of Berlin. In 2005, MDSHA began construction on a five-phase, long-term project to expand US 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway to improve safety and service in the face of increasing seasonal traffic and development. Phase 1, which covered of the Snow Hill bypass from the southern terminus of US 113 Business to just north of MD 365, was completed in 2007. In 2015, MDSHA replaced the standard intersection between US 113 and MD 365 with a superstreet intersection. Phase 2 was divided into two sub-phases. Phase 2A, which covered the of US 113 from Goody Hill Road south of Ironshire to Hayes Landing Road, occurred from 2007 to 2009. Phase 2B, which covered the of highway between Massey Branch just north of Newark and Goody Hill Road, began in 2009 and was complete at the end of 2011. The service roads constructed during both parts of Phase 2 to restore access to properties cut off by the state establishing partial control of access on US 113 were designated segments of MD 921. Construction on Phase 3, which involves the of roadway between Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill and Massey Branch, began in fall 2015 and is expected to be finished in summer 2020. Phase 4 includes the section of US 113 between the northern end of Phase 1 near MD 365 north to the southern end of Phase 3 at Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill. Phase 4, which is expected to be constructed between 2017 and 2020, will complete US 113 as a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Milford. =Future upgrades= alt=A divided highway curves to the right. In the median are signs indicating the road is entering Delaware. Maryland and Delaware plan to continue to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project for the construction of an interchange between US 113 and MD 12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad. The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and Brick Kiln Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial control of access on US 113 between Pocomoke City and the south end of the Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass. In 2001, the DelDOT conducted a feasibility study for a future north‚Äìsouth limited access highway in Sussex County. The Sussex County North‚ÄìSouth Transportation Study explored routes along and between the US 13, US 113, and DE 1 corridors. The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; and the ability to build the limited-access highway in usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US 113 corridor, using as much of the current US 113 route as possible. For its standing US 113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboro‚ÄìSouth, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford. Ellendale and Georgetown planning complete Improvements in the Ellendale and Georgetown areas have been environmentally cleared, which means design and engineering can proceed as funding becomes available. The Federal Highway Administration approved the Ellendale Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2010. DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16\\\\. Along much of the route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway to provide access to properties along US 113 and to connect with the local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113\\\\. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16. The proposed interchange at DE 16 is in the design phase, with construction planned to begin in 2027. The Federal Highway Administration approved the Georgetown Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2014. As with the Ellendale area, DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 along its present alignment from south of Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro to south of Redden Road. Interchanges are planned near Piney Grove Road and Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro; at Governor Stockley Road at Stockley; near Speedway Road, Alms House Road, and Kruger Road north of Stockley; at Shortly Road and South Bedford Street on the southern edge of Georgetown; at Arrow Safety Road in Georgetown; at US 9 in Georgetown; at DE 18 and DE 404 in Georgetown; and at Wilson Road north of Georgetown. The U.S. Highway's intersection with DE 18 and DE 404 has the highest crash rate and the highest level of traffic congestion in the study area, so that intersection will be replaced with an interchange first. US 113 will be expanded to six lanes throughout the corridor, and right-in/right-out access to adjoining businesses would be maintained, with efforts to reduce the number of contact points. The interchange at DE 18 and DE 404 is currently in the design phase, with construction expected to begin in 2024. Millsboro‚ÄìSouth plan reduction and Milford suspension Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro‚ÄìSouth and Milford proposals faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro‚ÄìSouth area, DelDOT's preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was an eastern bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; pass to the east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113's present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro. US 113 would have had interchanges with DE 54 at its current junction, with DE 20 and DE 26 east of Dagsboro, with DE 24 east of Millsboro, with DE 30 north of Millsboro, and with DE 20 where the bypass rejoins the present course of US 113. However, DelDOT's preference faced opposition due to its cost, its land requirements, and a revelation that DelDOT was paying a pair of developers each month to not build on the path of the proposed bypass. In response to the payment scheme, Governor Jack Markell suspended further planning work on US 113 in Sussex County in January 2011. Markell indicated the project could resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the Millsboro-South area. In May 2011, Sussex County legislators proposed the U.S. Highway be upgraded fully along its current alignment, with the addition of a northeast bypass of Millsboro to connect US 113 and DE 24 that could be constructed mostly through state-owned land. Despite opposition to its preferred alternative, DelDOT completed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Millsboro‚ÄìSouth area in July 2013; the document recognized the significant opposition to the Blue Alternative. In 2015, DelDOT announced that the Blue Alternative was no longer being considered. Instead, US 113 would be upgraded along its current alignment as part of a Modified Yellow Alternative. However, unlike the original Yellow Alternative, which would upgrade US 113 to a freeway and featured several interchanges, US 113 would not become a freeway under the modified plan. Instead, only some crossroads would be eliminated, US 113 would be expanded to six lanes between its intersections with DE 20 on either side of Millsboro, and a two-lane northeast bypass of Millsboro proposed in 2011 would be built and connect with US 113 at a partial cloverleaf interchange near the northern US 113-DE 20 junction. In December 2016, DelDOT completed a Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement in which the Modified Yellow Alternative is the agency's preferred alternative. The Milford area study has been dormant since July 2007 due to community opposition to DelDOT's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford. After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes to the west and east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives in June 2007. Both alternatives head east from US 113's current alignment southwest of Lincoln, bypass the village to the south and east, have an interchange with DE 30 and Johnson Road, and meet DE 1 at an interchange south of the latter highway's interchange with the south end of DE 1 Business. On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department's advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75 percent for consensus to have been achieved. On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group, the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US 113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route. Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US 113 bypass of Milford in January 2008. Junction list - Special routes US 113 has had two special routes: an existing business route through Snow Hill and a former alternate route between Little Heaven and Dover. =Snow Hill business route= U.S. Route 113 Business (US 113 Business) is a business route of US 113 in Maryland. The route follows Market Street for between junctions with US 113 on the south and north sides of Snow Hill. The business route is part of the Cape to Cape Scenic Byway from its southern intersection with MD 12 to US 113 north of Snow Hill. US 113 Business follows the original course of US 113 through Snow Hill. The portions of the highway outside Snow Hill were paved by 1912, and the town portion was resurfaced and became a state highway by 1923. The Snow Hill bypass was completed in 1975, and the bypassed portion of US 113 through the town became Maryland Route 394 in 1976. MD 394 was redesignated US 113 Business after AASHTO approved the new designation at its spring 1997 meeting. View south at the north end of US 113 Bus. at US 113 in Snow Hill US 113 Business begins at an intersection with US 113 (Worcester Highway) south of Snow Hill. The business route heads northeast as two-lane Market Street into the town limits and to the downtown area. US 113 Business passes near the neoclassical home Chanceford and by the Julia A. Purnell Museum, which displays the history and memorability of Snow Hill, including the namesake's needlework. The route passes the Georgian-style Samuel Gunn House and All Hallows Episcopal Church, an example of 18th-century church vernacular architecture, on either side of its junction with MD 12 (Church Street). MD 12 joins US 113 Business for a short concurrency through downtown Snow Hill, during which the two highways pass the Worcester County Courthouse and Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church, an Isaac Pursell‚Äìdesigned High Victorian Gothic church honoring Francis Makemie, the founder of Presbyterianism in the United States. After MD 12 turns north onto Washington Street, the business route passes the Gothic Revival‚Äìstyle George Washington Purnell House and meets the west end of MD 365 (Bay Street) at the east end of downtown Snow Hill. US 113 Business crosses Purnell Branch, a tributary of the Pocomoke River, and leaves the town limits of Snow Hill just west of its northern terminus at US 113. Junction list =Former Little Heaven‚ÄìDover alternate route= U.S. Route 113 Alternate (US 113 Alternate) was an alternate route of US 113 that extended from US 113 and DE 1 in Little Heaven north to the intersection of US 13 and US 113 in Dover. US 113 Alternate followed the original path of the DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and US 13 in Dover. The DuPont Highway was paved through Rising Sun by 1920, and the entire length of the Selbyville‚ÄìWilmington highway was complete by 1923. When the U.S. Highway System was finalized in 1926, US 113's northern terminus was at Coopers Corner south of Dover, and US 13 followed State Street through the state capital. US 113 was extended north along State Street to the junction of State Street and Governors Avenue on the south side of Silver Lake after US 13 was placed on a reconstructed Governors Avenue in 1930. After US 113's bypass of Dover was completed in 1935, US 113 Alternate was established along US 113's former course from Little Heaven to Dover and along State Street and joined US 13 to cross Silver Lake to reach US 113's northern terminus at the intersection of DuPont Highway and State Street. The year after US 113 Alternate was assigned, State Street through Dover was reconstructed and widened and construction began on a new bridge for US 13 and US 113 Alternate across Silver Lake. The hazardous, narrow causeway was replaced with a four-lane, brick-lined, reinforced concrete triple-arch bridge, and State Street between the bridge and the beginning of the US 13 divided highway at US 113's northern terminus was widened to four lanes, in 1937. The intersection of US 113 and US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was reconstructed as a directional intersection in 1956. After US 13's bypass of Dover was completed in 1952, the northern termini of US 113 and US 113 Alternate remained north of Dover until 1974, when AASHTO approved moving the northern terminus of US 113 to the junction of US 13 and Bay Road. The organization also approved removing US 113 Alternate from State Street north of US 13 and instead following US 13 to US 113's northern terminus. US 113 Alternate was removed as an alternate route in conjunction with the elimination of US 113 between Milford and Dover after AASHTO approved the moves at the organization's 2003 annual meeting. The portions of US 113 Alternate that were not concurrent with US 13 or DE 10 Alternate became unnumbered. US 113 Alternate began at an intersection with US 113 and DE 1 (Bay Road) in Little Heaven. Connections from southbound US 113 Alternate to northbound US 113 and DE 1 and from southbound US 113 and DE 1 to northbound US 113 Alternate were provided by Mulberrie Point Road. The highway headed northwest as two-lane Clapham Road through the town of Magnolia, where the highway followed Main Street. There, US 113 Alternate intersected Walnut Street and passed by the late 18th-century Matthew Lowber House and the Queen Anne‚Äìstyle John B. Lindale House. The highway left Magnolia upon crossing Beaver Gut Ditch and continued northwest as South State Street, crossing Cypress Branch. The route came to the unincorporated village of Rising Sun, where it veered north and intersected DE 10 Alternate (Sorghum Mill Road). DE 10 Alternate joined US 113 Alternate in a concurrency north across Tidbury Creek to DE 10 Alternate's eastern terminus at their junction with DE 10 (Lebanon Road) in Highland Acres. US 113 Alternate continued north across Isaac Branch at Moores Lake and passed through Kent Acres before it entered the city of Dover just south of its underpass of the Puncheon Run Connector freeway and crossing of Puncheon Run. Just north of the stream and highway, the alternate route intersected US 13 (DuPont Highway). While South State Street continued north toward the Dover Green Historic District and the Delaware State Capitol, US 113 Alternate turned east to run concurrently with US 13. The two highways crossed the St. Jones River and intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west toward the state capitol and east to provide access to US 113 (Bay Road). Immediately to the north of Court Street, US 113 Alternate and US 113 reached their joint termini at US 13's directional intersection with Bay Road; US 13 continued north along DuPont Highway. There was no direct access between US 113 Alternate and US 113 at the terminal intersection.

Route description US 117 begins at the Port of Wilmington. Going east, it overlaps with NC 132 at College Street, then proceeds north. At the intersection of Kings Grant Road, I-40 begins; it has a brief concurrency before exiting off at exit 420. From this point, US 117 parallels I-40 on a mostly two-lane road, going through the towns of Burgaw, Wallace and Warsaw. At Calypso, it highway expands to 4-lane; this is also where a rare connector route is located going back to I-40. In Goldsboro, US 117 overlaps with US 13 and NC 581; it then splits from NC 581, which connects to I-795. With a brief concurrency with US 70, US 117 splits from both US 13 and US 70 to continue north towards Wilson. US 117 ends at US 301 in Wilson, near exits to both I-795 and US 264. History The second and current US 117 was established in 1932 as a renumbering of several routes in both South and North Carolina. In South Carolina, it replaced SC 38 from Conway to Myrtle Beach and SC 49 from Myrtle Beach to the state line. In North Carolina, it replaced SR 30 from the state line to Wilmington and US 17-1/SR 40 from Wilmington to Wilson. By 1939, US 17 replaced US 117 south of Wilmington. In the 1950s, bypasses were established in Burgaw and Goldsboro. In the early 1960s, US 117 bypassed Calypso to Mount Olive; which was later extended in 1988 to Brogden. In 2006, US 117 was moved onto a new freeway between Goldsboro and Wilson, its northern terminus ending at I-95. However, because of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act specifying that trucks over 48 feet (15 m) in length can utilize only Interstate and specific routes approved by the state, larger trucks were not legally allowed to use the new route. As a result, NCDOT decided to get it approved as an interstate as opposed to the longer process of adding it on the STAA system. AASHTO conditionally agreed to this on September 28, 2007, which gave birth to I-795 and moved US 117 back to its original route (briefly renumbered as US 117 Alternate), ending at US 301 near Wilson. Junction list Special routes =Burgaw alternate route= U.S. Route 117 Alternate (US 117A) was established in 1953 when mainline US 117 bypassed Burgaw to its east. It traveled through downtown Burgaw, via Walker Street, Bridges Street, and Timberly Lane. In 1960, the route was rebannered as a business loop. =Burgaw business loop= U.S. Route 117 Business (US 117 Bus) was established in the mid-1950s, the route that goes through downtown Burgaw, via Walker Street, Bridgers Street, and Timberly Lane. =Calypso Connector= U.S. Route 117 Connector (US 117 Conn) is a rare spur route connects I-40/NC 403 to US 117 in Calypso. What makes it unique is that this connector route is signed and traverses for several miles; it and US 19 Connector in Bryson City are the only confirmed signed connector routes in North Carolina. =Calypso‚ÄìMount Olive business loop= U.S. Route 117 Business (US 117 Bus) was established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 117A. It traveled along 4th Street in Calypso and Breazeale Avenue in Mount Olive. In 1988, the entire route was rebannered as an alternate route. =Calypso‚ÄìBrogden alternate route= U.S. Route 117 Alternate (US 117 Alt) was established in 1988, the alternate route followed the previous US 117 Business route between Calypso and Mount Olive to Vision of Faith Road, then continuing north replacing mainline US 117 when it was moved onto new freeway just west of it. =Goldsboro alternate route= U.S. Route 117 Alternate (US 117A) was established in 1952 when mainline US 117 bypassed Goldsboro to its west. It traveled through downtown Goldsboro, via George Street, Chestnut Street, Center Street, Ash Street, and William Street. In 1949, the US 117A was rerouted and replaced NC 102A on George Street, between Chestnut and Ash Streets. In 1960, the route was rebannered as a business loop. =Goldsboro business loop= U.S. Route 117 Business (US 117 Bus) was established in the mid-1950s, the route that goes through downtown Goldsboro via George Street, Ash Street, and William Street. =Goldsboro‚ÄìWilson alternate route= U.S. Route 117 Alternate (US 117 Alt) was established on September 2006 as a renumbering of mainline US 117 through Goldsboro, Pikeville, and Fremont, before connecting briefly with both US 301 and US 264 and the start of mainline US 117\\\\. On April 2009, nearly the entire alternate route was reverted to mainline US 117 when I-795 was established; overlapping sections of US 301 and US 264 were removed.

Although technically a spur of U.S. Route 18, US 218 neither begins nor ends at US 18, but overlaps US 18 for near Charles City, Iowa. US 218 begins at U.S. Route 136 in downtown Keokuk and ends away at Interstate 35 and U.S. Route 14 at Owatonna, Minnesota. A large portion of US 218 in Iowa is part of the Avenue of the Saints, which connects St. Louis, Missouri, and Saint Paul, Minnesota. Route description =Iowa= US 218 begins in downtown Keokuk at an intersection with US 136 and US 61 Business at Main and 7th Streets. The highway heads north along Main Street with US 61 Business. As they exit Keokuk, the business route ends at an intersection with the mainline US 61, which bypasses the city. US 218 and US 61 head north concurrently for a few miles before US 218 exits to the northwest; US 61 follows the Mississippi River north towards Fort Madison. US 218 travels northwest for almost along a two-lane road. As it approaches Donnellson, it meets up with and joins Iowa Highway 27 (Iowa 27), the Avenue of the Saints Highway. The two highways head north on a four-lane expressway. In Donnellson, they meet Iowa 2 at a diamond interchange. Further north, and east of Houghton, they intersect Iowa 16 at an at-grade intersection. Prior to crossing the Skunk River, the roadway angles to the northeast and a freeway bypass of Mount Pleasant begins. From the east, the highways are joined by US 34 and Iowa 163\\\\. The four highways loop around the city's eastern side and begin traversing the northern side when US 34 and Iowa 163 split away to continue bypassing Mount Pleasant; US 218 and Iowa 27 continue north. =Minnesota= U.S. 218 enters the state at Lyle, in Mower County. It follows along the east side of the Iowa, Chicago, and Eastern Railroad line as it continues northward through farm fields. Southeast of Austin, U.S. 218 angles northeastward to bypass the city, its former route following County Road 45 into town. U.S. 218 passes by the Austin Municipal Airport just before its interchange with Interstate 90. The highway runs concurrent with I-90 for nearly three miles through northern Austin. When U.S. 218 departs from the interstate and turns back north, it becomes a four-lane divided highway for a short distance. After its junction with State Highway 251, the highway angles north-northwestward again following the IC&E; rail line, this time on the west side of the tracks. The highway enters Dodge County for less than a mile, then reaches Steele County, Blooming Prairie, and an 8-block-long concurrency with State Highway 30. It continues north- northwest after leaving Blooming Prairie, traveling through predominantly agricultural scenery. It passes by Oak Glen Lake before going through the unincorporated community of Bixby. After passing through the unincorporated community of Pratt, U.S. 218 meets U.S. 14 at a folded diamond interchange. 218 runs westward concurrent with 14, while its historic route through downtown Owatonna continues ahead as County Road 48. After an interchange with County Road 45 (former U.S. 65), 218 and 14 pass by Kaplan's Woods Park and reach Interstate 35, where U.S. 218 ends. Legally, the Minnesota section of U.S. 218 is defined as Route 40 in Minnesota Statutes ¬ß 161.114(2).Minnesota Codified Laws History In 1913, work on the road that is now U.S. 218 was begun. At this time it was called the Red Ball Route. It was called this because the original route was marked with poles which had red balls, in diameter, mounted on each side. In 1920, the Minnesota portion of the route was designated as Constitutional Route 40, as part of the Babcock Amendment that established the Minnesota trunk highway system. In Iowa, U.S. 218 was extended from its previous southern terminus, at its intersection with U.S. 30 in Benton County, in 1934 when U.S. Highway 161 was split and renamed. The former U.S. 161 had extended from Dubuque, through Cedar Rapids, to Keokuk. After the split, the section of former U.S. 161 from Dubuque to Cedar Rapids extended U.S. 151 south, and the section of U.S. 30 from the former terminus of U.S. 218 to its intersection with the former U.S. 161 in Cedar Rapids, along with the section of former U.S. 161 from Cedar Rapids to Keokuk, extended U.S. 218 south. In 1965, U.S. 218 was rerouted along bypasses of Austin, Minnesota and Owatonna, Minnesota, the latter following a route that would later become the U.S. 14 bypass of that city as well. Highway 218 was featured in the Bellamy Brothers 1976 song \\"Highway 2-18 (Hang On To Your Dreams)\\". It was track A5 on their first album, Bellamy Brothers ‚Äì Featuring \\"Let Your Love Flow\\". Future The Iowa Department of Transportation has plans to rebuild the AOTS interchange with I-80 and I-380/US 218/Iowa 27 in Coralville. As the Eastern Iowa region has grown, traffic has increased, and the current arrangement of the interchange with its cloverleaf ramps has been deemed unsafe. The Iowa DOT proposes to rebuilt the interchange as a turbine interchange, which will eliminate weaving. The project is scheduled to begin in 2020. Major intersections Related routes =Mount Pleasant business route= U.S. Highway 218 Business (US 218 Business) was designated along a former routing of US 218 through Mount Pleasant, the northernmost are officially known as Iowa 438\\\\. The routing was created as a result of construction of the Avenue of the Saints corridor through Iowa. The new Avenue of the Saints corridor took US 218 / IA 27 and US 34 around the eastern and northern edges of Mount Pleasant. The Iowa 438 section of US 218 Business serves as a connector from southbound US 218 / Iowa 27 to westbound US 34\\\\. =Waverly business route= US 218 Business in Waverly was designated December 2, 1998, on the old segment of US 218 after it was routed around Waverly. The business route spans . It intersects Iowa 3 in downtown Waverly and the two routes run concurrently for about . South of Iowa 3, US 218 Business is officially known as Iowa Highway 116. US 218 Business begins at exit 198 of US 218 / IA 27 south of Waverly and ends at exit 205 of US 218 / IA 27\\\\. =Charles City business route= US 218 Business in Charles City was designated along the old alignment of US 218 in 2000 after the construction of the Avenue of the Saints corridor created a bypass around Charles City. Upon its designation, the route was officially known by two Iowa state highways ‚Äì Iowa Highway 337 and Iowa Highway 162. Iowa 337 was turned over to local jurisdictions in 2001 and Iowa 162 was turned over in 2006 after US 18 was relocated through Charles City.

A handle decomposition is to a manifold what a CW- decomposition is to a topological space‚Äîin many regards the purpose of a handle decomposition is to have a language analogous to CW-complexes, but adapted to the world of smooth manifolds. Thus an i-handle is the smooth analogue of an i-cell. Handle decompositions of manifolds arise naturally via Morse theory. The modification of handle structures is closely linked to Cerf theory. A 3-ball with three 1-handles attached. Motivation Consider the standard CW-decomposition of the n-sphere, with one zero cell and a single n-cell. From the point of view of smooth manifolds, this is a degenerate decomposition of the sphere, as there is no natural way to see the smooth structure of S^n from the eyes of this decomposition‚Äîin particular the smooth structure near the 0-cell depends on the behavior of the characteristic map \\\\chi : D^n \\\\to S^n in a neighbourhood of S^{n-1}. The problem with CW- decompositions is that the attaching maps for cells do not live in the world of smooth maps between manifolds. The germinal insight to correct this defect is the tubular neighbourhood theorem. Given a point p in a manifold M, its closed tubular neighbourhood N_p is diffeomorphic to D^m, thus we have decomposed M into the disjoint union of N_p and M \\\\setminus \\\\operatorname{int}(N_p) glued along their common boundary. The vital issue here is that the gluing map is a diffeomorphism. Similarly, take a smooth embedded arc in M \\\\setminus \\\\operatorname{int}(N_p), its tubular neighbourhood is diffeomorphic to I \\\\times D^{m-1}. This allows us to write M as the union of three manifolds, glued along parts of their boundaries: 1) D^m 2) I \\\\times D^{m-1} and 3) the complement of the open tubular neighbourhood of the arc in M \\\\setminus \\\\operatorname{int}(N_p). Notice all the gluing maps are smooth maps‚Äîin particular when we glue I \\\\times D^{m-1} to D^m the equivalence relation is generated by the embedding of (\\\\partial I)\\\\times D^{m-1} in \\\\partial D^m, which is smooth by the tubular neighbourhood theorem. Handle decompositions are an invention of Stephen Smale.S. Smale, \\"On the structure of manifolds\\" Amer. J. Math. , 84 (1962) pp. 387‚Äì399 In his original formulation, the process of attaching a j-handle to an m-manifold M assumes that one has a smooth embedding of f : S^{j-1} \\\\times D^{m-j} \\\\to \\\\partial M. Let H^j = D^j \\\\times D^{m-j}. The manifold M \\\\cup_f H^j (in words, M union a j-handle along f ) refers to the disjoint union of M and H^j with the identification of S^{j-1} \\\\times D^{m-j} with its image in \\\\partial M, i.e.: : M \\\\cup_f H^j = \\\\left( M \\\\sqcup (D^j \\\\times D^{m-j}) \\\\right) / \\\\sim where the equivalence relation \\\\sim is generated by (p,x) \\\\sim f(p,x) for all (p,x) \\\\in S^{j-1} \\\\times D^{m-j} \\\\subset D^j \\\\times D^{m-j}. One says a manifold N is obtained from M by attaching j-handles if the union of M with finitely many j-handles is diffeomorphic to N. The definition of a handle decomposition is then as in the introduction. Thus, a manifold has a handle decomposition with only 0-handles if it is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of balls. A connected manifold containing handles of only two types (i.e.: 0-handles and j-handles for some fixed j) is called a handlebody. Terminology When forming M union a j-handle H^j : M \\\\cup_f H^j = \\\\left( M \\\\sqcup (D^j \\\\times D^{m-j}) \\\\right) / \\\\sim f(S^{j-1} \\\\times \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}) \\\\subset M is known as the attaching sphere. f is sometimes called the framing of the attaching sphere, since it gives trivialization of its normal bundle. \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}^j \\\\times S^{m-j-1} \\\\subset D^j \\\\times D^{m-j} = H^j is the belt sphere of the handle H^j in M \\\\cup_f H^j. A manifold obtained by attaching g k-handles to the disc D^m is an (m,k)-handlebody of genus g . Cobordism presentations A handle presentation of a cobordism consists of a cobordism W where \\\\partial W = M_0 \\\\cup M_1 and an ascending union : W_{-1} \\\\subset W_0 \\\\subset W_1 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset W_{m+1} = W where M is m-dimensional, W is m+1-dimensional, W_{-1} is diffeomorphic to M_0 \\\\times [0,1] and W_i is obtained from W_{i-1} by the attachment of i-handles. Whereas handle decompositions are the analogue for manifolds what cell decompositions are to topological spaces, handle presentations of cobordisms are to manifolds with boundary what relative cell decompositions are for pairs of spaces. Morse theoretic viewpoint Given a Morse function f : M \\\\to \\\\mathbb R on a compact boundaryless manifold M, such that the critical points \\\\\\\\{p_1, \\\\ldots, p_k\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset M of f satisfy f(p_1) < f(p_2) < \\\\cdots < f(p_k) , and provided :t_0 < f(p_1) < t_1 < f(p_2) < \\\\cdots < t_{k-1} < f(p_k) < t_k , then for all j, f^{-1}[t_{j-1},t_{j}] is diffeomorphic to (f^{-1}(t_{j-1}) \\\\times [0,1]) \\\\cup H^{I(j)} where I(j) is the index of the critical point p_{j}. The index I(j) refers to the dimension of the maximal subspace of the tangent space T_{p_j}M where the Hessian is negative definite. Provided the indices satisfy I(1) \\\\leq I(2) \\\\leq \\\\cdots \\\\leq I(k) this is a handle decomposition of M, moreover, every manifold has such Morse functions, so they have handle decompositions. Similarly, given a cobordism W with \\\\partial W = M_0 \\\\cup M_1 and a function f: W \\\\to \\\\mathbb R which is Morse on the interior and constant on the boundary and satisfying the increasing index property, there is an induced handle presentation of the cobordism W. When f is a Morse function on M, -f is also a Morse function. The corresponding handle decomposition / presentation is called the dual decomposition. Some major theorems and observations * A Heegaard splitting of a closed, orientable 3-manifold is a decomposition of a 3-manifold into the union of two (3,1)-handlebodies along their common boundary, called the Heegaard splitting surface. Heegaard splittings arise for 3-manifolds in several natural ways: given a handle decomposition of a 3-manifold, the union of the 0 and 1-handles is a (3,1)-handlebody, and the union of the 3 and 2-handles is also a (3,1)-handlebody (from the point of view of the dual decomposition), thus a Heegaard splitting. If the 3-manifold has a triangulation T, there is an induced Heegaard splitting where the first (3,1)-handlebody is a regular neighbourhood of the 1-skeleton T^1, and the other (3,1)-handlebody is a regular neighbourhood of the dual 1-skeleton. * When attaching two handles in succession (M \\\\cup_f H^i) \\\\cup_g H^j, it is possible to switch the order of attachment, provided j \\\\leq i, i.e.: this manifold is diffeomorphic to a manifold of the form (M \\\\cup H^j) \\\\cup H^i for suitable attaching maps. * The boundary of M \\\\cup_f H^j is diffeomorphic to \\\\partial M surgered along the framed sphere f. This is the primary link between surgery, handles and Morse functions. * As a consequence, an m-manifold M is the boundary of an m+1-manifold W if and only if M can be obtained from S^m by surgery on a collection of framed links in S^m. For example, it's known that every 3-manifold bounds a 4-manifold (similarly oriented and spin 3-manifolds bound oriented and spin 4-manifolds respectively) due to Ren√© Thom's work on cobordism. Thus every 3-manifold can be obtained via surgery on framed links in the 3-sphere. In the oriented case, it's conventional to reduce this framed link to a framed embedding of a disjoint union of circles. * The H-cobordism theorem is proven by simplifying handle decompositions of smooth manifolds.

It is a north‚Äìsouth route (on a northeast-southwest alignment) that was an original United States highway of 1926. It is Corridor G of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) east of US 23 and KY 80 in Kentucky to Interstate 64 at Charleston, West Virginia. Route description = Kentucky= In Kentucky, US 119 is a two- and four-lane highway running from Pineville at U.S. Route 25E to the West Virginia state line at South Williamson. It follows the Cumberland River past Harlan to near the source of the river's Poor Fork, crosses Pine Mountain south of Whitesburg, then follows a meandering course along the mountain to Jenkins, where it joins US 23 and turns north to Pikeville. Just north of Pikeville it turns east to South Williamson, where it crosses the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River into Williamson, W.Va. From Pineville to US 23 (Country Music Highway) at Jenkins, it is part of ADHS Corridor F. In its concurrency from Jenkins north to Pikeville, where it heads east toward West Virginia, it is part of Corridor B. From US 23/KY 80 at Pikeville eastward towards the state line, it is part of Corridor G. =West Virginia= Spencer, West Virginia U.S. Route 119 enters West Virginia from Kentucky as unsigned AHDS Corridor G, a four-lane limited-access highway stretching from Williamson to Charleston. The earliest segment of Corridor G to open was in 1972 and was finished in 1997. Formerly, US 119 was a typical two-lane mountain highway. Old US 119 now comprises all or parts of US 52, WV 44, WV 10, WV 17, WV 85, WV 3, WV 94 and WV 61. The US route becomes a mostly two-lane highway north of Charleston, having functionally been replaced by Interstate 79. Compared to its replacement, US 119 takes a rather winding course. A trip from the Charleston area to the Morgantown area (I-79/US 119 Exit #1 to I-68 Exit #1) is via I-79 and via US 119. The travel time is about double taking US 119, over 4 hours instead of about 2 hours. From Charleston, US 119 heads roughly east along the Elk River to Clendenin, where it turns north for to Spencer. At Spencer, it begins to head east with US 33 for . Along the way, it passes through Glenville and Weston, where it intersects parent route US 19 and replacement I-79. From I-79 to WV 20 at Buckhannon, US 33/US 119 follow Corridor H. US 119 and US 52 north of Williamson. At Buckhannon, US 119 again turns north ‚Äî first with WV 20 then by itself as it travels to Philippi. At Philippi it joins with US 250 for . From there, US 119 heads on its own through Grafton and towards Morgantown. Just south of Morgantown, US 119 intersects Interstate 68's Exit #1, immediately east of its end at I-79. US 119 then enters downtown Morgantown, again meeting with US 19. It leaves town via the narrow and winding North Willey Street and congested Mileground. Just after the Mileground, US 119 intersects with the Monongalia County Route 857 connector to I-68 Exit #7, which effectively allows through traffic to bypass Morgantown. US 119 finally turns north to enter Pennsylvania near Point Marion. The Hamilton Farm Petroglyphs are along this section. Much of this last stretch of US 119 heading towards Uniontown, Pennsylvania is already bypassed by traffic using I-68, CR 857, and PA 857. While this alternate route is longer, it has a better alignment and is faster to travel. =Pennsylvania= US 119 travels through Connellsville, Greensburg, and Punxsutawney, and bypasses Uniontown and Indiana. There are numerous other boroughs and villages along its route in the Keystone State. The southern entrance of US 119 is at the West Virginia state line one-half mile south of Point Marion. The northern terminus is at US 219 two miles (3 km) south of DuBois, Pennsylvania. US 119's control cities include Morgantown, West Virginia, Uniontown, Connellsville, New Stanton (for northbound traffic only), Greensburg, Blairsville, Indiana, Punxsutawney, and DuBois. History = US 23 / US 123 = In 1929 U.S. Route 23, which then ended at Jenkins, KY, was extended to Pineville. The following year this section was renumbered to U.S. Route 123, to allow US 23 to be extended in a different direction (towards Kingsport TN). In 1934 US 119 was extended from Morgantown WV into Kentucky, joining US 123 at Jenkins; US 123 was then renumbered to US 119. = Kentucky= The Burning Fork interchange northeast of Pikeville, in 2005 when 119 was under construction. Hwy 119 in Kentucky was originally a series of two-lane roads paralleling Pine Mountain that connected Pineville to Baxter (just north of Harlan) and then headed northeast through Cumberland, Whitesburg, and Pikeville en route to West Virginia. Starting in the 1970s, there were a number of projects that widened or replaced sections of the road. In most places, the original route has been largely abandoned, instead cutting through the mountain to provide a much wider and straighter route. Small segments of the original route are still in existence as access roads to communities that predate the expansion. In Loyall the original route is known as Hwy 413, and this parallels Hwy 119 heading northeast until it reaches the community of Rosspoint. During this stretch in Baxter, Hwy 119 also briefly combines with U.S. Route 421, which then splits off and heads north across Pine Mountain. In Rosspoint, the original route of Hwy 119 is designated as Hwy 522. Hwy 522 parallels Hwy 119 all the way to Cumberland, where the final stretch of original highway is called Kingdom Come Dr. before merging with Hwy 119 just south of the Harlan County/Letcher County border. From this point until the base of Pine Mountain (unofficially called Whitesburg Mountain), the highway is largely unchanged from its original route. On the mountain, Hwy 119 has recently been widened in a number of places in order to make it safer for trucking traffic. Across the mountain in Whitesburg, Hwy 119 turns northeast. South of Jenkins, Hwy 119 merges with U.S. Route 23 until Pikeville, where it splits off and heads northeast to the West Virginia border. In 2007, a 6-mile stretch of Hwy 119 northeast of Pikeville, was expanded and improved by cutting through the mountain, once again abandoning the original route which is now known as the Zebulon Hwy. and Bent Branch Rd. Past this point, Hwy 119 follows its original route until exiting Kentucky at South Williamson. =West Virginia= The routing of US 119 south of Charleston changed drastically with the opening of Corridor G from 1972 to 1997. The original routing southeast of the capital was WV 61 to Marmet, where it took WV 94 southwest to Racine.Rand McNally. Atlas. 1970. From Racine to Danville, it followed today's WV 3 and onward to Madison. From Madison south to Logan, it followed today's WV 17\\\\. South of Logan to Mountain View, it followed WV 44\\\\. At Mountain View, it intersected US 52 and traveled concurrently with it to the northwest, to Williamson, where it entered Kentucky.  Corridor G  Corridor G is a highway in Kentucky and West Virginia. It is part of the Appalachian Development Highway System, encompassing US 119 for its length. At the southern terminus of Corridor G at Corridor B (US 23/US 460/KY 80) near Pikeville, Kentucky, traffic can continue along Corridor B towards Pikeville and Jenkins, where one can pick up Corridor F (US 119) or proceed south on Corridor B (US 23) into Virginia. At the northern terminus at Interstate 64 in Charleston, West Virginia, one can pick up Interstate 77 and Interstate 79, along with the West Virginia Turnpike. The Hatfield‚ÄìMcCoy Trails are an ATV and mountain biking network of trails throughout southwest West Virginia. Three trail heads branch off from various secondary routes accessible from Corridor G. = Kentucky = In 1974,Bridge stamp listings. Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. 2005. the first segment of Corridor G was completed from KY 292 (2nd St.) at South Williamson south to KY 199 at Huddy. This was a four-lane divided highway that contained mountable medians and jersey barriers, with a mix of state route and driveway access. This is especially evident as US 119 cuts through the center of Belfry and South Williamson. Several years later, a segment of four-lane US 119 along Buckley Creek opened from Corridor B/US 23/US 460/KY 80 north of Pikeville to what is now KY 1426 northeast of Pikeville. In 1997, a section of US 119 was relocated on new alignment from KY 3154 (Meathouse Fork Rd.) at Canada east to KY 199 at Huddy. Two years later, a section of US 119 was relocated on new alignment from east of Meta to KY 3154 at Canada. This involved extensive highwall construction at Bent Mountain and Canada Knob. The final segment of Corridor G in Kentucky to be completed was from the KY 1426 intersection north of Pikeville east to Scott Fork east of Meta. This segment required the construction of three twin steel-box girder bridges at Johns Creek (KY 194) near Bevins Branch, Winn Branch (Winn Branch Road), and Raccoon Creek (KY 1441).Jenior, Pete. \\"Notes on yesterday's Pikeville Meet and Trip.\\" Newsgroup posting. . This also includes a modified diamond interchange at what will be old US 119 1/2-mile east of KY 1426 at Zebulon. On June 30, 2006, the \\"Pinson Family Bridge\\" was dedicated. It crosses Raccoon Creek and KY 1441. This twin steel-box girder bridge is more than long and is the only example of its kind in Kentucky.Elkins, H.B. \\"New US 119 in Kentucky.\\" Newsgroup posting. . The girders were chosen because of the curvature within the bridge structure; each girder is completely hollow and it features a . clearance on the interior. On December 6, 2006, a segment of Corridor G opened from the KY 1426 intersection north of Pikeville east to the KY 194 (Johns Creek) interchange.\\"New sections of US 119 open this Wednesday.\\" Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. December 8, 2006 . The last segment to open is from KY 194 north to Scott Fork. That segment was opened in March 2008. = West Virginia = The first segments of Corridor G to open was in 1972.Release Date Report. West Virginia Department of Transportation. August 2003. During that year, a Mingo County segment from Myrtle and Belo (MP 13) to the Logan County line near Holden opened. Segments of this were opened originally as a \\"super-two\\" since WV 65 was being destroyed; it was critical that the old roadway be removed before the highway was expanded to four-lanes. Corridor G north of Logan, West Virginia. In 1973, a lengthy segment opened to traffic from Godby Heights south of Chapmanville (MP 13) to MP 4 in Boone County. This was followed a year later by a segment near Madison from MP 9.37 to MP 13 in Boone County. In 1975, the segment from MP 4 to MP 9.37 in Boone County was opened to traffic. At this time, the connection to Interstate 64 in Charleston also opened to traffic from Oakwood Road. This included the flyover ramp from US 119 to the Interstate 64 interchange. In 1977, a Mingo County segment from Nolan (MP 7.45) at US 52 to Myrtle (MP 13) opened to traffic. The next segment to open would come in 1982, when a Boone, Lincoln, and Kanawha County segment opened to traffic from Julian (MP 17) to the WV 601 interchange in South Charleston (MP 11). The segment between the WV 601 interchange to Oakwood Road in Charleston would be completed in 1986; it formerly utilized Oakhurst and Oakwood Roads. In 1989, a segment from MP 13 to Julian (MP 17) in Boone County opened. In 1992, a new Tug Fork crossing at Williamson was completed. Formerly, Corridor G traffic from Kentucky had to cross into downtown Williamson and pick up US 119 into West Virginia. The last segment of Corridor G in West Virginia to be completed was from the Tug Fork crossing at Williamson north to US 52 near Nolan. This nine-mile (14 km) segment was completed in 1997.

It runs for from West Seneca, New York at an interchange with Interstate 90, to Rich Creek, Virginia, intersecting at U.S. Route 460. U.S. 219 is found (from north to south) in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia. Much of the Route in West Virginia follows the old Indian warpath known as the Seneca Trail (Great Indian Warpath). Route description =Virginia= View north near the south end of US 219 at US 460 in Rich Creek U.S. Route 219 starts in Rich Creek at U.S. Route 460, and heads northeast to the West Virginia state line. Until the early 1980s, US 219 continued southwest with US 460 from Rich Creek, re-entering West Virginia to end at US 19 in Bluefield. It now only runs in Virginia. US 219 was initially added to the state highway system in the early 1920s as State Route 231. It became State Route 216 in the 1928 renumbering and State Route 124 in the 1933 renumbering, finally becoming part of the extended US 219 (along with State Route 8, now U.S. Route 460, west of Rich Creek) in the late 1930s. =West Virginia= Route 219 in Hillsboro US 219 enters West Virginia in Peterstown at the split of US 219 and WV 12. US 219 then heads northeast into Union. US 219 continues through Greenbrier County running through the towns of Ronceverte, Lewisburg, where it intersects US 60, and Falling Spring. US 219 continues north into Pocahontas County and through the towns of Hillsboro and Marlinton. US 219 runs north into Randolph County and begins its dual certification with US 250. They both serve the towns of Huttonsville, Mill Creek, Beverly, and Elkins, where US 33 joins the concurrency. US 219 splits from US 33 and US 250 just north of Elkins. US 219 continues through the town of Montrose until it enters Tucker County. From here, US 219 runs through the towns of Parsons and Thomas. US 219 heads north into rural Preston County and exits West Virginia into Garrett County, Maryland. =Maryland= US 219 enters Maryland near Backbone Mountain on the West Virginia border, crosses US 50 and enters the town of Oakland. It crosses Maryland Route 135 and Maryland Route 39 in Oakland, before passing Deep Creek Lake. After traveling through Accident it intersects Interstate 68 east of Friendsville, providing access to Morgantown, West Virginia, Frostburg and Cumberland. US 219 runs concurrently with I-68 at Exit 14A and exits I-68 at Exit 22. US 219 crosses the Mason‚ÄìDixon line, the Pennsylvania border, south of Salisbury, Pennsylvania. =Pennsylvania= Horton Township in Elk County From near Grantsville, Maryland north to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, US 219 is Corridor N of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From Somerset, Pennsylvania to just south of Carrolltown, Pennsylvania, US 219 is a limited- access highway. A new 11-mile limited-access segment from Meyersdale to Somerset opened to traffic in the late fall of 2018. On August 9, 2007, Pennsylvania State Transportation Secretary Allen D. Biehler unveiled four signs along US Route 219 that dedicated the route from Maryland to Cambria County, Pennsylvania as the \\"Flight 93 Memorial Highway\\". From Carrolltown US 219 runs largely as a two-lane road to DuBois, Pennsylvania, through which it runs as Brady Street, and then returns to a two-lane road after a junction with Interstate 80. US 219 runs directly through the towns of Brockway, Ridgway, and Johnsonburg before reaching Wilcox, where PA Route 321 splits and heads for the borough of Kane. US 219 continues north as a two-lane road until reaching Bradford, where it becomes a limited-access highway and remains so until reaching the New York border. =New York= US 219 enters Western New York from Pennsylvania south of the Hamlet of Limestone in the Town of Carrollton in Cattaraugus County. Proceeding northward, the highway splits into the main route and a \\"business route\\" that follows the original main route. The main route merges with Interstate 86/New York State Route 17 at Exit 23 north of Limestone and splits from I-86/NY 17 at Exit 21 in the city of Salamanca. The business route crosses the Allegheny River and the Southern Tier Expressway and joins New York State Route 417 to the City of Salamanca. Separating from NY 417, the business route rejoins with the main US 219 and turns northward through the rest of Cattaraugus County, passing through Peth, Great Valley, Ellicottville, and Ashford Hollow before crossing the Cattaraugus Creek and entering Erie County. About 4 miles south of Springville, New York, US 219 becomes a divided, limited-access highway. As such, it continues north through half of the county, terminating at exit 55 of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) near the west town line of West Seneca south of the City of Buffalo. Before joining the Thruway, US 219 runs parallel to it for about one mile (1.6 km). The interchange is set up as such that drivers can exit and re-enter the Thruway via US 219 without leaving the expressway. Continental 1 In February 2009, it was reported that a group known as the 219 Association was pursuing the goal of urging several states to transform US 219 into a divided highway which the group hoped would be referred to as Continental 1. It has been proposed that US 219 could spur trade between Canada, the U.S., and the Caribbean region.

It runs for from the foot of the John Gorrie Memorial Bridge across from downtown Apalachicola, Florida to US 1/SR 4 in Wadley, Georgia, through the Panhandle of Florida and the southern portion of Georgia. Route description A US 319 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 =Florida= John Gorrie Bridge in Apalachicola, FL The route starts as a two-lane highway at the eastern end of US 98's bridge over the Apalachicola River near the John Gorrie Bridge in Apalachicola, Florida, and is concurrent with US 98 from its starting point. After crossing the East Bay portion of Apalachicola Bay via the John Gorrie Bridge, US 319 runs along the Gulf coast of Florida's Panhandle to Carabelle in Franklin County, and departs the coast, and its concurrency with US 98, about halfway between Carrabelle and Bald Point State Park, in a north direction through Sopchoppy in Wakulla County. In Sopchoppy, the route angles east, briefly meets up with US 98 once more, before parting ways again and running north through Crawfordville, where it receives the FDOT maintenance designation of State Road 369, into Tallahassee in Leon County. US 319 meets SR 61 just south of Tallahassee, marking the northern end of SR 369, where it becomes a 4-lane divided highway, which turns into 6 lanes as the route meets SR 263 and forms part of the southern and eastern portion of the Capital Circle around Tallahassee. US 319 has the unsigned SR 261 designation between State Road 363/Woodville Highway and Capital Circle's eastern terminus at State Road 61/Thomasville Road. US 319 crosses I-10, before heading northeast out of the Tallahassee area. US 319 again becomes a 4-lane divided highway at its intersection with County Road 0342 about from I-10, and runs to the state line with Georgia. =Georgia= The route enters Georgia's Grady County co-signed with SR 35, and travels northeast in the direction of Thomasville in Thomas County, where the route forms the western and northern perimeter around Thomasville. US 319 then continues northeast, passes through Coolidge, and crosses into Colquitt County, running as a bypass around the east of Moultrie. The route crosses into Tift County and intersects with I-75 just before running through Tifton. In Ocilla, SR 35 comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with SR 32, which now becomes concurrent with US 319. Past Ocilla, the route, now co-signed with US 129, turns north and heads into Ben Hill County and through Fitzgerald, where it splits from US 129 and first heads east, and then north through the northwestern corner of Coffee County, where it meets up and is co-signed with US 441, and crosses the Ocmulgee River into Telfair County, Georgia at Jacksonville, Georgia and on into McRae- Helena. After briefly traversing the western corner of Wheeler County and eastern corner of Dodge County, US 319 continues north through Laurens County, crossing I-16 just before heading into and through Dublin and East Dublin, where US 441 splits off. Continuing northeast, the route heads into Johnson County, runs through Wrightsville, and heads into southern Jefferson County, where it turns east in Bartow, before meeting its northern terminus at US 1 and SR 4 in Wadley.

The section of US 319 that is co-signed with US 98 and SR 30 in Medart in Wakulla County was designated as \\"Agnes Morrison Memorial Highway\\" by the Florida State Legislature in 1961. From Kinhega Drive, about north of its intersection with I-10 in Leon County, to the Georgia state line, US 319 and SR 61 were designated as \\"Kate Ireland Parkway\\" by the Florida State Legislature in 1992. =Georgia= US 319 does not make an appearance on Georgia road maps until October 1937, when the spur from the Florida state line to Thomasville is shown, co-signed with SR 3. Prior to October 1937, US 19 appears as the designation of this section of the route. In July 1941, US 319 was extended from Thomasville, and ran through Moultrie, following what was signed as SR 35 at the time, to Cordele, co-signed with the current route taken by SR 33 from Moultrie. Since late in 1946, US 319 follows its current route. The section of US 319 that forms the Thomasville Bypass was designated as \\"Will Watt Parkway\\" in 1996 after a prominent resident of Thomasville. The section of US 319 that forms the east bypass around Moultrie in Colquitt County was designated as \\"Veterans Parkway\\" in 2002.

Its southern terminus is at US 19, US 84, SR 3, SR 38, and SR 300 in the northeastern part of Thomasville. Its northern terminus is at US 319/SR 35 northeast of the city. This highway used to be US 319 Bus./SR 35 Bus. in the city. =Thomasville business loop= State Route 35 Business (SR 35 Bus.) was a business route for SR 35 that served the downtown area of Thomasville. The route was decommissioned in 2007. =Moultrie business loop= U.S. Route 319 Business (US 319 Bus.) is a business route for US 319 that travels through the central portion of Moultrie. It is concurrent with SR 33 for its entire length. US 319 Bus. begins at an intersection with US 319/SR 35 (Veterans Parkway) and SR 33 (Pavo Road) in the south-central part of Moultrie. US 319 Bus. and SR 33 travel concurrently as South Main Street to the north-northwest and immediately curve to the north-northeast. An intersection with 32nd Avenue SE leads to Colquitt Regional Medical Center. One block later, an intersection with 31st Avenue leads to the hospital, as well. Just past an intersection with the eastern terminus of Hugh Bannister Drive, they begin a curve back to the north-northwest. Just south of an intersection with the northern terminus of Lower Meigs Road, the highways curve back to the north-northeast. An intersection with 11th Avenue leads to the Jim Buck Goff Recreation Complex. At 4th Avenue, the northbound lanes of US 319 and SR 33 turn right and travel to the east, while the southbound lanes stay on South Main Street. South Main Street remains a two-way street until 2nd Avenue SE. One block later, they turn left onto 1st Street SE and continue their northern direction. On the southeastern corner of the intersection with 2nd Avenue SE lies the main office for Southwest Georgia Bank. One block later, at 1st Avenue SE, they intersect the eastbound lanes of SR 37\\\\. Just north of this intersection, they pass the Colquitt County Courthouse. One block later, they intersect the westbound lanes of SR 37 (East Central Avenue). On the northeastern corner of this intersection lies the annex for the county courthouse. Here, 1st Street SE changes to 1st Street NE. At this same point, South Main Street changes back to a two-way street. At an intersection with 1st Avenue NE, 1st Street NE becomes a two-way street. On the southwestern corner of an intersection with 2nd Avenue NE lies the municipal building. On the northeaster corner lies the annex for the municipal building. Just north of 9th Avenue NE, they travel on a bridge over some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). North of Sylvester Drive, they have a roundabout with Sylvester Highway and the southbound lanes of US 319 Bus./SR 33\\\\. Just south of this roundabout is a sign for SR 33 south, even though it is actually still on Main Street. In fact, there is a directional sign in the roundabout that says that 1st Street NE is SR 33 south. The reunited lanes travel to the northeast. They cross over Okapilco Creek before they meet their northern terminus, an intersection with US 319/SR 35/SR 133 (Veterans Parkway/Tifton Highway). Here, SR 33 turns left onto East Bypass, concurrent with SR 133\\\\. Between 2nd Avenue NE and 4th Avenue NW, they pass the U.S. post office for the city. Whereas the northbound lanes travel on a bridge over the NS line, the southbound lanes actually meet them at a railroad crossing. Just south of Sylvester Drive, the southbound lanes have an intersection with SR 111 (West Bypass NW). SR 111 does not meet the northbound lanes, or vice versa. Just north of Sylvester Drive, northbound Main Street has signage that indicates that it is northbound US 319 Bus./SR 33, although they are actually on 1st Street NE.

Mandell) was a U.S. court case in 1868 where businesswoman Henrietta \\"Hetty\\" Howland Robinson, who would later become the richest woman in America, contested the validity of the will of her aunt, Sylvia Ann Howland. According to Howland's will, half of her $2 million estate () would go to various charities and entities, the rest would be in a trust for Robinson. Robinson challenged the will's validity by producing an earlier will that left the entire estate to Hetty, and which included a clause invalidating any subsequent wills. The case was ultimately decided against Robinson after the court ruled that the clause invalidating future wills and Sylvia's signature to it were forgeries.Robinson v. Mandell, 20 F. Cas. 1027 (C.C.D. Mass. 1868) (No. 11,959) It is famous for the forensic use of mathematics by Benjamin Peirce as an expert witness. History Sylvia Ann Howland died in 1865, leaving roughly half her fortune of some 2 million dollars () to various legatees, with the residue to be held in trust for the benefit of Robinson, Howland's niece. The remaining principal was to be distributed to various beneficiaries on Robinson's death. Robinson produced an earlier will, leaving her the whole estate outright. To the will was attached a second and separate page, putatively seeking to invalidate any subsequent wills. Howland's executor, Thomas Mandell, rejected Robinson's claim, insisting that the second page was a forgery, and Robinson sued. In the ensuing case of Robinson v. Mandell, Charles Sanders Peirce testified that he had made pairwise comparisons of 42 examples of Howland's signature, overlaying them and counting the number of downstrokes that overlapped. Each signature featured 30 downstrokes and he concluded that, on average, 6 of the 30 overlapped, 1 in 5. Benjamin Peirce showed that the number of overlapping downstrokes between two signatures also closely followed the binomial distribution, the expected distribution if each downstroke was an independent event. When the admittedly genuine signature on the first page of the contested will was compared with that on the second, all 30 downstrokes coincided, suggesting that the second signature was a tracing of the first. Benjamin Peirce, Charles' father, then took the stand and asserted that, given the independence of each downstroke, the probability that all 30 downstrokes should coincide in two genuine signatures was \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{2.666 \\\\times 10^{21}}. That is one in 2,666,000,000,000,000,000,000, in the order of magnitude of sextillions. He went on to observe: > So vast improbability is practically an impossibility. Such evanescent > shadows of probability cannot belong to actual life. They are unimaginably > less than those least things which the law cares not for. ... The > coincidence which has occurred here must have had its origin in an intention > to produce it. It is utterly repugnant to sound reason to attribute this > coincidence to any cause but design. The court ruled that Robinson's testimony in support of Howland's signature was inadmissible as she was a party to the will, thus having a conflict of interest. The statistical evidence was not called upon in judgment. The case is one of a series of attempts to introduce mathematical reasoning into the courts. People v. Collins is a more recent example.

It travels from Perry, Florida, at US 19/US 98/US 27 Alternate to Lynchburg, Virginia, at US 29 Business (Lynchburg Expressway). It travels through the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. It travels through the cities of Valdosta, Georgia; Spartanburg, South Carolina; Marion, North Carolina; Roanoke, Virginia; and Lynchburg, Virginia. Throughout western North Carolina, from the Virginia state line to the Blue Ridge Parkway, US 221 is a challenging drive, and can be described as one climb after another. There are few places where the road builders attempted to skirt around large foothills. Route description =Florida= A US 221 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 U.S. Route 221 originates just south of the city of Perry with its southern terminus intersecting with the cosigned U.S. Route 19 U.S. Route 98 and U.S. Route 27 Alternate, taking hidden SR 55 with it away from US 19. It continues through the city of Perry and intersects Interstate 10 and U.S. Route 90 in rural Madison County before crossing into Georgia. =Georgia= U.S. Route 221 runs through the cities of Quitman, Valdosta, Lakeland, Pearson, and Douglas in southern Georgia. In Quitman it joins U.S. Route 84 (cosigned Georgia State Route 38) to Valdosta. From Valdosta to Douglas it joins with Georgia State Route 31. It also joins with Georgia State Route 135 and State Route 56. From Pearson to Douglas it joins with US Route 441 as a four-lane highway, which was completed in 2000. In Douglas, U.S. Route 221 runs as the eastern part of Bowens Mill Rd. and will be widened in the future. It passes through Hazelhurst, Mount Vernon and Soperton before crossing Interstate 16, then later joins up with U.S. Route 1 and Georgia State Route 4 after passing through Louisville. After going through Wrens it splits off to the north cosigned with Georgia State Route 47 and passes through Harlem before crossing Interstate 20 /Georgia State Route 402 about 20 miles West of Augusta, GA. Shortly before crossing into South Carolina, Georgia State Route 150 joins up at the Pollards Corner intersection as Georgia 47 turns away. The passage into South Carolina occurs on top of the J. Strom Thurmond Dam which forms the southern shore of J. Strom Thurmond Lake. =South Carolina= U.S. Route 221 enters South Carolina in rural McCormick County at the southeast edge of Lake Strom Thurmond. It continues north and northwesterly to the town of McCormick. From McCormick, it continues northerly to the city of Greenwood. From Greenwood, U.S. Route 221 continues northeasterly to the city of Waterloo, South Carolina. U.S. Truck Route 221 bypasses the city of Laurens on the east side. It continues northerly and intersects Interstate 385 in rural Laurens County and proceeds to intersect Interstate 26 in rural Spartanburg County. U.S. Route 221 continues through the center of the city of Spartanburg before intersecting Interstate 85 just north of the city. It continues to the city of Chesnee before exiting the state in a rural area of Cherokee County. The southern terminus of U.S. Alternate Route 221 intersects the main route in the city of Chesnee and exits the state a few miles to the east of the main route. =North Carolina= U.S. Route 221 runs through the cities of Rutherfordton, Marion, Blowing Rock, Boone, and Jefferson. The highway is majority 2-lane, while 4-lane in Marion, Blowing Rock, and Boone. Two sections of the highway can be considered challenging and twisty: 13-mile stretch between Linville and Blowing Rock, and a 21-mile stretch between Jefferson and Twin Oaks. U.S. Route 221 has one Alternate (continuing from South Carolina) and two Business Routes (in Marion and Jefferson). It intersects two major highways: U.S. Route 74 near Rutherfordton and I-40 near Marion; and also intersects with the Blue Ridge Parkway four times. =Virginia= View north along US 221 at SR 615 just north of Floyd, Virginia In Virginia, US 221 runs from the North Carolina state line near Independence north to its northern terminus at US 29 Business, US 460 Business, and US 501 Business in Lynchburg. US 221 connects Independence, Galax, and Hillsville in Southwest Virginia while running concurrently with US 58. The U.S. Highway connects those communities with Roanoke via Floyd County, within which US 221 is the main west‚Äìeast highway.

It extends westward from the Potomac River waterfront near the Torpedo Factory Art Center and nearby bustling tourist gift shops and restaurants, passing City Hall and the Alexandria General District Court.  History  Cafe along King Street In 1964 Richard Muzzrole begins nine years of excavations along King Street. In 1965 artifacts from King Street homes, shops, and taverns are excavated by Malcolm Watkins of the Smithsonian Institution. During the 1960s urban renewal prompted the demolition of a six block area along King Street. In 1965 Bulldozers revealed creamware, glasswork, porcelain, and pottery. Bulldozers preparing for parking garage construction revealed brick lined wells. In 1977 Pamela Cressey begins excavations at the King Street courthouse. Deep wear marks on wine bottles found within King Street privies reveal the practice of refilling bottles at taverns. King Street in the mid-twentieth century In 2007 the American Planning Association listed King Street as a \\"2011 Great Place in America\\" within the \\"Great Streets\\" category. King Street is currently seen as an active strip of commerce and tourism that successfully accommodates both Alexandria's local residents as well as its visitors. Historically the street was used as access to the seaport and later as a main center of trade. The balance between past and present is noticeable with the vitality of the street's noteworthy character. Architectural and demolition regulations have been employed to allow for the continued visual appeal of 18th and 19th century buildings. Zoning laws, particularly those established in 2005 and 2007, are responsible for ensuring mixed use on this street. Various businesses, outdoor dining and other activities can be found all along King Street. One amenity to this street is the Market Square found at Alexandria City Hall as it is one of the oldest U.S farmers markets and is often used to provide venue space for concerts, festivals, and community events. Other features found on King Street include Alexandria City Hall, which is in the style of the period during the Second Empire, and clock tower that was designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe. The Torpedo Factory Art Center is another hotspot for tourism and is currently used as studio housing for artists.  Route  On reaching the Washington Metro and Amtrak stations and the George Washington National Masonic Memorial, King Street bends. Between Russell Road and Janney's Lane, green bike lanes exist. Wealthier residents fought against these. King Street passes Chinquapin Recreation Center, T.C. Williams High School and several historic churches, becoming Leesburg Pike as it leaves Alexandria at Bailey's Crossroads. King Street becomes State Route 7 west of Washington Street (State Route 400). In Old Town Alexandria, King Street is designated as the dividing line between north and south in the addressing system, while Duke Street (State Route 236) is designated as the dividing line in the West End area of Alexandria. King Street follows the original southwest border for the District of Columbia, becoming Leesburg Pike then Route 7 as it extends westward into Fairfax County.  Transportation The Washington Metro has a station at King Street, just west of Old Town, on the Blue and Yellow Lines. Also, the King Street Trolley takes passengers on a ride along King Street every 15 minutes.

It is located south of Lawrence and north of Baldwin City. History The first settlement was made at Vinland in 1854. In the earliest days of the community, some called it \\"Coal Creek\\", due to deposits of the sedimentary rock in a nearby waterway. The settlement eventually earned the name \\"Vineland\\" (after the orchard of one of the first settlers, William Barnes), which later evolved into \\"Vinland\\" after a clerical error. Most of the settlers of the early community were abolitionists or Free-Staters from New England, and consequently, they opposed the extension of slavery into Kansas Territory. In 1859, Annie Soule and Martha Cutter helped found a library (and an associated book club), in the hopes that it \\"would contribute to the 'moral, social, and intellectual improvement of [the settlement's] members\\"; specifically, they hoped \\"to prevent dancing from becoming the only amusement in the community.\\" The library initially boasted a collection 10 books (which eventually grew to over 2,000), and residents of the small town were allowed to check them out if they contributed an annual fee of 50 cents. The building that currently holds the collection was constructed in 1900 when the community's book supply grew too large. Today, Coal Creek Library is considered the oldest subscription library in the state. Vinland was not legally platted until the 1860s. A post office was opened in Vinland in 1868, and remained in operation until 1954. In 1912, the population of the settlement was 75, and it housed \\"a fine agricultural district ... [and] express and telegraph facilities\\". Today, the Vinland Grange Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Account According to the mythology of the Wintum tribe, Olelbis desired that the members of the human race should live together as brothers and sisters; that there should be no birth and no death, that life should be agreeable and easy, and the purpose of life should be to rejoining Olelbis in heaven and live with him for all eternity. To satisfy the hunger of the human body, Olelbis created a species of nut which has no shell and falls off the tree when it is ripe (this species of nut or fruit is still a staple item of the Wintum's diet). Olelbis ordered two brothers to build a paved road from earth to heaven to facilitate the tribe's reunion with their Creator. But Sedit appeared on the scene and persuaded one of the brothers that it would be better to engage in sexual intercourse and procreate the human species. The one persuaded by Sedit argued the other into agreement, so both defected from Olelbis and joined together to destroy the road they were building to heaven. Sedit, horrified when he finds he has brought death to the human race and must die himself, tries to escape his fate. He makes himself a mechanism of boughs and leaves (a plane), by means of which he hopes to fly to heaven. But he crashes and is killed. Olelbis looks down from the heights of heaven and says, \\"See.

He was the heir to the estate of Wisconsin millionaire Hercules Louis Dousman, who had made a career in Prairie du Chien. Dousman had a new mansion built on the site of his family's house, and then soon moved away, living for years in St. Paul, Minnesota, and St. Louis, Missouri. In both cities he moved in upper social circles. After his mother's death in 1882, Dousman began to develop the family property to establish a stock farm and racing for Standardbred horses. He built a racetrack and started an annual race in July 1883. He returned to the city in 1885, establishing the Artesian Stock Farm, but died unexpectedly the next year before getting it well underway. His widow closed the farm and named the mansion as Villa Louis after Louis Dousman. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. Early life and education Louis Dousman was born in 1848 in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the son of Hercules and Jane (Fisher) Rolette Dousman. His father had been a fur trader and developed great wealth as an investor and entrepreneur on the frontier, influential in expanding railroad construction across the state, exploiting the lumber industry, and investing in real estate. He was a millionaire before he died, when the United States held few figures of such wealth. As a child, Louis was privately tutored; he later attended a preparatory school in Madison, Wisconsin. His higher education was cut short by the death of his father in 1868. The son returned to Prairie du Chien to take care of his father's estate and help his widowed mother Jane. Life as heir In 1870, at the age of 22, Dousman began using his inheritance. He demolished the brick house built by his father, where he had grown up, and replaced it with a modern mansion of the era. It was designed in the Italianate style by E. Townsend Mix. Dousman did not stay long in Prairie du Chien. In 1872, he moved to the larger city of Saint Paul, Minnesota, leaving his mother to occupy the Prairie du Chien estate. Owing to his wealth and his father's onetime partnership with Henry Hastings Sibley, who had earlier served as Governor of Minnesota, Dousman rose quickly in St. Paul society. In 1873 he married Nina Sturgis, and the couple moved to St. Louis, Missouri. They had five children: Violet, Virginia, Nina, Louis, and Judith Dousman. Dousman's father had also had prominent connections in St. Louis. Dousman readily entered its uppermost social circles. He began a career as an art collector, amassing a collection of nearly a hundred paintings, mostly Academic art from France. In 1879, he constructed a gallery adjoining his St. Louis home to showcase his collection and began opening the gallery to the public. His art collection was eventually published in 1881. Dousman received much attention in both St. Louis and other major cities across the nation for his collection. He served as art director for three years for the St. Louis Fair. In the 1880s his interest began to shift. Following the death of his mother in 1882, Dousman sold most of his art collection at auction in New York City. He made plans to return to Prairie du Chien. He wanted to develop the larger part of his property into a stock farm for the breeding of Standardbred horses, specifically, a line descended from Hambletonian 10. Dousman had stables and a racetrack built in Prairie du Chien, and began hosting an annual race in July 1883. He named his estate as the Artesian Stock Farm, because of the artesian wells on the property. Dousman moved all of his family from St. Louis to Prairie du Chien in 1885. Dousman's plans for the Artesian Stock Farm were never fully realized. On January 13, 1886, he died unexpectedly of appendicitis. After Dousman's death, his wife Nina sold the horses and closed the stock farm. She renamed the mansion and its associated property as Villa Louis in honor of her late husband. Today Villa Louis is preserved and operated as a museum by the Wisconsin Historical Society. It is designated as a National Historic Landmark.

Though numbered as a daughter route of U.S. Route 21, it does not actually intersect its parent or any of its sibling routes, though it is in the same general part of the U.S. as other routes from its family. Historically, it once connected to U.S. 21 in Pineville, North Carolina, but various changes have left it terminating a few miles short of the current U.S. 21. Route description =South Carolina= Starting at the city of Georgetown, US 521 runs through the town Andrews to Greeleyville. From here to the city of Manning it is known as the Greeleyville Highway. There is a brief section right before Manning where it runs concurrent with SC 261\\\\. In Manning SC 261 branches off and US 521 merges with US 301 for a short distance. It crosses over I-95 and heads to the city of Sumter. In Sumter, it runs together with US Business 378. Leaving Sumter, US 521 is known as Camden Highway. It passes under I-20 and proceeds to Camden. It then goes on to the town of Kershaw, running concurrent with US 601\\\\. The final city it goes through before going into North Carolina is Lancaster. =North Carolina= US 521 traverses from the South Carolina state line to Interstate 485. The entire route is a four to six-lane divided highway, split in naming between Lancaster Highway and Johnston Road. History Established in 1932, it was overlapped entirely with SC 26, from Georgetown to the North Carolina state line, where it continued with NC 26 into Pineville, where it ended at U.S. Route 21/NC 261 (now NC 51). In 1933, SC 26 was decommissioned; followed in 1934 with the decommissioning of NC 26\\\\. In 1949, US 521 was rerouted in Williamsburg County to run directly from Andrews, through Salters and Greeleyville, to Manning; which replaced SC 171 and part of SC 261, the old alignment became part of SC 377 and SC 261. Between 1962-64, US 521 was rerouted at the Sumter-Kershaw county line to Camden; the old alignment became an extension of SC 261. In 1969, US 521 was extended north, via South Boulevard, and Wilkinson Blvd, then in 1981, by way of Woodlawn Road, and Billy Graham Parkway, to Interstate 85 in Charlotte. Between 1986-88, US 521 was moved west onto new highway west of Dalzell, bypassing the town; the old alignment was downgraded to secondary roads. In 1996, US 521 was rerouted onto Interstate 485, between exits 61 and 65; the old alignment was downgraded to secondary roads. In 2003, AASHTO approved US 521 to be truncated at its current northern terminus at the Johnston Road/Interstate 485 interchange; its old alignment north to Interstate 85 was downgraded to secondary roads. Future There are plans to make US 521 a four-lane highway from Georgetown to Interstate 95, in Manning. This would improve a route for beach goers traveling toward the Litchfield/Pawleys area.

MDA is also notable for its 55-year working partnership with comedian, actor, singer and filmmaker Jerry Lewis, who served as its national chairman from 1956 to 2011 while hosting his live annual telethon each Labor Day weekend from 1966 to 2010. Frank Sinatra, Don Rickles, Sammy Davis, Jr., Milton Berle, Wayne Newton, Norm Crosby, Don Francisco, Tony Orlando, Johnny Carson, Aretha Franklin, Maureen McGovern, Diana Ross and other entertainers have also supported MDA over the years. Its national office is in Chicago, Illinois.  History  The organization was founded in 1950 by a group with personal connections to muscular dystrophy.

In 2005, the MDA made the unprecedented decision to pledge $1 million of the telethon's money raised to Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, making the donation specifically to the Salvation Army (though the telethon also urged viewers to give to the American Red Cross). In 2008, the annual televised fundraiser raised a record $65,031,393. Official MDA Logo used until January 29, 2016.

The MDA argued that \\"many of the drug therapies currently under development for MDA's community will be of most benefit if administered either presymptomatically or early in the progression of the disease. Thus, for some of the diseases in MDA's program, the availability of a newborn screening program at the time of treatment availability presents the best opportunity for impacting optimal and potential lifesaving treatment outcomes.\\" The MDA supported the Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research and Education Amendments of 2013 (H.R. 594; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to revise the muscular dystrophy research program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). MDA argued that \\"a great deal of work still needs to be done, and increased federal support is needed to ensure that researchers can continue making progress toward finding a cure.\\" Charity Assessments According to a Better Business Bureau summary released in September, 2015, the Organization: *oversees a network of 200 hospital-affiliated clinics providing diagnosis and treatment, including more than 40 MDA/ALS centers for Lou Gehrig's disease *offers diagnostic and follow-up care, support groups, summer camps for children (aged 6-17), and assistance to repairs medical equipment *funds research for disease treatments and cures *has a paid staff of 812 people *received $145.3 million donated because of fund-raising activities, 15% of which was spent on the fund-raising activities.

Made of leather or fur, the ornamentation of the sporran is chosen to complement the formality of dress worn with it. The sporran is worn on a leather strap or chain, conventionally positioned in front of the groin of the wearer. Since the traditional kilt does not have pockets, the sporran serves as a wallet and container for any other necessary personal items. It is essentially a survival of the common European medieval belt-pouch, superseded elsewhere as clothing came to have pockets, but continuing in the Scottish Highlands because of the lack of these accessories in traditional dress. The sporran hangs below the belt buckle; and much effort is made to match their style and design. The kilt belt buckle may be very ornate, and contain similar motifs to the sporran cantle and the Sgian Dubh. Early sporrans would have been worn suspended from the belt on one or other of the hips, rather than hung from a separate strap in front of the wearer. When driving a car, dancing, playing drums, or engaging in any activity where a heavy pouch might encumber the wearer, the sporran may be turned around the waist to let it hang on the hip in a more casual position. Types A man wearing tartan, including a large sporran (Russell) NLW3363120 Unknown United Kingdom soldier wearing a two tassel sporran and a grey kilt [1921] = Day sporrans = Day sporrans are usually brown leather shovel pouches with simple adornment. These \\"day\\" sporrans often have three or more leather tassels and frequently Celtic knot designs carved or embossed into the leather. This style of traditional purse is convenient to use on a daily basis. This style is often made entirely of leather, with a leather flap, front, and three tassels or more. They are often embossed or hand-tooled with Celtic, thistle, or other designs on the flap and body, and fasten with a stud or hook closure. Day sporran = Dress sporrans = Dress sporrans can be larger than the day variety, and are often highly ornate. Victorian examples were usually quite ostentatious, and much more elaborate than the simple leather pouch of the 17th or 18th centuries. They may have sterling or silver-plated cantles trimming the top of the pouch and a fur-covered face with fur or hair tassels. The cantle may contain intricate filigree or etchings of Celtic knots. The top of the cantle may have a set stone, jewel, or emblems such as Saint Andrew, a thistle, Clan, or Masonic symbols. Full-dress sporrans This style is regarded as the most formal type of sporran. It is an essential attachment for those who wear kilts in special ceremonies and formal events. Prince Charlie often wore this style of sporran to formal occasions. It normally contains fur fronts, a fur gusset, 3‚Äî6 decorative fur tassels with regular or cross chains, and a metal cantle at the top. The cantle arcs along the top of the pouch and conceals a clasp, ordinarily made from pewter or silver. It might be decorated with Celtic symbols such as the lion rampant, thistle, stag, or Saltire. Some elaborate cantles may include gemstones, such as garnets. This style commonly fastens at the rear with a stud on a small flap that connects the front and rear of the sporran. It allows the wearer to carry a range of items due to the larger size of this sporran. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental full-dress sporran  Semi-dress sporrans  Semi-dress sporrans combine the same shape and design as the day-wear sporran and a less formal version of the full dress sporran. They are often worn for semi-formal occasions with Argyll outfits. Designs may decorate the leather flap of this style, or a silver clan symbol or other insignia may adorn on the flap. The body fur of this style is normally a hair hide rather than a loftier material reserved for full dress sporrans. The basic figure is commonly included with a fur front, leather gusset, three decorated fur tassels with regular or cross-chains, and a leather flap at the top. Celtic or Scottish designs often are featured on the flap, and may have pewter badges' decoration to raise the design.  Full mask sporrans  This style is commonly made from the head of an animal such as the badger, otter, fox, kangaroo mouse, pine marten, or other small animals. The animal's head typically forms the front flap of the pouch, and the body of the pouch is made from the same pelt. This style displays the Scottish tradition, since the earliest pouches probably included the head with the pelt. Today, people do not wear this style very often for standard formal occasions, though it may be worn in historic re-enactments and festivals as a costume accessory. Badger-head sporran on display in The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental Museum  Horsehair sporrans  This style is most commonly worn as part of regimental attire for the pipers or the drummers. In general, it is one of the most dramatic and biggest of dress-sporrans with a very formal style. A traditional horsehair pouch extends just below the belt to just below the hem of the kilt. The most ordinary pattern contains black horsehair tassels on a white horsehair background. Pewter or silver cantle is also carved on the sporran. This style made from horsehide rather than tail hair, are more able to keep with the compact shape and decor of less showy, semi-dress versions. Horsehair sporran on display in The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental Museum  Materials and law  As sporrans are made of animal skin, their production, ownership, and transportation across borders may be regulated by legislation set to control the trade of protected and endangered species. A 2007 BBC report on legislation introduced by the Scottish Executive stated that sporran owners may need licences to prove that the animals used in construction of their pouch conformed to these regulations. In 2009, European politicians voted to ban the sale of seal products putting an end to the use of seal in sporran production. Tradition in Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regiment =Tradition= Soldiers did not wear sporrans very often in daily life. The main function of sporrans were used as haversack, for each Highlander carried his own provision of oatmeal‚Äîeating it if necessary, raw, or mixed with a little cold water‚Äîas did Montrose in the dawn before the Battle of Inverlochy. To have enough comfort for a soldier to be able to walk, the sporran usually would be worn as high as possible. Soldiers normally could get a sporran from the regimental office free of charge, as long as they gave it back when they left the Regiment. However, some officers and sergeants had to pay and book their own unique styles of sporrans. That sporran was their private property, no matter if they still stayed and served in the Regiments. For most highlander regiments, they used different number of tassels to distinguish their own unique symbol. For example, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiment used six tassels on sporrans to differ with other highlanders' regiments. The general rules for six tassels are: two at the top in a line, two under them in a line, and two in the centre to hang below these, so that a line drawn across the bottom of the side tassels would pass through the centre of the centre tassels. The sporran-belt when on the man is to be cut to three inches from the buckle, and to be cut to a point in the shoemaker's shop‚Äîit is not to be doubled into the keeper, one keeper will be sufficient‚Äîand the point of strap will be in the direction of the right hip, and the buckle will be worn exactly over the spine and not to one side. The tradition of wearing sporran in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regiment is a bit different from the daily wearing of other highlanders. The official description of the dress sporran is \\"engraved gilt top, five sided, square edges, with centre in black enamel. On the centre, Boar's head and scroll. Princess' Coronet on top with her Cypher, the cat and scroll similar to full dress headdress. Six small gold bullion tassels.\\" Here is the Dress Regulations to indicate; the dress sporran was not to exceed eleven inches in length, and the badger-skin sporran no more than thirteen inches. The dress sporran was not to have more than six tassels. Officers were permitted to wear undress sporran resembling the men's. Goatskins with silver tassels were differed as the style of the officers' sporran with other ranks. The knobs (i.e. the bells) on the tassels of the officer's purse were ordered to the gilt. The rank-and-file purse was of black hair with white tassels, and was still larger and broader than formerly. =Typical types= In terms of historic records, there are six different types of sporran which were used in the Regimental events. The Badger-head sporrans were typically used by the officers and sergeants. The horsehair sporrans were widely used in different ranks. The swinging six sporrans were extremely popular for the soldiers. Badger-head sporran typically forms as the front flap of the pouch, and the body of the pouch is made from the same pelt. From the year 1800, the badger skin probably was a widely used material for sporrans and became a new fashion trend for the officers and sergeants as in most Highland corps, opening in front, with a straight narrow silver or brass top, edged with crimson leather, two rows of small white tassels and silver bells, mounted on red leather and suspended by twisted white leather thongs or cords. In ordinary occasions, officers and sergeants started to wear a sporran of badger skin with the head and narrow brass curved top, edged with black leather, and six white tassels in brass cups. The rank and file wore similar ones of black or grey goatskin, but the white tassels had red cords. The sporran had a white buff leather strap and was somewhat smaller and squarer than the modern pattern. It was worn in the old fashion, well braced up, close to the jacket. These sporrans, unlike the present day ones, had a large roomy pouch, the opening being concealed by the flat top. Horsehair sporran was normally worn by pipers and drummers of the Regimental music band. The most ordinary pattern contains black horsehair tassels on a white horsehair background. Pewter or silver cantle is also carved on the sporran. Sometimes, the pattern thistle decorated cantle and tassel tops. It's widely distinguished as the most popular pattern of an officer's sporran with white horsehair background, and normal soldier's with black horsehair background. Swinging six sporran is generally known as a \\"swinging six\\" due to the six white horse hair tassels which hang from the front of the sporran, made of black goatskin. Behind the brass cantle is a leather purse to keep money or personal items in. The style of sporran was adopted as part of the Sutherland Highlanders' uniform between 1823 and 1826 and was later worn as part of the uniform of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regiment after the 93rd and 91st amalgamated in 1881. This type of sporran was commonly worn by the sergeants and soldiers. White sporran was issued as a buff coloured leather sporran that had to be coated in a white liquid which dried to form a white surface (This often rubbed off onto the front of the kilt). A regimental sporran badge was then attached to the front. This style was only worn on limited occasions and did not replace the swinging six sporrans or the other plain leather one, both of which continued to be worn throughout this period. Most soldiers were happy when the white sporran was no longer issued as part of the uniform of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Civilian sporran worn by General Duncan Campbell of Lochnell. The sporran has a silver cantle, a border decorated with thistle foliage, and a central coat of arms of the Campbell of Lochnell family; six silver thread tassels; and, a white goat hair covering on a white/light tan leather sporran edged in black leather. Plain leather sporran has become very popular today, as it is convenient to wear daily. This style concentrates on practical function more than aesthetic value, it only keeps the Regimental badge without six tassels and another decorative pattern. This style is an essential accessory for the kilt to hold money, keys, etc. Plain Leather Sporran 1.jpgalt=Plain leather sporran 1Lieutenant Colonel's sporran, belongs to The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental Museum Swinging Six Sporran.jpgalt=Swinging six sporranSoldier's sporran, belongs to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regimental Museum'' Boar‚Äôs head and scroll.jpgalt=Boar's head and scrollBoar's head and scroll.

He was subsequently subject to sanctions by both the U.S. State Department and the U.N. Security Council freezing his assets. With Omar Bakri Muhammad, Choudary helped form an Islamist organisation, al-Muhajiroun. The group organised several anti-Western demonstrations, including a banned protest march in London for which Choudary was summoned to appear in court. The UK government banned Al-Muhajiroun. Choudary was present at the launch of its intended successor, Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. He later helped form Al Ghurabaa, which was also banned. Choudary then became the spokesman for Islam4UK until it was proscribed. He has been denounced by mainstream Muslim groups, and has been largely criticised in the UK media. A critic of the UK's involvement in the wars in Iraq (2003‚Äì11) and Afghanistan (2001‚Äì16), Choudary praised those responsible for the 11 September 2001 and 7 July 2005 attacks. He promotes the implementation of Sharia law throughout the UK, Poland and India. He marched in protest at the Jyllands-Posten cartoons controversy, following which he was prosecuted for organising an unlawful demonstration. During a protest outside Westminster Cathedral in 2006, Choudary told demonstrators that the Pope should be executed for insulting Islam. On 6 September 2016, Choudary was sentenced to five years and six months in prison following conviction for inviting others to support the proscribed organisation ISIS. He was released automatically on licence in October 2018. Early life Born in London on 18 January 1967, Anjem Choudary is the son of a Welling market trader and is of Pakistani descent; his parents migrated to what became Pakistan during the partition of India. He attended Mulgrave Primary School, in Woolwich. In 1996, Choudary married Rubana Akhtar, or Akhgar, who had recently joined al-Muhajiroun, which he led at the time. She later became the group's head of women. The couple have four children. He enrolled as a medical student at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, where he was known as Andy, but failed his first-year exams. While attending university, he was reputed to have indulged in drink and drugs. Responding to claims that he was a \\"party animal\\" who joined his friends in \\"getting stoned\\", in 2014 Choudary commented \\"I admit that I wasn't always practising... I committed many mistakes in my life.\\". He switched to law at the University of Southampton and spent his final year as a legal student (1990‚Äì1991) at Guildford, before moving to London to teach English as a second language. He found work at a legal firm and completed his legal qualifications to become a lawyer. Choudary became the chairman of the Society of Muslim Lawyers, but was removed from the roll of solicitors (the official register of legal practitioners) in 2002. Jihadist military training in Britain On 7 November 1999, the Sunday Telegraph reported that Muslims were receiving weapons training at secret locations in Britain. Most of those who trained at these centres would then fight for Osama Bin Laden's International Islamic Front in Chechnya, while others would fight in such places as Kosovo, Sudan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir. The report identified Anjem Choudary as a key figure in recruiting for these training centres.Osama bin Laden's fighters train in Britain Indian ExpressFundamentalists receive training in Britain British Muslims Monthly Survey Organisations =Al- Muhajiroun= Choudary embraced Islamism and, with the Islamist militant leader Omar Bakri Muhammed, co-founded al-Muhajiroun, a Salafi organisation. The two men had met at a local mosque, where Bakri was giving a tafsir (an interpretation of the Qur'an). In 2002, following a bazaar organised by al- Muhajiroun (advertised by leaflet and word of mouth), Choudary gave a talk on education at Slough. His lecture outlined his ideas for a parallel system of Islamic education in the UK and included elements of the group's ideology. In the same year, although they were refused a permit by the then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, on 25 August the group held a rally in London. Choudary was summonsed to Bow Street Magistrates' Court in January 2003, on charges which included \\"exhibiting a notice, advertisement or any other written or pictorial matter\\", \\"using apparatus for the amplification of sound\\", \\"making a public speech or address\\" and \\"organising an assembly\\". In 2003 or 2004, he organised an Islamic-themed camping trip, at which Bakri lectured, on the grounds of the Jameah Islamiyah School in East Sussex. Advertised by word-of-mouth, the trip was attended by 50 Muslim men, most of whom were members of al-Muhajiroun. Bakri later claimed the camp's activities included lectures on Islam, football and paintballing. In September 2006, following allegations that it was used in the training and recruitment of terrorists, police searched the school. According to testimony from Al Qaeda suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp, in 1997 and 1998 Abu Hamza and groups of around 30 of his followers held training camps at the school, which included training with AK47 rifles and handguns, and a mock rocket launcher. No arrests were made, and students and faculty were allowed to return on 23 September 2006, the first day of Ramadan. The UK government had investigated expelling Bakri even before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and in July 2003 the headquarters of al-Muhajiroun, and the homes of Bakri and Choudary, were raided by the police. The following year, under new anti-terrorist legislation, the government announced that it wanted to ban al-Muhajiroun. In 2005, Bakri learned that he was at risk of prosecution for his support of the 7 July 2005 London bombers, and in August left the UK for Lebanon, where he claimed that he was on holiday. After leaving a television station where he said \\"I will not return to Britain unless I want to go there as a visitor or as a tourist\\", he was detained by Lebanon's general security department and held in a Beirut prison. Several days later, Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, on the grounds that his presence in Britain was \\"not conducive to the public good.\\" Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban. He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return. In November, Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon and returned to the UK. Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations, claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah. Following his deportation, Choudary attended the launch in London of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, the intended successor organisation to al-Muhajiroun. Choudary said that Bakri was not on the committee of the new group, but that \\"we would love for the sheikh to have a role.\\" The organisation operates mainly through an invitation-only internet forum, to which Choudary contributes under the screen name Abou Luqman. A reporter visiting the site found calls for holy war, and recordings by Osama Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Omar Bakri Mohammed. Al-Muhajiroun attempted a relaunch in June 2009 at Conway Hall, in Holborn. Several speakers were invited to share a platform with Choudary, but some later claimed that they had been invited under false pretences. When the group refused to allow women into the meeting, the chairman of the society that runs the hall cancelled the event. He was heckled by many of those in the audience. Choudary took the microphone from the chairman and led chants of \\"Sharia for UK\\", saying in reference to the exclusion of women: \\"Jews and Christians will never make peace with you until you either become like them or adopt their ways.\\" Outside the hall, Choudary criticised British society, predicting that Muslims would make up the majority within one or two decades. When asked why, if society were so bad, he lived here, he replied: \\"We come here to civilise people, get them to come out of the darkness and injustice into the beauty of Islam.\\" =Al Ghurabaa= Choudary was also a spokesman for Al Ghurabaa, believed to have been an offshoot of al-Muhajiroun. It was proscribed in 2006 by the then Home Secretary John Reid. Choudary was outraged: \\"The easy option when one is losing an argument is to ban the opposition voice. ... We [al- Ghurabaa] are not a military organisation; we have only been vociferous in our views‚Äîviews concerning everything from the government's foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan to the host of draconian laws, which they‚Äôve introduced against us in this country.\\" =Islam4UK= In November 2008, Choudary organised a meeting of the then recently formed Islam4UK, which, according to its website, was \\"established by sincere Muslims as a platform to propagate the supreme Islamic ideology within the United Kingdom as a divine alternative to man-made law\\", and to \\"convince the British public about the superiority of Islam ... thereby changing public opinion in favour of Islam in order to transfer the authority and power ... to the Muslims in order to implement the Sharee‚Äôah (here in Britain)\\". According to Ed Husain, co-founder of the counter-terrorism think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, Islam4UK was a \\"splinter group of al-Muhajiroun and Hizb ut-Tahrir, the originators of extremism in Britain.\\" The meeting, advertised as a conference to \\"rise to defend the honour of the Muslims\\", was held at the Brady Arts and Community Centre in Tower Hamlets. Choudary then announced that Bakri would be speaking, via a video-conference link, although technical problems meant that his address was instead given over a telephone line. When asked by a Muslim woman how the comments of one of the event's speakers could be justified, with regard to Islam being a religion of peace, Choudary stated, \\"Islam is not a religion of peace ... It is a religion of submission. We need to submit to the will of Allah.\\" With the announcement by Islam4UK that it planned to hold a protest march through Wootton Bassett (known for the military funeral repatriations of dead British soldiers returning from the war in Afghanistan), Choudary said \\"You may see one or two coffins being returned to the UK every other day, but when you think about the people of Afghanistan its a huge number [being killed] in comparison ... I intend to write a letter to the parents of British soldiers telling them the reality of what they died for.\\" Choudary's open letter was published on 3 January 2010. It explained his reasons for proposing the march, endorsed his religious beliefs, and claimed that UK politicians had been lying about the war. Choudary wrote that the proposed march was to \\"engage the British public's minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war.\\" In an interview with Sky News, he stated that the location was chosen to effect a level of media attention which \\"it would not have gained anywhere else\\". The proposal was condemned by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said that to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be \\"completely inappropriate\\". The Minhaj-ul-Quran International UK centre in Forest Gate also condemned the proposal, as did the Muslim Council of Britain, which stated that it \\"condemns the call by the fringe extremist group Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett.\\" The planned march was cancelled by the group on 10 January 2010. From 14 January 2010, Islam4UK was proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000, making membership illegal and punishable by imprisonment. Choudary condemned the order. In an interview on BBC Radio he said \\"we are now being targeted as an extremist or terrorist organisation and even banned for merely expressing that\\" and \\"I feel this is a failure of the concept of democracy and freedom.\\" Following his arrest and subsequent release in September 2014 on suspicion of encouraging terrorism, Choudary claimed he was questioned about his membership of or support for proscribed groups including Islam4UK and Need4Khalifah, both of which the government believes are successors to al-Muhajiroun. Views Choudary referred to the 11 September 2001 terrorists as \\"magnificent martyrs\\". In 2003, he said that al- Muhajiroun would \\" people to fulfil their Islamic duties and responsibilities\\", although he also said that the group was a political movement and not responsible for individual actions. In 2004, he said that a terror attack on British soil was \\"a matter of time\\". He refused to condemn the 7 July 2005 London bombings, but accused the Muslim Council of Britain (who had) of \\"selling their souls to the devil\\". He blamed the 2013 murder of Lee Rigby, an off-duty British soldier, on British foreign policy. Choudary has voiced support for the Muslim community in Somalia, who, he claims, have been \\"violated\\" by Christian-backed Ethiopians, and has also called for other members to fight jihad. The Wall Street Journal describes Choudary as a supporter of \\"the fundamentalist strain of Islamic teaching known as Salafism\\". He believes in the primacy of Islam over all other faiths, and the implementation of Sharia Law, in its entirety, in the UK. In 2001, he stated that his allegiance is to Islam, and not a country. He believes that, for a true Muslim, \\"a British passport is no more than a travel document.\\" In October 2006, he addressed an audience at Trinity College, Dublin to oppose the motion that \\"This house believes that Islamist violence can never be justified\\". In February 2008 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, commented that \\"as a matter of fact certain provisions of sharia are already recognised in our society and under our law\\". Choudary responded by saying that Sharia \\"has to be adopted wholesale\\", and that \\"it will come either by embracing Islam because it is the fastest growing religion in the country, or by an Islamic country conquering Britain or by elements embracing Islam and imposing it.\\" In 2008, he spoke of the \\"flag of Sharia\\" flying over Downing Street by 2020, claimed that some Muslim families in east London were having \\"10 or 12 children each\\", and that hundreds were converting to Islam each day. Choudary has spoken against elements of the Christian faith. In December 2008, he posted a sermon on an Islamic website, in which he stated: \\"Every Muslim has a responsibility to protect his family from the misguidance of Christmas, because its observance will lead to hellfire. Protect your Paradise from being taken away ‚Äì protect yourself and your family from Christmas\\". In an interview with Iran's Press TV (which was subsequently posted online on 11 April 2013), Choudary stated \\"As Muslims, we reject democracy, we reject secularism, and freedom, and human rights. We reject all of the things that you espouse as being ideals ... There is nothing called a republic in Islam. When we talk about the shari'a, we are talking about only the shari'a. We are talking about rejecting the U.N., the IMF, and the World Bank.\\"British Islamist Anjem Choudary: As Muslims We Reject Human Rights , MEMRI, 11 April 2013, Clip No. 3842 (transcript) (video available here . In 2013, the British pressure group Hope not Hate presented a report which identified Choudary as \\"a serious player on the international Islamist scene\\", saying that although there was no evidence that he was directly responsible for instigating any terrorist plots, \\"he helped shape the mindset of many of those behind them\\" and \\"through his networks linked them up to terror groups and supporters across the world.\\" Choudary dismissed the claims as \\"fanciful\\", saying that if they were true, UK security services would have arrested him. In September 2014, Choudary described Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as \\"the caliph of all Muslims and the prince of the believers\\". Facing a court sentence for inciting terrorism, Choudhary wanted to move to the Islamic State, but said that the reason was that he thought it a much better society in terms of welfare benefits and other factors.Patrick Hill: 'I'd go tomorrow': Islamic extremist Anjem Choudary wants to leave UK and move to war torn Middle East Daily Mirror, 18 October 2014. Activism Choudary has regularly attended public marches and, following a protest march outside the Danish Embassy in London on 3 February 2006, held in response to the Jyllands- Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, he was a member of a panel of interviewees on the BBC news programme Newsnight. He defended Muslims in Britain, saying that \\"we live in peace with the host community, we are not allowed to target people here\\", and claimed that the police had inspected and allowed the controversial placards used in the demonstration. Choudary was criticised by his fellow panellists, who included Ann Cryer, then MP for Keighley, Humera Khan, of the al-Nisa Muslim Women's Group (who accused him of demonising Islam), Sayeeda Warsi, the vice-chair of the Conservative Party, Professor Tariq Ramadan (who claimed that Choudary's actions were designed to evoke a strong response from the media), and Roger Knapman, the leader of the UK Independence Party. On 15 March 2006 he was among five men arrested in connection with the demonstration, which had been organised by al Ghurabaa. He was arrested again on 4 May at Stansted Airport for an alleged breach of bail, and charged with organising the protest without notifying police. He was bailed to appear before Bow Street Magistrates Court on 11 May. On 4 July 2006 he was convicted and fined ¬£500 with ¬£300 court costs. The following day, at an Al Ghurabaa press conference at the Al Badr centre in Leyton, Choudary claimed that the blame for the London bombings lay with the British government, and said that the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had \\"blood on his hands\\". He also urged Muslims to defend themselves against perceived attacks by \\"whatever means they have at their disposal\\", and referred to the 2 June 2006 Forest Gate raid in which Mohammed Abdul Kahar was shot in the shoulder. He encouraged Muslims not to cooperate with the police under any circumstances. Local council leader Clyde Loakes criticised Choudary's comments, stating \\"I am sure the vast majority of Waltham Forest residents do not support these views.\\" Several days later, on 9 June 2006, Choudary organised a demonstration outside the Forest Gate police station in London, to protest against the arrest of the two Forest Gate men. The men's families said that an extremist protest would \\"only give another opportunity for our community to be portrayed in a negative light\\" and sent a statement to more than twenty mosques (read to worshippers during prayers) urging them to disassociate themselves from the event. About 35 men and 15 women attended the demonstration. In September 2006, Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech on the question of the \\"reasonableness\\" of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany. In the Regensburg lecture he spoke about rationality in faith, and cited comments by the fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who, as the Pope put it, said \\"show me just what Mohamed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\\" The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan, which condemned the Pope for his comments and sought an apology from him. Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters \\"Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment.\\" The Daily Mail reported him as saying: \\"I am here [to] have a peaceful demonstration, but there may be people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out.\\" The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that \\"no substantive offences\\" were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for action to be taken against Choudary, said: \\"It is quite disgraceful. It sends out a message to Muslim extremists that we, as a country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them.\\" However, there are claims that Choudary UK law enforcement had, on multiple occasions, sufficient evidence to make an arrest. They were prevented from doing so as he was central to investigations conducted by British Security Services. He attempted to enter France to demonstrate against the French government's decision to ban the burka, but was stopped at the port of Calais. His passport was seized and he was issued documents banning him from France indefinitely. On 13 December 2013, Choudary led a march in Brick Lane, organised by the east London-based Sharia Project, demanding a ban on alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments. An East London Mosque official, speaking of the patrols, identified The Shariah Project as \\"strongly linked\\" to Anjem Choudary's banned group Al-Muhajiroun. Abu Rumaysah of The Shariah Project had predicted \\"hundreds\\" would join the demonstration, claiming that groups of Muslims would come from as far away as the Midlands to take part. In the event, only a few dozen protesters took part in the march. Choudary afterwards explained its purpose: \\"What we did is we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol, that would be 40 lashes. We were there to teach them that just because they are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and so they should be aware that just because it is not Sharia today, they can‚Äôt just do whatever they like.\\" Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies. Conviction and imprisonment On 5 August 2015, Choudary was charged with one offence under section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for inviting support of a proscribed organisation, namely Islamic State, between June 2014 and March 2015. The trial was postponed to 27 June 2016, and was expected to last no more than four weeks. Choudary was convicted on 28 July 2016. At the Old Bailey on 6 September 2016, Mr Justice Holroyde sentenced Choudary to five years and six months in prison, telling him that he had \\"crossed the line between the legitimate expression of your own views and a criminal act\\". \\"Radical preacher Anjem Choudary jailed for five years\\", BBC News . Retrieved 6 September 2016 Choudary was released from prison on 19 October 2018. Shortly after his release, it was reported that Choudary would be placed in a probation hostel in London Borough of Camden for six months where he would be required to abide by a number of conditions. Terrorist designation On 30 March 2017, Choudary was declared a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States Department of State. The designation blocks his assets and prohibits him from engaging in trade or financial transactions with US persons. On 15 October 2018, Choduary was added into the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee list of the United Nations Security Council. The designation means that each UN member state is legally obliged to freeze financial assets belonging to Choudary, prevent him from entering or transiting their countries and stop any weapons reaching him. Public reception Choudary has been largely criticised by most UK newspapers, some of which describe him as an extremist, or radical cleric or preacher. In January 2010, Guardian contributor Mehdi Hasan wrote: \\"Is Choudary an Islamic scholar whose views merit attention or consideration? No. Has he studied under leading Islamic scholars? Nope. Does he have any Islamic qualifications or credentials? None whatsoever. So what gives him the right to pontificate on Islam, British Muslims or 'the hellfire'? Or proclaim himself a 'sharia judge'?\\", and claimed that Choudary was \\"as unrepresentative of British Muslim opinion, as he is of British anti-war opinion.\\" The Conservative Party leader David Cameron said that Choudary \\"is one of those people who needs to be looked at seriously in terms of the legality of what he's saying because he strays, I think, extremely close to the line of encouraging hatred, extremism and violence.\\" Salma Yaqoob, then leader of the Respect Party, said in 2010 of Choudary: \\"He is a bigot whose goal in life is to provoke division. He engages in these provocations because he is deeply hostile to any coming together of Muslims and non-Muslims. For him, the fact that a majority of the British people ‚Äì Muslim and non-Muslim ‚Äì oppose the war in Afghanistan is not something to be celebrated, but is something to be feared.\\" Rod Liddle, writing in The Spectator, said: \\"Anjem Choudray...is one of those thick-as-mince gobby little chancers who could only possibly come from Britain.\\" Conservatives in the United States have also been critical of Choudary. Fox News host Sean Hannity called Choudary \\"one sick, miserable, evil S.O.B.\\" during a segment on his show discussing the 2011 Egyptian protests. Choudary has been denounced by mainstream Muslim groups. However, in January 2010, Jamie Bartlett, a writer for The Daily Telegraph, speculated that he might have \\"some\\" support among the minority of Muslims in the UK who could be considered to hold conservative views. The following year, Peter Oborne, defending Baroness Warsi's criticism of how British Muslims have been treated, singled out Choudary as an exception to the majority that were \\"decent people\\". Tabloid criticism of Islam4UK and Choudary since news of the proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a \\"hate preacher\\". In January 2010, appearing on the BBC's The Daily Politics, he was asked by its presenter, Andrew Neil, for his opinions on the banning of Islam4UK, before being asked to comment on his financial status, claiming that it was \\"relevant to our viewers\\". Choudary told Neil that his finances were a personal matter, and that he was \\"doing something, and I don't want to discuss that with you. I'm not on Jobseeker's allowance, but at the same time, I have family allowance, I have very firmly held views which I'm propagating at the same time.\\" Responding to the media's criticism of him, Choudary said \\"I do believe that people have been whipped up into an anti-Islam anti-Muslim frenzy.\\" Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist and the main perpetrator in the London Bridge terrorist attack on 29 November 2019, was said to be a member of his group.

Braces also fix gaps. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, overbites, open bites, deep bites, cross bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often used in conjunction with other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws.  Process  The application of braces moves the teeth as a result of force and pressure on the teeth. There are traditionally four basic elements that are used: brackets, bonding material, arch wire, and ligature elastic (also called an ‚ÄúO-ring‚Äù). The teeth move when the arch wire puts pressure on the brackets and teeth. Sometimes springs or rubber bands are used to put more force in a specific direction. Braces have constant pressure which, over time, move teeth into the desired positions. The process loosens the tooth after which new bone grows in to support the tooth in its new position. This is called bone remodeling. Bone remodeling is a biomechanical process responsible for making bones stronger in response to sustained load-bearing activity and weaker in the absence of carrying a load. Bones are made of cells called osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Two different kinds of bone resorption are possible: direct resorption, which starts from the lining cells of the alveolar bone, and indirect or retrograde resorption, which takes place when the periodontal ligament has been subjected to an excessive amount and duration of compressive stress.Robling, Alexander G., Alesha B Castillo, and Charles H. Turner, \\"Biochemical and Molecular Regulation of Bone Remodeling\\", Annual Review of Biochemical Engineering, (April 3, 2006) pp 1‚Äì12 Another important factor associated with tooth movement is bone deposition. Bone deposition occurs in the distracted periodontal ligament. Without bone deposition, the tooth will loosen and voids will occur distal to the direction of tooth movement.  Types  \\"Clear\\" braces * Traditional metal wired braces are stainless-steel and are sometimes used in combination with titanium. Traditional metal braces are the most common type of braces. These braces have a metal bracket with elastic (rubber band) ties holding the wire onto the metal brackets. The second-most common type of braces are self-ligating braces that do not require elastic ties. Instead, the wire goes through the bracket. Often with this type of braces, treatment time is reduced, there is less pain on the teeth, and fewer adjustments are required than with traditional braces. * Gold-plated stainless steel braces are often employed for patients allergic to nickel (a basic and important component of stainless steel), but may also be chosen because some people simply prefer the look of gold over the traditional silver-colored braces. * Lingual braces are a cosmetic alternative in which custom-made braces are bonded to the back of the teeth making them externally invisible. * Titanium braces resemble stainless steel braces but are lighter and just as strong. People with allergies to the nickel in steel often choose titanium braces, but they are more expensive than stainless steel braces. * Customized orthodontic treatment systems combine high-technology including 3-D imaging, treatment planning software and a robot to custom bend the wire. Customized systems such as this offer faster treatment times and more efficient results.Alana K. Saxe, DMD/Lenore J. Louie, MSc, DMD/James Mah, DDS, MSc, DMSc, \\"World Journal of Orthodontics\\", 2010;11:16‚Äì22. * Progressive, clear removable aligners may be used to gradually move teeth into their final positions. Aligners are generally not used for complex orthodontic cases, such as when extractions, jaw surgery, or palate expansion are necessary.  Fitting procedure  A patient's teeth are prepared for application of braces. Orthodontic services may be provided by any licensed dentist trained in orthodontics. In North America most orthodontic treatment is done by orthodontists, who are dentists in diagnosis and treatment of malocclusions‚Äîmalalignments of the teeth, jaws, or both. A dentist must complete 2‚Äì3 years of additional post-doctoral training to earn a specialty certificate in orthodontics. There are many general practitioners who also provide orthodontic services. The first step is to determine whether braces are suitable for the patient. The doctor consults with the patient and inspects the teeth visually. If braces are appropriate, a records appointment is set up where X-rays, molds, and impressions are made. These records are analyzed to determine the problems and proper course of action. The use of digital models is rapidly increasing in the orthodontic industry. Digital treatment starts with the creation of a three-dimensional digital model of the patient's arches. This model is produced by laser-scanning plaster models created using dental impressions. Computer-automated treatment simulation has the ability to automatically separate the gums and teeth from one another and can handle malocclusions well; this software enables clinicians to ensure, in a virtual setting, that the selected treatment will produce the optimal outcome, with minimal user input. Typical treatment times vary from six months to two and a half years depending on the complexity and types of problems. Orthognathic surgery may be required in extreme cases. About 2 weeks before the braces are applied, orthodontic spacers may be required to spread apart back teeth in order to create enough space for the bands. Teeth to be braced will have an adhesive applied to help the cement bond to the surface of the tooth. In most cases the teeth will be banded and then brackets will be added. A bracket will be applied with dental cement, and then cured with light until hardened. This process usually takes a few seconds per tooth. If required, orthodontic spacers may be inserted between the molars to make room for molar bands to be placed at a later date. Molar bands are required to ensure brackets will stick. Bands are also utilized when dental fillings or other dental work make securing a bracket to a tooth infeasible. An archwire will be threaded between the brackets and affixed with elastic or metal ligatures. Ligatures are available in a wide variety of colors, and the patient can choose which color they like. Archwires are bent, shaped, and tightened frequently to achieve the desired results. Dental braces, with a transparent power chain, removed after completion of treatment. Modern orthodontics makes frequent use of nickel-titanium archwires and temperature-sensitive materials. When cold, the archwire is limp and flexible, easily threaded between brackets of any configuration. Once heated to body temperature, the archwire will stiffen and seek to retain its shape, creating constant light force on the teeth. Brackets with hooks can be placed, or hooks can be created and affixed to the archwire to affix rubber bands to. The placement and configuration of the rubber bands will depend on the course of treatment and the individual patient. Rubber bands are made in different diameters, colors, sizes, and strengths. They are also typically available in two versions: colored or clear/opaque. The fitting process can vary between different types of braces, though there are similarities such as the initial steps of molding the teeth before application. For example, with clear braces, impressions of a patient's teeth are evaluated to create a series of trays, which fit to the patient's mouth almost like a protective mouthpiece. With some forms of braces, the brackets are placed in a special form that are customized to the patient's mouth, drastically reducing the application time. In many cases there is insufficient space in the mouth for all the teeth to fit properly. There are two main procedures to make room in these cases. One is extraction: teeth are removed to create more space. The second is expansion, in which the palate or arch is made larger by using a palatal expander. Expanders can be used with both children and adults. Since the bones of adults are already fused, expanding the palate is not possible without surgery to unfuse them. An expander can be used on an adult without surgery, but would be used to expand the dental arch, and not the palate. Sometimes children and teenage patients, and occasionally adults, are required to wear a headgear appliance as part of the primary treatment phase to keep certain teeth from moving (for more detail on headgear and facemask appliances see Orthodontic headgear). When braces put pressure on one's teeth, the periodontal membrane stretches on one side and is compressed on the other. This movement needs to be done slowly or otherwise the patient risks losing their teeth. This is why braces are worn as long as they are and adjustments are only made every so often. Braces are typically adjusted every three to six weeks. This helps shift the teeth into the correct position. When they get adjusted, the orthodontist removes the colored or metal ligatures keeping the archwire in place. The archwire is then removed, and may be replaced or modified. When the archwire has been placed back into the mouth, the patient may choose a color for the new elastic ligatures, which are then affixed to the metal brackets. The adjusting process may cause some discomfort to the patient, which is normal.  Post-treatment  Patients may need post-orthodontic surgery, such as a fiberotomy or alternatively a gum lift, to prepare their teeth for retainer use and improve the gumline contours after the braces come off. = Retainers = Hawley retainers are the most common type of retainers. This picture shows retainers for the top and bottom of the mouth. In order to prevent the teeth from moving back to their original position, retainers are worn once the treatment is complete. Retainers help in maintaining and stabilizing the position of teeth long enough to permit reorganization of the supporting structures after the active phase of orthodontic therapy. If the patient does not wear the retainer appropriately and/or for the right amount of time, the teeth may move towards their previous position. For regular braces, Hawley retainers are used. They are made of metal hooks that surround the teeth and are enclosed by an acrylic plate shaped to fit the patient's palate. For invisalign braces, an Essix retainer is used. This is similar to the regular invisalign braces; it is a clear plastic tray that is firmly fitted to the teeth, which stays in place without a plate fitted to the palate. There is also a bonded retainer where a wire is permanently bonded to the lingual side of the teeth, usually the lower teeth only. = Headgear = Headgear needs to be worn between 12‚Äì22 hours each day to be effective in correcting the overbite, typically for 12 to 18 months depending on the severity of the overbite, how much it is worn and what growth stage the patient is in. Typically the prescribed daily wear time will be between 14 and 16 hours a day and is frequently used post primary treatment phase to maintain the position of the jaw and arch. Orthodontic headgear will usually consist of three major components: Full orthodontic headgear with headcap, fitting straps, facebow and elastics # Facebow: first, the facebow (or J-Hooks) is fitted with a metal arch onto headgear tubes attached to the rear upper and lower molars. This facebow then extends out of the mouth and around the patients face. J-Hooks are different in that they hook into the patients mouth and attach directly to the brace (see photo for example of J-Hooks). # Head cap: the second component is the headcap, which typically consists of one or a number of straps fitting around the patients head. This is attached with elastic bands or springs to the facebow. Additional straps and attachments are used to ensure comfort and safety (see photo). # Attachment: the third and final component‚Äîtypically consisting of rubber bands, elastics, or springs‚Äîjoins the facebow or J-Hooks and the headcap together, providing the force to move the upper teeth, jaw backwards. The headgear application is one of the most useful appliances available to the orthodontist when looking to correct a Class II malocclusion. See more details in the section Orthodontic headgear. = Pre-finisher = The pre-finisher is molded to the patient's teeth by use of extreme pressure to the appliance by the person's jaw. The product is then worn a certain amount of time with the user applying force to the appliance in their mouth for 10 to 15 seconds at a time. The goal of the process is to increase the exercise time in applying the force to the appliance. If a person's teeth are not ready for a proper retainer the orthodontist may prescribe the use of a preformed finishing appliance such as the pre-finisher. This appliance fixes gaps between the teeth, small spaces between the upper and lower jaw, and other minor problems.  Complications and risks  Experiencing some pain following fitting and activation of fixed orthodontic braces is very common and several methods have been suggested to tackle this. The dental displacement obtained with the orthodontic appliance determines in most cases some degree of root resorption. Only in a few cases is this side effect large enough to be considered real clinical damage to the tooth. In rare cases, the teeth may fall out or have to be extracted due to root resorption.  History  = Ancient = According to scholars and historians, braces date back to ancient times. Around 400-300 BC, Hippocrates and Aristotle contemplated ways to straighten teeth and fix various dental conditions. Archaeologists have discovered numerous mummified ancient individuals with what appear to be metal bands wrapped around their teeth. Catgut, a type of cord made from the natural fibers of an animal's intestines, performed a similar role to today's orthodontic wire in closing gaps in the teeth and mouth. The Etruscans buried their dead with dental appliances in place to maintain space and prevent collapse of the teeth during the afterlife. A Roman tomb was found with a number of teeth bound with gold wire documented as a ligature wire, a small elastic wire that is used to affix the arch wire to the bracket. Even Cleopatra wore a pair. Roman philosopher and physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus first recorded the treatment of teeth by finger pressure. Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence, poor preservation of bodies, and primitive technology, little research was carried out on dental braces until around the 17th century, although dentistry was making great advancements as a profession by then. = 18th century = Fauchard from his 1728 edition of \\"The Surgical Dentist\\". Orthodontics truly began developing in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1728, French dentist Pierre Fauchard, who is often credited with inventing modern orthodontics, published a book entitled \\"The Surgeon Dentist\\" on methods of straightening teeth. Fauchard, in his practice, used a device called a \\"Bandeau\\", a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that helped expand the palate. In 1754, another French dentist, Louis Bourdet, dentist to the King of France, followed Fauchard's book with The Dentist's Art, which also dedicated a chapter to tooth alignment and application. He perfected the \\"Bandeau\\" and was the first dentist on record to recommend extraction of the premolar teeth to alleviate crowding and to improve jaw growth. = 19th century = Although teeth and palate straightening and/or pulling was used to improve alignment of remaining teeth and had been practiced since early times, orthodontics, as a science of its own, did not really exist until the mid-19th century. Several important dentists helped to advance dental braces with specific instruments and tools that allowed braces to be improved. In 1819, Delabarre introduced the wire crib, which marked the birth of contemporary orthodontics, and gum elastics were first employed by Maynard in 1843. Tucker was the first to cut rubber bands from rubber tubing in 1850. Dentist, writer, artist, and sculptor Norman William Kingsley in 1858 wrote the first article on orthodontics and in 1880, his book, Treatise on Oral Deformities, was published. A dentist named John Nutting Farrar is credited for writing two volumes entitled, A Treatise on the Irregularities of the Teeth and Their Corrections and was the first to suggest the use of mild force at timed intervals to move teeth. = 20th century = In the early 20th century, Edward Angle devised the first simple classification system for malocclusions, such as Class I, Class II, and so on. His classification system is still used today as a way for dentists to describe how crooked teeth are, what way teeth are pointing, and how teeth fit together. Angle contributed greatly to the design of orthodontic and dental appliances, making many simplifications. He founded the first school and college of orthodontics, organized the American Society of Orthodontia in 1901 which became the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) in the 1930s, and founded the first orthodontic journal in 1907. Other innovations in orthodontics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included the first textbook on orthodontics for children, published by J.J. Guilford in 1889, and the use of rubber elastics, pioneered by Calvin S. Case, along with Henry Albert Baker.

History US 222 southbound/US 422 westbound at State Hill Road exit in Wyomissing When US 222 was first designated in the 1920s, it only reached as far north as Reading, but at the time US 22 dipped down from Allentown to Reading, then west to Harrisburg. US 22 was rerouted to become a straight shot from Allentown to Harrisburg, so the roadway between Reading and Allentown became part of US 222, explaining why the highway, designated as north/south, actually runs mostly east/west between the two cities. 1939 USGS Allentown map. PA 222 was designated as US 222. By the early 1930s the road then signed as US 22 became problematic for motorists in Lebanon along the current U.S. Route 422; Reading via U.S. Routes 22 and 222; and Allentown on Hamilton Street (US 22). Pennsylvania Route 43 had been aligned as a bypass between Allentown and Harrisburg. On June 8, 1931, the American Association of State Highway Officials came to a resolution to the traffic problem, by replacing the PA 43 corridor with US 22 and the William Penn Highway name to match. The state truncated PA 43 to Susquehanna Street from Allentown to Bethlehem. US 222 replaced the former US 22 alignment from Reading to Allentown. Hamilton Street was numbered as US 222, west of Center City Allentown, where it turned north onto 15th Street. This portion of US 222 was seven-blocks long which ended at Tilghman Street (then US 22). Signs were changed to reflect the new designations on May 31, 1932, with the new route designations officially in place on June 1, 1932. The first stretch of highway between Perryville and Conowingo in Maryland that would become part of US 222 to be improved was in Perryville, where Cecil County constructed with state aid a macadam road from the Aikin station on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad south toward the Post Road (now MD 7) by 1910. Cecil County extended the macadam road to the Post Road by 1919. The highway from the Aikin railroad crossing to Port Deposit was paved as a concrete road in two sections: from the railroad to near Port Deposit by 1921 and through Port Deposit by 1923. MD 268, which was the original designation for the road between Perryville and Conowingo, was paved as a concrete road from Port Deposit to US 1 at Conowingo Dam between 1930 and 1933; the construction work included repurposing a railroad bridge across Octoraro Creek as a highway bridge. MD 268's bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was constructed between 1931 and 1934. The old highway approaching the Aikin grade crossing became MD 449. MD 268 was proposed to be widened to from US 40 to US 1 in 1934. The section of Rock Springs Road between present-day US 1 and Old Conowingo Road/Ragan Road was constructed by the state of Maryland as a macadam road by 1921. The portion of Rock Springs Road between Old Conowingo Road/Ragan Road and the Pennsylvania border was built by the state as a concrete road by 1928. US 222 was designated in Maryland by 1930, with the southern terminus at US 1 in Conowingo. MD 268 was replaced by a southern extension of US 222 from US 1 at Conowingo to US 40 (now MD 7) in Perryville in 1938. The portion of US 222 from US 40 to near Port Deposit was expanded to improve access between the U.S. Highway and United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, east of Port Deposit in 1942 and 1944. With the construction of the Lehigh Valley Thruway in the early 1950s and the relocation of US 22 to that route, US 222 was extended east along Tilghman Street to 7th Street, then north on 7th Street to the interchange with the new freeway. In the late 1950s, US 222 was realigned to a newly constructed bypass carrying U.S. Route 309 and PA Route 29, west of Allentown. From the south, US 222 left Hamilton Boulevard and turned north onto the freeway. US 222 terminated at an interchange with US 22, US 309, and PA 29 in South Whitehall Township.National Bridge Inventory, a database compiled by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, available at nationalbridges.com. Accessed June 26, 2007. The freeway, originally signed as US 309/PA 29/US 222, dropped the PA 29 designation in 1966; in 1968, US 309 was downgraded to PA 309 and US 222 was truncated to end at the current northern termini. By the 1980s, Interstate 78 became part of the freeway that occupied PA 309. US 222 in Maryland was widened and resurfaced between what is now the MD 222-MD 275--MD 824 intersection and Port Deposit in 1959 and 1960. US 222 was relocated as part of the construction of its original diamond interchange with I-95 in 1962 and 1963. The old alignment of US 222 east of its I-95 interchange became MD 824. The highway was resurfaced with bituminous concrete from MD 7 to US 40 and reconstructed and widened from US 40 to the southern MD 824 intersection in 1968 and 1969. The widening work included widening US 222's bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, which was removed and replaced between 1987 and 1989. The I-95 interchange was converted from a standard diamond to a four- ramp partial cloverleaf with all four ramps east of US 222 between 1993 and 1994. With increased development in the late 20th century the two-lane road became increasingly congested. To alleviate these problems a number of construction projects took place, most notably a four-lane Reading bypass, a four-lane expressway to connect Lancaster to Reading, and a four-lane expressway bypass around the town of Kutztown, which is situated between Reading and Allentown. Studies for a limited-access highway connecting Lancaster and Reading began in the early 1950s. In 1962, construction began on a four-lane highway between Spring Township and Bern Township that would eventually connect to US 222. After construction stopped, this stretch became known as \\"The Road to Nowhere.\\" In 1970, construction began for a freeway bypass carrying US 222 around Kutztown. The US 222 bypass of Kutztown opened on May 25, 1973, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held. In 1973, the federal government approved the relocation of homes and businesses along the path of the proposed US 222 freeway between Lancaster and Reading. In July 1977, the final section of the US 222 freeway between Lancaster and the Berks County border opened to traffic. In 1949, plans were made to build a four-lane bridge across Tulpehocken Creek at Warren Street. As part of this plan, Warren Street was to be widened from the proposed bridge to Schuylkill Avenue. This widened Warren Street was envisioned to become part of a bypass route of Reading for US 222. The bridge and widening were approved with the provision that Warren Street only be widened as far as Schuylkill Avenue as not to build a bypass route through a residential area. Construction on the bridge and the Warren Street Bypass between US 422 (Harrisburg Pike, now Penn Avenue) and PA 83 (now PA 183, Schuylkill Avenue) began in 1950. In 1953, the Park Avenue Extension (which extended Park Avenue in Wyomissing to the bypass) and the Warren Street Bypass from US 422 in Wyomissing to Tulpehocken Creek, along with the Tulpehocken Creek bridge, was finished, with a continuation of the Warren Street Bypass northeast from PA 83 to US 222 (Allentown Pike, now 5th Street Highway) proposed. Construction on the extension of the Warren Street Bypass to US 222 began in 1956 with the process of widening of the existing Warren Street. The PA 83 bridge over the bypass was built in 1957. In 1959, the Warren Street Bypass extension to US 222 was opened to traffic with the portion of Warren Street between Tulpehocken Creek and PA 83 widened to four lanes. The Warren Street Bypass included an interchange with the under- construction Reading Bypass (now US 422, West Shore Bypass) southwest of Tulpehocken Creek when it opened in 1959. On November 15, 1975, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved for US 222 to be routed to bypass Reading, with the route following US 422 along the West Shore Bypass between Lancaster Avenue and the Warren Street Bypass and the Warren Street Bypass between the West Shore Bypass and Allentown Pike. The former alignment of US 222 through Reading between the West Shore Bypass and the Warren Street Bypass received the US 222 Bus. designation. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) was planning to extend PA 145 and US 222 in Allentown. Traffic engineer Samuel D. Darrohh said that Allentown is one of few Pennsylvania cities without a traffic route going through it. After the plan was introduced, he said that motorists might be aided if US 222 were extended along Hamilton Boulevard to connect with the proposed PA 145 corridor. PennDOT originally planned the road as US 222 but AASHTO denied the extension, stating that the route \\"is not the shortest or best available route between major control points on the system, and therefore, does not adhere to the policies established under AASHTO's 'Purpose and Policy Statement for U.S. Numbered Highways'\\". In addition, the route did not meet the criteria for a business route. In 1991, it was commissioned as PA 222. PA 145 was extended south of the Lehigh Valley Thruway to the I-78/PA 309 overlap near Lanark. US 222 in Maryland used to extend down to MD 7 in Perryville. In 1972, the south end of US 222 was cut back to US 40 in Perryville, with MD 222 replacing the route along Aiken Avenue between MD 7 and US 40. AASHTO approved rolling back the southern end of the US 222 designation from US 40 in Perryville to US 1 in Conowingo at their April 1995 spring meeting. The Maryland State Highway Administration proposed and AASHTO approved the redesignation of US 222 to MD 222 from US 40 in Perryville to US 1 in Conowingo in February 1996; however, the new designation had already been enacted officially and marked publicly in 1995. In 1995, construction began on the Park Road Corridor to connect US 222/US 422 at the junction of the West Shore Bypass and Warren Street Bypass to the Road to Nowhere. Construction of the Park Road Corridor was completed in October 1998. As a result, US 222 was shifted to follow the Park Road Corridor and the Road to Nowhere to bypass the Reading area, replacing SR 3055 along the Road to Nowhere. The former alignment of US 222 that was bypassed became PA 12 along the Warren Street Bypass between US 222/US 422 and US 222 Bus. and a northern extension of US 222 Bus. along 5th Street Highway and Allentown Pike through Muhlenberg Township. In 1998, construction began on the US 222 freeway bypass of Reading between PA 724 and US 422; this section of road opened in 2000. Construction began in 2001 on the US 222 freeway between Grings Hill Road and PA 724 while construction of the section between the Lancaster County border and Grings Hill Road started in 2003. In 2004, construction was completed on the section of the US 222 freeway between Grings Hill Road and PA 724. As a result, US 222 was shifted to follow the new freeway between Grings Hill Road and US 422 and run concurrent with US 422 on the Warren Street Bypass north to the interchange with the West Shore Bypass and PA 12. The former alignment of US 222 along Lancaster Avenue became a southern extension of US 222 Bus. In June 2006, the US 222 freeway was completed between the Lancaster County border and Grings Hill Road; marking the completion of the US 222 freeway between Lancaster and Reading. In 2002, construction began on a bypass route for US 222 and PA 100 around Trexlertown. On September 29, 2005, PA 100 was rerouted to bypass the community to the west along the four-lane divided Trexlertown Bypass. US 222 was moved onto the bypass on September 28, 2007 following the extension of the bypass east to allow US 222 to bypass the community. The bypass cost $144 million to build. The former alignment of US 222 through Trexlertown along Hamilton Boulevard was designated SR 6222. In March 2013, construction began on a new bridge to carry US 222/PA 272 over the Amtrak tracks in Lancaster. The bridge project cost $26.6 million, with $12.7 million of that figure the actual construction costs of the bridge. The new bridge, which is four lanes wide and connects Lititz Pike directly with North Duke Street, opened to traffic on July 9, 2014, with the old bridge closed and later demolished. The bridge carrying US 222/PA 272 over the Amtrak line was named the Thaddeus Stevens Bridge in honor of Thaddeus Stevens, a 19th-century abolitionist and United States Representative who was from Lancaster. Concurrent with the construction of the new bridge, McGovern Avenue was converted to a two-way road between North Queen Street and North Duke Street to provide improved access to Lancaster station. In 2010, officials in Berks County pushed for PennDOT to widen a portion of the two-lane road to four lanes due to traffic and safety issues. In June 2018, plans to widen a portion of US 222 in Maidencreek Township near the PA 73 intersection to five lanes with a center left-turn lane received approval from township supervisors. Bidding for the widening project was expected to begin in spring 2019, with the project lasting for two years. On September 9, 2019, construction began on a $26 million project to widen US 222 at the PA 73 intersection along with adding roundabouts at Genesis Drive and Schaeffer Road in Maidencreek Township. In addition to the proposed widening, a roundabout was planned at the intersection with PA 662 in Richmond Township in order to reduce traffic congestion. The project, which cost $6.6 million, replaced the signalized intersection between the two routes with a roundabout, with US 222 widened to four lanes at the roundabout. Construction of the roundabout began on September 6, 2016. The roundabout opened to traffic on May 22, 2018, with all lanes at the roundabout opened on July 20, 2018. There are plans to construct a roundabout at the intersection with Schantz Road in Upper Macungie Township. Construction of this roundabout is planned to begin in February 2020 with completion by the end of 2021. Major intersections Special routes =Former Maryland truck route= U.S. Route 222 Truck was a truck bypass of US 222 from US 222 in Perryville to US 1 and US 222 in Conowingo. The signed route followed MD 275 from US 222 in Perryville north to MD 276 in Woodlawn. US 222 Truck continued north on MD 276 from Woodlawn north to US 1 west of Rising Sun. The truck route then headed west on US 1 to US 222 in Conowingo. US 222 Truck was downgraded to Maryland Route 222 Truck when US 222 became MD 222 between Perryville and Conowingo. =Reading business loop= U.S. Route 222 Business (US 222 Bus.) is a business route of US 222 located in Reading, Pennsylvania. The southern terminus is at US 222 in Cumru Township. Its northern terminus is at US 222 in Ontelaunee Township. The route begins at the US 222 freeway and heads through the southwestern suburbs of Reading as Lancaster Avenue, intersecting Pennsylvania Route 724 (PA 724) in Shillington. US 222 Bus. continues into Reading on Lancaster Avenue and intersects the northern termini of PA 625 and PA 10 before reaching an interchange with the US 422 freeway. The business route crosses the Schuylkill River and becomes Bingaman Street. US 222 Bus. turns north on 5th Street and intersects US 422 Bus. in downtown Reading and the southern terminus of PA 61 to the north of downtown. The route interchanges with the PA 12 freeway and continues north through suburban Muhlenberg Township as 5th Street Highway. US 222 Bus. reaches Temple and continues northeast to its northern terminus as Allentown Pike. US 222 Bus. is the only auxiliary route of US 222 in Pennsylvania. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Reading and Lancaster was designated US 222 while the road between Reading and Allentown was part of US 22, which ran along what was designated the William Penn Highway in 1916 and PA 3 in 1924. In the late 1920s, US 222 briefly ran concurrent with PA 41 and PA 240 at different times. PA 42 originally ran north‚Äìsouth through Reading starting in 1927. By 1930, the concurrent state route designations were removed from US 222 and US 22. US 222 entered Reading along with PA 73 along Lancaster Avenue and Bingaman Street before turning north on 9th Street along with PA 83 to end at US 22 and US 422 at Penn Street. US 22 continued north on 9th Street out of Reading and continued along Kutztown Road through Temple toward Allentown. US 120 began at US 222 at Bingaman Street and headed north on 4th Street and Center Street out of Reading. In 1931, US 22 was moved to a more direct alignment between Harrisburg and Allentown, and US 222 was extended north along the former alignment between Reading and Allentown. US 222 was shifted to use Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, and 5th Street and 5th Street Highway through the Reading area in the 1930s, running concurrent with US 122 through downtown Reading. The US 122 and PA 73 concurrencies were removed by 1966. In 1975, US 222 was rerouted to bypass Reading on the West Shore Bypass and the Warren Street Bypass, with the former alignment through the city becoming US 222 Bus. In 1998, US 222 Bus. was extended north to its current terminus following the rerouting of US 222 to a new outer bypass of Reading. The business route was extended south to its current endpoint in 2004 with the completion of the US 222 freeway south of Reading to Mohnton.

He is considered the \\"founder of entomology\\".  Family origins and early studies  Kirby was a grandson of the Suffolk topographer John Kirby (author of The Suffolk Traveller) and nephew of artist-topographer Joshua Kirby (a friend of Thomas Gainsborough's). He was also a cousin of the children's author Mrs Sarah Trimmer. His parents were William Kirby, a solicitor, and Lucy Meadows. He was born on 19 September 1759 at Witnesham, Suffolk, and studied at Ipswich School and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1781. Taking holy orders in 1782, he spent his entire working life in the peaceful seclusion of an English country parsonage at Barham in Suffolk, working there for 68 years, first as curate, then as rector from 1797. He assisted in the publication of pamphlets against Thomas Paine during the 1790s. Kirby was brought to the study of natural history by Dr Nicholas Gwynn (a friend of Boerhaave's), who introduced him to Sir James Edward Smith at Ipswich in 1791. Soon afterwards, he corresponded with Smith, seeking advice in the foundation of a natural history museum at Ipswich. Among his early friends were the naturalists Charles Sutton and Thomas Marsham, with whom he made lengthy scientific excursions, as later with William Jackson Hooker and others, becoming a leading parson-naturalist.J. Freeman, Life of The Rev William Kirby, MA, FRS, FLS, &c.; (Longman Green Brown & Longmans, London 1852). hathitrust online text His name appears on the original list of Fellows of the Linnean Society. He delivered the first of his many papers on 7 May 1793, on Three New Species of Hirudo (Linn. Trans. II, 316).  Major publications  Kirby produced his first major work, the Monographia Apum AngliaeWilliam Kirby, Monographia Apum Angliae, Ipswich, J. Raw, 1802. (Monograph on the Bees of England), in 1802. His purpose was both scientific and religious: > 'The author of Scripture is also the author of Nature: and this visible > world, by types indeed, and by symbols, declares the same truths as the > Bible does by words. To make the naturalist a religious man ‚Äì to turn his > attention to the glory of God, that he may declare his works, and in the > study of his creatures may see the loving-kindness of the Lord ‚Äì may this in > some measure be the fruit of my work‚Ä¶' (Correspondence, 1800) This, the first scientific treatise on English bees, brought him to the notice of leading entomologists in Britain and abroad. Extensive correspondence followed with scientists including Alexander Macleay, Walkenaer, Johan Christian Fabricius and Adam Afzelius. 153 of the bee species, including Lasioglossum malachurum, came from Kirby's own parish. Kirby began planning his Introduction to Entomology, a celebrated title, in 1808. This was the practical result of a friendship formed in 1805 with William Spence, of Hull, and appeared in four volumes between 1815 and 1826. Much of the work fell to Kirby owing to Spence's ill health. The book was illustrated by John Curtis. It reached its seventh edition in 1856. In 1830 he was invited to write one of the Bridgewater Treatises, his subject being The History, Habits, and Instincts of Animals (2 vols., 1835). William Kirby With Edward Sabine and J.E. Gray, Kirby prepared the natural history supplement for Captain William Parry's 1819‚Äì1820 polar expedition to seek the North-West Passage: his work formed the insect section of the Account of the Animals seen by the late Northern Expedition while within the Arctic Circle 1821. His friend W.J. Hooker established his contact with Dr John Richardson to involve him in the publication of findings from Sir John Franklin's 1st and 2nd expeditions, the insect section in the Fauna Boreali-Americana in 1837.  Institution-founding activities  In 1815, Kirby took his MA with the intention of applying for the Professorship of Botany at the University of Cambridge when it should become vacant. A dispute arose as to whether this appointment lay in the grant of the Senate or the Crown. Kirby's Tory political complexion proved a stumbling-block, and in the event John Stevens Henslow was appointed. In 1827, Kirby assisted Henry Denny in arranging the natural history specimens at Norwich Museum. In 1832, he helped to establish an early museum in Ipswich under the aegis of the town's Literary Institute, and presented a herbarium and a group of fossils. With Spence, he helped to found the Entomological Society of London in 1833, with John Westwood as Secretary, and became its Honorary President for life. On that occasion, he presented his own cabinet of insects, collected over more than 40 years, which contained many of the specimens figured in his papers. Kirby was the original President of the Ipswich Museum, 1847‚Äì50, fulfilling a project which he had advocated since 1791, and appeared with William Buckland and others at the opening ceremony. The attached lithograph by T.H. Maguire was copied from the oil portrait by Friedrich Henry Bischoff commissioned for and still displayed in the Museum. Professor Henslow succeeded him in this office. Works Besides the books already mentioned he was the author of many papers in the Transactions of the Linnean Society, the Zoological Journal and other periodicals; Strictures on Sir James Smith's Hypothesis respecting the Lilies of the Field of our Saviour and the Acanthus of Virgil (1819) and Seven Sermons on our Lords Temptations (1829).

Mager√∏ya has an area of and the highest elevation on the island is the mountain Gr√•kallfjellet. The most northern point on the island is also the northernmost point in Norway outside Svalbard: Knivskjellodden. The island features a bleak, barren, tundra-covered landscape devoid of any trees (except for a few small pockets of mountain birch), with steep cliffs along the coast, and dramatic mountainscapes in the interior. On southern Mager√∏ya, archaeologists have found evidence of settlements dating back 10,000 years. Places on Mager√∏ya The main population centre on the island is the town of Honningsv√•g.

The U.S. Highway runs from US 23, US 441, and SR 365 near Clarkesville, Georgia, north and east to Interstate 385 Business (I-385 Business) in Greenville, South Carolina. US 123 parallels I-85 to the north as it connects the Northeast Georgia cities of Clarkesville and Toccoa with the western Upstate South Carolina communities of Westminster, Seneca, Clemson, Easley, and Greenville. Route description US 123 has a length of in Georgia and in South Carolina. The U.S. Highway runs concurrently with SR 365 for its entire length in Georgia. US 123 is part of the National Highway System from its southern terminus to SR 17 and SR 184 near Toccoa and from US 76 and SC 28 in Clemson to SC 183 in Greenville. =Clarkesville to Seneca= US 123 begins at a partial interchange with US 23, US 441, and SR 365 east of Clarkesville. The interchange provides access between US 123 and those highways in the direction of Cornelia, Gainesville, and Atlanta. Access to northbound US 23, US 441, and SR 15 is provided via SR 17 (Toccoa Highway), which US 123 meets at its next intersection and with which the highway begins to run concurrently. US 123 and SR 17 head east along a four-lane divided highway through Chattahoochee National Forest. The highways cross the Habersham-Stephens county line and pass over Norfolk Southern Railway's Greenville District while passing along the north side of Currahee Mountain. At their intersection with SR 184 (Dicks Hill Parkway), SR 17 continues southeast along the divided highway toward Lavonia while US 123 turns north and joins SR 184 on Curahee Street, which forms the border of the national forest until the highways reach the city limits of Toccoa. US 123 and SR 184 gain a center turn lane and cross a Norfolk Southern rail line as they approach the downtown area. In the center of town, the highway begins to parallel the Greenville District rail line and intersects Broad Street, which carries SR 63 and SR 106 south of the intersection and SR 184 to the north. US 123 passes the Toccoa Amtrak station and intersects SR 17 Alternate (Big A Road), where the center turn lane ends. The highway passes Toccoa Airport and veers away from the railroad on the eastern edge of the city. US 123 passes by the historic site Travelers Rest before crossing the Tugaloo River branch of Lake Hartwell into Oconee County, South Carolina. The highway parallels the left bank of the lake to the mouth of the Chauga River, then curves north and crosses over the Greenville District before entering the town of Westminster, where the highway intersects US 76 (North Avenue). US 123 and US 76 head east on Windsor Street, meet the western end of SC 183 (Westminster Highway), and temporarily expand to a four-lane divided highway as they pass under the rail line. The U.S. Highways reduce to two lanes to pass through downtown Westminster, which includes the historic Southern Railway Passenger Station. At the east end of downtown, US 123 and US 76 veer onto Main Street, which becomes a four-lane road with center turn lane. The highways meet the northern end of SC 24 (West Oak Highway) in the eastern part of town. The U.S. Highways' name changes to Sandifer Boulevard as they leave Westminster and expand to a four-lane divided highway. The highways have a partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 11 (Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway) and cross to the north side of the railroad, then become a four-lane road with center turn lane as they enter the town of Seneca. US 123 and US 76 intersect SC 28 (Blue Ridge Boulevard) and SC 59 (1st North Street), which head north and south, respectively, from the intersection. US 123, US 76, and SC 28 head east concurrently along the north side of Seneca south of Lake Keowee. The highways have a partial cloverleaf interchange with Pine Street before intersecting SC 130, which heads southwest along 1st North Street and northeast along Rochester Highway. =Seneca to Greenville= US 123, US 76, and SC 28 cross the railroad and continue east from Seneca as Clemson Boulevard, a four-lane divided highway. The highways begin to closely parallel the railroad shortly before they meet the western end of SC 93 (Pendleton Road), which provides access to Clemson University. The highways continue as Tiger Boulevard and, after crossing the Keowee River branch of Lake Hartwell into Pickens County, Calhoun Memorial Highway. In the town of Clemson, the three highways intersect SC 133 (College Avenue) before US 76 and SC 28 turn south onto Anderson Highway. US 123 veers away from the railroad and becomes a freeway at its diamond interchange with SC 93 (Old Greenville Highway). The U.S. Highway has diamond interchanges at Issaqueena Trail, at 18 Mile Road on the edge of the town of Central, and at Ruhamah Road (identified as ROAD 17 on directional signs), US 178 (Moorefield Memorial Highway), and Cartee Road around the town of Liberty. US 123 enters the city of Easley and has a partial interchange with US 123 Connector (Ross Avenue), which leads west to SC 93; there is no access from northbound US 123 to the westbound connector route. The freeway ends at the highway's diamond interchange with SC 135 (Pendleton Street), which leads to SC 8. US 123 continues east as a four-lane road with center turn lane to its directional intersection with the eastern end of SC 93 (Greenville Road), where the U.S. Highway becomes a divided highway again and briefly parallels the Greenville District rail line. The highway has a trumpet interchange with SC 153 on the eastern edge of Easley. US 123 has a directional intersection with the western end of SC 124 (Old Easley Highway) at Greenville-Pickens Speedway before the highway crosses the Saluda River into Greenville County. The U.S. Highway continues as New Easley Road along the edge of the Greenville suburb of Parker, then becomes Easley Bridge Road at its diamond interchange with US 25 (White Horse Road). US 123 reduces to a four-lane undivided highway, crosses over CSX's Belton Subdivision, and enters the city of Greenville just west of its intersection with SC 124 (Pendleton Street) and becomes Academy Street. The highway has a grade crossing with a Norfolk Southern rail line and crosses over the Reedy River and the Swamp Rabbit Trail (formerly Greenville and Northern Railway) on the western edge of downtown Greenville. US 123 intersects both directions of SC 183--Buncombe Street eastbound and College Street westbound--adjacent to the Greenville County Museum of Art before curving east to intersect Main Street and US 29 (Church Street). The highway then curves south and reaches its northern terminus at I-385 Business (North Street) a short distance west of the northern terminus of I-385 adjacent to the Bon Secours Wellness Arena. =National Highway System= The entire length of US 123 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.

The donor hand usually comes from a brain-dead donor and is transplanted to a recipient who has lost one or both hands/arms. Most hand transplants to date have been performed on below elbow amputees, although above elbow transplants are gaining popularity. Hand transplants were the first of a new category of transplants where multiple organs are transplanted as a single functional unit, now termed \\"Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation\\" or VCA. The operation is quite extensive and typically lasts from 8 to 12 hours. By comparison, a typical heart transplant operation lasts 6 to 8 hours. Surgeons usually connect the bones first, followed by tendons, arteries, nerves, veins, and skin. The recipient of a hand transplant needs to take immunosuppressive drugs similar to other transplants such as kidneys or livers, as the body's natural immune system will try to reject, or destroy, the hand. These drugs cause the recipient to have a weaker immune system which may lead to an increased risk of infections and some cancers. There have been many advances in solid organ transplantation over the years that have made these medications quite tolerable. After the transplant, there is a period of extensive hand therapy/rehabilitation which helps the recipients regain function of the transplanted hand. Those patients who are dedicated to taking the medications and performing the physical therapy following a hand transplant have had remarkable success in regaining function of the new hands/arms. History A hand transplant was performed in Ecuador in 1964, but the patient suffered from transplant rejection after only two weeks due to the primitive nature of the immune-suppressing medications at that time. The first short-term success in human hand transplant occurred with New Zealander Clint Hallam who had lost his hand in an accident while in prison. The operation was performed on September 23, 1998, in Lyon, France by a team assembled from different countries around the world led by French Professor Jean-Michel Dubernard, including Prof Nadey Hakim, who represented the UK. A microsurgeon on the team, Earl Owen from Australia, was privy to the detailed basic research, much of it unpublished, that had been carefully gathered by the team in Louisville. After the operation, Hallam wasn't comfortable with the idea of his transplanted hand and failed to follow the prescribed post-operative drug and physiotherapy regime. His inaccurate expectations became a vivid example of the necessity of a fully committed team of caregivers, including psychologists, that can correctly select and prepare the potential transplant recipients for the lengthy and difficult recovery and for the modest functional restoration of a transplanted hand to be expected. Hallam's transplanted hand was removed at his request by the transplant surgeon Nadey Hakim on February 2, 2001, following another episode of rejection. The first hand transplant to achieve prolonged success was directed by a team of Kleinert Kutz Hand Care surgeons including Warren C. Breidenbach, Tsu-Min Tsai, Luis Scheker, Steven McCabe, Amitava Gupta, Russell Shatford, William O'Neill, Martin Favetto and Michael Moskal in cooperation with the Christine M. Kleinert Institute, Jewish Hospital and the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. The procedure was performed on New Jersey native Matthew Scott on January 14, 1999. Scott had lost his hand in a fireworks accident at age 24. Later in 1999, the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team asked him to do the honors of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. The Louisville group went on to perform the first five hand transplants in the United States and have performed 12 hand transplants in ten recipients as of 2016. In contrast to the earlier attempts at hand transplantation, the Louisville group had performed extensive basic science research and feasibility studies for many years prior to their first clinical procedure (for example, Shirbacheh et al., 1998). There was also considerable transparency and institutional review board oversight involved in the screening and selection of prospective patients. In March 2000, a team of surgeons at the University of Innsbruck in Austria began a series of three bilateral hand transplants over six years. The first was an Austrian police officer who had lost both hands attempting to defuse a bomb. He has completed an around-the-world solo motorcycle trip using his transplanted hands. University of Louisville doctors also performed a successful hand transplant on Michigan native Jerry Fisher in February 2001, and Michigan resident David Savage in 2006. On January 14, 2004, the team of Professor Jean-Michel Dubernard (Edouard-Herriot Hospital, France) declared a five-year-old double hand transplant a success. The lessons learned in this case, and in the 26 other hand transplants (6 double) which occurred between 2000 and 2005, gave encouragement to other transplant operations of such organs as the face, abdominal wall and larynx. On May 4, 2009 Jeff Kepner, a 57-year-old Augusta, Georgia resident underwent the first double hand transplant in the United States at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center by a team led by W.P. Andrew Lee, who also had been performing careful basic research on such transplants for many years. A CNN story on his follow up demonstrated the limited functional restoration to be expected, particularly following bilateral transplantation. On February 18, 2010, the first female in the United States underwent hand transplantation at Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. The procedure was performed by surgeons from The Hand Center of San Antonio and US Air Force. On June 22, 2010, a Polish soldier received two new hands from a female donor, after losing them three years earlier while saving a young recruit from a bomb. On March 8, 2011, 26-year- old Emily Fennell underwent an 18-hour surgery to attach a right hand. This was performed in the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. March 12, 2011 Linda Lu became the recipient of a hand transplant, performed at Emory University Hospital, from a donor Leslie Sullivent. In the fall of 2011, 28-year-old Lindsay Ess received a double hand transplant at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in an 11 1/2 hour surgery. On December 27, 2012, 51-year-old Mark Cahill received a right hand transplant at Leeds General Infirmary in the UK. The recipient's hand was removed during the same 8 hour operation, reportedly allowing very accurate restoration of nerve structures, believed to be an international first. On February 27, 2013, 38-year-old Eskandar Moghaddami received hand transplant surgery by the 15th of Khordad Hospital plastic surgery team in Tehran, Iran. On January 13, 2015, doctors at the Kochi-based Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre (AIMS) successfully conducted India's first hand transplant. A 30-year-old man, who had lost both his hands in a train accident, received the hands of a 24-year-old accident victim. On July 28, 2015, doctors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia performed the first successful bilateral hand transplant on a child. At the age of 2, Zion Harvey lost his hands and feet to a life-threatening infection. Six years later, at age 8, he had both of his hands replaced in a double hand transplant. On August 2, 2016, the reconstructive transplantation team at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, performed the first intergender hand transplantation in India on a 16 year old boy who had lost both his hands in an electrocution injury. The donor was a 54 year old lady who was brain dead following a road traffic accident. On October 26, 2016, the Director of hand transplantation at UCLA, Dr. Kodi Azari, and his team, performed a hand transplant on 51-year-old entertainment executive from Los Angeles, Jonathan Koch at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Koch underwent a 17-hour procedure to replace his left hand, which he lost to a mysterious, life-threatening illness that struck him in January 2015. On June 23, 2015, Koch had the amputation surgery, also performed by Dr. Kodi Azari, which was designed to prep him to receive a transplanted limb. This included severing the left hand closer to the wrist than the elbow. Azari kept all the nerves and tendons long and extended, which would give him plenty to work with later. Then he sutured them together and attached them to the stump of bone to keep them from retracting. This is the first known hand transplant case in which the hand was amputated in preparation for a hand transplant, as opposed to previous hand transplant patients who have undergone typical amputation surgeries. Azari's theory about prepping the hand for a transplant during the initial amputation surgery would later be supported by Koch when he was able to move his thumb only two hours after he woke up from the 17-hour transplant surgery and move his entire hand only two days after surgery.  Long-term functionality  The long-term functionality varies patient to patient and is affected by several factors including level of amputation and transplant and participation in occupational therapy post hand transplant surgery. Hand transplant recipient Jonathan Koch was able to pick up a napkin and a tennis ball with his newly transplanted hand 7 days after his 17-hour surgery and by day 9, he was able to pick up a bottle of water and take a drink. 3 months after surgery, Koch was able to use his transplanted hand to tie his shoe. Survival rates Although the one-year survival rate of transplanted hands has been excellent at institutions that are fully committed to the procedure, the number of hand transplants performed after 2008 has been small due to drug-related side effects, uncertain long-term outcome, and the high costs of surgery, rehabilitation and immunosuppression. Programs =United States= The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Hand and Arm Transplant Program was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board in July 2011. This is one of only two programs in the United States approved to perform hand/arm transplants using an immunomodulatory protocol, which enables patients to take one drug (instead of three) after the transplant to maintain the hand or arm. The program is funded by the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM) to transplant up to six Wounded Warriors or civilians who have a hand or arm amputation on one or both sides. The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine Hand Transplant Program is located in Springfield, Illinois. The program was officially launched in January 2014 after receiving IRB approval and grant funding to transplant five patients, unilateral or bilateral, at minimal cost to the patients. The UCLA Hand Transplant Program, located in Los Angeles, California, was launched July 28, 2010. At the time, it was the only one on the West Coast and one of only four in the country. =United Kingdom= In 2016 it was announced that NHS patients in England were to become some of the first in the world to benefit from publicly funded pioneering hand and upper arm transplants delivered by a specialist team at Leeds General Infirmary.

Redline refers to the maximum engine speed at which an internal combustion engine or traction motor and its components are designed to operate without causing damage to the components themselves or other parts of the engine. The redline of an engine depends on various factors such as stroke, mass of the components, displacement, composition of components, and balance of components. The word is also used as a verb, meaning to ride or drive an automotive vehicle at its maximum engine speed. Variation of redline The acceleration, or rate of change in piston velocity, is the limiting factor. The piston acceleration is directly proportional to the magnitude of the G-forces experienced by the piston- connecting rod assembly. As long as the G-forces acting on the piston- connecting rod assembly multiplied by their own mass is less than the compressive and tensile strengths of the materials they are constructed from and as long as it does not exceed the bearing load limits, the engine can safely rev without succumbing to physical or structural failure. Redlines vary anywhere from a few hundred revolutions per minute (rpm) (in very large engines such as those in trains and generators) to more than 10,000 rpm (in smaller, usually high-performance engines such as motorcycles, some sports cars, and pistonless rotary engines). Diesel engines normally have lower redlines than comparatively sized gasoline engines, largely because of fuel- atomization limitations. Gasoline automobile engines typically will have a redline at around 5500 to 7000 rpm. The Gordon Murray Automotive T.50 has the highest redline of a piston-engine road car rated at 12,100 rpm. The Renesis in the Mazda RX-8 has the highest redline of a production rotary-engine road car rated at 9000 rpm. In contrast, some older OHV engines had redlines as low as 4800 rpm, mostly due to the engines being designed and built for low-end power and economy during the late 1960s all the way to the early 1990s. One main reason OHV engines have lower redlines is valve float. At high speeds, the valve spring simply cannot keep the tappet or roller on the camshaft. After the valve opens, the valve spring does not have enough force to push the mass of the rocker arm, push rod, and lifter down on the cam before the next combustion cycle. Overhead cam engines eliminate many of the components, and moving mass, used on OHV engines. Lower redlines, however, do not necessarily mean low performance, as some skeptics sometimes assume. For example, a Supercharged Buick 3800 V6 with a redline anywhere from 5500 to 6000 has a torque curve that peaks at 2600‚Äì3600 rpm, yet the engine is a strong performer from takeoff all the way through to the redline. Motorcycle engines can have even higher redlines because of their comparatively lower reciprocating mass. For example, the 1986‚Äì1996 Honda CBR250RR has a redline of about 19,000 rpm. (Though due to regulations in Japanese motorcycle manufacturing this was later lowered to 18,000). Higher yet is the redline of a modern Formula One car. Regulations in 2010 limit the maximum engine rotation to 18,000 rpm , but during the 2006 season, engine speeds reached over 20,000 rpm on the Cosworth engine. Rev limiter and implementation The actual term redline comes from the red bars that are displayed on tachometers in cars starting at the rpm that denotes the redline for the specific engine. Operating an engine in this area is known as redlining. Straying into this area usually does not mean instant engine failure, but may increase the chances of damaging the engine. Most modern cars have computer systems that prevent the engine from straying too far into the redline by cutting fuel flow through the fuel injectors/fuel rail (in a direct-injected engine)/carburetor or by disabling the ignition system until the engine drops to a safer operating speed. This device is known as a rev limiter and is usually set to an RPM value at redline or a few hundred RPM above. Most Electronic Control Units (ECUs) of automatic transmission cars will upshift before the engine hits the redline even with maximum acceleration (The ECU in a sports car's automatic transmission will allow the engine to go nearer the redline or hit the redline before upshifting). If manual override is used, the engine may go past redline for a brief amount of time before the ECU will cut power to pull it back or auto- upshift. When the car is in top gear and the engine is in redline (due to high speed), the ECU will cut fuel to the engine, forcing it to decelerate until the engine begins operating below the redline at which point it will release fuel back to the engine, allowing it to operate once again. However, even with these electronic protection systems, a car is not prevented from redlining through inadvertent gear engagement. If a driver accidentally selects a lower gear when trying to shift up or selects a lower gear than intended while shifting down (as in a motorbike sequential manual transmission), the engine will be forced to rapidly rev-up to match the speed of the drivetrain. If this happens while the engine is at high rpms, it may dramatically exceed the redline. For example, if the operator is driving close to redline in 3rd gear and attempts to shift to 4th gear but unintentionally puts the car in 2nd by mistake, the transmission will be spinning much faster than the engine, and when the clutch is released the engine's rpm will increase rapidly. It will lead to a rough and very noticeable engine braking, and likely engine damage. This is often known as a \\"money shift\\" because of the likelihood of engine damage and the expense of fixing the engine.

His best known work, American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman, celebrated the achievements of several 19th-century American authors and had a profound impact on a generation of scholars. It also established American Renaissance as the common term to refer to American literature of the mid-nineteenth century. Matthiessen was known for his support of liberal causes and progressive politics. His contributions to the Harvard University community have been memorialized in several ways, including an endowed visiting professorship. Early life and education Matthiessen was born in Pasadena, California on February 19, 1902. He was the fourth of four children born to Frederick William Matthiessen (1868‚Äì1948) and Lucy Orne Pratt (1866). The family's three older siblings included Frederick William (1894), George Dwight (1897) and Lucy Orne (1898).The Ancestry and the Descendants of John Pratt of Hartford, Conn Retrieved December 21, 2013 In Pasadena he was a student at Polytechnic School. Following the separation of his parents, he relocated with his mother to his paternal grandparents home in LaSalle, Illinois. His grandfather, Frederick William Matthiessen, was an industrial leader in zinc production and a successful manufacturer of clocks and machine tools. He also served as mayor of Lasalle for ten years. The grandson completed his secondary education at Hackley School, in Tarrytown, New York. In 1923, Matthiessen graduated from Yale University, where he was managing editor of the Yale Daily News, editor of the Yale Literary Magazine and a member of Skull and Bones.Yale University obituary mssa.library.yale.edu, Retrieved December 21, 2013 As the recipient of the university's Deforest Prize, he titled his oration, \\"Servants of the Devil\\", in which he proclaimed Yale's administration to be an \\"autocracy, ruled by a Corporation out of touch with college life and allied with big business\\".Max Lerner: Pilgrim in the Promised Land, Retrieved December 21, 2013 In his final year as a Yale undergraduate, he received the Alpheus Henry Snow Prize, awarded to the senior \\"who through the combination of intellectual achievement, character and personality, shall be adjudged by the faculty to have done the most for Yale by inspiring in classmates an admiration and love for the best traditions of high scholarship\\". Helen Bayne Knapp, Matthiessen, and Russell Cheney: photo taken in Cheney's garden, 1925 He studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, earning a B.Litt. in 1925. At Harvard University, he quickly completed his M.A. in 1926 and Ph.D. degree in 1927. He then returned to Yale to teach for two years, before beginning a distinguished teaching career at Harvard. F. O. Matthiessen tablet at Eliot House, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA Scholarly work Matthiessen was an American studies scholar and literary critic at Harvard University, and chaired its undergraduate program in history and literature. He wrote and edited landmark works of scholarship on T. S. Eliot, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the James family (Alice James, Henry James, Henry James Sr., and William James), Sarah Orne Jewett, Sinclair Lewis, Herman Melville, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman. His best-known book, American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman (1941), discusses the flowering of literary culture in the middle of the American 19th century, with Emerson, Thoreau, Melville, Whitman and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Its focus was the period roughly from 1850 to 1855 in which all these writers but Emerson published what would, by Matthiessen's time, come to be thought of as their masterpieces: Melville's Moby-Dick, multiple editions of Whitman's Leaves of Grass, Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter and The House of the Seven Gables, and Thoreau's Walden. The mid-19th century in American literature is commonly called the American Renaissance because of the influence of this work on later literary history and criticism. In 2003 The New York Times said that the book \\"virtually created the field of American literature.\\" Originally Matthiessen planned to include Edgar Allan Poe in the book, but found that Poe did not fit in the scheme of the book.Kermit Vanderbilt, American Literature and the Academy: The Roots, Growth, and Maturity of a Profession., p. 501. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986. He wrote the chapter on Poe for the Literary History of the United States (LHUS, 1948), but \\"some of the editors missed the usual Matthiessen touch of brilliance and subtlety.\\"Vanderbilt 1986, p. 502 Kermit Vanderbilt suggests that because Matthiessen was \\"not able to pull together the related strands\\" between Poe and the writers of American Renaissance, the chapter is \\"markedly old-fashioned.\\"Vanderbilt 1986, 523 Matthiessen edited The Oxford Book of American Verse, published in 1950, an anthology of American poetry of major importance which contributed significantly to the propagation of American modernist poetry in the 1950s and 1960s. Matthiessen was one of earliest scholars associated with the Salzburg Global Seminar. In July 1947, he gave the inaugural lecture, stating: > Our age has had no escape from an awareness of history. Much of that history > has been hard and full of suffering. But now we have the luxury of an > historical awareness of another sort, of an occasion not of anxiety but of > promise. We may speak without exaggeration of this occasion as historic, > since we have come here to enact anew the chief function of culture and > humanism, to bring man again into communication with man.Salzburg Global > Seminar History www.salzburgglobal.org, Retrieved September 5, 2013 Along with John Crowe Ransom and Lionel Trilling, in 1948, Matthiessen was one of the founders of the Kenyon School of English.Kenyon School of English www.kenyonhistory.net, Retrieved September 5, 2013 Politics Matthiessen's politics were left-wing and socialist. Already financially secure, he donated an inheritance he received in the late 1940s to his friend, Marxist economist Paul Sweezy. Sweezy used the money, totalling almost $15,000, to found a new journal, which became the Monthly Review. On the Harvard campus, Matthiessen was a visible and active supporter of progressive causes. In May 1940 he was elected president of the Harvard Teachers Union, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor. The Harvard Crimson reported his inaugural address in which Matthiessen quoted the campus union's constitution: \\"In affiliating with the organized labor movement, we express our desire to contribute to and receive support from this powerful progressive force; to reduce the segregation of teachers from the rest of the workers ...and increase thereby the sense of common purpose among them; and in particular to cooperate in this field in the advancement of education and resistance to all reaction.\\"Matthiessen Heads Union The Harvard Crimson, Retrieved March 22, 2013 Matthiessen seconded the nomination of the Progressive Party presidential candidate, Henry Wallace, at the party's convention in Philadelphia in 1948.Memories of the Moderns, pg. 218, Retrieved December 21, 2013 Reflective of the emerging McCarthyism surveillance of left-wing university academics, he was mentioned as an activist in Boston area so-called \\"Communist front groups\\" by Herbert Philbrick. Personal life Matthiessen was known to his friends as \\"Matty\\". As a gay man in the 1930s and 1940s, he chose to remain in the closet throughout his professional career, if not in his personal life - although traces of homoerotic concern are apparent in his writings.\\"American Renaissance (New York: Oxford University Press, 1941), p. 431\\". In 2009, a statement from Harvard University said that Matthiessen \\"stands out as an unusual example of a gay man who lived his sexuality as an 'open secret' in the mid-20th century.\\" He had a two-decade-long romantic relationship with the painter Russell Cheney, twenty years his senior. Like Matthiessen's family, Cheney's was prominent in business, being among America's leading silk producers. In a 1925 letter to Cheney, Matthiessen wrote about trusting friends with the knowledge of their relationship, rather than the world at large; in planning to spend his life with Cheney, Matthiessen went as far as asking his cohort in the Yale secret society Skull and Bones to approve of their partnership.Levin, Harry. \\"The Private Life of F. O. Matthiessen.\\" New York Review of Books 25:12 (July 20, 1978), pp. 42‚Äì46 (abstract online; full text for subscribers only). With Cheney having encouraged Matthiessen's interest in Whitman, it has been argued that American Renaissance was \\"the ultimate expression of Matthiessen's love for Cheney and a secret celebration of the gay artist.\\" Throughout his teaching career at Harvard, Matthiessen maintained a residence in either Cambridge or Boston. However, the couple often retreated to their shared cottage in Kittery, Maine. Russell Cheney died in July 1945. Death Matthiessen committed suicide in 1950 by jumping from a 12th floor window of the Hotel Manger in Boston. He had been hospitalized once for a nervous breakdown in 1938‚Äì39. He also continued to be deeply affected by Russell Cheney's death. He spent the evening before his death at the home of his friend and colleague, Kenneth Murdock, Harvard's Higginson Professor of English Literature. In a note left in the hotel room, Matthiessen wrote, \\"I am depressed over world conditions. I am a Christian and a Socialist. I am against any order which interferes with that objective.\\" Commentators have speculated on the impact of the escalating Red Scare on his state of mind. He was being targeted by anti-communist forces that would soon be exploited by Senator Joseph McCarthy, and inquiries by the House Un- American Activities Committee into his politics may have been a contributing factor in his suicide. In an article subsection titled \\"Dupes and Fellow Travelers Dress Up Communist Fronts\\" in the April 4, 1949 edition of Life magazine, he had been pictured among fifty prominent academics, scientists, clergy and writers, who also included Albert Einstein, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman, Langston Hughes, Norman Mailer and fellow Harvard professors, Kirtley Mather, Corliss Lamont and Ralph Barton Perry. Writing in 1958, Eric Jacobsen referred to Matthiessen's death as \\"hastened by forces whose activities earned for themselves the sobriquet un-American which they sought so assiduously to fasten on others\\". However, in 1978, Harry Levin was more skeptical, saying only that \\"spokesmen for the Communist Party, to which he had never belonged, loudly signalized his suicide as a political gesture\\". Matthiessen was buried at Springfield Cemetery in Springfield, Massachusetts.Find A Grave - F. O. Matthiessen Retrieved April 29, 2013 Legacy Matthiessen's contribution to the critical celebration of 19th-century American literature is considered formative and enduring. Along with several other scholars, he is regarded as a contributor to the creation of American studies as a recognized academic discipline. His personal story, academic contributions, political activism and early death had a lasting impact on a circle of scholars and writers. Their sense of loss and struggle to understand his suicide can be found in two novels with central figures inspired by Matthiessen, May Sarton's Faithful are the Wounds (1955) and Mark Merlis's American Studies (1994).Baltimore Sun Retrieved November 25, 2013 His stature and legacy as a member of the Harvard community has been memorialized in several ways by the university. He was the first Senior Tutor at Eliot House, one of Harvard College's undergraduate residential houses. Approaching seventy years after his death, Matthiessen's suite at Eliot House remains preserved as the F. O. Matthiessen Room, housing personal manuscripts and 1700 volumes of his library available for scholarly research by permission. Eliot House also hosts an annual Matthiessen Dinner with a guest speaker. In 2009, Harvard established an endowed chair in LGBT studies called the F. O. Matthiessen Visiting Professorship of Gender and Sexuality.

It currently runs for from Huntington, Indiana, at US 24 to New Castle, Pennsylvania, at US 422 Business (US 422 Bus.) and Pennsylvania Route 18 (PA 18). It goes through the cities of Canfield, Ohio, Akron, Ohio, and Findlay, Ohio. In Northeast Ohio, US 224 is located a short distance north of the Western Reserve's southern boundary. Route description =Indiana= US 224 at its intersection with SR 5 south From the western terminus US 224 heads southeast concurrent with State Road 5 (SR 5). US 224 and SR 5 heads through downtown Huntington as one-way streets, with eastbound on Cherry Street and State Street and westbound on Warren Street. From downtown US 224 and SR 5 head southeast then outside of downtown SR 5 heads due south and US 224 heads east. US 224 passes through Markle where US 224 has an interchange with Interstate 69 (I-69) and intersections with both SR 116 and SR 3\\\\. US 224 heads east towards Decatur passing through intersections with SR 301 and SR 1\\\\. In Decatur US 224 has a short concurrency with US 27 and US 33\\\\. US 224 heads east from Decatur towards Ohio passing through a short concurrency with SR 101. The only section of U.S. Route 224 in Indiana that is included in the National Highway System is the part concurrent with US 27 and US 33. Traffic reports from the Indiana Department of Transportation in 2010 showed that the lowest traffic levels were the 2,420 vehicles and 670 commercial vehicles using the highway daily near the Ohio state line; the highest traffic levels were the 21,680 vehicles and 1,690 commercial vehicles traveling along the section of US 224 that is concurrent with US 27 and US 33. =Ohio= West of its concurrency with US 42 near Lodi, US 224 is a rural arterial highway, mostly two lanes, across western Ohio. It runs roughly parallel to the former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from its westerly US 42 junction to Tiffin, a city around which it sweeps to the south with intersections at various state highways that radiate out from downtown. US 224 passes through a commercial strip on the south side of Willard, and goes through downtown Findlay and Ottawa, but it otherwise specializes in small towns along its course across northwest Ohio. It crosses US 250 east of Greenwich; State Route 4 (SR 4), a major north‚Äìsouth route, at Attica; US 23 south of Fostoria, and I-75 in Findlay, and has brief concurrences with US 127 and US 30 near Van Wert. It crosses the Ashland Railway just east of Willard, the Norfolk Southern Railway at Attica, CSX Transportation near US 23, in Findlay, and in Ottawa, and the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad west of Van Wert. East of Lodi, US 224 meets the western terminus of I-76, with which it forms a concurrency. It is in this area, US 224 enters the Connecticut Western Reserve. Less than a mile later, both routes intersect with I-71. US 224 continues along with I-76 to Akron. Here, I-76 exits and heads north. Continuing on US 224, the route runs concurrently with I-277, a short auxiliary highway running through southern Akron. I-277 quickly ends, leaving US 224 to continue into a heavily wooded area. The highway then intersects with SR 43, SR 44, SR 169, SR 225, SR 24, SR 45 and SR 46\\\\. Shortly after crossing over SR 11, US 224 enters Boardman Township in Mahoning County. This stretch of US 224, through Canfield, Boardman and Poland, is known for its chronic congestion. The original routing of US 224 through the village of Poland turned southeast on Main Street (formerly SR 90, now SR 170) to Riverside Drive, then north on Riverside Drive to the current alignment. In 1954 a bridge was built across Yellow Creek and a new road was constructed from Main Street to Riverside Drive, including an intersection with Water Street (SR 616). As US 224 leaves the village of Poland it continues through rural terrain as it heads towards Pennsylvania. =Pennsylvania= The eastern terminus of US 224 at US 422 Bus. and PA 18 in New Castle, Pennsylvania US 224 crosses into Mahoning Township in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania and becomes West State Street, a two-lane undivided road. The road heads through wooded areas with some homes and commercial establishments, heading to the east- southeast. The route curves to the northeast in Peanut and passes over Norfolk Southern's Youngstown Line, coming to an intersection with PA 551. Here, PA 551 turns northeast to form a concurrency with US 224\\\\. The road heads through wooded areas and crosses the Mahoning River and CSX's New Castle Subdivision railroad line. PA 551 splits from US 224 by heading north on North Edinburg Road, with US 224 continuing into wooded areas with some farm fields. The road turns to the southeast and enters Union Township. The route continues through wooded areas with some farmland and homes, passing to the south of New Castle Municipal Airport and heading through the community of Parkstown. US 224 heads into businesses areas, gaining a second lane westbound before widening into a six-lane divided highway as it comes to an interchange with I-376/US 422. Past this interchange, the road becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and passes through a mix of residences and businesses, running through the community of Oakwood. The route heads into the city of New Castle and passes through wooded areas of development, gaining a second westbound lane and coming to an intersection with US 422 Business. At this point, US 422 Business turns east to join US 224 on four-lane divided West Falls Street, passing more development and crossing over a New Castle Industrial Railroad line and the Shenango River. The road heads to the east and continues through commercial areas. US 224 ends at an intersection with PA 18, at which point US 422 Business turns south to join that route. History When US 224 was commissioned in Indiana in 1934, it replaced State Road 16 (SR 16), from Huntington to the Ohio state line. Although US 224 is only in Pennsylvania for 10 miles, the eastern terminus has changed several times since 1933, ending at various points in New Castle, Pennsylvania or in adjacent Union Township west of the city. The eastern terminus has been moved five times (1936, 1947, 1974, 1977, 2008), the most notable of which was in the 1970s when the New Castle Bypass opened in 1974 and the state extended US 224 through the city and into Shenango Township at the eastern terminus of the bypass, taking over US 422's old alignment after that highway was moved to the bypass. The route was truncated back at the current interchange with US 422 and I-376 in 1977 while the old alignment through New Castle was replaced by Business US 422\\\\. This would be the case until March 20, 2008, when US 224 was officially extended to PA 18 inside the New Castle city limits with the placement of new signs. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) requested approval from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for the extension in August 2007. and received it the following month. The extension of US 224 marked the second extension of a major highway into downtown New Castle in a little more than a year, as Pennsylvania Route 65 was extended a mile from its previous terminus with Business 422 to the PA 108/PA 168 concurrency in February 2007. Future Due to a higher-than- average number of crash-related injuries and fatalities along a stretch of US 224 in Medina County, Ohio, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) recommended converting three intersections, Vandemark, Westfield and Leroy roads, to restricted crossing U-turns. The highest-priority intersection, with Westfield Road in Westfield Township, was awarded $578,000 in ODOT funding and began construction in May 2019 and finished by the end of Summer 2019.

US 129 currently runs for from an intersection with US 19/US 27 ALT/US 98 in Chiefland, Florida, to an interchange with Interstate 40 (I-40) in Knoxville, Tennessee. It passes through the states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. It goes through the cities of Macon, Athens, Gainesville, and Knoxville. The section that is located beside Deals Gap on the North Carolina‚ÄìTennessee state line is known as or from its winding course. It is a popular motorcycle and sports car destination. This segment runs from Tab Cat Creek to Deals Gap and has about 318 curves in this 11 mile section. Route description =Florida= A US 129 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 129 begins at US 19/US 27 Alternate/US 98 in Chiefland, Florida, along hidden SR 47 until it reaches SR 26 in Trenton. From there, the road is signed along hidden SR 49\\\\. It then moves west, briefly overlapping US 27 (hidden SR 20) and heads north again in Branford, before that road intersects SR 349, which used to also serve as US 129 Alternate. From here, it intersects with US 90/SR 51 in Live Oak, taking SR 51 as the new hidden state road, then meets I-10 at exit 283, and later I-75 at exit 451. During a concurrency with US 41 in Jasper, US 129 loses SR 51 as a hidden route after the concurrency ends and runs northwest along SR 100 into Georgia. =Georgia= US 129 provides the primary route between central Georgia and Athens. It approaches Athens from the south where it joins SR 10 Loop, a mostly interstate-grade bypass that rings Athens-Clarke County. Here US 129 turns right, toward the northeast, where it runs concurrently with US 78/US 29/US 441/SR 15 (and unsigned SR 422) along the bypass.

In this stretch after the Tennessee‚ÄìNorth Carolina state line, drivers will encounter 318 curves in a distance of around 11 miles. These curves make this stretch of highway a well-known motorcycle/sports car destination named Tail Of The Dragon. On weekends, through spring to the fall months, visitors are likely to see numerous riders and drivers on this stretch of the highway to experience the thrill and scenery. US 129 then travels due north, becoming known as Alcoa Highway and passing through the city of Maryville. It travels through Alcoa, passing by McGhee Tyson Airport, and then intersecting I-140. US 129 then crosses the Tennessee River on the James E. \\"Buck\\" Karnes Bridge into Knoxville. Shortly thereafter, US 129 becomes a limited-access highway for a short distance. It has an interchange with US 11/US 70 immediately after entering Knoxville. Shortly thereafter, US 129 meets its northern terminus, an interchange with I-40.

Walter Clement Alvarez (July 22, 1884June 18, 1978) was an American medical doctor of Spanish descent. He authored several dozen books on medicine, and wrote introductions and forewords for many others. Biography He was born in San Francisco and spent his childhood in Hawaii, where his father was a government physician. In 1910, having received his medical education in Stanford University, he began his practice. From 1913 to the end of 1925, Alvarez practiced internal medicine in San Francisco and conducted research at the University of California, Berkeley. He lived at 3837 Clay Street raising his family. In 1934 he became Professor of Medicine at the University of Minnesota (Mayo Foundation) and later served as Consultant in Medicine Emeritus. His father was Luis F. Alvarez, who worked as a physician in California and Hawaii and developed a method for the better diagnosis of macular leprosy. His sister was California artist and oil painter Mabel Alvarez. Alvarez was married to the former Harriet Skidmore Smythe and the couple had four children: Gladys, Luis, Robert and Bernice. Luis later became a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. His grandson is Walter Alvarez, a Professor of Geology at the University of California, Berkeley. Beginning after his retirement in 1951, Alvarez began writing a medical column which soon became syndicated throughout North America in hundreds of daily and weekly newspapers. The Walter C. Alvarez Memorial Award is named in his honor and is presented to a member or nonmember of the American Medical Writers Association to honor excellence in communicating health care developments and concepts to the public. He is most notable for his enlightened approach to homosexuality and his efforts to educate the medical profession and the broader public about the topic. He is regarded as an ally of the homophile movement in the 1950s-1970s. Alvarez' syndrome, a syndrome of hysterical or neurotic abdominal bloating without any excess of gas in the digestive tract, and Alvarez-waves, painless uterine contractions occurring during the length of pregnancy, are named after him. Alvarez was the first to investigate electric activity of a stomach and, thereby, became the founder of a new diagnostic gastroenterology branch ‚Äî electrogastrography. He died in California in 1978. His personal papers are held by Lane's Archives and Special Collections.  Publications   References   External links  * Early Photograph of Walter C.

God made these choices according to his own purposes apart from any conditions or qualities related to those persons. The counter-view to unconditional election is conditional election, the belief that God chooses for eternal salvation those who he foreknows will exercise their free will to respond to God's prevenient grace with faith in Christ. Summary In Calvinist (Reformed) theology, unconditional election is considered to be one aspect of predestination in which God chooses certain individuals to be saved. Those elected receive mercy, while those not elected, the reprobates, receive justice without condition. This unconditional election is essentially related to the rest of the TULIP doctrinal outline and hinges upon the supreme belief in the absolute sovereignty of God over the affairs of man. God unconditionally elects certain people even though they are sinful as an act of his saving grace apart from the shortcomings or will of man. Those chosen have done nothing to deserve this grace. In Calvinist and some other churches (Waldensians, Katharoi, Anabaptists, Particular Baptists, etc.) this election has been called \\"unconditional\\" because his choice to save the elect does not depend on anything inherent in any person chosen, on any act that a person performs or on any belief that a person exercises. Indeed, according to the doctrine of total depravity (the first of the five points of Calvinism), the influence of sin has so inhibited the individual's volition that no one is willing or able to come to or follow God apart from God first regenerating the person's soul to give them the ability to love him and take part in the salvation process. Hence, God‚Äôs choice in election is and can only be based solely on God's own independent and sovereign will and [not] upon the foreseen actions of man. Scholastic Calvinists have sometimes debated precisely when, relative to the decree for the Fall of man, God did his electing - see supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism - though such distinctions are not often emphasized in modern Calvinism. The Reformed position is frequently contrasted with the Arminian doctrine of conditional election in which God's eternal choice to save a person is conditioned on God‚Äôs certain foreknowledge of future events, namely, that certain individuals would freely exercise faith and trust in response to God's offer of salvation. The Arminian doctrine agrees that the influence of sin has so inhibited the individual's volition that no one is willing or able to come to or follow God, but the Arminian doctrine of prevenient (or \\"enabling\\") grace is considered sufficient to enable a person to believe and repent before regeneration. Based upon God's certain foreknowledge of individual human response to the gospel of Jesus Christ, God justly and sovereignly elected individuals to salvation. History The doctrine was first articulated and popularized by 4th century Church Father Augustine of Hippo during his debates with Pelagius, and he taught that saving grace is bestowed by God on the elect according to his sovereign decrees. Few later theologians prior to the Reformation would take up this idea. However, prominent exceptions include Thomas Aquinas. Unconditional election was first codified in the Belgic Confession (1561),Belgic Confession, article 16 (\\"The Doctrine of Election\\") re-affirmed in the Canons of Dort (1619),Canons of Dort, first head, chapter 1, article 7 (\\"Election Defined\\") which arose from the Quinquarticular Controversy, and is represented in the various Reformed confessions such as the Westminster Standards (1646).Westminster Confession of Faith It is one of the five points of Calvinism and is often linked with predestination. Today it is most commonly associated with the Reformation teachings of John Calvin known as Calvinism. Biblical passages A number of passages are put forth to support the doctrine, including (quotations are from the KJV): * Isaiah 42:1: \\"Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect Chosen One, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.\\" * John 15:16: \\"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\\" * John 1:12,13: \\"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\\" * Acts 13:48: \\"And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.\\" * Romans 9:15‚Äì16: \\"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

It runs for from St. John, Indiana, at US 41 to south of US 98 in downtown Panama City, Florida. One of its most notable landmarks is the William H. Natcher Bridge, a nearly mile-long cable-stayed bridge that connects Rockport, Indiana, to Owensboro, Kentucky, spanning the Ohio River. Route description =Florida= In Florida, US 231 is paired with unsigned State Road 75. The southern terminus is at Business US 98 (unsigned State Road 30) in downtown Panama City. The highway is carried by Harrison Avenue until its intersection with US 98. Continuing north, US 231 passes through Youngstown, Fountain, Alford, Cottondale, and Campbellton before entering Alabama. Major intersections include Business US 98, US 98, SR 77, SR 20, Interstate 10, US 90, SR 73, SR 273, and SR 2. =Alabama= In Alabama, US 231 is an alternate north-to-south fare to Interstate 65, the main north-to- south thoroughfare in the state. U.S. Route 231 serves the east-central part of the state, with I-65 further west and US 431 further east. While both US 231 and US 431 connect the major cities of Dothan and Huntsville, US 231 has a shorter route through fewer cities and terrain changes, avoiding the mountainous cities of Albertville, Gadsden, Oxford, and Heflin. However, there are some mountainous cities along the route, such as Arab, Oneonta, and Rainsville. U.S. Route 231 is divided along two-lane roads, three-laned roads, and four-laned undivided and divided highways. The entire stretch south of Montgomery is four-laned, mostly divided with some undivided stretches; as it is a critical connector in the National Highway System, which is a very important web of highways critical to U.S. infrastructure. The stretch between Arab and the state line is an almost entirely four-lane divided highway (with a stub descending/ascending Brindlee Mountain). Through Huntsville, Alabama, the route functions as Memorial Parkway - the main north-to-south freeway through downtown. The road is a freeway with frontage roads and Texas U-Turns, with some stretches with six lanes plus a frontage road exit lane in each direction. In the medical district of Huntsville, the freeway gains US 431 and loses the SR 53 designation. The road widens to ten lanes on the south side of Interstate 565, with the gained lanes used as access lanes for US 72 or I-565. On the north side of I-565, the road once again goes to six lanes and an exit lane, which is carried along its concurrency with US 72. About a mile north of the second junction with US 72, the route loses its frontage roads and reverts to a four-lane divided highway. In late February 2020, erosion caused both directions of the road along Brindlee Mountain to shut down indefinitely. The renovation of the road is stated to be completed possibly in early 2021 at the earliest. https://www.al.com/news/2020/03/us-231-near-huntsville-to-be-closed- for-a-year-for-repairs-aldot-says.html As such, US 231's traffic has been routed on several detours, some of which are listed below: * Trucks - Alabama State Route 67, Interstate 65, and Interstate 565 * Cars - Morgan County Road 32 to Alabama State Route 36 * Cars (Alternate Route) - Alabama State Route 67 to Alabama State Route 36 Trucks must follow a long bypass through Somerville and Priceville to avoid the steep downgrade on Morgan County Road 32, the main car thoroughfare across Brindlee Mountain alongside the closed section of US 231. SR 67 offers a much less steep three-laned alternative to the much steeper County Road 32. In general, the route is an important connector between Dothan, Montgomery, and Huntsville, three of the most populous cities in the state. =Tennessee= US 231 enters Tennessee from Alabama in a concurrency with US 431 until it reaches Fayetteville. North of there it runs through Shelbyville and later passes through the eastern part of the Nashville metro area, passing through the cities of Murfreesboro and Lebanon. By the time it reaches Bethpage, it joins U.S. Route 31E in another concurrency to the northeast before finally crossing the Kentucky State Line north of Westmoreland. The route is approximately from Tennessee's northern border to its southern border. =Kentucky= US 231 parallels Interstate 65 before reaching Bowling Green. From Bowling Green, US 231 closely parallels I-165 (formerly the William H. Natcher Parkway) until it reaches Owensboro. At Owensboro, US 231 joins US 60 (also known as the Wendell H. Ford Expressway) around the city's east side, which it then follows to just north of Maceo. US 60 then leaves toward the east while US 231 turns to the north, leaving the state via the William H. Natcher Bridge across the Ohio River. A portion of the Owensboro-area route is relatively new; in 2014, a new section from Kentucky 54 to Kentucky 2830 opened, bypassing the former bypass route. Part of that former route has been renumbered as Kentucky 603. The remainder, south of 603, is partly a dead-end city street and an abandoned lane that will eventually become part of the David Adkisson Greenbelt trail. =Indiana= In Indiana, US 231 has the distinction of being the state's longest continuous highway. It covers approximately in the Hoosier State. US 231 passes through the towns of Dale, Huntingburg, Jasper, and Loogootee before reaching Bloomfield. In Bloomfield, US 231 passes Shawnee Field, a local airport. US 231 slices through central Indiana before reaching Lafayette, where it runs just south of Purdue University. Next it winds northwest along Interstate 65 and then it splits off and terminates at US 41. Indiana's Major Moves program, which derives its funding from the lease of the Indiana Toll Road to private interests, has made it possible for the state to build many new miles of roadway throughout the state. As part of this program, US 231 is currently being updated to a new-terrain four-lane highway from the Indiana-Kentucky border through Spencer County to Interstate 64. This segment of US 231 has been named the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Parkway. As of April 2011, the Lincoln Parkway is complete from the Kentucky line to the interchange at I-64 and the bypass of Dale at the northernmost end of the project. It is a fully operational partial cloverleaf and the previous two-lane 231 overpass has been demolished. It has been replaced by a new four-lane overpass. The section from SR 162 to Indiana State Highway 70 near Chrisney was the last to be opened, after a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 15, 2011, much sooner than the original July 2011 projected date. In addition to the Spencer County project, a four-lane bypass of the Dubois County cities of Huntingburg and Jasper is also in the planning stages, but funding has not been secured. A firm timetable for construction has yet to materialize. History A US 231 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 U.S. Route 152 was commissioned in 1934, connecting Indianapolis with Hammond. It followed US 52 from Indianapolis to northwest of Lafayette, where it turned north to end at US 20 in Hammond. In 1938, the route was decommissioned, and became a southern extension of State Road 53 from northwest of Lafayette to Crown Point, a new State Road 152 from Highland to Hammond, and was simply dropped in favor of the overlapping US 52, State Road 8, and US 41 elsewhere. These parts of SR 53 and SR 8 became US 231 in 1952, when US 231 was extended north from Montgomery to US 41 south of St. John. =Kentucky Route 71= In Kentucky, US 231 was originally signed as Kentucky Route 71.Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (1939). Official Kentucky State Highway Map (PDF) (Map). Frankfort: Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Retrieved June 14, 2016. KY 71 originally ran from Scottsville to Owensboro. Portions of the original KY 71 in Butler County was rerouted to a bridge over the Green River in the early 1950s, replacing the Morgantown Ferry. In 1952, US 231 replaced the entire alignment of KY 71 in its entirety.Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (1957). Official Kentucky State Highway Map (PDF) (Map).

Simak. The original version consists of eight linked short stories, all originally published in Astounding Science Fiction under the editorship of John W. Campbell between 1944 and 1951, along with brief \\"notes\\" on each of the stories. These notes were specially written for the book, and serve as a bridging story of their own. The book was reprinted as ACE #D-283 in 1958, cover illustration by Ed Valigursky. Simak published a ninth City tale in 1973 called \\"Epilog\\". A 1980 edition of City includes this ninth tale; some (but not all) subsequent editions of the book also include \\"Epilog\\". Plot introduction The fixup novel describes a legend consisting of eight tales that the pastoral, pacifist Dogs recite as they pass down an oral legend of a creature known as Man. Each tale is preceded by doggish notes and learned discussion. An editor's preface notes that after each telling of the legend the pups ask many questions: :\\"What is Man?\\" they'll ask. :Or perhaps: \\"What is a city?\\" :Or: \\"What is a war?\\" :There is no positive answer to any of these questions.  Plot summary  =The Tales= As the tales unfold, they recount a world where humans, having developed superior transportation, have abandoned the cities and moved into the countryside. Hydroponic farming and decentralized power allow small communities to become self-sufficient. In the beginning, the driving force for dispersion is the fear of nuclear holocaust, but eventually humans discover they simply prefer the pastoral lifestyle. The tales primarily focus around the Webster family and their robot servant, Jenkins. The name Webster gradually becomes \\"webster\\", a noun meaning a human. Themes familiar to Simak readers recur in these stories, notably the pastoral settings and the faithful dogs. Each successive tale tells of further breakdown of urban society. As mankind abandons the cities, each family becomes increasingly isolated. Bruce Webster surgically provides dogs with a means of speech and he gives them contact lenses for better vision. The breakdown of civilization allows wandering mutant geniuses to grow up unrestrained by conventional mores. A mutant called Joe invents a way for ants to stay active year-round in Wisconsin, so that they need not start over every spring. Eventually, the ants form an industrial society in their hill. The amoral Joe, tiring of the game, kicks over the anthill. The ants ignore this setback and build bigger and more industrialized colonies. A later tale tells of a research station on the surface of Jupiter. (This story, first published as Desertion in 1944, was one of the first stories about pantropy.) Simak's version of Jupiter is a cold, windswept, and corrosive hell where only advanced technology allows the station to exist at all. A scientist is accompanied by Towser, his tired and flea-bitten old dog. But there is a problem: Men permanently transformed to survive unaided on Jupiter's surface leave the station to gather data and inexplicably fail to return. Finally, the scientist transforms himself and his canine companion into the seal-like beings that can survive the surface. They leave the station in their new form and experience Jupiter as a paradise. Towser's fleas and irritations are gone and he is able to talk telepathically to his former master. Like the previously transformed station personnel, the scientist decides never to return. He eventually does return, to share with all humankind what he has discovered. It seems impossible ‚Äì how can he show them the wondrous Jupiter that he and Towser perceive? Joe steps in again, once more out of sheer mischief. He knows a mind trick to allow people to broadcast meaning to others' minds as they speak. By means of a kaleidoscope-like instrument, he can twist the minds of other people so they can perform the mind trick. Thus all humanity learns the truth about Jupiter, and most elect to leave Earth, give up their physical humanity and live transformed on Jupiter's surface. Simak's vision of human apocalypse is unusual, not one of destruction, but simply of isolation. Much of humankind becomes so lonely that it eventually dies off. Some favor starting over as a completely different species capable of experiencing on Jupiter the simple bliss that humans have otherwise lost. Ten thousand years in the future, Jenkins is provided with a new body so he can better serve the few remaining \\"websters\\". By then, the dog civilization has spread all around the Earth, including the rest of the animals whom, little by little, the dogs introduce to their civilization. All of them are significantly intelligent, and Simak appears to mean that they were so all the while even though humans were not able to notice it. This civilization is a pacifist and vegetarian one. The dogs intervene in nature and distribute food to wild animals, managing to end virtually all predation. Besides, they also look for doors between dimensions through which some beings from different worlds are able to pass. At this point, a wraithlike creature called a \\"cobbly\\" appears, having traveled from another world on the time thread. Before it is driven away, Jenkins's new telepathic sense enables him to read the creature's mind to discover how it moves from world to world. Realizing that humanity cannot peacefully coexist with the Dogs and the other animals, Jenkins uses the knowledge to take his human charges to one of the other worlds. Eventually, the human race dies out on the new world. However, returning to the initial Earth in the final tale of the book, Jenkins finds the dogs dealing with the ever-growing Ant City, which is taking over the Earth. Jenkins travels to Geneva, where a last small group of humans sleep in suspended animation. He asks his former master, a Webster, how to deal with the ants. The answer is typically human ‚Äì poisoned bait, enough to kill but not before the bait is taken back to the ant colony to kill widely there. Jenkins is saddened because he realizes the Dogs will never accept this solution. He tells the dogs that the \\"websters\\" had no answer. The Dogs leave Earth for one of the other worlds. The original eight stories were written and published during World War II and reflect the attitude that humans are unable to live at peace with their fellow beings. There is an underlying theme throughout the book that humans possess a fundamental aggressive flaw they will never be able to overcome. =The Coda= Simak wrote the ninth and last tale in the City saga in 1973, twenty-two years after he wrote the previous episode. Jenkins is on the original Earth, living at the old Webster home, surrounded on all sides by the Ant City. He comes to realize that the Ant City is dead, just as a spaceship returns to take him to the robot worlds. Breaking through the wall of the city, he sees nothing but infinitely repeated versions of a single sculpture; a human boot kicking over an anthill. Reception Groff Conklin described City as a \\"strange and fascinating program . . . completely enthralling\\".\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1952, p.123 Boucher and McComas praised the volume as \\"a high-water mark in science fiction writing\\" adding, \\"Here is a book that caused these reviewers to chuck objective detachment out the window and emit a loud, partisan 'Whee!\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, October 1952, p. 99 P.

Because the fortress commands a pass through the Satpuras connecting the valleys of the Narmada and Tapti rivers, one of the most important routes from northern India to the Deccan, it was known as the \\"key to the Deccan\\". During the Mughal Era, it was considered that the Deccan started here while the empire from Asirgarh to Delhi was considered Hindustan.  History  The earliest mention of Asirgad is in the Mahabharat as a place of worship of Ashvatthama, who is still revered by Hindus as the guardian deity of the hill. According to local tradition, Asirgad was, from about 1600 B.C., the head-quarters of a Rajput chief. Later in Rajput poetry, Tunturpal, a Chohan, is mentioned as conquering Asir and Golkonda, and planting his garrisons in every country. [Tod's Rajputana, II. 408.] From him the fort seems to have been taken by the Taks, a branch of the Parmar Rajputs, and held by them from the beginning of the ninth to the close of the tenth century. Several times, during these two hundred years, the ' Tak from Asirgad' is mentioned by the Rajput poet Chand, as fighting for the defence of Chitod against the Musalmans. In 1025 the fort was taken by Ishtpal the founder of the Haras. [Tod's Rajputana, II. 420.] Ishtpal's great grandsons, Hamir and Gambhir, are enrolled among the one hundred and eight great vassals of Prithuraj the Chohan ruler of Ajmir. At the close of the thirteenth century (1295), Ala-ud-din Khilji, returning from his raid into the Deccan, took Asirgad, and except prince Rainsi, whose descendants were afterwards the Rajas of Harauti, put all the Haras to the sword. Later on the fort again passed out of Muhammadan hands and remained under a Hindu chief, till, at the close of the fourteenth century (1399), it was treacherously taken by Nasir Khan Faruki the second of the Musalman rulers of Khandesh. [Ferishta's (IV. 286-7) account of the capture is given above in the history chapter (244). The story has been (Cent. Prov. Gaz. 9) supposed to be purely legendary. But though the name of the chief, Asa the Ahir, may be taken from legends, there seems no sufficient reason to doubt the main facts of the story that the Farukis found Asirgad in the hands of a Yadav or Ahir chief and took it from him by treachery.] The Farukis greatly strengthened Asirgad, the lower fort, called Malaigad, [Of this lower fort the Akbar Nama (1602) says: \\"Below the main fort, but still on an elevated spot, is another fort called Malgad, which also is very strong. In comparison with the fortress, it seems at the bottom of the earth; compared with the surface of the ground, it looks half-way to the sky. This being the most advanced of the works, great care had been taken to strengthen it with guns and other implements. Below this was an inhabited place called takhati as large as a city. Elliot's History,\\" VI. 140.] being entirely the work of Adil Khan I. (1457-1503) the fifth of the dynasty. During the whole of the Faruki rule Asirgad remained their chief stronghold. [Central Province Gazetteer, 9.] In 1562 Pir Muhammad Khan, the governor of Malwa, made an unsuccessful attempt to capture it; [Elliot's History, V, 275.] nor did the emperor Akbar succeed in taking it (1600) until after a protracted siege of eleven months. [At the time of its capture by Akbar the fort was considered one of the wonders of the world. Baz Bahadur Uzbek and Karabeg, sent by Akbar to choose positions for the trenches and encampment, reported that they had never seen such a fortress in any country. However long an army might press the siege, nothing but the extraordinary good fortune of the emperor could effect its capture. Old soldiers and men who had travelled into distant lands; men who had seen the fortresses of Iran and Turan, of Ram, of Europe, and of the whole habitable world, had never beheld the equal of this. It stood on a high strong hill with three smaller fortified hills round it, like a halo round the moon. The entrance and outlets were difficult to discover. No other hill commanded it, and the approach was covered by brushwood and no high trees. An the walls, which were of great thickness, chambers and rooms were built for the officers of the artillery, where, during all seasons, they could live in comfort, and keep up a fire of cannon and musketry. All the time the country had been held by the dynasty, each prince, as he succeeded, did his best to keep the place in repair, to add to its strength, or to increase its stores, more especially its stores of artillery. The revenue,; of several districts were specially assigned to keep up the supply of artillery, so that the officers had independent sources for maintaining its efficiency. It was impossible to conceive a stronger fortress, or one more amply supplied with artiliery, warlike stores, and provisions. Were the fortress placed upon level ground, its reduction would be difficult; but such a hill, such a well secured fortress, and such artillery, were not to be found in any one place on the face of the earth. Akbar Nama (1602) in Elliot, VI. 138, 139. Bahadur had collected a very large number of men to garrison the fort. According to the Akbar Nama the copulation, in the fortress was like that of a city for it was full of men of every king. After the surrender the inhabitants came out and there was a continuous throng night and day for a week. Elliot; VI. 140.] When Akbar arrived at Ujain, with the intention of conquering the Deccan, he expected that, like his father Raja Ali, Bahadur would give his services to the imperial army. But as Bahadur showed himself unwilling to help, Akbar sent Miran Sadr-i-Jahan to find out the exact state of affairs in Khandesh. On learning that Bahadur was keenly hostile to the Moghals, Akbar sent orders to Shaikh Farid Bokhari to advance against Asirgad with a considerable force, and either to bring Bahadur, if he proved tractable, or to invest the fort and reduce it with all possible speed. The Moghal army, which had meanwhile been joined by Shaikh Abu-l-Fazl, encamped four miles from Asirgad, and Bahadur came down from the fort to meet the commanders. Every argument was used to bring him to submit to the emperor, but in vain. When all hope of Bahadur's submission was given up, Farid closed the roads to the fortress, dug trenches, and stationed 1000 horse on the Burhanpur road to cut off communication. The preparations were completed, but the Moghals failed to make any impression on the fortress. One day as Abu-l-Fazl was inspecting some of his trenches, one of the besieged, who had deserted to Akbar's camp,, offered to show him a path up to the wall of the Malai fort. Half, way up the mountain, to the west and slightly to the north, were two renowned outworks, called the Malai and Antarmalai, which had to be taken before Asir itself, could be reached, and between the north-west and north there was another unfinished bastion called Chunah Malai, a portion of its wall not finished. From east to south-west were hills, and in the south was a high mountain called Korhiah. A hill in the south-west, called Sapan, was occupied by the imperial forces. Abu-l-Fazl chose a detachment to follow him. Giving orders to the officer commanding the trench to watch for the sound of the trumpets and bugles, when be was to hasten to his assistance with ladders, he went with his chosen body of men to mount Sapan, and sent another detachment under Qara along the path that had been pointed out to him. They advanced, broke open one of the gates of the Malai fort, and sounded the bugle. The besieged rose to oppose them, but Abu- l-Fazl hastened to his men, and joined them at break of day when the besieged withdrew in confusion to Asir. On the same day other detachments of the army occupied Chunah Malai and mount Korhiah. [The Akbar Nama mentions a sortie made by the garrison which cost many of them their lives and the hill of Korhiah. Elliot, VI. 144.] Disheartened by these losses, and crippled by an epidemic among his troops, Bahadur Khan surrendered. [Blochmann's Ain-i- Akbari, I, xxiii.] Akbar held a grand Darbar, when the keys of the fortress were given up. Bahadur Khan was sent as a prisoner to Gwalior, [Akbar Nama in Elliot, VI. 135-146. Ferishta's account differs little from the above. He says, \\" When prince Murad Mirza died in the town of Shahpur, Danial Mirza succeeded him. Bahadur Khan neither sent condolence on his brother's death nor congratulations on his accesion to the command of the forces in the Deccan, as is customary; and when Akbar Padshah, a few years afterwards arrived at Mandu, with the avowed intention of invading the Deccan, Bahadur Khan, instead of adopting the policy of his father in relying on the honour of Akbar and going with an army to co-operate with him, shut himself in the fort of Asir, and began preparations to withstand a siege. To this end he invited into the place fifteen thousand persons including labourers, artisans, and shopkeepers, and filled it with horses and cattle, in order that they might serve for work, and eventually for food and other purposes, When Akbar heard of these proceedings, he sent orders to Khan Khanan, and to prince Danial Mirza, to continue the siege of Ahmednagar, while he himself marched to the south and occupied Burhanpur, leaving one of his generals to besiege Asirgad, The blockade of this fort continued for a length of time till the air from filth became fetid, and an epidemic disease raged, caused by the number of cattle which daily died. At this time a report was spread, and generally believed in the garrison that Akbar had the power of reducing forts by the art of necromancy, and that magicians accompanied him for that purpose. Bahadur Khan, believing that his misfortunes arose from this power, took no steps to counteract the evils by which he was surrounded. He neither gave orders for the removal of the dead cattle, for the establishment of hospitals, nor for sending out useless persons, till at length the soldiers, worn out, became careless on duty, and the Moghals stormed and carried the lower fort called Malaigad. Nothing could exceed the infatuation of Bahadur Khan, who, though he had a ten years store of grain and an enormous amount of money, kept the troops in arrears; and they, seeing no prospect of redress, resolved to seize him and deliver him to Akbar. Before this project was carried into effect, Bahadur Khan discovered the plot, and consulted his officers, who all agreed it was too late to think of a remedy. The pestilence raged with great fury the troops were completely exhausted, and nothing remained but to open negociations for the surrender of the fort, on condition that the lives of the garrison should be spared and that they should march out with their property. The terms were acceded to, with the exception of the last proposition regarding the Khan's private property which all fell into the king's hands;, and Bahadur Khan, the last of the Faruki kings, humbled himself before the throne of Akbar Padshah in the year 1008 H. (1599 A.D.); while the impregnable fortress of Asir, with ten years' provisions and countless treasures, fell into the hands of the conqueror. Briggs' Ferishta, IV 335,327.] This is the Musalman version of the siege. Ogilby's account, probably compiled (1670) from Portuguese sources, differs from it in several important particulars. At the coming of Akbar, after having conquered the kingdom of Deccan, king Miran (Bahadur) deserted the city of Brampour, and fled with all the inhabitants and their goods to the fort Syr, so that Akbar got nothing but the empty city and therefore went from thence to Syr with an army of 200,000 men. The fortress was plentifully stored for many years with wood, corn, and other provisions for sixty thousand men, and was fortified with three thousand pieces of ordnance. In the fort were, besides king Miran, seven other heroic princes, which though of the Muhammadan religion, yet employed Portuguese; who having the sole conduct of this war, fortified the fort with no less care than art; so that the Moghal's labour, though he had besieged the fort with two hundred thousand men, was all in vain; for the besieged, by the convenient situation of the fort, their continual discharging of great guns, and prudent management of affairs, prevented him taking the same by storm. When Akbar saw that it was impossible to conquer the fort by force, he resolved to try what he could do by policy; wherefore he endeavoured to attain his ends by money and presents, and desired to enter into conference with king Miran, swearing by his head, the greatest oath imaginable, that immediately after he had spoken with him he should return in safety to the fort again. Miran being doubtful what might be the event of this business, entered into counsel with his officers about it; where the Abyssinian commanders and the seven princes, judged it altogether inconvenient for him to go out of the castle; but of others, who were enticed thereto by bribery, seemed to be quite of another opinion; whose advice he following, went out of the fort, having upon him a garment in fashion of a cloak, which reached, down to his knees, as a testimony of his submission. Coming to the great Moghal, whom he found sitting like an image, yet with a smiling countenance, he bid him welcome three times; upon which Miran approaching nearer to him, bowed down his head, when one of the Moghal princes taking hold of him, threw him on the ground; to which rude affront it was judged Akbar consented, notwithstanding he seemingly reprehended him for his rashness, and mildly persuaded Miran to send letters to the watches which guarded the outward walls. After which Miran required liberty to return to the castle, but Akbar not regarding his oath, would not permit him to go back again. The Abyssinian governor was no sooner informed of what had passed, but he sent his son with a letter to the Moghal; in which he taxed him with injustice, for detaining Miran contrary to his oath, advising him to let him return peaceably. according to his promise. The Moghal hereby understanding that the whole management of affairs was left to the direction of this Abyssinian, thought if he could but corrupt him, the place might be easily subdued; wherefore he asked the son if his father would not come thither in case should king Miran command him, To which the youth boldly replied that his father was no such person as he took him for; neither would he leave the castle to come and consult with him, that he must in vain expect to obtain the fort with his father's consent; and if he would not release Miran, yet there should not long want a successor Which confident answer so incensed Akbar, that he caused the young man immediately to be stabbed, which when his father had notice of, he presently sent the Moghal word that he would beg of the gods never to behold the face of such a perfidious prince; and afterwards taking his sash in his hand, he went amongst the soldiers, and thus bespake them; ' Oh brothers ! the winter approaches which will drive the Moghal from the siege, and to avoid their utter ruin, force them all to retire home. None but God shall ever be able to conquer this place, unless the inhabitants thereof will surrender the same; therefore resolve valiantly to defend the same' Having ended this speech, he went and strangled himself immediately. After his decease, the inhabitants, defending the place for some time, kept the Moghal continually employed; who, after he had used all possible means in vain, having, no great guns at hand wherewith to batter down the walls, at last resolved to try if he could purchase the inhabitants to a surrender by great sums of money; which to accomplish, he sent to the governors very considerable presents of gold and silver; whereby he did so cool and abate their courage, that none of the seven successors of the realm durst assume the government; for they perceiving the generals to be fearful, and their courage no longer to exert itself, could foresee and expect nothing but the sudden loss of the place; and accordingly it so fell out; for after a few days the fort was surrendered and with it the whole kingdom was subjected to the Moghal, who got peaceable possession thereof with an invaluable treasure. He received all the inhabitants favourably, except the imprisoned king and the seven successive princes, whom he dispersed into several provinces, allowing king Miran three thousand and each of the other two thousand ducats per annum for their maintenance. [Atlas, V. 237. In another passage Ogilby (1670) calls it Hoseer, the most eminent and the strongest fort of all the province of Khandesh. It is built, he says, on the top of a high and steep mountain, incredibly fortified by nature and able to contain 40,000 horse. In the middle of it are springs which water the mountain and make. the earth so fruitful in the production of grass, herbs, and corn, that there is no want either of provisions or other necessaries; it is also planted round about with very fine brass guns brought by the last king of Surat. But the water which springs out of this mountain is very unwholesome to drink, and causes worms to grow in the legs; which was the only instrument whereby Akbar conquered this place. In another place, on the same page, Ogilby refers to the fortress of Syr, which, for its situation and strength, is the most considerable of all the country and impregnable, for it lies on the top of a high mountain and is three leagues in circumference, surrounded with three walls, which are so made that the one may conveniently defend the other; for though Akbar besieged king Miran (Bahadur) with a hundred thousand men, yet he could not conquer the same by force, but only by policy and treachery. In this castle, he adds, were anciently kept, according to the custom of the country, seven kings with their families and retinues, which never came from thence, except that the king of the country which was nearest related to him, died without male issue. Both the names, Hoseer and Syr, and the descriptions, though Ogilby seems not to have known it, apply to Asirgad.] The details of the ammunition found in the fortress were more than 1300 pieces of artillery with balls varying in weight from about 80 pounds to half a pound (two mans to half a sher). There were many mortars, hukhadan, and also many battering rams, manjaniks, each of which threw stones of forty or eighty thousand pounds (1000 or 2000 mans). On every bastion were large iron caldrons, in each of which twenty or thirty mans of oil could be boiled and poured on the assailants in case of assault. Of provisions of all sorts, wines, medicines, and aromatic roots, there was vast abundance. Though some thousands of men had been fed from them for more than eleven months the stores of grain and oil were not appreciably lessened, and in spite of all that had been expended there were endless supplies of shot and shell. [Akbar Nama in Elliot, VI. 139,140.] An inscription, cut in the rock near the main gateway, records Akbar's capture of Asirgad with the date 1009 A.H. (1600 A.D.) On the fall of Asirgad, Akbar made Khandesh a province, suba, and fixed the governor's residence at Asirgad. [Gladwin's Ain-i-Akbari, II. 52.] The fort remained in the possession of the Delhi emperors for about 150 years. In 1623, when in rebellion against his father, prince Shah Jahan took refuge in it, and afterwards, when he became emperor, he built a great mosque. Of Aurangzeb's reign, the only records are an inscription and a gun. [For details see below, p. 585,] In 1720, Nizam-ul-Mulk governor of Malwa invaded the Deccan, crossed the Narbada with 12,000 men, and obtained Asirgad by a bribe. [Elliot, VII. 490.] In 1760 Asirgad passed into the hands of Bajirao Peshwa, and eighteen years later it was handed over to Mahadaji Sindia. [Grant Duff, 306.] About this time one of the officers with General Goddard's force describes it as having a garrison of 1500 men, and being so strong that the commandant was independent and bid defiance to all his neighbours. [Account of Bombay (1781), 288.] In 1803, shortly after the battle of Assaye, it was taken, with little resistance, from Daulatrao Sindia by a detachment of General Wellesley's army under Colonel Stevenson. On the conclusion of peace, in the same year, it was again made over to Sindia. On the 12th February 1819, as its commandant Jasvantrao Lar was believed to have given shelter to Appa Sahib, the ex-ruler of Nagpur, and to the famous Pendhari chief Chitu, Sir John Malcolm's force, consisting of Horse Artillery, the Third Cavalry. and the first battalion of Bombay Native Infantry marched against Asirgad. He encamped within five thousand yards of the fort and remained there, till, on being joined by the Bombay Brigade and the battering guns which had been left in the rear, he moved to a position north-west of the fort. About this time, Lieut.-General Smith was engaged in closing the passes north of Asirgad, with a view to intercept the escape of fugitive Pendharis supposed to be concealed in the forests near the fort, if not within its walls. In the course of these operations he made a march of thirty-five miles and was on the point of taking Chitu prisoner, when his party dispersed; Appa Sahib likewise narrowly escaped. [This seems doubtful. Captain Blacker (Memoir of the Maratha Wars, 1817-1819, 424) says: \\" Appa Sahib was certainly not in the fort when it surrendered; and it is doubtful whether he was ever admitted \\" On the other hand, the writer of the Maratha and Pendhari Campaign (1819) says 'Jasvantrao Lar, even on the surrender, denied that Appa Sahib had been in the fort at all; but we had much better authority from the evidence of some of the prisoners, and it appeared that Appa Sahib had escaped from the fort about ten days before we got possession of it.' 271.] While trying to persuade Sir John Malcolm that he meant to surrender, it was known that Jasvantrao Lar, the commandant of the fort, was making active preparations for defence. Accordingly, as soon as reinforcements arrived from Jalna, Malegaon, and Nagpur, an attack was planned. The forces set apart for the attack on the town were ordered to meet at midnight on the 17th of March, and to move a short time afterwards. The column of attack, commanded by Colonel Fraser of the Royal Scots, consisted of five companies of that regiment, the flank companies of His Majesty's 30th and 67th Foot, and of the Madras European Regiment, five companies of the first battalion of the 12th Madras Native Infantry, and a detail of Sappers and Miners. The reserve, under Major Dalrymple of His Majesty's 30th, was composed of the companies of that regiment not employed in the column of attack, one company of the King's 67th, one of the Madras European Regiment, and nine companies of Native Infantry from the first battalion of the 7th Regiment, the first battalion of the 12th and the second battalion of the 17th, with detachments from the 2nd and 7th Madras Native Cavalry, and four Horse Artillery guns. The attacking column advanced along a stream bed running parallel to the works on the south side, till, arriving within a convenient distance of the town, they made a rush for the gate, and succeeded in gaining it. The reserve in the meantime, in two parties, occupied points in the stream by which the column of attack had advanced, and in another stream that ran parallel to it sufficiently near to allow of their rendering support. Sir John Malcolm had been directed to distract the enemy's attention by operations on the northern side, and the duty was performed by a force composed of the 3rd Cavalry, the second battalion of the 6th Regiment Madras Native Infantry, and the first battalion of the 14th, the first battalion of the 8th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, six howitzers, and two Horse Artillery guns. The town was carried very expeditiously and with small loss, the troops finding immediate cover in the streets. In the course of the day a battery for six light howitzers was completed in the town and directed against the lower fort. On the night of the 19th March the enemy made a sally upon one of the British posts which was considerably advanced, but were soon repulsed. In the course of the same night a battery of eight heavy guns was completed. On the 20th at daybreak its fire opened, and by the evening had effected a formidable breach in the lower fort, besides inflicting serious injury on some of the upper works. On that evening the enemy made another sally into the town, and gained the main street. They were repulsed, but success was accompanied by the loss of Colonel Fraser who fell in the act of rallying his men. On the morning of the 21st an accidental explosion in the rear of the breaching battery proved fatal to two native officers and about a hundred men. The disaster did not extend to the battery, which continued firing with good effect. In the afternoon a mortar battery was completed, and some shells were thrown from it. For several days little occurred except the erection, on the night of the 24th, of another battery three hundred and fifty yards to the left of the breaching battery. Two other batteries were subsequently erected, one on the south side to breach the lower fort in a second place, the other designed to silence a large gun on the north-east bastion of the upper-fort. [This gun is said to have been cast at Burhanpur, and to have been thrown over the battlements after the siege, and sold as metal. A stone-shot, said to have belonged to it, measures 21 inches in diameter, and weighs about 450 pounds. The gun would therefore be technically a 1300-pounder. This is only half the size of the great Bijapur gun cast at Ahmednagar in A.D. 1549. Central Province Gazetteer, 12.] On the 29th two batteries were constructed for an attack on the east side of the fort. On the following morning the enemy abandoned the lower fort, which was immediately occupied by the British troops. The batteries which had been solely directed against the lower fort were now disarmed, and the guns removed from the town into the place which their fire had reduced. In the situation which had been gained, the firing against the upper fort was speedily resumed from various batteries, aided by others below. This continued for several days, and so many shot had been fired that a deficiency began to be feared, and a reward was offered by the besiegers for bringing back to the camp the shot previously expended. This expedient stimulated the activity of the camp followers and succeeded in producing an abundant supply. The operations of the siege were vigorously pursued till the 5th of April, when Jasvantrao Lar expressed a wish to negotiate. Some intercourse took place, but the efforts of the besiegers so far from being slackened were increased. On the 8th Jasvantrao Lar repaired to General Doveton's head-quarters to endeavour to procure terms, but in vain, and on the morning of the 9th, a British party took possession of the upper fort, the garrison descending into the town and grounding their matchlocks in a square of British troops formed for their reception. The enemy lost forty- three killed and ninety-five wounded, and the British eleven European officers, four native officers, and ninety-five European and two hundred and thirteen native non-commissioned rank and file killed and wounded. The fall of Asirgad closed, the Maratha campaign of 1818-19. Since then the fort has remained undisturbed in British hands. During the 1857-58 mutinies, Captain Birch held it with a party of the Bhil Corps. It is generally garrisoned by a wing of native infantry and two companies of Europeans. Except the old guns there is no artillery. The only objects of interest are a mosque, a large gun, and several inscriptions. The mosque, with two elegant minarets but no cupolas, is now used as a European barrack. Its building is commemorated by an inscription near the large reservoir. Two inscriptions date during Aurangzeb's reign. One, on the south-west gate, records the transfer of the fort to Aurangzeb in 1660. The other inscription is on the large gun on the south-west bastion. This piece, a magnificent specimen of native gun-casting, was made at Burhanpur in 1663. The gun metal appears to contain a very large proportion of copper. The casting has been made on a hollow iron core welded in ribands, which now forms the bore of the piece. [The principal dimensions of the gun are, length from muzzle to breech, twelve feet nine inches; length from muzzle to trunnions, seven feet three inches; girth at breech, eight feet two and a half inches; girth in front of trunnion, six feet six inches; girth at muzzle, five feet seven inches; diameter of bore, eight and a half inches. The calibre is somewhat larger and the length considerably greater than those of the British sixty-eight pounders. In weight the gun cannot be less than seven tons.] It is elaborately ornamented in relief with Persian inscriptions and scroll work beginning from the muzzle. [The inscriptions run: (1) \\"When the sparks of sorrow fly from me, life leaves the body, as grief falls on the world when flames issue from the fiery zone;\\" (2) Aurangzeb's seal, with his full title, Abul Muzaffar Mohiyuddin Muhammad Aurangzeb, Shah Ghazi; \\" (3) made at Burhanpur in the year 1074 A.H. (1663 A.D.); (4) \\" the gun ' Mulk Haibats ' terror of the country; (5) \\" in the rule of Muhammad Husain Arab;\\" (6) \\"a ball of thirty-five shers and twelve shers of powder, Shah Jahani weight.\\"] A breech-loading wall piece, also found in the fort and of about one pound calibre, has been removed to the Khandwa public garden. The breech- loading apparatus appears to have been on the simple plan of a detachable chamber introduced into a slot in the side of the gun, and kept in position by a wedge or bolt. An inscription shows that it was placed in the fort by Ali Shah Faruki in 1589.Khandesh District Gazetteers https://gazetteers.maharashtra.gov.in/cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Khandesh%20District/appendix.html#39 The Asirgarh fort is said to have been built by a king named Asa Ahir in the early 15th century. He was murdered by Nasir Khan of Khandesh. Nasir Khan's descendant Miran Bahadur Khan (1596‚Äì1600) declared his independence and refused to pay homage to the Mughal emperor Akbar and his son Daniyal. Akbar marched towards Burhanpur in 1599 and occupied the city. Akbar then besieged Asirgarh fort and captured it on 17 January 1601. During the Second Anglo- Maratha War, on 18October 1803, British forces took the pettah of Asigarh with a loss of two killed and five wounded. The fort's garrison subsequently surrendered on the 21st after the attackers had erected a battery.  Architecture  The architecture of the fort was influenced by the Mughals, an amalgamation of Islamic, Persian, Turkish and Indian styles. There are three- man made ponds to provide a water supply. There is a temple known as Gupteshwar Mahadev Mandir, dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva. There is a local legend that Ashwatthama, from Mahabharat era , used to come to this temple to worship and offer flowers each morning to Lord Shiva. There is a ruined mosque with minarets known as Asir Masjid inside the Fort. Apart from the Hindu and Muslim architecture, some ruins are of British origin and there are also British graves. This fort has been deserted following the departure of the British.

It is located on a hill overlooking the port of Dartmouth, Devon, England. Royal Naval officer training has taken place in Dartmouth since 1863. The buildings of the current campus were completed in 1905. Earlier students lived in two wooden hulks moored in the River Dart. Since 1998, BRNC has been the sole centre for Royal Naval officer training. History The training of naval officers at Dartmouth dates from 1863, when the wooden hulk was moved from Portland and moored in the River Dart to serve as a base. In 1864, after an influx of new recruits, Britannia was supplemented by . Prior to this, a Royal Naval Academy (later Royal Naval College) had operated for more than a century from 1733 to 1837 at Portsmouth, a major naval installation. The original Britannia was replaced by the in 1869, which was renamed Britannia. The foundation stone for a new building at the college was laid by King Edward VII in March 1902. Sir Aston Webb designed the shore-based college at Dartmouth, which was built by Higgs and Hill and practically completed in 1905. The first term of cadets entered at the R.N. College Osborne were transferred to Dartmouth in September 1905. The college was originally known as the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth (BRNC). As a Royal Naval shore establishment, it was later known also by the ship name HMS Britannia (a battleship called operated from 1904 to 1918). The college was re-named HMS Dartmouth in 1953, when the name Britannia was given to the newly launched royal yacht . The training ship moored in the River Dart at Sandquay, a Sandown class minehunter formerly known as , continues to bear the name Hindostan. As cadets at the college will be aware, there are 187 steps down from the college to Hindostan's mooring at Sandquay. Cadets originally joined the Royal Naval College, Osborne, at the age of 13 for two years' study and work before joining Dartmouth. The Royal Naval College, Osborne closed in 1921. During the Second World War, after six Focke-Wulf aircraft bombed the College in September 1942, students and staff moved activities to Eaton Hall in Cheshire until the autumn of 1946. Two bombs had penetrated the College's main block, causing damage to the quarterdeck and surrounding rooms.Article by Jane Harrold and Richard Porter in The Britannia Magazine 2004, Crest Publications, pp. 6‚Äì7.

W. Beckett, Discovering British Regimental Traditions (Osprey Publishing, 2007), p. 58 In 2020, a group of Junior Rates were trained at BRNC to help alleviate added pressure on HMS Raleigh. On 13 August 2020, a troop of 34 Ratings and 130 officers passed out simultaneously for the first time in the history of the Royal Navy. Entry Prospective cadets entrants must have at least 72 UCAS points. They then proceed to the Admiralty Interview Board, where they are tested mentally and physically. Several mental aptitude tests are administered, along with a basic physical fitness test and a medical examination. Officer cadets, as they are known until passing out from the college, can join between the ages of 18 and 39. While most cadets join BRNC after finishing university, some join directly from secondary school. The commissioning course is 30 weeks, with Warfare Officers and Aircrew spending a further 19 weeks studying academics at the college. A large contingent of international and Commonwealth students are part of the student body. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary sends its officer cadets to BRNC for a 10-week initial officer training course, before they start at a maritime college. Royal cadets King George V and King George VI were naval cadets at Dartmouth. The first \\"significant encounter\\" between Prince Philip of Greece and the then Princess Elizabeth took place at Dartmouth in July 1939, where Philip was a naval cadet. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of York also attended Dartmouth. Prince William spent a brief period at the College after leaving Sandhurst as part of his training with all three of Britain's Armed Forces.

The road runs straight north from there and becomes a divided highway as it approaches the north end of CR 278 just south of Interstate 10 (I-10) at exit 85 in DeFuniak Springs. Within the city, US 331/SR 83 remains a divided highway running in the same trajectory, where the only intersection of any level of importance is CR 280(Bob Sikes Road). After the intersection with Myrtle Avenue, it takes another slight curve to the northeast. Two more local intersections will be encountered before the road runs beneath a bridge for the CSX P&A; Subdivision, and a parallel bridge with Baldwin Avenue just before the intersection with U.S. Route 90, where both U.S. Route 331 and SR 83 split into two separate concurrencies; US 331 turns left while SR 83 turns right. US 90/331 curves northwest where it encounters the western terminus of Baldwin Avenue, the very city street it crosses under on the north side of the P&A; Subdivision. After this it runs along the same railroad line where it encounters the DeFuniak Springs Country Club, but at the eastern edge of DeFuniak Springs Airport, the concurrency ends as US 90 heads west towards Pensacola, while US 331 turns north onto the two-lane hidden SR 187. The newly independent US 331 runs straight north for one mile. Shortly after the intersection of Walton Road, US 331 curves slightly to the northwest. This trajectory continues for 1.7 miles until it curves more to the northwest just before the intersection with the western terminus of Sunrise Road which leads to CR 1883. From that point it runs north of Holly Lake and then King Lake, and soon after this serves as the northern terminus of a local street named King Lane Road which leads to a local campground. Continuing in the same direction, the road passes more local dead end streets before crossing a bridge over Gum Creek. then climbs a small hill as it passes by an abandoned farm field and later a dirt road named Andrews Road before approaching the western terminus of CR 192, which also shares an intersection with Doctor Nelson Road. Entering Liberty the road descends slightly into a minimal valley and begins to curve more westerly after passing by the First Baptist Church, then crosses a bridge over Middle Creek. After the bridge it passes a local dirt road named Harrison Drive. Most of the road is surrounded by forestland, but the woods on the southwest side are thinner because the obstruct some local farmland, interrupted by the clearing for another church on the southwest side of the road. Next door is a local gas station and convenience store, which is across the street from one of three private houses on the northeast corner of the west end of County Road 1084. One more church can be found on the southwest side of the road before it crosses over another bridge over Big Swamp Creek, and another bridge over the Bee Branch between South Hall Road and Williams Road before it starts to curve back to the northwest. The road maintains the same relative trajectory as it passes some farmland and local dead end streets, After passing under a power line right-of-way, US 331 encounters the first intersection and south end of a concurrency with County Road 2, a former segment of State Road 2. Just north of that intersection on the opposite side is the eastern terminus of County Road 2A. Later the road curves around another pond into another angle further to the northwest. The telephone poles along the east side of the street veer off into the woods along a former segment of the road just south of the end of the concurrency with CR 2, after which the road turns straight north. However the straight trajectory doesn't last as long as one might expect as the road curves slightly to the right south of the shared intersection with South Suttles Road and the abandoned Pittman Road and then runs between two ponds before curving back to the left in order to cross a bridge over Long Creek. North of the bridge, it enters Gordon, where it encounters two county roads along the east side, specifically the western terminus of County Road 0605 (Jackson Still Cutoff) and then the southern terminus of County Road 285 which leads to Britton Hill, the highest natural point in the State of Florida. The road enters the Town of Paxton along some farm fields on both sides of the road, and the first intersection is a private driveway leading northeast to a house on the other side of Quiet Lake. The next intersection is a dirt road to the southwest named Wain Huckabee Road. Only when it approaches a water tower on the grounds of the Ellis Agricultural Field Airport does US 331 get close to a moderately important intersection, specifically the intersection of County Road 147 (Webster Lane), which despite being an odd-numbered route spans west to east from SR 85 west of Paxton to CR 285 north of Britton Hill. Despite being in an incorporated community, the surroundings of US 331 remain relatively agricultural with exceptions of farm-related businesses, and some random schools, churches, residences, local stores, and even the Town Hall, the vicinity of which actually contains a center left-turn lane. US 331 actually begins to curve straight north again between the intersections of South end of Vann Circle and Clear Springs Road and the north end of Vann Circle where it will remain throughout the rest of the state. The last two intersections in Florida are with another loop street, albeit a deformed one named Geohagan Circle. US 331 crosses the Florida-Alabama State line entering Florala, where SR 187 terminates, Alabama State Route 9 begins, and the road itself momentarily becomes a four-lane undivided highway. =Alabama= Once crossing the state line, US 331 immediately enters Florala, where it starts a concurrency with Alabama State Route 54 (SR 54) on the east side of town. The highway continues into downtown Florala, where SR 55 joins the concurrency (this intersection serves as a terminus for SR 54). US 331 continues northward to Opp, where it becomes concurrent with US 84 as a bypass around the eastern side of town. A business route of US 331 continues northward through town and rejoins US 331 north of Opp, just after US 84 leaves the concurrency with US 331. The highway then continues northward and enters Crenshaw County. It keeps north and into the town of Brantley, where US 29 forms a concurrency with US 331. The highways continue north into Luverne, where US 29 turns northeast and US 331 turns northwest as they leave town. US 331 soon turns back to the north and passes through several small communities before entering Montgomery County. It passes through several more small communities before entering the southern part of the city of Montgomery. It then intersects the southern bypass of the city (US 80 and US 82). This intersection serves as the northern terminus for US 331. History A US 331 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 The original version of US 331 traveled along what is now U.S. Route 29 south of Flomaton, Alabama between 1926 and 1936. The current version was revived in 1953. Beginning in 1956, signs for U.S. Highways in Florida had different colors for each highway. The shield for US 331 was green with white lettering and outline, until the state was forced by the federal government to conform to standards that required consistent black-and-white signs in 1993. Until 2007, US 331/SR 83 turned left at State Road 20 in Florida in a short concurrency until it reached Madison Street, then traveled north past Owl's Head Road just south of Eglin Air Force Base.

It is to be distinguished from prevenient grace, particularly associated with Arminianism, which teaches that the offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause-effect, deterministic method, but rather in an influence-and-response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied. The doctrine Fourth-century Church Father Augustine of Hippo taught that God grants those whom he chooses for salvation the gift of persevering grace, and that they could not conceivably fall away. This doctrine gave rise to the doctrine of irresistible grace (gratia irresistibilis), though the term was not used during Augustine's lifetime. According to Calvinism, those who obtain salvation do so, not by their own \\"free\\" will, but because of the sovereign grace of God. That is, men yield to grace, not finally because their consciences were more tender or their faith more tenacious than that of other men. Rather, the willingness and ability to do God's will are evidence of God's own faithfulness to save men from the power and the penalty of sin, and since man is dead in sin and a slave to it he can not decide or be wooed to follow after God, God must powerfully intervene by giving him life and drawing the sinner to himself. In short, Calvinism argues that regeneration must precede faith. In contrast, Arminianism argues that God‚Äôs grace through Jesus Christ stirs up a willingness to know God and respond to the gospel before regeneration; it is how God intervenes that separates Calvinism from Arminianism. Calvin says of this intervention that \\"it is not violent, so as to compel men by external force; but still it is a powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit, which makes men willing who formerly were unwilling and reluctant,\\". Despite the denial within Calvin and within the Calvinist confessionsWestminster Confession of Faith, X.1Canons of Dort, Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine, Article 16 John Gill says that \\"this act of drawing is an act of power, yet not of force; God in drawing of unwilling, makes willing in the day of His power: He enlightens the understanding, bends the will, gives an heart of flesh, sweetly allures by the power of His grace, and engages the soul to come to Christ, and give up itself to Him; he draws with the bands of love. Drawing, though it supposes power and influence, yet not always coaction and force: music draws the ear, love the heart, and pleasure the mind.\\" =Objections to the doctrine= Arminian Christians associated with Arminianism, such as John Wesley and part of the Methodist movement, reject this Calvinist doctrine. They believe that as Adam and Eve were free to choose between right and wrong, humanity is able, as a result of the prevenient or preceding grace of God through Jesus Christ, to choose to turn from sin to righteousness and believe on Jesus Christ who draws all of humanity to Himself. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. . In this view, (1) after God's universal dispensation of grace to mankind, the will of man, which was formerly adverse to God and unable to obey, can now choose to obey through the work of Christ; and (2) although God's grace is a strong initial catalyst to effect salvation, it is not irresistible but may be ultimately resisted and rejected by a human being. Both Calvinism and Arminianism agree that the question of the resistibility of grace is inexorably bound up with the theological system's view of the sovereignty of God. The fundamental question is whether God can allow individuals to accept or reject His grace and yet remain sovereign. If so, then grace can be resistible. If not, then grace must be irresistible. This different understanding of sovereignty is often attributed to an improper understanding of total depravity. However, both Calvin and Arminius taught total depravity. Total depravity is expressly affirmed in Article III of the Five articles of Remonstrance. Nevertheless, Calvinist Charles Hodge says, \\"The (Arminian) and (Roman Catholic) doctrine is true, if the other parts of their doctrinal system are true; and it is false if that system be erroneous. If the (Calvinistic) doctrine concerning the natural state of man since the fall, and the sovereignty of God in election, be Scriptural, then it is certain that sufficient grace does not become efficacious from the cooperation of the human will.\\" Hodge's argument follows Calvinist teaching which denies that the work of Jesus Christ empowers humanity to respond to the gospel before regeneration. Calvinism's rejection of prevenient grace leaves humanity in a state of Total Depravity which requires regeneration of an individual before that individual is capable to believe or repent. John the Baptist called all to his baptism for the remission of sins and multitudes responded without regeneration . The New Testament regularly calls individuals to repent and believe with no indication that they had been previously regenerated. The Apostle Peter called the Jews to repent and be converted . Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would convict the world of sin . Calvinism's response is found in Limited Atonement. So as a result of the Calvinist understanding of God's sovereignty, one must conclude that God's election does not depend upon any human response, necessitating a belief in (1) both Total Depravity and Unconditional Election, (2) Irresistible Grace rather than Prevenient Grace, and (3) Limited Atonement; if any of these beliefs are rejected, this logic fails. Lutheran LutherTappert, T.G., Selected Writings of Martin Luther, Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007, p.325 Like Calvinists, Lutherans view the work of salvation as monergistic in which an unconverted or unrepentant person always resists and rejects God and his ways.Formula of Concord: Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 71; par. 18 Even during conversion, the Formula of Concord says, humans resist \\"the Word and will of God, until God awakens him from the death of sin, enlightens and renews him.\\"Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 59 Furthermore, they both see the preaching of the gospel as a means of grace by which God offers salvation. Calvinists distinguish between a resistible, outward call to salvation given to all who hear the free offer of the gospel, and an efficacious, inward work by the Holy Spirit. Every person is unwilling to follow the outward call to salvation until, as the Westminster Confession puts it, \\"being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed by it.\\"Westminster Confession of Faith, X.1,2. Once inwardly renewed, every person freely follows God and his ways as \\"not only the obligatory but the preferable good,\\" and hence that special renewing grace is always effective. Contrary to the Calvinist position, Lutherans hold that whenever the Holy Spirit works outwardly through the Word and sacraments, he always acts inwardly through them as well. Unlike Calvinists, Lutherans believe the Holy Spirit always works efficaciously. The Word heard by those that resist it is just as efficacious as the Word preached to those that convert.Henry Eyster Jacobs: A Summary of the Christian Faith . Philadelphia: General Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America, 1905, pp. 216-17, The Formula of Concord teaches that when humans reject the calling of the Holy Spirit, it is not a result of the Word being less efficacious. Instead, contempt for the means of grace is the result of \\"the perverse will of man, which rejects or perverts the means and instrument of the Holy Ghost, which God offers him through the call, and resists the Holy Ghost, who wishes to be efficacious, and works through the Word...\\"Solid Declaration, article xi, \\"Election\\", par. 41 Lutherans are certain that the work of the Holy Spirit does not occur merely alongside the means of grace to regenerate, but instead is an integral part of them, always working through them wherever they are found. Lutherans teach that the Holy Spirit limits himself to working only through the means of grace and nowhere else,Smalcald Articles, part 8, \\"Of Confession\\": \\"[I]n those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one, except through or with the preceding outward Word.\\" so that those who reject the means of grace are simultaneously resisting and rejecting the Holy Spirit and the grace he brings. =Biblical passages related to the doctrine= The statement of St. Paul is said to confirm that those whom God effectually calls necessarily come to full salvation: \\"(T)hose whom (God) predestined He also called, and those whom He called He also justified, and those whom He justified He also glorified\\" (Romans 8:28,30). Of course, this confirmation depends upon the belief that when God elected certain individuals for salvation, He either did not know or did not consider who would respond and obey, though the Apostle Peter refers to the \\"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ\\". Calvinists also rely upon several verses from the sixth chapter of the Gospel of John, which contains a record of Jesus' teaching on humanity's abilities and God's activities in salvation, as the central proof text for the Calvinist doctrine: * John 6:37,39: \\"All that the Father gives me will come to me.... And this is the will of Him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that He has given me, but raise it up on the last day.\\"[ESV] * John 6:44‚Äì45: \\"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.... Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.\\"[ESV] * John 6:65: \\"(N)o one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.\\"[ESV] Proponents of Arminianism argue that the word \\"draw\\" (Greek: , helk√¥) as used in John 6:44 does not require the sense of \\"drag\\", though Calvinists teach this is the word's usual meaning (as in Jn. 18:10; 21:6; 21:11; Acts 16:19; 21:30; Jas. 2:6). They point to John 12:32 as an example: \\"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.\\" Many Arminians interpret this to mean that Jesus draws all people to Himself, but the draw only enables people to come to Him, since, if the call was truly irresistible, then all must come to Christ and be saved. They may also note that in the Septuagint version of Jeremiah 38:13, when Jeremiah is lifted out of the pit where he was left to die, this Greek verb is used for the action which his rescuers performed after he voluntarily secured the ropes under his armpits, and that this rescue was certainly performed in cooperation with Jeremiah's wishes and would have failed if he did not cooperate. Therefore, they may argue, even if the semantics of \\"draw\\" are understood in the usual sense, this should only be taken to indicate the source of the power, not the question of whether the person being drawn responds to the drawing, or to indicate that the drawing is done irrespective of their will. Calvinists argue that (1) the word \\"draw\\" should be understood according to its usual semantics in both John 6:44 and 12:32; (2) the word \\"all\\" (translated \\"all people\\" in v. 12:32) should be taken in the sense of \\"all kinds of people\\" rather than \\"every individual\\"; and thus (3) the former verse refers to an irresistible internal call to salvation and the latter to the opening of the Kingdom of God to the Gentiles, not a universal, resistible internal call. Of course, that argument requires acceptance of either the doctrine of Limited Atonement or universalism, since John 12:32 clearly states that \\"Jesus will draw all\\". Some have asserted on this basis that the text of John 6:44 can entail either universalism or Calvinism (inclusive of Limited Atonement), but not Arminianism. Arminian William Barclay argues that \\"man's resistance can defeat the pull of God\\" mentioned in John 6:44, but commentator Leon Morris contends that \\"(n)ot one of (Barclay's) examples of the verb ('draw') shows the resistance as successful. Indeed we can go further. There is not one example in the New Testament of the use of this verb where the resistance is successful. Always the drawing power is triumphant, as here.\\" Such arguments invite the criticism that Calvinists teach salvation by decree of God rather than justification by faith alone, that they \\"so zealously sought to guard the free grace of God in salvation that they denied faith any involvement at all in the actual justification of sinners.\\" But even if the drawing power is always triumphant, the ability to resist does not depend upon the meaning of the word \\"draw\\" in John 12:32, but on the question what the \\"draw\\" is intended to accomplish. Calvinism assumes that persons who Jesus \\"draws\\" will be regenerated. Arminianism states that all are drawn to Jesus to be given an enabling grace. \\"Jesus does not define what 'His drawing' will accomplish in John 12, only that He will do it.\\" Even if the semantics of \\"draw\\" are understood in the manner Calvinist's urge, this should only be taken to indicate the sufficiency of the power to draw (they were \\"not able to draw\\" as in John 21:6, or they were able to do so as in John 21:11), rather than to define what God does to those He draws. Arminians reject the Calvinist teaching that God draws for the purpose of forced regeneration irrespective of their wishes. Rather Arminians believe God draws all persons to provide all with an ability or enabling to believe, as prevenient grace teaches. History of the doctrine In the Catholic Church, debates concerning the respective role of efficacious grace and free will led to the establishment of the Congregatio de Auxiliis at the end of the 16th century by the Pope Clement VIII. The Dominicans insisted on the role of the efficacious grace, but the Jesuits embraced Molinism, which postulated greater liberty in the will. These debates also led to the famous formulary controversy in France which pitted the Jansenists against the Jesuits. The doctrine is one of the so-called Five points of Calvinism that were defined at the Synod of Dort during the Quinquarticular Controversy with the Arminian Remonstrants, who objected to the general predestinarian scheme of Calvinism, rejecting its denial of free will and its condemnation of the \\"majority of humanity for the sole purpose of torturing them in hell for all of eternity, and that they never had a choice\\". In Calvinist churches, the doctrine is most often mentioned in comparisons with other salvific schemes and their respective doctrines about the state of mankind after the Fall, and it is not a common topic for sermons or studies otherwise.

It currently travels for approximately from US 231/Alabama State Route 210 and US 231 Business (US 231 Bus.) and US 431 Bus. in Dothan, Alabama, to Owensboro, Kentucky, at US 60 and Kentucky Route 2831. Route description Map showing the south end in Dothan, AL =Alabama= U.S. 431 is paired with unsigned State Route1 throughout almost all of Alabama, with the exception of Dothan, where it is paired with signed State Route 210 around the eastern portion of the bypass named Ross Clark Circle. There is also a business route through downtown Dothan signed as Business US 431 and locally known as Reeves Street which runs into Business US 231. The two routes are signed concurrently through downtown and known locally as N. Oates Street north of Main Street (Business US 84) and S. Oates Street south of Main Street. The southern terminus of US 431 is at the intersection of US 231 and the business spurs on the south side of Ross Clark Circle. The route takes a rather meandering path through southeast Alabama. It heads in a northeast direction to pass through Phenix City near the Georgia state line, then cuts back to the west to pass through Opelika; the portion between Phenix City and Opelika is concurrent with U.S. Route 280. From Opelika, US 431 swings back and forth between northwest and northeast as it works its way through the southern extent of the Appalachian Mountains, then turning northwest to pass through Talladega National Forest, arriving at a junction with Interstate 20 a few miles east of Oxford. The combined routes travel westward from Exit 191 into Oxford, where US 431 splits off at Exit 188 and heads northward through Oxford and the adjacent city of Anniston; through this section the route is named Veterans Memorial Parkway. From Anniston, US 431 heads northwards towards Gadsden. In East Gadsden, it combines with U.S. Route 278; the combined route passes westward through Gadsden and Attalla before splitting just northwest of Attalla. This route is named Meighan Boulevard in Gadsden and Fifth Avenue in Attalla until reaching US 11. In downtown Attalla, the route shares a brief wrong-way concurrency with US 11. West of Attalla, US 431 again turns to the northwest. At Guntersville, it joins with Alabama State Route 79. Through downtown Guntersville the route is divided into two separate one-way streets; the northbound street is named Blount Avenue, and the southbound street is Gunter Avenue. At the northern edge of Guntersville, the split streets combine and the joint route crosses the Tennessee River via the George S. Houston Bridge, before US 431 splits off and again heads in a northwest direction. At Huntsville, US 431 passes over Monte Sano Mountain and through Huntsville's medical district before reaching Memorial Parkway; this portion of the route forms a portion of Governors Drive. At the Parkway, the route joins with U.S. Route 231; the combined routes then travel northward to the Tennessee state line. =Tennessee= US 431 northbound on Hillsboro Pike in Nashville A few miles north of the state line, in Fayetteville, US 231 and 431 split again, with 431 heading northwest in combination with State Route 50. In the town of Petersburg, the combined route briefly joins with State Route 129; the trio head a few miles northwest before SR-129 splits off to the west. From here, US 431/SR 50 travels through mountainous and largely undeveloped territory in south central Tennessee until arriving in Lewisburg. On the east side of Lewisburg, it joins with U.S. Route 31A; the combined routes form part of a bypass around the eastern side of Lewisburg. This portion is named Ellington Parkway, and it forms brief unions with State Routes 272 and 11, plus a longer-lasting combination with State Route 106. Meanwhile, SR 50 splits off to travel through downtown Lewisburg, rejoining US 431 on the north side of town. On the north side of Lewisburg, US 31A splits off, and then a few miles later SR-50 splits off, while US 431 and SR-106 jointly continue north. The route pair, variously known through this section as Lewisburg Pike or Franklin Pike, eventually passes underneath Interstate 65 to enter the town of Franklin. Continuing north, the route pair passes through the exclusive Nashville subdivision of Brentwood before entering Nashville proper. The route skirts the campus of Vanderbilt University before entering downtown Nashville from the southwest. Crossing under Interstate 40 (where SR-106 ends), the route follows Broadway to its intersection with Rosa L. Parks Boulevard. Here the route makes a left turn towards the northwest, joining with U.S. Route 31 and U.S. Route 41 and several state routes. The route snakes around the state capitol and crosses the Cumberland River going northwest as James Robertson Parkway. In east Nashville, the route crosses under Interstate 24, then follows Spring Street and then Dickerson Pike northward. At Whites Creek Pike, US 431 splits off from the other routes, heading westward back across north Nashville and then north out of Nashville. In combination with State Route 65, it heads to Springfield, where it again joins with US-41 and SR-11. The combined routes pass north through Springfield, and then US-431/SR-65 split off and head north to the Kentucky state line. =Kentucky= Looking south toward the Livermore Bridge, with the Ohio County peninsula in the middle of the river U.S. 431 enters Kentucky south of Adairville, where it runs north into Russellville. It continues through Russellville northbound where many new re-construction projects have widened it to a four-lane highway. U.S. 431 continues its northward journey passing through many small towns when it enters Drakesboro, after which it follows most of its original route into Central City. In Central City, U.S. 431 has a cloverleaf intersection (a former toll plaza when the parkway was toll) with the Western Kentucky Parkway. The route continues north and intersects with U.S. 62 where it then parallels the route in a westerly direction to a western bypass around the central business district of Central City, in which city it is named in honor of the Everly Brothers, locally-born prominent singers. U.S. 431 turns north at the Kentucky Route 189 and U.S. 62 bypass and continues on through many small farming communities of Muhlenberg and McLean counties. After bisecting many rural rolling hills and farms of the Western Coal Fields as well as crossing through river lowlands of the Ohio Valley on its journey to Daviess County, it enters the city of Owensboro as a four-lane highway and one of the main arterial roads into the city. Many shopping centers line its outer reaches in Owensboro. As of mid-2010, U.S. 431 now officially terminates at the former US 60 By-Pass (Wendell H. Ford Expressway) on Owensboro's south side, following AASHTO's approval of Kentucky's renumbering of the US 60 By-Pass as simply U.S. 60. The former route of U.S. 60 through downtown Owensboro (Second and Fourth streets) is to be turned over to the city and made more \\"pedestrian-friendly\\" as part of the city's latest downtown revitalization plan. In early 2011, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet renumbered the former section of U.S. 431 from US 60 to Fifth Street in Owensboro as Kentucky Route 2831. A small portion of U.S. 431 is famous for a unique reason. U.S. 431 crosses the Green River in McLean County, Kentucky. It is at that crossing in the city of Livermore that U.S. 431 crosses two rivers and also crosses into Ohio County before completing the river crossing back in McLean County. This is the only known crossing of this type in the United States: a road starts in one county, crosses two separate rivers, crosses a sliver of land within another county, and then terminates the bridge crossing in the original county it started in. This special feature is marked by a state historical marker on both approach ends of the bridge. History U.S. Route 241 (US 241) was formed in 1930, splitting from US 41 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee and heading south to US 231 in Dothan, Alabama. The route of the highway went south through Shelbyville and Fayetteville to Huntsville. From Huntsville, the highway snaked through Owens Cross Roads and New Hope (on a road currently named \\"Old Highway 431\\") on its way to Guntersville, then through Albertville and Boaz (on what is now SR 205) on its way to Gadsden, then to Anniston and Oxford. After US 231 was extended through north Alabama and Tennessee through Huntsville to Murfreesboro around 1952, the northern terminus of US 241 was truncated to Huntsville. In 1953, since US 241 began and ended in Alabama, it was decommissioned. However, US 431 was being extended southward from Kentucky through Tennessee and Alabama, so the lost section from Huntsville to Oxford gained the US 431 designation. However, from Oxford, US 241 traveled through Talladega, Sylacauga, Goodwater, Alexander, and Opelika, but US 431 was not routed onto this section, but onto the SR 37 route, which was a shorter route to Opelika. However, the Sylacauga to Opelika section did gain the US 280 designation.

It developed as a technological merger of local neolithic and mesolithic techno-complexes between the lower Elbe and middle Vistula rivers, introducing farming and husbandry as a major source of food to the pottery- using hunter-gatherers north of this line. It was preceded by Lengyel- influenced Stroke-ornamented ware culture (STK) groups/Late Lengyel and Baden- Boler√°z in the southeast, R√∂ssen groups in the southwest and the Erteb√∏lle- Ellerbek groups in the north. The TRB techno-complex is divided into a northern group including modern northern Germany and southern Scandinavia (TRB-N, roughly the area that previously belonged to the Erteb√∏lle-Ellerbek complex), a western group in the Netherlands between the Zuiderzee and lower Elbe that originated in the Swifterbant culture, an eastern group centered on the Vistula catchment, roughly ranging from Oder to Bug, and south-central groups (TRB-MES, Altmark) around the middle and upper Elbe and Saale. Especially in the southern and eastern groups, local sequences of variants emerged. In the late 4th millennium BC, the Globular Amphora culture (GAC) replaced most of the eastern and subsequently also the southern TRB groups, reducing the TRB area to modern northern Germany and southern Scandinavia. The younger TRB in these areas was superseded by the Single Grave culture (EGK) at about 2800 BC. The north-central European megaliths were built primarily during the TRB era. Nomenclature The Funnelbeaker culture is named for its characteristic ceramics, beakers and amphorae with funnel-shaped tops, which were found in dolmen burials. History The Funnelbeaker culture emerged in northern modern-day Germany c. 4100 BC. Archaeological evidence strongly suggests that it originated through a migration of colonists from the Michelsberg culture of Central Europe. The Michelsberg culture is archaeologically and genetically strongly differentiated from the preceding post-Linear Pottery cultures of Central Europe, being distinguished by increased levels of hunter-gatherer ancestry. Its people were probably descended from farmers migrating into Central Europe out of Iberia and modern- day France, who in turn were descended from farmers of the Cardial Ware cultures who had migrated westwards from the Balkans along the Mediterranean coast. Connections between the Funnelbeakers and these farmers of the Atlantic coast is supported by genetic evidence. After its establishment, the Funnelbeaker culture rapidly spreads into southern Scandinavia and Poland, in what appears to have been a well organized colonizing venture. In southern Scandinavia it replaces the Erteb√∏lle culture, which had maintained a Mesolithic lifestyle for about 1500 years after farming arrived in Central Europe. The emergence of the Neolithic British Isles through maritime colonization by Michelsberg-related groups occurs almost at the same time as the expansion of the Funnelbeaker culture into Scandinavia, suggesting that these events may be connected. Although they were largely of Early European Farmer (EEF) descent, people of the Funnelbeaker culture have a relatively high amount of hunter-gatherer admixture, particularly in Scandinavia, suggesting that hunter-gatherer populations were partially incorporated into it during its expansion into this region. During later phases of the Neolithic, the Funnelbeaker culture re-expands out of Scandinavia southwards into Central Europe, establishing several regional varieties. This expansion appears to have been accompanied by significant human migration.. \\"The H-G legacy resurgence observed in the Bernburg context has been linked to the important admixture demonstrated between H-G and farmers in Scandinavia (in the North European Plain), one millennium earlier, in the context of the emergence of the Funnel Beaker Culture... The Bernburg groups, a late representative of the TRB groups in Central Europe, must have inherited their important frequencies of H-G haplogroups from their northern ancestors. The southward expansion of the Funnelbeaker culture is accompanied by a substantial increase in hunter-gatherer lineages in Central Europe. The Funnelbeaker communities in Central Europe which emerged were probably quite genetically and ethnically mixed, and archaeological evidence suggests that they were relatively violent.. \\"The hunter-gatherer groups of central Europe apparently largely retreated to northern Europe when the early farmers arrived. From a genetic perspective, there was hardly any admixture between indigenous groups and migrant opopulations in the Early Neolithic, and the same can be said for the Carpatian Basin. It was not until the 4th millennium BCE that there was a population reflux of hunter-gatherer lineages by way of the Funnel Beaker Cultures from southern Scandinavia into central Europe. The encounter of these two worlds that in some ways were ethnically and culturally quite diverse, was characterized by an increase in violent events throughout Europe. However, this general development notwithstanding, certain parallel communities of hunter-gatherers and farmers were also established in some places. The introgression of the Funnel Beaker Culture in the 4th millennium BCE, appears to have marked the beginning of a heterogenous multi-ethnic society at least from a genetic point of view.\\" From the middle of the 4th millenium BC, the Funnelbeaker culture is gradually replaced by the Globular Amphora culture on its southeastern fringes, and begins to decline in Scandinavia, where it is replaced throughout coastal areas by the Pitted Ware culture, whose people were hunter-gatherers who were genetically unrelated to the Funnelbeakers. In the early 3rd millennium BC, the Corded Ware culture appears in Northern Europe. Its peoples were of marked steppe-related ancestry and traced their origins in cultures further east. This period is distinguished by the construction of numerous defensive palisades in Funnelbeaker territory, which may be a sign of violent conflict between the Funnelbeakers, Corded Ware and Pitted Ware. By 2650 BC, the Funnelbeaker culture had been replaced by the Corded Ware culture. Genetic studies suggest that Funnelbeaker women were incorporated into the Corded Ware culture through intermixing with incoming Corded Ware males, and that people of the Corded Ware culture continued to use Funnelbeaker megaliths as burial grounds. Subsequent cultures of Late Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age Central Europe display strong maternal genetic affinity with the Funnelbeaker culture. Distribution The TRB ranges from the Elbe catchment in Germany and Bohemia with a western extension into the Netherlands, to southern Scandinavia (Denmark up to Uppland in Sweden and the Oslofjord in Norway) in the north and to the Vistula catchment in today's Poland in the east. Variants of the Funnelbeaker culture in or near the Elbe catchment area include the Tiefstich pottery group in northern Germany as well as the cultures of the Baalberge group (TRB-MES II and III; MES = Mittelelbe-Saale), the Salzm√ºnde and Walternienburg and Bernburg (all TRB-MES IV) whose centres were in Saxony- Anhalt. Characteristics =Settlements= With the exception of some inland settlements such as Alvastra pile-dwelling, the settlements are located near those of the previous Erteb√∏lle culture on the coast. It was characterised by single-family daubed houses c. 12 m x 6 m. In Olszanica 5000 BCE a longhouse was constructed with 2.2 m wide doors, presumably for wagon entry. This building was 40 m long with 3 doors.\\"Olszanica Longhouse\\" =Economy= The Funnelbeaker culture was dominated by animal husbandry of sheep, cattle, pigs and goats, but there was also hunting and fishing. Primitive wheat and barley was grown on small patches that were fast depleted, due to which the population frequently moved small distances. There was also mining (in the Malm√∂ region) and collection of flintstone (≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains), which was traded into regions lacking the stone, such as the Scandinavian hinterland. The culture used copper from Silesia, especially daggers and axes. =Technology= The Funnel Beaker Culture preserves the oldest dated evidence of wheeled vehicles in middle Europe. One example is the engraving on a ceramic tureen from Bronocice on the northern edge of the Beskydy Mountains (northern Carpathian ring), which is indirectly dated to 3636 - 3373 BC and is the oldest evidence of knowledge of covered carriages in Central Europe.Holm, Hans J.

Burial practices were varied, depending on region and changed over time. Inhumation seems to have been the rule. The oldest graves consisted of wooden chambered cairns inside long barrows, but were later made in the form of passage graves and dolmens. Originally, the structures were probably covered with a mound of earth and the entrance was blocked by a stone. The Funnelbeaker culture marks the appearance of megalithic tombs at the coasts of the Baltic and of the North sea, an example of which are the Sieben Steinh√§user in northern Germany. The megalithic structures of Ireland, France and Portugal are somewhat older and have been connected to earlier archeological cultures of those areas. At graves, the people sacrificed ceramic vessels that contained food along with amber jewelry and flint-axes. =Religion= Flint-axes and vessels were also deposited in streams and lakes near the farmlands, and virtually all Sweden's 10,000 flint axes that have been found from this culture were probably sacrificed in water. They also constructed large cult centres surrounded by pales, earthworks and moats. The largest one is found at Sarup on Fyn. It comprises 85,000 m2 and is estimated to have taken 8000 workdays. Another cult centre at St√§vie near Lund comprises 30,000 m2. Ethnicity In the context of the Kurgan hypothesis (or steppe hypothesis), the culture is seen as non- Indo-European, representing a culture of Neolithic origin, as opposed to the Indo-European-language-speaking peoples (see Yamna culture) who later intruded from the east.Iversen, R. & Kroonen, G. 2017. Talking Neolithic: Linguistic and Archaeological Perspectives on how Indo-European was Implemented in Southern Scandinavia. American Journal of Archaeology, vol. 121, no. 4, p. 511‚Äì525. Marija Gimbutas postulated that the political relationship between the aboriginal and intrusive cultures resulted in quick and smooth cultural morphosis into the Corded Ware culture. A number of other archaeologists in the past have proposed that the Corded Ware culture was a purely local development of the Funnelbeaker culture,For example Pre- & protohistorie van de lage landen, onder redactie van J.H.F.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 104: pp. 3736‚Äì3741, indicated that the genetic variant that causes lactase persistence in most Europeans (‚Äì13,910*T) was rare or absent in early farmers from central Europe. A study published by Yuval Itan and colleagues in 2010Yuval Itan, Bryony L. Jones, Catherine J. E. Ingram, Dallas M. Swallow and Mark G. Thomas (2010), A worldwide correlation of lactase persistence phenotype and genotypes, BMC Evolutionary Biology 10, no. 36, pp. 1‚Äì11. clearly shows this. A study published in 2009, also by Itan et al., suggests that the Linear Pottery culture (also known as Linearbandkeramik or LBK), which preceded the TRB culture by some 1,500 years, was the culture in which this trait started to co-evolve with the culture of dairying. All genetic finds in the following are assigned to the Funnelbeaker (TrB) culture. examined 3 skeletons from G√∂khem, Sweden which belonged to the maternal haplogroups H, J and T. examined another skeleton from G√∂khem, Sweden. He was found to be a carrier of the maternal haplogroup H. He was mostly genetically similar to modern Southern Europeans, while people of the Pitted Ware culture and other hunter-gatherers examined were found to be most genetically similar to modern Northern Europeans. found that the Funnelbeaker culture of Scandinavia had a higher amount of hunter-gatherer maternal lineages than other cultures of Middle Neolithic Europe. They also found that the emergence of the Bernburg culture, a late variant of the Funnelbeaker culture in Central Europe, was accompanied by a genetic shift towards the population of Northern Europe, which was detected by significantly increased amount of hunther- gatherer lineages. again examined 3 skeletons from G√∂khem, Sweden c. 5050-4750 BC. The 3 samples belonged to the maternal haplogroups H1c, K1e and H24. The study found hunter-gatherer admixture among the Funnelbeakers, but no evidence of Funnebeaker admixture among the Pitted Ware. examined 9 skeletons from Resmo, Sweden and G√∂khem, Sweden c. 3300-2600 BC. The 8 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to various subtypes of maternal haplogroup J, H/R, N, K and T. The examined Funnelbeakers were closely related to Central European farmers, and different from people of the contemporary Pitted Ware culture. The striking diversity of the maternal lineages suggested that maternal kinship was of little importance in Funnelbeaker society. The evidence suggested that the Neolithization of Scandinavia was accompanied by significant human migration. analysed 3 skeletons of the Baalberge group of the Funnelbeaker culture. Two samples belonged to Y-haplogroup I and R1b1a, while the 3 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroup H1e1a, HV and T2e1. A male of the Salzm√ºnde/Bernburg groups of the Funnelbeaker culture buried in Esperstedt, c. 3360-3086 BC was also examined. He carried the Y-haplogroup I2a1b1a1 and the maternal haplogroup T2b. examined 3 skeletons ascribed to the Salzm√ºnde group of the Funnelbeaker culture. The 2 samples belonged to Y-haplogroup G2a2a1 and IJK, while the 3 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroup H2 (2 samples) and U3a1. examined an early Funnelbeaker female skeleton from Kv√§rl√∂v, Sweden ca. 3945‚Äì3647 BC. She carried maternal haplogroup T2b. She was closely related to people of the Linear Pottery culture, but with increased level of hunter-gatherer admixture, which is comparable to other Middle Neolithic and Chalcolithic farmers of Europe. Genetic continuity with later Funnelbeaker samples was detected. Her hunter-gatherer admixture appeared to have been derived from a Western Hunter- Gatherer (WHG) or Baltic Hunter-Gatherer source rather than a Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer (SHG) source. Slight traces of Funnelbeaker ancestry was detected among the PWC. examined 9 skeletons from a megalith in Ansarve on the island of Gotland, Sweden c. 3500-2580 BC. The 4 samples Y-haplogroups I2a1b1a1 (3 samples) and I2a1b, while the 9 samples of mtDNA belonged to the maternal haplogroups K1a, K1a2b, T2b8, J1c5, HV0a, J1c8a and K2b1a (2 samples). They were found to be mostly of Early European Farmer (EEF) descent, but with significant hunter-gatherer ancestry, which appeared to be primarily male-derived. Their paternal lineage I is of hunter-gatherer origin, and people examined from contemporary megaliths in other parts of western Europe also belonged to this lineage. The uniformity of the paternal lineages suggested that these peoples belonged to a patrilineal and socially stratified society. They were found to be more closely related peoples of Neolithic Britain than peoples of Neolithic Central Europe, suggesting that they derived much of their ancestry from people who migrated along the European Atlantic coast. examined 2 skeletons from R√∂ssberga, √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden c. 3330-2920 BC. The 1 sample Y-haplogroup IJ-M429*, while the 2 samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroup J1c5 and U3a‚Äôc. They were found to be genetically related to Central European farmers of the Middle Neolithic, and were clearly differentiated from people of the contemporary Pitted Ware culture and the succeeding Battle Axe culture. People buried in Funnelbeaker megaliths during the time of the Battle Axe culture were found to be most closely related to Battle Axe people. Traces of Funnelbeaker admixture was however detected among the Battle Axe people. The evidence suggested that the Battle Axe culture entered Scandinavia through a migration from Eastern Europe, after which Battle Axe males mixed with Funnelbeaker females. found that the Funnelbeaker culture was mostly of Early European Farmer (EEF) ancestry. Among Funnelbeakers in Scandinavia, hunter-gatherer ancestry was estimated to be at about 50%, while in Central Europe it was at about 40%, with the remaining being EEF. Samples from the latest phases of the Funnelbeaker culture contained higher amounts of hunter-gatherer ancestry. The hunter-gatherers of the Pitted Ware culture, who displaced the Funnelbeakers throughout the coasts of southern Scandinavia, were found to carry slight amount of Funnelbeaker admixture.

Key features of ludics include notion of compound connectives, using a technique known as focusing or focalisation (invented by the computer scientist Jean-Marc Andreoli), and its use of locations or loci over a base instead of propositions. More precisely, ludics tries to retrieve known logical connectives and proof behaviours by following the paradigm of interactive computation, similarly to what is done in game semantics to which it is closely related. By abstracting the notion of formulae and focusing of their concrete uses -- that is distinct occurrences -- it provides an abstract syntax for computer science, as loci can be seen as pointers on memory. The primary achievement of ludics is the discovery of a relationship between two natural, but distinct notions of type, or proposition. The first view, which might be termed the proof-theoretic or Gentzen-style interpretation of propositions, says that the meaning of a proposition arises from its introduction and elimination rules. Focalization refines this viewpoint by distinguishing between positive propositions, whose meaning arises from their introduction rules, and negative propositions, whose meaning arises from their elimination rules. In focused calculi, it is possible to define positive connectives by giving only their introduction rules, with the shape of the elimination rules being forced by this choice. (Symmetrically, negative connectives can be defined in focused calculi by giving only the elimination rules, with the introduction rules forced by this choice.) The second view, which might be termed the computational or Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of propositions, takes the view that we fix a computational system up front, and then give a realizability interpretation of propositions to give them constructive content. For example, a realizer for the proposition \\"A implies B\\" is a computable function which takes a realizer for A, and uses it to compute a realizer for B. Realizability models characterize realizers for propositions in terms of their visible behavior, and not in terms of their internal structure. Girard shows that for second-order affine linear logic, given a computational system with nontermination and error stops as effects, realizability and focalization give the same meaning to types. Ludics was proposed by the logician Jean-Yves Girard. His paper introducing Ludics, Locus solum: from the rules of logic to the logic of rules, has some features that may be seen as eccentric for a publication in mathematical logic (such as illustrations of Positive Skunks). It has to be noted that the intent of these features is to enforce the point of view of Jean-Yves Girard at the time of its writing. And, thus, it offers to readers the possibility to understand ludics independently of their backgrounds.

It passes through Beatrice and exits the state at Brownville via the Brownville Bridge. It is designated the Heritage Highway throughout Nebraska. =Missouri= US 136 runs east in Rock Port, Missouri US 136 enters Missouri on the west just east of Brownville, Nebraska, over the Missouri River. It leaves the state at Alexandria on the east, running concurrently with US 61\\\\. During its journey, it enters every county seat in the nine counties it traverses. The distance across Missouri is approximately . US 136 is two lanes over its entire course through Missouri. =Iowa= US 136 in Iowa consists of a route which travels across the south-easternmost tip of Lee County. It crosses the Des Moines River from Missouri with US 61, overlapping for just over . East of the US 61 split, US 136 is overlapped by US 61 Bus. through Keokuk. US 136 enters Keokuk along 7th Street, which takes a turn to the northeast towards downtown. At the intersection with Main Street, which is the southern end of US 218, it turns to the southeast towards the Mississippi River. US 136 travels another before crossing the Mississippi into Hamilton, Illinois via the Keokuk‚ÄìHamilton Bridge. =Illinois= US 136 spends within the state of Illinois. It crosses the Mississippi River into Illinois from Iowa just past Keokuk. It passes through historic Carthage; site of the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement and home of the Kibbe biological museum, then Macomb, where Western Illinois University is located. It continues as an east‚Äìwest route intersecting with I-155 and I-55 south of Bloomington-Normal and north of Lincoln in Central Illinois. It later intersects with I-74, and then I-57 just outside Rantoul, approximately north of Champaign-Urbana. US 136 then travels concurrently with Illinois Route 1 in far east central Illinois before entering Danville. At Danville, it turns east as it passes into Indiana. =Indiana= Through most of its duration in Indiana, US 136 parallels I-74. Within Indianapolis, the highway is also called Crawfordsville Road, and US 136 ends in the town of Speedway, at the I-74/I-465 interchange, where Crawfordsville Road continues without numbered designation. As part of Indiana's Accelerate 465 project, the I-74/I-465 interchange was being reworked to eliminate tight spiral ramps and to add a full interchange for US 136 with I-465. It was completed in 2014. The entire portion of US 136 in Indiana is part of the Dixie Highway. History In Illinois, the designation of US 136 in 1951 replaced IL 10 from the Iowa state line in Keokuk to IL 119 in Havana, The route then followed IL 119 to an intersection with IL 1, where it traveled south to IL 10, heading east to Danville and the Indiana state line. In Missouri, most of US 136 was designated as Route 4 in 1922. This highway began at St. Joseph and followed present US 169 to Stanberry, turning east there to the Iowa state line along US 136\\\\. The rest of US 136 was initially Route 1A (Nebraska to Rock Port), part of Route 1, and Route 18 (Tarkio to Stanberry). The east end was truncated to Wayland in 1926, when US 61 was designated over the part east to Iowa, and in 1927 Route 4 absorbed the former Route 52 from St. Joseph southwest to Atchison, Kansas. In 1932, Route 4 was rerouted west of Stanberry, absorbing Route 18 and Route 102 (the latter a ca. 1930 renumbering of Route 1A); the portion from Stanberry to St. Joseph was deleted in favor of US 169 and the portion from St. Joseph to Kansas became Route 18 (which became part of US 59 in 1934).

He was the candidate of the alliance between his party and the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) in the 2006 Mexican presidential election. Early years Madrazo was born in Villahermosa, Tabasco, to Carlos A. Madrazo and Graciela Pintado Jim√©nez. His father was a reformist politician at a time when the PRI was the only viable party. Both of his parents died in a plane crash when he was sixteen. Although his father came from humble roots, his prestige allowed Roberto to become one of Mexico's elite. He studied law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City and urbanism at the University of California at Los Angeles, and headed the PRI Youth. Between 1976 and 1988, he represented Tabasco in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. He served as governor of Tabasco from 1994-2000 and president of the PRI from 2002-2005\\\\. Madrazo is mainly credited for bringing cohesion to a disjointed PRI after it historically lost the 2000 presidential election. Madrazo was able to wrestle control of the PRI by negotiating deals with different power groups within the PRI and by neutralizing political adversaries within the party. He is married to Isabel de la Parra Trillo. 2000 presidential election Madrazo sought the PRI's presidential candidacy in 2000 but lost to Francisco Labastida, a former governor of Sinaloa and former Secretary of the Interior in the cabinet of President Ernesto Zedillo, whom Madrazo perceived as having chosen Labastida as his successor in the Mexican political tradition of the dedazo (\\"the finger\\", referring to hand-chosen presidential succession). The PRI had never lost a presidential election since its founding, and the party's structure made the president the arbiter of its internal affairs. Although this was not the first time in PRI's history the presidential authority was defied, Madrazo's anti-dedazo campaign was particularly aggressive. He even used a pun on his surname (a \\"madrazo\\" is vulgar term for a severe blow in Mexican Spanish) as a promise to end the corrupt tradition when he said he would strike a \\"madrazo\\" against the \\"dedazo\\". He attracted some followers inside the PRI but the primary, which, in an unprecedented turn of events, was open to registered voters and not just PRI members, favored Labastida. Madrazo accepted the outcome, but his aggressive internal campaign had weakened Labastida's candidacy in the eyes of the electorate, and was seen as a major factor in his defeat by the National Action Party (PAN) candidate Vicente Fox Quesada. After the historical loss of the presidential election in 2000, the PRI was faced an uncertain future. Madrazo, however, as party leader, was able to parlay the party's strong infrastructure and history into electoral victories, particularly in his home state of Tabasco, which helped avoid internecine troubles. PRI presidency Santiago Creel (left), President Vicente Fox and Roberto Madrazo (right). Madrazo ran for the presidency of the PRI in 2002, allying himself with Elba Esther Gordillo (as his general secretary), the powerful leader of the National Education Workers' Union. Together, they defeated their adversary, Senator Beatriz Paredes in a close election. After the election, Gordillo became his political rival, resulting in her retirement from public life for a year amidst many verbal accusations (she was accused of murdering members of her labor-based opposition and conspiring against PRI members). In early 2005, Gordillo returned to the political scene and broke publicly with Madrazo. 2006 presidential campaign Madrazo's position as national leader of the PRI has given him a considerable advantage in his campaign for the 2006 presidential candidacy. As the election neared, there had been a growing discomfort among other would-be PRI candidates, who had increasingly demanded clear rules for the internal campaign be set. Many PRI-affiliated state governors formed the group Democratic Unity, nicknamed TUCOM (Todos Unidos Contra Madrazo, \\"All United Against Madrazo\\") in the media. They chose Arturo Montiel as their pre- candidate. In the primary elections, Madrazo, Montiel, and a third contender, Everardo Moreno Cruz, competed for the candidacy. Montiel resigned after legal issues concerning mansions in Mexico and France (his wife is a French citizen); his sons were also implicated in embezzlement schemes. Montiel's resignation resulted in Madrazo's candidacy, although minimal participation on the part of the PRI votership may have indicated a lack of faith in the PRI or a general disinterest. Lately he has been accused by political rivals of tax evasion. After the primaries, Madrazo forged an alliance with the PVEM, and earned the party's nomination. Madrazo faced a battle against Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, the former Head of Government of the Federal District and PRD presidential candidate. L√≥pez Obrador was something of a personal rival, having previously lost to Madrazo in the election for the Tabasco governorship in 1994. Another contestant was the right-of-center PAN candidate Felipe Calder√≥n. The public debate between Madrazo and Gordillo resulted in the creation of a new political party, the Partido Nueva Alianza, formed to oppose Madrazo in his bid for the presidency. For this she was suspended in her rights as a PRI \\"militant\\" (an official party position) pending an expulsion process. Gordillo has made it clear that she believes Madrazo is not a viable candidate for Mexico's presidency. The Nueva Alianza candidate, Roberto Campa, spent much of the first presidential debate attacking Madrazo. Shortly after Gordillo's denunciation, the Mexico City newspaper Reforma published an article that condemned Madrazo as the owner of a luxury penthouse in a prestigious highrise tower in Miami worth eight million pesos ($800,000 U.S. dollars) and three luxury apartments in Mexico City with the alleged value of seven million pesos. However, Madrazo's public declaration of assets, liabilities and expenses of January 19, 2006, denies the allegations. Going into the elections, Madrazo polled at 30 percent. On July 3, 2006, Madrazo and his coalition conceded defeat in the presidential election. According to official results, he received only 22.26% of the vote or 9,301,441 votes out of 41,791,322 votes‚Äîthe PRI's worst presidential result to that point. Berlin Marathon scam Madrazo was accused of cheating during the 2007 Berlin Marathon. Posting a time of 2 hours and 41 minutes, his time was 36 minutes slower than the world record at the time. His 25 and 30 km checkpoints were unregistered. Madrazo finished the race in 146th place, and allegedly took 21 minutes to cover the 15 kilometers between the 20 km and 35 km marks, while the world record for this distance is 41 minutes. The cheating was revealed because the time registration of start, finish, and all split times of the marathon was done by transponder timing. Eventually Madrazo was disqualified, causing a political disturbance in Mexico.

Its eastern boundary is arbitrarily defined. As is the case with the other eight U.S. states that have panhandles, the geographic meaning of the term is inexact and elastic. References to the Florida Panhandle always include the ten counties west of the Apalachicola River, a natural geographic boundary, which was the historic dividing line between the British colonies of West Florida and East Florida. These western counties also lie in the Central Time Zone (with the exception of Gulf County, which is divided between the Eastern and Central Time zones), while the rest of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone. References to the Panhandle may also include some or all of eleven counties immediately east of the Apalachicola known as the Big Bend region, along the curve of Apalachee Bay. Like North Central Florida, the Panhandle is more similar in culture and climate to the Deep South than to South Florida in the lower peninsula, being known for its conservative politics and \\"piney woods.\\" A Newsweek article in 1972, referring to then United States Senator Lawton Chiles, said \\"In 1958, he was elected to the state legislature from the ultraconservative piney-woods panhandle of Florida.\\" The largest city in the Panhandle is Tallahassee, the state capital, population 188,107 (2014). However, the largest population grouping is the Pensacola Metropolitan Area with a population of 494,883 (2018). The total population of the Panhandle, as of the 2010 Census, was 1,407,925, just under 7.5% of Florida's total population as recorded in the same census. Coastal regions =Emerald Coast= Location of Florida's Emerald Coast Beach in Destin Emerald Coast, a term coined in 1983,\\"Who owns 'Emerald Coast'?\\" , Northwest Florida Daily News, June 29, 2011, accessed July 10, 2011. refers in general to the beaches and coastal resorts from Pensacola to Port St. Joe, but is sometimes used to refer, by extension, to the Panhandle as a whole, especially west of the Apalachicola.

Coastal regions of the following counties (if not the entirety of the counties themselves) are usually included when referring to the Forgotten Coast: * Gulf County * Franklin County * Wakulla County * Small portions of Bay County Physical features The Apalachicola River is the largest river of the Panhandle. It is formed by the junction of several rivers, including the Chattahoochee and the Flint, where the boundaries of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida meet. From there, it flows southward to the town of Apalachicola. Major estuaries include, from west to east: Perdido Bay, fed by the Perdido River, which forms the western boundary of Florida; Escambia Bay and East Bay, fed by the Escambia River and Blackwater River, respectively; Choctawhatchee Bay, fed by the Choctawhatchee River; and St. Andrews Bay, fed by Econfina Creek. Pensacola Bay, a deepwater port, is formed by the joining of Escambia and East bays. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, completed in 1949, traverses the lower Panhandle by means of bays, lagoons, sounds, and man-made canals. The barrier islands of Perdido Key and Santa Rosa Island extend from the Pandhandle's western extremity through Fort Walton Beach to Destin. History =19th century= Throughout the 19th century, the Panhandle was sparsely populated, dotted in places with small farming communities, none of which had as many as a thousand residents. Many Panhandle residents had, in fact, migrated to the area from Alabama and had relatives there; it was also easier to trade with and travel to southern Alabama than to reach East Florida by slow, arduous journey across the thick cypress swamps and dense pine forests of the Panhandle. It was natural for West Floridians to feel that they had more in common with their nearby neighbors in Alabama than with the residents of the peninsula, hundreds of miles away. In 1821, Pensacola was the only city (in 19th-century terms) in West Florida, with a population estimated to be about 3,000. In the 1850 census, the enumerated population of Pensacola was 2,164 (including 741 slaves and 350 \\"free Negroes\\").Herbert J. Doherty, \\"Ante-bellum Pensacola: 1821‚Äì1860, Florida Historical Quarterly, January 1959 Alabama annexation proposals During the course of the century, proposals for ceding the Florida counties west of the Apalachicola River to Alabama were often raised: *In 1811, while Florida was still a Spanish possession, US migrants residing in the territory sent a petition to Congress asking to be incorporated into the Mississippi Territory, which at that time included present-day Alabama. (See West Florida article.) *In 1819, the constitutional convention of Alabama asked Congress to include West Florida in their new state. *In 1822, only a year after the U.S. acquired the entire Florida territory from Spain, residents of West Florida sent a petition to the U.S. House of Representatives asking that their section be annexed to Alabama, and Alabama Senator John Williams Walker also promoted the idea. *In 1826, the Pensacola Gazette published a number of letters advocating annexation to Alabama, though the editor remarked that some Pensacolians opposed the idea. *In 1840, a public meeting in Pensacola produced a demand that West Florida be united with Alabama. In the same year, the territorial Legislature notified Congress that it opposed allowing Alabama to annex West Florida, but in 1844, the year before statehood, the Legislature reversed its stance and asked that West Florida be separated. *In 1856, advocates of annexation were able to get a bill passed by the Legislature authorizing a referendum on the issue, but Governor James E. Broome vetoed the measure. The Pensacola Gazette reported that \\"annexation is desired by a large majority of the people\\" of the area. *In 1858, the Alabama Legislature unsuccessfully tried to open negotiations with Florida on the subject. *The annexation issue was eclipsed by the Civil War and the war's effects on the region, but in 1868, with Pensacola now connected by the Panhandle's sole railroad line to the Alabama cities of Mobile and Montgomery, the issue came to a head again and was finally put to a vote of the people. In that year, the Alabama Legislature approved a joint resolution authorizing their Governor to negotiate with the Governor of Florida about the annexation of West Florida. An offer of one million dollars in Alabama state bonds, paying 8 percent interest for thirty years, was included. Both states appointed commissioners to make detailed recommendations on the matter. *On November 2, 1869, a referendum was held in the West Florida counties (except Jackson, which was in the throes of bloody racial violence), with a result of 1162 to 661 in favor of annexation. However, political objection developed in Alabama to the high price, and the Legislature took no action on the results of the referendum. *In 1873, a similar proposal was made in the Alabama Legislature, which the state senate approved, though it did not pass a separate proposal to finance the measure by selling all of Alabama's territory west of the Tombigbee River, including the city of Mobile, to Mississippi. However, nothing came of this action. *In 1901, Alabama made yet another offer when the Legislature appointed a commission to negotiate with Florida about annexation, but this attempt, too, was unsuccessful. The building of the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad, completed in 1883, finally linked Pensacola and the Panhandle solidly with the rest of the state and ended the region's isolation, although from time to time during the twentieth century there were still occasional calls for annexation that generated some public discussion but no legislative action. =20th century= In the last quarter of the century, hurricanes that directly struck the area and caused significant damage included Hurricane Eloise in 1975, Hurricane Kate in 1985, and Hurricane Erin and Hurricane Opal, both in 1995. The area was a prime target of the March 1993 Storm of the Century. =21st century= The Panhandle suffered direct hits from Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Dennis in 2005. Ivan was the most disastrous, making landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, with 120 mile-per-hour (193 km/h) winds and a 14-foot (4.3 m) storm surge that devastated Perdido Key and Santa Rosa Island, wrecked the Interstate 10 bridge across Escambia Bay, and destroyed thousands of homes in the region, some as far away as 20 miles (32 km) inland. On June 23, 2010, oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill landed on Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach, damaging the fishing and tourism industries, and prompting a massive clean-up effort. On October 10, 2018, the Panhandle suffered a direct hit from Hurricane Michael, with winds as high as 160 MPH. Michael was one of only four category 5 hurricanes to ever hit the US mainland. Thousands of homes were destroyed, and apartment rents in Panama City increased, with a $500 apartment renting for $1000 in 2019. Recovery from Hurricane Michael was not complete in June 2019, and disaster relief for the Panhandle remained stalled in Congress. Economy Historically, the economy of the Panhandle depended mainly on farming, forestry and lumbering, paper mills, import/export shipping at Pensacola and to a lesser extent at Panama City, shipbuilding, and commercial fishing. After World War II, the economy was boosted by the numerous military bases established in the region, as well as the growth of tourism and the hospitality industry. In addition to military bases, state and local governments, hospitals, schools, and colleges, major private employers in the second half of the twentieth century included Monsanto and Westinghouse plants at Pensacola, the St. Joe Paper Company in Port St. Joe, and Gulf Power, a major electric utility company. Unlike central and southern Florida, the Panhandle has never been a producer of citrus crops because the area is subject to regular frosts and freezes in wintertime, which destroy citrus fruits. Transportation =Road= Interstate 10 is the only interstate highway in the Panhandle, connecting the extreme west with North Florida and Jacksonville. Other older east‚Äìwest routes include U.S. Highway 90 and U.S. Highway 98. Important north‚Äìsouth routes west of the Apalachicola River include U.S. Highway 29, U.S. Highway 331, and U.S. Highway 231, all linking to Alabama and Interstate 65. State Road 20 stretches from Niceville to Tallahassee. =Rail= Freight service is provided by the Class III Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad, which acquired most of the CSX main line from Pensacola to Jacksonville on June 1, 2019. (For the history of this line, see Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad.) Passenger service ended with the creation of Amtrak in 1971, but was revived with the extension of the Sunset Limited to Orlando beginning in 1993; however, passenger service was discontinued after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. Other regional short-line railroads serving the Panhandle are the Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway (formerly BNSF Railway, ex-Frisco Railway), the Bay Line Railroad, and the AN Railway. =Air= Major airports include: * Pensacola International Airport * Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport * Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport * Tallahassee International Airport * Bob Sikes Airport * Destin Executive Airport * DeFuniak Springs Airport * Apalachicola Regional Airport * Perry-Foley Airport Education The following institutions of higher learning are located in the Florida Panhandle.

The western Panhandle, particularly the Emerald Coast, was one of the earliest areas to shake off its Yellow Dog Democrat roots, and since the 1990s has become the most Republican part of Florida. Pensacola, Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Panama City regularly give Republicans close to or over 70% margins in state and national elections. However, Tallahassee and Gadsden County tend to be strongly Democratic. In the 2008 Presidential election, John McCain received 421,287 votes (60.1%) in the Panhandle, while Barack Obama received 279,206 votes (39.9%).

According to the National Park Service: > The stunning sugar-white beaches of Gulf Islands National Seashore are > composed of fine quartz eroded from granite in the Appalachian Mountains. > The sand is carried seaward by rivers and creeks and deposited by currents > along the shore. The beach towns in the Panhandle, many of which play host to college students during spring break, are sometimes derisively called the Redneck Riviera. The term was used as the title of a song by country music artist Tom T. Hall on his 1996 album Songs from Sopchoppy. The album takes its name from a town in rural Wakulla County, near Tallahassee. Tourists have been drawn to the Panhandle since the building of the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad in the 1880s. Pensacola Beach has been a major tourist attraction since the building of bridges between the mainland and Santa Rosa Island in 1931. After World War II, an increase in both tourism and population of the area led to a proliferation of motels, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions, and amusement parks along the coast, concentrated in Pensacola Beach, Fort Walton Beach, and Panama City Beach. Examples include the Gulfarium marine park and aquarium in Fort Walton Beach, and the former Miracle Strip Amusement Park (1963‚Äì2004) in Panama City Beach. In 1971, the federal government acquired many acres of the coastal islands in Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa counties, preserving them from commercial development by establishing the Gulf Islands National Seashore, which also covers some islands off the Mississippi coast. Other beach areas protected by the state of Florida include * Perdido Key State Park * Big Lagoon State Park * Henderson Beach State Park * Grayton Beach State Park * St. Andrews State Park * St. Joseph Peninsula State Park * St. George Island State Park Both state and federal parks offer facilities for camping, picnicking, and other recreational pursuits. In addition, some parts of the coastline are federal property belonging to Pensacola Naval Air Station, Eglin Air Force Base, and Tyndall Air Force Base, and so are likewise protected from commercial development. In addition, seven state aquatic preserves, covering thousands of acres of submerged lands in coastal areas, are located in the Panhandle.\\"CAMA Office Closures,\\" Florida Department of Environmental Protection, accessed 10 July 2011 A number of other state parks, preserves, and forests are located inland. The 1970s also saw the beginnings of a number of upscale beach resorts, condominium towers, vacation homes, and planned communities, such as Seaside and Sandestin, so that most of the privately owned areas of the coastline are now heavily developed. Military bases Major military bases include the Pensacola Naval Air Station (the home of Naval Aviation in the United States), Eglin Air Force Base and Hurlburt Field near Ft. Walton Beach, Naval Support Activity Panama City in Panama City Beach, and Tyndall Air Force Base near Panama City. Smaller military bases in the Florida panhandle include the Center for Information Warfare Training in Pensacola, Naval Air Station Whiting Field near Milton and Duke Field near Crestview. The 1983-84 television show Emerald Point N.A.S. was set in a naval air station somewhere in the American South, similar to Pensacola NAS. The 1997-2000 action/adventure series Pensacola: Wings of Gold was explicitly set there.

He was also entitled to the Cross of St George, 4th Class. He is the patron of Royal Canadian Legion Branch 360 (Konowal Branch) in Toronto. First World War Konowal was born to a peasant family on 15 September 1888 in Kutkivtsi, in the Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) near the border with Austria-Hungary. At an early age, he worked as a mason alongside his father. He married Hanna (?-1932/33) in 1908. They had a daughter, Marichka. Soon after his marriage, he decided to join the Imperial Russian Army, where he served as an instructor in hand-to-hand combat. After demobilization, Konowal returned home and took up work as a feller in Siberia, before accepting a job with a Canadian company in 1913. Departing from Vladivostok, Konowal crossed the Pacific Ocean to Vancouver, British Columbia, and continued working as a feller, gradually making his way east. By the beginning of 1914, Konowal had lost his job as a feller and ended up working a series of odd jobs until the outbreak of World War I. On 12 July 1915, Konowal enlisted in the 77th Canadian Infantry Battalion, and on 19 June 1916, left Halifax for Liverpool. After arriving in England, Konowal was promoted to acting corporal and was transferred to the 47th (British Columbia) Battalion of the 4th Canadian Division. In August 1916, the 4th Division arrived in France, and took part in the assault on Vimy Ridge in April 1917. From 22‚Äì24 August 1917, during the Battle of Hill 70 in Lens, France, he was recognized for conspicuous gallantry in the face of the enemy and awarded the Victoria Cross.Stewart, Charles H.: Overseas ‚Äì The Linages and Insignia of the Canadian Expeditionary Force 1914‚Äì1919, page 25. Little & Stewart Publishing, 1970. Konowal's medal was personally presented by King George V, and he was promoted to sergeant. =Victoria Cross citation= The citation was published in a supplement to the London Gazette of 23 November 1917 (dated 26 November 1917): > No. 144039 A./Cpl.

Post-war  On 19 July 1919, Konowal accompanied Leontiy Diedek, a friend and fellow veteran, to a particularly rough area in Hull, Quebec. The two men went for dinner at a restaurant; Diedek left early in order to look at some bicycles at the home of William Artich, an 'Austrian' bootlegger and bicycle salesman. Konowal became aware of a commotion and went to investigate. A fight had started between Artich and Diedek. By the time Konowal arrived, Diedek had been viciously beaten and Artich was armed with a knife. Konowal managed to gain control over the weapon and killed Artich with a single stab to the chest. Konowal did not attempt to flee the scene; when police came, the First World War veteran stated, \\"I've killed fifty-two of them, that makes the fifty-third.\\" Veterans rallied to his cause and raised enough money to bail Konowal in October 1919; the trial ended up being postponed three times, finally beginning in 1921. After extensive tests, it was discovered that Konowal was suffering from serious medical problems stemming from his war wounds: pressure on his brain was increasing and his condition was continually deteriorating. Medical experts unanimously agreed that a wartime gunshot wound to the head was likely making Konowal mentally unstable, causing flashbacks to the war's battles. The jury agreed and he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, then institutionalized for seven years. By the end of this period, his condition had improved dramatically, and he was released from a Montreal mental hospital in 1928. He eventually found employment as a caretaker at the House of Commons in Ottawa, with the help of a military associate. When Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King saw the colours of a Victoria Cross ribbon on Konowal while he was at work, King arranged for him to be reassigned to a lifetime job in King's personal office. Unfortunately, tragedy struck once again when Konowal attempted to contact his family: his wife had died during the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933 (the Holodomor) and his daughter was nowhere to be found, though it was later reported she survived and left descendants.Ottawa Citizen, 21 July 1919, p. 5. Konowal married a French- Canadian woman, Juliette Leduc-Auger (1901‚Äì1987), in 1934 and adopted her two sons, Roland and Albert. In 1956, he joined 300 other Victoria Cross recipients in London for events celebrating the honour's centennial, hosted by then British Prime Minister Anthony Eden and Queen Elizabeth II. Konowal died in 1959 at Hull, Quebec, aged 70. He was buried at Notre Dame de Lourdes Cemetery, Ottawa, under a headstone in section A, lot 502.

From the left: the Victoria Cross, British War Medal, Victory Medal, George VI Coronation Medal, Elizabeth II Coronation Medal The Canadian War Museum in Ottawa purchased Konowal's Victoria Cross and other medals in 1969. The decoration went missing sometime in the 1970s, apparently stolen, and was sold to an antique shop along with some Hawaiian coins in the mid-1990s. The shop owner believed the decoration was a fake, as it was inscribed with \\"For Valour\\" ‚Äì evidently not realizing that all VCs awarded to Canadians had the English motto. (The source of confusion was the fact that a new Canadian VC was introduced into the Canadian Honours System in 1993, bearing the Latin motto Pro Valore). The decoration was rediscovered when the shop owner offered it to the Jeffrey Hoare Auction House in London, Ontario in April 2004. A British collector discovered the auction and notified Lubomyr Luciuk, co-author of a booklet about Konowal, who took steps to have the decoration secured.Lubomyr Luciuk, \\"The prodigal medal returns\\", in Ukrainian Weekly.

She was formerly affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI) until 2005, when she left and founded the New Alliance Party (Partido Nueva Alianza, or PANAL), which is currently led by Luis Castro Obreg√≥n. Gordillo was arrested by the Mexican authorities on 26 February 2013 on charges of embezzlement and organized crime. She was included in a list of the \\"10 most corrupt Mexicans\\" published by Forbes in 2013. Gordillo has held considerable influence over governments and individual presidents by persuading her union members to vote as a single bloc. Early life Elba Esther Gordillo was born on 6 February 1945, in Comit√°n, Chiapas. Career Gordillo joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1970, at the height of its \\"dirty war\\". She has occupied several PRI positions including Secretary of Organization of the National Executive Council (1986‚Äì1987), General Secretary of the Council of National Popular Organizations (1997‚Äì2002), and General Secretary of the National Executive Council, the second highest position within the party. Gordillo then became one of the most powerful women in Mexican politics. She was the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1987. She was the head of the PRI faction in the Chamber of Deputies, but after a political war with Roberto Madrazo, she lost that position when a slim majority of 118 PRI deputies voted to oust Gordillo as head of their 224-seat faction in the lower house. Gordillo was forced out of the congress leadership presumably because her political ambitions clashed with those of Madrazo regarding the presidential elections of 2006. Heightened political pressure and illness pushed Gordillo out from public life for about a year, though she did hold on to her post as the PRI secretary general. In early 2005 Gordillo returned to public life and Roberto Madrazo greeted her with open arms. According to PRI rules, Gordillo, as secretary general of the party, should have replaced Madrazo when he stepped down; but, in a surprise move, Mariano Palacios Alcocer took Madrazo's position instead of Gordillo, who publicly broke with Madrazo just few days before Palacios Alcocer's election. Gordillo accused Madrazo of trying to bribe her with the party's presidency in exchange for supporting his candidacy; she also said that Madrazo had no respect for democracy and just wanted to assure himself of the nomination and was breaking party rules to impose a party leader of his own choosing. The day that Mariano Palacios Alcocer was elected, Gordillo filed a complaint with a federal electoral tribunal asking for protection of her political rights, but the tribunal ruled against her. On 19 September and as a result of the dispute with Madrazo, Gordillo resigned her Secretary General position in the PRI but decided to continue her affiliation with the party. On 13 July 2006, two weeks after the federal elections, the PRI announced her expulsion from its ranks for having supported the National Action Party and for attacking and slandering the PRI's leaders and candidates. =Corruption= Gordillo holds significant powers from the national public schools system dominated by Gordillo's union in which teaching positions could be sold or inherited. There are roughly 1.5 million teachers in this union which she has controlled since 1989. In 2008, she was reportedly caught on camera having bought 59 new Hummer vehicles to give her aides, only to raffle them off when the media brought the purchase to light. Gordillo is notorious for wearing luxury brands such as Herm√®s and Chanel. She has allegedly spent US$2.1 million at a Neiman Marcus department store in San Diego between March 2009 and January 2012. Gordillo allegedly used the money on properties, including in the US, a private jet, art work and plastic surgeries. She has allegedly amassed some 10 properties, including a US$1.7 million home in San Diego and a $4 million water-front house in Coronado, California.Las casas de Gordillo en Coronado, California Gordillo allegedly set up a political party that followed principles of a patronage system in 2005 that became notorious for obtaining privileges and appointments in return of its support in key elections. It was widely speculated that she helped former president Felipe Calderon obtain his narrow victory for the presidency in 2006 as part of a deal that allowed her to place individuals in the government who held allegiances to her. The former union leader was formally charged in February 2013 with embezzling US$200 million from the union to fund her lavish lifestyle. She is notorious for her expensive Herm√®s bags as well as numerous plastic surgeries from clinics in California. She is believed to own or be connected to three residences in California. One of these, where she spent most of her time before her arrest, was a $4.7 million house in Coronado Cays with a private dock, a boat, and Jet Ski. Gordillo was arrested on corruption charges by the Mexican authorities on 26 February 2013 after her private jet in which she had travelled from California landed at the Toluca airport near the capital. She was arrested for allegedly embezzling 2 billion pesos (US$156,816,000 or ‚Ç¨119,242,600) from the Mexican National Educational Workers Union (SNTE), according to Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam. She also allegedly wired large sums of money to Swiss bank accounts, while other funds were used for plastic surgeries or personal luxuries. Among other questionable expenditures, according to Karam, were the maintenance and rental expenses of a hangar and aircraft. Prosecutors argue she would not have been able to make several purchases on her salary.Mexico union replaces Elba Esther Gordillo (28 February 2013) (31,398 pesos or US$2,459 per month.) She has been charged with embezzlement and organized crime. To head her criminal defense, Gordillo hired prominent penal lawyer Marco Antonio del Toro Carazo who is also defending labor leader Napole√≥n G√≥mez Urrutia.

The capital of the province is the city of Erzurum. It is bordered by the provinces of Kars and Aƒürƒ± to the east, Mu≈ü and Bing√∂l to the south, Erzincan and Bayburt to the west, Rize and Artvin to the north and Ardahan to the northeast. Okay Memi≈ü was appointed as the governor of the province by a presidential decree on 27 October 2018. Geography The surface area of the province of Erzurum is the fourth biggest in Turkey. The majority of the province is elevated. Most plateaus are about above sea level, and the mountainous regions beyond the plateaus are and higher. Depression plains are located between the mountains and plateaus. The southern mountain ranges include the Paland√∂ken Mountains (highest peak B√ºy√ºk Ejder high) and the ≈ûahveled Mountains (highest peak √áakmak Mountain high). The northern mountain ranges are the second row elevations of the North Anatolian Mountains, i.e. Mescit Mountains (highest peak high), Kargapazarƒ± Mountains (highest peak high) and Allahuekber Mountains. The two depression plains between these mountainous areas are Erzurum Plains and Hasankale Plains. Continental climate rules in the province with long and harsh winters, and short and mild summers. The average low temperature is , while the average high temperature is . Average annual precipitation is . Snow falls on an average of 80 days and remains for about 150 days. Steppe formations are prevalent geographic features of this province, occupying about 60% of the surface area, much of it fertile. Forested areas are small, mainly consisting of scots pines and oaks. The eastern part of the province lies in the basin of the Aras river, the western part in the Karasu (Euphrates) basin, and the northern part in the √áoruh basin. There are few natural lakes in the province, the major one being Lake Tortum (approximately 8 km¬≤) fed by the Tortum (Uzundere) Falls.

It became an important border fortress. This city was later (A.D. 415) renamed to Theodosiopolis (), in honour of Emperor Theodosius I. Standing on the crossroads of main trade routes in Asia Minor, the area was a centre of importance for Greeks, amongst whom also lived a population of Armenians, Syriac Christians, Jews and Assyrians. From the mid 3rd century AD and afterwards, the territory was dominated by and incorporated into the Sasanian Empire, although it occasionally briefly fell under the rule of the neighboring Byzantine Empire as well. From the mid 7th century AD, the Arabs frequently clashed with the Byzantine Empire, including over the region Between the seventh and eight centuries Arabs and Byzantines alternately held the region in their power, local Armenian rulers played a significant role in these events. The city (present day Erzurum) was alternatively held by the Arabs and Byzantines during the 7-10th centuries it was also part of the Georgian kingdom of Tao-Klarjeti in the 10th century. Threatened and later devastated and looted by the Seljuk Turks in 1049, the old city of Erzen was conquered, but Theodosiopolis survived the invasion until it was captured some time later. From the year 1101 onward it is documented that the ruling dynasty of the Saltukids held the town and much of the surrounding area in their power. Theodosiopolis repelled many attacks and military campaigns by the Seljuks of Rum and Georgians (the latter knew the city as Karnu-KalakiRapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies in Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, p. 414. Peeters Publishers, ) until 1201 when the city and province were conquered by the Seljuk sultan S√ºleiman II of R√ºm. Erzen- Erzurum fell to the Mongol siege in 1242, and the city was looted and devastated. After the fall of the Seljuk Sultanate of Anatolia (R√ºm) in the early 14th century, it became an administrative province of the Ilkhanates, and after their fall, became part of the √áoban beylik, Black Sheep Turkmen, Mongols led by Timur Lenk, the White Sheep Turkmen and the rising Iranian Safavids captured the town in 1502 from the Aq Qoyunlu. = In the Ottoman Empire = In 1514, the region was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I following the Battle of Chaldiran. During the Ottoman reign, the city Erzurum served as the main base of Ottoman military power in the region and as the capital of the province. Early in the 17th century, the province was threatened again and taken by Safavid Iran while enduring also a revolt by the province governor Abaza Mehmed Pasha. This revolt was combined with Jelali Revolts (the uprising of the provincial musketeers called the Celali), backed by Safavid Iran and lasted until 1628. However, Iran would reconquered it again, only this time under Nader Shah in the first half of the 18th century. The capture of Erzurum by Ivan Paskevich on 27 June 1829 The Ottomans were routed by the Iranian Qajars in the 1821 battle at the city of Erzurum.George Childs Kohn. Dictionary of Wars Routledge, 31 okt. 2013 p 506 The city was conquered by the Russian army in 1829, given back to the Ottoman Empire with the Treaty of Adrianople (Edirne). The poet Alexander Pushkin accompanied the Russian commander-in-chief, Ivan Paskevich, during that expedition and penned a brief account of the campaign. The city was again assaulted by the Russian army in the last Russo-Turkish War in 1877. From the 1 December 1914 onwards, extermination campaigns against the Armenians were executed in Erzurum by Ottomans which resulted in the Armenian Genocide. The province was the site of the major fighting during Caucasus Campaign of World War I between Russian and Ottoman forces including the key confrontation of the campaign, Battle of Erzurum which resulted in capture of Erzurum by Russian army under the command of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich on 16 February 1916. It was returned to the Ottomans with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918. Erzurum was also a main Turkish base during the Turkish War of Independence and the Erzurum congress of Turkish nationalists was held here in 1919. It was declared a province of Turkey in 1924. = In Turkey = In September 1935 the third Inspectorate General (Umumi M√ºfetti≈ülik, UM) was created. The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars G√ºm√º≈ühane, Erzincan and Aƒürƒ±. Its capital was to be in the city of Erzurum and it was governed by a Inspector General. The Inspectorate General was dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party. Economy Historically, Erzurum produced wheat and linseed; as of 1920, annual production of linseed grossed between 1,000 and 1,500 tons. Honey was also produced for local use. Approximately 18.5% of the total surface area is arable land, of which about 75% has permanent crops. A large portion of the agricultural produce comprises cereals. Forested areas occupy 8.8% of the total surface area, with forestry a local industry. Industries largely consist of manufacturing of forestry, agriculture, husbandry, chemistry, textile and mining products. There are 81 active industrial plants in the province, most of them located at the central district of Erzurum, and are small and medium enterprises. Due to their relatively small sizes, these industries mainly serve local markets causing lower capacity usage, low productivity and unemployment. About 40 plants are currently out of use, mostly due to high operating costs. The province of Erzurum has the highest ratio of meadows and pastures in Turkey, ideal for livestock. However, once the main occupation, animal husbandry lost its importance in the 1980s with the introduction of a liberal economy and the importation of animal products. A large organized industrial park concentrating on processing meat is being built with the hope of reviving this sector. Food industries include beekeeping and trout farming. Mining resources include lead, copper, chromium, and zinc, the reserves of which are almost exhausted. There is a considerable amount of lignite, however because its ash and sulfur ratios are high, it suitable only for industrial use. Magnesite, fire clay, gypsum, manganese, diatomite, marble, rock salt and perlite are also present. The few natural geothermal resources, except one, are not suitable for economic investments, and they are used as natural springs. The gross domestic product GDP of Erzurum is USD 1.16 billion, constituting less than 1% of the total and ranking 40th among Turkish provinces (1997 values). Transportation is possible via paved and unpaved highways. The Erzurum international airport is open for commercial flights and is also used by the Turkish Air Force. The runways of this airport are the second longest in Turkey. Erzurum is also the main railroad hub in the Eastern Anatolia Region. The largest contributor to the provincial economy, in recent years, has been Atat√ºrk University, which is also one of the largest universities in Turkey, having more than forty thousand students. Tourist activities, which include skiing, rafting, and mountaineering, also provide a substantial proportion of the province's income. Skiing is centered on Paland√∂ken Mountain. Notable Personalities Nene Hatun Turkish folk heroine, who became known for fighting against Russian forces during the recapture of Fort Aziziye in Erzurum from Russian forces at the start of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878 was from Erzurum.

It is part of the University of Massachusetts (UMass) system. It is home to three schools: the School of Medicine, the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and the Graduate School of Nursing, as well as a biomedical research enterprise and a range of public-service initiatives throughout the state. History UMMS was established by an act of the Massachusetts Legislature in 1962 to provide residents of the commonwealth an opportunity to study medicine at an affordable cost and to increase the number of primary-care physicians practicing in the commonwealth's under-served areas. The School of Medicine accepted its first class of 16 students in 1970. Six years later a 371-bed hospital opened on campus; the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences opened in 1979, and the Graduate School of Nursing opened in 1986. In 1998 the UMMS system of hospitals and clinics merged with Memorial Health Care to form UMass Memorial Health Care, the largest health-care provider in Central Massachusetts and clinical partner of UMMS. =Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research= The research mission at UMMS was augmented in 1997 with the acquisition of the financially ailing Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research, the Shrewsbury, Massachusetts institution where researchers developed the combined oral contraceptive pill during the early 1960s. Academics =School of Medicine= Accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the School of Medicine grants the MD degree to its graduates. With the exception of MD/PhD students, degree candidates were formerly required to be Massachusetts residents, a policy which has changed beginning with the entering class of 2016. Approximately 165 students enroll annually, and more than 4,350 students have received medical degrees from UMMS. The School of Medicine has gained a national reputation for its primary- care program and consistently ranks in the top 10 percent of schools in the annual U.S.News & World Report guide, \\"America‚Äôs Best Graduate Schools\\". SCImago Journal Rank listed the university at No. 74 in the US and No. 248 globally. Over half of each graduating class enters primary-care residencies, a trend underscoring the school's founding mission, though that figure has decreased in recent years. In addition, a high number of graduates practice throughout the state. The institution attributes its success in training primary-care physicians, in part, to a curriculum which emphasizes early exposure to community practice (beginning in the first year of medical school). Third-year students are required to complete a clerkship-rotation program, in which they spend six weeks at a time with community-based physicians. The curriculum's learning objectives are targeted at developing the foundational competencies required of all physicians including competency in communication, scientific, and patient- and community-advocacy skills. In 2010, National Resident Matching Program results showed that members of the UMMS class were accepted into some of the most competitive residency programs in the country; 71 percent of graduates entered primary care (including obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine and pediatrics). =Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences= The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) is a PhD-granting program that trains scientists in a specialty area with a broad background in the basic medical sciences in preparation for conducting research with direct relevance to human disease. According to the GSBS website, the school offers students a multidisciplinary program of study, in which they have freedom of choice in curriculum and in the selection of mentors for their graduate-thesis research. Since the first class of seven students enrolled in 1979, more than 300 students have earned PhDs from the GSBS. =Graduate School of Nursing= Since the opening of the Graduate School of Nursing (GSN) in 1986, more than 600 students have obtained a nursing master's, post-master's or doctoral degree from the school. The GSN prepares professional and advanced practice nurses, nurse scientists and educators as leaders in nursing and health-care delivery to diverse populations through education, research, practice and service (according to the GSN website). Research UMMS researchers have made advances in a broad range of disease families, from HIV and infectious diseases to cancer, genetic disorders, diabetes and immune disease. UMMS faculty discovered the link between the immune system and type-1 diabetes, found the genetic cause underlying the third-most-common form of the muscular dystrophies, established the fundamental difference between HIV and other retroviruses. In the 1990s. UMMS Professor of Medicine Shan Lu, leader of the UMMS DNA based flu vaccine efforts worked to advance the development of a potential avian-flu vaccine. Lu's team has also been recognized for its work in the creation of an HIV vaccine, which in Phase I testing was found to generate antibody and T-cell responses in otherwise-healthy people not infected with HIV. In 1998, UMMS researcher Craig Mello (an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute) and his colleague Andrew Fire (of Stanford University, then of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.) discovered RNA interference (RNAi). They demonstrated that small pieces of double-stranded RNA had interfered with the expression of a gene whose coding sequence of DNA was similar to that of the RNA they tested. Mello and Fire received the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries related to RNA interference. Federal and private research grants and contracts at UMMS rose from about $2 million in 1977 to more than $250 million in 2019. UMMS currently supports more than 260 investigators working on advancements in the treatment of disease and injury. UMass was ranked 21st in the nation in generating income from the licensing by AUTM, and generated $35.0 million in technology-transfer income in 2018. The school's portfolio of commercial ventures and intellectual property was catapulted by the success of UMMS licenses and patents (including intellectual property related to RNAi gene-silencing technology and drug and vaccine development). =MassBiologics= MassBiologics is the only publicly owned, non-profit FDA-licensed manufacturer of vaccine and other biologic products in the United States. First established in 1894, the University of Massachusetts Biologic Laboratory was re-established in 1997 by the Massachusetts legislature, and oversight was transferred from the Department of Public Health to UMMS. In recent years, MassBiologics has been called upon to respond to the threat of SARS, avian flu and rabies. MassBiologics has developed or collaborated on five ‚Äúorphan products‚Äù over the past twenty years. MassBiologics continues to market its FDA-licensed Td (tetanus and diphtheria) vaccine, providing a substantial proportion of the U.S. requirement for this vaccine. MassBiologics participates in the discovery, production and clinical testing of monoclonal antibodies (including antibodies to Clostridium difficile), antibodies now known as actoxumab and bezlotoxumab In 2005, the firm opened an $80-million facility for monoclonal-antibody production. Co-developed with Serum Institute of India, it invented a fast acting anti-Rabies drug called Rabies Human Monoclonal Antibody (RMAb). UMMS is extending its mission of public service through its Commonwealth Medicine initiative. Faculty Notable faculty members include: * Victor Ambros, discovered the first microRNA. * Job Dekker, developer of the Chromosome conformation capture method. * Katherine A. Fitzgerald, molecular biologist and virologist, finalist for the 2011 Vilcek Prize * Craig C.

Affiliates and clinical partners The hospital and clinical components of UMMS are part of UMass Memorial Health Care (UMMHC). UMass Memorial is a multibillion-dollar health-care system consisting of acute-care hospitals, ambulatory clinics and a network of primary care physicians and specialists throughout central Massachusetts. With approximately 13,000 employees (including 1,500 physicians), UMMHC is the largest health-care provider in central and western Massachusetts. Its flagship hospital (UMass Memorial Medical Center) straddles two campuses along Route 9 in Worcester, Massachusetts and is designated by the American College of Surgeons as a Level I Trauma Center. Its largest publicly funded affiliate in the field of cancer research is the Quality Assurance Review Center (QARC), located in Lincoln, Rhode Island. Supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), QARC receives radiotherapy data from around 1,000 hospitals in the United States. UMMHC also maintains four community hospitals: *Clinton Hospital in Clinton *HealthAlliance Hospital in Fitchburg and Leominster *Marlborough Hospital in Marlborough *Wing Memorial Hospital in Palmer Campus Albert Sherman Center =Albert Sherman Center= The University of Massachusetts Medical School enters a new era of biomedical research, medical education and campus collaboration with the opening of the $400 million Albert Sherman Center.

Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film Clockwork, deciding to produce a proof of concept horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his friends Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss as the two protagonists and produced the film for $1,600. Shot on location in a remote cabin in the woods, production was a difficult process because of the low budget. Several of the special effects presented in the film were done in a severely low budget manner, some of which were improvised on set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods. Raimi convinced a local theater manager to screen the film alongside The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which sparked minor interest. Initially a meager success, the film screened well to test audiences and inspired a larger budget remake directed by Raimi, called The Evil Dead (1981). The film was the first in the Evil Dead franchise, and launched the careers of both Campbell and Raimi. Several of the aesthetic qualities found in Within the Woods later defined Raimi's films. Plot Two romantic couples, consisting of four teenagers, decide to spend a weekend together located in a remote cabin found in the woods. An unseen force stalks and watches the group without their knowledge. Ellen and her boyfriend Bruce enter the woods to have a picnic lunch. The other couple, Scotty and Shelly, remain at the cabin playing Monopoly to pass time. During their lunch, Bruce announces to Ellen that they're camping on an Indian burial ground. Ellen is concerned, but Bruce assures her that they will be fine as long as they don't disturb the graves of the dead. Bruce then explores the area and discovers an ancient dagger belonging to the Indians. Ignoring his own advice, he takes the dagger with him. After lunch, Ellen takes a nap. When she awakes, she finds Bruce missing and wanders into the woods looking for him. To her horror, she finds Bruce's dead body, horribly mutilated with apparent knife wounds. She is then startled by the presence of a demonic entity hiding within the woods, and quickly runs back to the cabin. While fleeing, she is attacked by unseen forces. She runs back to the cabin and screams to be let in immediately, being let in just as the entity is approaching her. Ellen tells her friends that Bruce has been murdered, but Scotty dismisses the whole thing as a joke and goes to find Bruce. Shelly and Ellen are concerned when Scotty doesn't return right away. Shelly walks outside to begin a search for the missing men, but a possessed Bruce assaults and strangles her, eventually stabbing her in the neck and killing her with the dagger that he found, moaning \\"join us.\\" Ellen encounters her possessed friend and flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts to enter the room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand several times in the process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking down the stairs to the cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand. Ellen attempts to flee but is severely beaten by the possessed Bruce, who throws her around the cabin. While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruce's mutilated hand which is still holding the dagger found from before, and she uses it to stab Bruce. A large amount of blood is expended by Bruce, who lies motionless for a moment, only to then continue his assault on Ellen. Ellen mutilates Bruce's body even further with an axe, chopping off nearly every limb from the writhing body. Severely disturbed by the things she has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth muttering to herself. The corpse of Scotty suddenly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving the fate of Ellen ambiguous. Cast *Bruce Campbell as Bruce *Ellen Sandweiss as Ellen *Scott Spiegel as Scotty *Mary Valenti as Shelly Production =Background= right Before the development stages of Within the Woods, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were long time friends who had grown up together. The duo had produced several low- budget films with super 8 mm film during their youth. During the early parts of Raimi's career, he directed films that were mostly classified as comedies, such as Booby Bartenders, Shemp Eats the Moon and The Great Bogus Monkey Pignut Swindle. While those films were described as \\"goofy\\" and primitive by members of the cast and crew, Raimi eventually produced the short film It's Murder!, which featured mostly comedic moments. One of the sequences of the film involved a suspenseful moment where a criminal jumped on an unsuspecting individual. Raimi later dismissed the short film, but complimented that scene, stating that it was \\"the only part of It's Murder! that really worked well. While working on the film, it inspired Raimi to approach the horror genre with more enthusiasm, leading to the conception of his next short film Clockwork. The film featured a woman being stalked by a demented man, and launched an interest in Raimi to pursue working on more horror films. While both Raimi and Campbell expressed a positive opinion on the genre, they admitted they had little experience with the genre and went to drive-in theaters to research various science fiction and horror films. Raimi developed the motto \\"the gore the merrier\\" during these sessions at the drive-in, and quickly developed an interest in films featuring high levels of blood. Raimi gained an appeal in B movie cinema, which led him to want to pursue the production of a more ambitious film for his next project. In order to gain the interest of producers, Raimi and Campbell set out to produce a \\"prototype\\" film that would serve as a showcase of their talents. The film would work as a trailer to help promote further cinematic productions. The prototype film was called Within the Woods. In addition to Raimi's interest in various horror films, one of the main inspirations came in the writing of H. P. Lovecraft, who introduced the concept of the \\"book of the dead\\" to Raimi. Raimi studied the concept of magical books, in particular the Necronomicon, which formed the basis of the film. Campbell described the film as a combination of \\"creative writing and ancient history\\". In order to flesh out of the idea, Raimi came up with a concept where a group of teenagers went into the woods and were attacked by demonic spirits, summoned by the disturbance of an Indian burial ground. The book of the dead concept was not present in the finished film, but appeared extensively in later films by Raimi. =Filming= left Raimi was able to secure $1600 to produce the film. Raimi and Campbell collected a group of their friends and family who were interested in participating in the production of the film. The film was primarily shot at a farm house belonging to one of Raimi's friends located in Marshall, Michigan. One of the regular actors involved with Raimi's early short films, Ellen Sandweiss, was cast as the film's protagonist. This decision stemmed from the notion that most horror films at the time involved female leads, who were more enjoyable to watch terrorized. The current boyfriend of Sandweiss was cast as the film's antagonist, a demon who threatens the cast. Campbell was cast as one of the protagonists, though he initially was not familiar with horror cinema and instead identified as a fan of comedies. One of the films that inspired Campbell's interest in the genre was John Carpenter's film Halloween. Another Raimi regular, Scott Spiegel, was also cast as a protagonist based on his prior collaborations with the group. The effects of the film were entirely low-budget. Nearly every effect in the film was done via things picked up at a make-up and Halloween store located close to where the film was shot. The effects in the film were notably more intricate than the simple ones featured in Raimi's prior projects, and contained mutilated bodies, stabbed body parts and demonic possession skin-attachments. Tom Sullivan was one of the primary make-up supervisors on set, and he found it difficult working presentable effects out of such low budgets. One notable example involved a chest stabbing rig that had to be attached to Spiegel's chest by straps and duct tape. Campbell had to sleep wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that required to be shot in both the day and the night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually \\"changed shape\\" because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film- makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with \\"bizarre\\" ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, \\"taking it a little further than we had gone before, recording synch- sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect. =Post-production= right Though production was difficult for many of the actors involved, especially Campbell, the film was eventually completed within acceptable budget limits. Raimi had completed the filming of his \\"prototype\\" and sought out to develop and edit the film as cheaply as possible. Though at the time it was unknown how the film was going to be distributed. Raimi had shot the film in the same style as many of his earlier films, with 8mm film. He intended to blow the footage up after filming to the industry standard of 35mm in order to save money, though Campbell noted that the idea was without precedent. Though the request was \\"obscure\\" in nature, a company in San Francisco managed to accommodate the task with little difficulty. Upon testing how the footage looked at a local movie theater, it came out mostly acceptable, until further tests led to the footage appearing grainy and difficult to make out. Distribution and reception After production, Raimi virtually had no idea how the film was going to be distributed and what would come of it. The main idea behind shooting the film was to make a trailer to show to future investors, but even that was proving to be difficult. Eventually, Raimi got in contact with a manager at a movie theater in Detroit who was \\"open and flexible\\". The same theater played The Rocky Horror Picture Show every single week and was open to more unusual cinema. To Raimi's shock, the manager agreed to screen Within the Woods right before a midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The premiere of the film received a positive reception by the audience, and the cast and crew was paid just over $10, all of which was donated to the American Cancer Society. The film, however, was never commercially released. While critics mostly ignored the locally distributed, low-budget horror film, local The Detroit News critic Michael McWilliams watched the premiere of the film, writing that \\"it will probably never be advertised alongside the glossy, big-budget horror movies of our time, but you won't easily forget a locally produced little film called Within the Woods\\". He compared the low-budget film to the blockbuster The Amityville Horror, writing that it provided more scares. Tom Sulivan, the make-up supervisor of the film, stated that the film \\"really packs a punch\\", and expressed a positive opinion of working on the project. Aftermath right In order to produce a follow-up picture, Raimi needed nearly $150,000. Raimi approached Phil Gillis, a lawyer to one of his friends, asking if he wanted to invest money into the production of a remake. Gillis was unimpressed with Within the Woods, but offered Raimi legal advice on how to approach further productions. Raimi approached several investors, \\"begging\\" for money, and eventually acquired nearly $90,000 of the funds needed and set out to make the movie anyway. Within the Woods was later retooled by Raimi with a vastly higher production value and a full-length running time as the 1981 film The Evil Dead. The Evil Dead would go on to be the first installment of a film franchise spawning two sequels, Evil Dead II (1987), and Army of Darkness (1992), both of which were directed by Raimi and featured Campbell as Ash Williams. A remake/sequel, known as Evil Dead, was released in 2013 with Raimi and Campbell as producers and creative consultants. In 2015, the Starz television network began airing the ongoing comedy horror series Ash vs Evil Dead, which features Bruce Campbell returning as an older Ash Williams. Several aspects of Within the Woods were later presented in future Raimi films, including the use of the \\"Raimi-cam\\", a camera rig that creates a fluent flow of camera movement. Other elements, such as graphic imagery, bleak endings, and mutilations, defined many of Raimi's other films. Campbell made cameo appearances in all three of Raimi's Spider-Man films, as well as several other films for Raimi. Academy Award winning film-making duo the Coen brothers were inspired by Raimi's decision to produce a short film as a trailer, utilizing the concept to produce funding for their debut Blood Simple (1984). The Coen brothers served as editors for The Evil Dead, and developed a friendship with Raimi. The duo has cast Campbell in some of their films such as The Hudsucker Proxy (1994) and Fargo (1996), the former of which was co- written by Raimi.

The village is some east of Hajn√≥wka and southeast of the province capital, Bia≈Çystok. Location Bia≈Çowie≈ºa is in northeast Poland, in Podlasie Province, near Poland's border with Belarus. The nearest city is Bia≈Çystok, the province capital. Bia≈Çowie≈ºa is also connected to the town of Hajn√≥wka, some away. The Narewka River flows through Bia≈Çowie≈ºa. Bia≈Çowie≈ºa is the seat of the administrative district of Gmina Bia≈Çowie≈ºa, which encompasses an area of and has a population of 3068 (2000). Other villages in the district are Budy, Gr√≥dek, Pogorzelce, and Teremiski. History Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Hill, 1820 St. Nicholas' Orthodox church, in Bia≈Çowie≈ºa ::For a more detailed history of Bia≈Çowie≈ºa and the area see: Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest Before 1426, a wooden hunting lodge was built for King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço on the ≈Åutownia River, in the middle of the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest. The lodge was probably one of the area's first permanent settlements, though the forest had already been penetrated by hunters from nearby areas and by the King himself, who hunted there. The wooden lodge was painted white and became the namesake for both the future village and the forest (Bia≈Çowie≈ºa means White Tower in Polish). Hunting lodge, Bia≈Çowie≈ºa's oldest surviving building From 1538 the forest was protected by the laws of King Sigismund I the Old. However, until the times of John Casimir the forest was mostly unpopulated. Sporadic settlements were established in various places, but the manor in Bia≈Çowie≈ºa was the only one to be permanent. In the late 17th century, several small villages were started for development of local iron ore deposits and tar production. The villages were populated with settlers from Masovia and Podlaskie and many of them still exist. At the end of the 16th century, probably around 1594, the royal court was moved to the area of today's Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Glade. According to the inventory from 1696, Bia≈Çowie≈ºa was a 25-morgic farm in the period in question. In 1710 Bia≈Çowie≈ºa was affected by a plague epidemic. The settlement and the royal hunting court were burnt down, and the residents who avoided infection moved to a new place. About the burned village is reminiscent of a wooden Orthodox cross set up by the Browska Road, which according to one version means the place where the wooden Orthodox church was located, according to the other - the place where the village once ended. In the mid-eighteenth century, August III built a new hunting palace in the area of today's Palace Park, whose first description comes from an inventory from 1773. On September 27, 1752, August III organized a great hunt in the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest. To commemorate this event, a sandstone obelisk was erected near the palace, in which the names of the hunting entourage and the number of slaughtered animals were engraved in Polish and German. In the years 1765-1780 Bia≈Çowie≈ºa was ruled by the Lithuanian court Treasurer Antoni Tyzenhauz. In 1784 King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski came to Bia≈Çowie≈ºa. There were the last royal hunts in the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest.Historia miejscowo≈õci After the Partitions of Poland the local population was turned into serfs and Bia≈Çowie≈ºa quickly depopulated. Tsar Alexander I reintroduced the reserve in 1801 and hired a small amount of peasants for protection of the animals. Most of them were settled in the administrative centre of the area - Bia≈Çowie≈ºa. However, since most of the foresters took part in the November Uprising (500 out of 502 in total), their posts were abolished and protection was again harmed. Yet again the village of Bia≈Çowie≈ºa ceased to exist. Protection was reintroduced in 1860 and the village was repopulated with Russians. The rapid development of Bia≈Çowie≈ºa took place after 1888, when the settlement was incorporated into tsarist estates. In the years 1889-1894 a large hunting palace was built, designed by Nicholas de Rochefort. A number of buildings were built in the vicinity of the palace: The ≈öwicki (Hunting House) with comfortable, separate rooms, a common billiard room, baths for the tsar's dawn (burned down in 1962), the Hofmarsza≈Çkowski House for court marshals (built in 1904), kitchen buildings, palace stable for 40 horses, laundry, telephone station, power plant (demolished in 1978), electric mill, house for servicing horses, house of the palace supervisor, house of shooters (built in 1904), woodcutter, cold store, bakery, house for preparation of forest animals, etc. As a result, a large housing estate was created. In 1895, an English-style palace park was created with an area of approximately 50 ha, designed by Walerian Kronenberg. At that time, another park with an area of 20 ha was established in another part of Bia≈Çowie≈ºa, also according to the design of Kronenberg, surrounding the seat of the Board of the Appanaged Forest. Originally called a regiment, in the interwar period it received the name of the Directorate Park, which is preserved until today. 7 clerical houses were built in this area. In 1895, construction was completed and a new stone church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, located near the palace.Historia miejscowo≈õci During World War I most of the local Eastern Orthodox (ethnic Belarusian) population fled before the advancing German army which seized the area in August 1915. The Germans built a lumber mill in Bia≈Çowie≈ºa, connected to the nearby town of Hajn√≥wka by a railway. However, the village did not recover until 1921 when the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park was established. The village became the administrative center of the Park and one of the most popular tourist attractions of the area. Following the Polish-Soviet War, Bia≈Çowie≈ºa was returned to Poland. On September 1, 1939 with the onset of World War II and joint German and Soviet attack on Poland, Luftwaffe bombed Bialowieza. The bombs seriously damaged the church and, to a lesser extent, a military field hospital located in one of the wings of the palace. Then Bia≈Çowie≈ºa was taken over by the German 3rd Armored Division. On September 16, Podlasie Cavalry Brigade entered Bia≈Çowie≈ºa. On September 20, general Zygmunt Podhorski pseud. \\"Zaza\\" appointed from the gathered units of the Suwalska Cavalry Brigade and the Podlaska Cavalry Brigade the improvised Cavalry Division \\"Zaza\\" consisting of the Cavalry Brigade \\"Pleats\\" and the Cavalry Brigade \\"Edward\\". In accordance with Ribentrop-Molotov Pact, the area came under Soviet occupation and was declared part of the Belastok Region of the Belarusian SSR. In 1939 and 1940 many local inhabitants were arrested and deported to Siberia. Many were arrested and sent to the Gulag. They were replaced with Russian forest workers, but in 1941 the forest came under German occupation and the Russian inhabitants were also deported. Hermann G√∂ring planned to create the biggest hunting reserve in the world there, but those plans were never realized. After July 1941, the forest became a refuge for both Polish and Soviet partisans. The German authorities organized mass executions of people suspected of aiding the resistance. In July 1944 the area was captured by the Red Army. The withdrawing Wehrmacht blew up the historic Bia≈Çowie≈ºa hunting manor. After the war Bia≈Çowie≈ºa was transferred back to the communist Polish People's Republic, yet again recovered and in 1947 became the center of the re-established National Park. Nowadays it is one of the least populated areas in Poland, while at the same time it is one of the most important tourist attractions in the eastern part of the country with almost 100,000 visitors every year. The Reserve was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1992 and internationally recognized as a Biosphere Reserve under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Program in 1993. British historian Simon Schama devotes several chapters of his 1995 book Landscape and Memory to a consideration of the historical vicissitudes of the forests around Bia≈Çowie≈ºa in an effort to explore the ways in which cultural imagination shapes humans' vision of the land. Population Today, the majority of the population of Bia≈Çowie≈ºa is Eastern Orthodox, with a small part identifying as members of the Belarusian ethnic minority.–ê–¥–º–µ—Ç–Ω–∞—Å—å—Ü—å –∂—ã—Ö–∞—Ä–æ—û —Ä—ç–≥—ñ—ë–Ω—É –ë–µ–ª–∞–≤–µ–∂—ã [The specifics of the inhabitants of the Bialowieza area] - Radio Poland Belarusian service, 23/02/2019 The local native dialect is described by linguists as being of Ruthenian origin, predominantly a mixture of Belarusian, Ukrainian with significant elements of Polish and a certain influence of the Russian language.

She was the first ship named in honor of Seth Harding. Launched in 1918, she undertook training exercises off the East Coast of the United States sporadically for several years. In 1919, she escorted a major transatlantic flight of Curtiss NC seaplane. Later that year, she was selected to be converted into a seaplane tender, and was then used to support naval aviator training off Naval Air Station Pensacola. She took one trip to Veracruz with emergency medical supplies, and was also on hand during aircraft bombing tests against decommissioned German ships, including the sinking of . She was decommissioned in 1922 and sold for scrapping in 1936.  Design and construction  Harding was one of 111 s built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with seven of her sisters, were constructed at Union Iron Works shipyards in San Francisco, California using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel. She had a standard displacement of an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . On trials, Harding reached a speed of . She was armed with four 4\\"/50 caliber guns, three .30 caliber machine guns, and twelve torpedo tubes Mark 15 torpedoes. She had a regular crew complement of 122 officers and enlisted men. She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers. Specifics on Hardings performance are not known, but she was one of the group of Wickes-class destroyers known unofficially as the 'Liberty Type' to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works, which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. The 'Liberty' type destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make at instead of the design standard of at . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight. Harding was the first ship to be named for Seth Harding. The second was a , commissioned in 1943. Service history Harding was launched on 4 July 1918 from Union Iron Works. She was sponsored by the wife of George A. Armes, and embarked under the command of Commander Henry D. Cooke. On 3 February 1919, she was assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet and sailed for Newport, Rhode Island via Santa Cruz, California. Transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived on 18 February. Two days later she moved to Boston, Massachusetts and stood out of that harbor on 21 February, to escort which was transporting President Woodrow Wilson from the Versailles Conference. Two days later she participated in ceremonies in Boston harbor celebrating the arrival of that ship. Next, she put in for repairs at Norfolk, Virginia until 8 March, when she left for fleet exercises near Cuba. Following this, Harding left for New York, arriving there on 14 April. On 1 May, she departed as part of a group of destroyers acting as a guide for a flight of Navy Curtiss NC seaplanes across the Atlantic Ocean. Harding provided searchlight illumination by night during the first part of the flight; NC-1 and NC-3 made forced landings near the Azores and Harding rendered assistance to NC-1 before it sank. NC-4, the remaining seaplane, arrived at Ponta Delgada 20 May and as she took off for the last leg of her journey, Harding got underway to provide radio compass signals at sea. After the seaplanes landed at Plymouth, England, to complete the flight on 31 May 1919, Harding visited Brest, France and the Azores before returning to Newport 18 June. For several months, Harding was based out of Newport and Norfolk on training exercises. After the end of World War I, the U.S. Navy began to convert surplus ships to support its growing seaplane tender program. Several steamers and minelayers were selected in 1919, but Harding was the only destroyer, because it was determined that she would require minimal modifications. Following this success, and as aircraft carrier designs advanced, more ships were designed specifically to support naval aviation. Fourteen Clemson-class destroyers were converted to seaplane tenders in 1938 when it was determined that aircraft production was outpacing the development of these ships. During the conversion of Harding, her three .30 caliber machine guns were removed and her crew complement was reduced to 100 officers and enlisted men. Her torpedo tubes may also have been removed. On 13 December 1919, she reported to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion to a seaplane tender. She completed the conversion at Charleston Navy Yard and on 20 May 1920, she sailed for duty at Pensacola Naval Air Station. Immediately after this, though, Harding was loaded with medical supplies from the American Red Cross and was ordered to Veracruz, Mexico, where an outbreak of bubonic plague necessitated serum and other supplies. She reached Veracruz on 9 June 1920 and unloaded her supplies. She then steamed for Pensacola, Florida, stopping at Tampico on the way, and arrived in Florida on 13 June. At Pensacola, Harding was assigned to a seaplane pilot training program. She remained there until 4 August 1920, after which she operated in the Caribbean area tending seaplanes until 23 February 1921. She stopped briefly at Philadelphia before heading to Hampton Roads to support bombing tests on surrendered German ships, leaving Norfolk on 21 June. She was present during the bombing tests on and remained assigned to the tests until the sinking of the German battleship on 21 July 1921. Harding was detached from this duty the next day. Harding subsequently conducted training exercises out of Newport and other East Coast ports until 27 December 1921, when she arrived at Charleston, South Carolina. Remaining there until 3 April 1922, she sailed to Philadelphia where she decommissioned 1 July 1922. Harding was then sold for scrap on 29 September 1936, to Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation in New York City.

Reese is known mainly for his work on medieval and Renaissance music, particularly with his two publications Music in the Middle Ages (1940) and Music in the Renaissance (1954); these two books remain the standard reference works for these two eras, with complete and precise bibliographical material, allowing for almost every piece of music mentioned to be traced back to a primary source. Life Reese was born in New York City. He was an avid scholar and had interests in many areas outside music, including art, architecture, and literature. He is also remarkable in that he lacked formal musicological training. He studied law at New York University, graduating in 1921. Though he was admitted to the New York State Bar, he opted to re-enroll and pursue a Bachelor of Music from NYU, which he received in 1930. In 1927, however, he was already teaching classes at the university in medieval and Renaissance music. He continued teaching there intermittently until 1974, and he became Professor Emeritus in 1973. He also served as a visiting professor at a number of universities, including Harvard, Duke, UCLA, USC, Michigan, Oxford and the Juilliard School of Music. He was a founder- member of the American Musicological Society (AMS) from 1934, serving as its first secretary (1934‚Äì1946). He became vice-president in 1946 and president of the organization in 1950. He has also held positions in the International Musicological Society(IMS), the Renaissance Society of America, and the Plainsong and Medieval Music Society. Also active in the music publishing industry, he headed the publication department of G. Schirmer (1940‚Äì1945) and was also director of publication at Carl Fischer (1945‚Äì1955). Furthermore, he was editor of The Musical Quarterly from 1944 to 1945. Gustave Reese had a profound impact on many generations of music students through his passionate and insightful teaching. He has left a valuable legacy in Music in the Middle Ages and Music in the Renaissance. These two pillars have incited a revival of interest and scholarship in the areas of early music. He is often perceived to have 'raised the bar' of musicological scholarship with his thorough research, intellectual rigour and comprehensive bibliographies. He commissioned other people to contribute specialist sections to these books, such as Igor Buketoff's piece on Russian chant in Music in the Middle Ages.New York Times, 11 September 2001 Reese married Fine Arts administrator and cookbook author and editor Carol Truax in 1974.

Painted between 1600 and 1610, it may have served as the basis for the engraved portrait of Shakespeare used in the First Folio in 1623. It is named after the Dukes of Chandos, who formerly owned the painting. The portrait was given to the National Portrait Gallery, London on its foundation in 1856, and it is listed as the first work in its collection.Tarnya Cooper (ed), Searching for Shakespeare, National Portrait Gallery and Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 54‚Äì61 It has not been possible to determine with certainty who painted the portrait, nor whether it really depicts Shakespeare. However, the National Portrait Gallery believes that it probably does depict the writer. Authorship and provenance Engraved portrait of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout, on the title page of the first publication of his works, the First Folio, shows distinct similarities when compared to the oil painting The \\"Soest Portrait\\" of Shakespeare. The \\"Chesterfield Portrait\\" of Shakespeare. It has been claimed that Shakespeare's friend Richard Burbage (1567‚Äì1619) painted the Chandos portrait,Mary Edmond, \\"The Chandos Portrait: A Suggested Painter\\", The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 124, No. 948, March 1982, pp. 146-147+149. but the first known reference to the painting is in a note written in 1719 by George Vertue, who states that it was painted by John Taylor, a respected member of the Painter-Stainers' company who may also have been the same John Taylor who acted with the Children of Paul's.Cooper et al., 54. Vertue refers to Taylor as an actor and painter and as Shakespeare's \\"intimate friend\\". Katherine Duncan-Jones argues that 'John Taylor' could have been a misreading of what had originally been \\"Jo: Taylor\\"; she suggests that this may refer to the actor Joseph Taylor, who was a prot√©g√© of the older Shakespeare.Katherine Duncan-Jones, \\"A precious memento: The Chandos Portrait and Shakespeare's 'intimate friend'\\", Times Literary Supplement, April 25, 2014, pp.13‚Äì15. Vertue also states that before the Duke of Chandos acquired it, the portrait was owned by Shakespeare's possible godson, William Davenant (1606‚Äì1668), who, according to the gossip chronicler John Aubrey, claimed to be the playwright's illegitimate son. He also states that it was left to Davenant in Taylor's will and that it was bought by Thomas Betterton from Davenant and then sold to the lawyer Robert Keck, a collector of Shakespeare memorabilia. After Keck's death in 1719, it passed to his daughter, and was inherited by John Nichol, who married into the Keck family. Nichol's daughter Margaret married James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos. The painting passed through descent within the Chandos title until Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos sold it to the Earl of Ellesmere in 1848. Ellesmere donated it to the National Portrait Gallery.Werner Habicht, David John Palmer, Roger Pringle, Images of Shakespeare: Proceedings of the Third Congress of the International Shakespeare Association, 1986, International Shakespeare Association Congress, University of Delaware Press, 1986, p.27 Scholarly views A contemporary image of the playwright is the engraving in the posthumously published First Folio of 1623, which was created by Martin Droeshout and was probably commissioned by Shakespeare's friends and family. It is considered likely that the Droeshout engraving is a reasonably accurate likeness because of the use by these close associates and that contemporaries such as Ben Jonson praised it at the time of the publication. Since the man in the Chandos portrait resembles the one in the Droeshout engraving, the similarity lends an indirect legitimacy to the oil painting. A further indication of legitimacy is the fact that the Chandos portrait was the inspiration for two posthumous portraits of Shakespeare, one by Gerard Soest and another, grander one, known as the \\"Chesterfield portrait\\" after a former owner of that painting. These were probably painted in the 1660s or 1670s, within living memory of Shakespeare. The Chesterfield portrait is held by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon. In 2006, art historian Tarnya Cooper of the National Portrait Gallery completed a three-and-a-half- year study of portraits purported to be of Shakespeare and concluded that the Chandos portrait was most likely a representation of Shakespeare. Cooper points to the earring and the loose shirt-ties of the sitter, which were emblematic of poets (the poet John Donne and Shakespeare's patron the Earl of Pembroke sported similar fashions). However, she readily acknowledges that the painting's authenticity cannot be proven. Cooper also notes that the painting has been badly damaged by over-cleaning and retouching. Parts are abraded and some parts have been slightly altered. The hair has been extended and the beard is longer and more pointed than when originally painted. Copies An early copy of the portrait from c.1670, which may give a clearer idea of the original appearance of the beard In addition to the Chesterfield portrait, a copy was made at least as early as 1689, by an unknown artist. Many 18th century images used it as a model for portrayals of Shakespeare. The painting was engraved by Gerard Vandergucht for Nicholas Rowe's 1709 edition of Shakespeare's works. Another print was made by Jacobus Houbraken in 1747. Ethnic interpretations Because the images of Shakespeare are either doubtful in provenance or lacking expression, no one image seems to reconcile well with readers' imaginations. The relatively dusky features have caused repeated comment. George Steevens said that the picture gave Shakespeare \\"the complexion of a Jew, or rather that of a chimney sweeper in the jaundice\\".Schoenbaum, Samuel, Shakespeare's Lives, Oxford University Press, 1991, p.205. According to Ben Macintyre, \\"Some Victorians recoiled at the idea that the Chandos portrait represented Shakespeare. One critic, J. Hain Friswell, insisted 'one cannot readily imagine our essentially English Shakespeare to have been a dark, heavy man, with a foreign expression'.\\"Sunday Times (of London) article by Ben Macintyre, 10 March 2009, \\"Commentary: Portrait alleged to be the face of William Shakespeare\\" http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5877544.ece Friswell agreed with Steevens that the portrait had \\"a decidedly Jewish physiognomy\\" adding that it displayed \\"a somewhat lubricious mouth, red-edged eyes\\" and \\"wanton lips, with a coarse expression.\\"Louis Marder, His Exits and His Entrances: The Story of Shakespeare's Reputation, Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1963, p.203 According to Ernest Jones, the portrait convinced Sigmund Freud that Shakespeare was French: \\"He insisted that his countenance could not be that of an Anglo-Saxon but must be French, and he suggested that the name was a corruption of Jacques Pierre.\\"Ernest Jones, The life and work of Sigmund Freud, Basic Books, vol.1 1961 p.18.

Kirpekar (1985). \\"Ion dependence of the release of noradrenaline by tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine from cat splenic slices.\\" Br. J. Pharmacol. 84 299‚Äì308. At the mechanistic level, TEA has long been known to block voltage-dependent K+ channels in nerve,B. Hille (1967). \\"The selective inhibition of delayed potassium currents in nerve by tetraethylammonium ions.\\" J. Gen. Physiol. 50 1287-1302. and it is thought that this action is involved in the effects of TEA at sympathetic nerve terminals. With respect to activity at the neuromuscular junction, TEA has been found to be a competitive inhibitor at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, although the details of its effect on these receptor proteins are complex.G. Akk and J. H. Steinbach (2003). \\"Activation and block of mouse muscle-type nicotinic receptors by tetraethylammonium.\\" J. Physiol. 551 155-168. TEA also blocks Ca2+ \\\\- activated K+ channels, such as those found in skeletal muscleR. Latorre, C. Vergara, and C. Hidalgo (1982). \\"Reconstitution in planar lipid bilayers of a Ca2+-dependent K+ channel from transverse tubule membranes isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle.\\" Proc. Natl. Acad.

Physiol. 425 117-132. It has also been reported that TEA inhibits aquaporin (APQ) channels,E. M. M√ºller, J. S. Hub, H. Grubm√ºller, and B. L. de Groot (2008). \\"Is TEA an inhibitor for human Aquaporin-1?\\" Pfl√ºgers Arch. 456 663‚Äì669, and references herein. but this still seems to be a disputed issue.R. S√∏gaard and T. Zeuthen (2008). \\"Test of blockers of AQP1 water permeability by a high-resolution method: no effects of tetraethylammonium ions or acetazolamide.\\" Pfl√ºgers Arch. 456 285-92. A partial effect of these voltage-dependent and permeability properties within each system mentioned above is not only due to the aforementioned inhibitory properties of TEA, but also its ability to inhibit Na,K-ATPase. Acting on the extracellular vestibule of the Na,K-ATPase, inhibiting K+ access similar to ouabain, TEA further accentuates the disrupted K, and Na, gradients within each of these systems.1988\\\\.

Hendrix (1949. \\"Neostigmine as antidote to Etamon¬Æ.\\" JAMA 139(11) 733-734.) was explored in a number of different clinical applications, including the treatment of hypertension,S. W. Hoobler, G. K. Moe and R. H. Lyons (1949). \\"The cardiovascular effects of tetraethylammonium in animals and man with special reference to hypertension.\\" Med. Clin. N. Amer. 33 805-832. its major use seems to have been as a probe to assess the capacity for vasodilation in cases of peripheral vascular disease.A. J. P. Graham (1950). \\"Toxic effects in animals and man after tetraethylammonium bromide.\\" Br. Med. J. 2 321-322. Because of dangerous, even fatal reactions in some patients, as well as inconsistent cardiovascular responses, TEA was soon replaced by other drugs. TEA is not orally active.A. M. Boyd et al. (1948). \\"Action of tetraethylammonium bromide.\\" Lancet 251 15-18. Typical symptoms produced in humans include the following: dry mouth, suppression of gastric secretion, drastic reduction of gastric motility, paralysis of urinary bladder, and relief of some forms of pain. Most studies with TEA seem to have been performed using either its chloride or bromide salt without comment as to any distinctions in effect, but Birchall and his co- workers preferred the use of TEA chloride in order to avoid the sedative effects of the bromide ion.R. Birchall et al. (1947). \\"Clinical studies of the pharmacological effects of tetraethyl ammonium chloride in hypertensive persons made in an attempt to select patients suitable for lumbodorsal sympathectomy and ganglioectomy.\\" Am. J. Med. Sci. 213 572-578. =Toxicology= An extensive study of the toxicology of tetraethylammonium chloride in mice, rats and dogs was published by Gruhzit and co-workers in 1948. These workers reported the following symptoms in mice and rats receiving toxic parenteral doses: tremors, incoordination, flaccid prostration, and death from respiratory failure within 10‚Äì30 minutes; dogs exhibited similar symptoms, including incoordination, flaccid prostration, respiratory and cardiac depression, ptosis, mydriasis, erythema, and death from respiratory paralysis and circulatory collapse. After non-lethal doses, symptoms abated within 15‚Äì60 minutes. There was little evidence of toxicity from chronic administration of non-lethal doses.O. M. Gruhzit, R. A. Fisken and B. J. Cooper (1948). \\"Tetraethylammonium chloride [(C2H5)4NCl]. Acute and chronic toxicity in experimental animals.\\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 92 103-107. These investigators recorded the following acute toxicities, as LD50s for TEA chloride (error ranges not shown): :Mouse: 65 mg/kg, i.p.; 900 mg/kg, p.o. :Rat: ~56 mg/kg, i.v.; 110 mg/kg, i.m.; 2630 mg/kg, p.o. :Dog: ~36 mg/kg, i.v.; 58 mg/kg, i.m. Another research group, working at about the same time, but using tetraethylammonium bromide, published the following LD50 data:L. O. Randall, W. G. Peterson and G. Lehmann (1949). \\"The ganglionic blocking actions of thiophanium derivatives.\\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 97 48-57. :Mouse: 38 mg/kg, i.v.; 60 mg/kg, i.p.; >2000 mg/kg, p.o. :Rat: 63 mg/kg, i.v.; 115 mg/kg, i.p. :Dog: 55 mg/kg, i.v. :Rabbit: 72 mg/kg, i.v. Writing in 1950, Graham made some observations on the toxic effects of tetraethylammonium bromide in humans. In one subject, described as a \\"healthy woman\\", 300 mg of tetraethylammonium bromide, i.v., produced incapacitating \\"curariform\\" (i.e., resembling the effects of tubocurarine) paralysis of the skeletal muscles, as well as marked drowsiness. These effects were largely dissipated within 2 hours. Citing the work of other investigators, Graham noted that Birchall had also produced \\"alarming curariform effects\\" in humans with i.v. doses of 32 mg/kg of tetraethylammonium chloride.

It is in the Kwanbuk region and location of the Rason Special Economic Zone. In South Korean pronunciation, the initial \\"R\\" of the name is pronounced as \\"N\\", (ÎÇòÏÑ†, Naseon) as per standard Korean phonology. In 2000, the name was shortened from \\"Rajin-S≈ènbong\\" to \\"Rason\\". During the 1930s, the Japanese called it Rashin; at that time, it was an important port at the end of a railroad line. It was liberated by the Red Army on 14 August 1945. Before 1991, Rason was used by the Soviet Union as an alternative warm-water port in case Vladivostok was unavailable. The Soviet naval facilities were built starting in 1979. From 1993 to 2004, it was administered separately from North Hamgy≈èng as the directly governed city (Chikhalsi) of Rason. Prior to 1993 and from 2004 to 2009, the city had been part of the North Hamgy≈èng Province. Since 2010, the city is a \\"special city\\", again breaking from provincial control, but different from its older designation as a directly governed city. What this means in practice is unclear. Rason borders Hunchun county in Jilin province of China and Khasansky District in Primorsky Krai of Russia. China is making investments in the port as it gives it access to the Sea of Japan. In July 2011, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) gave a green light for China's domestic trade cargo to be shipped via its port of Rajin from northeast to east China. Coal is shipped from nearby Chinese mines to Shanghai. A casino by the sea caters to Chinese visitors.

The fifth tropical cyclone, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, Donna developed south of Cape Verde on August 29, spawned by a tropical wave to which 63 deaths from a plane crash in Senegal were attributed. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Donna by the following day. Donna moved west- northwestward at roughly and by September 1, it reached hurricane status. Over the next three days, Donna deepened significantly and reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (210 km/h) on September 4\\\\. Thereafter, it maintained intensity as it struck the Lesser Antilles later that day. On Sint Maarten, the storm left a quarter of the island's population homeless and killed seven people. An additional five deaths were reported in Anguilla, and there were seven other fatalities throughout the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, severe flash flooding led to 107 fatalities, 85 of them in Humacao alone. Donna further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane early on September 6, and attained peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) twenty-four hours later. The storm then weakened over the next few days, making multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a Category 3 hurricane. Donna generated severe wind gusts of up to 173 mph (278 km/h) over southern portions of the archipelago nation, and prolific rains affected the country and the nearby Turks and Caicos Islands. Several small island communities in the southern regions of The Bahamas were leveled, but no damage total or fatalities were reported. As it neared the United States, Donna encountered weaker steering currents, turned northwestward, and re-intensified. Early on September 10, Donna made landfall on the Florida Keys with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h), the most severe observed there since 1935. Donna then weakened as it paralleled the southwestern Florida peninsula, making landfall south of Naples with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). In the Florida Keys, coastal flooding severely damaged 75% of buildings, destroyed several subdivisions in Marathon. On the mainland, 5,200 houses were damaged, which does not include the 75% of homes damaged at Fort Myers Beach; 50% of buildings were also destroyed in the city of Everglades. Crop losses were also extensive. A total of 50% of the grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crop was lost, and the avocado crop was almost destroyed. In the state of Florida alone, there were 13 deaths and $300 million in losses. Donna weakened over Florida and was a Category 1 hurricane when it re-emerged into the Atlantic from North Florida. By early on September 12, the storm made landfall near Topsail Beach, North Carolina, as a Category 2 hurricane. Donna brought tornadoes and wind gusts up to 100 mph (155 km/h), damaging or destroying several buildings in Eastern North Carolina, while crops were damaged as far as inland. Additionally, storm surge caused significant beach erosion and structural damage at Wilmington and Nags Head. Eight people were killed and there were over 100 injuries. Later on September 12, Donna reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean and continued to move northeastward. The storm struck Long Island, New York, late on September 12 and rapidly weakened inland. On the following day, Donna became extratropical over Maine. Meteorological history On August 29, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa near Dakar. That day, it is estimated a tropical depression developed along the wave southeast of Cape Verde. There was a lack of data for several days, but it is estimated that the system gradually intensified. On September 2, ships in the region suggested there was a tropical storm after reporting winds of over 50 mph (80 km/h). That day, the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system and observed a well-defined eye, along with winds of . Based on the data, the United States Weather Bureau office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, initiated advisories on Hurricane Donna at 22:00 UTC on September 2, about east of the Lesser Antilles. It is estimated that the storm attained hurricane status a day prior. The Azores High to the north was unusually powerful, which caused Donna to move to the west-northwest. When advisories began, Donna was intensifying into a major hurricane, which is the equivalent of a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; it would ultimately maintain this status for nearly eight days. Continuing to the west-northwest, Donna strengthened further, attaining maximum sustained winds of at 00:00 UTC on September 4‚Äîan intensity it maintained for two more days. Operationally, winds were estimated to be . Late on September 4, the eye of Donna moved over Barbuda, Saint Barth√©lemy, Saint Martin, and Anguilla, and passed just south of Anegada. Donna was then well- organized, described in the Monthly Weather Review as akin to \\"an intense, idealized hurricane.\\" A weakening trough to the north turned the hurricane more northwesterly, bringing it within of the north coast of Puerto Rico. The storm then underwent further intensification to Category 4 status on September 6, and reached its first peak of 145 mph (230 km/h) by 00:00 UTC on September 7\\\\. At that time, Donna began turning more to the west as a ridge built to its north, and it soon weakened back to Category 3 status. Over the next few days, the intense hurricane moved slowly through the southern Bahamas without defined steering currents, and the eye passed near or over Mayaguana, Acklins, Fortune Island, and Ragged Island. While passing through the Straits of Florida, Donna brushed the northern coast of Cuba on September 9 with gale- force winds. Subsequently, a cold front moved eastward through the United States and weakened the ridge, causing the hurricane to turn more to the northwest. It re-intensified over warm sea surface temperatures, and the hurricane's minimum barometric pressure dropped to on September 10\\\\. Between 02:00 and 03:00 UTC that day, the eye of Donna crossed through the Florida Keys at Conch Key, just northeast of Marathon, with sustained winds of and gusts to . The hurricane continued to the northwest along the southwest coast of Florida, passing over Goodland with winds of . Donna traversed Naples and Fort Myers before turning inland to the northeast. At 0800 UTC on September 11, Donna exited Daytona Beach into the western Atlantic with winds of about 85 mph (165 km/h), still as an organized hurricane. Accelerating to the northeast due to an approaching trough, the hurricane re-intensified slightly before making landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, early on September 12 with winds of . At 0900 UTC that day, Donna again emerged over open waters near Virginia, although it had weakened, and the eye expanded to over in diameter. Late on September 12, the hurricane made landfall in Westhampton, New York, as a low-end Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 90 mph. On September 13, Donna became extratropical over northern Maine before entering eastern Canada, having become associated with the approaching cold front. After moving across Quebec and Labrador, Donna reached the Labrador Sea and dissipated early on September 14. Preparations At noon on September 3, a hurricane watch was issued for the Leeward Islands, which at 6 p.m. was upgraded to a warning. Also at 6 p.m., hurricane watches were raised for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which at 6 a.m. on September 4, were upgraded to warnings. By 6 a.m. on September 5, hurricane warnings were dropped for the Leeward Islands, and at 9 a.m., southwest Puerto Rico and the Virgin Island's hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings. By noon, all remaining hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico were changed to gale warnings. In Puerto Rico, flood warnings were issued on September 5, although some residents in the region did not heed the notice; many returned to their homes after the hurricane passed to the north. On Vieques Island, about 1,700 United States Marines evacuated to naval ships. Officials advised small boats to remain at port, and thousands of residents evacuated to schools set up as Red Cross shelters. Along the Cuban coast, about 3,000 people evacuated inland or to churches and schools; while in the Bahamas, stores closed and boats were sent to port. Radar animation of Hurricane Donna approaching the Florida Keys Beginning on September 7, hurricane watches were put in place for the Florida coast from Key West to Melbourne. The next day, the watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings from Key West to Key Largo, with hurricane watches raised on the west coast northward to Fort Myers, and gale warnings issued from Key Largo to Vero Beach. By September 11, hurricane warnings were in effect for southern Florida from Daytona Beach on the east coast to Cedar Key on the west coast, including Lake Okeechobee. Gale warnings were in place northward from Cedar Key to St. Marks, as well as from Daytona Beach northward to Savannah, Georgia. Evacuations in the Florida Keys disrupted traffic along the Overseas Highway. The Air Force evacuated 90 Boeing B-47 Stratojets from Homestead Air Reserve Base (At that time Homestead AFB). At Cape Canaveral, the threat of the storm caused the launching of two missiles to be postponed. Most flights out of Miami International Airport were canceled during the storm's approach. Officials closed schools in Miami and the Florida Keys, and recommended residents in low-lying areas of the Florida Keys and southwestern Florida to evacuate. Ultimately, about 12,000 people in southern Florida sought refuge in storm shelters, two of which were damaged during the storm. In Miami-Dade County alone, there were 77 storm shelters housing 10,000 people. At 5 p.m. on September 10, gale warnings were extended northward to Myrtle Beach. At 11 p.m., hurricane warnings were lowered in the Florida Keys but extended northward from Daytona Beach to Savannah, Georgia. At 11 a.m. on September 11, all warnings were lowered south of Vero Beach and along the Florida west coast, while hurricane warnings were extended northward from Savannah to Myrtle Beach. At 5 p.m., hurricane warnings were lowered south of Fernandina Beach, while they were extended northward to include the entire North Carolina coast. Gale warnings were issued northward to Cape May. At 9 p.m., hurricane warnings were extended northward to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued northward to Eastport, Maine. Ships at dock in Newport, Rhode Island were towed out into the bay to weather the storm.Ron Fritz (2008). USS Fred T. Berry DD/DDE 858 Ship's History Addenda: Hurricane Donna. Ron Fritz.

Air France Flight AF343, which was flying from Paris, France to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, attempted to land at the L√©opold S√©dar Senghor International Airport as a layover. However, due to squally weather, the plane instead crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 63 people on board. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Cape Verde on August 30. =Caribbean= Hurricane Donna caused very extensive damage on Saint-Martin, killed 7 and left at least a quarter of the island's population homeless. A weather station in Sint Maarten reported sustained wind gusts of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a pressure reading in the main airport. Donna killed two people on Antigua. During the passing of Hurricane Donna, Anguilla recorded five deaths, including a woman who died when the roof of her house collapsed. Despite passing only north of the island, Donna caused only minor damage on St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands. A station there reported a wind gust of . Some fences were toppled, while several houses were reported to have been damaged or destroyed. Electrical and telephone services were also disrupted. The highest daily rainfall total on the island was , causing minor local flooding. On Saint John, several small boats capsized. While passing to the north of Puerto Rico, Donna produced winds of in San Juan. Along the north coast of the island, high tides of around and strong waves caused coastal flooding. The hurricane dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at at Naguabo in the central portion of the island. Large areas of eastern Puerto Rico received over of precipitation. The hurricane left about 2,500 people homeless on the island. Despite advanced warning of the floods, the hurricane killed 107 people on the island, of which 84 were in Humacao. In Haiti, the southern periphery of the hurricane killed three people in Port au Prince. Later, Donna brushed the north coast of Cuba with strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing damage along much of the coast. In Gibara, the storm wrecked 80 houses. =Turks and Caicos and Bahamas= On Grand Turk in the Turks and Caicos, Donna produced winds of 58 mph (93 km/h), as the strongest winds remained north of the island. However, the storm dropped heavy rainfall of over , much of which fell in a 12‚Äëhour period. Despite the rains, damage there was minor. In the Bahamas, the anemometer at Ragged Island blew away after registering a wind gust. At Mayaguana, where residents evacuated to a missile tracking base, hurricane-force winds raged for 13 hours. The winds largely destroyed the village of Abraham's Bay on the island. Andros experienced hurricane-force winds for a few hours, and winds on Fortune Island were estimated at 173 mph (278 km/h) before the anemometer blew away. The strongest winds remained south of the northwestern Bahamas, which limited damage there. Donna cut communications between several islands. Several small island communities in the southern Bahamas were leveled. North Caicos reported of rainfall in 24 hours.2007 Hurricane Guide: Are You Prepared? Turks & Caicos Islands Red Cross (2007).

Further north between Marathon and Tavernier, an estimated 75% of buildings were extensively damaged. In the former, tides inundated the city and destroyed several subdivisions. In Key West, one death was confirmed, and 71 people were injured. About 564 homes were demolished, and an additional 1,382 were damaged, 583 of them severely. Storm surge inundated parts of the Overseas Highway and washed out several portions near bridges. Many boats and docks were severely damaged or destroyed. Additionally, the pipeline supplying water to the Florida Keys was wrecked in three places. Large tracts of mangrove forest were lost in the western portion of Everglades National Park, while at least 35% of the white heron population in the park were killed. In Everglades, FL, about 50% of buildings were destroyed due to strong winds and coastal flooding. Late on September 11, of water was reported throughout the area. The city briefly became inaccessible due to inundated roads. Many small buildings were destroyed, and roofs were blown off or damaged. Thousands of trees were toppled, blocking portions of the Tamiami Trail. Throughout Collier County, strong winds and coastal flooding combined destroyed 153 homes, inflicted major impact on an additional 409, and 1,049 others suffered minor damage. The turn into southern Florida lessened damage in the Tampa area. Throughout the state of Florida, the storm destroyed 2,156 homes and trailers, severely damaged 3,903, and inflicted minor impact on 30,524 others. Approximately 391 farm buildings were destroyed, an additional 989 suffered extensive impact, and 2,499 others received minor damage. Roughly 174 buildings were demolished, 1,029 received major impact, and 4,254 suffered minor damage. Additionally, 281 boats were destroyed or severely damaged. A total of 50% of grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crops were ruined, and the avocado crop was almost destroyed. With at least $350 million in damage in Florida alone, Donna was the costliest hurricane to impact the state, at the time. Additionally, there were 14 confirmed fatalities: six from drowning, four from heart attacks, two from automobile accidents, and two from electrocution. About 1,188 others were injured. Southeastern United States and Mid-Atlantic The facade of the 1840s-era Bennett's Rice Mill in Charleston, South Carolina; much of the structure was destroyed by a F3 tornado. The storm brought minor impact to Georgia. Wind gusts of along the coast felled trees and tree limbs, resulting in electrical and telephone-service outages. In Brunswick, GA, a power outage at the power plant caused a minor explosion. Heavy rainfall temporarily flooded some streets in the city. Further north in South Carolina, gale-force winds were reported along the coast, but caused little damage. An F3 tornado struck areas just north of Downtown Charleston, destroying several houses and severely damaging a number of others. There were 10 injuries, some of which were caused by flying glass. Damage from this tornado was over $500,000. An F1 tornado also touched down in Garden City Beach, destroying or extensively damaging six buildings.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/1960/9/11/table In Beaufort County, many trees were uprooted, power lines were downed, homes were unroofed, piers were destroyed, and there was significant damage to corn and soybean crops. In North Carolina, Donna brought two tornadoes to the state. An F1 tornado damaged several small buildings in Bladen County. An F2 tornado in Sampson County destroyed a dwelling with eight occupants, all of whom were hospitalized. Along the coast, wind gusts as high as 100 mph (155 km/h) damaged or destroyed several buildings. Additionally crops were damaged as far as inland. Storm tides ranging from above normal caused significant beach erosion and structural damage at Wilmington and Nags Head. Additionally, Topsail Beach was reported to have been 50% destroyed. In Southport, the town docks were almost completely demolished. There were eight deaths, including three from drowning, two from falling trees, two from weather-related traffic accidents, and one from electrocution. At least 100 people were injured enough to require hospitalization. Damage in North Carolina exceeded $5 million, with the worst impact occurring in New Hanover County. In Virginia, the east coast of the state reported hurricane-force winds, while gusts reached up to in Virginia Beach. Strong winds toppled trees and electrical wires, which blocked streets. Additionally, buildings suffered roof damage and broken windows; some structures were completely destroyed. Offshore, rough seas sank or destroyed numerous small crafts, while a vessel was driven aground. The storm killed three people in Virginia; two of the deaths occurred when a barge collided with a freighter and later sank, and another after a man attempted to safeguard his boat. Strong winds and heavy rains were observed in eastern Maryland. Ocean City suffered the worst impact, with over $300,000 in property damage. The storm also damaged crops in the area, especially corn and apples. Effects from the storm in Delaware were similar, with property damage and considerable losses to corn and apple crops. In Pennsylvania, wind gusts up to in the southeastern portions of the state toppled many trees and utility wires. Heavy rains and poor drainage in some areas flooded basements, lawns, and streets. Low-lying areas in Bucks and Montgomery counties were inundated with up to of water after many streams and creeks nearby overflowed. One death in the state was reported after a boy was swept into a swollen creek behind his home in Sharon Hill. Winds as strong as were observed along the coast of New Jersey. Rainfall in the state was generally between , with a peak of near Hammonton. Damage from the storm was most severe in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth, and Ocean counties, where numerous boats, docks, boardwalks, and cottages were damaged or destroyed. A resort area in Cliffwood Beach, New Jersey saw its boardwalk and tourist attractions destroyed by the hurricane, and the area has never recovered. Losses to agriculture were significant, with damage to apple and peach trees \\"considerable\\", the former of which lost about one-third of its crops. Wind damage to corn, Sudan grass, and sorghum resulted in a delay in their harvest. Nine deaths were reported in the state of New Jersey. In southeastern New York, the eye of Donna crossed 10 miles to the eastern tip of Long Island. Heavy rains, hurricane-force winds, and \\"unprecedented\\" high tides were observed. Severe small stream flooding caused significant damage, especially on Long Island, the waterfront of New York City, and further north in Greene County. The storm caused three fatalities in the state, two from drowning and another from a person crushed by a falling tree. The eye of hurricane Donna crossed near the Connecticut and Rhode Island state line, thus much of the damage in Connecticut was in far eastern sections. Strong winds left 15,000 people without telephone service, while 88,000 homes lost electricity. Along the coast, tides caused beach erosion, inundated streets, and weakened foundations. Four seaside cottages were destroyed. Crop damage was isolated and mainly limited to apples and corn. In Rhode Island, the storm brought a wind gust as strong as to Block Island. Telephone and electrical services were severely disrupted. Along the coast, high tides significantly damaged or destroyed about 200 homes at Narragansett Bay and Warwick cove. Damage to these vessels collectively totaled to over $2 million. Agriculture also suffered impact, particularly to fruit, timber, and poultry, especially in Newport and Portsmouth. =Elsewhere in North America= Strong winds were also observed in Massachusetts, with a wind gust of at the Blue Hill Observatory. Extensive losses to apple orchards occurred, as the fruit was blown out of trees. Widespread telephone and power outages were reported. The strong southwest winds associated with Donna, in combination with very little rainfall, led to a significant deposit of salt spray, which whitewashed southwest-facing windows. Many trees and shrubs saw their leaves brown due to the salt. However, in other areas, of precipitation fell, causing some washouts and local flooding. Waves along the coast ripped small boats and pleasure craft from their moorings and subsequently smashed them against rocks or seawalls. In Vermont, winds damaged trees, tree branches, and power lines, causing telephone and electrical service outages in a few communities. Rainfall totals ranged , resulting in washouts in some areas. Damage to apple orchards totaled $50,000. Along the coast of New Hampshire, many boats were smashed or damaged in some way. Strong winds felled trees and power lines, causing residents in the southern portions of the state to lose telephone service and electricity. Additionally, apple orchards suffered $200,000 in damage. Rainfall in the state peaked at near Peterborough, resulting in local flooding and washouts. Along the coast, large waves damaged 15 to 20 boats in Falmouth, Maine harbor. Total boat damage was estimated at $250,000. Coastal residents in low-lying beach areas of Cumberland and York counties were evacuated in Maine. Several counties lost power during the storm. In Southwest Harbor, lightning struck the Dirigo Hotel, causing a fire that resulted in $100,000 in damages. Winds caused a loss of telephone and electrical services in the Auburn-Lewiston area due to falling trees or tree branches. Television antennas were damaged, as were several signs, including a Sears sign. In addition, 25% to 40% of the apple crop was destroyed. After becoming extratropical, the remnants of Donna continued northeastward into New Brunswick, Quebec, and then Labrador. Wind gusts of in Quebec snapped electrical poles and trees. One death occurred when a man suffered a heart attack when his home was threatened by a fire. Additionally, weather-related traffic accidents in the province resulted in two injuries. Depictions in popular culture Nobel Prize-winner John Steinbeck wrote about Hurricane Donna in his 1962 non-fiction memoir Travels with Charley: In Search of America. Steinbeck had had a truck fitted with a custom camper-shell for a journey he intended to take across the United States, accompanied by his poodle Charley. He planned on leaving after Labor Day from his home in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York. Steinbeck delayed his trip slightly due to Donna, which made a direct hit on Long Island. Steinbeck wrote of saving his boat during the middle of the hurricane, during which he jumped into the water and was blown to shore clinging to a fallen branch driven by the high winds. It was an exploit which foreshadowed his fearless, or even reckless, state of mind to dive into the unknown. The winds of Donna can be seen in the feature film Blast of Silence (1961); a fist fight scene on Long Island had been previously scheduled, and the filmmakers decided to go ahead and shoot the exterior scene despite the hurricane. Aftermath, records and retirement Following the storm, President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a disaster declaration for Florida and North Carolina, allowing residents of those states to be eligible for public assistance. The United States military sent a plane carrying doctors and food from Patrick Air Force Base to Mayaguana in the Bahamas. Crews of doctors and workers with food and supplies left from Key West and Miami to traverse the Florida Keys, bringing aid to affected residents. In Marathon, a large reconstruction program rehabilitated the key by Christmas. Coral reefs were damaged in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary by the hurricane. Donna caused a significant negative impact on aquatic life in north Florida Bay. Marine life was either stranded by retreating salt water which had been driven inland or killed by muddied waters in its wake. Oxygen depletion due to animals perishing in the hurricane caused additional mortality. Although salinity levels returned to normal within six weeks, dissolved oxygen concentrations remained quite low for a longer time frame. Marine life was scarce for several months in areas of greatest oxygen depletion. Sports fishing in the area took a few months to recover. Juvenile pink shrimp moved from their estuarine nursery grounds into deeper water about offshore, where they were subsequently captured by fishermen. A Caspian tern was swept up the North American coast well to the north of its traditional breeding grounds, to Nova Scotia, which was witnessed four hours after the storm went by Digby Neck. Because of its devastating impacts and the high mortality associated with the hurricane, the name \\"Donna\\" was retired, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane; the name was replaced by \\"Dora\\" in 1964.

The goal is to make inferences about a criterion that is not directly accessible to the decision maker, based on recognition retrieved from memory. This is possible if recognition of alternatives has relevance to the criterion. For two alternatives, the heuristic is defined as: Full text (PDF). The recognition heuristic is part of the \\"adaptive toolbox\\" of \\"fast and frugal\\" heuristics proposed by Gigerenzer and Goldstein. It is one of the most frugal of these, meaning it is simple or economical. In their original experiment, Daniel Goldstein and Gerd Gigerenzer quizzed students in Germany and the United States on the populations of both German and American cities. Participants received pairs of city names and had to indicate which city has more inhabitants. In this and similar experiments, the recognition heuristic typically describes about 80‚Äì90% of participants' choices, in cases where they recognize one but not the other object (see criticism of this measure below). Surprisingly, American students scored higher on German cities, while German participants scored higher on American cities, despite only recognizing a fraction of the foreign cities. This has been labeled the \\"less-is-more effect\\" and mathematically formalized.  Domain specificity  The recognition heuristic is posited as a domain- specific strategy for inference. It is ecologically rational to rely on the recognition heuristic in domains where there is a correlation between the criterion and recognition. The higher the recognition validity Œ± for a given criterion, the more ecologically rational it is to rely on this heuristic and the more likely people will rely on it. For each individual, Œ± can be computed by :Œ± = C/(C+W) where C is the number of correct inferences the recognition heuristic would make, computed across all pairs in which one alternative is recognized and the other is not, and W is the number of wrong inferences. Domains in which the recognition heuristic was successfully applied include the prediction of geographical properties (such as the size of cities, mountains, etc.), of sports events (such as Wimbledon and soccer championships) and elections. Research also shows that the recognition heuristic is relevant to marketing science. Recognition based heuristics help consumers choose which brands to buy in frequently purchased categories. A number of studies addressed the question of whether people rely on the recognition heuristic in an ecologically rational way. For instance, name recognition of Swiss cities is a valid predictor of their population (Œ± = 0.86) but not their distance from the center of Switzerland (Œ± = 0.51). Pohl reported that 89% of inferences accorded with the model in judgments of population, compared to only 54% in judgments of the distance. More generally, there is a positive correlation of r = 0.64 between the recognition validity and the proportion of judgments consistent with the recognition heuristic across 11 studies. Another study by Pachur suggested that the recognition heuristic is more likely a tool for exploring natural rather than induced recognition (i.e. not provoked in a laboratory setting) when inferences have to be made from memory. In one of his experiments, the results showed that there was a difference between participants in an experimental setting vs. a non-experimental setting.  Less-is-more effect  If Œ± > Œ≤, and Œ±, Œ≤ are independent of n, then a less-is-more effect will be observed. Here, Œ≤ is the knowledge validity, measured as C/(C+W) for all pairs in which both alternatives are recognized, and n is the number of alternatives an individual recognizes. A less-is-more effect means that the function between accuracy and n is inversely U-shaped rather than monotonically increasing. Some studies reported less-is-more effects empirically among two, three, or four alternatives and in group decisions), whereas others failed to do so, possibly because the effect is predicted to be small (see Katsikopoulos). Smithson explored the \\"less-is-more effect\\" (LIME) with the recognition heuristic and challenges some of the original assumptions. The LIME occurs when a \\"recognition-dependent agent has a greater probability of choosing the better item than a more knowledgeable agent who recognizes more items.\\" A mathematical model is used in describing the LIME and Smithson‚Äôs study used it and attempted to modify it. The study was meant to mathematically provide an understanding of when the LIME occurs and explain the implications of the results. The main implication is \\"that the advantage of the recognition cue depends not only on the cue validities, but also on the order in which items are learned\\".  Neuropsychological evidence  The recognition heuristic can also be depicted using neuroimaging techniques. A number of studies have shown that people do not automatically use the recognition heuristic when it can be applied, but evaluate its ecological validity. It is less clear, however, how this evaluation process can be modeled. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study tested whether the two processes, recognition and evaluation, can be separated on a neural basis. Participants were given two tasks; the first involved only a recognition judgment (\\"Have you ever heard of Modena? Milan?\\"), while the second involved an inference in which participants could rely on the recognition heuristic (\\"Which city has the larger population: Milan or Modena?\\"). For mere recognition judgments, activation in the precuneus, an area that is known from independent studies to respond to recognition confidence, was reported. In the inference task, precuneus activation was also observed, as predicted, and activation was detected in the anterior frontomedian cortex (aFMC), which has been linked in earlier studies to evaluative judgments and self-referential processing. The aFMC activation could represent the neural basis of this evaluation of ecological rationality. Some researchers have used event-related potentials (ERP) to test psychological mechanisms behind the recognition heuristic. Rosburg, Mecklinger, and Frings used a standard procedure with a city-size comparison task, similar to that used by Goldstein and Gigerenzer. They used ERP and analyzed familiarity-based recognition occurring 300-450 milliseconds after stimulus onset in order to predict the participants‚Äô decisions. Familiarity- based recognition processes are relatively automatic and fast so these results provide evidence that simple heuristics like the recognition heuristic utilize basic cognitive processes.  Controversies  Research on the recognition heuristic has sparked a number of controversies. = Trade-offs = The recognition heuristic is a model that relies on recognition only. This leads to the testable prediction that people who rely on it will ignore strong, contradicting cues (i.e., do not make trade-offs; so-called noncompensatory inferences). In an experiment by Daniel M. Oppenheimer participants were presented with pairs of cities, which included actual cities and fictional cities. Although the recognition heuristic predicts that participants would judge the actual (recognizable) cities to be larger, participants judged the fictional (unrecognizable) cities to be larger, showing that more than recognition can play a role in such inferences. Newell & Fernandez performed two experiments to try to test the claims that the recognition heuristic is distinguished from availability and fluency through binary treatment of information and inconsequentiality of further knowledge. The results of their experiments did not support these claims. Newell & Fernandez and Richter & Sp√§th tested the non-compensatory prediction of the recognition heuristic and stated that \\"recognition information is not used in an all-or-none fashion but is integrated with other types of knowledge in judgment and decision making.\\" A reanalysis of these studies at an individual level, however, showed that typically about half of the participants consistently followed the recognition heuristic in every single trial, even in the presence of up to three contradicting cues. Furthermore, in response to those criticisms, Marewski et al. pointed out that none of the studies above formulated and tested a compensatory strategy against the recognition heuristic, leaving the strategies that participants relied on unknown. They tested five compensatory models and found that none could predict judgments better than the simple model of the recognition heuristic. = Measurement = One major criticism of studies on the recognition heuristic that was raised was that mere accordance with the recognition heuristic is not a good measure of its use. As an alternative, Hilbig et al. proposed to test the recognition heuristic more precisely devised a multinomial processing tree model for the recognition heuristic. A multinomial processing tree model is a simple statistical model often used in cognitive psychology for categorical data. Hilbig et al. claimed that a new model of recognition heuristic use was needed due to the confound between recognition and further knowledge. The multinomial processing tree model was shown to be effective and Hilbig et al. claimed that it provided an unbiased measure of the recognition heuristic. Pachur stated that it is an imperfect model but currently it is still the best model to predict people‚Äôs recognition-based inferences. He believes that precise tests have a limited value basically because certain aspects of the recognition heuristic are often ignored and so the results could be inconsequential or misleading. = Intuitive strategy = Hilbig et al. state that heuristics are meant to reduce effort and that the recognition heuristic reduces effort in making judgments by relying on one single cue and ignoring other information. In their study, they found that the recognition heuristic is more useful in deliberate thought than in intuitive thought. This means it is more useful when thoughts are intentional and not impulsive as opposed to intuitive thought, which is based more on impulse rather than conscious reasoning. In contrast, a study by Pachur and Hertwig found that it is actually the faster responses that are more in line with the recognition heuristic. Also, judgments accorded more strongly with the recognition heuristic under time pressure. In line with these findings, neural evidence suggests that the recognition heuristic may be relied upon by default.  Support  Goldstein and Gigerenzer state that due to its simplicity, the recognition heuristic shows to what degree and in what situations behavior can be predicted. Some researchers suggest that the idea of the recognition heuristic should be retired but Pachur believes that a different approach should be taken in testing it. There are some researchers who believe that the recognition heuristic should be investigated using precise tests of the exclusive use of recognition. Another study by Pachur suggested that the recognition heuristic is more likely a tool for exploring natural rather than induced recognition (i.e. not provoked in a laboratory setting) when inferences have to be made from memory. In one of his experiments, the results showed that there was a difference between participants in an experimental setting vs. a non-experimental setting.  Synopsis  Using an adversarial collaboration approach, three special issues of the open access journal Judgment and Decision Making have been devoted to unravel the support for and problems with the recognition heuristic, providing the most recent and comprehensive synopsis of the epistemic status quo. In their Editorial to Issue III, the three guest editors strive for a cumulative theory integration.

Its name comes from (Pagus) Medullicus, or \\"country of the Medulli\\", the local Celtic tribe. The region owes its economic success mainly to the production of red wine; it is home to around 1,500 vineyards. The area also has pine forests and long sandy beaches. The M√©doc's geography is not ideal for wine growing, with its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean resulting in a comparatively mild climate and high rainfall making rot a constant problem. It is generally believed that the nature of the region's wine derives from the soil; although the terrain is flat, excellent drainage is a necessity and the increased amount of gravel in the soil allows heat to be retained, encouraging ripening, and extensive root systems. Viticulture With the exception of Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion from Graves, all of the red wines in the 1855 Classification are from the M√©doc. Many of the M√©doc wines that are not in this classification were classified using the Cru Bourgeois system until 2007. Following legal challenges this category was abolished, and reintroduced in 2010 as an annual \\"mark of quality\\" depending on independent annual assessment.

It is near the Salmon River. Otis post office was established in 1900 and was named after Otis Thompson, nephew of Archibald S. Thompson, the postmaster. U.S. Route 101 used to pass through Otis until a curvy and hilly section of road was rerouted in the 1960s. Otis Junction is at the intersection of the former terminus of Oregon Route 18 and the former alignment of U.S. 101. The Sitka Center for Art and Ecology has an Otis mailing address but is located nearer to the coast on Cascade Head. The Otis ZIP code, 97368, also covers the community of Rose Lodge. Today Otis and Otis Junction are considered synonymous. Otis made the national headlines in 1999 and again in 2004, when it was announced that the town was for sale for $3 million. The news stories describe the Otis Caf√© and other amenities that are at Otis Junction; it is unclear if the that were for sale included the land in Otis proper. Owner Vivian Lematta's grandfather bought the land from descendants of the Siletz Indians for $800 in 1910. Lematta left Otis in 1957. Included in the sale were the gas station and mini grocery store, a Pronto Pup corn dog stand, two houses, an empty 25-stall horse barn, a helicopter storage shed, a garage, a Grange hall, the Otis post office, the Otis Caf√©, an auto-repair garage and of farmland. Part of the land was used for raising cattle and part was undergoing timber conservation.

Permissible exposure limits are established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Most of OSHA's PELs were issued shortly after adoption of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act in 1970. For chemicals, the chemical regulation is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm), or sometimes in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). Units of measure for physical agents such as noise are specific to the agent. A PEL is usually given as a time-weighted average (TWA), although some are short-term exposure limits (STEL) or ceiling limits. A TWA is the average exposure over a specified period, usually a nominal eight hours. This means that, for limited periods, a worker may be exposed to concentration excursions higher than the PEL, so long as the TWA is not exceeded and any applicable excursion limit is not exceeded. An excursion limit typically means that \\"...worker exposure levels may exceed 3 times the PEL-TWA for no more than a total of 30 minutes during a workday, and under no circumstances should they exceed 5 times the PEL-TWA, provided that the PEL-TWA is not exceeded.\\" Excursion limits are enforced in some states (for example Oregon) and on the federal level for certain contaminants such as asbestos. A short-term exposure limit is one that addresses the average exposure over a 15-30 minute period of maximum exposure during a single work shift. A ceiling limit is one that may not be exceeded for any time, and is applied to irritants and other materials that have immediate effects. Regulatory agencies for occupational noise exposure =OSHA= The current PEL for OSHA standards are based on a 5 decibel exchange rate. OSHA's PEL for noise exposure is 90 decibels (dBA) for an 8-hour TWA. Levels of 90-140 dBA are included in the noise dose. PEL can also be expressed as 100 percent ‚Äúdose‚Äù for noise exposure. When the noise exposure increases by 5 dB, the exposure time is cut in half. According to OSHA, a 95dBA TWA would be a 200 percent dose. PEL is exceeded when TWA > 90 dBA. OSHA requires feasible engineering OR administrative controls, and mandatory hearing protection when the PEL is exceeded. =MSHA= Like OSHA, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) also uses the same 5 decibel exchange rate and 90 dBA for an 8-hour TWA for their PEL. Once a miner's noise exposure exceeds the PEL, feasible engineering AND administrative controls must be in place to try to limit the noise exposure of the employees. If a mine operator uses administrative controls, procedures for such controls must be posted on the bulletin board and a copy must be supplied to all affected employees. =NIOSH= The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) for noise exposure uses a 3 decibel exchange rate. The recommendation for occupational noise exposure is 85 decibels (dBA) for an 8-hour TWA. For every 3 dB over 85, the exposure time is cut in half.
