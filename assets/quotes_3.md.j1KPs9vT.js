In concept it was similar to other tribute-labor systems, such as the mita of the Inca Empire or the corv√©e of Ancien R√©gime France: the natives were forced to do low-paid for a certain number of weeks or months each year on farms, mines, workshops (obrajes), and public projects. With the New Laws of 1542, the repartimiento was instated to substitute the encomienda system that had come to be seen as abusive and promoting unethical behavior. The repartimiento was not slavery, in that the worker is not owned outright‚Äîbeing free in various respects other than in the dispensation of his or her labor‚Äîand the work was intermittent. However, it created slavery-like conditions in certain areas, most notoriously in silver mines of 16th century Peru. In the first decades of the colonization of the Caribbean the word was used for the institution that became the encomienda, which can cause confusion. It was a way for people to pay tribute by doing laborious jobs for the mother country. The repartimiento, for the most part, replaced the encomienda throughout the Viceroyalty of New Spain by the beginning of the 17th century. In Peru encomiendas lasted longer, and the Quechua word mita frequently was used for repartimiento. There were instances when both systems (repartimiento and encomienda) coexisted. In practice, a conquistador, or later a Spanish settler or official, would be given and supervised a number of indigenous workers, who would labor in farms or mines, or in the case of the Philippines might also be assigned to the ship yards constructing the Manila galleons. The one in charge of doing the reparto (\\"distribution\\") of workers was the Alcalde Mayor (local magistrate) of the city. Native communities that were close to Spanish populations were required to provide a percentage of their people (2-4%) to work in agriculture, construction of houses, streets, etc. The diminution of the number of natives in the Americas due to European diseases (smallpox, influenza, measles and typhus) to which the native populations had no resistance, as well as to desertion from the work fields, led to the substitution of the encomienda system and the creation of privately owned farms and haciendas. Many native people escaped the encomienda and repartimiento by leaving their communities. Some looked for wage labor; others signed contracts (asientos) for six months to a year, during which time the worker was required to be paid a salary (something the Spanish Crown did not enforce or support), and provided living quarters as well as religious services. There were many cases in which both wage and repartimiento laborers worked side by side on farms, mines, obrajes or haciendas.

According to the , it has a population of people. The town is being pushed to be included in the UNESCO World Heritage List due to its impressive array of colonial structures with hints of indigenous Mindanaoan architecture. Barangays Balingasag is politically subdivided into 30 barangays. History Balingasag started as a pre-Hispanic settlement, which was eventually discovered by the Spaniards when they came to colonize the Philippines. Presumably, the name came from two contracted Cebuano words \\"baling\\", which means fishing net, and \\"kasag\\", crab. Legend has it that one day during the Spanish regime a group of guardia civil, while patrolling the seashore near the settlement of the natives, chanced upon some fishermen pulling fishing nets. A guardia civil asked a fisherman for the name of the place. Not understanding the language and thinking that he was asked what he what was doing, the fisherman, pointing his finger to the net, answered ‚Äúbaling‚Äù, and then turning it to the contents of the boat nearby, added ‚Äúkasag‚Äù. According to early accounts, the present town site of Balingasag was heavily forested, making it the favorite hiding place of bandits and pirates, who constantly terrorized the inhabitants. One of the notorious groups marauding the area was that of Datu Gumpot, who made the area now occupied by Cala-cala, a sitio of Barangay Cogon, as his base. This place was then known as Gumpot Kitagtag. The presence of these lawless elements in the area made the inhabitants evacuate to safer places every now and then. Gumpot's group later on disappeared and never came back. This motivated the natives to settle. One group, however, moved to Galas, a part of the place known as Sabangan, an area somewhere between what is now Barangay Waterfall and Barangay Baliwagan. The other group remained at Gumpot Kitagtag. Galas was ruled by Datu Marcos and his wife, Ba‚Äôai Gregoria. On the other hand, Gumpot Kitagtag was under Datu Mateo and his wife Ba‚Äôai Tomasa. Though these rulers now had their own territory, they remained true and loyal to each other. Marriages between the members of these two tribes further strengthened the bond that had since bound the two leaders. Notable of these conjugal unions was that of Marcos Antonio, the son of Datu Marcos, and Rita Gregoria, the daughter of Datu Mateo. Eventually, these two great leaders died and were succeeded by their sons. Marcos Antonio became the Datu of Galas and Manuel Mateo ruled Gumpot Kitagtag. These new leaders maintained the alliance established by their predecessors. They constantly communicated with each other and discussed means, or undertook activities, to improve their settlements. In one of their meetings, the idea of establishing a common place, where the members of their tribes could meet and conduct commercial or social activities, was developed. The two rulers, together with their respective followers, presented their choices. Finally, they decided to locate their meeting place or ‚Äúpoblacion‚Äù diha tungod nianang balinganan ta sa kasag (in the place where we catch crabs). This place was part of Galas. The ‚Äúpoblacion‚Äù grew and became popular. In 1749, the Spanish Authority recognized the place and the whole territory of Sabangan under the name Balingasag. Thus, Sabangan could be considered as the old Balingasag. In 1790, a great flood swept Sabangan, leaving the inhabitants nothing but desolation and depression. After the flood, the leader of Galas this time, Datu Antonio Ramon, the son of Datu Marcos Antonio, proposed to his followers the notion of transferring their settlement to a safer place. The inhabitants loved their place so much that they disagreed with the idea of their chieftain. In the end, however, the leader prevailed upon the followers. Datu Antonio Ramon and his followers eyed Gumpot Kitagtag, now under the control of Datu Mamerto Manuel, the son and successor of Datu Manuel Mateo, as the ideal place to relocate. Negotiations ensued. After the conditions were agreed by both parties, the transfer began sometime in 1793 and was completed in 1810. One of the important agreements between the two groups was to divide the poblacion into two. The present Rizal Street, then called Calle Real, which now traverses the span between the gate of Balingasag Central School and the town's wharf, became the demarcation line. All lots on the right side of this street, when facing mountain, and all agricultural lands as far as Baliwagan, would belong to Datu Antonio Ramon and his followers. To Datu Mamerto Manuel and his followers went all the lots on the opposite side of the poblacion and all the agricultural lands as far as Mandangoa. Governor General Narciso Claveria issued on 21 November 1841 a decree (Renovacion de Apellidos) requiring the natives to change their family names and if they had none, they have to adopt a new one. Consequently, Datu Mamerto Manuel chose ‚ÄúValmores‚Äù as his surname, while Datu Antonio Ramon opted for ‚ÄúMadro√±o‚Äù. Balingasag, being the name recognized by the Spanish Authority, gradually replaced the name of the territory that was Gumpot Kitagtag. In 1842, Balingasag was finally given official recognition as a town through a Spanish Royal Decree. If this royal decree were the basis of the existence of the present Balingasag, Mamerto Manuel Valmores and Antonio Ramon Madro√±o would then be considered as the ‚ÄúFounding Patriarchs‚Äù of this municipality. The royal recognition of Balingasag as a political or administrative entity under the Spanish sovereignty engendered new systems and structures of governance, which supplanted the indigenous ways of running community affairs. This time the head of the community was the gobernadorcillo, which bore the title capitan. This position is equivalent to the present day Municipal Mayor. Mamerto Manuel Valmores was appointed in 1820 as the first gobernadorcillo of the town. The last gobernadorcillo was Leon Valmores. Holding this position for about 16 years (1822-1837), Francisco Anuario Valmores, the eldest son of Mamerto Manuel, may be considered as the longest serving gobernadorcillo. New leaders had surfaced as changes in the Philippine government took place. Faustino Vega became the first town executive, which has known that time as presidente local, under the short-lived First Philippine Republic (1898-1903). Melquiades Vega, the son of Faustino Vega, served as the first presidente local under the American Regime (1903-1928). Ramon Neri Lude√±a became the first mayor under the Commonwealth Government while Jose P. Roa served the same position during World War II (1938-1944). The first municipal mayor under the Republic of the Philippines was Gorgonio B. Tagarda. The more recent elected town mayors included Manuel Varquez; Alejo E. Olano, Sr; Porferio R. Roa; Andrea H. Borromeo, Felix H. Borromeo and lawyer Alexis Quina, who is known for civil development. Marietta R.

Neri, A.M.M. Ragrario, E.C.R. Robles, and A.J. Carlos, the original settlers of Initao were the Bukidnons. They were described as warlike and aggressive and ready to sacrifice their lives in defending their territory. It is said that the early community in Initao was ruled by three (3) brothers named Datu Hukom, Datu Tamparong, and Datu Pulagoyan, who had to protect early settlers in Initao against Moro invasions in the sixteenth century. Because of the frequent threat by the Moro pirates, the people of Initao became war-like. They were considered to be /hot-blooded/ and /hot-tempered/ fearless fighters. Hence, the word Initao comes from the word init which means ‚Äúhot‚Äù and tao which means ‚Äúpeople.‚Äù They were people perpetually prepared to fight their enemy to defend their territory and community. Legend also has it that the Moro raiders were defeated, the people planted bamboo along the Initao River as a symbol of peace and truce among them. The word Initao, originally spelled by the Spaniards as Ynitao, was mentioned on August 6, 1838, in the inventory of livestock, fruits, exotic and cereal plants in the Provincia de Misamis (Ereccion de Pueblos, Misamis 1808-1839). In May 1858, Ynitao was headed by Gobernadorcillo Francisco Antonio and succeeded by Gobernadorcillo Abariano Caburratan in 1894. In 1838, Initao was a Spanish pueblo composed of 3 cabecerias (Ereccion de Pueblos, Misamis 1808-1839). In October 27, 1877, Ynitao had 7 cabecerias which became 8 on June 30, 1882. It was decreased to 1 cabeceria, known as Apas, on June 30, 1883, until 1884 with a total population of 1,514. On June 30, 1887, Ynitao again increased its number of cabeceria to 19 and decreased to 12 in October 3, 1892. In 1896-1902, Ynitao was in the province of Lanao. In 1903, Initao once again became a pueblo. The municipality is one of the oldest in the western part of Misamis Oriental. In 1957, the barrio of Naawan, then part of Initao, was constituted into the town of Naawan. Demographics In the , the population of Initao, Misamis Oriental, was people, with a density of .

Although its land is mostly rocky, it is able to maintain and support its lush vegetation and its main rivers, Cabulig, Dumagooc and Mandangisiao. Barangays Jasaan is politically subdivided into 15 barangays, of which 8 are coastal barangays (Aplaya, Solana, Luz Banzon, Kimaya, Lower Jasaan, Bobuntugan, Jampason and San Antonio) and 7 inland barangays (Upper Jasaan, Corrales, San Isidro, Natubo, Danao, San Nicolas, and Ignacio S. Cruz). Climate History In 1830, the mission of Jasaan was established separately from Cagayan de Oro, where its authority and evangelization reached as far as the towns of Sumilao, Linabo and Malitbog in the province of Bukidnon. The center of civilization of the new parish and its first Church was at \\"Daanglungsod,\\" which is now the Aplaya, Jasaan, where an old kota (watchtower) still exists. This kota, however, has been moved a few meters from where it originally stood to allow for the construction of the national highway in the 1970s. Father Gregorio Parache, S.J. (432 local historical sources of Northern Mindanao by Father Francisco Demetrio, S.J.), was the parish priest of Jasaan at that time. The Jesuits later built the Nuestra Senora de Immaculada Concepcion Church in what is now the Immaculate Conception Church of Jasaan. The original facade of the church has been modified after a series of renovations. The original altar of the church has been moved backward to allow a larger area for the faithful inside the church building. The original sacristy has been moved to the side. The church is registered as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA). Jasaan is believed to have been already a municipality during the establishment of the Immaculate Conception Parish in 1840. The old church bells (four of them, excluding the one now at the San Agustin Cathedral at Cagayan de Oro) of the Immaculate Conception Church of Jasaan bore these inscriptions around its outer rim: \\"Para El Pueblo de Jasaan 1860\\" [more or less], which suggests that the Spanish government had recognized Jasaan as a town. With the coming of the Americans at the turn of the 20th century, the national government in 1903 downgraded the political status of Jasaan from that of a municipality to a barrio (a Spanish subdivision of a municipio) and made it a part of the Municipality of Balingasag. The Philippine Commission of 1903, Act No. 960, combined some municipalities in 1903 because the civil government had no control of these municipalities. They could not be defended by the Philippine constabulary or the scouts, nor could they be governed by the pro-American inhabitants!\\"Philippine Commission Act 960 The Jasaanons called for the restoration of their municipio into a municipality. Eventually, on August 18, 1948, by virtue of Executive Order No. 165, issued by President Elpidio Quirino, Jasaan regained its municipal status. On November 10, 1948, Jasaan was inaugurated as a municipality, and a set of appointed municipal officials assumed office (from the website of Jasaan Local Government). The early 1970s saw the installation of electric power lines and a road widening program. Ubos had some remnant of Hispanic-style houses along its main street, but these were razed by fire in the early 1980s. Demographics Rizal Street, Upper Jasaan In the , the population of Jasaan, Misamis Oriental, was people, with a density of . Approximately 20 percent of its 45,310 inhabitants live in the urban center.Philippine Statistics Authority, nap.psa.gov.ph The population is mostly composed of descendants of those who settled there in the mid-1800s. Most of them are related by consanguinity and they speak a dialect uniquely Jasaanon. Economy People are dependent on coconut, livestock and cattle. Other agricultural products, such as corn and vegetables, were minimal. Employment was provided primarily by the government through the public school system, a few national government agencies and the local government unit. Trading and merchandising was mostly confined to Ubos (now Lower Jasaan) along a stretch ending at the public market. With the coming of electricity in the late 1960s, Jasaan slowly developed into an industrial town. Resins Incorporated and Philippine Iron Construction and Marine Works (PICMW) established their plants at Nahalinan, a village which is a part of Lower Jasaan. The Pilipinas Kao, another industrial plant, was established at Luz Banzon in the 1970s. A substation of the National Power Corporation has been established in Aplaya. Vertical infrastructure in the municipality of Jasaan improved when pavement and widening of the national highway that extends the whole of Northern Mindanao was completed in the 1970s. At the turn of the millennium, Jasaan has gradually metamorphosed into a resort town. Entrepreneurs have capitalized on the abundance of its spring water sources. The town has spring resorts which draw visitors from neighboring areas. Attractions A number of water resorts have been built in the town. The Sagpulon Falls in San Isidro is a tourist attraction. The Napapong Spring is also an attraction from Corrales. The local tourism office of Jasaan maintains the area to preserve is natural allure. The marine sanctuary is located at the waters around the white sands of Agutayan Island, five kilometers off the coast of Bobuntugan. Celebrations and holidays The Christmas season in Jasaan used to end on February 2, to commemorate the feast of the Presentation of the Child Jesus at the Temple and the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The town calendar of activities was associated with the calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. After the Lenten celebration, Jasaanons used to celebrate a second town fiesta on May 5, to honor St. Augustine. Then there was a lull until the All Souls Day, when Jasaanons from all over came to pay respects for their dead. This was followed by the parochial fiesta on December 8, and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. =Lubong-lubong= During the 1960s, the Jasaanon had a calendar of activities that included a New Year's celebration with a \\"lubong-lubong\\"‚Äìa ritual marking the death of an old year and rejoicing in the birth of a new year. \\"Lubong-lubong\\" (\\"lubong\\" is vernacular for \\"to bury\\") was a mock burial, performed in the town plaza. It began with a masked old man in tattered clothes plodding around the hall where townsfolk gathered in merriment to greet the coming year. As the countdown to the New Year continued, the old man in tattered clothes disappeared in the dark. A little tot in diapers appeared in the midst of hall as the church tolled the knell of the dying year. The ringing shifted to the pealing of all the church bells in the twin belfries of the Immaculate Conception Church to mark the New Year. The Jasaanon was then led to the main door of the church, where a funeral bier awaited. A mock person tagged with the year that passed was laid on top of it, and a man dressed in tattered black cloth recited Latin prayer and led people through a funeral march, which ended at the gates of the Catholic cemetery. The bier was left at the gates to end the ritual. Town center, poblacion Immaculate Conception Church The town center or poblacion of Jasaan is a picture of the Spanish Catholic concept of settlement model‚Äì\\"bajo de las campanas\\"‚Äìwhere people live around the vicinity of the church within earshot of the peal of the bells. There used to be a bell at the belfry of the Nuestra Senora de la Inmaculada Concepcion Church, where the peal could be heard as far as the hills of Natubo. This town center used to be one big poblacion, subdivided into nine puroks (hamlets): Purok Uno, Purok Dos, Purok Tres, Purok Cuatro, Purok Cinco, Purok Seis, Purok Siete, Purok Ocho, and Purok Nueve. In the 1960s, these villages adopted names, such as like Siga-Siga, Mauswagon and Mabuligon, etc. In the early 1970s, when martial law was in force, then-President Ferdinand Marcos (by a series of presidential decrees) made the barangay the basic political unit of Philippines. The Centro, as it used to known, was then split into Upper Jasaan and Lower Jasaan. Local residents would refer to these two as Ubos and Ibabaw, a vernacular indication of their geographical location in the slope: Ubos being Lower, and Ibabaw being Upper. Despite the partition of the Poblacion into two barangays, the old village identifications‚Äìthe Purok‚Äìare still generally referred to in the present Jasaan. Jasaan town plaza is a good example of the separation of church and state property. A road runs through the middle of the plaza, making the demarcation line. The portion fronting the centuries-old church belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, and on portion on the other side of the road is owned by the local government of Jasaan. Education The Jasaan Catholic School (later Mary Immaculate Academy, and recently Saint Mary's Academy of Jasaan) which has been in operation from the start of the 20th century until the mid-70s, experienced competition from Jasaan National High School. The former was established by the Jesuits and later turned over to the Religious of the Virgin Mary, while the latter is a government-operated secondary school. Schools of higher learning, like the Colegio de Santo Nino and Jasaan School of Midwifery and Jasaan Community College (later Don Mariano Marcos Polytechnic College of Jasaan and now Mindanao University of Science and Technology), were also established in Jasaan.

History  Laguindingan used to be called \\"Daligdigan\\" coined from the words \\"daligdig\\", meaning trickling water from Soloan Creek, and \\"digan\\", a buri plant, which was used by the early settlers as roofing and walling materials. The name later evolved into \\"Laguindingan\\" because it is easier to pronounce and has a melodious sound. The presence of an old Spanish port \\"Moog\\" at Punta Sulawan manifest the claim that before the settlers came to Laguindingan, the place was the hideout of robbers, pirates and bandoleros because of the once thick forest cover of the municipality. A brave man named Calixto Caseres together with his family moved in from Alubijid and settled for good. Other settlers followed and soon the place became a thriving community.

Sambulawan derived from the word \\"Sulawan\\" because the place is situated on a hill or in Bisaya \\"ilaya\\" going up where the sun rises its bright lights is glaring to the eye, thus \\"Sulaw\\" in bisaya.

History Long before the Spanish colonization, the place was originally named \\"Bongloy\\" by the natives called the Magahats, because of the three gigantic Bongloy trees that grew in the place where the Catholic church and town plaza stands today. In 1830, the mission of Jasaan, an adjacent town to the north, was to establish separation from Cagayan de Oro and evangelization to as far as the towns of Sumilao, Linabo and Malitbog in the province of Bukidnon. Its center of civilization and the first Church was at \\"Daanglungsod\\" which is now the Aplaya, Jasaan, where an old kota (watchtower) still exists, thus marked the birth of Christianity in Bongloy. Father Gregorio Parache, S.J., - (432 local historical sources of Northern Mindanao by Father Francisco Demetrio, S. J), who was the parish priest of Jasaan at that time brought a certain Captain Villanueva to Bongloy. Villanueva was a Mexican-American soldier who was one of the occupants of Balingasag Convent during the American occupation of the Philippines. Father Parache requested Captain Villanueva to assist him in the plans and then commissioned the captain to develop a potable water and irrigation system in the Bongloy area. As the years passed, the Magahats moved eastward below the town of Claveria and began calling Bongloy as Villanueva in honor of the captain. The word Villanueva was handed down through word of mouth in the succeeding generations.

Owned by Charter Communications, it currently serves the Tampa Bay area including Hillsborough, Pinellas, Manatee, Polk, Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus counties. The station, which is exclusive to Spectrum customers, provides rolling news programming 24 hours a day, with the exception of some special programming, including a weekly political program, Political Connections. The station was created by Elliott Wiser, who was hired as General Manager by Time Warner Cable in May 1997. At that time Time Warner was building a similar news channel in Orlando. Wiser later created Bay News 9 en Espa√±ol, Tampa Bay on Demand, and Spectrum Sports. History The station began operating on September 24, 1997 and gives weather updates every 10 minutes \\"on the nines\\" and more frequently during serious weather conditions. In 2002, Bay News 9 was the first TV station in the area to provide a VIPIR Doppler radar system. In 2007, Bay News 9 became the first station in Florida, and one of only a handful of stations, to provide a Dual-Pole Doppler Radar system. On Monday, January 5, 2009, Bay News 9 launched its upgraded doppler radar system called Klystron 9. This new system is capable of seeing weather features in greater detail than other Doppler radar systems. Klystron 9 combines, for the first time in history, a dual Polarimetry radar, Klystron tube, Pulse compression technology and a 1.25-million watt transmitter. That combination of technology makes Klystron 9 the most powerful television radar in the world. Klystron 9 has the ability to see storms other radars can't see and see deeper into those storms. The Klystron 9's dual-pole technology even tells meteorologists the sizes and shape of raindrops and makes the distinction between rain and ice. Two original anchors remain with the station: meteorologists Mike Clay and Alan Winfield. Winfield only works during hurricanes after leaving the station full-time in 2006 to join a religious ministry. In December 2008, Jen Holloway left the station to join the parent company, Bright House Networks, as a marketing spokesperson. Weekend morning anchor Erica Riggins replaced her spot. Bay News 9 was originally seen on channel 9 on all systems, except for Pasco County, where it was seen on channel 6. On August 7, 2013, Bright House Networks moved Bay News 9 to channel 9 in Pasco County, making Bay News 9 available on all of Bright House's cable systems in the Tampa Bay area. The newscasts (with the exception of Your Morning News) are recorded for repeat broadcasts with breaking news and weather forecasts inserted almost hourly. News operation Bay News 9 maintains content partnerships with several local radio stations as well as various Bay Area newspapers including the Tampa Bay Business Journal, the Citrus County Chronicle, and The Bradenton Herald. The channel also operates news bureaus in Tampa, Bradenton, New Port Richey and Spring Hill; as well as at the offices of the Citrus County Chronicle in Crystal River and The Ledger in Lakeland. The channel also produces feature reports for Orlando-based sister channel News 13 (Bright House began carrying that channel in the Tampa market on digital channel 1213 in December 2010, with Bay News 9 conversely being added to the provider's Central Florida systems on digital channel 1209Per Zap2it, zip code 32809.). In 1999, Bay News 9 introduced \\"Health Team 9,\\" a team of practicing doctors (Steven Seltzer, Robert DiMasi, Jacentha Buggs and Linda McClintock) and a licensed psychologist (Steve O'Brien) employed by the channel to serve as experts reporting on a variety of medical issues. The channel ran a regular medical news segment during the morning newscast called \\"Health Team 9 Health Watch\\", as well as a segment during the primetime newscast called \\"Health Team 9 Medical Beat\\" (which was conducted by the anchor of that night's broadcast). In June 2011, the \\"Medical Beat\\" segment was replaced with \\"Priority Health,\\" in which Dr. Randy Shuck answers health questions sent in by viewers via email; the \\"Health Watch\\" segment was also replaced with \\"Health Headlines,\\" focusing on the day's medical news headlines. Dr. Steve O'Brien remains with Bay News 9 as its mental health expert. =Programming= The channel operates on a news \\"wheel\\" format, offering blocks of news segments, weather forecasts and feature reports in regular intervals; regular weather segments are broadcast in 10-minute intervals \\"on the nines,\\" with more frequent updates during severe weather events and wall-to-wall coverage whenever hurricanes or tropical storms affect the channel's service area. Its programming is presented live, although a digital video \\"jukebox\\" is used to recycle segments (except for those aired during Your Morning News block) for broadcast at other times and to provide loops of newscasts originally broadcast live in certain timeslots (particularly during the overnight hours). Producers update the wheel throughout the day, inserting new material as stories are filed and updated information becomes available; coverage of breaking news events are also inserted as warranted. In March 2008, Bay News 9 revamped its news cycle, eliminating the \\"Beyond the Bay\\" segment at 42 minutes past the hour and replacing it with the Extra segment that aired at 23 minutes past the hour, which was in turn replaced by local news segments. In recent years, traffic segments on weekends have also been eliminated to allow for additional local news coverage. The format returns to the \\"original\\" news cycle, with \\"Extra\\" segments appearing at 23 and 53 minutes past the hour during the primetime and overnight newscasts. Bay News 9 also is an affiliate of the national and international video news service CNN Newsource. In addition, Bay News 9 produces the half-hour political discussion program Political Connections (airing Sundays at 11:00 a.m., with an encore at 8:00 p.m.); the program, which is currently hosted by weekday afternoon anchor Al Ruechel debuted in 2005 as part of a partnership between Bay News 9 and the Tampa Bay Times. Upon the channel's launch, Bay News 9 began producing the nightly half-hour sports highlight program Toyota Sports Connection (it originally aired at 10:30 p.m., before moving to 11:00 p.m. in 2001), which focused mainly on local sports as well as major national sports headlines. It was originally hosted by former Tampa Bay Buccaneer defensive lineman David Logan until his death in 1999, with Rock Riley assuming hosting duties thereafter (the channel has since begun awarding a scholarship to high school athletes named in Logan's honor, The David Logan Scholarship). The program was moved to Bright House Sports Network (now known as Spectrum Sports) in 2010, retaining its 11:00 p.m. timeslot (the regional sports network repeats the program throughout the following day after the initial broadcast). =Community service= Bay News 9 maintains a program, \\"Project Weather,\\" which tours hurricane expos and schools in Tampa Bay area communities providing weather safety information to area students. They do SKYPE sessions with local schools called Weather Wednesdays, where students can SKYPE with a meteorologist. The channel distributes science kits to all 6th grade public school teachers in the channel's seven-county viewing area and \\"Project Weather Activity Books\\" for preschool and elementary school-aged children at community events. The channel also has an interactive exhibit called \\"Bay News 9 Rain or Shine\\" at the Glazer Children's Museum in Tampa, a news and weather exhibit at the Explorations V Children's Museum in Lakeland, a news and weather exhibit at Great Explorations Children's Museum in St. Petersburg, and an exhibit at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Clearwater. =Notable current personalities= Holly Gregory - anchor Mike Clay - chief meteorologist Josh Linker - meteorologist Chuck Henson - traffic anchor Affiliated channels =Bay News 9 HD= Bay News 9 HD is a high definition simulcast feed of Bay News 9 that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. The HD feed is carried on Charter Spectrum digital channels 1009 and 1209; it was launched in the spring of 2006, which resulted in the debut of an extensive graphical overhaul to Bay News 9. Newscasts airing on the feed were not originally produced in HD, airing instead in the 480i format (with stylized pillarboxing) and upconverted to 1080i. On October 20, 2011, Bay News 9 and sister network InfoM√°s began broadcasting their news programming in high definition, with programming being upgraded to the 16:9 aspect ratio and the introduction of a revised graphics package. =InfoM√°s= InfoM√°s was a well-received Spanish language regional news channel operated through a partnership between Bay News 9 and Orlando- based sister network News 13. The channel was the first 24-hour Spanish language regional news channel in the United States; in addition to providing normal rolling news coverage, the channel also carried exclusive stories tailored to Tampa's storied Hispanic and Latin American population. Originally carried on digital channel 139, Bay News 9 en Espa√±ol was later moved to Spectrum digital channel 900. In 2010, the channel began Spanish language game telecasts from the Tampa Bay Rays and Miami Marlins Major League Baseball, and Orlando Magic NBA franchises. The service originated as a separate 24-hour Spanish news channel focused solely on the Tampa Bay area called \\"Bay News 9 en Espa√±ol,\\". Created by Elliott Wiser, the channel launched in March 2002, becoming the country‚Äôs first local news channel in Spanish. On March 11, 2011, Bright House Networks announced that it would merge Bay News 9 and Central Florida News 13's respective Spanish-language news channels into a single regional channel, InfoM√°s. However, soon after Charter assumed control of the company, InfoM√°s was discontinued (despite popular demand) on November 20, 2017, due to most of the Hispanic population in the area watching Bay News 9's English coverage. The regional network was launched on July 12, 2011. =Spectrum Travel Weather Now= Spectrum Travel Weather Now was a 24-hour weather service, which broadcasts on Bright House digital channel 109 and on analog channel 2 (WCLF is digital-only). The channel was launched in 1999 as Bay News 9 Weather Now, and originally provided local forecasts 24 hours a day. In 2004, the channel was relaunched as Bay News 9 Travel Weather Now, reformatted as a 24-hour weather network geared primarily towards business travelers. In October 2009, Bright House Networks revised the channel's name to Bright House Networks Travel Weather Now, with on-air advertisements acknowledging that is content is provided by Bay News 9. After Bright House Networks became Charter Spectrum, Travel Weather Now has been replaced by TV Guide in the bottom screen and a simulcast of Bay News 9 on top. =Tampa Bay on Demand/Bay News 9 on Demand= Tampa Bay on Demand is a video on demand service which offers local entertainment programming, and is carried on Charter Spectrum digital channel 340. It features segments conducted by Bay News 9 reporter Virginia Johnson, which focuses on people and places within the Tampa Bay entertainment scene, as well as cooking segments (hosted by Roy DeJesus), restaurant and wine reviews, celebrity interviews, and holiday features. The wine review program, Vino Vino, hosted by Elliott Wiser, was nominated for a Cable FAX Award (an awards ceremony presented by industry trade publication Cable FAX) for \\"Best Video on Demand Program\\" in August 2012. Bay News 9 also operates a news-focused VOD service Bay News 9 on Demand, which features long-form news content such as press conferences. In popular culture =Film= The 2011 film Dolphin Tale and its 2014 sequel Dolphin Tale 2 featured scenes filmed at Bay News 9's St. Petersburg studio facility. Bay News 9 also operates a webcam in which visitors to the channel's website can watch Winter, the real-life dolphin whose rescue inspired the first film, from her home at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.

The navy during the Revolution At the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, the naval forces of the Greeks consisted primarily of the merchant fleet of the Saronic islanders from Hydra, Spetsai and Poros and also the islanders of Psara and Samos. The fleet was of crucial importance to the success of the revolt. Its goal was to prevent as much as possible the Ottoman Navy from resupplying the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire's Asian provinces. The destruction of the Turkish flagship at Chios by Kanaris Although Greek crews were experienced seamen, the light Greek ships, mostly armed merchantmen, were unable to stand up to the large Turkish ships of the line in direct combat. So the Greeks resorted to the use of fireships ( or ), with great success. It was in the use of such ships that courageous seamen like Constantine Kanaris won international renown. Under the leadership of capable admirals, most prominently Andreas Miaoulis of Hydra, the Greek fleet achieved early victories, guaranteeing the survival of the revolt in the mainland. However, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of Kasos and Psara in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at Modon despite victories at Samos and Gerontas. The Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the Battle of Navarino in 1827. There the Egypto-Ottoman fleet was decisively defeated by the combined fleets of the Britain, France and the Russian Empire, effectively securing the independence of Greece. When Ioannis Capodistrias became governor of newly liberated Greece, the Greek fleet consisted of few remaining ships, which had participated in the war for independence. The first minister of \\"Naval affairs\\" was Constantine Kanaris, and the most powerful ship of the fleet at that time, the frigate Hellas, had been constructed in the United States in 1825. The Navy established its headquarters at the island of Poros and the building of a new series of ships began at the naval base while old ships were gradually being retired. Furthermore, continuous efforts towards the education of officers were initiated. Young people were initially trained at the military school of Scholi Evelpidon and afterwards they were transferred to the navy, as there was no such thing as a Naval Academy.Official website of the Hellenic Navy In 1831, Greece descended into anarchy with numerous areas, including the Mani Peninsula and Hydra, in revolt. It was during this revolt that the flagship Hellas, docked at Poros, was set on fire by Admiral Andreas Miaoulis.Politics and Statecraft in the Kingdom of Greece, John Anthony Petropulos, Princeton University Press, 1968. Capodistrias was assassinated a few months after. The Royal Hellenic Navy of King Otto When the new King Otto arrived in the Greek capital, Nafplion, in 1832 aboard the British warship HMS Madagascar, the Greek fleet consisted of 1 corvette, 3 brigs, 6 gollettes, 2 gunboats, 2 steamboats and a few more small vessels. The first Naval School was founded in 1846 on the corvette Loudovikos and Leonidas Palaskas was assigned as its director. However the inefficient training of the officers, coupled with conflict between those who pursued modernization and those who were stalwarts of the traditions of the veterans of the struggle for independence, resulted in a restricted and inefficient navy, which was limited to policing the sea and the pursuit of pirates. During the 1850s, the more progressive elements of the navy won out and the fleet was augmented with more ships. In 1855, the first iron propeller-driven ships were ordered from England. These were the steamships Panopi, Pliksavra, Afroessa, and Sfendoni. Growth of the navy under King George During the 1866 Cretan revolt, the ships of the Royal Hellenic Navy were in no condition to support it. Such failure led to the government awakening to the problem of naval insufficiency and the adoption of a policy stating that: \\"The navy, as it represents a necessary weapon for Greece, should only be created for war and aim to victory.\\" Because of this, the fleet was supplied with new and bigger ships, reflecting a number of innovations including the use of iron in shipbuilding industry and the invention of the torpedo; with these advances, the effectiveness and the appearance of the Hellenic Navy changed. Meanwhile after 1878, because of the Russo-Turkish War and the need to expand the Greek navy, a new and larger naval base was established in the area of Faneromeni of Salamis and a few years later it was transferred to the area of Arapis where it remains today. At the same time the Naval Academy was founded and Ilias Kanellopoulos was made Director. In 1884, a French naval mission to Greece, headed by Admiral Lejeune, introduced a new, advanced naval organization and the methodological training of enlisted personnel through the establishment of a training school in the old building of the naval base in Poros. Battleship Psara During the government of Charilaos Trikoupis in 1889, the fleet was further increased with the acquisition of new battleships:Hydra, Spetsai, and Psara from France. Thus, when Greece went to war in the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, the Hellenic Navy established its dominance in the Aegean Sea; however, it was unable to change the outcome of the war on land, which was a national humiliation. In 1907, the Hellenic Navy General Staff (ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒïœÄŒπœÑŒµŒªŒµŒØŒø ŒùŒ±œÖœÑŒπŒ∫Œøœç) was founded, with then-Captain Pavlos Kountouriotis as its first head. After the war in 1897, the Ottoman Empire embarked on a program of naval expansion for its fleet and as a response to that, in 1909, the cruiser Georgios Averof was bought from Italy. In 1910, an English naval mission arrived, headed by Admiral Tuffnel, in order to recommend improvements in the organization and training of the navy. The mission led to the adoption of the English style of management, organization and training, especially in the area of strategy. World War I and after: 1914‚Äì1940 For a list of ships in the fleet in this era, see The Hellenic Navy in 1917 Greek battleship Lemnos at Constantinople in 1919 The Navy, shortly before the Balkan Wars, was composed of a destroyer and battleship fleet. Its mission was primarily offensive, aiming at capturing the Ottoman-held islands of the Eastern Aegean, and establish naval supremacy in the area. To that end, its commander-in-chief, Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, established a forward base at the Moudros bay at Lemnos, directly opposite the Dardanelles straits. After defeating the two Turkish sallies from the Straits at Elli (December 1912) and Lemnos (January 1913), the Aegean Sea was secured for Greece. The Balkan Wars were followed by a rapid escalation between Greece and the Ottoman Empire over the as yet unclear status of the islands of the Eastern Aegean. Both governments embarked on a naval armaments race, with Greece purchasing the obsolete battleships and and the light cruiser as well as ordering two dreadnoughts, and the and a number of destroyers. However, with the outbreak of the First World War, construction of the dreadnoughts stopped. Initially during the war, Greece followed a course of neutrality, with the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos favoring the Entente and pro-German King Constantine I advocating neutrality. This dispute eventually led to a deep political conflict, known as the \\"National Schism\\". In November 1916, in order to apply pressure on the royal government in Athens, the French confiscated the Greek ships (see Noemvriana). They continued to operate with French crews, primarily in convoy escort and patrol duties in the Aegean, until Greece entered the war on the side of the Allies in July 1917, at which point they were returned to Greece. Subsequently, the Greek Navy took part in the Allied operations in the Aegean, in the Allied expedition in support of Denikin's White Armies in the Ukraine, and in the operations of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922 in Asia Minor. After Greece's catastrophic defeat, the 1920s and early 1930s were a politically turbulent period, with the economy in a bad state, so the Navy received no new units, apart from the modernization of four destroyers and the acquisition of six French submarines in 1927 and four Italian destroyers in 1929. World War II In 1938, Greece ordered four modern Greyhound-class destroyers in English shipyards, making a serious step towards modernization. The outbreak of war in Europe, however, allowed only two to be delivered. Greece entered World War II with a weak navy consisting of ten destroyers, two outdated battleships, two light cruisers and six submarines. On the eve of the Italian invasion in 1940, the RHN consisted of 34 ships and 6,500 men.Contribution and Sacrifice of the Hellenic Navy and the Hellenic Merchant Marine in the Allied effort against the Axis during W.W. II, 1939-1945 , by Rear Adm Sotirios Georgiadis The Hellenic Navy suffered its first loss of the war on 15 August 1940 (two months before the formal outbreak of hostilities) when the cruiser Helli was sunk by the Italian submarine Delfino, possibly acting on Mussolini's orders. During the Greco-Italian War, the Navy took over convoy escort missions in the Aegean and the Ionian Sea and undertook three unsuccessful raids against the Italian supply convoys in the Strait of Otranto. The most important role was given to the submarines, which although obsolete, sank some Italian cargo ships in the Adriatic, losing one submarine in the process. The Greek submarine force (six boats) was however too small to be able to seriously hinder the supply lines between Italy and Albania (between 28 October 1940 and 30 April 1941, Italian ships made 3,305 voyages across the Otranto straits, carrying 487,089 military personnel, including 22 field divisions, and 584,392 tons of supplies while losing overall only seven merchant ships and one escort ship).Pier Filippo Lupinacci, Vittorio Emanuele Tognelli, La difesa del traffico con l'Albania, la Grecia e l'Egeo, Ufficio Storico della Marina Militare, Rome 1965, pp. 47-49. When Nazi Germany attacked Greece, the RHN was decimated by the Luftwaffe, suffered the loss of 25 ships within a few days during April 1941. It was then decided to shift the remaining fleet (one cruiser -the famous -, six destroyers, five submarines, three torpedo boats and a number of auxiliary vessels) to Alexandria in Egypt. Here the ships were repaired and equipped with modern anti-aircraft weapons. For the remainder of the war, the RHN fought alongside the Allies from bases in the Middle East. As the war progressed, the number of Hellenic Royal Navy vessels increased after the concession of several destroyers and submarines by the British Royal Navy, reaching a peak of 44 ships and 8,500 men in early 1944. The most notable aspects of the Hellenic Royal Navy's participation in World War II include the operations of the destroyer which, until sunk in Leros on September 23, 1943, was the most successful Allied destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea; the participation of two destroyers in Operation Overlord; and the story of the destroyer Adrias, which while operating close to the coast of Kalymnos in October 1943 hit a mine, resulting in the loss of the vessel's prow, while blowing the two-gun forward turret over the bridge. After some minor repairs at G√ºm√º≈ül√ºk Bay in Turkey Adrias managed to return to Alexandria in a 400-mile trip, even though all the forepart of the ship, up to the bridge, was missing. Six Greek warships participated in the Sicilian landings and in the subsequent Italian campaign. In April, 1944, a mutiny arising from political causes broke out on five Greek warships berthed in Alexandria and spread to a number of other Greek naval and merchant vessels. It was put down by Greek Marines, who suffered 50 casualties.Andrew Mollo, page 142 \\"The Armed Forces of World War II\\", Modern Era 1950-1990 After World War II, the Royal Hellenic Navy was significantly strengthened by the concession of British and Italian ships. The organisation also changed in line with modern naval doctrines of that era, leaving aside the old battleships after the entrance into NATO in 1952. At the beginning of the 1950s, US military aid formed the core of the country's armed forces. The Royal Hellenic Navy received the first Bostwick-class destroyers which took on the name Beasts (ŒòŒ∑œÅŒØŒ±), while withdrawing the British ones. The next significant change was during the early 1970s, when Greece was the first Mediterranean naval force to order missile-equipped fast attack craft (La Combattante II) and the Type 209 submarines, whereas US military aid continued in the form of FRAM II type destroyers. In 1979, Hellenic Navy placed an order in the Netherlands for two modern Standard-class frigates (the ). These were the first acquisitions of new main surface vessels, rather than the use of second- hand ships, in almost four decades. Present Hellenic Navy was enhanced to his maximum point during the last decade. The arrivals of the Hydra class (MEKO 200 HN) and more Standard-class frigates along with the orders for more missile corvettes, Poseidon-class (Type 209) submarines and naval helicopters allowed the retirement of the obsolete vessels. At the same time, Greece was the first Mediterranean country to receive guided missile destroyers, after the transfer of four s from the US Navy in 1992. But all four have since been decommissioned, since their electronics and missiles were considered not able to stand in a modern battlefield.

He served in the United States Senate from 1885 to 1891 and from 1897 to 1907. A Republican, by the 1890s, he was one of the \\"Big Four\\" key Republicans who largely controlled the major decisions of the Senate, along with Orville H. Platt of Connecticut, William B. Allison of Iowa and Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island. Early life Portrait of John Coit Spooner, in 1899. Spooner was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana on January 6, 1843, the son of Philip Loring Spooner and Lydia (Coit) Spooner. Philip Spooner was an attorney and judge and served on the bench in both Indiana and Wisconsin. Spooner moved with his parents to Madison, Wisconsin, in 1859. He attended the common schools and graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a Bachelor of Philosophy (Philosophiae Baccalaureus, or P.B.) degree in 1864. While in college, Spooner joined the Psi Upsilon fraternity and was admitted to membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Military service During the Civil War, he enlisted in the Union Army as a private assigned to Company D, 40th Wisconsin Infantry, a three-month unit. After Spooner's 100 days of service were complete, he returned home and recruited a company from his college classmates, Company A, 50th Wisconsin Infantry, which he commanded as a captain. At the close of the war, Spooner received a brevet promotion to major. Start of career After the war, Spooner served as private secretary to Wisconsin Governor Lucius Fairchild, and then the governor's military secretary with the rank of colonel He later served as quartermaster general of the Wisconsin Militia with the rank of brigadier general. He studied law with his father from 1865 to 1867, and he was admitted to the bar in 1867. After becoming a lawyer, Spooner was appointed assistant attorney general of Wisconsin and he served from 1869 to 1870. In 1869, Spooner received the honorary degree of Master of Arts from the University of Wisconsin. Spooner moved to Hudson in 1870, and practiced law there from 1870 to 1884. He established himself in the field of railroad and corporation law, and served as counsel for the West Wisconsin Railway and Chicago, St. Paul and Minneapolis Railway. Spooner was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1872. He was a member of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents from 1882 to 1886. United States Senator He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate January 27, 1885, and served from 1885 to 1891, being defeated for re-election by William F. Vilas. He served as chairman of the Committee on Claims from 1886 to 1891. In 1888 and again in 1892, Spooner was a delegate to the Republican National Convention and was the chairman of Wisconsin's delegation. Spooner was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for governor of Wisconsin in 1892. After his election defeat, he moved to Madison and resumed practicing law in 1893. In 1897, Spooner was elected to the U.S. Senate, succeeding Vilas. He was reelected in 1903, and served from 1897 until his resignation in 1907. He served as chairman of the Committee on Canadian Relations from 1897 to 1899 and of the Committee on Rules from 1899 to 1907. As a Senator, Spooner was credited with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 provision that enabled the government to prosecute Standard Oil. He also promoted the legislation which created a civil government for the Philippines following the Spanish-American War. He was the author of the Spooner Act, which gave President Theodore Roosevelt authority to purchase the Panama Canal Zone. A popular figure among Republicans, he turned down three cabinet posts during his political career: Secretary of the Interior in President William McKinley's administration in 1898, Attorney General under President McKinley in 1901, and Secretary of State in President William Howard Taft's administration in 1909. Spooner and fellow Wisconsin Senator, Robert M. La Follette, were known to be bitter rivals. Spooner disagreed with La Follette's progressive policies, which were opposed to his own conservative policies. Spooner was also one of the early opponents of direct primary elections. At the time, party nominees were selected by the party officials, sometimes by party bosses. Spooner's view of political campaigns if direct primaries became standard was: > Direct primaries would destroy the party machinery ... and would build up a > lot of personal machines, and would make every man a self-seeker, and would > degrade politics by turning candidacies into bitter personal > wrangles.Eigen's Political & Historical Quotations Later life After his retirement from the Senate, he practiced law in New York City. In 1910, Spooner and Joseph P. Cotton formed the firm of Spooner & Cotton, where Spooner practiced until his death until his death. Death and burial Spooner died on June 11, 1919 at his home in Manhattan following a nervous breakdown. He was interred in Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin. Awards and honors Spooner received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1894. He also received honorary LL.D. degrees from Yale University in 1908 and Columbia University (1909). Family In 1868, Spooner married Annie Main of Madison. They were the parents of four children, three of whom lived to adulthood -- Charles Philip Spooner (1869-1947), Willet Main Spooner (1871-1928), John C. Spooner (1877-1881), and Philip Loring Spooner (1879-1945).

In some countries, denatured alcohol or denatured rectified spirit may commonly be available as \\"rectified spirit\\". In its undiluted form, it contains at least 55% alcohol by volume (ABV) (110 US proof) in the European Union. The purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 95% ABV (95.6% by mass) when produced using conventional distillation processes, as a mixture of ethanol and water becomes a minimum- boiling azeotrope at this concentration. Rectified spirit is typically distilled in continuous multi-column stills at 96‚Äì96.5% ABV and diluted as necessary. Neutral spirits can be produced from grains, corn, grapes, sugar beets, sugarcane, tubers, or other fermented plant materials. In particular, large quantities of neutral alcohol are distilled from wine. A product made from grain is \\"grain neutral spirit\\", while a spirit made from grapes is called \\"grape neutral spirit\\" or \\"vinous alcohol\\". These terms are commonly abbreviated as either GNS or NGS. Neutral spirits are used in the production of blended whisky, cut brandy, some liqueurs, and some bitters. As a consumer product, it is almost always mixed with other beverages to create drinks like alcoholic punch or Jello shots or is sometimes added to cocktails in place of vodka or rum. It is also used to make homemade liqueurs, such as limoncello or cassis, and in cooking because its high concentration of alcohol acts as a solvent to extract flavors. Rectified spirits are also used for medicinal tinctures and as a household solvent. It is sometimes consumed undiluted; however because the alcohol is very high proof, overconsumption can cause alcohol poisoning more quickly than more traditional distilled spirits.  Regional  =Poland= Spirytus Rektyfikowany made by Polmos is the iconic brand with 95% ABV. = United States = Neutral spirit is legally defined as spirit distilled from any material distilled at or above 95% ABV (190 US proof) and bottled at or above 40% ABV. When the term is used in an informal context rather than as a term of U.S. law, any distilled spirit of high alcohol purity (e.g., 170 proof or higher) that does not contain added flavoring may be referred to as neutral alcohol.Lichine, Alexis. Alexis Lichine's New Encyclopedia of Wines & Spirits (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1987), 365. Prominent brands of neutral spirits sold in the U.S. include: * Brands made by Luxco: ** Everclear ** Crystal Clear ** Golden Grain * Gem Clear \\"Grain spirit\\" is a legal classification for neutral spirit that is distilled from fermented grain mash and stored in oak containers.  Retail availability  Availability of neutral spirit for retail purchase varies between states. States where consumer sales of high-ABV neutral spirit are prohibited include California, Florida,2009 Florida Statutes, Title XXXIV Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and West Virginia. In Virginia, the purchase of neutral spirits requires a no-cost \\"Grain Alcohol Permit\\", issued \\"strictly for industrial, commercial, culinary or medicinal use\\". In 2017, Virginia approved the sale of up to 151 proof neutral spirits at its ABC stores without a permit. Pennsylvania sells 151 proof without a permit but requires one for 190 proof. = Canada = Global 94 %, a 94% ABV rectified spirit, is available in Quebec through SAQ. = Germany = In Germany, rectified spirit is generically called Primasprit (colloquial) or, more technically, Neutralalkohol. It is available in pharmacies, bigger supermarkets, and East European markets. In the former East Germany, it was available in regular stores. Primasprit is most often used for making homemade liqueurs; other types of use are rare. Most of the Primasprit produced in Germany is made from grain and is, therefore, a neutral grain spirit. = Norway = The import and sale of spirits containing more than 60% alcohol by volume is prohibited, so only weaker grain spirits are permitted. Moonshine Moonshine is usually distilled to 40% ABV, and seldom above 66% based on 48 samples. However, ethanol can be dried to 95% ABV (rectified spirit) with a column of 3A molecular sieves.

This white or colourless crystalline salt is noteworthy for its high solubility in many solvents. It exists both in anhydrous form and as a trihydrate. Applications =Inorganic chemistry= Lithium perchlorate is used as a source of oxygen in some chemical oxygen generators. It decomposes at about 400 ¬∞C, yielding lithium chloride and oxygen: :LiClO4 ‚Üí LiCl + 2 O2 Over 60% of the mass of the lithium perchlorate is released as oxygen. It has both the highest oxygen to weight and oxygen to volume ratio of all practical perchlorate salts. =Organic chemistry= LiClO4 is highly soluble in organic solvents, even diethyl ether. Such solutions are employed in Diels-Alder reactions, where it is proposed that the Lewis acidic Li+ binds to Lewis basic sites on the dienophile, thereby accelerating the reaction.Charette, A.

Lithium perchlorate is also used as a co-catalyst in the coupling of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyls with aldehydes, also known as the Baylis-Hillman reaction. Lithium Perchlorate Product Detail Page Solid lithium perchlorate is found to be a mild and efficient Lewis acid for promoting cyanosilylation of carbonyl compounds under neutral conditions. =Batteries= Lithium perchlorate is also used as an electrolyte salt in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium perchlorate is chosen over alternative salts such as lithium hexafluorophosphate or lithium tetrafluoroborate when its superior electrical impedance, conductivity, hygroscopicity, and anodic stability properties are of importance to the specific application. However, these beneficial properties are often overshadowed by the electrolyte's strong oxidizing properties, making the electrolyte reactive toward its solvent at high temperatures and/or high current loads. Due to these hazards the battery is often considered unfit for industrial applications. =Biochemistry= Concentrated solutions of lithium perchlorate (4.5 mol/L) are used as a chaotropic agent to denature proteins. Production Lithium perchlorate can be manufactured by reaction of sodium perchlorate with lithium chloride. It can be also prepared by electrolysis of lithium chlorate at 200 mA/cm2 at temperatures above 20 ¬∞C.Helmut Vogt, Jan Balej, John E.

H. Dodd in New York. The work comprehensively records and documents key events of the city's chronology from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. Among other things, it shows the evolution of the Manhattan skyline up to the time of publication. Description Stokes's worldwide research teams scoured public and private collections of maps, guides and obscure source material to complete his encyclopedic monument to New York City. It describes in detail the growth of a fortified Dutch settlement into a major city, and ultimately included six volumes sold to subscribers and libraries in a limited edition of 360 sets printed on Holland-made paper and 42 on Japanese vellum. The book itself states the paper used for printing the book was of English origin and not from Holland. The Iconography‚Äôs many writers lead the reader through picaresque stories about the humble as well as praising major figures. Source material included accounts from ledgers, accounting books and scraps of paper that the author said had been strewn about in unorganized piles from the floors of far flung academies and international halls of records. Much of this primary source material has been lost to time or destroyed by war. In the rare first edition, there is a one page apology made by Stokes to subscribers of the rare set of works indicating where paper stock was - by necessity of shortage - changed from the original supplier's high grade Holland paper to similar high grade stock due to the exigency of the Great War. Stokes I. N. Phelps Stokes was the scion of a progressive, wealthy turn-of-the century New York family. Leaving Harvard University with a desire to reform housing for the poor, Stokes' first contribution included model housing built not far from the \\"Five Points\\" neighborhood of Lower Manhattan: a breeding ground of crime due to over-crowded housing, poverty and disease. His insights into better housing for New York's poor enabled better living conditions through improved sanitation brought by modern building methods, and were shared by reformers such as Jacob Riis, Stanton Coit, Charles B. Stover and Carl Schurz. Stokes' work led to the New York Tenement Housing Law of 1901. Stokes's three other lasting monuments include St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University; 953 Fifth Avenue ‚Äì an Italian Renaissance palazzo-style fourteen story apartment building occupying the west side of Fifth Avenue near 76th Street; and 184 Eldridge Street, also by the firm of Stokes and John Mead Howells, which has housed the University Settlement Society of New York since 1898, and is now a landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Stokes's bad real estate investments bankrupted him long after his monumental publishing effort left him in dire straits. Stokes spent his later years working as prints curator at the New York Public Library, specializing in city views. References Notes Further reading * External links * I.N.

This white solid forms a monohydrate and is mildly deliquescent. It is a useful source of the Ag+ ion, although the presence of perchlorate presents risks. It is used as a catalyst in organic chemistry. Production Silver perchlorate is created by heating a mixture of perchloric acid with silver nitrate. Alternatively, it can be prepared by the reaction between barium perchlorate and silver sulfate, or from the reaction of perchloric acid with silver oxide. Solubility Silver perchlorate is noteworthy for its solubility in aromatic solvents such as benzene (52.8 g/L) and toluene (1010 g/L). In these solvents, the silver cation binds to the arene, as has been demonstrated by extensive crystallographic studies on crystals obtained from such solutions. Its solubility in water is extremely high, up to 500 g per 100 mL water. Related reagents Similar to silver nitrate, silver perchlorate is an effective reagent for replacing halides ligands with perchlorate, which is a weakly or non-coordinating anion. The use of silver perchlorate in chemical synthesis has declined due to concerns about explosiveness of perchlorate salts.

Subongwati Ningdangri Ao and his wife Maongsangla Changkilari, in the village of Changki, in the then Naga Hills District of Assam. He was the fourth of twelve children. Perhaps one of the most famous Nagas, he was a figurehead of India's football history, and his name is resonant in the collective memory of the people. Football career =Mohun Bagan= In 1943 Ao joined Mohun Bagan, who were then in the Calcutta Football League. He captained the Maroon and Green in 1948 and 1949, taking over from Sarat Das. Sarat Das was Ao's senior in Cotton College, Guwahati, and both of them had played for the Maharana Club of Guwahati. Ao was a striker in the Maharana Club but on joining Mohun Bagan he was positioned in the defense. In Mohun Bagan, Ao was Centre-Half and along with his two Backs, they were popularly known as \\"the Great Wall of China\\". He was given the captain's armband in 1948 to captain the Indian Football Team in London. In 1950 Ao captained Bagan in the Durand Cup but lost to Hyderabad Police in the final 1‚Äì0. Ao told his son that in this Durand Cup (1950) the Mohun Bagan goalkeeper was injured and that he took over in his place. =International career= In 1948, a year after India won its independence, Ao was the captain of the India national football team in the 1948 Summer Olympics, in the team's first official game and was the flag- bearer of the Indian contingent. The Indian team's first match was against Burma, but the game was a walkover. In India's second match, against France, the team lost 2‚Äì1, with the India goal coming from Sarangapani Raman. Ao played five more matches for India before retiring. Later life Ao studied medicine at R.G.Kar Medical College, Kolkata,West Bengal. He earned his MBBS, and in 1963 he returned to Nagaland where he was given the post of Assistant Civil Surgeon. He later became Civil Surgeon. He went on to be appointed Director of Nagaland Health Services, from which he retired in 1978. In 2002 the Mohun Bagan honored him by creating the Mohun Bagan Ratna Award and giving him a Life Membership. In Assam, an outdoor stadium at Kaliabor and an indoor stadium at Cotton College have been named after him. In 2009, Union Minister for Mines and DoNER, B.K Handique, inaugurated the first Dr. T. Ao Football Trophy at the DDSC Stadium in Dimapur, Nagaland, to encourage and challenge the North-East Youth to excel in both sports and academics. Death Early in 1998 Ao contracted seasonal influenza. Being already fragile of health and a diabetic, it led to further complications and deterioration. He was transported from Dimapur to Kohima, hospitalized and finally died in the Naga Civil Hospital, where he first served as Civil Surgeon in the early 1960s. He wished to be and was buried in the Naga Cemetery, Khermahal, Dimapur. He had two sons, two daughters and eight grandchildren.

They are considered a tool for visual merchandising. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a planogram \\"is a diagram or model that indicates the placement of retail products on shelves in order to maximize sales.\\" The effectiveness of the planogram can be measured by the sales volume generated from the specific area being diagramed. Overview Planograms are predominantly used in retail businesses. A planogram defines the location and quantity of products to be placed on display. The rules and theories for creating planograms are set under the terms of merchandising. For example, given limited shelf space, a vendor may prefer to provide a wide assortment of products, or may limit the assortment but increase the facings of each product to avoid stock-outs. Manufacturers often send planograms to stores ahead of new product shipments. This is useful when a vendor wants retail displays in multiple store locations to have the same look and feel. Often, a consumer goods manufacturer releases a planogram with each new product to show how the product can relate to existing products. Fast-moving consumer goods organizations and supermarkets mostly use text and box-based planograms to optimize shelf space, inventory turns and profit margins. Apparel brands and retailers are more focused on presentation and use pictorial planograms that illustrate the look and brand identity for each product. Placement methods =Visual= Visual product placement is supported by different theories including; horizontal, vertical, and block placement. Horizontal product placement increases the concentration of a certain article. Research studies suggest that a product's relation to customer eye levels directly correlates to its sales. This depends on the customer's distance from the unit. Vertical product placement puts products on more than one shelf level to achieve ‚Äì of placement space. Similar products are placed in blocks. A planogram can be compared to a book. A store is the book and its individual modules represent the pages. The customer gradually ‚Äúreads‚Äù individual modules and automatically proceeds from the left to the right, from the top to the bottom as if he/she read a book. This principle is followed by a majority of rules for goods displaying. The rules say that goods should be arranged on a shelf from the least to the most expensive ones. Goods may also be arranged in the reverse order, depending on the kind of goods that the dealer wishes to promote. This makes the difference between dealers of cheap and luxury goods. =Commercial= Commercial placement is determined by both market share placement and margin placement. Market share research companies like ACNielsen collect sales data for various products and calculate market share of products in various market segments. Margin placement is determined by the profit margin of a specific item. Higher margin places a product closer to the front of the store, where it is most likely to attract attention. =Derivative objectives= * To communicate how to set the merchandise * To ensure sufficient inventory levels on the shelf or display * To use space effectively (e.g. floor, page, and screen) * To facilitate communication of retailer's brand identity * To assist in the process of mapping a store * To improve customer satisfaction by shelves that are organized and visually-appealing Creation The planogram concept originated with KMart. Planograms are created with the help of planogramming software by a Planogram Specialist, Space Planning Specialist or Space Planning Manager. The retail industry utilizes software to ensure proper stocking. Retailers turn to planogram software to reflect each store‚Äôs particular customer profile and localized demand, while maintaining centralized control and supply chain efficiency. For example, some software packages focused upon fast-moving consumer goods and hard goods sectors made enhancements to transfer parts of shelving elements to single store measurements, which, according to the producers, should increase efficiency. Retailers automate the creation of store-specific planograms through use of corporate-level business rules and constraints describing best practices. Such planogramming solutions allow these companies to respond with location and language-specific messaging, pricing, and product placements based on business rules derived from location, campaign and fixture attributes to create localized assortments. Recent advances in store virtualization and collaboration allow manufacturers, retailers and category management experts from across the globe to work in the same virtual store in real time.

Krauth reports that it is situated at . According to a statement of the International Hydrographic Bureau (February 9, 1957), it \\"was reported in 1902 by the captain of the French ship the Ernest‚ÄëLegouv√©. The reef was about 100 meters long and another reef was sighted near it.\\" It was recorded the same year in the \\"Paris Notice to Mariners 164/1122/1902.\\" While it is absent from the 1859 Admiralty Chart, it is unclear if the 1902 sighting is the very first one by the Ernest‚ÄëLegouv√© or another ship bearing that name. It was searched for in 1982 and 1983 but not found, leading to it being considered a phantom island. Nevertheless, it is marked in the 2015 edition of the National Geographic Atlas of the World. Other nearby historically reported reefs which appear to not exist include Wachusett Reef, Jupiter Reef and Maria Theresa Reef (also known as Tabor Island, appearing in Jules Verne's In Search of the Castaways and The Mysterious Island). In its location and description, the Ernest Legouve Reef could be considered the real-life approximation of the remains of the fictional \\"Lincoln Island\\" of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island. The novel places the island, before its explosion, very close by, at . After its explosion, it is described ‚Äì in the Sidney Kravitz translation ‚Äì as \\"An isolated rock, thirty feet long, fifteen wide, emerging barely ten feet above the water.\\" The formation is referred to as a \\"reef\\" four times after its explosion. Interestingly, the character, Cyrus Smith, says with surprise after his fellow colonists and he are rescued, \\"This island isn't even marked on the maps!\\" But, since their rescue, \\"this reef [will] henceforth figure on the maps of the Pacific.\\" If Verne is referring to real maps or current sightings, these would be as of 1873-1874. The reef may also resemble the islet that the castaways first land on, about a half mile off of the coast of Lincoln Island. Verne describes it as \\"a tiny islet that did not measure more than two miles in length and much less in width.\\" The islet \\"occupied a narrow strip of the sea and, although larger in scale, resembled the body of an enormous whale. Its width even at its greatest point was not more than a quarter of a mile.\\" And since it was only separated from Lincoln Island by a narrow channel, it could easily be conflated for Lincoln Island itself in its coordinates. In Verne's, Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea, the main characters spend a couple of days on a so-called \\"Gueboroar Island\\" (possibly Gabba Island, or Golboa), which contains many similarities with the fictional Mysterious Island. Further association between fact and fiction comes from Vernian scholar, William Butcher. He explains that the real-life man, Ernest Legouv√© (1807-1903), \\"was a friend of Verne's who promised to help satisfy his cherished ambition of joining the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise\\" and so \\"there may be a hidden connection somewhere\\" (xxiv). While we know Ernest Legouve Reef is absent from the 1859 Admiralty Chart, it is unknown if the supposed 1902 sighting of this island/islet/reef by the ship named after Verne's friend is the very first claimed sighting after 1859. Butcher writes at length about how meticulously researched The Mysterious Island is. If the same ship, or another Ernest-Legouv√© vessel, had also sighted the reef before or around the time of Verne's writing (1873-1874), then Verne could be corroborating this sighting and putting his friend \\"on the map,\\" by using the reef's coordinates and description in the novel, in exchange for access to the Acad√©mie. It would be a strange coincidence indeed for a reef to be discovered by a ship named after Verne's friend at coordinates that Verne wrote into a novel 30 years before the discovery, and there not be some connection. As Butcher concludes: \\"Just as the missing day in Around the World emerges in the most surprising places, so the Mystery of the Island is a wide-ranging one.\\" References Category:Phantom islands Category:Reefs of the Pacific Ocean Category:Jules Verne  Notes  * Legouv√© also happened to be a fellow contributor to the French Magazine, Le Magasin d'√©ducation et de r√©cr√©ation, during the same year in which it first published Verne's, The Mysterious Island, in installments (i.e. 1874-1875)(Butcher, \\"Inception of the novel,\\" xliii) ","title":"Ernest Legouve Reef"},{"id":"2172197","text":"Time War can refer to: * Temporal war, a fictional conflict that takes place in multiple time periods, instigated by factions in the future who then travel back and alter history to their own ends *Time War (Doctor Who), an event in the fictional Doctor Who universe *Time War, a module in the Nintendo game Meteos *Time War, a fantasy novel by Lin Carter, published in 1974 *Time War (board game), a time travel wargame published in 1979 by Yaquinto See also * Temporal Cold War, in the Star Trek universe ","title":"Time War"},{"id":"2172198","text":"Maria Theresa Reef as \\"Maria Theresia Felsen\\" on 1904 German map of Antarctica Historic Antarctic map of 1906 with \\"Maria Theresia Rock?\\" The Maria Theresa Reef is a supposed reef in the South Pacific (south of the French Tuamotu islands and east of New Zealand); it appears to be a phantom reef. It is also known as Tabor Island or Tabor Reef on French maps. Reports Bernhard Krauth explains that Tabor/Maria Theresa's existence was reported in three contemporary newspapers as a dangerous reef seen on 16 November 1843 by a Captain Asaph P. Taber (not \\"Tabor\\") of the Maria-Theresa, a New Bedford, Massachusetts, whaler, to be situated at , later adjusted to . According to Krauth, who makes, however, several mistakes, the logbook of the Maria Theresa may read \\"Saw breakers.\\" This means that the Captain recorded simply that he saw \\"breakers,\\" which are sections of reef against which waves break, thus signaling that an island or system of reefs is near. Krauth further claims that Tabor would be in French waters if it existed. Jean-Paul Faivre reports that map no. 5356 of the (French) Naval Hydrographic Office and the folding map in \\"Malte-Brun revised by E. Cortambert, vol. 4\\" (without further reference) both mark \\"Maria-Theresa,\\" apparently 153 degrees W of Greenwich, and that no. 5356 also marks Ernest Legouve Reef. Hugh Cassidy, discussing his escapades, claims that \\"A nautical chart... issued by the W. Faden Company, Oceanographers to the King [George III], in 1817 lists Maria Theresa.\\" The shoal also apparently appears in US Hydrographic Office chart no. 2683 (1978), together with others in the vicinity. Tabor was unsuccessfully searched for in 1957. New Zealand's HMNZS Tui made an extensive search of the area in the 1970s and found no shallows or islands. The depths in the region were shown to be 2,734 fathoms (5,000 m). In 1983, the position of the reef was recalculated at , more than 1,000 km further east, and searched for, but not found. Its existence is doubtful. In 1966 amateur radio journal \\"CQ\\" published a photo and description of Don Miller transmitting from what he claimed was Maria Teresa Reef. This has been since proven to be a hoax. Other nearby historically reported reefs which also may not exist are: Jupiter Reef, Wachusett Reef, and Ernest Legouve Reef (the supposed site of the fictional, \\"Lincoln Island\\" of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island). The historical sightings of these reefs were probably inspired by the supposed existence of Maria Theresa Reef. Even in the 21st century, some map and atlas publishers still show this fictitious group of reefs in the South Pacific. In fiction The island appears in Jules Verne's novels In Search of the Castaways and The Mysterious Island. It is also present in Verne's play, Captain Grant's Children, but under a different name. Tabor is replaced by the imaginary \\"Balker Isle of the southern seas, situated not far from Adelie Coast\\" : like Tabor, at 37 degrees South, but with the longitude moved to 165 degrees West.Information can be found in Pierre Terrasse, \\"Un Centenaire: Les Enfants du capitaine Grant au theater,\\" BSJV 49 (1979): 21-31. In In Search of the Castaways (The Children of Captain Grant), the island shelters Captain Grant and two of his crew. Its coordinates being half-erased in the help message found by the children, it takes them months to find the castaways, with the help of Lord Glenarvan on board of his yacht \\"Duncan\\". Its coordinates are eventually given as using the Paris meridian. At the end of the book, Ayrton, the renegade, is left in Grant's place to live among the beasts and regain his humanity. In The Mysterious Island, after they have settled on Lincoln Island, the heroes travel to Tabor island using a small ship, meet Ayrton, and bring him back to civilisation and rehabilitation. The same coordinates for Tabor Island are given here as in Castaways, except this time using the Greenwich meridian. The island is described, in the Sidney Kravitz translation, as having a low coast \\"barely emerging from the waves\\" ; as being \\"much smaller than Lincoln Island\\" ; having a \\"twisting channel of reefs\\" ; and being unmistakable since \\"according to the most recent maps, no other island existed in this portion of the Pacific between New Zealand and the American coast.\\" If Verne is referring to real maps or current sightings, these would be as of 1873-1874. Verne goes on to explain that \\"It was really an islet, measuring no more than six miles in circumference, an elongated oval hardly fringed by any capes or promontories, coves, or creeks.\\" Returning to the story, after Lincoln Island is destroyed by explosion of its volcano, they are saved by \\"Duncan\\" whose crew was looking for Ayrton on Tabor island, but instead found there a note, indicating the existence of Lincoln island sheltering the heroes and Ayrton. The note turns out to have been specifically left on Tabor island by the benevolent Captain Nemo. The Vernian scholar, William Butcher, to sum up a complex situation of locating Tabor Island in real life, explains that Verne positions Tabor 153 degrees W of both Paris (as in Castaways) and Greenwich (as in Mysterious Island), whereas in real life it would be about 151 or 153 degrees W of only Greenwich (according to Krauth and Faivre, respectively). Furthermore, the character Cyrus Smith of The Mysterious Island seems to go wrong in his calculation of Tabor's position, possibly by as much as four degrees. Since Lincoln Island is positioned with reference to Tabor, this in turn means that the position of the Island can not reliably be determined. They could in fact be one and the same island due to a misreading of a meridian. References Further reading and external links * Eade, J. V. (1976).

It may also be regarded as the sodium salt of periodic acid. Like many periodates it can exist in two different forms: sodium metaperiodate, which has the formula NaIO4, and sodium orthoperiodate, normally this means sodium hydrogen periodate (Na2H3IO6) but the fully reacted sodium orthoperiodate salt, Na5IO6, can also be prepared. Both salts are useful oxidising agents.Andrew G. Wee, Jason Slobodian, Manuel A. Fern√°ndez- Rodr√≠guez and Enrique Aguilar \\"Sodium Periodate\\" e-EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2006. Preparation Classically, periodate was most commonly produced in the form of sodium hydrogen periodate (Na3H2IO6). This is commercially available, but can also be produced by the oxidation of iodates with chlorine and sodium hydroxide. Or, similarly, from iodides by oxidation with bromine and sodium hydroxide: :NaIO3 \\\\+ Cl2 \\\\+ 4 NaOH ‚Üí Na3H2IO6 \\\\+ 2 NaCl + H2O :NaI + 4 Br2 \\\\+ 10 NaOH ‚Üí Na3H2IO6 \\\\+ 8 NaBr + 4 H2O Modern industrial scale production involves the electrochemical oxidation of iodates, on a PbO2 anode, with the following standard electrode potential: :H5IO6 \\\\+ H+ \\\\+ 2 e‚àí ‚Üí + 3 H2O E¬∞ = 1.6 V Sodium metaperiodate can be prepared by the dehydration of sodium hydrogen periodate with nitric acid. :Na3H2IO6 \\\\+ 2 HNO3 ‚Üí NaIO4 \\\\+ 2 NaNO3 \\\\+ 2 H2O Structure Sodium metaperiodate (NaIO4) forms tetragonal crystals (space group I41/a) consisting of slightly distorted ions with average I‚ÄìO bond distances of 1.775 √Ö; the Na+ ions are surrounded by 8 oxygen atoms at distances of 2.54 and 2.60 √Ö. Sodium hydrogen periodate (Na2H3IO6) forms orthorhombic crystals (space group Pnnm). Iodine and sodium atoms are both surrounded by an octahedral arrangement of 6 oxygen atoms; however the NaO6 octahedron is strongly distorted. IO6 and NaO6 groups are linked via common vertices and edges. Powder diffraction indicates that Na5IO6 crystallises in the monoclinic system (space group C2/m). Uses Sodium periodate can be used in solution to open saccharide rings between vicinal diols leaving two aldehyde groups. This process is often used in labeling saccharides with fluorescent molecules or other tags such as biotin. Because the process requires vicinal diols, periodate oxidation is often used to selectively label the 3‚Ä≤-ends of RNA (ribose has vicinal diols) instead of DNA as deoxyribose does not have vicinal diols. NaIO4 is used in organic chemistry to cleave diols to produce two aldehydes. 650px In 2013 the US Army announced that it would replace environmentally harmful chemicals barium nitrate and potassium perchlorate with sodium metaperiodate for use in their tracer ammunition.

A common unique feature of the All India Services is that the members of these services are recruited by the centre (Union government in federal polity), but their services are placed under various State cadres, and they have the liability to serve both under the State and under the centre. Due to the federal polity of the country, this is considered one of the tools that makes union government stronger than state governments. Officers of these three services comply to the All India Services Rules relating to pay, conduct, leave, various allowances etc. The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions is the cadre controlling authority for the Administrative Service, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for the Forest Service and The Ministry of Home Affairs for the Police Service, while examination for recruitment of IAS and IPS is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on the basis of the annual Civil Services Examination, a common civil service examination, and for Forest Service on the basis of the Forest Service Examination. Since 2012 onwards, the preliminary (first test) of the two examinations are combined. These officers are recruited and trained by the Central Government, and then allotted to different State cadres. History The history of All India Services dates back to the British era when initially Civil Servants were appointed by the Court of Directors of the British East India Company. The service in those times was known as 'Covenanted Civil Service'. With time, they came to be known as Indian Civil Service (ICS). In 1947, with India gaining independence, ICS was replaced by Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police (IP) was replaced by Indian Police Service (IPS) and were recognised by the Indian Constitution as All-India Services. In 1963, Indian Forest Service was created and it came into existence in 1966. Power, purpose and responsibilities The All India Services Act, 1951 empowers the government of India to make, after consultation with state governments, rules for the regulation of recruitment and conditions of service of the persons appointed to an All India Service. All India Service is governed by All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968 which specifies the code of conduct for Civil Servant in general. The All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968 were amended latest by Govt. of India by notification published in official Gazette of India on 10 April 2015. =Nature of work= Responsibilities vary with the seniority of the civil servant. Junior officers begin with probation and move up in the hierarchy. At the district level the responsibilities are concerned with district matters as well as all developmental affairs while at the divisional level the responsibilities focus on law and order also. Policy framing is carried on at the State and Central levels. Allocation, division and cadres = Cadre allocation policy = The central government announced a new cadre allocation policy for the All India Services in August 2017, touting it as a policy to ensure national integration of the bureaucracy and to ensure an All India character of the services. The existing twenty- sixcadres were to be divided into fivezones by the Department of Personnel and Training. Under the new policy, a candidate first selects their zones of preference, in descending order, then indicates a cadre preference from each preferred zone. The candidate indicates his second cadre preference for every preferred zone subsequently. The preference for the zones and cadres remains in the same order and no change is permitted. Officers remain in their allocated cadre or are deputed to the Government of India. { class=\\"wikitable mw-collapsible\\" +Zones under the current cadre allocation policy !Zone !Cadres - !Zone-I AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territories), Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana - !Zone-II Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha - !Zone-III Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh - !Zone- IV West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam-Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Nagaland - !Zone-V Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala } =Indian Administrative Service= IAS Officers are trained to handle Government affairs. This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The Cabinet Secretary stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved. The implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed. The Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government. A civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a District Magistrate's office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as Principal Secretaries/Financial Commissioners in some states Each State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one Chief Secretary. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary . In the District, the administrative head is the Collector or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also. At the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue. =Indian Forest Service= India was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the Imperial Forest Department. In 1866 Dr. Dietrich Brandis, a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. Officers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in Germany and France, and from 1885 to 1905 at Cooper's Hill, London, which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, and University of Edinburgh undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers. From 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial Forest Research Institute (FRI) at Dehradun (established in 1906). Later The Indian Forest College (IFC) was established in 1938 at Dehradun, and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. Forestry, which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \\"provincial list\\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued. The modern Indian Forest Service was established in 1966, after independence, under the All India Services Act 1951, for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources. India has an area of 635,400 km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the Concurrent List. Ranks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, Divisional Forest Officer (DFOs), Deputy Conservator of Forests, Conservator of Forests (CFs), Chief Conservator of Forests (CCFs), Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Addl.PCCFs), Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State, Director General of Forests (India) - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states. The training at Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy is designed in such a way that an Forest Service officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to Forest Service officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the ISRO's Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, University of Twente/ITC Netherlands and in Wildlife Management from the Wildlife Institute of India. The Forest Service officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, SAARC Forestry Centre, Forest Survey of India, Wildlife Institute of India, Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme. =Indian Police Service= The Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after India gained independence from Britain, the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work. An IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as its Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers. The IPS officer takes charge as an Assistant Superintendent of Police of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as Superintendent of Police or Deputy Commissioner of Police after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as Senior Superintendent of Police and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12‚Äì14 years, then as Deputy Inspector General of Police or Additional Commissioner of Police in 15 years, an Inspector General of Police in 18 years, Additional Director General of Police in 25 years and finally, the Director General of Police after 30 years in service. IPS officers also work in national government agencies such as Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing, Central Bureau of Investigation, etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the Central Reserve Police Force and the Central Industrial Security Force, etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, Consul, Consul General, Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, High Commissioner and Ambassador. The Director General of Police and Commissioner of Police is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Madhya Pradesh etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The Inspector General or Joint Commissioner of Police is at the head of certain specialised police force like Criminal Investigation Department, Special Branch, etc. Reforms and changes In January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50. On recommendation by Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.

It is composed of a potassium cation and a periodate anion and may also be regarded as the potassium salt of periodic acid. Note that the pronunciation is per-iodate, not period-ate. Unlike other common periodates, such as sodium periodate and periodic acid, it is only available in the metaperiodate form; the corresponding potassium orthoperiodate (K5IO6) has never been reported. Preparation Potassium periodate can be prepared by the oxidation of an aqueous solution of potassium iodate by chlorine and potassium hydroxide. : It can also be generated by the electrochemical oxidation of potassium iodate, however the low solubility of KIO3 makes this approach of limited use. Chemical Properties Potassium periodate decomposes at 582 ¬∞C to form potassium iodate and oxygen. The low solubility of KIO4 makes it useful for the determination of potassium and cerium. It is slightly soluble in water (one of the less soluble of potassium salts, owing to a large anion), giving rise to a solution that is slightly alkaline. On heating (especially with manganese(IV) oxide as catalyst), it decomposes to form potassium iodate, releasing oxygen gas. KIO4 forms tetragonal crystals of the Scheelite type (space group I41/a).

Opened by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1860, it is served by South Western Railway‚Äôs London to Exeter services on the West of England Main Line. It is down the line from . History The station in the early years of the twentieth century. The station opened on 19 July 1860 by LSWR with its Exeter Extension from to Exeter Queen Street. Main offices and a goods shed were east of the line and a small engine shed existed for the locomotive kept here to help early trains up the 1-in-80 (1.25%) climb through Seaton Junction to . A signal box was built in 1875 (at the south end of the westbound platform). The established service pattern was interposed express trains between London Waterloo and other Devon final destinations or Cornwall and local services between Salisbury or Yeovil and Exeter. In 1903 Axminster became a junction when the Lyme Regis branch line was opened. A bay platform (terminus) was built (on the west side) yet the branch climbed at 1 in 80 (1.25%) to cross the main line south of the station by a bridge. A short 1-in-40 connection ran from the goods yard directly to the branch removed in 1915. The engine shed was demolished to make room for the new branch, but a new coal stage and water tank was built next to the terminus. The lever frame in the signal box was extended in 1903 to accommodate the new line, and three years later full signalling on the branch required the building to be extended. In 1923 the LSWR became part of the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The platforms were lengthened in the 1930s to accommodate longer trains and the new Axminster Carpets factory making Axminster carpets opened alongside the goods yard in 1937. On 1 January 1948 the Southern Railway was nationalised to become the Southern Region of British Railways. January 1963 saw the all the lines in the area transferred to the Western Region and this was soon followed by the Reshaping of British Railways report. On 29 November 1965 the Lyme Regis branch line was closed; goods traffic had been withdrawn in 1960. On 11 June 1967 the main line was rationalised ‚Äì Axminster was now in the middle of a single-track section between Chard Junction and Honiton. In the late 1980s the line found itself part of British Rail‚Äôs Network SouthEast sector, which invested in new Class 159 trains and extended the platform southwards to remove the need of passengers to pass beneath a narrow bridge arch to reach the 1930s extension at the north end of the site. The privatisation of British Rail in the 1990s saw the line and station franchised to South West Trains. Work started February 2009 on a ¬£20 million project which included building a new platform on the site of the disused platform, installing a new footbridge, lifts and waiting shelter, strengthening seven bridges and 20 culverts, installing 12 new signals, replacing three miles of signal cables and modernising the signalling panel at Chard Junction signal box and completed that December with a passing loop incorporating the station tracks. This allowed the previous sparse, irregular timetable to be replaced with a regular hourly frequency; trains being timetabled to pass at Axminster. The small building at the end of the main platform since 2009 reopened as a caf√©. Since December 2012 Rail Gourmet UK has had its satellite (auxiliary) service centre on site. An at- seat catering service serves many services from Axminster to Waterloo by hosts based at Axminster on morning train services. The service centre doubles as a turn-around station for its staff based at Salisbury. Description The station is on the west/south-west edge of the compact but linear town centre. The main building was designed by the LSWR's architect Sir William Tite and Edward Clifton in mock gothic style. An old parcels office next door houses the caf√©. Immediately south of the main building is the 2009-built footbridge between the two platforms. Unusually trains ran on the right but in late 2012, this was reversed: trains now run on the left.

Its capital is Ahmadpur East. With approximately 1 million inhabitants, it is the largest tehsil in terms of population in Pakistan. The main language spoken in the region is Saraiki. Urdu And Punjabi are also spoken. Urdu and English are the official languages used in various educational and government institutions.  History  The city of Ahmadpur East was once the capital of the former Princely State of Bahawalpur. It takes its name from Ahmed Khan, the son of Ghappa Khan Parjani, who was the first cousin of Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan I. On the invitation of Nawab Mubarak Khan, the dwelling where Ahmed Khan along with his family, tribe and supporters made their permanent abode was designated Ahmed Pur and the modern name is derived from this. Numerous important buildings and places constructed by the former rulers of Bahawalpur State remain in the city, including Sadiq Garh Palace, Qadeem Mahal and Jamia Masjid Chowk Bazaar.  Geography and climate  The city lies just south east of the Head Panjnad. It is situated 50 km from Bahawalpur, 470 km from Lahore, 15 km from Uch Shareef, 60 km from Yazman, 320 km from Faisalabad and about 750 km from the national capital, Islamabad. The west region of the city is called the Sindh. The chief crops are wheat, gram, cotton, sugarcane, dates, citrus and mangoes. Sheep and cattle are raised for export of wool and hides. It is chiefly desert irrigated by the Sutlej inundation canals and yields crops of wheat, cotton, and sugarcane. Farther south, the Cholistan, is a barren desert tract, bounded on the north and west by the Hakra depression with mound ruins of old settlements along its high banks; it is still inhabited by nomads. The climate is mainly hot and dry. In summer's the temperature reaches high forties degrees Celsius during the day and the nights slightly cooler. Since the city is located in a desert environment there is little rainfall. The weather conditions in area reach extremes in both summer and winter. Average temperature in summer is 33c and 18c in winter. Rainfall is very scarce and scanty. The average rainfall is 20 to 25 cm annually  Economy  Ahmedpur East is also an important agricultural training and educational center. Soapmaking and cotton ginning are important enterprises; cotton, silk, embroidery, carpets, and extraordinarily delicate pottery are produced. Factories producing cottonseed oil and cottonseed cake were built in the 1970s. It is an important marketing center for the surrounding areas and is located on the crossroads between Peshawar, Lahore, Quetta and Karachi. Ahmedpur East is also known for its distinctly embroidered khusa and pottery which is made here. The surrounding area is mostly agricultural, which allows agricultural exports in many parts of the world. There is also a large market town for mangoes, dates, wheat, sugarcane, and cotton that bring in continuous demand all year round. In addition, it has soap making and cotton spinning factories\\".  Culture  The city of Ahmedpur East is a tourist destination for not only locals but provides an important hotspot for historians and archeologists due to its rich heritage. The City Contains Sadiq Garh Palace Which Was Built In 1302 By Nawab Sadiq I And Many Old Buildings. The Derawar Fort is also in Ahmadpur East tehsil Ahmedpur East is known for its cotton, silk, embroidery, carpets, and extraordinarily delicate pottery.Census Information , StatPak.com, accessed October 2009 The saints of Ahmadpur Tehsil (1) Syed Mohammad Abdullah Shah Madni Jilani, son of Syed Abdul Rehman Jilani Dehlvi and a descendant of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani. Born and raised in Medina, he walked miles between Mecca and Madina in the heat. He then spent least 12 years of service at the Masjid-e-Nabwi and had a dream where Mohammad ordered him to find his murshid Sultan Bahu. He met Sultan Bahu on the 12th Rabi' al-awwal. During the reign of Nawab Bahawal Khan III, he migrated from Medina to Ahmadpur East for a permanent residence from 29th Ramazan 1241 H/6 May 1826 AD. He died on Friday of 29th Ramazan 1276 H/20 April 1860. His shrine is situated at Fatani Chowk, Fatani Street, Ahmadpur East. He was the 26th Shaikh of the Sarwari Qadri Order.

Bottom: The real part of the field after inserting in the path of the plane wave a small transparent disk of index of refraction higher than the index of the surrounding medium. This object scatters part of the wave field, although at any individual point, the wave's frequency and wavelength remain intact. In mathematics and physics, scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of waves and particles. Wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object, for instance sunlight scattered by rain drops to form a rainbow. Scattering also includes the interaction of billiard balls on a table, the Rutherford scattering (or angle change) of alpha particles by gold nuclei, the Bragg scattering (or diffraction) of electrons and X-rays by a cluster of atoms, and the inelastic scattering of a fission fragment as it traverses a thin foil. More precisely, scattering consists of the study of how solutions of partial differential equations, propagating freely \\"in the distant past\\", come together and interact with one another or with a boundary condition, and then propagate away \\"to the distant future\\". The direct scattering problem is the problem of determining the distribution of scattered radiation/particle flux basing on the characteristics of the scatterer. The inverse scattering problem is the problem of determining the characteristics of an object (e.g., its shape, internal constitution) from measurement data of radiation or particles scattered from the object. Since its early statement for radiolocation, the problem has found vast number of applications, such as echolocation, geophysical survey, nondestructive testing, medical imaging and quantum field theory, to name just a few. Conceptual underpinnings The concepts used in scattering theory go by different names in different fields. The object of this section is to point the reader to common threads. =Composite targets and range equations= Equivalent quantities used in the theory of scattering from composite specimens, but with a variety of units. When the target is a set of many scattering centers whose relative position varies unpredictably, it is customary to think of a range equation whose arguments take different forms in different application areas. In the simplest case consider an interaction that removes particles from the \\"unscattered beam\\" at a uniform rate that is proportional to the incident flux I of particles per unit area per unit time, i.e. that : \\\\frac{dI}{dx}=-QI \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where Q is an interaction coefficient and x is the distance traveled in the target. The above ordinary first-order differential equation has solutions of the form: : I = I_o e^{-Q \\\\Delta x} = I_o e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta x}{\\\\lambda}} = I_o e^{-\\\\sigma (\\\\eta \\\\Delta x)} = I_o e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\rho \\\\Delta x}{\\\\tau}} , where Io is the initial flux, path length Œîx ‚â° x ‚àí xo, the second equality defines an interaction mean free path Œª, the third uses the number of targets per unit volume Œ∑ to define an area cross-section œÉ, and the last uses the target mass density œÅ to define a density mean free path œÑ. Hence one converts between these quantities via Q = 1/Œª = Œ∑œÉ = œÅ/œÑ, as shown in the figure at left. In electromagnetic absorption spectroscopy, for example, interaction coefficient (e.g. Q in cm‚àí1) is variously called opacity, absorption coefficient, and attenuation coefficient. In nuclear physics, area cross-sections (e.g. œÉ in barns or units of 10‚àí24 cm2), density mean free path (e.g. œÑ in grams/cm2), and its reciprocal the mass attenuation coefficient (e.g. in cm2/gram) or area per nucleon are all popular, while in electron microscopy the inelastic mean free pathR. F. Egerton (1996) Electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the electron microscope (Second Edition, Plenum Press, NY) (e.g. Œª in nanometers) is often discussedLudwig Reimer (1997) Transmission electron microscopy: Physics of image formation and microanalysis (Fourth Edition, Springer, Berlin) instead. In theoretical physics In mathematical physics, scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the interaction or scattering of solutions to partial differential equations. In acoustics, the differential equation is the wave equation, and scattering studies how its solutions, the sound waves, scatter from solid objects or propagate through non-uniform media (such as sound waves, in sea water, coming from a submarine). In the case of classical electrodynamics, the differential equation is again the wave equation, and the scattering of light or radio waves is studied. In particle physics, the equations are those of Quantum electrodynamics, Quantum chromodynamics and the Standard Model, the solutions of which correspond to fundamental particles. In regular quantum mechanics, which includes quantum chemistry, the relevant equation is the Schr√∂dinger equation, although equivalent formulations, such as the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the Faddeev equations, are also largely used. The solutions of interest describe the long-term motion of free atoms, molecules, photons, electrons, and protons. The scenario is that several particles come together from an infinite distance away. These reagents then collide, optionally reacting, getting destroyed or creating new particles. The products and unused reagents then fly away to infinity again. (The atoms and molecules are effectively particles for our purposes. Also, under everyday circumstances, only photons are being created and destroyed.) The solutions reveal which directions the products are most likely to fly off to and how quickly. They also reveal the probability of various reactions, creations, and decays occurring. There are two predominant techniques of finding solutions to scattering problems: partial wave analysis, and the Born approximation. Elastic and inelastic scattering The term \\"elastic scattering\\" implies that the internal states of the scattered particles do not change, and hence they emerge unchanged from the scattering process. In inelastic scattering, by contrast, the particles' internal state is changed, which may amount to exciting some of the electrons of a scattering atom, or the complete annihilation of a scattering particle and the creation of entirely new particles. The example of scattering in quantum chemistry is particularly instructive, as the theory is reasonably complex while still having a good foundation on which to build an intuitive understanding. When two atoms are scattered off one another, one can understand them as being the bound state solutions of some differential equation. Thus, for example, the hydrogen atom corresponds to a solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation with a negative inverse-power (i.e., attractive Coulombic) central potential. The scattering of two hydrogen atoms will disturb the state of each atom, resulting in one or both becoming excited, or even ionized, representing an inelastic scattering process. The term \\"deep inelastic scattering\\" refers to a special kind of scattering experiment in particle physics. The mathematical framework In mathematics, scattering theory deals with a more abstract formulation of the same set of concepts. For example, if a differential equation is known to have some simple, localized solutions, and the solutions are a function of a single parameter, that parameter can take the conceptual role of time. One then asks what might happen if two such solutions are set up far away from each other, in the \\"distant past\\", and are made to move towards each other, interact (under the constraint of the differential equation) and then move apart in the \\"future\\". The scattering matrix then pairs solutions in the \\"distant past\\" to those in the \\"distant future\\". Solutions to differential equations are often posed on manifolds. Frequently, the means to the solution requires the study of the spectrum of an operator on the manifold. As a result, the solutions often have a spectrum that can be identified with a Hilbert space, and scattering is described by a certain map, the S matrix, on Hilbert spaces. Spaces with a discrete spectrum correspond to bound states in quantum mechanics, while a continuous spectrum is associated with scattering states. The study of inelastic scattering then asks how discrete and continuous spectra are mixed together. An important, notable development is the inverse scattering transform, central to the solution of many exactly solvable models.

It originally aired in broadcast syndication beginning on January 10, 1993. The episode was written by Katharyn Powers, with additional elements added by executive producer Michael Piller and co-producer Peter Allan Fields. It was directed by Winrich Kolbe. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode, a Bajoran terrorist seeks asylum aboard the station from pursuing Cardassians, publicly renouncing his past violent ways. He begins liaising with the Duras sisters (Barbara March and Gwynyth Walsh), leading to suspicion that he was planning further acts of terrorism and causing Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) to consider her loyalties. The episode introduces the character of Garak, played by Andrew Robinson, who would return in the second season and made continued appearances throughout the series. The character's traits were developed by Robinson, who was praised for his work by Kolbe. \\"Past Prologue\\" was the second most watched episode of the season, receiving a Nielsen rating of 13.4 percent. It was received positively by critics, who praised the introduction of Garak, although it was suggested that the plot was predictable due to the need to maintain the status quo at the end of the episode. Plot The crew of Deep Space Nine rescue the Bajoran Tahna Los (Jeffrey Nordling) from a vessel that is being attacked by the Cardassians. They state that Tahna is a known member of a terrorist organization and demand his return, but Tahna asks for political asylum, pleading to his former friend Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) for help. Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) grants his request. Later, Odo (Ren√© Auberjonois) spots Tahna with the Duras sisters (Barbara March and Gwynyth Walsh) making covert discussions. Tahna also seeks to gain the use of a runabout from Kira. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig), thanks to his new-found friend Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson), overhears the Duras sisters planning to rendezvous with the Bajoran to give him a vial of bilitrium, a crystalline compound that can release a tremendous amount of power, but only if connected to an antimatter converter. Garak reveals why the Cardassians were chasing Tahna: he stole one from them, meaning he will have the component materials required to build a bomb. With no solid evidence to act currently, the crew allow him to take a runabout and intend to arrest him after the transaction. Kira finds herself confused about her own past with the Bajoran resistance and where her current loyalties stand, and offers to go with Tahna in the runabout. Commander Sisko and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) wait in a second runabout nearby while Tahna and Kira complete the transaction. When the second runabout appears, Tahna realizes he has been set up; matters are further complicated by the arrival of the Cardassian warship. Tahna orders Kira at gunpoint to return to the station, intending to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira to return to the Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this was the right thing to do someday. Production Although it was shown second in broadcast order following the pilot, \\"Past Prologue\\" was filmed third, following \\"A Man Alone\\". There were several changes to hair and makeup following \\"A Man Alone\\", including modifications to Odo, and a simpler, closer haircut for Nana Visitor in her role as Major Kira. Visitor had pushed for her changes as she did not find it believable that the character would style her hair on a daily basis, instead wanting a look that took minimal effort.Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 21 The episode was directed by Winrich Kolbe, in line with executive producer Rick Berman's policy of only allowing directors with previous experience on Star Trek: The Next Generation work on the first season of Deep Space Nine.Reeves-Stevens & Reeves-Stevens (1994): p. 212 He would go on to direct the series finale of The Next Generation, \\"All Good Things...\\",Nemecek (2003): p. 298 and 48 episodes of the franchise across four separate series. Katharyn Powers received the sole writing credit on the episode, although elements such as Garak were created by co-producer Peter Allan Fields. Powers had previously written \\"Code of Honor\\", a first season episode of The Next Generation.Nemecek (2003): p. 33 An initial version of her script featured Kira and Tahna as lovers, which was rejected by executive producer Michael Piller. The ending originally showed the terrorist giving up his violent ways and seeking peace with the Cardassians before being killed by the Bajorans.Gross & Altman (1996): p. 41 The episode was named after the line from William Shakespeare's The Tempest; \\"what‚Äôs past is prologue.\\" =Guest appearances= \\"Past Prologue\\" marked the first appearance of Garak, played by Andrew Robinson (pictured). Following a suggestion by Piller, the Duras sisters were written into the episode.Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 22 The duo had previously appeared in the two-part The Next Generation episode \\"Redemption\\" and would go on to appear in \\"Firstborn\\" and the film Star Trek Generations.Nemecek (2003): p. 168Nemecek (2003): p. 314 The character of Admiral Rollman made her first appearance in \\"Past Prologue\\", and would later return in the second season episode \\"Whispers\\". Susan Bay, who played Rollman, has a long-standing relationship with the Star Trek franchise as she was the wife of Leonard Nimoy, the actor who portrayed Spock in Star Trek: The Original Series and the film series. Also appearing in this episode was Vaughn Armstrong, who would go on to play thirteen different characters within the franchise,Garcia & Phillips (2009): p. 279 including the recurring part of Rear Admiral Maxwell Forrest in Star Trek: Enterprise. The episode is best known for the introduction of the recurring character Elim Garak. Fields said of the character at the time, \\"we didn't want to make him an out and out spy, because then what would you do with him after the episode? You'd have to put him in jail on Bajor. So we tread a pretty thin line.\\" Fields had decided when creating the character that the station needed a Cardassian on-board and when no-one objected to his suggestion to put him in a tailor shop, that became Garak's profession. This was a reference to The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which used a tailor shop as a front, as Fields had begun his writing career on that series. Andrew Robinson had originally been considered for the part of Odo, and was one of the final three actors vying for the part alongside Gerrit Graham and Ren√© Auberjonois. Robinson was invited back to audition for Garak, while Graham was cast as the Hunter in \\"Captive Pursuit\\".Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 27 Kolbe thought at first that casting Robinson was \\"really off- the-way\\" but he felt the actor made the episode \\"bloom\\". He gave general guidelines to Robinson about how he could approach the character, but it was Robinson who developed the traits of the character. Kolbe also praised the writing saying that \\"I wish there was more writing like this for television. I think we'd have a much healthier industry.\\" Robinson said that Garak was a complicated character which required the use of subtext, adding that it wasn't a simple way to portray a character \\"but when you do it well, you really get people's attention\\". He was told by the producers that they intended to bring him back onto the show, but in a later interview, he said that this was commonplace in the industry and doesn't usually occur. When he was brought back for the second-season episode \\"Cardassians\\", executive producer Ira Steven Behr apologized for not bringing him back sooner.Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 90 Reception and home media release \\"Past Prologue\\" was first released in broadcast syndication on January 11, 1993. It received a Nielsen rating of 13.4 percent, placing second in its timeslot. This was the second highest rated episode of the season, behind \\"Emissary\\". In 2012, Zack Handlen wrote for The A.V. Club that Garak was \\"striking\\" from his first appearance, and it was immediately apparent that he was an important character. He compared Kira's problem of loyalty to those experienced by Ro Laren in The Next Generation episode \\"Preemptive Strike\\", however it didn't work as well since the show would have to maintain the status quo by the end of the episode since Kira was a main character. He summarized, saying that it was a good episode but not great. In 2013, Keith DeCandido wrote for Tor.com that Garak could have been a \\"walking, talking clich√©\\", but that Robinson \\"imbues him with such charm that it‚Äôs impossible not to love the character\\". He said that it was an excellent episode, due in part to the way that the character's dynamics are formed. He gave it a rating of eight out of ten. The first home media release of the episode was on VHS cassette in the United States on September 10, 1996. It was part of the initial launch of cassettes by Paramount Home Video which saw the first six episodes released and was on a single episode cassette. It was released on DVD as part of the season one box set on June 3, 2003.  Watch guides  In 2018, SyFy recommend \\"Past Prologue\\" for its abbreviated watch for the Bajoran character Kira Nerys. They explain that the episode helps establish Kira's backstory, as she encounters a previous relation from the days of the occupation; as the story unfolds her relationship with the Federation is also established.

Initially proposed as only a province, South Kasai sought full autonomy in similar circumstances to the much larger neighbouring state of Katanga, to its south, during the political turmoil arising from the independence of the Belgian Congo known as the Congo Crisis. Unlike Katanga, however, South Kasai did not explicitly declare full independence from the Republic of the Congo or reject Congolese sovereignty. The South Kasaian leader and main advocate, Albert Kalonji, who had represented a faction of the nationalist movement (the Mouvement National Congolais-Kalonji or MNC-K) before decolonisation, exploited ethnic tensions between his own ethnic group, the Baluba, and the Bena Lulua to create a Luba- focused state in the group's traditional heartland in the south-eastern parts of the Kasai region. As sectarian violence broke out across the country, the state declared its secession from the Congo on 9 August 1960 and its government and called for the Baluba living in the rest of the Congo to return to their \\"homeland\\". Kalonji was appointed President. Although the South Kasaian government claimed to form an autonomous part of a federal Congo-wide state, it exercised a degree of regional autonomy and even produced its own constitution and postage stamps. The state, supported by foreign powers, particularly Belgium, and funded by diamond exports, managed numerous crises, including those caused by the large emigration of Luba refugees, but became increasingly militarist and repressive. Soon after its secession, South Kasaian and Congolese troops clashed after the Congolese central government ordered an offensive against it. The resulting campaign, planned to be the first act of a larger action against Katanga, was accompanied by widespread massacres of Baluba and a refugee crisis termed a genocide by some contemporaries. The state was rapidly overrun by Congolese troops. The violence in the suppression of Kasai provided much legitimacy to Joseph Kasa- Vubu's deposition of Patrice Lumumba from the office of Prime Minister in late 1960 and Lumumba's later arrest and assassination. As a result, South Kasai remained on relatively good terms with the new Congolese government from 1961. Its leaders, including Kalonji himself, served in both the South Kasaian government and the Congolese parliament. South Kasai continued to exercise quasi-independence while Congolese and United Nations troops were able to move through the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian gendarmerie. In April 1961, Kalonji took the royal title Mulopwe (\\"King of the Baluba\\") to tie the state more closely to the pre-colonial Luba Empire. The act divided the South Kasaian authorities and Kalonji was disavowed by the majority of South Kasai's parliamentary representatives in L√©opoldville. In December 1961, Kalonji was arrested on a legal pretext in L√©opoldville and imprisoned, and Ferdinand Kazadi assumed power as acting head of state. UN and Congolese troops occupied South Kasai. In September 1962, shortly after his escape from prison and return to South Kasai, Kalonji was ousted by a military coup d'√©tat which forced him into exile and brought the secession to an end. The end of South Kasai's secession is usually held to be either December 1961, the date of Kalonji's arrest, or October 1962 with the anti-Kalonji coup d'√©tat and final arrival of government troops. Background =Colonial rule= Luba chiefs of the Congo Free State, 1900 European colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, frustrated by his country's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. The Luba Empire, the largest regional power in the Kasai region, was annexed into the new state in 1889. By the turn of the century, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo. Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the \\"colonial trinity\\" (trinit√© coloniale) of state, missionary and private company interests. The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied and the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by the indigenous population. The country was split into hierarchically-organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set \\"native policy\\" (politique indig√®ne) ‚Äì in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. =Ethnicity= Before the start of the colonial period, the region of South Kasai formed part of the Luba Empire, a federation of local kingdoms with a degree of cultural uniformity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baluba spread across large parts of the Kasai-Katanga savannah along the Kasai river basin and eventually developed into a number of ethnic subgroups, notably the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga. Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained a degree of emotional attachment based around shared origin myths and cultural practices. Other groups, like the Songye and the Kanyok, also had long histories in the Kasai region. One of the major legacies of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) and culture of the two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities. During the 1950s when the Belgians began to fear that the rise of a powerful Luba elite would become a threat to colonial rule, the administration began to support Lulua organisations. This further contributed to the growing ethnic polarisation between the two groups. In 1952, an organisation called the Lulua Fr√®res (Lulua Brothers) was established to campaign for socio-economic advancement of the Lulua group and became an unofficial representative of the Bena Lulua. In 1959, Luba-Lulua animosity was brought to a head by the discovery of a colonial proposal to move Luba farmers out of Lulua land to the less fertile land on Luba territory. As a result, hostility increased and violent clashes broke out. In August 1959, Luba demonstrations against the plan which were violently repressed by the colonial military and police. =Nationalist movement and Congolese politics= Patrice Lumumba split with Kalonji in 1959 and denied his supporters roles in central government. Congolese nationalism An anti-colonial Pan-African and nationalist movement developed in the Belgian Congo during the 1950s, primarily among the √©volu√© class (the urbanised black bourgeoisie). The movement was divided into a number of parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another. The largest, the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), was a united front organisation dedicated to achieving independence \\"within a reasonable\\" time. It was created around a charter which was signed by, among others, Patrice Lumumba, Cyrille Adoula and Joseph Il√©o. Lumumba became a leading figure and by the end of 1959, the party claimed to have 58,000 members. However, many found the MNC was too moderate. A number of other parties emerged, distinguished by their radicalism, support for federalism or centralism and affiliation to certain ethnic groupings. The MNC's main rival was the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, a more radical party supported among the Kongo people in the north, and Mo√Øse Tshombe's Conf√©d√©ration des Associations Tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT), a strongly federalist party in the southern Katanga Province. Kalonji- Lumumba split and polarisation Albert Kalonji broke with Lumumba and later led the secession of South Kasai. Although it was the largest of the African nationalist parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate √©volu√©s and the more radical mass membership. A radical and federalist faction headed by Ileo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who endured with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, popular in the south and among Kalonji's own ethnic group, the Baluba. The MNC-K later formed a cartel with ABAKO and the Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA) to call for a united, but federalised, Congo. The 1960 elections degenerated into an \\"anti-Baluba plebiscite\\" in Kasai as the Luba MNC-K succeeded in obtaining a plurality but failed to take control of the provincial government. Instead, Lumumba promoted a Lulua candidate, Barth√©lemy Mukenge, as provincial president while Kalonji was denied an important ministerial portfolio in Lumumba's national government. Kalonji refused Lumumba's offer of the Agriculture portfolio. Mukenge attempted to form a government of unity, even offering MNC-K member Joseph Ngalula a place in his cabinet. Ngalula rejected the offer and on 14 June the MNC-K resolved to establish an alternative government under his leadership. Kalonji did not recognise this government as having any authority. The Kalonjists, who felt rejected and marginalised by the central government, began supporting alternative parties. Among them, the Kalonjists supported Tshombe's CONAKAT party in nearby Katanga which, because of its strongly federalist stance, opposed to Lumumba's conception of a strong central government based in the capital L√©opoldville. As part of this, the Kalonjists supported CONAKAT against their main local rivals, the Association G√©n√©rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT) party led by Jason Sendwe, which, although it represented the Baluba of Katanga Province, was in favour of centralism. The Kalonjists, who believed themselves to be acting on behalf of all the Luba-Kasai, created an animosity between the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga but also failed to gain the full support of CONAKAT, much of which had racial prejudice against the Baluba and supported only the \\"authentic Katangese\\". Secession =Persecution of the Baluba= The Republic of the Congo received independence on 30 June 1960 with Kasa-Vubu as president and Lumumba as prime minister. The Chamber of the L√©opoldville Parliament had convened one week prior to review Lumumba's cabinet and give it a vote of confidence. During the session, Kalonji, in his capacity as an elected deputy, criticised the proposed cabinet, expressing dissatisfaction that his party had not been consulted in its formation and declaring that he was proud not to be included in an \\"anti-Baluba\\" and \\"anti-Batshoke\\" government which had shown contempt for the wishes of Kasai's people. He also stated his intentions to encourage the Baluba and Batshoke to refrain from participating in the government and to take his own steps to form a sovereign state centered in Bakwanga. On 26 June, MNC-K officials petitioned the L√©opoldville Parliament to peacefully divide the Province of Kasai along the lines suggested by Kalonji. The motion, which would have required the modification of the Congo's new constitution (Loi fondamentale), was received by a legislature divided between Lumumba and Kasa- Vubu factions and no agreement could be reached. In the aftermath of independence, ethnic tensions flared up across the country, much of it directed against the Baluba, and a number of violent clashes occurred. On 3 July the central government ordered the arrest of the rival MNC-K Kasai government, precipitating unrest in Luluabourg. Despite rejecting earlier proposals for Luba repatriations to the province in January 1960, the Kalonjists made an official call to the Baluba across the Congo to return to their Kasaian \\"homeland\\" on 16 July. Initially, the Kalonjists envisaged the division of Kasai Province in two in order to allow for the creation of a quasi-autonomous MNC-K and Luba-dominated provincial government. The proposed province was termed the Federated State of South Kasai (√âtat f√©d√©ratif du Sud- Kasa√Ø). Rapidly, however, Kalonji realised that the chaos in the rest of the Congo could be used to secede unilaterally and declare full local independence. This decision was further re-enforced by the full secession of the State of Katanga (√âtat du Katanga), led by Tshombe, on 11 July 1960. Kalonji visited Katanga at the start of August 1960, shortly after its secession, where, on the 8 August, he declared that Kasai \\"must be divided at all costs.\\" =Secession= 100px On 9 August 1960, Kalonji, still in Katanga, declared the region of south-eastern Kasai to be the new Mining State of South Kasai (√âtat minier du Sud-Kasa√Ø) or Autonomous State of South Kasai (√âtat autonome du Sud-Kasa√Ø). Unlike Katanga, however, South Kasai's secession did not explicitly mean the rejection of its position within the Republic of the Congo. Rather, it resembled the self-declared local governments in √âquateur Province. The \\"Autonomous State\\" title was chosen in order to re-enforce the impression that the secession was not a rejection of Congolese sovereignty, but the creation of a federally-governed region of the Congo. The secession had some support among journalists, intellectuals and politicians in L√©opoldville, with one newspaper calling it \\"a model by which the many new states now mushrooming in the Congo might form a new federation\\". In practice South Kasai had considerably more independence than a regular province and, by mandating its own federated powers unilaterally, was effectively seceding from the Congo. It also did not forward any taxes to the central government and locals‚Äîdrawing a comparison to the secessionist state to the south‚Äîsometimes referred to it as \\"Little Katanga\\". MNC-K deputies also initially refused to sit in the Congolese Parliament in L√©opoldville. Kalonji was declared President and Joseph Ngalula Prime Minister. Although the Luba-Kasai had never lived in a single state before, Kalonji was able to gain the broad support of the Luba chiefs for the secession. He was able to portray the secession internationally as the result of the persecution and the failure of the Congolese government to sufficiently protect the Baluba in the rest of the Congo. At its height, South Kasai numbered around a million inhabitants and of territory, though its borders frequently changed. The state's capital was Bakwanga. =Governance= Once established in power, Kalonji positioned himself personally as \\"big man\\" and patron from whom state power originated. Tribal leaders from Luba and other ethnic groups enjoyed a close, client-like relationship with Kalonji himself and received preferential treatment in exchange for services rendered. In particular, Kalonji was reliant on tribal leaders to mobilise paramilitaries to support the South Kasaian army. Governance of South Kasai was complicated by the dynamic Luba politics in which it was embedded. Tensions rose between Kalonji and Ngalula, who had different ideas for how the state was to be run; Kalonji wanted the government to be based in tradition and relied on customary chiefs, while Ngalula preferred a democratic system and worked with the intellectual elite. South Kasai had five different governments in the first few months of its existence. Postage stamps of South Kasai, overprinted onto earlier issues of the Belgian Congoleft The immediate internal problems faced by South Kasai were large number of unsettled Luba refugees and internal dissent from non-Luba minorities. The state was able to direct money from diamond exporting and foreign support to fund public services which allowed Luba refugees to be settled in employment. Social services were \\"relatively well-run\\". State revenue was estimated to total $30,000,000 annually. The state produced three constitutions, with the first being promulgated in November and the last on 12 July 1961. The July constitution transformed the state into the Federated State of South Kasai (√âtat f√©d√©r√© du Sud-Kasa√Ø), declaring the state itself both \\"sovereign and democratic\\" but also part of a hypothetical \\"Federal Republic of the Congo\\". The constitution also provided for a bicameral legislature, with a lower chamber composed of all national deputies, senators, and provincial assemblymen elected in constituencies within South Kasai's territory, and an upper chamber filled by traditional chiefs. The state had its own flag and coat of arms, published its own official journal, the Moniteur de l'√âtat Autonome du Sud-Kasa√Ø, and even produced its own postage stamps and vehicle registration plates. Unlike Katanga, South Kasai maintained no diplomatic missions abroad. The Congolese franc was retained as the state's currency. The South Kasaian army or gendarmerie grew from just 250 members at its inception to nearly 3,000 by 1961. It was led by 22-year-old \\"General\\" Floribert Dinanga with the assistance of nine European officers. In 1961, the military led a campaign to expand the size of the state's territory at the expense of neighbouring ethnic groups. Despite receiving some support from Belgium, the gendarmerie was poorly equipped and constantly low on supplies and ammunition. As government authority in South Kasai was consolidated, the regime became increasingly militaristic and authoritarian. Non-Luba groups were increasingly marginalised. Political opponents were killed or driven into exile, including Ngalula, who had a falling out with Kalonji in July 1961. Non-Luba groups in the region, especially the Kanyok, fought a constant but low-level insurgency against the South Kasaian government. =International support= yellow diamond from South Kasai; diamond exporting was a major asset to the state. Kalonji went to great lengths to secure international recognition and support for the state of South Kasai. The former colonial power, Belgium, distrusted the Congolese central government and supported both the governments of South Kasai and Katanga. Like Katanga, South Kasai had important mineral deposits, including diamond fields, and Belgian companies had large sums of money tied up in mines in the area. A Belgian company, , was the state's principal supporter and received concessions from South Kasai in exchange for financial support. The comparatively large income from these companies meant that South Kasai was able to support significant public services and cope with large numbers of internally-displaced Luba refugees. In the context of the Cold War, Kalonji was supported by Western powers and moderates in the Congolese government who viewed him as both a moderate pro- Westerner and anticommunist. Although both Katanga and South Kasai were supported by South Africa, France and the Central African Federation, neither state ever received any form of official diplomatic recognition. After the coup d'√©tat which removed Lumumba from power, Kalonji tried to cultivate good relations with the Congolese government. General Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu, in particular, was able to use South Kasai for the execution of his political opponents and dissident Lumumbists including Jean-Pierre Finant. Such activity led the secessionist state to be nicknamed \\"the national butcher's yard\\". =Kalonji as Mulopwe= Because of the importance of the Luba ethnicity to South Kasai, Kalonji used his support from the traditional Luba tribal authorities to have himself declared Mulopwe. The title, Mulopwe (usually translated as \\"King\\" or \\"Emperor\\"), was extremely symbolic because it was the title employed by the rulers of the pre-colonial Luba Empire and had been disused since the 1880s. By taking it, along with the extra name Ditunga (\\"homeland\\"), Kalonji was able to closely tie himself and the South Kasaian state to the Luba Empire to increase its legitimacy in the eyes of the Baluba. In order to avoid accusations of impropriety, the title was bestowed on Kalonji's father on 12 April 1961, who then immediately abdicated in favour of his son. With the accession of Kalonji to the title of Mulopwe on 16 July, the state's title changed to the Federated Kingdom of South Kasai (Royaume f√©d√©r√© du Sud-Kasa√Ø). Kalonji's accession to the position of Mulopwe was heavily criticised even by many Luba in South Kasai. Kalonji remained popular among some groups, but lost the support of the South Kasaian √©volu√©s who saw his elevation as flagrant opportunism. Soon after his elevation, Kalonji was publicly condemned and disavowed by 10 of South Kasai's 13 representatives in the L√©opoldville Parliament, beginning the disintegration of the secessionist state. Collapse and reintegration =Campaign of August‚ÄìSeptember 1960= When South Kasai seceded, government troops from the Arm√©e Nationale Congolaise (ANC) were already fighting Katangese troops in the Kasai region. South Kasai held important railway junctions needed by the Congolese army for its campaign in Katanga, and therefore soon became an important objective. South Kasai also had important mineral wealth which the central government was anxious to return to the Congo. The central government also misunderstood the South Kasaian position, believing that, like Katanga, the region had declared full independence from the Congo and rejected Congolese sovereignty. Initially, Lumumba hoped that the United Nations (UN), which sent a multi- national peacekeeping force to the Congo in July 1960, would help the central government suppress both Katangese and South Kasaian secessions. The UN was reluctant to do so, however, considering the secessions to be internal political matters and its own mission to be maintaining basic law and order. Rejected by both the UN and United States, Lumumba sought military support from the communist Soviet Union. Within days of the secession and with Soviet logistical support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was successful. On 27 August, ANC soldiers arrived in Bakwanga. During the course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in ethnic violence between the Baluba and Bena Lulua. When government troops arrived in Bakwanga, they released Lulua detainees from prison and began requisitioning civilian vehicles. When David Odia, the South Kasai Minister of Public Works, protested, soldiers beat him and fatally injured him. Many Baluba first fled in terror, but then began resisting with home-made shotguns. As a result, the ANC perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. In September, Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, the UN Secretary-General who had recently deployed a large peacekeeping force to the Congo, referred to the massacres as \\"a case of incipient genocide\\". The Baluba were also attacked by the Katangese from the south. In the ensuring massacres, in which ANC or Katangese troops often participated, around 3,000 Baluba were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of many thousands of Luba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting; more than 35,000 went to refugee camps in √âlisabethville (the capital of Katanga) alone. As many as 100,000 sought refuge in Bakwanga. Diseases, notably kwashiorkor but also malaria, smallpox and anemia, were widespread and reached \\"epidemic proportions\\" among Luba refugees between October and December 1960. The World Health Organization sent one million small pox vaccines to South Kasai to alleviate the problem. The epidemic had been preceded by widespread famine which by December was killing an estimated 200 people daily. The UN appealed to its member states for relief, and by late January government and private aid had reduced mortality by 75 percent. Further assistance in the form of an emergency food airlift, additional medical personnel, and seeds from the Food and Agriculture Organization ensured that the famine was almost entirely resolved by March 1961. Allegations of genocide and brutality by the ANC were used to provide legitimacy to Kasa-Vubu's dismissal of Lumumba, with the support of Mobutu, in September 1960. In the aftermath of the campaign, the South Kasaian state was able to provide substantial aid to its refugees, many of whom were resettled in homes and jobs. Nevertheless, the invasion caused considerable disruption to the local economy; by December the number of diamonds cut by Formini√®re and the number of people it employed both had fallen by thousands. =Coexistence and attempted reconciliation= Kalonji with Congolese President Joseph Kasa- Vubu in 1961 Despite the occupation of South Kasai, the South Kasaian state was not dismantled and co-existed with the rest of the Congo. Congolese delegates, as well as ANC and UN troops were generally able to move around the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian authorities while their sporadic campaign against Katangese forces continued. A UN-sponsored ceasefire in September 1960 gave pause to the Luba-Lulua conflict, but by November Kalonji's forces had broken the truce. Throughout much of the period, the South Kasaian gendarmerie fought with Kanyok and Lulua militias across the region while local ethnic violence persisted. In mid-1961, conferences were held at Coquilhatville (modern-day Mbandaka) and later in Antananarivo, Madagascar to attempt to broker a peaceful reconciliation between the secessionist factions and the central government in the face of a rebel government in the Eastern Congo led by Antoine Gizenga. It was believed that, with Lumumba dead, it might be possible to create a federal constitution that could reconcile the three parties. The agreements instead led to more uncertainty. The ousting of Ngalula‚Äîthe chief organiser of the South Kasai state‚Äîin July hastened internal collapse. He established his own political party, the Democratic Union, to oppose the Kalonjists. Later that month Parliament reconvened with Kalonji and the other South Kasain deputies in attendance. A new Congolese central government was formed on 2 August with Ngalula as Minister of Education, and Kalonji went back to South Kasai. In late October 1961 Kalonji and several Lulua leaders made a symbolic union in an attempt to end the Luba-Lulua tribal conflict. =Kalonji's arrest= Map showing the situation in the Congo in 1961 with the territory split between four opposing factions On 2 December 1961, Kalonji was accused by another deputy, the communist Christophe Gbenye, of having ordered corporal punishment against a political prisoner in South Kasai. Parliament voted to remove Kalonji's parliamentary immunity and he was taken into custody by the ANC in L√©opoldville. A delegation of around 400 Luba tribal elders sent to L√©opoldville to protest were also briefly arrested. Mobutu and General Victor Lundula visited Bakwanga soon afterwards. Ferdinand Kazadi assumed power as acting head of state of South Kasai. On 9 March 1962, the recently re-convened L√©opoldville Parliament, under Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula, agreed to modify the Constitution and gave South Kasai official provincial status. In April 1962, UN troops were ordered to occupy South Kasai as part of Secretary- General U Thant's new aggressive stance against secession following Hammarskj√∂ld's death. In L√©opoldville, Kalonji was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. On 7 September, however, Kalonji escaped from prison and returned to South Kasai where he hoped to regain an official position in local elections and, at the head of a government, regain his immunity. =Coup d'√©tat of September‚ÄìOctober 1962= As dissatisfaction with the secession grew, Ngalula and other South Kasaian √©migr√©s in L√©opoldville plotted to overthrow the regime in Bakwanga. In September 1962, the L√©opoldville government appointed Albert Kankolongo, a former minister in Kalonji's government, as Special Commissioner (commissaire extraordinaire) for South Kasai, giving him full military and civil power, to dismantle the local state. Ngalula approached Kankolongo to lead a mutiny and coup d'√©tat against Kalonji. On the night of 29‚Äì30 September 1962, military commanders in South Kasai, led by Kankolongo, launched a coup d'√©tat in Bakwanga against the Kalonjist regime. An appeal was broadcast over Radio Bakwanga to all officers of the South Kasaian gendarmerie to support the central government with the promise that they would integrated into the ANC at their current rank and pay. Kalonji and General Dinanga were placed under house arrest, while the other South Kasain ministers were imprisoned in a single home. Kalonji and Dinanga escaped a few days later; the former took a lorry to Katanga. Kankolongo reacted by immediately flying out the remaining ministers to L√©opoldville. On 5 October 1962, central government troops again arrived in Bakwanga to support the mutineers and help suppress the last Kalonjist loyalists, marking the end of the secession. Kalonji took up residence in Kamina and attempted to meet Tshombe, but was rebuffed by Katangese Minister of Interior Godefroid Munongo. He then fled to Paris before settling in Barcelona in Francisco Franco's Spain. Aftermath =In Kasai= 1963 stamp celebrating the \\"reconciliation\\" of South Kasai and Katanga with the Congolese central government In October 1962, South Kasai returned to the Republic of the Congo. The State of Katanga continued to hold out against the central government until it too collapsed in January 1963 after UN forces began to take a more aggressive stance under Thant. As a compromise, South Kasai was one of the 21 provinces formally established by the federalist constitution of 1964. As the Mobutu regime launched a centralist restructuring of the Congolese state from 1965, South Kasai was one of the few provinces which were retained. The province was later restructured to include new territory in Kabinda and Sankuru Districts and renamed Eastern Kasai (Kasa√Ø-Oriental). The majority of the South Kasaian soldiers were integrated into the ANC after the dissolution of the state but nearly 2,000 loyalists went into hiding to await Kalonji's possible restoration. The rebels were led by General Mwanzambala and fought a guerrilla war against the new provincial government until 1963 when they also accepted integration into the ANC. Soon after the end of the secession, the city of Bakwanga was renamed Mbuji-Mayi after the local river in an attempt to signify a Luba intra-ethnicity reconciliation. Regardless, violence among Luba factions lasted through 1964, and a political solution was not reached until 1965 with the election of J. Munkamba as Provincial President of South Kasai. =End of the Congo Crisis= In 1965, Mobutu launched a second coup d'√©tat against the central government and took personal emergency powers. Once established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to illustrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's revised constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed Zaire and efforts were made to remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country. Over time Zaire was increasingly characterised by widespread cronyism, corruption, and economic mismanagement. Dissatisfaction with the regime in Kasa√Ø-Oriental was particularly strong. The issues of federalism, ethnicity in politics, and state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed to a decline in support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government is one of the reasons that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.

Australia Independents are a recurrent feature of the federal Parliament of Australia, and they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. There have been up to five independents in every federal parliament since 1990, and independents have won twenty-eight times during national elections in that time. A large proportion of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian Greens, or the National Party of Australia. In 2013 a political party named the Australian Independents was registered with the Australian Electoral Commission. At the dissolution of parliament before the 2019 federal election, four independents sat in the Australian House of Representatives: Andrew Wilkie (Member for Denison), Cathy McGowan (Member for Indi), Kerryn Phelps (Member for Wentworth), and Julia Banks (Member for Chisholm). Of these, Wilkie had previously been a Greens candidate, McGowan had been a Liberal staffer, and Banks was elected as a Liberal MP before resigning from the party in November 2018. At the 2019 election, Wilkie was re-elected as the Member for Clark, while McGowan retired, and both Phelps and Banks lost their seats. However, two new independents entered parliament: Zali Steggall (Member for Warringah) and Helen Haines (Member for Indi). Independent Senators are quite rare. In modern politics, Independent Brian Harradine served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times. Nick Xenophon has been the only elected independent Senator since his election to the Senate at the 2007 federal election. Xenophon was re-elected for another six-year term at the 2013 federal election. DLP Senator John Madigan became an independent Senator in September 2014, while PUP Senators Jacqui Lambie and Glenn Lazarus became Independent Senators in November 2014 and March 2015.  Azerbaijan  In Azerbaijan, there are many independent members of the National Assembly, such as Ayt…ôn Mustafayeva. Brazil Independent politicians are not allowed to run for office in Brazil. The Constitution of 1988, in Article 14, ¬ß3rd, item V, says that \\"Are conditions for eligibility: V - party affiliation.\\" However, the Proposal Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) no. 6/2015, authored by independent senator Jos√© Reguffe, would allow the independent candidacy of individuals who have the support of at least 1% of the electors able to vote in the region (city, state or country, depending on the election) in which the candidate is running. Currently, members of the legislature can leave their respective parties after being elected, as in the case of senator Reguffe, who left the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) in 2016. Bulgaria The President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev is an independent with support from the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Radev was elected in the 2016 election. Canada Independent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of Independent Liberal or Independent Conservative MPs into the 1950s. Today, election as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties. Candidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with \\"Independent\\" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent. Independent politicians have on occasion held considerable sway in the House of Commons of Canada in recent years, as Canada has been governed by successive minority governments with independent Members of Parliament (MPs) sometimes sharing in the balance of power. In the 2004 federal election, Chuck Cadman was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the British Columbia riding of Surrey North. Independent Andr√© Arthur was elected in the Quebec riding of Portneuf‚ÄîJacques-Cartier in the 2006 federal election, and was the only independent to win a seat in that election; he was re-elected in the 2008 federal election. MP Bill Casey, who had been expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 budget, also ran as an independent in 2008 and retained his seat. In the 2019 federal election, MP Jody Wilson-Raybould ran as an independent candidate in the riding of Vancouver Granville after being expelled from the Liberal Party over the SNC- Lavalin affair. She was returned to Parliament with 32% of the vote. The territorial legislatures of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are consensus governments with no political parties. All members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other provincial and territorial legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the 2009 British Columbia general election, independent candidate Vicki Huntington narrowly defeated incumbent Attorney General Wally Oppal in Delta South. Croatia After an inconclusive election in 2015, Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá was named the first non-partisan Prime Minister of Croatia. Finland After serving six years on his first term as President of Finland in the National Coalition Party from 2012 to 2018, Sauli Niinist√∂ was elected for his second term in 2018 after running as an independent candidate. France In France, independent politicians are frequently categorised as sans √©tiquette (\\"without label\\") in municipal or district elections. In the nineteenth-century and first half of the twentieth century, most French national politicians were independents. The first modern French political parties date from the early 1900s (foundation of Action Lib√©rale and the Radical Party). The first legislation on political parties dates from 1911, though it was not until 1928 that parliamentarians were required to select a political party for the parliamentary register (either by formally joining a group, or by loosely working with one as an apparent√©, or associate), and not until after 1945 that structured political parties came to dominate parliamentary work. Once elected, independents tended to attach themselves to a parliamentary party. In some cases independent deputies banded together to form a technical group of their own. In 1932, for instance, there were four technical groups created: the left-of-centre Independent Left, with 12 deputies; the centre-right liberal Independents of the Left, with 26 deputies; the right-wing agrarian Independents for Economic, Social and Peasant Action, with six deputies; and the far-right monarchist Independent Group, with 12 deputies - these four technical groups thus accounted for one-tenth of deputies. In addition, the larger parliamentary parties, including the socialist SFIO, centre-left PRRRS, centre-right ARD and conservative FR all included a greater or lesser number of independents who sat with their group for parliamentary work (apparent√©s). In 1920, Alexandre Millerand was elected president of the Republic under the banner \\"without label\\". However, it is nowadays rare to have independent politicians at national level, if only because independents usually affiliate themselves to an existing political grouping. Noteworthy independents include Jos√© Bov√© in the 2007 presidential election. Emmanuel Macron was an independent politician as Minister, but formed his own party to stand in the 2016 presidential election. From 2001 to 2008 \\"without label\\" was no longer used in the nomenclature of the Ministry of the Interior. Candidates and lists presenting themselves as \\"without label\\" are classified in DVG (various left), DVD (various right), DVC (various center) or AUT (other) according to their political sensitivity. Therefore, from 2008 onwards, the DIV (miscellaneous) or the LDIV code for the \\"miscellaneous\\" list has been created to group unclassifiable or categorical interests and, by default, mayors without a declared label claiming no political sensitivity, be it left, center or right. The AUT (other) grade replaces the DIV grade without changing its definition. Georgia Salome Zourabichvili won the 2018 Georgian presidential election as an independent candidate, becoming the first-ever female President of Georgia. Germany Joachim Gauck, President of Germany from March 2012 to March 2017 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, was to date the most prominent independent politician. In the German presidential election of 2010 he was the candidate of the Social Democrats and Greens, in 2012 the candidate of all major parties except The Left. His presidency‚Äîthough his powers are limited‚Äîconstitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since World War II. It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without any chances of election by the Federal Convention was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer Luise Rinser. In the Bundestag parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of personalized proportional representation (since 1949) allows any individual holding the passive right to vote to stand for a direct mandate in the electoral districts‚Äî299 of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a plurality voting system. Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first Bundestag election in 1949 saw three independents elected; since then, no party- independent candidate has won a seat.Unabh√§ngige Direktkandidaten , last seen October 13th, 2012. At state level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a Landtag legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in local elections it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to districts', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a city council or even mayor, especially in Northern Germany. In recent years, independents have formed Free Voters associations which have had success in local governments. Two such associations have managed to enter state parliaments: the Free Voters of Bavaria in 2008 and the Brandenburg United Civic Movements/Free Voters in 2019. An independent member of parliament, who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of fraktionsloser Abgeordneter, i.e. not affiliated to any parliamentary group. A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes fraktionslos. In 1989 the Bundestag MP Thomas W√ºppesahl, who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a fraktionsloser Abgeordneter, for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the Federal Constitutional Court decided partially in his favor. After the German unification of 1871, the first Reich Chancellors (heads of government) de jure served as executive officers of the German Imperial states as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the Weimar period after World War I, several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliation: these chancellors were Wilhelm Cuno (1922‚Äì1923), Hans Luther (1925‚Äì1926), the former Centre politician Franz von Papen (1932), and Kurt von Schleicher (1932‚Äì1933). The last two cabinets appointed by Reich President Paul von Hindenburg, a non-partisan (though strongly Conservative) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the Nazi Party; many of the ministers were not party members. Since World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though \\"on the ticket\\" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister Hans Leussink (1969‚Äì1972), and Minister of Economy Werner M√ºller (1998‚Äì2002). Minister of Justice Klaus Kinkel only shortly after his appointment joined the Free Democrats in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, whose affiliation with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU party chairman in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by Der Stern magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949.Stern: Ludwig Erhard war nie CDU-Mitglied , April 25th, 2007, last seen August 7th, 2012. Hong Kong More than half of Hong Kong's Legislative Council is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in functional constituencies, and are not rare among geographical constituencies. Iceland The President of Iceland (currently Gu√∞ni Th. J√≥hannesson) is independent. India Independent candidates can contest elections on the basis of their personal appeal or to promote an ideology different from any party.No independent candidate has ever been the President or Prime Minister. Independents currently hold 6 seats in the Indian Parliament. Ireland In Ireland, proportional representation, the comparative looseness of formal parties, and strong local sentiment have meant that independents have formed a significant part of the parliamentary landscape since the foundation of the state: in the early elections to D√°il √âireann (parliament), independents accounted for 7% of seats in 1922, 8.5% in 1923, 10.5% in 1927, and 9% in 1932, though with the development of relatively more structured parties their numbers declined thereafter. These were similar proportions to the number of independents elected to other interwar European democracies such as France (see above). It was not until the 2010s that independents would see a similar electoral success, with record scores for independents surpassing the previous interwar highs. After the Irish general election in 2016, there were 19 independent TDs (parliamentary deputies) in the D√°il (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 12% of the total. Two technical groups were formed by independent deputies to coordinate their activities: the Independents4Change, with four deputies, opposed the government, while the Independent Alliance formed part of the minority government's working majority. A number of other individual independents similarly supported the government, and received cabinet positions. There are fourteen independent senators in the 25th Seanad (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 23% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the National University of Ireland and two from Dublin University. There are also five independent senators who were nominated by the Taoiseach and four elected by the technical panels. Israel The only Israeli politican elected to the Knesset by his own was Shmuel Flatto-Sharon. Italy The Prime Ministers Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (1993‚Äì1994), Lamberto Dini (1995‚Äì1996), Giuliano Amato (2000‚Äì2001), Mario Monti (2011‚Äì2013) and Giuseppe Conte (2018‚Äìpresent) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the President of the Italian Republic between 1999 and 2006. President Sergio Mattarella, despite being a former member of the Christian Democracy and of the Democratic Party, was elected president in 2015 as an independent. Kosovo Atifete Jahjaga was elected the first female and Independent President of Kosovo. She was also the first female and independent elected leader in the whole of the Balkans. Malaysia Independents have rarely been elected to the Dewan Rakyat and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast. Independent Senators are quite rare. In 2010, a group of independent MPs who were sacked from the People's Justice Party formed a political block called Konsensus Bebas.Formation of KONSENSUS BEBAS (media statement) The members were Zahrain Mohamed Hashim (Bayan Baru), Wee Choo Keong (Wangsa Maju), Zulkifli Noordin (Kulim-Bandar Bharu), Tan Tee Beng (Nibong Tebal) dan Mohsin Fadzli Samsuri (Bagan Serai). It did not last beyond the 12th General Elections. , three independent MPs were elected in GE14, but later joining Pakatan Harapan (PKR), thus causing no representation for independent MP for that time. However, as of June 2018 and December 2018, the number increased to 13 independent Members of Parliament that now currently sit in the Dewan Rakyat as of December 2018. At the same time in December 2018, almost all members from Sabah UMNO quit the party and became independent politicians. Mexico Jaime Heliodoro Rodr√≠guez Calder√≥n (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname \\"Bronco\\", is a Mexican politician who is the current governor for the northern state of Nuevo Le√≥n and holds no political party affiliation. elected Governor for Nuevo Le√≥n, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country. New Zealand Originally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties, starting at the end of the 19th century, considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since 1943, although two independent candidates have been successful in by-elections (in all cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such. The last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was Winston Peters, who won the in electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the National Party. By the time of the next general election, he had formed his own party (New Zealand First), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co- found their own parties, with varying levels of success ‚Äî examples include Peter Dunne, Taito Phillip Field, Gordon Copeland, Tau Henare, and Alamein Kopu. Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as Frank Grover and Tuariki Delamere. There were two independent MPs in the 49th New Zealand Parliament; Chris Carter and Hone Harawira. Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the Labour Party's leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the MƒÅori Party and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party, Mana and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There were also two other parties which had only a single MP: United Future with Peter Dunne and ACT with David Seymour. Neither Dunne nor Seymour was classed as an independent ‚Äî Dunne's presence in Parliament was due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence was as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the . In the 50th New Zealand Parliament there was one independent MP: Brendan Horan, a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets. Peter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re- registered. Niue In Niue, there have been no political parties since 2003, when the Niue People's Party disbanded, and all politicians are de facto independents. The government depends on an informal coalition. Pakistan Pakistan also has independent politicians standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has General Elections, 2008 elected 30 Members. In the 2011 four candidates won seats in the National Assembly. In the 2013 General Election nine seats were won by independents. Philippines Noli de Castro, the Philippines' former vice president, ran as senator in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition Pwersa ng Masa coalition but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran as vice president as a guest candidate of the administration K-4 coalition and won with just under majority of the vote. Starting in 2001, several senators had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the 15th Congress, there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the 2007 Senate election when Gregorio Honasan (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier elected in 1995 as an independent candidate and being adopted by the Nationalist People's Coalition-led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since Magnolia Antonino in 1967, although Antonino was a guest candidate of the Liberal Party then. In the local level, former priest Eddie Panlilio was elected as governor of Pampanga in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated. In the 2010 House of Representatives elections, seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections. In contesting elections, independent candidates, while can spend as much as those with parties can under the law, they aren't able to tap in spending from a political party that nominated them. Poland The Polish Sejm is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although since 2001 there has been a possibility to create non-partisan Voters' Electoral Committee (pol. KWW, komitet wyborczy wyborc√≥w); they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g. Kukiz'15, or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold. National minorities candidates also form Voters' Electoral Committees (like German Minority Electoral Committee, represented in Sejm since 1991), but they do not have to reach the nationwide threshold. However, during a Sejm term many members switch parties or become independents. Tickets such as Civic Platform during the 2001 election were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now. The situation in the Senate is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. In the last parliamentary election (2015) four independents won seats in the Senate. Three Presidents since 1990 have technically been independents. Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the Solidarity and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki). Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski was a leader of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, who was the first leader of Law and Justice, Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski (PO) and Andrzej Duda (PiS). The resignation is required because the Constitution says that the president shall hold no other offices nor discharge any public functions. The aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party). Portugal Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the current president of Portugal since 6 March 2016, was elected on 24 January 2016 while being a leading member of the Social Democratic Party, but suspended his political affiliation on the day of his swearing-in. Russia All of Russia's Presidents have been independents. Former president Dmitry Medvedev declined an offer to join United Russia, saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party. Vladimir Putin, the current president of Russia, was the head of the United Russia party until 26 May 2012, but even then was not its member, thus formally was and still is independent. Sweden The Swedish election system is based on parties nominating candidate MPs for their party ballots, and each party has to receive 4% or more of the national vote (or 12% in one region, which has never happened). This makes running as an independent MP impossible. Once elected, the seat is personal; MPs may resign their party membership, or be stripped of it, while retaining their Riksdag seats to become independent to become what is commonly referred to as a politisk vilde (political savage) symbol: (-). In the executive branch, there is no requirement for ministers to be MPs, or even have a political affiliation (though this has overwhelmingly been the case in modern times). This means that even the prime minister could technically be an independent if chosen by the Riksdag. Taiwan After the 2018 Taiwanese local elections, there is only one independent local head: * Ko Wen-je, Mayor of Taipei. In 2019, Ko Wen-je founded the Taiwan People's Party, so there is no independent local head at the moment. United Kingdom The Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved parliaments and assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent annibynol) or no ballot paper description at all (this latter choice was used, for example, by David Icke at the 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election). Some groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties. Some English examples are the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern, the Epsom and Ewell Residents Association, the Devizes Guardians, the Derwentside Independents, and the East Yorkshire Independents. =House of Commons= Before the twentieth century it was fairly common for independents to be elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, but there have been very few since 1945. S. O. Davies, a veteran Labour MP, held his Merthyr Tydfil seat in the General Election of 1970, standing as an independent, after he had been deselected by the Labour Party. Journalist Martin Bell was elected at Tatton in the general election of 1997, having stood on an anti-corruption platform, defeating incumbent Neil Hamilton. He was the first independent to be newly elected to the Commons since 1951.Martin Bell's 1997 election was the first election of an Independent in the UK since 1951: He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001. At the 2001 General Election, Dr Richard Taylor of the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern party was elected for the constituency of Wyre Forest. Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest at the 2005 General Election, becoming the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term. Two independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the 2005 election, although both were defeated five years later. In the same election, Peter Law was elected as an independent at Blaenau Gwent. Law died on 25 April 2006: the resulting by-election elected Dai Davies of the local party Blaenau Gwent People's Voice. The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent. Only one independent was elected to the Commons in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 elections: Sylvia Hermon, the member for North Down, a Unionist who left the Ulster Unionist Party because of its links with the Conservatives. There have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included Mike Hancock (formerly a Liberal Democrat), Eric Joyce (formerly Labour) and Nadine Dorries, a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time. Independent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without success. An example from the 2001 general election was Aston Villa supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the Sutton Coldfield constituency in protest at the way chairman Doug Ellis ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the Salisbury constituency, is Arthur Uther Pendragon, a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of King Arthur. Other independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the Labour Party but before the Respect Coalition was founded, British Member of Parliament (MP) George Galloway described himself as \\"Independent Labour\\". On 23 March 2005 the Independent Network was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election. The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections. It has an organic set of principles which are known as the Bell Principles and are very closely related to Lord Nolan's Standards of Public Life. The Independent Network does not impose any ideology or political influence on their candidates. In March 2009, the multi- millionaire Paul Judge established the Jury Team, an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections. Independent and undescribed candidates Part II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 allows individuals who wish to stand as a candidate to all parliaments and assemblies in the UK, including the House of Commons, the right to use one of three ballot paper descriptions. Those descriptions are the name of a registered political party; the word \\"independent\\" or the Welsh equivalent; or no description at all, leaving the ballot paper description box blank. Unless a candidate stands as \\"independent\\" or as a \\"No Description\\" candidate leaving the ballot paper description box blank, their candidature must be confirmed by a signed certificate from the relevant officer from a registered political party, as set out in Section 52 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006. =House of Lords= The House of Lords includes many peers independent from political parties. Some are simply not affiliated with any grouping, whilst another, larger, grouping is given the official designation of crossbenchers. Additionally the Lords Spiritual (bishops of the Church of England) do not have party affiliations. =Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Irish Assembly= In the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections, three MSPs were elected as Independents: Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West), Dr Jean Turner (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) and Margo MacDonald (Lothians). In 2004 Campbell Martin (West of Scotland region) left the Scottish National Party to become an independent and in 2005 Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) left the Conservative Party to become an independent. At the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections Margo MacDonald was again returned as an independent MSP and was elected as an independent for the third time four years later. She died in 2014 while still serving as member of the Parliament. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, there could be no by-election and her seat remained vacant until the 2016 election. Peter Law was expelled from the Labour Party after standing against an official Labour candidate in Blaenau Gwent at the 2005 UK general election and became an independent in the National Assembly and UK Parliament. In 2006 Peter Law died from a brain tumour and his wife, Trish Law campaigned and took the seat as an independent candidate at the sequent by-election and held onto the seat again in the 2007 Welsh Assembly elections. In 2016, Nathan Gill as the then leader of UKIP Wales defected from the group to sit as an independent after a falling out with Neil Hamilton who was elected UKIP Assembly group leader. Dafydd Elis-Thomas left the Plaid Cymru group later in 2016 after multiple fallings out with Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. Elis-Thomas said his reason for leaving Plaid Cymru was that it not serious about working with the Welsh Labour Government. Neil McEvoy was expelled from Plaid Cymru on 16 January 2018 and is now sitting as an independent AM. Nathan Gill stood down on 27 December 2017 and was replaced by Mandy Jones. Mandy Jones left the UKIP group on 9 January 2018 over a fallout over her staff. =Local elections= The introduction of directly elected mayors in several parts of England has witnessed the election of independents to run councils in Stoke-on-Trent, Middlesbrough, Bedford, Hartlepool and Mansfield. The first Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was first elected as an independent, having run against the official Labour candidate Frank Dobson. He was subsequently re-admitted to the Labour Party in December 2003 before his first re-election campaign. Independent candidates frequently stand and are elected to local councils. There is a special Independent group of the Local Government Association to cater for them. A number of local authorities have been entirely or almost entirely composed of independent members, such as the City of London Corporation, the Isles of Scilly Council, Orkney Islands Council, Shetland Islands Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) in the Outer Hebrides. Roughly a quarter of the police and crime commissioners elected in England and Wales in the 2012 election were independents. United States =President= George Washington is the only President elected as an independent to date. President Washington opposed the development of political parties, which had begun to solidify as the Federalist faction centered around Vice President John Adams and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and the Democratic-Republican faction centered around Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Washington feared that partisanship would eventually destroy the country, and famously warned against \\"the baneful effects of the spirit of party\\" in his 1796 Farewell Address. John Tyler was expelled from the Whig Party in September 1841, and effectively remained an independent for the remainder of his presidency. He later returned to the Democratic Party and briefly sought re-election in 1844 as a National Democrat, but withdrew over fear he would split the Democratic vote. Since 1900, notable candidates running as independents for U.S. president have included liberal Republican congressman John Anderson in 1980, billionaire entrepreneur Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, former Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 1996 and 2000 elections, and \\"Never Trump\\" conservative candidate Evan McMullin in 2016. Out of all independent candidates since Washington, Perot received the best performance, gaining no votes in the Electoral College but receiving 19 percent of the popular vote and at earlier points in the election season leading in polls against his opponents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. Additionally, McMullin received 21 percent of the popular vote in his home state of Utah but received little support from the remainder of the country. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders ran in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, but ultimately did not appear on the ballot in the 2016 presidential election, though he did receive 5% of the vote as a write-in candidate in his home state of Vermont. In 2008, Nader formed Independent Parties in New Mexico, Delaware, and elsewhere to gain ballot access in several states. This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for federal races, including Joe Lieberman (Connecticut for Lieberman). =Governor= Illinois, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Alaska and Minnesota have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors, Shadrach Bond and Edward Coles; James B. Longley in 1974 as well as Angus King in 1994 and 1998 from Maine; Lincoln Chafee in 2010 from Rhode Island; Julius Meier in 1930 from Oregon; Sam Houston in 1859 from Texas; and Bill Walker in 2014 from Alaska. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as an A Connecticut Party candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees. Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is Jesse Ventura, who actually ran as a member of the Reform Party's Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the Independence Party of Minnesota. In 1971, State Senator Henry Howell of Virginia, a former Democrat, was elected lieutenant governor as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for governor as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes. There were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In Maine, state legislator Barbara Merrill (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In Texas, country music singer and mystery novelist Kinky Friedman received 12.43% of the vote, and State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties. In 2010, Florida governor Charlie Crist left the Republican party and became Independent (He later became a Democrat.) rather than face former state house Speaker Marco Rubio in the Republican primary for Senate (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek). In 2014, former Honolulu mayor Mufi Hannemann ran as an independent candidate for the governorship of the State of Hawaii after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. As a result, Democratic candidate David Ige was elected as governor with a plurality of 49%. =Congress ‚Äì House of Representatives and Senate= There have been several independents elected to the United States Senate throughout history. Notable examples include David Davis of Illinois (a former Republican) in the 19th century, and Harry F. Byrd Jr. of Virginia (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century. Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as Wayne Morse of Oregon. Nebraska senator George W. Norris was elected for four terms as a Republican before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican Kenneth S. Wherry in 1942. Vermont senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's change of party status was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50-50 between the Republicans and Democrats (with a Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the Congressional elections in 2002, when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat. Dean Barkley of the Independence Party of Minnesota was appointed a day before the 2002 elections to fill the senate seat of Paul Wellstone who, while running for re-election, died weeks prior. Barkley refused to caucus with either party. Senator Bernie Sanders is the longest-serving independent member of Congress in American history. He was an independent member of the United States House of Representatives for Vermont-at-large from 1991 to 2007. Sanders later won the open Senate seat of Jim Jeffords as an independent. Joe Lieberman is a former Democrat who, like Lowell P. Weicker Jr., ran under a third party (Connecticut for Lieberman Party) in the 2006 election. Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they often caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress, both caucusing with the Democrats. In 2012 Angus King was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine. , he has typically caucused with the Democrats. The United States House of Representatives has also seen a handful of independent members. Examples include Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Virgil Goode of Virginia, Frazier Reams of Ohio, Victor Berger of Wisconsin, and Justin Amash of Michigan. =State and local offices= In August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from Kentucky, one from Oregon, one from Tennessee, and one from New Mexico. The representatives came from the states of Louisiana (two), Maine (two), Vermont (two), and Virginia (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator Joseph Carraro left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection. In November 2005, Manny Diaz was elected Mayor of Miami, Florida as an independent. On June 19, 2007, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent. Oscar Goodman, Mayor of Las Vegas, Nevada switched his affiliation to Independent from Democrat in December 2009. Dan Hollingsworth has won four consecutive elections as an Independent since 1998 for mayor of the small city of Ruston, Louisiana, the home of Louisiana Tech University. In 2017, Maine State Representative Ralph Chapman, a Democrat, changed his registration to Maine Green Independent Party, which is the Maine chapter of the Green Party of the United States, giving the Green Party a seat in Maine's State Legislature. The Nebraska Legislature is unique in that it is the only nonpartisan state legislature. In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is unicameral), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections. Members are allowed to register with political parties but choose not to reveal their affiliation while seated, as a professional courtesy. However, the political affiliation of party-affiliated members are considered open secrets and the parties exist in the legislature on an unofficial basis. Some members, such as Ernie Chambers of Omaha, are independent of party officially, while others have not publicly disclosed their affiliation. North Korea Parliamentary independent candidates: The system in place whither the DPRK allows for unserious independent politicians to launch their own campaigns to gain a seat in parliament. The candidates however must be approved by the Fatherland Front, being the primary party of the DPRK. To cast votes to independent candidates the voting population must do so at independent voting stations. At the stations Korean people can debate extensively on which independent candidates would do the best for the Korean country. Nearly all electoral systems currently in practice in the DPRK that exist on a local level are made up of mostly independent Candidates. As the Fatherland Front and other major party's primarily operate in the urban heartland of the DPRK. These independent candidates will enjoy substantial debating in front of their local populations, before a vote is made. On the local level of North Korean elections, alliances between independent candidates is banned.

Independents reached particular prominence between 1642 and 1660, in the period of the English Civil War and of the Commonwealth and Protectorate, wherein the Parliamentary Army became the champion of Independent religious views against the Anglicanism or the Laudianism of Royalists and the Presbyterianism favoured by Parliament itself. The Independents advocated freedom of religion for non-Catholics. History During the First Civil War, the Parliamentary cause was supported by an alliance of Anglicans who supported Parliamentary traditions, Presbyterians and Independents. During the period leading up to the war and during its early years, the Presbyterian party under the leadership of John Pym was in the ascendant. However, as was shown in the outcome of negotiations for an alliance with the Presbyterian Scots over the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643, the Independents party were strong enough to prevent Presbyterianism being imposed on them. After the formation of the New Model Army the strength of the Independents grew along with the fortunes of the Army because Independents held many of the senior positions within the Army (Oliver Cromwell being the most famous of them). In 1648, at end of the Second Civil War the Independents in the Army were strong enough to remove from Parliament all those who opposed them in what has become known as Pride's Purge. After Pride's Purge, the so-called Rump Parliament of around fifty Independent MPs sanctioned the trial and execution of King Charles I in January 1649 and the creation of the republican English Commonwealth. The Independents dominated English politics for the next decade, until shortly before the Restoration. After the Restoration, the English Parliament was dominated by Anglicans, supporters of both the Parliamentary and Royalist causes, who imposed the Clarendon Code. Combined with the Test Act, this excluded all nonconformists from holding civil or military office, and prevented them from being awarded degrees by the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Many nonconformists later migrated to the North American colonies.

The Lion Rock Institute describes itself as Hong Kong's first independent free-market think tank. According to the Institute's website, it was created \\"to ensure that freedom and prosperity would continue to thrive in Hong Kong\\". It is one of the institutions supported by the Atlas Network.  History  The Institute was founded in August 2004 by founders Simon Lee, Andrew Work, and Andrew Shuen.  Political stance  The Lion Rock Institution describes itself as \\"independent\\". Academic and democracy activist Joseph Cheng regards the Institution as politically neutral.  Activities  The Lion Rock Institution's political activities have been pro-free market. It opposed to an increase of tobacco tax in Hong Kong as proposed by the Hong Kong Government in 2009. The Lion Rock Institute is active in a range of aspects of Hong Kong society, especially broadcasting and telecom, town planning, transportation, house and redevelopment, fiscal management, competition law, social mobility, minimum wage, education, health care, and financial services. It does not concern itself with foreign policies or those concerning mainland China. The Institute has been quoted on a number of these issues by newspapers and media outlets in Asia.

An independent is variously defined as a voter who votes for candidates on issues rather than on the basis of a political ideology or partisanship;Sorauf and Beck, Party Politics in America, 1988. a voter who does not have long-standing loyalty to, or identification with, a political party;Flanigan and Zingale, Political Behavior of the American Electorate, 1988.Wolfinger, \\"The Promising Adolescence of Campaign Surveys,\\" in Campaigns and Elections American Style, 1995. a voter who does not usually vote for the same political party from election to election;Key, The Responsible Electorate, 1966.DeVries and Tarrance, The Ticket Splitter, 1972. or a voter who self-describes as an independent.Campbell, Converse, Miller and Stokes, The American Voter, 1960. Voting systems outside of the United States, including the British parliamentary system, may include independent voters as being \\"floater voters\\" or swing votes. Definition The definition of an \\"independent voter\\" is controversial and fraught with implications. The earliest concept of independents is of a person whose political choices, by definition, were made based on issues and candidates (due to lack of party affiliation). Furthermore, early studies of voting behavior conclusively demonstrated that self-identified independent voters are less interested in specific elections than partisan voters, poorly informed about issues and candidates, and less active politically. However, a contrary view emerged: The independent usually voted on the basis of deeply ingrained beliefs, attitudes and loyalties, and is more like the strongly partisan voter than any other voter (or the idealized \\"independent\\").Keith, Magleby, Nelson, Orr, Westlye, and Wolfinger, The Myth of the Independent Voter, 1992.Petrocik, \\"An Analysis of Intransitivities in the Index of Party Identification,\\" Political Methodology, Summer 1974.Hershey, Party Politics in America, 2007.Dennis, \\"Political Independence in America, Part I: On Being an Independent Partisan Supporter,\\" British Journal of Political Science, January 1988. By the 1960s, scholars attempted to define the independent based on behavior, rather than party identification or loyalty. Focusing on ticket splitters, these studies depicted an independent voter who had the same level of political interest as strong partisans and who voted largely based on the issues with which they strongly agreed and/or disagreed. However, by focusing on voting behavior, this definition of the independent ignored non-voters. Critics claimed that the independent voter is merely a subset of the larger set of independents, which should also include non-voters. Studies also found that voting and not- voting is deeply affected by the particular candidate running in an election. Voting, therefore, is more reflective of what candidate is running‚Äîand therefore a poor measure of partisanship.Ladd and Hadley, \\"Party Definition and Party Differentiation,\\" Public Opinion Quarterly, Spring 1973.Brody and Page, \\"Comment: Assessment of Policy Voting,\\" American Political Science Review, June 1972; Fiorina, Retrospective Voting in American National Elections, 1981; Page and Jones, \\"Reciprocal Effects of Policy Preferences, Party Loyalties and the Vote,\\" American Political Science Review, December 1979. More recently, scholars focused on self-identification as a good measure of a person's political independence. The value of self-identification as a measure of a person's political independence or partisanship is that it is seen as a proxy for the behavior which should be exhibited by the independent voter. Additionally, self-identification could be easily captured either with a nominal question (\\"Do you self-identify with an existing political party?\\", a question which is answered with a \\"yes\\" or a \\"no\\"), or by a structured ordinal question (\\"Generally speaking, do you consider yourself a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or what?\\").Backstrom and Hursh-C√©sar, Survey Research, 1981. The first analyses of this measure of political independence found that there were significant differences between those individuals who self-identified as \\"independent\\" and those who listed \\"no preference\\" as to party identification.Miller and Wattenberg, \\"Measuring Party Identification: Independent or No Partisan Preference?\\", American Journal of Political Science, February 1983. Individuals who expressed \\"no preference\\" usually exhibited low levels of interest in politics, low levels of knowledge about the candidates and issues, low frequency of voting, and less confidence in their ability to influence politics.More recent research has found that individuals expressing \\"no preference\\" but who have moderate to high levels of political interest behave more like those self-describing themselves as \\"independents\\" than they do others who self-describe as \\"no preference.\\" Wattenberg, The Decline of American Political Parties, 1952-1996, 1998. Although some scholars continue to conclude that self-description is the best measure of partisanship or independence, a number of studies have found debilitating problems with this measure. The nature of the voter registration system and the appearance of the ballot, the way the question reinforces a unidimensional interpretation of the political arena, the measure's failure to function in a multi-party political system, the measure's confusion of the theoretical relationship between partisanship and the intent to vote, question wording errors which confuse a social group with a political party, failure to predict policy (versus candidate) preferences, question order, and failure to measure partisanship accurately when there are sizeable differences in party size all confound accurate measurement of partisanship and independence using this measure.Finkel and Scarrow, \\"Party Identification and Party Enrollment: The Difference and the Consequences,\\" Journal of Politics, June 1985; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler, Partisan Hearts and Minds, 2004; Clarke and Kornberg, \\"Support for the Canadian Progressive Conservative Party Since 1988: The Impact of Economic Evaluations and Economic Issues,\\" Canadian Journal of Political Science, March 1992; Converse and Pierce, \\"Partisanship and the Party System,\\" Political Behavior, September 1992; Alvarez, \\"The Puzzle of Party Identification: Dimensionality of an Important Concept,\\" American Politics Research, October 1990; Bishop, Tuchfarber, and Oldendick, \\"Change in the Structure of American Political Attitudes: The Nagging Question of Question Wording,\\" American Journal of Political Science, May 1978; Bartle, \\"Improving the Measurement of Party Identification in Britain,\\" in British Elections & Parties Review, 1999.Johnston, \\"Party Identification Measures in the Anglo-American Democracies: A National Survey Experiment,\\" American Journal of Political Science, May 1992.Survey question order is still a vexacious issue. Some studies conclude it biases results, and creates a survey artifact which shows large numbers of independents. See: Heath and Pierce, \\"It Was Party Identification All Along: Question Order Effects on Reports of Party Identification in Britain,\\" Electoral Studies, June 1992. Other studies conclude that survey order has no effect. See: McAllister and Watternberg, \\"Measuring Levels of Party Identification: Does Question Order Matter?\\", Public Opinion Quarterly, Summer 1995.Some studies draw the conclusion that a unidimensional concept of partisanship is nevertheless accurate. See: Green, \\"On the Dimensionality of Public Sentiment Toward Partisan and Ideological Groups,\\" American Journal of Political Science, August 1988. Even the nature of a survey instrument as a measure of partisanship and independence has been called into question.In one study, scholars found wide differences in survey respondents' abilities to recall political ideologies and apply them to questions about how they feel about policy issues of the day. Independents, it was suggested, have a lower level of ability to apply ideological tools of assessment to policy issues. The survey instrument, with its focus on making snap judgments, may therefore falsely measure the level of political independence. See: Huckfeldt, Levine, Morgan, and Sprague, \\"Accessibility and the Political Utility of Partisan and Ideological Orientations,\\" American Journal of Political Science, July 1999. Terminology There are several synonyms for the term independent voter. In the U.S. state of Massachusetts, a registered voter who chooses not to enroll in a political party or designation is termed unenrolled. In the U.S. state of Florida, a registered voter who chooses not to affiliate with a political party is termed no party affiliation (NPA). Partisan influence To many scholars, independence seemed the flip- side of partisanship. Identifying the variables which are significant in creating partisanship would, therefore, identify the variables which are significant in creating political independence. Subsequently, a very large body of scholarship has emerged which has attempted to analyze partisanship. Parents appear to be a primary source of political socialization and partisanship. Much of the theoretical basis for this hypothesis emerged from the fields of child psychology and social learning, which studied the ways in which children are socialized and values inculcated in them. Studies of political partisanship have found that partisanship is strongest when both parents have the same political loyalties, these loyalties are strong, both parents have similarly strong party loyalties, and parental partisanship accords with socio-economic status (for example, the wealthy are Republicans or the poor are Labour supporters).Beck and Jennings, \\"Parents As 'Middlepersons' in Political Socialization,\\" Journal of Politics, February 1975; Hess and Torney, The Development of Political Attitudes in Children, 1967; Beck and Jennings, \\"Family Traditions, Political Periods, and the Development of Partisan Orientations,\\" Journal of Politics, August 1991.Bandura, Social Learning Theory, 1977; Chaffee, McLeod and Wackman, \\"Family Communication Patterns and Adolescent Participation,\\" in Socialization to Politics: A Reader, 1973.Niemi and Jennings, \\"Issues and Inheritance in the Formation of Party Identification,\\" American Journal of Political Science, November 1991.Achen, \\"Parental Socialization and Rational Party Identification,\\" Journal of Political Behavior,June 2002.Knoke and Hout, \\"Social and Demographic Factors in American Political Party Affiliations, 1952-72,\\" American Sociological Review, October 1974.Giles and Hertz, \\"Racial Threat and Partisan Identification,\\" American Political Science Review, June 1994.Campbell, \\"The Young and the Realigning: A Test of the Socialization Theory of Realignment,\\" Public Opinion Quarterly, Summer 2002. Social groups are another source of partisanship. Friends, relatives, and neighbors often have the same partisan loyalties and strengths as one's parents. The more homogeneous the social group, the more likely the individual will be to develop strong partisan loyalties. When social group homogeneousness is low, the individual is likely to be less strongly socialized into partisan politics and more likely to seek a different party loyalty (whether by disengaging from partisanship or switching partisan loyalties).Goldberg, \\"Social Determinism and Rationality As Bases of Party Identification,\\" American Political Science Review, March 1969; Huddy, \\"From Social to Political Identity: A Critical Examination of Social Identity Theory,\\" Political Psychology, March 2001; Greene, \\"Understanding Party Identification: A Social Identity Approach,\\" Political Psychology, June 1999.Finkel and Opp, \\"Party Identification and Participation in Collective Political Action,\\" Journal of Politics, May 1991. Life-cycle and generational effects also contribute to partisanship. Initially, studies indicated that the operative variable was the \\"life-cycle.\\" That is, a person's partisan attachments naturally grew stronger over time as weak socialization became strong and strong socialization became stronger. Additionally, theorists suggested that older voters favored certain policy preferences (such as strong government pensions and old-age health insurance) which led them to (strongly) favor one party over another.Converse, The Dynamics of Party Support, 1976. Later studies showed that the initial strong effect of the life-cycle variable was mitigated by generational effects. Party identification seemed strongly affected by certain formative generational events (such as the Civil War, the Great Depression or the social upheaval of the 1960s). Several studies concluded that generational effects were distinct from life-cycle effects, and that both factors were significant in creating (or not) partisanship.Abramson, \\"Developing Party Identification: A Further Examination of Life-Cycle, Generational, and Period Effects,\\" American Journal of Political Science, February 1979; Claggett, \\"Partisan Acquisition vs. Partisan Intensity: Life-Cycle, Generational, and Period Effects,\\" American Journal of Political Science, June 1981; Jennings and Markus, \\"Partisan Orientations over the Long Haul: Results from the Three-Wave Political Socialization Panel Study,\\" American Political Science Review, December 1984; Cassel, \\"A Test of Converse's Theory of Party Support,\\" Journal of Politics, August 1993; Billingsley and Tucker, \\"Generations, Status and Party Identification: A Theory of Operant Conditioning,\\" Journal Political Behavior, December 1987; Wong, \\"The Effects of Age and Political Exposure on the Development of Party Identification Among Asian American and Latino Immigrants in the United States,\\" Political Behavior, December 2000.Shively, \\"The Development of Party Identification Among Adults: Exploration of a Functional Model,\\" American Political Science Review, December 1979.Norpoth and Rusk, \\"Partisan Dealignment in the American Electorate: Itemizing the Deductions Since 1964,\\" American Political Science Review, September 1982.Some scholars claim there is no life-cycle variable in determinants of partisanship. See: Abramson, \\"Generational Change and the Decline of Party Identification in America: 1952-1974,\\" American Political Science Review, June 1976. But if generational events affected partisanship, some scholars hypothesized that lesser political, social, and economic issues might as well. Conceding that major \\"shocks\\" such as the Great Depression could realign or dealign partisanship, some scholars reasoned that a series of smaller shocks over time could also dramatically influence the direction and strength of partisanship. Many scholars became convinced that partisanship was not bedrock but shifting sand. Important childhood events (such as becoming aware of a presidential campaign) as well as events in adulthood (such as recessions, war, or shifting racial policies) could also affect the level of partisanship.Sears and Valentino, \\"Politics Matters: Political Events as Catalysts for Preadult Socialization,\\" American Political Science Review, March 1997; Valentino and Sears, \\"Event-Driven Political Socialization and the Preadult Socialization of Partisanship,\\" Political Behavior, July 1998; Franklin and Jackson, \\"The Dynamics of Party Identification,\\" American Political Science Review, December 1983. The concept of \\"retrospective voting\\"‚Äîin which the voter makes political judgments based on the party-in-power's performance over the past few years‚Äîdeeply influenced studies of partisanship.Fiorina, Retrospective Voting in American National Elections, 1981.Clarke and Suzuki, \\"Partisan Dealignment and the Dynamics of Independence in the American Electorate, 1953-88,\\" British Journal of Political Science, January 1994.Allsop and Weisberg, \\"Measuring Change in Party Identification in an Election Campaign,\\" American Journal of Political Science, November 1988. Applying the concept of retrospectiveness to partisanship, more recent analyses have concluded that retrospective and prospective political party success play a significant role in the direction and strength of partisanship.Lockerbie, \\"Party Identification: Constancy and Change,\\" American Politics Research, December 2002; Lockerbie, \\"Change in Party Identification: The Role of Prospective Economic Evaluations,\\" American Politics Research, July 1989; Brody and Rothenberg, \\"The Instability of Partisanship: An Analysis of the 1980 Presidential Election,\\" British Journal of Political Science, October 1988.Carmines, McIver, and Stimson, \\"Unrealized Partisanship: A Theory of Dealignment,\\" Journal of Politics, May 1987.Some disagree that retrospective assessments affect partisanship. The rise of independent voting is less a product of dissatisfaction with political parties than it is the increasing irrelevancy of political parties in the modern electoral process, which is focused on mass communication and candidates rather than parties. See: Miller and Wattenberg, \\"Measuring Party Identification: Independent or No Partisan Preference?\\", American Journal of Political Science, February 1983. Both repeated \\"minor shocks\\" and retrospective/prospective assessments of political party success are micro- level, rather than macro-level, variables.Carsey and Layman, \\"Changing Sides or Changing Minds? Party Identification and Policy Preferences in the American Electorate,\\" American Journal of Political Science, April 2006. That is, while very important in creating political independence, they affect individuals only. For example, John may come to believe that Party A is no longer effective and become an independent. Yet, Mary may come to the conclusion that Party A is still effective. Both voters see the same successes and failures, but their retrospective and prospective calculus of success varies. This has led some scholars to conclude that independence is not the flip-side of partisanship. Rather, partisanship and political independence may be two distinct variables, each of which must be measured separately and using different theoretical constructs.Kamieniecki, Party Identification, Political Behavior, and the American Electorate, 1985. Other scholars have concluded that the causal direction of partisanship must be questioned. While it has long been assumed that partisanship and the strength of partisanship drive attitudes on issues,Jacoby, \\"The Impact of Party Identification on Issue Attitudes,\\" American Journal of Political Science, August 1988. these scholars conclude that the causal relationship is reversed. Increase of independent voters =In the United States= Using the self-identification method of measuring political independence, surveys found an increasing number of independent voters beginning in 1966. In 1952, when modern polling on the issue began, the number of independent voters nationwide was 22 percent. By 1976, the number had risen more than half, to 36 percent of the electorate. Regionally, the rise of the independent voter was even more apparent. In the non-Deep South, the number of independent voters had risen from 22 percent to 37 percent. But in the Deep South, the number of independents rose steeply from 14 percent in 1952 to 32 percent in 1976 (and would rise even further, to 35 percent, by 1984).Norrander, \\"Explaining Cross-State Variation in Independent Identification\\", American Journal of Political Science, May 1989.Beck, \\"Partisan Dealignment in the Postwar South,\\" American Political Science Review, June 1977. Although the number of self-identified independents has fallen slightly in the 1990s and 2000s, about 30 percent of American voters still say they are independents (as measured by self- identification).Abramson, Aldrich and Rohde, Change and Continuity in the 2004 Elections, 2005; Ambinder, \\"A Nation of Free Agents\\", Washington Post, September 3, 2006. But by other measures, the number of independents has not increased at all. Several analyses conclude that (whether through survey error or misconceptualization of the nature of political independence) the number of independent voters has remained relatively unchanged in the United States since the 1950s. Reasons In the United States, voter identification as an independent varies widely across regions as well as states. Inter-party competition, the organizational strength of each party, electoral variables (such as the ease of voter registration, voting procedures, the timing of primaries and elections, etc.), and even turnout seem to greatly affect the number of independents in a state. The effect of these variables is not uniform across all the states, either. = In Europe = In the British parliamentary system, a similar concept of a \\"floating voter\\" is used to describe voters who can change their voting alignment and freedom from political parties. This term may also be applied in referendum votes, such as in the vote for \\"Brexit\\". Dutch politics also uses the term floating voter to describe party non-affiliation. = In Iran = There is a large swing vote in Iran, known as \\"Party of the Wind\\" (), or \\"grey vote\\" (), which can be rapidly excited. Impact Because independent voters do not have strong affectional ties to political parties, scholars who adhere to the self-identification method for measuring political independence theorize that independents may be more susceptible to the appeals of third-party candidates. It has also been suggested that the more independent voters, the more volatile elections and the political system will be. Others hypothesize that the amount of ticket- splitting will increase, leading to greater parity between the strongest political parties, an increase in the number of minor political parties (particularly \\"down-ballot\\" in state, county or local races), or possibly even a breakdown in the political party system. However, scholars who hold to the behavioral measure of determining political independence point out that there has been little change in the level of ticket-splitting since the initial upsurge in the 1950s. They also point out that, when independents who strongly lean toward one party are included in the same group as that party's strong partisans, there has also been little change in party loyalty since the 1950s. For example, partisan Republicans and independents who lean Republican tend to vote for Republican candidates just as frequently in the 1990s as they did in the 1950s. Indeed, in the United States, the tendency of both strong and weak partisans to vote a straight ticket in down-ballot races is even stronger than it is for presidential and congressional races. Many scholars also point out that partisanship is only one of many variables which predict voting choice. A decline in partisanship may have little to no impact on election outcomes, and much depends on fluctuations in these other factors.Miller, \\"Party identification, Realignment, and Party Voting: Back to the Basics,\\" American Political Science Review, June 1991. =Realigning elections= For more than half a century, the concept of a realigning election‚Äîa dramatic shift in the electoral coalition supporting the existing political system‚Äîhas been an important one in political theory. First enunciated by V. O. Key, Jr. in 1955,Key, \\"A Theory of Critical Elections,\\" Journal of Politics, February 1955. the theory of realigning elections suggested that certain \\"critical elections\\" created sudden, massive shifts in the electorate. The political party and policies of the status quo were changed, and a new governing coalition installed which would rule for decades until the next critical election. The theory of critical elections fit well with what scholars knew about generational effects and the emerging literature on \\"major shocks\\" as a variable in determining the existence, direction, and strength of partisanship. It also helped explain the radical shifts in national politics which occurred irregularly in American history. Scholars also hypothesized that realigning elections rejuvenated public support for the political system, which helped explain the relative stability of American political structures.Burnham, Critical Elections and the Mainsprings of American Politics, 1971; Sundquist, Dynamics of the Party System: Alignment and Realignment of Political Parties in the United States, 1983; Rosenof, Realignment: The Theory that Changed the Way We Think About American Politics, 2003; Miller, \\"Party identification, Realignment, and Party Voting: Back to the Basics,\\" American Political Science Review, June 1991; Norpoth and Rusk, \\"Electoral Myth and Reality: Realignments in American Politics,\\" Electoral Studies, June 2007; Abramowitz and Saunders, \\"Ideological Realignment in the U.S. Electorate,\\" Journal of Politics, August 1998; Paulson, Realignment and Party Revival: Understanding American Electoral Politics at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century, 2000; Tubbesing, \\"Predicting the Present: Realigning Elections and Redistributive Policies,\\" Polity, Summer 1975; Pomper, \\"The Classification of Presidential Elections,\\" Journal of Politics, August 1967; Pomper, Voter's Choice: Varieties of American Electoral Behavior, 1983. In time, scholars refined the theory somewhat. The concept of \\"secular realignment\\" was developed to account for gradual shifts in politics which had similar effects (eventually) to a critical realigning election. Some studies concluded that \\"secular realignment\\" came in short, jerky, periods called \\"punctuations.\\"Key, \\"Secular Realignment and the Party System,\\" Journal of Politics, May 1959; Campbell, \\"The Revised Theory of Surge and Decline,\\" American Journal of Political Science, November 1987; Campbell, \\"Party Systems and Realignments in the United States, 1868-2004,\\" Social Science History, Fall 2006.Bullock, Hoffman, and Gaddie, \\"Regional Variations in the Realignment of American Politics, 1944-2004,\\" Social Science Quarterly, September 2006. Initially, the concept of a realigning election was monolithic, that is, the effects were believed to be national in effect. But beginning in the 1980s, political scientists began to conclude that realigning elections could occur on sub-national levels (such as regions or even within states).Nardulli, \\"The Concept of a Critical Realignment, Electoral Behavior, and Political Change,\\" American Political Science Review, March 1995; Cowden, \\"Southernization of the Nation and Nationalization of the South: Racial Conservatism, Social Welfare and White Partisans in the United States, 1956-92,\\" British Journal of Political Science, April 2001. But with the \\"rise of the independent voter\\" and no realigning election, scholars developed the theory of the \\"dealigning election.\\" In the dealigning election, all political parties lose support as partisanship decreases and political independence rises. Split-ticket voting and issue-oriented voting increase, leading to political volatility. Divided government (one party controls the executive branch, while another controls the legislature) becomes the norm.Chubb and Peterson, \\"Realignment and Institutionalization,\\" in New Directions in American Politics, 1985; Clubb, Flanigan and Zingale, Partisan Realignment: Voters, Parties, and Government in American History, 1990; Ladd, \\"The 1994 Congressional Elections: The Postindustrial Realignment Continues,\\" Political Science Quarterly, Spring 1995; Lawrence, \\"On the Resurgence of Party Identification in the 1990s,\\" in American Political Parties: Decline or Resurgence?, 2001. A number of scholars have dismissed the theory of realignment and dealignment, however. They argue that the concept is vague and the data do not support mass change in electoral behavior.Mayhew, Electoral Realignments, 2004; Ladd, \\"Like Waiting for Godot: The Uselessness of 'Realignment' for Understanding Change in Contemporary American Politics,\\" in The End of Realignment? Interpreting American Electoral Eras, 1991. The large number of qualifications which must be made to the theory of critical elections has rendered it useless, it is argued.Putz, \\"Partisan Conversion in the 1990s: Ideological Realignment Meets Measurement Theory,\\" Journal of Politics, November 2002. The theory of secular realignment has been particularly criticized. The replacement of elderly voters (who die) with a new generation of voters (who come of age and are eligible to vote) is normal, not a unique and irregular \\"punctuation\\" or \\"surge,\\" it is claimed.Carmines and Stimson, \\"Issue Evolution, Population Replacement, and Normal Partisan Change,\\" American Political Science Review, March 1981. Still other scholars claim there are no regional dealignment variationsWeakliem and Heath, \\"Regional Differences in Class Dealignment: A Comment on Johnston and Pattie,\\" Political Geography, November 1995. while others argue that the concept of realignment and dealignment is no longer useful in an era in which political parties are no longer very important in the political system.Shea, \\"The Passing of Realignment and the Advent of the 'Base-less' Party System,\\" American Politics Research, March 1999. =Impact of dealignment= Scholars argue that political parties play a critical supportive role in democracies. Parties regulate the type and number of people seeking election, mobilize voters and enhance turnout, and provide the coalition-building structure essential for office-holders to govern. Parties also serve as critical reference groups for voters, framing issues and providing and filtering information. These functions, it is claimed cannot otherwise be accomplished, and democracies collapse without them. Only political parties serve these roles.Sabato and Larson, The Party's Just Begun: Shaping Political Parties for America's Future, 2001; Aldrich, Why Parties?: The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America, 1995; Hetherington and Keefe, Parties, Politics, and Public Policy in America, 2006; Maisel, The Parties Respond: Changes in American Parties and Campaigns, 2002; Smith, Party Influence in Congress, 2007; Eldersveld and Walton, Political Parties in American Society, 2000; Reichley, The Life of the Parties, 2000; McSweeney and Zvesper, American Political Parties, 1991; Green and Coffey, The State of the Parties: The Changing Role of Contemporary American Parties, 2006; Green and Herrnson, Responsible Partisanship?: The Evolution of American Political Parties Since 1950, 2003; Buckley, Parties and Elections in America: The Electoral Process, 2004; Sinclair, Party Wars: Polarization and the Politics of National Policy Making, 2006; Pomper, Voters, Elections and Parties: The Practice of Democratic Theory, 1988. Dealignment‚Äîthe rise in the number of independent voters‚Äîhas an extremely deleterious effect on democracy, these scholars claim. Dealignment leads to the rise of candidate-centered elections in which parties and ideologies play little part. Without parties, candidates rely ever-more heavily on mass media for communication, political action committees (PACs) for funds, special interest groups for staff, and political consultants for expertise. The increasing reliance on mass communication leads to a withering of political discourse as the sound bite and an emphasis on the horse-race aspect of politics becomes the norm. This limits the amount and kind of information the public receives, leading to less choice for voters. When voters can stay at home and watch television rather than participate in civic life, the public no longer perceives the need to become involved in democracy‚Äîand so the civic life of the democracy withers. As PACs and interest groups become more important, the number of people speaking to the public, providing political information and different political choices and views, declines. Additionally, PAC and interest group spokespeople may not be representative of the public or the groups they claim to speak for, creating disenfranchisement of various (often minority) groups. As independent voting and ticket-splitting rise, parties seek to insulate themselves from the whipsaw effect of elections. The power of incumbency becomes increasingly important, and accessibility by the public declines. Parties seek increasingly moderate positions in order to stay electorally viable, further limiting political choice (\\"both parties look and sound the same\\"). As the parties distance themselves from the average voter and seem to offer limited policy options, dealignment worsens. As ideology plays less and less a part in elections, it becomes more and more difficult for parties to forge coalitions of like-minded officeholders. Governmental deadlock becomes common, further encouraging independent voting as citizens perceive \\"their\\" party to be ineffective. As ticket-splitting rises, divided government becomes the norm, making it even more difficult for office-holders to enact and implement policies. Politics becomes increasingly volatile, with first one party and then another governing. Although parties once held politicians accountable for their actions, their increasing irrelevance in politics leads to a decline in accountability (and thus even less responsiveness and less democracy). The \\"Imperial Presidency\\" becomes more important, since single officeholders with great power become the only politicians capable of governing.Dalton, McAllister, and Wattenberg, \\"The Consequences of Partisan Dealignment,\\" Parties Without Partisans, 2001.Lilleker, Key Concepts in Political Communication, 2006; Putnam, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, 2001; Prior, Post-Broadcast Democracy: How Media Choice Increases Inequality in Political Involvement and Polarizes Elections, 2007; Holbert, \\"Television News Viewing, Governmental Scope, and Postmaterialist Spending: Assessing Mediation By Partisanship,\\" Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, December 2005; Levine, Presidential Campaigns and Elections: Issues and Images in the Media Age, 1995; Hart, Seducing America: How Television Charms the Modern Voter, 1998; King, The New American Political System, 1990; Fiorina, Divided Government, 1992; Thurber and Nelson, Campaigns and Elections American Style, 2004; Hart, Campaign Talk, 2000; Berry and Wilcox, The Interest Group Society, 2006; Buckley, Parties and Elections in America: The Electoral Process, 2004; Smith, Party Influence in Congress, 2007; Wattenberg, The Rise of Candidate-Centered Politics: Presidential Elections of the 1980s, 1991; Mackay, Essentials of American Politics, 1999. Other scholars have concluded that dealignment has not harmed democracy. Political parties have adapted to the realities of large numbers of independent voters, it is argued. The candidate-centered election has actually revitalized parties, and led to new party structures and behaviors which have allowed parties to survive in the age of mass communication.Sabato and Larson, The Party's Just Begun: Shaping Political Parties for America's Future, 2001; Aldrich, Why Parties?: The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America, 1995; Maisel, The Parties Respond: Changes in American Parties and Campaigns, 2002; Green and Herrnson, Responsible Partisanship?: The Evolution of American Political Parties Since 1950, 2003; Sinclair, Party Wars: Polarization And the Politics of National Policy Making, 2006. A minority view, however, suggests that the evidence for a resurgence of political parties too equivocal, and that scholars lack the theoretical concepts to make such judgments.Fiorina, \\"Parties and Partisanship: A 40-Year Retrospective,\\" Journal of Political Behavior, June 2002. Yet another strain of thought has concluded that \\"realignment\\" is occurring. The slow \\"secular realignment\\" is not yet over, these scholars say. Regional differences in the level and impact of dealignment simply point up the fact that major shifts in political coalitions are occurring. Slowly but surely, these studies conclude, realignment is happening and will be obvious within a generation. These scholars argue that the surge in independent voters which began in the 1960s has ended, and that there are distinct signs that partisanship is on the rise again.

The date and place of Nikitaras' birth are disputed, but he is thought to have been born either in the village of Nedoussa (ŒùŒ≠Œ¥ŒøœÖœÉŒ±) in the Peloponnesian province of Messenia or in Leontari in Arcadia circa 1784. He was a nephew of Theodoros Kolokotronis, the most important Greek military leader of the Revolution.

When the Greek war of Independence began, both returned to the mainland. He was with Kolokotronis, who commanded the Greek army at the Siege of Tripoli early in the war. When the commander and his men tried to escape the city, Nikitaras and his troops cut off the escape of the Turkish commander and his troops and slaughtered them. Nikitas achieved fame and his sobriquet \\"Turk-Eater\\" in the Battle of Dervenakia, where he is said to have used five swords: four broke from excessive use. During the civil war within the Revolution, he sided with his uncle against the faction around Alexander Mavrokordatos.A. S.

The house in which Nikitaras was forted up during the Battle of Doliana, has been transformed into a museum Nikitaras was a strong patriot, not corrupt like many of the leaders of the Revolution. When Ioannis Kolettis asked him to kill a rival, Odysseas Androutsos, in exchange for a government position, Nikitaras refused the offer and became angry with Kolettis. He also refused to take booty after battle, a normal practice of Balkan irregulars at the time.A. S.

He was also a strong campaigner for the rights of those who fought in the Revolution. Nikitaras was released from prison in 1841, but the period in jail broke his health and he died in 1849 in Piraeus. He is especially famous for his words during the Third Siege of Missolonghi. When he arrived in the city with supplies, soldiers, who had not been paid in months, asked him if he had brought any money. Nikitaras, angry, flung down his sword, a weapon taken from a Turk he had killed, uttering the words: \\"I have only my sword, and that I gladly give for my country.\\" Nikitaras is remembered in the poem by Nikos Gatsos, \\"The Knight and Death\\".

Located in the southern section of the Wind River Range (or \\"Winds\\" for short), the cirque is a very popular destination for technical rock climbers. Climber Orrin Bonney gave the area its current name in 1941 after his survey of the cirque. Prior to this, few if any visitors had ventured into the cirque due to the remote location. The cirque is an almost circular hole or valley carved by a glacier that retreated over 8,000 years ago. As is true with the rest of the Winds, the mountains are composed almost entirely of granite. The Continental Divide spans the crest of the main peaks. The towers average lower in altitude than the highest mountains in the northern Winds, with Lizard Head Peak () being the tallest. Other individual mountains in the cirque include Shark's Nose, Warbonnet, Warrior Peak, Wolf's Head and Pingora Peak. There are hundreds of routes to choose from in difficulties ranging from 5.1 to 5.11a and since the mountains are composed primarily of granite rock, there is good anchoring. These climbs include two featured in Steck and Roper's Fifty Classic Climbs of North America the Northeast Face of Pingora (IV, 5.9) and the East Ridge of the Wolf's Head (III, 5.6). For both the climber and backpacker, access to the cirque from the west from Pinedale, Wyoming requires a drive, partly paved and partly gravel, to the Big Sandy trailhead. There is a small National Forest campground at the trailhead. An hike beginning at above sea level is relatively level the first and becomes very steep the last mile (1.6 km) and ascends to Jackass Pass at , crossing the continental divide. From there one must descend a steep half mile (800 m) to Lonesome Lake, which is one of four lakes in the cirque. Expect the trail to be busy in July and August as the cirque is the most popular hiking and climbing destination in the Wind River Range. Lonesome Lake was the first lake in the Wind River Range whose water was deemed unfit for consumption due to human waste and consequently, no camping is permitted within a quarter mile (400 m) of the lake. The granitic rocks allow poor filtration of ground water and the ability of many alpine lakes to cleanse themselves is often poorer than one might find at lower altitudes. Hazards Encountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures. Importantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range.

On 1 November 1570, the Domeinraad council in Bergen op Zoom had warned the dijkgraafs of the south and north quarters of a \\"very excessive high flood\\" \\"considering those big storms of wind starting yesterday\\". A long period of storm pushed the water to unprecedented heights, even higher than those at the flood disaster of 1953. It broke innumerable dikes on the Dutch coasts, as a result of which there were enormous floods and immense damage. The total number of dead is thought to have been in the tens of thousands, but exact data is not available. Tens of thousands of people became homeless. Livestock was lost in huge numbers. Winter stocks of food and fodder were destroyed. The Allerheiligenvloed marks the origin of the Verdronken Land van Saeftinghe (verdronken = \\"drowned\\").

(2014) The role of REE3+ in the crystallization of lanthanites. Mineralogical Magazine, 78, 1373‚Äì1380. DOI: 10.1180/minmag.2014.078.6.03 The lifetime of this rare-earth bearing precursor as well as the kinetics of crystallization of the various REE-lanthanites are dependent on the specific trivalent rare- earth ion involved in the reaction. The times needed for lanthanites to fully crystallize increase linearly with the ionic potential of the trivalent rare- earth ion (La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+) present in their structure. The differences in these ion sizes and ionic potential as well as differences in dehydration energy of the trivalent rare-earth ions control the lifetime of the poorly ordered precursor and thus also the crystallization kinetics of the lanthanites. Furthermore, they also affect the structural characteristics (e.g. unit-cell dimensions and standard shape) of the crystals.

It was derived from the German World War II BMW 018 design, and developed by ex-BMW engineers through a progression of more powerful models. The name is derived from its original design group, Atelier technique a√©ronautique de Rickenbach near Lindau within the French Occupation Zone of Germany. The Atar powered many of the French post-war jet aircraft, including the Vautour, √âtendard and Super √âtendard, Super Myst√®re and several models of the Mirage.Gunston 1989, p. 160. History =Background= Hermann Oestrich's team in charge of the development of the BMW 003 engine had moved to the town of Stassfurt, near Magdeburg, in February 1945. An underground production factory was being set up in a salt mine outside town by C.G. Rheinhardt in a desperate attempt to continue engine production in face of the now overwhelming Allied air campaign. This mine is well known historically as it was also being used for the storage of uranium compounds as part of the Nazi atomic bomb program. The town of Stassfurt surrendered to US forces on 12 April 1945, and Oestrich hid much of the technical data in a local cemetery. The next day a ten-man team made up primarily of engineers from Pratt & Whitney arrived, and he handed the data over to them. Production restarted for US use while the war ground to a close, and the US forces cleared out the factory while they waited to turn the area over to the Soviets. Oestrich had by this time moved to Munich for further interrogation, and from there to England at the request of British engine designer Roy Fedden. He had them work on the design of a turboprop engine for a proposed C-54 Skymaster-class four- engine transport. While working on this design, ≈êstrich was secretly approached by French DGER agents with an offer to take up further design of the 003 in France. The French forces had found a number of BMW 003 turbojet engines in their occupation zone after the war, and were interested in setting up a production line. These discussions had not progressed very far when ≈êstrich was allowed to return to Munich, only to be brought back to England in late August, then returned to Munich again where the US offered him and a hand-selected team jobs in the US, but without their families. √ñstrich instead accepted the French invitation, and by September had been set up at the former Dornier factories in Rickenbach in the French Zone. very close to the northern border of Switzerland. Here they were soon joined by other former BMW engineers, as well as those from a number of other German firms, bringing the team to about 200 members. The group was named the Atelier Technique A√©ronautique Rickenbach (Rickenbach Aeronautical Technical Workshop in French), or ATAR. They had re-engineered the 003 design as the ATAR 101 (model R.101) by October, and granted a production contract on the proviso that actual production would be carried out in France. In January a further five- year contract was offered to the entire team, including protected wages, provisions for their families, few travel restrictions, and the possibility of French citizenship. The contract was signed on 25 April 1946, and the drawings for the ATAR 101 were sent to SNECMA for production. =ATAR 101= The first engine took some time to assemble. The first parts were available as early as May 1946, but a complete compressor or turbine was not ready until the middle of the next year. The first complete engine finally ran on 26 March 1948. By April 5 it had been brought up to thrust and was continually improved until it reached by October. During this time a new turbine made of solid high- temperature steels replaced the earlier air-cooled models, allowing for better aerodynamic shaping and an improved compression ratio. By January 1950 several additional engines had joined the program, bringing the total running time to over 1,000 hours, and a thrust of , making it among the most powerful engines of the era. The BMW 003 that it was developed from provided only , less than a third of the Atar. The ATAR 101B introduced Nimonic turbine blades\\"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines ‚Äì 5th edition\\" by Bill Gunston, Sutton Publishing, 2006, P.216 and more stator blades as well as a number of changes to fix minor problems seen in the earlier experimental models. The first B model passed a 150-hour endurance test in February 1951 at . A flight test followed on 5 December 1951 in the Dassault Ouragan, and starting on 27 March 1952, under the wings of a Gloster Meteor F.4. After delivering the initial production run of B models, the Atar 101C used an improved compressor and combustion chamber, raising the thrust to . The Atar 101D featured a slightly larger turbine with new high-temperature alloys that allowed the exit temperature to rise to 1,000 ¬∞C and the thrust to . The D model also included a new exhaust consisting of a long pipe ending in a nozzle with two \\"eyelid\\" shutters in place of the earlier fore/aft moving cone on the inside, a feature of the WW II Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow turbojet, which was known as the Zwiebel (onion) from its shape. The Atar 101E added a \\"zeroth\\" compressor stage, raising the overall pressure ratio to 4.8:1 and the thrust to , surpassing the projected thrust of 34.3 kN (7,700 lbf)of the German BMW 018 turbojet still being developed in 1945. Various Atar 101 models were tested on a wide variety of aircraft. An afterburner was incorporated into the D model to produce the Atar 101F of , while the same addition to the E model produced the ATAR 101G. These were flight tested on the Dassault Myst√®re II in August 1954, but they did not see production on this aircraft. Their first success was on the Dassault Super Myst√®re which first flew under Rolls-Royce Avon power on 2 March 1955, and followed by the 101G powered version on 15 May 1956. Production started in 1957 with a contract for 370 aircraft, but this was later cut back to 180 in light of the performance of the Dassault Mirage III which was then undergoing testing. =Atar 08 and 09= With the Atar 101 now sitting at the low end of the power scale, in 1954 SNECMA started the design of a more radical upgrade, the Atar 08. Overall design and dimensions were similar to the 101, but the new engine included a nine-stage compressor in place of the earlier seven-stage one, and a smaller two-stage turbine to power it. There were many detail improvements as well, including the replacement of the original compressor rotor with a new one made of magnesium alloy. The first Atar 08 B-3 produced and had a slightly improved overall pressure ratio of 5.5:1. A new and much improved afterburner was designed for the engine, resulting in the Atar 09. It was first tested in January 1957 at , and was soon improved to . A further improved afterburner with an eighteen- flap nozzle in place of the two eyelids of the earlier designs was introduced on the 09C model in December 1959. This version also featured a new starter from Microturbo. The Atar 9D replaced the exhaust and afterburner area with one made of titanium that allowed continual operation at Mach 2, up from the C's 1.4. Air cooling was re-introduced for the Atar 9K models, further improving overall performance, and especially fuel economy. With the Atar 8 and 9 series, the long ten years of development had finally resulted in a successful commercial design. Thousands were produced for a variety of aircraft, including the √âtendard and Super √âtendard strike aircraft, Mirage III, Mirage 5 and Mirage F1 fighters, the Mirage IV bomber, and a variety of test aircraft. =Super Atar= In 1955 the French government started a project to explore flight speeds up to Mach 3.0. SNECMA began studies on an engine to power it, initially consisting of the compressor design of the existing Atar 101, but replacing all of the light alloys with steels in order to handle the increased operating temperatures. This also demanded the use of an air-cooled turbine, similar to the ones from the earliest prototypes. Such an engine, the M.26, ran in May 1957, giving 47 kN (10,364 lbf) without an afterburner. Further improvements led to the M.28, which ran in September 1958 at 52 kN (11,466 lbf). This work led to the Super Atar design of 85 kN with afterburning. This version also included variable stators, which were in the process of being widely introduced in the industry. However, the project to build the test aircraft, the Griffon III, never went ahead and SNECMA ended development of the Super Atar in 1960. =Other developments= The Atar design was also used for a variety of larger, smaller, and experimental developments. Of particular note are the R.104 Vulcain, a scaled-up Atar, and the much smaller R.105 Vesta. Both engines were developed in parallel to the Atar in the early 1950s in order to fill particular performance niches, the Vulcain for the Myst√®re IV D, and the Vesta for a variety of designs. None of these entered production, however; the Myst√®re IV D was cancelled, and the Vesta lost out to the Turbom√©ca Gabizo, which was also abandoned. Description The original Atar 101 featured a seven-stage axial compressor using aluminum alloy blades attached to an aluminum rotor. The front bearing was held in place by four vanes, with the \\"left\\" one as seen from the front containing a power takeoff shaft. One unique feature of the Atar designs was the separate Atar 5000 accessories section, which could be mounted in front of the engine, driven by an extension shaft. The combustion area consisted of twenty steel flame cans arranged in a \\"canular\\" layout, exiting into the single-stage turbine. Early models were 2.85 m long, 0.9 m in diameter, and weighed 850 kg, while The C models and on were 3.68 m lone including the long extension, 0.89 m in diameter, and weighed 940 kg. Later versions were generally similar to the C model, although the inclusion of the afterburner increased lengths to 5.23 m, and weights varied from 925 to 1,240 kg depending on the model. The Atar 8 and 9 used a 9-stage compressor similar to the 101, but including a steel first stage in order to improve resistance to foreign object damage. The turbine included two stages. Length and width remained the same as the 101 models, deliberately, but weights further increased up to 1,350 kg for the 9B.

History Wrangler Brutes were formed around vocalist Sam McPheeters (ex-Born Against, Men's Recovery Project), drummer Brooks Headley (ex-Born Against, Universal Order of Armageddon, [Young] Pioneers), guitarist Andy Coronado (of Skull Kontrol, Monorchid, Nazti Skinz, Glass Candy) and bassist Cundo Bermudez (of Nazti Skinz and Fast Forward). The band sold over 1,000 copies of their self-released, self-titled cassette in nine months. This release was followed by a 7\\" record and a full-length LP, Zulu, recorded in May 2004 with Steve Albini. The album featured Chris Thomson (of Monorchid and Circus Lupus fame), as well as Circle Jerks' Keith Morris on vocals. The band recorded their October 8, 2004, show at Monkey Mania in Denver, Colorado, with Permanent Record Studios. The concept was to release a \\"bootlegged\\" live version of their Zulu album, but due to the band's split the live CD was never released. In December 2004, at the end of a lengthy Japanese tour, McPheeters bowed out and was replaced for the band's last US show by Dean Spunt of the bands Wives and No Age. The band was known for somewhat confrontational, hectic live performances which were heralded by their biggest fans as a return to the artsy yet entertaining briskness of early Los Angeles hardcore punk. McPheeters' sense of humor dominated their presence as a live act; his patter, alternately caustic and cryptic, was a major aspect of these shows. On their first tour, their set ended with noted history buff McPheeters donning a wig and reciting a dramatic monologue taken from the closing scene of act 1 of Shakespeare's Henry V.

He was active in the non-Marxist wing of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) during the Weimar Republic. He attempted to formulate the theoretical foundations of the social-democratic relations to the state, and nationalism. He was politically active in the relatively conservative Hofgeismarer Kreis of the SPD and is believed to have authored the group's statement of principles. Gertrud Falke (left) Heller was born in Teschen, Austrian Silesia. In World War I he volunteered for the army, served in an Austro-Hungarian artillery regiment and got a heart disease at the front. In 1921 Heller was married to the dancer Gertrud Falke (daughter of famed German poet Gustav Falke). They had three children, Jane, Ruth, and Lukas. Lucy Heller, Bruno Heller Emily Heller, and Zoe Heller are his grandchildren. In 1928 Heller had a short relationship with Elisabeth Langg√§sser. Their daughter, Cordelia, was born in 1929. In his short life, he was involved in a number of political debates and controversies, most notably with Hans Kelsen, Carl Schmitt and Max Adler. In short, Heller's theories are both a reinterpretation of Hegelian social theory and an emendation of Bernstein's revisionism. Heller calls for the integration of the working class in the social, cultural and political structures of the nation-state. Against Carl Schmitt he argued that it is not so much the state of emergency, but rather the state of social and political stability which defines the sovereign. He is generally perceived to have been a major influence on Carlo Schmid who, in turn, drafted most of the German Constitution and was the main force behind the reform of the SPD. Heller was forced to go into exile in 1933 with his wife and children, and died in Madrid in the same year, leaving his Magnum Opus, the Staatslehre, unfinished. His collected works, in three volumes, have been published by the Mohr Verlag of T√ºbingen. Recently, there is a renewed interest in Heller's work, especially in Germany. Some of his work has been translated in English. His views have been influential in both Japan and the Spanish-speaking world.

They are known as \\"Aydƒ±nlƒ±k√ßƒ±lar\\" (Clarifiers) due to their daily newspaper Aydƒ±nlƒ±k (\\"Clarify\\" or \\"Enlightenment\\") that has a circulation of 63,000.http://www.medyatava.net/tiraj.asp During a general assembly on 15 February 2015, the Workers' Party was rebranded and changed its name to Patriotic Party, with Perin√ßek remaining as leader. Overview The ƒ∞P traditionally combined Maoist rhetoric with a hardline Kemalism. Although they accept scientific socialism as their main ideology, they have a more patriotic ideology than other left-wing parties in Turkey. Their revolutionary strategy is based on \\"National Democratic Revolution\\", which is close to Mao Zedong's \\"New Democratic Revolution\\". ƒ∞P supports Stalin's \\"Socialism in One Country\\" thesis, rather than Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev's \\"national communism\\" thesis. Such that, Mehmet Bedri G√ºltekin, deputy chairman of the party, wrote a book on Sultan-Galiev's counter-revolutionary role. They admire the founder of the Turkish republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk (who is considered a \\"left-wing bourgeois democratic revolutionary\\" by Chairman Perin√ßek ) as much as they admire Marxist revolutionary leaders like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. They also promote alliances with nations they believe have anti- imperialist tendencies (such as Venezuela, Brazil and Cuba) and oppose the existence of American expansionism - (such as India, China and Russia). ƒ∞P states that a brotherhood based solution to the Kurdish question must exclude imperialist initiative in the Middle East. They claim that the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has been completely under the control of the USA since the Gulf War. ƒ∞P asserts that it is still possible to unite Turkish and Kurdish people in Turkey within the borders of an anti-imperialist nation state which will be established through a democratic revolution. According to them, separatism became a tool of American imperialism in breaking national markets in the Third World in post-Cold War conditions. Although they traverse separation, they also defend democratic rights and freedoms of Kurds in Turkey. For ƒ∞P, the key tool to solve the Kurdish problem is to demolish \\"feudal structures\\" in Kurdish provinces and make peasants \\"free citizens\\".

Commonwealth Though the first official Polish government service entrusted with espionage, intelligence and counter- intelligence was not formed until 1918, Kingdom of Poland and later the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth had developed networks of informants in neighbouring countries. Envoys and ambassadors had also gathered intelligence, often using bribery. Such agents included the 17th-century Polish poet Jan Andrzej Morsztyn. Polish kings and Polish‚ÄìLithuanian military commanders (hetmans) such as Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski maintained intelligence networks. The hetmans were responsible for intelligence-gathering in the Ottoman Empire, its vassal states and disputed territories such as Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania. Intelligence networks also operated in Muscovy and among the restless Cossacks. In 1683, during the Battle of Vienna, the Polish merchant- spy Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki secured a promise of military assistance for Vienna, besieged by the Turkish forces of Kara Mustafa Pasha, and thus facilitated the victory of a Christian European coalition led by Polish King Jan III Sobieski. Kulczycki is reported to have received as reward for his services the Turks' supplies of coffee beans and to have established Vienna's first coffee house. Partitions During the period when Poland had been partitioned (beginning in 1772, until 1918) by three adjacent empires, intelligence played an important role in patriotic Poles' surveillance of their occupiers and in their planning and conduct of successive Polish uprisings. 1914‚Äì1918 In 1914 J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski created the Polish Military Organization, an intelligence and special-operations organization which worked alongside the Polish Legions. As such, it was independent of Austro-Hungary and loyal to Pi≈Çsudski and to a future independent Poland. 1918‚Äì1921 Immediately upon achieving independence in 1918, Poland established armed forces. Reflecting the influence of the French Military Mission to Poland, the Polish General Staff was divided into divisions entrusted with specific tasks: # Oddzia≈Ç I (Division I) ‚Äì Organization and mobilization; # Oddzia≈Ç II (Division II) ‚Äì Intelligence and counterintelligence; # Oddzia≈Çu III (Division III) ‚Äì Training and operations; # Oddzia≈Ç IV (Division IV) ‚Äì Quartermaster. Division II (colloquially, \\"Dw√≥jka,\\" \\"Two\\") was formed in October 1918, even before Poland had declared her independence. Initially called the \\"General Staff Information Department,\\" Division II was divided into sections (sekcje): * Sekcja I ‚Äì Reconnaissance and close intelligence; * Sekcja II ** IIa (East) ‚Äì Offensive intelligence for Bolshevik Russia, Lithuania, the Belarusian People's Republic, Ukraine and Galicia; ** IIb (West) ‚Äì Offensive intelligence for Austria, Germany, France and the United Kingdom; * Sekcja III ‚Äì General intelligence and surveillance abroad (East and West); * Sekcja IV ‚Äì Preparation of a front-line bulletin; * Sekcja V ‚Äì Contacts with military and civilian authorities; * Sekcja VI ‚Äì Contacts with attach√©s in Berlin, Vienna, Budapest, Moscow and Kiev; * Sekcja VII ‚Äì Ciphers (i.e., cryptology). An extensive network of domestic and foreign informants developed rapidly. This was due to Poland's poor economic situation, itself the result of over a century of foreign occupation. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Poland's economic and political situation had forced hundreds of thousands to emigrate. With the advent of Polish independence, many √©migr√©s offered their services to Polish intelligence agencies. Others Poles who had been living in the former Russian Empire and were now making their way home through war-torn Russia, provided priceless intelligence on the logistics, order of battle and status of the parties in the Russian Civil War. In Western Europe (especially in Germany, France and Belgium) the Polish diaspora often formed the backbone of heavy industry; some one million people of Polish descent lived in the Ruhr Valley alone. Many of these provided intelligence on industrial production and economic conditions. After the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War in early 1919, intelligence from the east proved vital to Poland's survival against a far superior enemy. A separate organization was formed within Polish Intelligence, taking over most intelligence duties for the duration of the war. This was a Biuro Wywiadowcze (Intelligence Bureau) comprising seven departments: # Organisation; # Offensive Intelligence \\"A\\"; # Offensive Intelligence \\"B\\"; # Offensive Intelligence \\"C\\"; # Defensive Intelligence; # Internal propaganda; # Counterintelligence. The fourth department, Offensive Intelligence \\"C\\", became the most developed because it carried out all the duties connected with \\"front-line\\" reconnaissance and intelligence, as well as \\"long-range\\" intelligence and surveillance in countries surrounding Bolshevik Russia, including Siberia (still in the hands of the White Russians), Turkey, Persia, China, Mongolia and Japan. The third department, Offensive Intelligence \\"B,\\" controlled an intelligence network in European Russia. Additional intelligence was obtained from Russian defectors and prisoners of war who crossed the Polish lines in their thousands, especially after the 1920 Battle of Warsaw. 1921‚Äì1939 After the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and the Treaty of Riga, Polish Intelligence had to restructure to cope with new challenges. Though Poland had won most of her border conflicts (most notably the war with Russia and the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918‚Äì19 against Germany), her international situation was unenviable. By mid-1921, Section II had been restructured into three main departments, each overseeing a number of offices: * Organization Department: :# Organization; :# Training; :# Personnel; :# Finances; :# Polish ciphers and codes, communication, and foreign press. * Information Department: :# East; :# West; :# North; :# South; :# Statistics office; :# Nationalities and minorities; * Intelligence Department: :# Intelligence technology; :# Central agents' bureau; :# Counterintelligence; :# Foreign cryptography (Biuro Szyfr√≥w); :# Radio intelligence and wire-tapping. Until the late 1930s the Soviet Union was seen as the most likely aggressor and Poland's main adversary. Section II developed an extensive network of agents within Poland's eastern neighbor and other adjoining countries. In the early 1920s Polish intelligence began developing a network for \\"offensive intelligence.\\" The Eastern Office (Referat \\"Wsch√≥d\\") had several dozen bureaus, mostly attached to Polish consulates in Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, Kharkov and Tbilisi. Short-range reconnaissance was carried out by the Border Defense Corps, created in 1924. On a number of occasions, soldiers crossed the border disguised as smugglers, partisans or bandits. They gathered information on the disposition of Soviet troops and the morale of the Soviet populace. At the same time, Soviet forces carried out analogous missions on Polish soil. The situation finally stabilized in 1925; however, such missions continued to occur occasionally. Polish Intelligence produced fairly accurate pictures of the capabilities of Poland's main potential adversaries‚ÄîGermany and the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, this information was of little avail when war came in September 1939. Good intelligence could not offset the overwhelming superiority of the German and Soviet armed forces. The conquest of Poland took four weeks‚Äîtoo short a time for intelligence services to make a significant contribution. With Poland conquered, her intelligence services had to evacuate their headquarters to allied French and British territories. 1939‚Äì1945 Until 1939 Polish intelligence services did not, as a rule, collaborate with the intelligence services of other countries with exception of Imperial Japan. A partial exception was also France, Poland's closest ally; even then cooperation was lukewarm, with neither side sharing their most precious secrets. An important exception was the long-term collaboration between France's Gustave Bertrand and Poland's Cipher Bureau, headed by Gwido Langer. The situation only began to change in 1939, when war appeared certain and Britain and France entered into a formal military alliance with Poland. The most important result of the subsequent information-sharing was the disclosure to France and Britain of Polish techniques and equipment for breaking German Enigma machine ciphers. The initial break into the Enigma ciphers had been made in late 1932 by mathematician Marian Rejewski, working for the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau. His work was facilitated, perhaps decisively, by intelligence provided by Bertrand. With the help of fellow mathematicians Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki, Rejewski developed techniques to decrypt German Enigma-enciphered messages on a regular and timely basis. Six-and-a- half years after the initial Polish decryption of Enigma ciphers, French and British intelligence representatives were briefed on Polish achievements at a trilateral conference held at Cipher Bureau facilities in the Kabaty Woods, just south of Warsaw, on July 26, 1939, barely five weeks before the outbreak of World War II. This formed the basis for early Enigma decryption by the British at Bletchley Park, northwest of London. Without the head start provided by Poland, British reading of Enigma encryptions might have been delayed several years, if it would have gotten off the ground at all. Key Polish Cipher Bureau personnel escaped from Poland on September 17, 1939, on the Soviet Union's entry into eastern Poland, and eventually reached France. There, at \\"PC Bruno\\" outside Paris, they resumed cracking Enigma ciphers through the \\"Phony War\\" (October 1939 ‚Äì May 1940). Following the fall of northern France to the Germans, the Polish-French-Spanish cryptological organization, sponsored by French Major Gustave Bertrand, continued its work at \\"Cadix\\" in the Vichy \\"Free Zone\\" until it was occupied by German forces in November 1942. After the 1939 invasion of Poland, practically all of the General Staff's Section II (Intelligence) command apparatus managed to escape to Romania and soon reached France and Britain. Reactivating agent networks throughout Europe, they immediately began cooperating with French and British intelligence agencies. After the subsequent fall of France, most of Section II ended up in Britain. At that time Britain was in a difficult situation, badly in need of intelligence from occupied Europe after rapid German advances had disrupted its networks and put German forces into areas where Britain had few agents. Following the personal intervention of Churchill and Sikorski in September 1940, cooperation between British and Polish intelligence organizations entered a new phase. The Poles placed their Section II at the disposal of the British, but as a quid pro quo requested and obtained (at that time without any reservations) the right to use, without British oversight, their own ciphers which they had developed in France. The Poles were the only Allied country that was given this unique status, though as the war progressed it was challenged by some agencies of the British government. Due to support from members of the British Special Operations Executive, the Poles kept their ciphers to the end of hostilities.Michael Alfred Peszke, The Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II, p. 50. In the first half of 1941 Polish agents in France supplied Britain with intelligence on U-boat movements from French Atlantic ports. The Polish network in France grew to 1,500 members and, before and during Operation Overlord, supplied vital information about the German military in France. Agents working in Poland in the spring of 1941 supplied extensive intelligence about German preparations to invade the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa). Agency Africa was set up in July 1941 in Algiers by Mieczyslaw Zygfryd Slowikowski, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki; using the codename \\"Rygor\\" (Polish for \\"Rigor\\"). Their information was used by the Americans and British to plan the amphibious Operation Torch landings in North Africa in November 1942, the first large-scale Allied landings of the war. Polish spies also documented German atrocities being perpetrated at Auschwitz (Witold Pilecki's report) and elsewhere in Poland against Jewish and non-Jewish populations. Polish intelligence gave the British crucial information on Germany's secret-weapons projects, including the V-1 and V-2 rockets, enabling Britain to set back these German programs by bombing the main development facility at Peenem√ºnde in 1943. Poland's networks supplied the western Allies with intelligence on nearly all aspects of the German war effort. Of 45,770 reports received by British intelligence during the war, nearly half (22,047) came from Polish agents. On March 15, 1946, Section II was officially disbanded, and its archives were taken over by Britain. At Section II's dissolution, it had 170 officers and 3,500 agents, excluding headquarters staff. Very likely at least some of the Polish agents continued working directly for Britain during the Cold War. The Polish intelligence contribution to Britain's war effort was kept secret due to Cold War exigencies. In later years, as official British histories were released, the Polish intelligence role barely rated a mention. Only when British wartime decryption of Enigma ciphers was made public in the 1970s, did a Polish contribution begin to become known; even then, however, the early versions published in Britain (and some versions even to the end of the 20th century) claimed that Polish intelligence had only been able to steal a German Enigma machine. The truth, which had previously been disclosed in Bertrand's book and would later be detailed in papers by Marian Rejewski (who had survived the war and lived to 1980), made slow headway against British and American obfuscations, mendacities and fabrications.Christopher Kasparek has argued that the western Allies did themselves a disservice in first keeping secret for three decades the major contribution that reading of German ciphers made to Allied victory, and then claiming for themselves all the glory of the Enigma-breaking achievement; for this has led a couple of subsequent generations of western politicians and military officers to, in the words of F.W. Winterbotham, \\"be fooled by the spate of televisions films and propagands which has made [World War II] seem like some great triumphant epic,\\" and thus underestimate the hazards of later conflicts. (Kasparek's observation in Koaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 33.) The Polish Enigma-breaking effort had been much more sophisticated than those English-language accounts made out, and had in fact relied largely on mathematical analysis. Historians' efforts to gain access to documentation of other Polish intelligence operations met with British stonewalling and with claims that the pertinent Polish archives had been destroyed by the British. Polish intelligence supplied valuable intelligence to the Allies; 48% of all reports received by the British secret services from continental Europe in between 1939 and 1945 came from Polish sources. The total number of those reports is estimated about bout 80,000, and 85% of them were deemed high or better quality. Despite Poland becoming occupied, the Polish intelligence network not only survived but grew rapidly, and near the end of the war had over 1,600 registered agents. Western Allies had limited intelligence assets in Central and Eastern Europe, and extensive Polish intelligence network in place proved to be a major asset, even described as \\"the only allied intelligence assets on the Continent\\" following the French capitulation. According to , for the Western Allies, the intelligence provided by the Home Army was considered to be the best source of information on the Eastern Front. 1945‚Äì1989 =Civilian branches= On occupying Poland and installing a puppet government, the Soviet Union created new Polish intelligence and internal-security agencies. The Soviet special services had begun training Polish officers as early as 1943. That year, some 120 Poles had begun training at an NKVD school in Kuybyshev (now Samara). At the same time, in NKVD-NKGB schools all over the USSR, hundreds of Germans, Romanians, Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians had also undergone the same training in order to prepare them for work in future special services in their respective countries. In July 1944 in Moscow the temporary Polish puppet government was established by the name of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego), or PKWN. The PKWN was organized as thirteen departments (resorty). One of them was the Department of Public Security (Resort Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Publicznego), or RBP, headed by long- time Polish communist Stanis≈Çaw Radkiewicz. The largest and the most important department in the RBP, Department 1, was responsible for counter-espionage and headed by Roman Romkowski. By September 1945 Department 1 had become so large that three additional departments were created, as well as two separate sections. By the close of 1944, the Department of Public Security totaled 3000 employees. On December 31, 1944, the PKWN was joined by several members of the Polish government in exile, among them Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk. It was then transformed into the Provisional Government of Republic of Poland (RzƒÖd Tymczasowy Republiki Polskiej, or RTRP), and the departments were renamed as ministries. The Ministry of Public Security was responsible for both intelligence and counter-espionage, as well as surveillance of citizens and suppression of dissent. They generally did not employ former officers of the \\"Dwojka\\" or follow the traditions of pre-war Polish intelligence services. Personnel were recruited for their \\"political reliability\\". New formations were trained by Soviet NKVD experts. Additionally, and especially in the early years (1945‚Äì49), Soviet officers in Polish uniforms overlooked their operations. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953 and the later defection of Col. J√≥zef ≈öwiat≈Ço, the Ministry of Public Security was canceled and replaced by two separate administrations - the Committee for Public Security (Komitet do Spraw Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Publicznego, or Kds.BP) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ministerstwo Spraw Wewnƒôtrznych or MSW). The Kds.BP was responsible for intelligence and government protection and. From September 3, 1955 to 28 November 1956, the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (G≈Ç√≥wny ZarzƒÖd Informacji Wojska Polskiego), which was responsible for the military police and counter-espionage agency, was also controlled by the Kds.BP. The MSW was responsible for the supervision of local governments, Militsiya, correctional facilities, fire rescue and the border and internal guards. The next big changes came in 1956. The Committee for Public Security was canceled and the Ministry of Internal Affairs took over their responsibilities. The MSW assumed control of the political police, under the S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa. From 1956 to the fall of communism in Poland the MSW was one of the biggest and strongest administrations. During this period its responsibilities included intelligence, counter-espionage, anti-state activity (SB), government protection, confidential communications, supervision of the local governments, militsiya, correctional facilities, and fire rescue. The Ministry of Internal Affairs was divided into departments. The most important of these were the first second and third departments. The first dealt with foreign operations and intelligence gathering, the second with spy activities both by Poland and other countries and the third was responsible for anti-state activities and the protection of the country's secrets. With the exception of its own departments and sections, the MSW also had control over the Militsiya (Komenda G≈Ç√≥wna Milicji Obywatelskiej or KG/MO), fire rescue (Komenda G≈Ç√≥wna Stra≈ºy Po≈ºarnych or KG/SP), territorial anti-aircraft defense, (Komenda G≈Ç√≥wna Terenowej Obrony Przeciwlotniczej KG/TOP), management of geodesy and cartography, (G≈Ç√≥wny ZarzƒÖd Geodezji i Kartografii) and health services (Centralny ZarzƒÖd S≈Çu≈ºby Zdrowia). Ministry of Internal Affairs also had control over the command of the Internal Security Corp. (Dow√≥dztwo Korpusu Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Wewnƒôtrznego or KBW), command of the Border Guard (Dow√≥dztwo Wojsk Ochrony Pogranicza or KOP), and management of Information of Internal Troops (ZarzƒÖd Informacji Wojsk Wewnetrznych). Through the 1980s the MSW had 24,390 staff in Security Services, 62,276 in the Citizen's Militsiya, 12,566 in Motorized Reserves of the Citizens Militia (Zmotoryzowane Odwody Milicji Obywatelskiej, or ZOMO), 20,673 in Administratively-Economic Units (Jednostki administracyjno-gospodarcze) and 4,594 in ministry schools, not including students. = Military branches = The first military special services in Poland after World War II were created in 1943 as part of the Polish military in the USSR. First organ that dealt with military counterespionage was called Directorate of Information by the commander-in-chief of the Polish Army (ZarzƒÖd Informacji Naczelnego Dow√≥dcy Wojska Polskiego, or ZI NDWP). On November 30, 1944, the commander-in-chief of the Polish Army, general Micha≈Ç Rola-≈ªymierski, transformed the ZI NDWP into the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (G≈Ç√≥wny ZarzƒÖd Informacji Wojska Polskiego, or GZI WP) in his 95th order. From 30 November 1950, the GZI WP became the Main Directorate of Information of the Ministry of Defense (G≈Ç√≥wny ZarzƒÖd Informacji Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, or GZI MON). In September 1955 GZI MON became part of the Committee for Public Security (Komitet do spraw Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Publicznego), which was the successor of Ministerstwo Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Publicznego, more commonly known as the UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa or UB, and the name was changed to the Main Directorate of Information of the Committee for Public Security, or GZI KdsBP. In November 1956 the GZI Kds.BP separated from the Committee for Public Security, and returned to its previous role, becoming again the Main Directorate of Information of the Ministry of Defense. After the reform instituted by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka in 1956, and the role the GZI played in repressions and executions, the Main Directorate of Information of Ministry of Defense was canceled in 1957 and replaced by the Military Internal Service (Wojskowa S≈Çu≈ºba Wewnƒôtrzna, or WSW). The WSW continuously operated as the main military police and counterespionage service until the fall of communism in Poland. The first Polish Military Intelligence after World War II was the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army (Oddzia≈Ç II Sztabu Generalnego Ludowego Wojska Polskiego, or Odzia≈Ç II Szt Gen LWP) and bore the same name as its precursor from before the war. Odzia≈Ç II Szt Gen WP was established on July 18, 1945, but its origins can be traced to May 1943, when the first reconnaissance company was created in Polish Army units in the USSR. Between July 1947 and June 5, 1950, the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army operated within the structure of the Ministry of Public Security together with the civilian intelligence branch as Department VII. On June 5, 1950, it returned to the Ministry of Defense. The first head of Odzia≈Ç II Szt Gen WP was Colonel Gieorgij Domeradzki. In November 1945 this position was occupied by General Wac≈Çaw Komar, and between October 1950 and March 1951 by soviet officer Konstantin Kahnikov. The last commander of the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army was Igor Suchacki. On November 15, 1951, Polish Defence Minister Konstantin Rokossovsky (in his 88th order) transformed the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army to Second Directorate of General Staff of the Polish Army (ZarzƒÖd II Sztabu Generalnego Wojska Polskiego). Internal organization was transformed from sections to directorates and intelligence work among the United States, Great Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria was expanded to countries such as Norway, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey and Israel. In 1990 the Second Directorate of General Staff of the Polish Army was join with the Military Internal Service (Wojskowa S≈Çu≈ºba Wewnƒôtrzna, or WSW), in order to have intelligence and counter-intelligence working under one structure as the Second Directorate for Intelligence and Counter-intelligence (ZarzƒÖd II Wywiadu i Kontrwywiadu). In 1991 the Second Directorate for Intelligence and Counter-intelligence was transformed into Military Information Services (Wojskowe S≈Çu≈ºby Informacyjne, or WSI), and continues to function under this name. 1989‚Äìpresent After the changes of 1989 the S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa was disbanded by the first free government under the prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki. A new agency, called the State Protection Office (UrzƒÖd Ochrony Pa≈Ñstwa, or UOP) was formed and staffed mainly by the former SB officers who successfully passed a verification procedure. Its mission was primarily general espionage and intelligence gathering as well as counter-espionage and fighting against high ranked organized crime. It was commanded by a career intelligence officer but was directly supervised by a civilian government official, Coordinator for the Special Services. Most of the time the agency evaded public attention, although it was dragged into political fighting over appointments of its chiefs, lustration and some perceived failures with organized crime cases. In 2002 the new, post-communist left-wing government reorganized the special services by dividing them into two agencies; the Internal Security Agency (Agencja Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Wewnƒôtrznego) and Intelligence Agency (Agencja Wywiadu). The move was widely perceived as a way of cleansing the higher ranks of the officers appointed by previous right-wing governments. The military intelligence continued to function under a slightly altered name (Wojskowe S≈Çu≈ºby Informacyjne- Military Information Services) and without much organizational change; at least none that was visible to the general public. The new Polish conservative government declared dissolution of the WSI and creating new services in October 2005, since the agency skipped serious external reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989. Throughout the transformation the WSI were allegedly involved in dubious operations, arms sales to UN-sanctioned states and corruption scandals. In 2006 the WSI was split into S≈Çu≈ºba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego and S≈Çu≈ºba Wywiadu Wojskowego. = Notable operations = * Operation Simoom, 1990  Notable personnel  * Feliks Ankerstein * Edmund Charaszkiewicz. * Roman Czerniawski * J√≥zef Englicht * Jan Kowalewski. * Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki * Kazimierz Leski * Jan Le≈õniak. * Stefan Mayer. * Wiktor Micha≈Çowski. * Tadeusz Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski * Tadeusz Puszczy≈Ñski * Tadeusz Schaetzel * Zbigniew SiemiƒÖtkowski * Mieczys≈Çaw Zygfryd S≈Çowikowski. * Halina Szyma≈Ñska See also * Biuro Szyfr√≥w (Polish General Staff Cipher Bureau) * History of the Polish Army. * Stare Kiejkuty, home of military unit 2669; allegedly involved in the CIA's network of extraordinary renditions. * List of Poles in intelligence * List of intelligence agencies of Poland Notes References * Michael Alfred Peszke, The Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II, foreword by Piotr S.

The population of the civil parish was 1,990 at the 2011 Census. Cheveley falls within the local government district of East Cambridgeshire. Geographically, Cheveley stands on the third highest point in Cambridgeshire at above sea level. The attractive hamlet of Cheveley Park is a mile from Cheveley. It is the home of Cheveley Park Stud. Land use in Cheveley The trees of the Duke of Rutland's old park, no longer a ducal domain, spread over into the roadway and gardens of this village near the Suffolk border. A linear village, Cheveley's non-residential land use consists almost entirely of paddock land used by studs, the most notable being the Cheveley Park Stud, after which the Cheveley Park Stakes are named. War memorial By the road outside the church, in memory of the men who did not come back, stands a soldier with bowed head in a niche below a cross. The Jacobean Rectory has great (possibly 18th-century) iron gates, said to have come from the Alington family's seat at Horseheath. Church Cheveley church The fine aisleless church, in the shape of a cross, has a 600-year-old tower beginning square and ending with eight sides, a turret rising from the ground, with a winding stairway to the belfry and a summit once used for beacon fires. The fine arches with clustered pillars on which the tower rests are the glory of the church indoors, recalling the days when there were four guilds here, each guild keeping a light burning on these piers. Three of the four brackets for the lights are still here, one carved with a face and one a grotesque little fellow with his legs doubled behind him. The church belongs to England's three great building centuries, and still has the oak screen set in its chancel arch 600 years ago. The choir-stalls are 'modern' with fine carvings of dogs, fishes, birds, bats, dragons, and a wolf. There are two Jacobean chairs, and a richly inlaid one of cypress wood, the seat opening to form a chest; it is thought to be the throne of a Venetian Doge of the 14th century. A little glass in a transept window is older still. The painted font is 19th-century, most unusual in its blaze of colour, a new dress in mediaeval style. Under an arch on the chancel wall is one of the Folkes family, in a red cloak, reading a book. He died in 1642. There is a memorial to James Hand, who was Rector for 49 years until 1830. There are some pictures and a description of the church at the Cambridgeshire Churches website.The church's page at the Cambridgeshire Churches website Education Children initially attend the primary school in the village, with many then going on to the nearby secondary school Bottisham Village College. In the 1920s, one of the pupils at Cheveley Church of England Primary School was Bill Tutte, who later became a noted 20th century mathematician, especially remembered for his brilliant code-breaking activities at Bletchley Park during World War II. Amenities Presently, Cheveley has many local amenities. The recreation ground provides an off-road field, where cricket, football and mere dog walking take place. The Red Lion public house is situated to the south of the village. The local village store, Cheveley Post Office is situated opposite the Red Lion pub. The Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village.

It existed until 1584. It is now a swamp known as the Drowned Land of Saeftinghe (Verdronken land van Saeftinghe) and an official nature reserve area. The land is a crosspoint where the river Scheldt meets the salty waters of the North Sea in the estuary Western Scheldt. It is a treacherous place where the tides easily consume large stretches of land in a matter of seconds and must not be explored without an experienced guide. History Saeftinghe was drained in the 13th century under the management of the abbey of Ter Doest. Willem van Saeftinghe was one of the best known occupants of the abbey and gave his name to the stretch of land claimed from the sea. Up to 1570, the land was very fertile polder. Agriculture, peat burning and trade turned Saeftinghe into one of the most prosperous places in the region. There were several additional settlements nearby: Namen, Sint-Laureins, Stampaert, Weele (Sint-Marie), Sint- Laureijns and Casuwele. The settlements - mostly small villages with just a few houses and huts - are today buried beneath several layers of clay and sand due to several floods over the years. Large bricks were found at several places in land. Those bricks were probably remainders of the abbey used by the villagers to build their houses when the abbey was destroyed due to several floods. Today some of those bricks can be seen in the nearby Visitors Center. Most of the land around the town was lost in the All Saint's flood of 1570 (the Allerheiligenvloed). Four years later the drowned land reached into what is now Belgium. Only Saeftinghe and some surrounding land managed to remain dry. In 1584, during the Eighty Years' War, Dutch soldiers found themselves forced to destroy the last intact dike and Saeftinghe sunk into the waters of the Scheldt. Attempts to reclaim the area were made throughout history; the most serious project taking place in 1907, but even then only the was conquered from the sea. Nowadays a hamlet is located within the reclaimed portions of land, called . Saaftinge itself has never been retrieved. In 1970, all of the area was incorporated into the municipality of Hulst, when Graauw en Langendam and Clinge ceased to exist. Within the historical municipal limits, Saaftinge today has a population of 55. The flag consists of a blue lion rampant on a white field. The lion originates from the personal shield of Willem van Saeftinghe.A.M. Schouten, \\"Historische Gemeenten van Nederland en hun Vlaggen\\", 2012. The legend A legend of Saeftinghe attributes the All Saint's flood to capturing a mermaid and not setting her free. This caused the region to be cursed by the merman, and led to the flood that destroyed the towns of Sint-Laureins, Namen and Casuwele, killing all inhabitants. The legend holds that a tower bell calls for help from the sunken town. Another Saeftinghe legend holds the believe that visitors of the area and inhabitants of the nearby village of Emmadorp sometimes see 'ghosts' in the fog. According to the legend the ghosts are the spirits of the inhabitants of the three towns killed in the flood. Visitor centre A visitor centre opened in Emmadorp in 1997, from where excursions to the nature reserve depart. From 1997 to 2007, an average of around 12,000 visitors per year went on excursions.

Early life He was born 10 March 1549 in Montilla, the third child of Mateo S√°nchez Solano and Ana Jim√©nez. He was educated by the Jesuits, but felt drawn to the poverty and penitential life of the Franciscan friars. At the age of twenty, he joined the Order of Friars Minor at Montilla,Donovan, Stephen. \\"St. Francis Solanus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 09 September 2018 entering the novitiate at St. Lawrence Friary, which was located in a place of great natural beauty. The community there belonged to the Reformed observance within the Order, following a very strict routine of prayer, silence and fasting. Francis followed this regimen rigorously, always going barefoot, abstaining from meat, and wearing a hairshirt throughout that entire year. As a result, however, his health was permanently affected, leaving him sick and fatigued. Solano was solemnly professed in 1569.Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúFrancis Solano‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 5 May 2013 He was then sent to the friary of Our Lady of Loreto in Seville for his seminary studies. There he learned not only philosophy and theology but developed his musical talents. He was ordained in 1576, a ceremony his mother was unable to attend due to her poor health. He was then named Master of Ceremonies for the community. Still a lover of simplicity, Francis made a small cell for himself by the chapel of the friary, made of clay and reeds. After completing his final theological studies, Solano was assigned as an itinerant preacher to the surrounding villages of the region. He was eventually given a license as a confessor. During this period, he requested that he might be allowed to go to North Africa, with the hope of achieving martyrdom for preaching the Catholic faith. He was denied this request. At that point, Solano shifted his vision to the American missions. After the death of his father, Solano returned to his hometown of Montilla to care for his mother. During that time, he gained the reputation of a wonderworker, as a number of people were cured of their afflictions through his intercession. In 1583, A pestilence having broken out at Granada, he tended the sick and dying. New World Spanish King Philip II requested the Franciscans to send missionaries to preach the Gospel in the Americas. In 1589 Solanus sailed from Spain to the New World, and having landed at Panama, crossed the isthmus and embarked on a vessel that was to convey him to Peru. During the journey, a storm at sea crashed his ship against the rocks not far from Peru. The crew and the passengers abandoned the ship, but Francis stayed with the slaves that were on board. After three days, they were rescued. For twenty years Solano worked at evangelizing the vast regions of Tucuman (present day northwestern Argentina) and Paraguay. He had a skill for languages and succeeded at learning many of the regions' native tongues in a fairly short period. It is claimed he could also address tribes of different tongues in one language yet be understood by them all. Being a musician as well, Solano also played the violin frequently for the natives. He is often depicted playing this instrument. After that came Solano's appointment as guardian of the Franciscan friary in Lima, Peru. Further, he filled the same office for the friaries of his Order in Tucuman and Paraguay. Murillo Around 1601 he was called to Lima, Peru, where he tried to recall the Spanish colonists to their baptismal integrity.\\"St. Francis Solano\\", Saint of the Day, Franciscan Media It is said that Solanus predicted the devastating 1619 earthquake of Trujillo, Peru. He died at Lima. Veneration Solanus was beatified by Pope Clement X in 1675, and canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. His feast is kept throughout the Franciscan Order on 24 July (except currently the United States, where it is celebrated on 14 July). Francis Solanus is the patron saint of Montilla. The Parish Church of San Francisco Solano is built on the site of the former house where he was born. He is also patron of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru. Legacy Mission San Francisco Solano, the northernmost mission along California's El Camino Real, was named in 1823 for Francisco Solano. In Humahuaca, every day at precisely 12 noon, on the city hall belltower, heavy copper doors slowly open and a life-sized animated wooden, dramatic-looking statue of San Francisco Solano appears for about two minutes and gives his benediction to the silent crowd amassed on the village plaza.

He is best known for his radio programs that feature new wave and popular music from the 1980s. He was a disk jockey at KROQ in Los Angeles from 1982 to 2000 and has been a host for SiriusXM's 1st Wave classic alternative station since 2005. Biography Richard Thomas Sheppard attended Oxford University, graduating in 1974, and worked as a club DJ known as \\"The Young Dick Sheppard\\" in the United Kingdom and Europe. He moved to the United States in 1976 where he continued his work as a club DJ, and served as a party DJ for celebrities in Los Angeles. He began his radio career in 1980, initially working for stations in Bakersfield, San Luis Obispo and Long Beach before joining KROQ-FM in 1982. He took a new name from the 1982 science fiction film, Blade Runner. Within a few months of working in Los Angeles, Blade had become the #1 Arbitron-rated radio personality on the West Coast, and in 1982, he began to host a daily television program on KCAL-TV called MV3, which later became Video One. In 1984, he created, produced and hosted VideoBeat for KTLA. The weekly series ran for two years. Between 1991 and 2003, Blade hosted several music-related television programs, including America's Top 10, which he took over from Casey Kasem, and audio music programs for in-flight entertainment produced by Sony Transcom.

He was the brother of Max Adler. Life and career A close friend of Arnold Schoenberg from their schooldays, Adler taught him the rudiments of music, gave him his first grounding in philosophy, and played chamber music with him. Though self-taught, Adler for many years led a string quartet whose regular cellist was another composer-friend, Franz Schmidt. Adler also played in Schoenberg's Society for Private Musical Performances, lectured on music and philosophy, as well as giving musical and spiritual advice to, and casting horoscopes for, many of Vienna's leading creative artists. In 1935 the violinist Louis Krasner consulted Adler (as well as Carl Flesch) about the solo part of Alban Berg's Violin Concerto, which Krasner had commissioned but could not, at that time, play. Around this time, Adler was also the teacher of the young Hans Keller, later a musician, writer and Schoenberg-expert resident in the UK. After the Anschluss, Schoenberg tried to arrange for Adler to come to California, but he escaped instead to the United Kingdom, spending the 1940s in the Lake District and his last years in London. Adler and Schoenberg resumed their friendship by letter in the late 1940s; some of the correspondence is published. Adler's principal books were Critique of Pure Music (1918, still unpublished), and The Testament of Astrology (published in 3 volumes 1935‚Äì37, many subsequent editions). The Testament of Astrology was translated into English by his devoted pupil Zdenka Orenstein and edited by Amy Shapiro. A biography, by Amy Shapiro, includes letters, stories and memoirs gathered across twenty years of discovery, of people who recounted the vital role that Dr. Oskar Adler played in Vienna's pre-Nazi cultural life before 1938 and while in exile.

The Khmer Rouge's takeover of Phnom Penh was rapidly followed by a series of drastic revolutionary de-industrialization policies which resulted in a death toll which vastly exceeded the death toll which resulted from the French Reign of Terror.

Most commonly known as Angus Allan and sometimes credited as Angus P. Allan, he was responsible for original comic strip adaptations of numerous popular TV series. Allan's output was prolific, and virtually all the Look-In comic strips were his creations. Some of his comic works included The Six Million Dollar Man, Logan's Run and Charlie's Angels. Allan collaborated with many well-known British comic strip artists, including Jim Baikie and Arthur Ranson.

Founded in 1926 by Ulrich Maisch as Maisch & Co, the company originally manufactured 98 and 123 cc Ilo two-stroke engines. After World War II, they began producing their own unit construction two-stroke engines, selling complete motorcycles. Maico () made a brief foray into the automobile business with their own line of microcars in the late 1950s. Maico have also made go kart engines.Title: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, Editor: Erwin Tragatsch, Publisher: New Burlington Books, Copyright: 1979 Quarto Publishing, Edition: 1988 Revised, Page 198, The road motorcycles were named after winds... \\"Blizzard\\", \\"Typhoon\\" etc., but the company was better known for its purpose-built motocross and enduro machines, and for its 'Maicoletta' motor scooters, all of which sold in higher numbers than the road motorcycles. Maico racing motorcycles 1974 Maico 400 GP Maico motocross (MC) and enduro (GS) racing models proved very successful in both European and American competition throughout the 1970s. While lacking the financial capital and big money race- team backing like that of the Japanese factories of Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, and Kawasaki, Maico riders such as Adolf Weil, √Öke Jonsson and Willy Bauer proved to be serious challenges to the Japanese factories and produced numerous top- three finishes in the Motocross World Championships. The firm also experienced some success in Grand Prix road racing competitions with rider B√∂rje Jansson winning three 125cc Grand Prix races between 1972 and 1973. American publication Motocross Action called the 1981 Maico Mega 2 - 490cc the greatest open-class motocross bike of all time. 1979 Maico 250 Magnum One of the largest contributions to the world of motocross suspension technology came in the 1974 season when the Wheelsmith Motorcycles team in the US and the Gunther Schier teams in Europe forward-mounted the rear shocks on the Maico factory- backed motorcycles, immediately increasing the travel and ability to best the competition. This initiated a frantic effort on the part of factory teams and privateers alike; chopping up their frames in a desperate attempt to remain competitive. Maicowerk AG filed for bankruptcy in 1983, but continued to produce small numbers of motocross and enduro models (re-badged as M-Stars in the United States due to legal issues) through 1986. Subsequent manufacturers have purchased the brand name and applied it to their own limited production motorcycles. Modern open-class dirt-bikes are still being produced under the Maico brandnameMaico UK Home.

Many riders restore vintage Maicos for display or to take back to the track. The new Maico launched in 2013, a 685 cross model with 82 horsepower (60 kW), is one of the most powerful motocross bikes on the market. Maicoletta Maicoletta scooter Maicoletta Dash The Maicoletta motor scooter of the 1950s was one of the largest motor scooters produced by any manufacturer until the modern era. The engine was a single cylinder 247cc piston-port two-stroke (an export version featuring a 277cc engine was also produced for use with a sidecar), with four foot- operated gears, enclosed chain drive, centrifugal fan cooling and electric start. This was fitted to a tubular frame built on motorcycle principles with long travel telescopic forks and 14-inch wheels. The Maicoletta had a top speed of greater than 70 mph, comparable with most 250cc motorcycles of the time. In the 1950s most scooters such as Vespa, Lambretta, were 125cc to 200cc with 8-10 inch wheels and a top speed of 55 to 60 mph, so the expensive but fast and comfortable Maicoletta developed a following amongst scooter club enthusiasts. By modern standards the brakes (drum front and rear) leave something to be desired, but compared to those of other scooters from the period, the brakes are not inferior. Pendulum starter An unusual Bosch six-volt \\"pendulum\\" electric starter system was fitted, which was quite advanced for the 1950s, and about which there are a number of common misconceptions. When activated, instead of rotating the crankshaft the starter used the generator coils on the shaft to rock it back and forth under the control of cams on the crankshaft. These cams closed contacts in the generator to trigger a reversing switch in the \\"control box\\" that changed the crankshaft direction at the end of each swing. This gives the impression of the crankshaft continually bouncing back and forwards against compression, when operated. A separate set of ignition points fired the spark plug in the forward direction only, and when this fires the mixture in the cylinder the engine starts to rotate normally, the starter was released and the normal ignition system took over. The advantage of this system is that the starter does not have to force the crankshaft to turn over against compression, so less power is required from the six volt system. Its disadvantage is the unusual number of contacts, which can be difficult to adjust. The reversing switch contacts tend to wear out with extended use and can be very difficult to get repaired, hence the scooter's reputation for requiring roll starts later in life. Maico Mobil Maicomobil The Maico Mobil, said to resemble a \\"two-wheeled car\\", was a highly enclosed two-wheel motorcycle which sold only in small numbers. It was designed to provide motorcycle handling combined with scooter convenience, a large trunk, and weather protection. It was nicknamed the \\"dustbin\\".

The series is unrelated to the earlier Bad City Blue featuring Button Men in 2000 AD #468-479. Premise Harry Exton, an ex-soldier, is a \\"Button Man\\", a hired killer pitted against others in an underground sport. Each works for a mysterious \\"Voice\\", a rich man of unknown identity. The object of the game is to defeat one's opponents, and take their marker - the first two joints of a finger. Button Men who lose three fingers are executed. While killing an opponent is generally acceptable, it is not always the preferred outcome of a match - on one occasion Exton's Voice loses a wager when Exton kills his opponent rather than taking his marker, thus beginning the souring of the relationship between Exton and his Voice. The Voices profit from the game by gambling on the outcome, and a ruthless killer such as Harry Exton can make a modestly wealthy man extremely rich. The Button Men themselves are paid well for their tasks. Despite being exceptionally good at the sport and not losing any markers during his involvement, Exton decides to quit, and tracks down his Voice killing him, thinking that will remove him from the sport. This grants him temporary freedom and he settles down anonymously in a small town, even starting an affair with a local waitress. He is himself tracked down by other Button Men (and a Button Woman) whose Voices view Exton as the ultimate sport due to his previous unparalleled success. Exton has advance warning of their presence when he spots them disguised as tourists in the Diner his girlfriend works at, and notices that one is missing two markers. Exton kills all the other operatives apart from one with whom he makes a deal - he cuts off his own finger and gives it to the surviving Button Man before dropping a tracking device (inserted into a filling by the jealous husband) into a lake. This convinces the Voices that Exton is dead, and the hunt is called off. Later Exton reneges on his deal and kills the final Button Man to ensure that there are no loose ends. Publication Button Man ran for four series.

It is the last chapter in his Eugene trilogy, following Brighton Beach Memoirs and Biloxi Blues. Plot overview The play is about Eugene and his older brother, Stanley, dealing with their parents' relationship falling apart as the brothers work together toward being comedy writers for the radio, and, eventually, television. They discover that their father, Jack, has been cheating on their mother, Kate. It is obvious to the family before Jack even admits it, and they try to find ways for Kate to cope with the loss when Jack may eventually leave. Jack reveals that the woman he has been seeing is dying. When Eugene and Stanley find a job where they can write short comedic skits for the radio, they obscurely make fun of their own family. Jack can hear the similarities between the fictional family in the broadcast and their own family, and becomes outraged. He gets into a major argument with Stanley, which turns into an argument about Jack's affair. Later, Kate holds a nostalgic conversation with Eugene, revealing how she had tried to win his father's heart when she was younger. Eventually, Jack leaves. Stanley and Eugene move out when they get the great offers for which they'd hoped. Kate remains in the house with her father, Ben (an elderly Jewish man with socialist leanings who provides the play with most of its warmth and humor), until Ben goes to follow his wife to Miami. Characters Eugene Morris Jerome - The play's narrator and the focal character of the Eugene trilogy. Carefree, witty to a fault, and quick to joke, he is 23 years old and working in the stock room of a music company before his brother and writing partner, Stanley, helps them both to break into the world of showbiz. While he maintains his affable and seemingly care-free nature, Eugene cares deeply about everyone in his family, especially for his parents - whom he bases the ridiculous characters of his first big comedy sketch on. Neil Simon wrote Eugene as his own self, the playwright's semi-autobiographical analogue in the work. Stanley Jerome - Eugene's older brother. At 28 years old, he is neurotic, high-strung, and constantly obsessing and worrying over the details. He brokers the first opportunity for he and his brother to show their material to NBC Studios and co-writes the sketch with his brother; the two constantly bicker and play as they attempt to write their first big comedy sketch. Later, it is Stanley who stands up to Jack in their iconic argument in Act II. Ben Epstein - Father of Kate, grandfather to Stanley and Eugene. A born socialist and ardent follower of Trotsky, he lives with his daughter and her family in Brighton Beach. Stan and Eugene find Grandpa, in his age, to be one of their greatest goldmines for accidental comedy, with Eugene going so far as to say to the audience that \\"he was the greatest teacher of comedy I ever had...and he didn't even know I was studying him.\\" He cares deeply for his daughters and their families, but due to his upbringing and beliefs is not an affectionate man. Kate Jerome - A strong woman through and through, Eugene and Stanley's mother has done her best to take care of her father, Ben, while raising her boys and keeping a wary eye on her husband. She values family, and familial experiences - such as the simple act of sitting down and eating together as a family. She knows her boys are grown men, but will never not see them as her babies - when Eugene becomes ill during Act II, she admonishes him as a child for not being in bed when the radio show begins, among other examples. Before the start of the play, she is already aware of her husband's indiscretions, and is the one to confront him over them - however, she stands her ground and does not falter when Jack admits his guilt. Jack Jerome - The father to Eugene and Stanley, he's a tough nut for certain. Having worked as a clothier for many years, making ladies raincoats, he's become a bit numb to the monotony of life. This in turn, before the play's start, lead him to having a brief affair, on again and off again. Like Ben, he is not an affectionate man, masked by his exhaustion and his own self-provided frustrations. He becomes outraged when the radio program his sons wrote turns out to sound eerily similar to their own family situation, and quickly admonishes them before being put back into place by Stanley for his own affairs. He leaves Kate at the end of the play. Blanche Morton - Kate's (now) well-to-do sister, who featured more heavily in 'Brighton Beach Memoirs'. She has remarried, and her second husband built himself up to afford a home on Park Avenue and the finer things in life. Ben is at odds with Blanche when she comes to visit in Act I - she wants him to move to Florida with his semi-estranged wife, who he avoids speaking with. He, on the other hand, can only focus on Blanche's giving in to capitalist society. She ultimately serves as the beginning framework, in her conversations with Ben, where we learn of the real situation between Jack and Kate.

It is also widely referred to as the Persian Festival of Autumn.Bahrami, Askar, Jashnha-ye Iranian, Tehran, 1383, p. 35. Introduction According to The Wiley- Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism (2015), it was originally a feast honoring the Zoroastrian yazata Mithra. By the 4th century BCE, it was observed as one of the name-day feasts, a form it retains in today. Still, in a predominantly Muslim Iran, it is one of the two pre-Islamic festivals that continue to be celebrated by the public at large: MehrgƒÅn, dedicated to Mithra (modern Mehr), and Tirgan, dedicated to Tishtrya (modern Tir). Name-day feasts are festivals celebrated on the day of the year when the day-name and month- name dedicated to a particular divinity intersect. The Mehr day in the Mehr month corresponded to the day farmers harvested their crops. They thus also celebrated the fact Ahura Mazda had given them food to survive the coming cold months. Irrespective of which calendar is observed, MehrgƒÅn falls on the 196th day of the calendar year. For details on how this date is calculated, see basis for the date, below. For calendars that have March 21 as Nowruz or New Year's Day (i.e. in the Fasili and Bastani variants of the Zoroastrian calendar as well as in the Iranian civil calendar), MehrgƒÅn falls on October 2. For the Shahanshahi variant of the Zoroastrian calendar, which in 2006‚Äì2007 has New Year's Day on August 20, MehrgƒÅn fell on March 3 of the following Gregorian year. For the Kadmi variant, which has New Year's Day 30 days earlier, MehrgƒÅn falls on February 1. In al-Biruni's eleventh-century Book of Instructions in the Elements of the Art of Astrology (233), the astronomer observed that \\"some people have given the preference to MihragƒÅn [over Nowruz, i.e. New Year's day/Spring Equinox] by as much as they prefer autumn to spring.\\". As Biruni also does for the other festival days he mentions, he reiterates a local anecdotal association for his description of Mehrgan (ha al-mirjan in the author's Arabic parlance) with a fragment of a tale from Iranian folklore: On this day, Fereydun vanquished the evil Zahhak and confined him to Mount Damavand. This fragment of the legend is part of a greater cycle that ties Mehrgan with Nowruz; Dahak vanquished Jamshid (who the legends have as the one establishing Nowruz or New Year's Day), and Fereydun vanquishes Dahak, so restoring the balance. The association of Mehrgan with the polarity of spring/autumn, sowing/harvest and the birth/rebirth cycle did not escape Biruni either, for as he noted, \\"they consider MihragƒÅn as a sign of resurrection and the end of the world, because at MihragƒÅn that which grows reaches perfection.\\" In ancient times Mehregan Table Persian Festival of Autumn in UCTI University of Malaysia by Persian Students, 2011. MehrgƒÅn was celebrated in an extravagant style at Persepolis. Not only was it the time for harvest, but it was also the time when the taxes were collected. Visitors from different parts of the Persian Empire brought gifts for the king all contributing to a lively festival. During pre-Islamic and early Islamic Iran, MehrgƒÅn was celebrated with the same magnificence and pageantry as Nowruz. It was customary for people to send or give their king, and each other, gifts. Rich people usually gave gold and silver coins, heroes and warriors gave horses while others gave gifts according to their financial power and ability, even as simple as an apple. Those fortunate enough would help the poor with gifts. Gifts to the royal court of over ten thousand gold coins were registered. If the gift-giver needed money at a later time, the court would then return twice the gift amount. Kings gave two audiences a year: one audience at Nowruz and other at MehregƒÅn. During the MehregƒÅn celebrations, the king wore a fur robe and gave away all his summer clothes. After the Mongol invasion of Iran, the feast celebration of MehrgƒÅn lost its popularity. Zoroastrians of Yazd and KermƒÅn continued to celebrate MehrgƒÅn in an extravagant way. In the present-day For this celebration, the participants wear new clothes and set a decorative, colorful table. The sides of the tablecloth are decorated with dry marjoram. A copy of the Khordeh Avesta (\\"little Avesta\\"), a mirror and a sormeh-dan (a traditional eyeliner or kohl) are placed on the table together with rosewater, sweets, flowers, vegetables and fruits, especially pomegranates and apples, and nuts such as almonds or pistachios. A few silver coins and lotus seeds are placed in a dish of water scented with marjoram extract. A burner is also part of the table setting for kondor/loban (frankincense) and espand (seeds of Peganum harmala, Syrian rue) to be thrown on the flames. At lunch time when the ceremony begins, everyone in the family stands in front of the mirror to pray. Sharbat is drunk and then‚Äîas a good omen‚Äîsormeh is applied around the eyes. Handfuls of wild marjoram, lotus and sugar plum seeds are thrown over one another's heads while they embrace one another. In 1960s the Postal Service in Tehran issued a series of stamps to commemorate Mehrgan Festival. Basis for the date As noted above, MehrgƒÅn is a name-day feast. These name-day feasts are festivals celebrated on the day of the year when the day-name and month-name dedicated to a particular angel or virtue intersect. Indeed, Zoroastrian Persians before Islam had 30-days months, which means that each day in a month had a different name, with 12 of the days also being names of the 12 months. The day whose name corresponded to the name of the month was celebrated. It was a celebration of life, seasons changing, God, and joy. In Zoroastrianism, happiness is very important and is considered as a holy virtue that must be attracted. Thus, this religion has always had many feasts and celebrations. What that day corresponds to in another calendar is subject to which variant of the Zoroastrian calendar is followed: *The Fasili and Bastani variants of the religious calendar adhere to Gregorian intercalation (leap-day) rules, and therefore MehregƒÅn is celebrated on a day that is fixed in relation to the Gregorian calendar. MehrgƒÅn is then always on October 8. *The Shahanshahi and Kadmi variants of the religious calendar do not intercalate at all, with the result that over the last 14 centuries, MehrgƒÅn has fallen behind and is now either 7th (Shahenshahi) or 8th (Kadmi) months before the same date in the Fasili and Bastani variants. The Bastani calendar is used primarily in Greater Iran and by Persians of the diaspora, while Zoroastrians of India (subject to calendrical faction) use one of the other three variants. Non-Zoroastrian Iranians do not observe any variant of the Zoroastrian calendar, but instead use Iranian calendars. When introduced in 1925, the Zoroastrian festival days were pegged to the Bastani variant of the Zoroastrian calendar. The first six months of the civil calendar had 31 days each, while all Zoroastrian calendar months have 30 days each. So by the 7th month (Mehr) there is a difference of 6 days between the two. Thus, October 8, which in the Bastani/Fasili calendar is the 16th day of Mehr month, is in the Persian civil calendar the 10th day (Aban) of the same month. The relationship between MehregƒÅn and the various calendars is perhaps better understood relative to Nowruz. When (relative to another calendar) the first day of the year occurs is subject to interpretation, but independent of when it occurs, MehregƒÅn is celebrated 195 days after that, that is on the 196th day of the year.

He is considered the champion of Croatian modernist literature, opening Croatia to the currents of European modernism. Life Mato≈° was born in Tovarnik, in the eastern Croatian region of Syrmia on 13 June 1873. In September 1875, when he was two years old, his parents moved to Zagreb, where he went to primary and secondary school. His attempt to study at the Military Veterinary College in Vienna in 1891 ended in failure due to an illness. He was conscripted in 1893, but he deserted in August 1894, fleeing from Croatia to ≈†abac and then to Belgrade. He spent the next three years in Belgrade, living in his own words as a \\"cello player, journalist, and man of letters\\". In January 1898 he traveled to Vienna and Munich, stayed for a while in Geneva, and then moved to Paris in 1899, where he would stay for five years. During his stay in Paris, he wrote his greatest stories. In 1904 he returned to Belgrade, visiting Zagreb in secret (as he was still wanted as a deserter) twice that year and again in 1906 and 1907. Finally, in 1908, after thirteen years abroad, he was pardoned and finally settled in Zagreb. In December 1913, as his health was failing, he was admitted to the Sisters of Charity Hospital where he died in March 1914 of throat cancer. He wrote two dozen published or unpublished works: poems, short stories, articles, travelogues, criticisms and disputes.  Writing  Mato≈° is the central figure of Croatian modernism (moderna), a radical change in Croatian literature under European influences, as it quickly absorbed contemporary tendencies and styles such as Symbolism, modernism or impressionism, relying on French literary heritage from Baudelaire to Mallarm√©, Barres and Huysmans. Estheticism and artistic norms became the primary value criterion. National and social activism, which used to be virtually the only measuring stick, became only a part of a wider mission of Croatian writers. After Mato≈°, the writers were not expected to create art for propaganda purposes (except during communism). He entered into Croatian literature in 1892 with a short story called \\"Moƒá savjesti\\" (The Power of Conscience). Its publication is considered the start of Croatian moderna. He wrote down his thoughts on literary creation and role models on several occasions. As for short story writers, I have the greatest affection for Poe's genius and the superior, concise precision of Merim√©e and the natural feel of Maupassant's satire, he told his friend Milan Ogrizoviƒá in a letter. He developed his affection for Poe via Charles Baudelaire's French translation of Poe's work. =Fiction= His short stories are usually divided into two groups, based primarily on his themes, but also his techniques, methods and styles: * realistic stories taking place in local settings of Zagreb and Zagorje and with characters taken from real life, * bizarre tales with weird, individualist characters. Both groups share a strong lyrical note and love plots. They were created in parallel, at the same time, which indicates that it was no \\"evolution\\" of Mato≈° as a storyteller, but that he strove to use different subjects for his \\"studies in style\\", as he described them. Many elements of his stories with Croatian themes, such as the social problems of his time, spilled into his cycle of grotesque fantasies. That cycle, however, mainly explores the themes of mysterious love, death and nocturnal states and phenomena. For that purpose, Mato≈° reduced the plot, deeply analyzed the individual destinies of his heroes, removed superficial and anecdotal elements, and introduced implausible events and bizarre characters. Such tales push psychological motives to the forefront, while the social element becomes secondary. Because of all this, the grotesque tales abandoned the regional and national for the cosmopolitan. In his travelogues, Mato≈° was one of the greatest Croatian innovators. Landscape, not as a part of a tale, but as an independent subject, was introduced by Mato≈° to the Croatian literature under the influence of Barres. His landscapes are not external images, but active settings in which the author moves. In fact, their purpose is not only to evoke feelings, but also to develop associations that lead to thoughts about wildly different issues. Such clearly impressionist strategy, which uses the landscape for emotional excitement that spills over to all kinds of topics, is a typical feature of almost all the prose works of Mato≈°. He wrote many exceptional travelogues where the landscape is the only subject, the most famous being Oko Lobora (Around Lobor). = Poetry = While he wrote and published short stories, travelogues, criticisms and articles over his entire career, Mato≈° started seriously writing and publishing poetry in his late period, around 1906, and wrote only around 100 poems. There can be no doubt that his great mentor was Baudelaire, since he took many formal elements from the great poet and wrote enthusiastically about Baudelaire on several occasions. The style of his poetry is marked by the predilection for the sonnet form, the gift for the musical qualities of verses, the harmony of words, colors and smells (synesthetic metaphor), a very refined rhythm, and the mix of talking and singing intonation. His main poetic themes in the early phase are love and flower, as he merges the abstract quality of love with the concrete poetic symbol of flowers. Another recurrent theme is death, which suffuses his poems with an elegiac quality, an intense feeling of transience and passing, a merging of dreams and reality, with stifled colors and sounds, and the experience of love as pain. His best love poems are Samotna ljubav (Lonely Love), Djevojƒçici mjesto igraƒçke (To a Child Instead of a Toy), Utjeha kose (Comfort of Hair). He wrote some of the best landscape poetry in Croatian literature, reflecting his emotional states in poetic landscapes of Jesenje veƒçe (Autumn Evening) or Notturno. On the other hand, he also used poems to express his patriotic feelings. In his best patriotic poems ‚Äì Stara pjesma (Old Song), 1909 and Iseljenik (Immigrant) ‚Äì the poet, who returned to his homeland in 1908, shows his disappointment with the Croats under Hungarian oppression. = Literary criticism = Mato≈° left a deep impression on the literary genres of criticism, essay and newspaper article. While using a strong impressionist approach to the works of Croatian (Kranjƒçeviƒá, Vidriƒá, Domjaniƒá, Kamov) and Serbian writers (Sremac, Veselinoviƒá, Panduroviƒá), Mato≈° often stated his own artistic beliefs in his articles. Since he believed art meant beauty, he considered the intensity of poet's expression or the individual writer's style as the main criterion for the valuation of literature. For this reason, he made no difference between genres: fiction, poetry and criticism are all just art, which should primarily reflect the individual character of the artist and their ability for original expression. Still, despite such general criteria, he never neglected the national element when analyzing Croatian writers.

Centres of worship Antenociticus appears at only one site in Britain, the fort of Condercum, on Hadrian's Wall, where three altars to the god were found within the ruins of a small temple. This god is not mentioned on any known Roman altarstones from the continent, and is therefore thought to be a native British deity. The fact that the god is revered at Benwell (1327 [et Num Aug], 1328, 1329 [c.AD175-7]) by a legionary legate, the tribune of an auxiliary infantry cohort and the prefect of an auxiliary cavalry ala, lends credence to this assumption, and perhaps proves that the god was not transferred here as the patron deity of an auxiliary regiment.HISTORY OF BENWELL ROMAN TEMPLE: THE TEMPLE AND ITS DEDICATIONS from www.english-heritage.org.uk by Paul Bidwell, Head of TWM Archaeology, a section of Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums. accessed online May 14, 2015 The sandstone head of the statue of Antenociticus was discovered in 1862 at the temple in Benwell. A torc can be seen around the neck, and the hair on the head curls forward so as to resemble two horns. Parts of the lower leg and forearm of the statue were also found, indicating that a life-sized statue of the god once stood in the temple. The small temple of Antenociticus stands in the vicus (civilian settlement) outside Benwell (Condercum) Fort, one of 13 permanent forts added to the line of Hadrian‚Äôs Wall during its construction. The temple was built in about AD 178-80, probably to mark the promotion of the Roman cavalry prefect who dedicated one of three altars in the temple to Antenociticus. It is thought Antenociticus was possibly worshipped as a source of inspiration and intercession in military matters. Antenociticus is not mentioned at any other Romano-British site or on any inscriptions from the Continent, hence his identification as a local deity.Archaeologists unearth carved head of Roman god in ancient rubbish dump, Durham University Press Release.

Early life and education Hetzel was born in London to Elinor Hetzel (n√©e Watt) and Kenneth Stuart Hetzel, an anaesthetist. Hetzel's parents were originally from South Australia but in London at the time while Kenneth worked at the University College Hospital. They returned to Adelaide in 1925. There he, along with his brother Peter (born 1924), was schooled at King's College and St Peter's College, Adelaide. Hetzel studied medicine at the University of Adelaide from 1940 to 1944. As a medical student, he was granted reserved occupation status during World War II. He later applied to join the Royal Australian Air Force as a medical officer but was denied on grounds of being unfit due to a long bout of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1945. He was a Fulbright Research Scholar in the 1950s which included an appointment at New York Hospital. In 1954, Hetzel and his family travelled to London where he undertook a Research Fellowship in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at St Thomas' Hospital. Career His first job after completing medical studies was as a Resident Medical Officer at Parkside Mental Hospital from 1946 to 1947. Upon completion of his Fulbright Scholar commitments, Hetzel was appointed as the first Michell Research Scholar at the University of Adelaide, where he remained for three years. He then undertook the role of Reader in Medicine at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide before moving to Monash University as the Foundation Professor of Social and Preventive Medicine. In 2001, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital established the Basil Hetzel Institute for Medical Research in his honour. In 1956, Hetzel became a founding member of the South Australian Mental Health Association, and along with other members, went on to assist with the establishment of the crisis support service Lifeline which still runs today. He also held the position of first chief of the CSIRO Division of Human Nutrition. Hetzel was the Chancellor of the University of South Australia from 1992, shortly after its establishment, until 1998. In 2005, the building for health sciences at the university's City East campus was named the Basil Hetzel building and the campus library also has a Hetzel room which contains a collection of his research. Hetzel was Lieutenant Governor of South Australia from April 1992 to May 2000. He was chair of the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre from 1998 to 2007. =Research= Hetzel worked in remote areas of Papua New Guinea with the Public Health Department of the then Territory, and his research concluded that the endemic goitre and associated cretinism was attributable to an iodine deficient diet. He also demonstrated that dietary supplementation would entirely prevent these illnesses. In the 1980s Hetzel, supported by the Australian Agency for International Development, became an international advocate for iodine supplementation, which is now taken for granted with iodinated table salt. This was part of the stimulus for the creation of the Iodine Global Network, then called the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), which is funded by various government, non-government and community organisations including the United Nations, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank. The ICCIDD is considered the expert body regarding iodine deficiency disorders and they implement national programs for the prevention of iodine deficiency. As a result of their advocacy, many countries have now legislated that salt for human and animal consumption must be iodised. Much of this success has been attributed to Hetzel's \\"indefatigable dedication to elimination of iodine deficiency disorders.\\" In 2010, the ICCIDD established a Basil Hetzel International Award for Communications for individuals who contribute to promoting awareness of iodine nutrition. It is claimed that iodine supplementation has been achieved in 70% of households worldwide by 2000. In the 1960s, he led research in Papua New Guinea that identified the link between iodine deficiency and significant brain damage in unborn children. Personal life Hetzel married Mary Helen Eyles in 1946. Together they had five children; Susan (born 1947), Richard (born 1949), Robert (born 1951), Jay (born 1952) and Elizabeth (born 1956). Helen died of cancer in December 1980. In 1983 Hetzel married again, to Anne Fisher. Hetzel was a member of Pilgrim Uniting Church in Adelaide. Hetzel died on 4 February 2017, aged 94.

His literary work was small, but very significant, because in his poems and plays he expressed his anger and displeasure over hypocrisy and injustice of his contemporaries in a way unprecedented in Croatian literature. His masterwork is a modernist novel Isu≈°ena kalju≈æa (1906‚Äì1909) saturated with psychosexual and spiritual conflicts of the iconoclastic first-person narrator and later described as a proto-existentialist prose, written decades before the literary movement's appearance. Kamov's novel, invariably described as the premier Croatian avant-garde major prose work, was printed for the first time in 1956. Because of that he earned reputation as one of the greatest rebels and iconoclasts in history of Croatian culture. Biography He was born in Su≈°ak, Rijeka. Rebellious by nature, he was expelled from Rijeka high school and dropped out of the school in Zagreb. Because of his participation in the demonstration against the Hungarian governor in Croatia, Khuen-H√©derv√°ry, he was sentenced to three months in prison in 1903. Headstrong and temperamental, he called himself Kamov, after Ham (or Kam) from the Old Testament, who saw his father Noah naked but unlike his siblings Shem and Japhet did not cover his nakedness, thus issuing a curse. Kamov probably saw himself as a revealer of bourgeoise hypocrisy and wrote to his brother Vladimir in 1910 - \\"Kamov to me is a literary program...\\" He died at the age of 23 in Barcelona and was buried at the hospital cemetery near Hospital de la Santa Creu. Legacy Kamov is treated as a very special writer within Croatian literature. (CROLIB).His writings have been variously labeled as proto-modernist, avant- garde, absurdist, existentialist, futurist and surrealist, and is considered to be a highly original author for the period.The Curse, Janko Polic Kamov, foreword by Martin Mayhewhttps://www.avantgarde- museum.com/en/museum/projects/standstill/artists/Janko-Polic-Kamov~pe4315/ His work paved way and influenced later Croatian authors such as Miroslav Krle≈æa and Antun Branko ≈†imiƒá.https://hbl.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=11888 A number of his works have been translated into English during the 90s such as Sloboda (Freedom) or ≈Ωalost (Sorrow)https://www.matica.hr/hr/584/janko-polic-kamov- samoca-visina-i-vjecnost-literata-29396/, which led the American literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman to describe him as the biggest literary discovery during that period.https://glashrvatske.hrt.hr/hr/dozivi/ljudi/janko-polic- kamov-nikada-do-kraja-shvacen-ni- prihvacen/https://www.matica.hr/vijenac/236/budimpesta-1909-12821/ Works =Poetry= *Psovka (Curse), (Zagreb, 1907) *I≈°tipana hartija, (Zagreb, 1907) =Short stories= *ƒÜaskanja, Izdanje knji≈æare G.

S√©bastien Faure (born 6 January 1858 in Saint-√âtienne, Loire, France; died 14 July 1942 in Royan, Charente- Maritime, France) was a French anarchist, freethought and secularist activist and a principal proponent of synthesis anarchism.\\"Especifismo and Synthesis/ Synthesism\\" by Felipe Corr√™aJason Garner. \\"La b√∫squeda de la unidad anarquista: la Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica antes de la II Rep√∫blica.\\"  Biography  Before becoming a free-thinker, Faure was a seminarist. He engaged in politics as a socialist before turning to anarchism in 1888. In 1894, he was prosecuted in \\"The Trial of the thirty\\" (\\"Proc√®s des trente\\"), but was acquitted. In 1895, he cofounded \\"Le Libertaire\\" with Louise Michel, taking the name of the earlier journal by Joseph D√©jacque. At the time of the Dreyfus affair, he was one of the leading supporters of Alfred Dreyfus. In 1904, he created a libertarian school called \\"La Ruche\\" (The Hive) close to Rambouillet. In 1916, he launched the periodical \\"Ce qu'il faut dire\\". Faure also co-founded (with Voline) the Synthesis, or also known as synthesis anarchism which was an influential form of conceiving anarchist federations.\\"Especifismo and Synthesis/ Synthesism\\" by Felipe Corr√™aJason Garner. \\"La b√∫squeda de la unidad anarquista: la Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica antes de la II Rep√∫blica.\\" In 1918, he was imprisoned for organizing an illegal meeting. He is recognized for his pedagogy and his qualities as a speaker, and is the author of several books: * The universal pain (1895) * My Communism (1921) * The Forces Of The Revolution (1921) * Religious imposture (1923) * Subversive remarks * Twelve Proofs of God's Inexistence (1908) He was also the founder of the Anarchist encyclopedia, as well as the namesake of the S√©bastien Faure Century, the French-speaking contingent of the Durruti Column during the civil war in Spain.  Synthesis anarchism  The discussion about the Anarchist Synthesis arises in the context of the discussion on the Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists, written by the Dielo Truda group of Russian exiles in 1926.\\"Especifismo and Synthesis/ Synthesism\\" by Felipe Corr√™a Two texts made as responses to the Platform, each proposing a different organizational model, became the basis for what is known as the organisation of synthesis, or simply \\"synthesism\\".\\"Especifismo and Synthesis/ Synthesism\\" by Felipe Corr√™a Voline published in 1924 a paper calling for \\"the anarchist synthesis\\" and was also the author of the article in S√©bastien Faure's Encyclopedie Anarchiste on the same topic.\\"J.3.2 What are \\"synthesis\\" federations?\\" in An Anarchist FAQ The main purpose behind the synthesis was that the anarchist movement in most countries was divided into three main tendencies: communist anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, and individualist anarchism\\"J.3.2 What are \\"synthesis\\" federations?\\" in An Anarchist FAQ and so such an organization could contain anarchists of these three tendencies very well. The platformists wanted to push their ideas forward through organizing an international anarchist congress on 12 February 1927.Jason Garner. \\"La b√∫squeda de la unidad anarquista: la Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica antes de la II Rep√∫blica.\\" Shortly later in the National Congress of the French Anarchist Union (UAF), the Dielo Truda Group achieved making their platform more popular and so they made the UAF change its name into Revolutionary Anarcho-Communist Union (UACR). S√©bastien Faure led a faction within the UACR that decided to separate themselves from this organization and form outside it the Association of Federalist Anarchists (AFA), thinking that traditional anarchist ideas were being threatened by the Dielo Truda platform.\\"Tras la victoria de los plataformistas en el Congreso de Par√≠s de 1929, una secci√≥n de los que consideraron que las ideas tradicionales del anarquismo estaban siendo atacadas se separ√≥ de la UACR para formar la Asociaci√≥n de los Federalistas Anarquistas a comienzos de 192821. La principal figura de la AFA fue S√©bastien Faure que, como respuesta a la Plataforma, expuso sus propuestas para un movimiento anarquista unificado en La s√≠ntesis anarquista, que apareci√≥ primero como un suplemento del informe de la AFA de febrero de 1928 titulado Le Trait d‚ÄôUnion Libertaire\\"Jason Garner. \\"La b√∫squeda de la unidad anarquista: la Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica antes de la II Rep√∫blica.\\" Shortly later in his text \\"Anarchist synthesis\\" he exposes the view that \\"these currents were not contradictory but complementary, each having a role within anarchism: anarcho-syndicalism as the strength of the mass organisations and the best way for the practice of anarchism; libertarian communism as a proposed future society based on the distribution of the fruits of labour according to the needs of each one; anarcho-individualism as a negation of oppression and affirming the individual right to development of the individual, seeking to please them in every way.\\"Especifismo and Synthesis/ Synthesism\\" by Felipe Corr√™a Sebastian Faure had strong contacts in Spain and so his proposal had more impact with Spanish anarchists than the Dielo Truda platform even though individualist anarchist influence in Spain was less strong than it was in France. The main goal there was reconciling anarcho-communism with anarcho-syndicalism.\\"Debido a sus contactos e influencia con el movimiento del exilio espa√±ol, la propuesta de Faure arraig√≥ m√°s en los c√≠rculos espa√±oles que la Plataforma, y fue publicada en las prensas libertarias tanto en Espa√±a como en B√©lgica25. En esencia, Faure intentaba reunir a la familia anarquista sin imponer la r√≠gida estructura que propon√≠a la Plataforma, y en Espa√±a se acept√≥ as√≠. Opuesta a la situaci√≥n de Francia, en Espa√±a la influencia del anarquismo individualista no fue un motivo serio de ruptura. Aunque las ideas de ciertos individualistas como Han Ryner y √âmile Armand tuvieron cierto impacto sobre el anarquismo espa√±ol, afectaron s√≥lo a aspectos como el sexo y el amor libre.\\"Jason Garner. \\"La b√∫squeda de la unidad anarquista: la Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica antes de la II Rep√∫blica.\\"  Views  Faure's view of pedagogy was that every single aspect of a human being had to be developed. Faure identified three aspects: physical, mental and moral. He thought that a man or a woman needed to be able to accomplish physical, manual tasks as well as to have a minimum of culture and think and be able to develop ideas. All this in a respectful, mutual, equal and free environment.  La Ruche  Created in 1904, the source of capital for La Ruche (The Hive) at the beginning was the product of Faure's seminars. It became self-sufficient in three years' time. Its founding principles were similar to Proudhon's Permanent Education and Paul Robin's \\"good birth, good education and good social organisation.\\" The three main spheres of pedagogy were fulfilled through classes, work in the field and all the different activities necessary to ensure the self-sufficiency of the Hive. The moral values were implemented through respect of the child's autonomy, positive method, absence of ranking or any form of categorization (except some activities were reserved to particular groups of age), coeducation, and sexual education (all activities being mixed.)

(in Swedish) The two municipalities Emmaboda and Nybro belong to Kalmar County and Lessebo and Uppvidinge belong to Kronoberg County. The area is part of the province Sm√•land, and Nybro is considered the capital of the Kingdom of Crystal area. The Kingdom of Crystal is known for its handblown glass with a continuous story since 1742.The glassworks have become part of the culture of Sweden; examples can be found in many Swedish homes, recognisable by a small sticker at the bottom with the name Orrefors, Kosta, etc. The height of glass production was the end of the 19th century during which 77 glass factories were established with more than half of them situated in Sm√•land. When touring the forested province of Sm√•land in Sweden, it is normal to visit at least one of the glassworks. The larger ones have adjacent museums and are open for visitors to see the glass blowing hall, normally looking down from a platform. Food is available as well as shopping for all kinds of glass products such as glasses, bowls, vases and unique glass ornaments. The Kingdom of Crystal is a popular and a well known tourist destination. The Regional Council of Kalmar County conducts a study every four years to survey the Swedish public regarding their knowledge and awareness about Kalmar County, its places to visit and tourist attractions. The survey was conducted by Kantar Sifo and included 1500 respondents aged 20-79 years old. The survey results found that the Kingdom of Crystal area was the most visited tourist attraction in the Kalmar County attracting a wide group of people.

He managed to walk away from the hoax with more than half a million dollars. Biography Arnold was a poorly educated hatter's apprentice when he enlisted to serve in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He then went to California as part of the Gold Rush of 1849. He apparently met with some success there, as he was able to return to his native Kentucky, buy a farm, marry, and start a family. By 1870, he had returned to the West to take a job as a miner and prospector. He and his cousin John Slack obtained some industrial-grade diamonds from their friend James B. Cooper, then an assistant bookkeeper for the Diamond Drill Company of San Francisco. They mixed the diamonds in with garnets, rubies, and sapphires he bought from Indians in Arizona. Arnold and Slack took their bag of jewels to the office of local businessman George D. Roberts, whom they convinced that they had found them in a previously- undiscovered deposit. They swore Roberts to secrecy and asked him to store the gems in his office. But, Roberts could not keep a secret and eventually drew several other men into Arnold's trap, including: William C. Ralston, founder of the Bank of California; Asbury Harpending; William Lent; and General George S. Dodge. Together, they put together an offer to buy out Arnold and Slack, and gave them a $50,000 down payment. Arnold and Slack used the money to go to England and acquire additional uncut gems, valued at about $20,000. Some would go back to San Francisco to further convince Roberts and his investment group. Others would be planted for later discovery. In the meantime, Ralston and the others sent a sample of Arnold's gems to New York City for inspection by Charles Lewis Tiffany. Tiffany set up a meeting at the Madison Avenue home of attorney Samuel Barlow, to solicit additional investors. They included such notable figures as George B. McClellan, U.S. Congressman Benjamin Franklin Butler, and Horace Greeley. Tiffany grossly overestimated the value of the stones at $150,000‚Äîfar more than the $20,000 Arnold had actually spent to acquire them in England. This quickly netted the conman an additional $100,000 from the new investors, which he took back to London. There he acquired $8,000 in more uncut gems to keep their attention. Eventually, the investors demanded to visit the source of these gems and Arnold and Slack planted their diamonds on a remote location in northwest Colorado Territory. They led the investors west from St. Louis in June 1872. Arriving at the town of Rawlins, in the Wyoming Territory, they continued on horseback. But Arnold and Slack wanted to keep the exact location a secret, so they led the group on a confusing four- day journey through the countryside. On June 4, 1872, Arnold, Slack and company finally reached the spot where they had previously planted some gems and encouraged the investors to begin digging. For more than an hour, precious stones were found in abundance. And, before all was said and done, they had given Arnold $450,000 for the remainder of his rights to any future claim on the property. The hoax was not discovered until October 1872, when the United States Department of the Interior sent a survey team, led by geologist Clarence King of Yale University, to inspect the site. King soon deduced that the various stones were formed under different conditions and would never be found together in a single deposit.King, Clarence. 1872.

In the meantime, Arnold took his proceeds from the scheme and bought a two-story brick house in his native Elizabethtown, as well as some five hundred acres of nearby farmland‚Äîall of which he had deeded in the name of his wife Mary. In 1873, Arnold decided to go into the banking business himself, buying a defunct Elizabethtown financial institution. But, in 1878, he became embroiled in a feud with another banker in town that resulted in a serious shotgun wound to his shoulder. He died six months later of pneumonia, at age 49.

At Boys High School in Atlanta, he averaged 171 rushing yards per game and scored 102 points. In 1942, freshmen were ruled eligible to play varsity ball as college rosters were drained by World War II, which allowed Castleberry to display his spectacular prowess early. On October 3, 1942, Georgia Tech beat Notre Dame for the first time since 1928, especially impressive as the game was played in South Bend and Notre Dame had not lost a game in two years. Castleberry led Georgia Tech in both passing and rushing yards, even after Notre Dame head coach Frank Leahy had been warned by a scout that Castleberry was \\"the most dangerous runner in America.\\" Against national power Navy, Castleberry led Tech to an impressive shutout win on October 24 in Annapolis, broadcast worldwide via the Armed Forces Radio Network. The momentum changer of the game occurred when Navy was driving for a score near the Tech goal line. Castleberry was put in to play defense on a passing situation on fourth down. He anticipated the Navy pass and stepped in front of the intended receiver for an interception. He scampered away with a dazzling run of 95 yards for a touchdown. Tech coach Bobby Dodd described it as ‚Äúa magnificent run that I can still follow step by step in my mind. It shook Navy to its keel, and Tech won 21-0.‚Äù Dodd called it Castleberry‚Äôs greatest play. The national press began to take notice of Castleberry. Georgia Tech won its first nine games and climbed to a top five national ranking. During that ninth win, Castleberry injured his knee in a hard-fought 20‚Äì7 win over Florida in Atlanta. Despite the injury, Castleberry played in the final two games of the season, but not quite at full speed, and Georgia Tech dropped both. On New Year's Day, Tech traveled to the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, but lost a tight game to Texas, 14‚Äì7. Castleberry's injury improved for the bowl game, yet he was still not quite a hundred percent and the team finished at 9‚Äì2. Castleberry was third in the Heisman Trophy voting, behind winner Frank Sinkwich of Georgia and runner-up Paul Governali of Columbia, both seniors. This was the highest a freshman had ever placed in the Heisman voting. Castleberry's number 19 is the only football jersey Georgia Tech has ever retired. Army Air Forces Georgia Tech listing Clint Castleberry After the Cotton Bowl, Castleberry enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces in early 1943 and planned to return to play football at Georgia Tech after the war. He underwent surgery on February 2 at the Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta to repair his damaged knee. Castleberry withdrew from Georgia Tech on February 18 and reported for military duty in Miami. After a physical evaluation by Army doctors, it was determined that he was fit for service. Castleberry completed Army flight school training and earned his wings in the summer of 1944 and was sent to the Mediterranean theater in the fall. He co-piloted a B-26 Marauder bomber known as \\"Dream Girl\\" and was stationed in Africa. In the early morning hours of November 7, Lt. Castleberry took off from Roberts Field in Liberia with another B-26 to continue a ferrying run up the coast toward Dakar, Senegal. Neither of the two planes made it to their destination. An extensive six-day search involving American and British search crews was conducted. On November 23, 1944, all crew members were officially re-classified from MIA to KNB (killed, no body) after a Royal Air Force plane observed unidentified wreckage believed to have been from the missing planes.

He was a brother of Oskar Adler.  Life  Max Adler obtained his doctorate in law in 1896, and became a professional lawyer. He began to teach in the ‚ÄúSch√∂nbrunn Circle‚Äù in the early summer of 1919. Max Winter, the deputy mayor of Vienna, was able to make rooms available in the main building of Sch√∂nbrunn Castle for the Kinderfreunde √ñsterreich (an Austrian association for children and families). In the Sch√∂nbrunner Erzieherschule, where young people were trained to be teachers, Max Adler and his colleagues Wilhelm Jerusalem, Alfred Adler, Marianne Pollak, Josef Luitpold Stern and Otto Felix Kanitz were able to realize practical educational reforms.

From 1919 to 1921 he was a Social-Democratic member of the regional parliament of Nieder√∂sterreich.landtag-noe.at Adler was active in Adult Education, and from 1904 to 1925, with Rudolf Hilferding, editor of \\"Marx-Studien\\".  Works  Sozialistische Idee der Befreiung bei Karl Marx, 1918 Max Adler's first theoretical work of note was a study \\"Max Stirner. Ein Beitrag zur Feststellung des Verh√§ltnisses von Socialismus und Individualismus\\" (1894). The title sets the agenda for Adler's later theoretical activities. Although this study of Marx's scorned opponent seriously antagonized Marxist Party theorists, and so remained unpublished, Stirner remained an influence on Adler's thinking throughout his life. Adler's biographer Alfred Pfabigan, upon sight of his unpublished papers, was surprised by his ‚Äúintellectual relationship with Stirner owing to its high degree of continuity‚Äù.Alfred Pfabigan: Max Adler. Frankfurt/Main: Campus 1982, p. 15 Because Adler wanted to operate within the framework of the rising Social Democratic movement, he was highly circumspect in his subsequent references to Stirner, and, while continuing to accord him great significance as Marx's ‚Äúpsychological counterpart‚Äù, initially adopted most aspects of the doctrine of Historical Materialism: the essence of history is class struggle, and its realization entails a union of theory with revolutionary practice. He envisaged ‚Äúever greater harmony and perfection‚Äù arising from the contradictions inherent in the then state of society, until the proletariat, in the course of its revolution, would finally see ‚Äúthe pursuit of its own class interests‚Äù coincide with ‚Äúthe solidarity of society‚Äù. In a departure from orthodox Marxism, Adler's conception reduces the dialectic to a mere sociological methodology, not expressive of any specific dialectic intrinsic to the historical process. In common with other theorists of the Second International, such as Karl Kautsky and Karl Liebknecht, Adler also rejects the association between Scientific Socialism and Materialism: true Marxism was ‚Äúin reality social idealism‚Äú. For Adler, Historical Materialism essentially becomes subjective idealism. In all consistency, his particular interest then turned to producing an epistemological critique of Sociology, combining Marxist themes with Kantian transcendentalism. According to Adler, ‚Äúthe individual consciousness is a priori socialized‚Äù, insofar as every logical judgement already and necessarily includes reference to a multitude of assenting subjects; Adler's ‚Äòsocial a priori‚Äô transcendentally implies the possibility of social reality. Adler's contributions to a Marxist general theory of the state emerged in the course of disputes with Hans Kelsen and Hermann Heller. Criticizing the formal concept of democracy, Adler distinguished between political democracy, as a manifestation of the hegemony of the bourgeoisie, and a social democracy, in which oppression was to be removed along with social differences, the whole to be replaced by ‚Äúsolidarity-based administrative reform‚Äù of society. For Adler, the establishment of a socialist society remained linked to the ‚Äòdismantling of the machinery of the state‚Äô along Marxist lines. Adler the politician permitted no compromises with the so-called \\"social chauvinism\\", or majority- Socialist ‚Äúreformism‚Äù. Not the least important aspect of the Austromarxism espoused by Adler, Otto Bauer and Rudolf Hilferding was its relevance to the discussions on the left wing of German Social Democracy before 1933.

This culture's home world was located between Mars and Jupiter, and in their ongoing civil war against each other, they wrought great damage on Mars, which used to be a far more temperate, colonized Earthlike planet before its atmosphere was destroyed in the same conflict that also utterly destroyed their home planet, its remains eventually becoming the asteroid belt. This last act was apparently a threshold event of some kind that caused the culture to lay down their arms, possibly out of shame or out of fear of some kind of reprisal. As a result, they put themselves and their technology in suspended animation deep within Europa's ocean. One of the Cold Harbor scientists suggests that this was motivated chiefly by their inability to live with themselves. However, before doing so, the culture seeded Earth with the genetic material that allowed human life to grow. However, thanks to the unscrupulous acts of the insane manager of a weapons testing facility also in orbit around Europa, owned by an interplanetary corporation named Doors, the race starts to wake up, putting the Earth itself at risk from the resurgence of the extremely powerful and violent precursor race, and Nathan and the Harbor scientists are practically the only ones that can stop them. Collected editions A trade paperback collection of the series was published by Wildstorm in 2005 (). DC imprint Vertigo released a Deluxe Edition in 2015 that Ocean combined into one hardcover volume with Ellis' Orbiter, that was originally published by Vertigo (). Film The comic has been optioned by Gianni Nunnari and Nick Wechsler who have history with films based on comics, the former produced 300 and the duo are slated to produce the film based on Ronin. Ryan Condal, writer of the spec script Galahad, has been approached by Warner Brothers to produce a screenplay for them.

The magazine is published monthly, and is sold in retail outlets and on subscription in both print and digital. It contains illustrated articles on people, places, adventure, travel, and environmental issues, as well as summarising the latest academic research and discoveries in geography.

It is located west of Pozna≈Ñ city centre. It takes its name from the neighborhood of ≈Åawica, part of the city's Grunwald district, while the airport actually lies in the Je≈ºyce district. Synopsis Check-in hall The northern section has been used as a military airport since its inception in 1913 as an Imperial German airbase until 23 December 2009. The southern section is used for civilian purposes. The prospect of relocating the airport elsewhere is often raised as a result of the flight path to the runway being located directly over the city. The airport caters for international, domestic and cargo flights and general aviation. A new terminal was opened in 2012 and can handle up to 3.5 million passengers per year.Emilia Derewienko, \\"Rekordowy lipiec na lotnisku w Poznaniu\\", Rynek Lotniczy, 14.08.2018 Confusion with Pozna≈Ñ‚ÄìKrzesiny military airport Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica airport has been confused by pilots with a nearby airbase, Pozna≈Ñ‚ÄìKrzesiny Airbase (ICAO code: EPKS), which also has a runway. The runways are at approximately the same orientation: ≈Åawica's is 11/29 (true heading: 108/288) and Krzesiny's is 12/30 (true heading: 117.9/297.9). The two runways lie in a nearly straight line, with Krzesiny coming up first on approaches from the east, the ones used most often. On the other hand, the Krzesiny airbase has two runways and lies southeast from the city centre, while Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica lies just west of it. One notable incident involving confusion between ≈Åawica and Krzesiny happened on August 15, 2006, when a Sky Airlines aircraft - a Boeing 737-800 running flight number SKY335 - mistook the runway at Krzesiny for the one being used in ≈Åawica, landing at the military base by accident. The aircraft later took off on a repositioning flight to the correct airfield. According to Krzysztof Krawcewicz, a pilot and the editor-in-chief of the Polish monthly PrzeglƒÖd Lotniczy/Aviation Revue, this was at least the seventh mistaken aircraft that landed at the Pozna≈Ñ‚ÄìKrzesiny airfield in 2006 alone. He faults, among others, the \\"scandalous procedures which are in use by the air traffic control at Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica\\" and the lack of radar use in controlling aircraft landing, which, although a radar system is present at ≈Åawica, has been shut off, most likely due to the nearby military base. Airlines and destinations Incidents and accidents * On 10 June 1952, a Petlyakov Pe-2 bomber from the 21st Reconnaissance Regiment took off from ≈Åawica air base for a training flight, but crashed shortly thereafter near the Warta river as a result of engine failure. The crash killed the bomber's crew: chorƒÖ≈ºy Zdzis≈Çaw Lara (pilot), chorƒÖ≈ºy Stanis≈Çaw Kuƒá (navigator) and corporal J√≥zef Bednarek (rear gunner/radio operator), as well as six civilians on the ground. Due to the fact that the aircraft was made in the Soviet Union, the crash was covered up by the Communist authorities and the official reports put the blame on the pilot instead of equipment. In 2008, a monument was unveiled at the crash site.Semczuk, Przemys≈Çaw Zatajone katastrofy PRL-u (Secret Disasters of Communist Poland), Ringier Axel Springer Polska, Warsaw 2011; chapter Kula ognia (Fireball), p. 13-21 Public ground transportation Pozna≈Ñ transit (MPK Pozna≈Ñ) lines number 159 and 242 stop at the arrival area of the airport and provide a connection to Pozna≈Ñ G≈Ç√≥wny railway station.

It is an arcade-style flight combat game, with simpler game controls and physics than flight simulators. It is known for its fast, high-energy action sequences, compared to flight simulators of the time. Terminal Reality also developed a similar game, Fury3, published that same year by Microsoft. It used the same game engine and basic game mechanics, but was designed to run natively on the new Windows 95 operating system. Though considered to add little to the gameplay of Terminal Velocity, Fury3 spawned an add-on pack, F!Zone, as well as a sequel, Hellbender. In 2015, co-founder of Terminal Reality, the game's original developer Mark Randel, released a version for Android and iOS, published by Trebuchet Entertainment. Gameplay Terminal Velocity is a combat flight simulator. The player's craft has no inertia, meaning its course can be changed instantly and can fly at low speeds without falling. There are seven different weapons, ranging from guns, blasters and rockets to homing missiles and a rare secret weapon. Additionally, it possesses powerful afterburners that allow it to move at very high speed, which is useful in order to evade attacks, but sacrifices the ability to return fire temporarily (they can be selected like weapons, and if they are, the fire button will ignite the afterburners). The craft is able to survive some hits, and even some collisions with the terrain, including tunnels. Each of the 27 missions consists of several objectives, e.g. enemies which must be destroyed, tunnel entrances and exits, mere checkpoints, and an extraction point. At the end of each planet is a powerful boss enemy (or more rarely, a weak boss enemy) that must be destroyed before either proceeding to the next planet or completing the episode. Plot The story is set in the year 2704, when the Alliance of Space-Faring Alien Races (ASFAR), of which Earth is a member, suddenly turns against Earth and their fleet ravages the planet, starting a war. The player flies a powerful starfighter, the TV-202, in a series of missions to defeat the enemy. In Episode 3, the player learns that a huge supercomputer known as Xenocidic Initiative (X.I.), located on Proxima Seven, is responsible for the war. Their final mission is to eliminate it. A hidden mission can take place after the main plot only in the CD ROM version where the player must investigate a sudden metamorphosis of an unknown nearby planet and destroy the force that changed the face of the planet. It is revealed here that this force drove a man named Sy Wickens into insanity, and how the X.I. Supercomputer had \\"accidentally\\" digitized Sy Wickens' persona. Development Terminal Velocity (called \\"Velocity Brawl\\" during development) was co-produced by Tom Hall. The main programmer of the game was Mark Randel, the former lead programmer of Microsoft Flight Simulator. The game has three episodes, the first of which was distributed as shareware. Each episode features three different worlds, making a total of nine levels; the only exception is the final planet of Episode 3, Proxima Seven, which has only two stages. At the end of each world is a boss enemy that must be destroyed before proceeding to the next world. Following the release of the shareware version, publisher 3D Realms was inundated with requests that the game be playable with a mouse, leading the company to include a mouse option in the commercial version of the game. The original floppy disk release was followed by a CD-ROM version. The CD-ROM version added 70 MB of extended pre-rendered 3D cut scenes, a bonus hidden planet, higher image resolution (including more detailed textures) and support for 8-player network multiplay. The Macintosh port was published separately by MacSoft. Reception A reviewer for Next Generation, while acknowledging that the game is \\"fun to play\\" and has a uniquely wide variety of open locales, gave it an overall negative review. Arguing that the game is a first-person shooter and that \\"the genre, as currently exploited, is beginning to wear thin\\", he gave it two out of five stars.

All TV related tasks are handled by the server and streamed over the network to one or more clients. Clients can then install the MediaPortal Client software and use the TV-Server to watch live or recorded TV, schedule recordings, view and search EPG data over the network. Since version 1.0.1, the client plugin of the TV-Server has replaced the default built-in TV Engine. Even without a network (i.e. a singleseat installation), the TV-Server treats the PC as both the server and the client. The TV-Server supports watching and recording TV at the same time with only one DVB/ATSC TV Card, on the same transponder (multiplex). Broadcast Driver Architecture is used to support as many TV cards as possible. The major brands of cards, like digital-everywhere, Hauppauge, Pinnacle, TechnoTrend and TechniSat, including analog cards, provide BDA drivers for their cards. Video/DVD player The video player of MediaPortal is a DirectShow Player, so any codec/filter can be used. MediaPortal uses the codec from LAV Filters by default, but the codec can be changed to all installed ones, such like Ffdshow, PowerDVD, CoreAVC, Nvidia PureVideo etc. MediaPortal also support video post-processing, with any installed codec. Due to the DirectShow player implementation, MediaPortal can play all media files that can be played on Windows. Music player The default internal music player uses the BASS Engine with the BASS audio library. The alternative player is the internal DirectShow player. With the BASS Engine MediaPortal supports visualizations from Windows Media Visualizations, Winamp Visualizations including MilkDrop, Sonic and Soundspectrum G-Force. Picture player/organizer Digital pictures/photos can be browsed, managed and played as slide shows with background music or radio.

Known mostly for his early reggae works, he brought a political dimension to this music. His house band was known as The Dynamites. Biography Son of a tailor and builder, Eccles spent his childhood in the countryside of the parish of Saint Mary. Eccles had an itinerant childhood due to his father's need to travel Jamaica seeking work. He used to regularly attend church, and he became influenced by spiritual singing; In his words: \\"One of my uncles was a spiritual revivalist, who always did this heavy type of spiritual singing, and I got to love that\\".Barrow, p.109 Eccles's professional singing career began as a teenager, working the north-coast hotel circuit in the mid-1950s. In his late teens, he moved to Ocho Rios, where he performed at night in various shows, with artists such as The Blues Busters, Higgs & Wilson and Buster Brown. He moved to Kingston in 1959, where he started his recording career. He first recorded for Coxsone Dodd, who had organised a talent show in which Eccles took part.Katz suggests that Eccles won this contest, but Eccles himself has stated that it was won by Tony Gregory. Eccles had a Jamaican hit in 1961 with the early ska song \\"Freedom\\", which was recorded in 1959, and was featured on Dodd's sound system for two years before it was released.Larkin, p.90 It was one of the first Jamaican songs with socially oriented lyrics. The song discussed the concept of repatriation to Africa, an idea developed by the growing Rastafari movement. The song became the first Jamaican hit to be used for political purposes; Alexander Bustamante, founder of the Jamaican Labour Party and at that time Chief Minister of Jamaica adopted it for his fight against the Federation of the West Indies in 1960. In the following years, Eccles had other successful songs, mixing boogie/rhythm and blues influences with ska rhythms, such as \\"River Jordan\\" and \\"Glory Hallelujah\\". In 1962, he started promoting concerts and set up his Christmas Morning talent show; first with Dodd, then on his own.Walters He organised concerts for The Clarendonians in 1963, and for The Wailers in 1964 and 1965. He launched other talent search contests, with Battle of the Stars, Clancy Eccles Revue, Independent Revue and Reggae Soul Revue, from which emerged stars such as Barrington Levy and Culture. Starting in 1963, he recorded with producers such as Charlie Moo (Leslie Kong's business partner) and the husband of Sonia Pottinger, Lyndon. He couldn't make a living from his music, so he quit in 1965 to work as a tailor in Annotto Bay. During this period, he made stage outfits for musicians such as Kes Chin, The Mighty Vikings, Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, Carlos Malcolm and The Blues Busters. He went back to music in 1967, producing his own recordings as well as those of other artists.Thompson, p.310 He scored a hit with Eric 'Monty' Morris' reggae song \\"Say What You're Saying\\", and with his own song \\"Feel The Rhythm\\", one of several records that were instrumental in the shift from rocksteady to reggae.\\"Eccles Goos As Performer, Producer\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 17 August 2014. Retrieved 17 August 2014 Eccles has also been credited with deriving the name 'reggae' from 'streggae', Kingston slang for a good-time girl.Barrow, p.108 Eccles' first hit, \\"What Will Your Mama Say\\" which was released by the recently created United Kingdom label, Pama Records. In 1968, his song \\"Fattie Fattie\\" became a skinhead reggae classic, along with his productions of recordings by the toasting DJ King Stitt (\\"Fire Corner\\", \\"Van Cleef\\", \\"Herbman Shuffle\\"). Eccles recorded many organ-led instrumentals with his session band The Dynamites (same band has Derrick Harriott's ), featuring Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Paul Douglas, Winston Wright, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Grennan, Joe Isaacs, and Hugh Malcolm, with Johnny Moore and Bobby Ellis both contributing trumpet in defferent sessions. In 1970, Eccles helped pave the way to the dub music genre by releasing an instrumental version of \\"Herbman Shuffle\\" called \\"Phantom\\", with a mix focusing on the bass line. Eccles launched different record labels for his works: Clansone, New Beat and Clandisc (the latter also the name of a sub-label set up by Trojan Records for Eccles' UK releases).Larkin, p.91 He recorded artists such as Alton Ellis, Joe Higgs, the Trinidian Lord Creator (\\"Kingston Town\\"), Larry Marshall, Hemsley Morris, Earl Lawrence, The Beltones, Glen Ricks, Cynthia Richards, Buster Brown and Beres Hammond. Appreciated by musicians for his fairness and sense of equity, he helped Lee Perry set up his Upsetter record label in 1968 after Perry left Dodd's employment, and helped Winston 'Niney' Holmes (later known as 'The Observer') record his first hit as a producer in 1971 (\\"Blood & Fire\\").Barrow, p.110 A socialist militant, Eccles was appointed as an adviser on the music industry to Michael Manley's People's National Party (PNP) and took part in Jamaica's 1972 prime ministerial elections by organising a \\"Bandwagon\\" featuring musicians such as Bob Marley & the Wailers, Dennis Brown, Max Romeo, Delroy Wilson and Inner Circle, performing around the island in support of Manley's campaign. Throughout the 1970s, he remained close to Manley and wrote several songs in praise of the PNP program, including his hits \\"Power for the People\\", \\"Rod of Correction\\" or \\"Generation Belly\\". Eccles' political interests meant that he spent less time on music, although in the late 1970s, Eccles had further success as a producer with recordings by Tito Simon and Exuma the Obeah Man, as well as collaborations with King Tubby. After the 1970s, new Eccles recordings were rare, and he concentrated on live concert promotion and re-issues of his back catalogue. In the 1980s, Eccles slowed down his musical activities, and he never met success again, apart from a few political songs, such as \\"Dem Mash Up The Country\\" in 1985.

The Imperial fora (Fori Imperiali in Italian) are a series of monumental fora (public squares), constructed in Rome over a period of one and a half centuries, between 46 BC and 113 AD. The fora were the center of the Roman Republic and of the Roman Empire. The Imperial fora, while not part of the Roman Forum, are located relatively close to each other. Julius Caesar was the first to build in this section of Rome and rearranged both the Forum and the Comitium, another forum type space designated for politics, to do so. These fora were the centres of politics, religion and economy in the ancient Roman Empire. During the early 20th century, Mussolini restored the Imperial Fora as part of his campaign to evoke and emulate the past glories of Ancient Rome. But he also built the Via dei Fori Imperiali across the middle of the site. The modern street and its heavy traffic has proved a source of damage to the buildings because of vibration and pollution. There have been a number of proposals to remove the road, but none have taken effect. Forum of Caesar Forum of Caesar Julius Caesar decided to construct a large forum bearing his name. This forum was inaugurated in 46 BC, although it was probably incomplete at this time and was finished later by Augustus. The Forum of Caesar was constructed as an extension to the Roman Forum. The Forum was used as a replacement venue to the Roman Forum for public affairs as well as government; it was also designed as a celebration of Caesar's power. Caesar had placed, on the front of his forum, a temple devoted to Venus Genetrix, since Caesar's family (gens Julia) claimed to descend by Venus through Aeneas. A statue of Caesar himself riding Bucephalus, the celebrated horse of Alexander the Great, was placed in front of the temple, to symbolise absolute power. This centralised vision corresponded to the ideological function, following the propaganda of the Hellenistic sanctuaries; also the choice of the Forum site carried a meaning: the future dictator didn't want to be far from the central power, represented in the Curia, seat of the Senate. In fact, not long before Caesar's death, the Senate agreed to reconstruct the Curia on the site. Forum of Augustus Forum of Augustus with the 240x240px In the battle of Philippi in 42 BC, in which Augustus and Mark Antony worked together and avenged Caesar's death, defeating the forces of Brutus and Cassius, Augustus vowed to build the Temple of Mars Ultor (\\"Mars the Avenger\\"). The incomplete forum was inaugurated, after 40 years of construction, in 2 BC, adding the second monumental square, the Forum of Augustus. This new complex lies at right angles to the Forum of Caesar. The temple consists of a very tall wall, and this still distinguishes itself from the popular neighbourhood of Suburra. This high wall served as a firebreak, protecting the Forum area from the frequent conflagrations from which Rome suffered. The rectangular square has long deep porticos with a surface that widens into large semicircular exedras. Recently one more slightly smaller exedra was found south on the wall bordering the forum of Trajan. meaning that in sake of symmetry there must have been other exedra demolished to make room for the forum of Nerva, rising the number to 4 and not 2 exedras. This completely changes the layout for the south part of the forum of Augustus, meaning that it is much more similar to the forum of Trajan and a new theory for this southern part of the forum suggests that in fact there was a basilica between the 2 new exedras (like in the forum of Trajan). This supports the numerous ancient authors that tell us the forum was used as a court of law. The entire decoration of the Forum was tightly connected to the ideology of Augustus. According to myth, Rome herself was born from the god Mars through Romulus. This forum was occupied by many plebeians as well as senators. Temple of Peace 240x240px In 75 AD, the Temple of Peace, also known as the Forum of Vespasian, was built under Emperor Vespasian. Separated from the Forum of Augustus, the Forum of Caesar and the via dell' which connect the Roman Forum to the Subura, the temple faced the Velian Hill (in the direction of the Colosseum). The fact that this structure is not mentioned as having a civil function has prevented it from being classified as a true Forum. Therefore, the structure was simply identified as the Temple of Peace (Templum Pacis) until the late Empire. The shape of the square was also different: the temple was constructed as a large apsidal hall that opened up like an exedra at the bottom of the portico. A row of columns distinguished the portico from the temple. The central area was not paved like other fora and served as a garden, with pools and pedestals for statues, so that it was similar to an open-air museum. The monument was built to celebrate the conquest of Jerusalem. One of the chambers opened at the end of the porticos housed the Forma Urbis Romae, a marble map of ancient Rome, made in the Severan period (3rd century) by drawing on the marble slab that covered the wall. The wall is now part of the fa√ßade of the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano, where the holes used to mount the slabs of the map can still be seen. The Temple of Peace is also said to have housed the Menorah from Herod's Temple. Forum of Nerva, or the Transitional Forum The so-called \\"Colonnacce\\": remains of the peristyle which defined the Forum of Nerva Domitian decided to unify the previous complex and the free remaining irregular area, between the Temple of Peace and the Fora of Caesar and Augustus, and build another monumental forum which connected all of the other fora. The limited space, partially occupied by one of the exedrae of the Forum of Augustus and by the via dell'Argileto, obliged Domitian to build the lateral porticos as simply decorations of the bounding walls of the forum. The temple, dedicated to Minerva as protector of the emperor, was built leaning on the exedra of the Forum of Augustus, so that the remaining space became a large monumental entrance (Porticus Absidatus) for all the fora. Because of the death of Domitian, the forum was inaugurated by his successor, Nerva, who gave his own name to it. The Forum of Nerva is also known as Transitional Forum, because it worked as an access way, just like via dell'Argileto had done. Forum of Trajan Forum of Trajan It is probable that Domitian's projects were more ambitious than the building of the small \\"Forum of Nerva\\", and probably under his reign they started to remove the small saddle that united the Capitoline Hill to the Quirinal Hill, thus blocking the Fora towards Campus Martius, near to modern Piazza Venezia. The project was resumed by Trajan with the construction of Trajan's Forum between 112 and 113. The occasion was the conquest of Dacia, whose spoils paid for this celebration of the military conquests of Rome. The preparation of the Forum required a lot of work. It was necessary to remove the hilly saddle, and to support the cut of Quirinal Hill through the building of Trajan's market. The Forum square was closed by the Basilica Ulpia, with Trajan's Column at its back. In front of the basilica, a monumental fa√ßade was the background of a large, equestrian sculpture of the Emperor. The last Forum was also the biggest and greatest.Tucci, Pier Luigi, ‚ÄòNuove osservazioni sull‚Äôarchitettura del Templum Pacis‚Äô, in F. Coarelli (ed.), Divus Vespasianus.

The term Act of Parliament clock came about long after these clocks were already in existence. In 1797, a tax against clocks of five shillings was introduced in the Kingdom of Great Britain by the Prime Minister William Pitt. The tax was very unpopular among clockmakers and was repealed after nine months. The large clocks in inns were later popularly (though incorrectly) said to have been developed as a response to this tax.

They were invented by Michael Luby in 1998 and published in 2002.M.Luby, \\"LT Codes\\", The 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2002. Like some other fountain codes, LT codes depend on sparse bipartite graphs to trade reception overhead for encoding and decoding speed. The distinguishing characteristic of LT codes is in employing a particularly simple algorithm based on the exclusive or operation (\\\\oplus) to encode and decode the message.The exclusive or (XOR) operation, symbolized by ‚äï, has the very useful property that A ‚äï A = 0, where A is an arbitrary string of bits. LT codes are rateless because the encoding algorithm can in principle produce an infinite number of message packets (i.e., the percentage of packets that must be received to decode the message can be arbitrarily small). They are erasure correcting codes because they can be used to transmit digital data reliably on an erasure channel. The next generation beyond LT codes are Raptor codes (see for example IETF RFC 5053 or IETF RFC 6330), which have linear time encoding and decoding. Raptor codes use two encoding stages for encoding, where the second stage is an LT encoding. Information about availability of an efficient software implementation of the RaptorQ code specified in IETF RFC 6330 (the most advanced fountain code), can be found at the website for the Codornices project at ICSI . Why use an LT code? The traditional scheme for transferring data across an erasure channel depends on continuous two-way communication. *The sender encodes and sends a packet of information. *The receiver attempts to decode the received packet. If it can be decoded, the receiver sends an acknowledgment back to the transmitter. Otherwise, the receiver asks the transmitter to send the packet again. *This two-way process continues until all the packets in the message have been transferred successfully. Certain networks, such as ones used for cellular wireless broadcasting, do not have a feedback channel. Applications on these networks still require reliability. Fountain codes in general, and LT codes in particular, get around this problem by adopting an essentially one-way communication protocol. *The sender encodes and sends packet after packet of information. *The receiver evaluates each packet as it is received. If there is an error, the erroneous packet is discarded. Otherwise the packet is saved as a piece of the message. *Eventually the receiver has enough valid packets to reconstruct the entire message. When the entire message has been received successfully the receiver signals that transmission is complete. LT encoding The encoding process begins by dividing the uncoded message into n blocks of roughly equal length. Encoded packets are then produced with the help of a pseudorandom number generator. *The degree d, 1 ‚â§ d ‚â§ n, of the next packet is chosen at random. *Exactly d blocks from the message are randomly chosen. *If Mi is the ith block of the message, the data portion of the next packet is computed as :: M_{i_1} \\\\oplus M_{i_2} \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus M_{i_d}\\\\, :where {i1, i2, ‚Ä¶, id} are the randomly chosen indices for the d blocks included in this packet. *A prefix is appended to the encoded packet, defining how many blocks n are in the message, how many blocks d have been exclusive- ored into the data portion of this packet, and the list of indices {i1, i2, ‚Ä¶, id}. *Finally, some form of error-detecting code (perhaps as simple as a cyclic redundancy check) is applied to the packet, and the packet is transmitted. This process continues until the receiver signals that the message has been received and successfully decoded. LT decoding The decoding process uses the \\"exclusive or\\" operation to retrieve the encoded message. *If the current packet isn't clean, or if it replicates a packet that has already been processed, the current packet is discarded. *If the current cleanly received packet is of degree d > 1, it is first processed against all the fully decoded blocks in the message queuing area (as described more fully in the next step), then stored in a buffer area if its reduced degree is greater than 1. *When a new, clean packet of degree d = 1 (block Mi) is received (or the degree of the current packet is reduced to 1 by the preceding step), it is moved to the message queueing area, and then matched against all the packets of degree d > 1 residing in the buffer. It is exclusive-ored into the data portion of any buffered packet that was encoded using Mi, the degree of that matching packet is decremented, and the list of indices for that packet is adjusted to reflect the application of Mi. *When this process unlocks a block of degree d = 2 in the buffer, that block is reduced to degree 1 and is in its turn moved to the message queueing area, and then processed against the packets remaining in the buffer. *When all n blocks of the message have been moved to the message queueing area, the receiver signals the transmitter that the message has been successfully decoded. This decoding procedure works because A \\\\oplus A = 0 for any bit string A. After d ‚àí 1 distinct blocks have been exclusive-ored into a packet of degree d, the original unencoded content of the unmatched block is all that remains. In symbols we have : \\\\begin{align} & {} \\\\qquad (M_{i_1} \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus M_{i_d}) \\\\oplus (M_{i_1} \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus M_{i_{k-1}} \\\\oplus M_{i_{k+1}} \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus M_{i_d}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = M_{i_1} \\\\oplus M_{i_1} \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus M_{i_{k-1}} \\\\oplus M_{i_{k-1}} \\\\oplus M_{i_k} \\\\oplus M_{i_{k+1}} \\\\oplus M_{i_{k+1}} \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus M_{i_d} \\\\oplus M_{i_d} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = 0 \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus 0 \\\\oplus M_{i_k} \\\\oplus 0 \\\\oplus \\\\dots \\\\oplus 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = M_{i_k} \\\\, \\\\end{align} Variations Several variations of the encoding and decoding processes described above are possible. For instance, instead of prefixing each packet with a list of the actual message block indices {i1, i2, ‚Ä¶, id}, the encoder might simply send a short \\"key\\" which served as the seed for the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) or index table used to construct the list of indices. Since the receiver equipped with the same RNG or index table can reliably recreate the \\"random\\" list of indices from this seed, the decoding process can be completed successfully. Alternatively, by combining a simple LT code of low average degree with a robust error-correcting code, a raptor code can be constructed that will outperform an optimized LT code in practice.Fountain codes, by D.J.C. MacKay, first published in IEEE Proc.-Commun., Vol. 152, No. 6, December 2005. Optimization of LT codes There is only one parameter that can be used to optimize a straight LT code: the degree distribution function (described as a pseudorandom number generator for the degree d in the LT encoding section above). In practice the other \\"random\\" numbers (the list of indices { i1, i2, ‚Ä¶, id } ) are invariably taken from a uniform distribution on [0, n), where n is the number of blocks into which the message has been divided.Optimizing the Degree Distribution of LT Codes with an Importance Sampling Approach, by Esa Hyyti√§, Tuomas Tirronen, and Jorma Virtamo (2006). Luby himself discussed the \\"ideal soliton distribution\\" defined by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{P}\\\\\\\\{d=1\\\\\\\\}& = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[2pt] \\\\mathrm{P}\\\\\\\\{d=k\\\\\\\\}& = \\\\frac{1}{k(k-1)} \\\\qquad (k=2,3,\\\\dots,n). \\\\, \\\\end{align} This degree distribution theoretically minimizes the expected number of redundant code words that will be sent before the decoding process can be completed. However the ideal soliton distribution does not work well in practice because any fluctuation around the expected behavior makes it likely that at some step in the decoding process there will be no available packet of (reduced) degree 1 so decoding will fail. Furthermore, some of the original blocks will not be xor-ed into any of the transmission packets. Therefore, in practice, a modified distribution, the \\"robust soliton distribution\\", is substituted for the ideal distribution. The effect of the modification is, generally, to produce more packets of very small degree (around 1) and fewer packets of degree greater than 1, except for a spike of packets at a fairly large quantity chosen to ensure that all original blocks will be included in some packet.

(Press release of a 2001 art show at the Weisman Art Museum) Artists on the label included Le Tigre and The Butchies. OutSmart magazine noted that Mr. Lady was \\"queercore's strongest label.\\" The label was founded in 1996 in Durham, North Carolina by musician Kaia Wilson and artist/UNC photography professor Tammy Rae Carland, aiming to redress what they saw as a lack of feminist record labels at the time. As well as a range of recording artists, the label was also heavily involved in other events that promoted feminist thinking and music, such as the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival ‚Äì which led to some controversy in 1999 ‚Äì and various art showcases. Mr. Lady closed down in June 2004. Founding Kaia Wilson was a member of lesbian punk group The Butchies, and felt their \\"out politics held them back.\\" Without a record company to specifically represent the work of herself and other \\"out\\" female musicians, Wilson and her girlfriend, Tammy Rae Carland, found their opportunities limited. Subsequently, they formed Mr. Lady to redress the \\"lack of enough women and/or dyke run record labels,\\" which they felt led to an \\"extremely limited amount of affordable and accessible means for independent artists to distribute their work.\\" Thus, Mr. Lady Records was started with, in Wilson's words, \\"$35 and a lotta...faith.\\" Wilson stated the name \\"Mr. Lady\\" came from a trip to Italy while on tour with Team Dresch: \\"I saw a store called Mr. Baby, and it freaked me out. Then everyone started calling me Mr. Baby. Then I became Mr. Baby onstage. I had my own theme song and everything. I wore a little eyeliner mustache. From there it changed into Mr. Lady, which just seemed like a good name for a queer label.\\" It also related to Ladyman, Wilson's first solo LP, produced with the aid of Melissa York after they both left lesbian \\"supergroup\\" Team Dresch. Artists and releases Mr. Lady Records released recordings by groups such as Kathleen Hanna's lo-fi group Le Tigre (who released their first two records ‚Äì Le Tigre and Feminist Sweepstakes ‚Äì with Mr. Lady), punk group The Butchies (of whom Kaia Wilson is the lead singer), British group Electrelane, Tara Jane O'Neil, spoken-word collective Sister Spit (Sini Anderson and Michelle Tea), and others. In March 2001, Calling All Kings & Queens, a sampler album, was released which featured eighteen tracks from various artists and friends of the label, including Sleater-Kinney and Team Dresch. It followed 1999's New Women's Music Sampler. A focus on women musicians No band that signed with Mr. Lady contained a male artist. Carland said \\"It's not that we're necessarily never going to put out a band with men in it, but it's just kind of organically happened that way. We wanted to focus on putting out music by women. We do consider ourselves a feminist business and part of that involves prioritizing work made by women.\\" Due to their work with Mr. Lady, Wilson and Carland were described as two of the \\"100 most influential gay people in the world\\" by About.com in 2002. Growing popularity Although initially a vehicle for Wilson to release her own albums, Mr. Lady grew into a label whose musical and political contributions gained national attention. During a review of Tami Hart's debut release with Mr. Lady, online magazine PopMatters described the label as \\"one of the bright spots in new music. Whether the groups or singers are punk or indie, they are all anti-mainstream hip, political, and good ‚Äì really good.\\" Discorder magazine described the label in 2004 as \\"lead[ing] the way when it came to releasing music that was as politically significant as it was danceable.\\" Initially distributing music through mail order, the label signed a deal to distribute records nationally across the US in 2001. The Independent Weekly described the label as having \\"grown from a community that perhaps needed it the most,\\" contrasting the scarcity of a gay/lesbian-oriented label in the southern United States at the time with the many in New York. Involvement with the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Mr Lady logo used for the Mr. Sister event In 1999, Mr. Lady records (along with one of its artists, The Butchies), were involved in issues surrounding the debate as to whether transsexual women should be entitled to attend the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, which had a formal stance against allowing transsexual and transgender women to attend the festival. In response to a request from transgender activists to boycott the festival, Mr. Lady released a statement which defended the festival, believing that they did not consider an event for \\"womyn born womyn\\" and the transgender community to be mutually exclusive, but backed the right of the festival to exclude those not born as women. Kaia Wilson confirmed this in a June 1999 statement: \\"[W]e strongly believe that transgender/transsexual people are an important part of the queer community and that they face an enormous amount of opposition. [...] We know that the MWMF started as a separatist event for womyn born womyn and we personally still feel the continued need for that kind of space and event. [...] We don't think that our support of the trans communities and womyn born womyn communities are in direct contradiction to each other.\\" Formally backing the festival's trans-exclusion policy led to protests and boycotts aimed towards Mr. Lady acts, Wilson and The Butchies in particular. Groups such as Camp Trans, and many participants in the queercore community disagreed with Mr. Lady's stance and felt that the group and label exploited transgender images. The label went defunct in June 2004. Showcases Mr. Lady Records has sponsored numerous showcases of feminist and lesbian music, including events at the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus in Minneapolis, Minnesota (working with the Queer Student Cultural Center) and \\"Mr. Sister\\", a showcase at the National Queer Arts Festival in 2003 at the Center for Lesbian Gay Bi Transgender Art & Culture in San Francisco.

Born in Komi≈æa on the island of Vis (then a part of Austria- Hungary), Marinkoviƒá's childhood was marked by World War I. He later earned a degree in philosophy from the University of Zagreb. In the 1930s, he began to make his name in Zagreb literary circles with his plays and stories. His career was interrupted briefly during World War II. When his native island was occupied by fascist Italy, he was arrested in Split and interned in the Ferramonti camp. After the capitulation of Italy, Marinkoviƒá went to Bari, and then to the El Shatt refugee camp where he made contacts with Tito's Partisans. After the war, he spent time working in the theatre. His best known works are Glorija (1955), a play in which he criticised the Catholic Church, and Kiklop (1965), a semi-autobiographical novel in which he described the gloomy atmosphere among Zagreb intellectuals before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. Kiklop later was adapted into a 1982 movie directed by Antun Vrdoljak. In a 2010 Jutarnji list poll conducted among 41 Croatian scholars, writers, and public figures, Kiklop was chosen as the all-time best Croatian novel. In the last years of his life Marinkoviƒá embraced the political views of Franjo Tuƒëman, and became a member of the Croatian Democratic Union. He died in Zagreb.

There is no known historical evidence regarding either his birthplace or date, nor any known reference to it in his works. Some wrongly believe that he disappeared in 1768. Yet his Aisvarya-kadambini is dated 1779 (year 1701 of Shaka era). The original manuscript is preserved at the City Palace in Jaipur. While his birth date is unknown, a document preserved at the Jaipur Archives dated the fourteenth day of the Bhadra month of Sa·πÅvat 1850 (nineteenth of September, 1793 AD) describes his ceremony of condolence presided by King Pratap Singh of Jaipur (ruled 1778-1803 AD). On the basis of this evidence, it is unrealistic to assume that he was born much before 1700 AD. The earliest documents that mention Vidyabhusana belong to the 1740s. According to oral tradition, he was born in Odisha (possibly near Remuna, Balasore). Yet it is not clear when and how this oral tradition started. The first mention to it in written form was not earlier than late 19th century. Also according to oral tradition, at an early age he received a thorough education in grammar, poetry, rhetoric and logic. After concluding his studies, he went on a pilgrimage to various place in India. According to Vidyabhusana's statement at the end of his Siddhanta-ratna, he had been previously initiated in the Madhva-sampradaya before becoming a follower of the philosophy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When he visited Jagannatha Puri (Odisha), he met Sri Radha-Damodara Deva, a grand-disciple of Sri Rasikananda Deva, with whom he discussed philosophy. Sri Radha-Damodara Deva explained the conclusions of Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology as expounded by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Moved by those teachings, Baladeva was initiated and began to study the Sat-sandarbhas of Sri Jiva Gosvami. In a short time he became experienced in Gaudiya Vaisnava philosophy. With his guru's permission and blessings, he moved to Sri Vrindavana (Vrindavan) to study these teachings under Sri Visvanatha Chakravarti Thakura. Baladeva fully accepted the Gaudiya Vaisnava philosophy and became a powerful exponent of this system. His first known work was a commentary on the Vedanta-sutra or Brahma-sutra, entitled Brahma-sutra-karika-bhasya. It was composed by Vidyabhusana under the order of King Sawai Jai Singh II (1688-1743 AD), as mentioned at the beginning and the end of the manuscript. The work is not dated, but from the available historical documentation, it can be inferred that it was written between 1730 and 1740 AD. This was the Vedanta commentary that Vidyabhusana wrote very quickly in order to appease the King and the opponents who belittled the Gaudiyas for not having a Brahma-sutra-bhasya. The much more famous Govinda- bhasya was a much later and more elaborate work, and its oldest known manuscript is dated Sa·πÅvat 1815 (1758 AD). Some claim that Baladeva received the title \\"Vidyabhusana\\" from the King or from the Ramanandis. However, the Karika-bhasya manuscript and his other earlier manuscripts are signed \\"Vidyabhusana.\\" He may have received this title before joining the Gaudiyas, probably when he was a Tattvavadi debater. Another of his earlier works was the Tattva-dipika, also written under the order of Sawai Jai Singh II. Some misinformed individuals also claim that the Govinda-bhasya was written at Galta, to which there is not the slightest evidence and which makes no sense at all, as according to documentary evidence, even during Sawai Jai Singh II Vidyabhusana was the Mahant of the New Govinda-deva Temple in Vrindavan as well as of his own temple in Jaipur, and the idea that he left his duties in both places to sit down in a temple of another sampradaya to write a commentary is nothing but absurd. The earliest documents that mention Baladeva Vidyabhusana belong to the 1740s, therefore it is most unlikely that he had any participation in the Amer/Jaipur debates before the 1730s. Other works include Siddhanta-ratnam (Govinda-bhasya- pithakam),https://www.amazon.com/Siddhanta-ratnam-Introduction-Govinda-bhasya- Baladeva-Vidyabhusana- ebook/dp/B07SSF5L1L/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ratnam&qid;=1569167113&sr;=8-3 Prameya-ratnavali, Siddhanta-darpana, Kavya-kaustubha, Vyakarana-kaumudi, Pada-kaustubha, Isadi-upanisad bhasya, Gitabhusana-bhasya, Sri Visnunama- sahasra-nama-bhasya, Sanksepa-bhagavatamrta- tippani, Tattva-sandarbha-tika, Stava-mala-vibhusana-bhasya, Nataka-candrika-tika, Candraloka-tika, Sahitya- kaumudi, Srimad-Bhagavata-tika (Vaisnavanandini). Commentary on Vedanta An important story attached to Sri Baladeva concerns his writing of the Vedanta commentary, his first known work. The Vaishnava sect known as Ramanandi sect allegedly complained that because the Gaudiya Vaisnavas had no commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, they were not qualified to worship the Deity and therefore the worship should be turned over to them. They also objected to the worship of Srimati Radharani along with Sri Krishna because they were not authorized anywhere in the shastras. The Ramanandis informed King Sawai Jai Singh II at Jaipur, Rajasthan who sent word to Vrindavana informing the devotees what had happened. At that time Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti was very aged so in his place, he sent his student, Sri Baladeva. Despite his strong arguments, the scholars in the assembly refused to accept anything other than a direct commentary on the sutra. Having no other recourse, Baladeva promised to present them with one. Sri Baladeva sought solace at Sri Govindaji's mandira (temple) in Jaipur. Feeling aggrieved, he informed Sri Govinda of everything that had happened. Legend has it that the Lord came to Sri Baladeva that night in a dream and told him to write the Vedanta sutra. Invigorated, Sri Baladeva began to write, and quickly completed the task. Impressed with the commentary, the Ramanandis expressed their desire to accept initiation from Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana. However, he declined their request by stating that among the four authorized sampradayas, the Sri sampradaya was highly respectable and the foremost adherent of Dasya-bhakti (devotion in servitorship). In Vrindavan Returning from Jaipur to Vrindavana, Sri Baladeva presented the certificate of victory to Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura and narrated the events that had transpired. Cakravartipada bestowed his full blessings on Sri Baladeva. At this time, Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana began to write a commentary on Srila Jiva Gosvami's Sat-sandarbha. Sri Vijaya Govinda, residing at Gokulananda Mandira in Vrindavana, is said to have been worshiped by Baladeva Vidyabhushana personally. According to the opinion of some devotees, Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana installed the large Deities Sri Radha-Syamasundara. After the departure of Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana became the next acharya of the Gaudiya Vaisnava sampradaya. He had two well-known disciples, Sri Uddhava dasa and Sri Nanda Misra. His samadhi is located on the back side of Sri-Sri-Radha-Shyamsundar Temple, Sevakunj, Vrindavan.

He introduced some modern teaching methods in Iran, especially in teaching the alphabet. These are still used to some degree in Iran's primary schools. A Photograph of Hassan Roshdieh Hassan Roshdieh was an ethnic Iranian Azerbaijani and began studying as a Twelver Shi'a cleric there, Roshdieh abandoned his plans of going to Najaf to study in religious schools after reading an article about the hardships of education in the Persian language from the newspaper Akhtar. He left for Beirut in 1880 and studied for two years in its Daar ul-Mu'allimeen (teacher school), and then continued with visiting Istanbul and Egypt. In 1883, he left for Yerevan and founded the first modern school for Muslims there. In his new method of teaching, Roshdieh used the concept of sounds instead of alphabetic letters to teach the Persian and Azeri languages, which use the Arabic script. During his four years of managing his school in Yerevan, Roshdieh wrote Vatan Dili (The Language of the Homeland) in Azerbaijani, which was taught in several schools of the Caucasus as a primer until the October Revolution. It was during his stay in Yerevan that Roshdieh met Nasser-al-Din Shah, who took him to Nakhichevan. Roshdieh later return to his birthplace in Tabriz, where he established the first primary schools in Iran in 1886 or 1887. While Ahmad Kasravi has claimed in his book that the primary school were established with the help of Ali Khan Amin od-Dowle, the then Premier of Iran, this cannot be confirmed by the records of Fakhreddin Roshdieh, Mirza Hassan's son. The schools were highly rejected by the more conservative Tabrizis, specially clerics, alleging that Roshdieh is trying to make the students quit Islam, mentioning the school ring and its similarity to church bells. This resulted in mobs destroying some of his schools (which resulted in a few students being killed or injured), unsuccessful assassination attempts using guns, and later a fatwa against the modern schools, which finally resulted in him fleeing Tabriz. An Image of Hassan Roshdieh with his students. In Tehran, and during the reign of Mozzafar-al-Din Shah and the prime ministership of Amin od-Dowle, Roshdieh started the Roshdieh School with the help of the government. He was a member of the political Ma'ƒÅref Association and active for the fight for freedoms and constitution during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, leading to him being exiled or fleeing Iran a few times. After a final return to Iran, Roshdieh established a new school and a magazine in 1904, both called Maktab. He finally quit his political and educational activities in 1927 and moved to Qom, where he died in 1944 and is buried. Roshdieh is claimed to be the first Azerbaijani to write poems for children. He also had plans for education of the blind people and had helped establishing girl schools in Iran. He has several books and articles in Persian and Azerbaijani. He was called Roshdieh after the name of primary schools in the then Ottoman empire, roshdiyye, because he had established the first such schools in Iran.

It was written in the year 1628 Sakabda (1718 CE) at Galtaji (Galta) near the present city of Jaipur, Rajasthan, by Baladeva Vidyabhushana to defend Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology. Govinda Bhashya: Gaudiya Vaishnava commentary on Vedanta Around this time (1718 CE), a branch of the Sri (Ramanuja) Sampradaya known as the Ramanandi sect, in the court of the king Sadacari Raja at Jaipur, Rajasthan, complained that since the Gaudiya Vaisnavas had no commentary on the Vedanta Sutra, they were not qualified to worship the Deity and therefore the worship should be turned over to the Sri Sampradaya. They also objected to the worship of Srimati Radharani along with Sri Krishna as not being authorised anywhere in the shastras. The king was initiated within the Gaudiya sampradaya and he sent word to Vrindavana, informing the devotees what had happened. At that time Srila Visvanatha Chakravarti was very aged so in his place he sent his student, Sri Baladeva. In a great assembly he posed such forceful arguments to the followers of Ramanuja that they could not reply to them. He further explained: \\"The originator of the Gaudiya Vaisnava sampradaya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, has accepted Srimad Bhagavatam as the natural commentary on the Vedanta-sutra, as composed by Srila Vyasadeva Himself. This is proven in the Sat-sandarbhas.\\" The scholars in the assembly, however, refused to accept anything other than a direct commentary on the sutra. Having no other recourse, Baladeva promised to present them with one. Feeling very aggrieved, Sri Baladeva came to Sri Govindaji's mandira (temple) and informed Sri Govinda of everything that had happened. That night the Lord appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to write a commentary on the Vedanta-sutra: \\"I will dictate to you what to write and therefore no one will be able to refuse to accept it.\\" Thus Baladeva began to write, and within a few days completed the commentary which was titled 'Sri Govinda Bhashya'. It convinced the Ramanandi scholars and they bestowed upon Sri Baladeva the title 'Vidyabhushana' ('ornament of knowledge (vidya)'). They expressed their desire to accept initiation from Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana. However, he declined their request by stating that amongst the four authorized sampradayas, the Sri sampradaya was highly respectable and the foremost adherent of dasya-bhakti (devotion in servitorship). If there was any cause of loss of respect to the sampradaya this might be considered an offense. An English translation of this text was presented by Rai Bahadur Srisa Chandra Vasu in 1916.

It had in 2013 a population of 14,334 inhabitants. Geography of Gaillac Gaillac is a town situated between Toulouse, Albi and Montauban. It has gained much recognition due to the wines that bear the town's name. The Tarn river runs along the border of the town by the south, east and west. It lies 50 km north- east of Toulouse. It is a market town and is the commercial centre of the north-west of Tarn. The local wine of Gaillac, first made almost two thousand years ago, is of two official appellations (AOC). The terroir is made up of clay, limestone, sand and silex soils. Gaillac receives more sunshine than Bordeaux and is graced by a cool maritime climate. Duras is the name both of the grape that is native to this area and of an AOC and town just northwest of the two \\"Gaillac\\" designations. History of Gaillac The town was founded in the second century CE by the Gauls who created a river port where they exported their wine into Gallia Narbonensis. When Aquitania was conquered by Rome, Gaillac gained prosperity with its wine. However, the barbarian invasions annihilated the town and left nothing behind. It was only when the monks of Saint-Michel gained viticulture privileges from the Bishop of Albi, in 972, that the population stabilized and Gaillac started to become a town again. Their wines were at first sent to Bordeaux where they would be exported to England. The Abbey of St. Michel was constructed in the 10th century and rebuilt in 1271. In 1524 the abbey was secularized but the title of abbey retained. During the religious wars, the \\"Gaillacois\\" refused to change their religion and remained Catholics and were chased out of the town by Protestants. They took refuge at Castelnau-de-Montmiral. After the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre on 24 August 1572, in Paris, the Gaillacois massacred 74 out of the 90 Huguenots in the town. The abbey was once again rebuilt between 1572-1620. In the seventeenth century the Chateau of Foucaud was erected. It was from the town of Gaillac that Louis-Philippe I addressed the words: > Nous chercherons √† nous tenir dans un juste milieu, √©galement √©loign√© des > exc√®s du pouvoir populaire et des abus du pouvoir royal. Which may be translated: \\"We seek to keep ourselves in proper state, aloof from both the excesses of popular power and the abuses of royal power.\\" This sentence would define the July Monarchy.

His death was allegedly caused by spontaneous human combustion. Discovery of Bentley's remains Bentley was last seen alive 4 December 1966, when friends visiting his home wished him good night at about 9 p.m. The following morning, meter reader Don Gosnell let himself into Bentley's house, as he had permission to do due to Bentley's infirmity, and went to the basement to check the meter. While in the basement, Gosnell noticed a strange smell and a light blue smoke. He explained the smoke to be \\"somewhat sweet, like starting up a new oil-burning central heating system\\". On the ground was a neat pile of ash, about 35 centimetres in height. The floor underneath the ash was unmarked. Had he looked up, he would've seen a hole about a foot long square in the floor boards above. Intrigued, he went upstairs to investigate. The bedroom was smoky and in the bathroom he found Bentley's cremated remains. All that was left of the aged doctor was the lower half of his right leg with the slipper still on it. The rest of his body had been reduced to a pile of ashes in the basement below. His walker lay across the hole in the floor generated by the fire. The rubber tips on it were still intact and the nearby bathtub was barely scorched. Gosnell ran from the building to get help. He reached the gas company office screaming \\"Doctor Bentley's burned up!\\" to his colleagues. Later on, his colleagues said: \\"he looked as white as a sheet\\".  Theories  The first theory put forward was that Bentley had set himself on fire with his pipe, but his pipe was still on its stand by the bed in the next room. Perplexed, the coroner could only record a verdict of 'death by asphyxiation and 90 percent burning of the body.' Joe Nickell, in his book Secrets of the Supernatural, gives an account of this event he got from Larry E. Arnold's article \\"The Flaming Fate of Dr. John Irving Bentley,\\" printed in the Pursuit of Fall 1976. Nickell mentions that the hole in the bathroom floor measured 2¬Ω feet by 4 feet, and details the remains as being Bentley's lower leg burned off at the knee. Nickell mentions that Bentley's robe was found smoldering in the bathtub next to the hole, and that the broken remains of \\"what was apparently a water pitcher\\" were found in the toilet; he adds that the doctor had dropped hot ashes from his pipe onto his clothing previously (which \\"were dotted with burn spots from previous incidents\\"), and that he kept wooden matches in his pockets which could transform a small ember into a blazing flame. Nickell believes that Bentley woke up to find his clothes on fire, walked to the bathroom, and passed out before he could extinguish the flames. Then, he suggests that the burning clothes ignited the flammable linoleum floor, and cool air drawn from the basement in what is known as \\"the stack effect\\" kept the fire burning hotly.

Soon after the beginning of war, the four Aaronsohn siblings (Sarah Aaronsohn, Rivka, Alex, and Aaron) founded the Nili underground along with Feinberg. They were later joined by Yosef Lishansky and others. In 1915 Feinberg traveled to Egypt and made contact with British Naval Intelligence. In 1917, Feinberg again journeyed to Egypt, on foot. He was apparently killed on his way back by a group of Bedouins near the British front in Sinai, close to Rafah. His fate was unknown until after the 1967 Six-Day War when his remains were found under a palm tree that had grown from date seeds in his pocket to mark the spot where he lay.

The character first appeared in 1860 at the Strand Theatre, London in a version of the story derived from the opera La Cenerentola by Rossini. Rossini includes a character Dandini as assistant to the Prince, which was also included, and a complementary character for Cinderella, called Buttoni was added for the pantomime at this time.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality was part of the province of Shariff Kabunsuan from October 2006 until its nullification by the Supreme Court in July 2008. Etymology Upi was probably derived from the term \\"ufi\\". It is a Teduray name for a certain tree (piper betel) that grows abundantly in the place in the early years. The bark of ‚ÄúUfi‚Äù is used with betel nuts for chewing or \\"mama\\" in Teduray. Tedurays are the native inhabitants of the place. History The beginning of Upi as a district geographical and political entity largely began on the early part of 1901 to 1910 when the American forces set foot in the then Province of Cotabato. An American Army Officer Captain Irving Bryant Edwards was assigned in Awang. He showed great interest in bringing the government closer to the people by establishing schools in the far-flung areas. He reached the fertile valley of Upi and founded the Upi Agricultural School on August 19, 1919. From a USAFFE soldier, Capt. Irving Bryant Edwards turned educator. Upi was formerly a barrio of Dinaig. It was separated from the said town by virtue of Republic Act No. 1248, approved June 10, 1955. The first Municipal Mayor, Vice Mayor and Councilors of Upi were appointed by the President of the Philippines to hold office. Maria Badoy was appointed as the first Municipal Mayor. In 1956, the citizens were encouraged to participate in the political affairs of the local government and there took place the first election wherein Mayor Ignacio Tenorio Labina, a Teduray leader, was the first elected mayor of Upi and held his office for four years. In 2006, Upi lost about when the coastal barangays Kinimi, Laguitan, Lapaken, Matuber, Meti, Nalkan, Penansaran, Sedem, Sinipak, Resa, Tambak and Tubuan in the Municipality of Upi were separated to create the new municipality of Datu Blah T.

The dedicants were usually private individuals and were exclusively male. During the 3rd Century AD the cult was particularly popular among the ranks of the Roman army. Veteris' name was never linked with that of any of the Classical gods, but he was invoked with another local god, Mogons, at Netherby. Centres of worship Veteris was worshipped in Roman Britain and altar-stones raised to him have been recovered in the United Kingdom,The Gods of Roman Britain from roman-britain.org such as those excavated at: *Netherby (971 [Mogont Vitire], 973 [Huetiri]) *Carrawburgh (1548 [Veteri], 1549 [Huiteribus]) *Housesteads (1602 [Hueteri], 1603 [Huitri], 1604-7 [Veteribus]) *Hadrian's Wall (2068 [Veteri], 2096 [Huiteribus]) *Catterick (727) *Chester-le-Street (1046 [Vitiri], 1047 [Vitiribus], 1048 [Vitbus]) *South Shields (1070c [Ansu Vitiri]) *Lanchester (1087, 1088) *Ebchester (1103 & 1104 [Vitiri]) *Corbridge (1139 [Veteri], 1140 [Vitiri], 1141 [Vit]) *Benwell (1335 [Vetri], 1336 [Vitirbus]) *Chesters (1455 [Vitiri], 1456 [Veteribus], 1457 [Vitirbus], 1458 [Votris?]) *Great Chesters (1728 [Vetiri], 1729 & 1730 [Veteribus]) *Chesterholm (1697 [Veteri], 1698 [Veteri], 1699 [Veteribus], 1722e & 1722f [Veteribus]) *Carvoran (1793-5 [Veteri], 1796 [Vetiri], 1797 [Vetiriu], 1798 [Viterino], 1799-1801 [Vitiri], 1802/3 [Veteribus], 1804 [Viteribus], 1805 [Vitiribus]) Forty altars to this god are recorded altogether, some alluding to Veteris as a single entity, others to a multiple version, perhaps a triad. Little is known about the specific function or character of the god. Occasionally, there is iconography associated with Veteris: for example, an altar from Carvoran is decorated with images of a boar and snake, the boar indicative of hunting or war and the snake healing or death.

The newly created municipality has eighteen (18) barangays taken from its mother Municipality of Shariff Aguak. On July 30, 2009, upon the ratification of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 225 (as amended by MMAA 252), the municipality of Shariff Saydona Mustapha was created from 4 barangays and a portion of one barangay (Libutan East) from Mamasapano, in addition to other barangays from Datu Piang, Datu Unsay, Datu Saudi-Ampatuan and Shariff Aguak. =Mamasapano clash= On Sunday 25 January 2015, the area around Mamasapano was the site of a sharp clash between Philippines government armed forces and local rebel groups. In the fighting, 44 members of the Philippine National Police elite Special Action Force (SAF) were killed. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) led by Necesio Jamisola Jr., later reported that 18 people had died on the rebel side. Some local civilians were also killed during the incident. The unexpected clash, and the deaths of 44 SAF police as well as the wounding of 12 others, triggered bitter recriminations amongst leaders at the national level and threatened to derail on-going reconciliation negotiations between the Philippines Government and various rebel groups in Mindanao. It was reported that members of both the MILF as well as the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) were involved in the action on the rebel side.Louis Bacani, 'Aquino admits knowing SAF operation in Mamasapano', The Philippine Star, updated 28 January 2014. In response to the clash and deaths of national police, President Aquino called for the peace talks with MILF to nevertheless continue but also demanded that MILF forces assist in identifying the persons responsible for killing the police and, in other ways, demonstrate sincerity in supporting the peace efforts.Louis Bacani, 'Aquino: Let's not abandon peace talks with MILF', The Philippines Star updated 28 January 2015. Subsequently, it was reported that both the Philippines government and local MILF representatives were working to try to restore life to normal in the Mamasapano area. Representatives of the Philippines government visited the area in early February to deliver assistance to families who had lost relatives during the fighting. Representatives of the MILF also issued assurances that on-going efforts to establish peace in the region would not be disrupted by the clash.John Unson, 'Life back to normal in Mamasapano', The Philippines Star, 6 February 2015.

It consisted of a Junior Department, providing education for pupils up to age 11. In 2010, St Ursula's went into administration after it became financially unviable due to falling pupil numbers. It was temporarily saved by the Bristol City Council, which bought the school site, and Community Learning, a subsidiary of the Oasis Trust. This led to the opening of School Westbury' as an interim measure during the 2010/2011 academic year. Oasis Community Learning operated the school with a one-year lease and closed it in July 2011. At the start of the 2011/2012 academic year, Bristol Council allocated the site to St Ursula's E-ACT Academy, the first primary academy in Bristol. In January 2015, St Ursula's was given a good rating by Ofsted which remains sponsored by E-ACT History The school was named after St. Ursula, the patron saint of young girls and students. It was opened in 1896 by the Sisters of Mercy, St. Ursula's was originally a girls' boarding school. The school stopped accepting boarders in 1927. During the Second World War, the cellars served as air raid shelters to the population of Henleaze and in 1942 the school was bombed and evacuated. Much of the school was destroyed by the bombing, but was re-built in 1948. In 1972 the school underwent major changes when the convent was converted into classrooms and subject rooms. Also in 1972, the Board of Governors took responsibility for the strategic management and policies operated by the school, including its financial affairs and facilities. In 1986, the Gym/Sports Hall for Games Lessons and the community was opened, after contributions from parents. The school retained close links with the Sacred Heart Catholic Church positioned at the rear of the school but lessons were not taught by the nuns after 1988, when the Sisters of Mercy withdrew from independent education in the UK and the school was taken over by an educational trust. The first lay headmistress was Margaret McNaughton who served until 2005. Under her leadership the school began to accept boys, first in the Junior School and then in the Senior Department in 1996. At this time the Sixth Form was closed due to inadequate numbers. In 2005, Lynette Carter, who previously had served as Senior Mistress of the Junior Department, took over as Headmistress. She continued as headteacher when the school became Oasis Westbury. =Closure= Facing falling pupil numbers, in early 2010 St. Ursula's expressed interest in moving to the state sector as an Academy.Academy hopes for Bristol private school, BBC News, 16 February 2010 This did not come to fruition, and as the Trustees were unable to find a purchaser who could take the school on as a going concern, Grant Thornton were appointed as administrators. In August 2010 they announced that the school would close.Grant Thornton administrators called in at St Ursula's High School Trust, Accountancy Age, 3 August 2010 Oasis Community Learning took it over with a one-year lease from the council and said that they wanted to run an all-through academy on the site or at least a primary academy. However the bids failed and education provider E-ACT were chosen to run a primary only academy on the site. Oasis School Westbury closed on 15 July 2011. =Efforts to save the school from closure= On the creation of Oasis School Westbury, parents of St. Ursula's pupils formed the Parents' Action Group (PAG). This group tried to save the school, first by supporting Oasis and then by putting in their own free school application bid. When rejection of the PAG/Oasis bids was announced, some parents formed a new group, Bristol Children First. This group aimed to save their school by negotiating with the Bristol Free School (BFS) Trust, which comprised a local parents' group called Parents' Voice and the Russell Education Trust. The BFS Trust wanted to run their own secondary free school on the St. Ursula's site. They were originally in competition with both Oasis and PAG, but were progressing faster towards Department for Education approval. They applied to the DfE to alter the business case for their proposal to extend it from Secondary to all-through provision, but were not successful in doing so. BFS was eventually approved to open as a Secondary school, and was allocated an alternative temporary site in Brentry. The BFS Trust hoped to move the school to the St. Ursula's site in 2012, but its bid to do that was unsuccessful. BFS opened in September 2011 with Year 7 only, so was unable to accommodate pupils from St. Ursula's who were entering Year 8 or above. Primary pupils from the original St. Ursula's school were accommodated at St Ursula's E-ACT Academy, which also opened in September 2011, and therefore were able to remain at the original St. Ursula's site. PAG submitted another secondary free school bid in 2013 to cater for senior pupils at the St. Ursula's site. In the meantime the St. Ursula's E-ACT Academy said it would consider expanding to provide Secondary places if there was enough parental demand. Badge and motto The school's badge and motto was known as the Mercy Shield or Misericordia Shield and is the insignia of the Order of the Sisters of Mercy. It has been a symbol of mercy since the thirteenth century. The motto 'Dominus Illuminatio Mea' is Latin for 'The Lord is my Light'. The Saint Ursula's Serviam badge is a field of seven stars representing The Little Bear Constellation, known as Ursa Minor. Building and site The main building is large with a clock tower. It is a Grade II listed building. There was a sports hall and large playing fields, a forest area and a small garden behind in an estate covering a total of . There were a number of \\"quads\\" around the school, some with religious statues and gardens. On the top floor of the school (with the little single square windows) were the old rooms where the boarders used to sleep. They also used to sleep in rooms along the corridor which later housed the kitchen, offices and the senior department library. At the front of the school, next to the main gate, there is a graveyard for the nuns of the Sisters of Mercy.

Ramos was in New York, New York, when the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred; Trinidad was scheduled to fight Bernard Hopkins at the Madison Square Garden on September 15 of that year. The fight took place on September 29 instead, and Trinidad lost by a twelfth-round knockout. Trinidad retired after one more fight, a win over Hacine Cherifi. F√©lix Trinidad Sr. also retired as a manager following his son's retirement. As a consequence, he decided to distribute his other boxers between his close associates, including Ramos. Among the boxers that Ramos received was Fres Oquendo, a Heavyweight contender at the time. Ramos received Oquendo after Oquendo had lost by a ninth-round knockout to David Tua. He received one dollar and an economical remuneration for a lawsuit that he established against F√©lix Trinidad Sr. in Chicago, Illinois. The lawsuit is still to be decided. Ramos helped Oquendo get title shots against Chris Byrd, who beat Oquendo by a twelve-round decision for the IBF world Heavyweight title, and against John Ruiz, who knocked Oquendo out in the eleventh round for the WBA world Heavyweight title, the latter fight being also being held at the Madison Square Garden and becoming the first time two Latin Americans and two Puerto Ricans fought for a world Heavyweight championship. Oquendo later wanted to terminate his contract with Ramos, which caused for a verbal fight to break out between the two in different Puerto Rican media, including newspapers. Ramos is still the on contract manager of Oquendo, and he returned with F√©lix Trinidad Jr. for his fights against Ricardo Mayorga and Ronald Wright. Trinidad Jr.'s financial problems Ramos purchased about $63,000,000 dollars in bonds for the Trinidads during Felix Jr.'s career. These were bought as an investment, but when Puerto Rico hit a financial crisis during the mid-2010s, their value dropped as Puerto Rican bonds ratings were reduced to junk status, causing the Trinidads to lose the money invested by Ramos.http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/sports/2014/04/16/down-but-not-out- boxing-legend-felix-trinidad-broke-because-puerto-rican/ See also * List of Puerto Ricans References External links *wbaonline.com, in Spanish Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Puerto Rican boxing managers Category:Puerto Rican businesspeople Category:Sportspeople from Ponce, Puerto Rico ","title":"Jose Ramos (boxing manager)"},{"id":"2172988","text":"The Bezirk Schwaz is an administrative district (Bezirk) in Tyrol, Austria.

He wrote to King George VI and asked permission to film the Royal stables. This resulted in a documentary, All the King's Horses which made a profit of ¬£5,000. He used this to make a series of documentaries, including All the King's Men and All the King's Music, making a profit of ¬£30,000. He moved into features with Murder at the Windmill (1949). In 1960, Angel, along with John Woolf became one of the first film producers to sell his work to television. This enraged the industry and for several years his films were boycotted by distributors and cinemas.Danny Angel: [1F Edition] The Times; London (UK) [London (UK)]17 Dec 1999: 27.

The novel encompasses a broad range of topics, from aliens and redheads to consumerism, the building of bombs, romance, royalty, the Moon, and a pack of Camel cigarettes. The novel continuously addresses the question of \\"how to make love stay\\" and is sometimes referred to as \\"a post-modern fairy tale\\". Plot Princess Leigh-Cheri, a redheaded vegetarian liberal princess and former cheerleader, lives with her exiled royal parents Max and Tilli and their last loyal servant Gulietta in a converted farmhouse in Seattle. While attending a liberal CareFest in Hawaii with scientific and political speakers (including Leigh-Cheri's idol, Ralph Nader) Leigh-Cheri meets Bernard Mickey Wrangle, an outlaw bomber known as the Woodpecker. Like Leigh-Cheri, he is a redhead, and unlike her, he plans to blow up the CareFest. At the Care Fest, Leigh-Cheri is approached by a beautiful blonde who claims she is from the planet Argon. She informs Leigh-Cheri that redheads are considered evil on her planet and that red hair is caused by \\"sugar and lust.\\" As it turns out, the Woodpecker has a passion for tequila that inadvertently causes him to bomb a UFO conference instead of his intended target. After the UFO conference is destroyed, a number of people see lights in the sky which seems to prove that the ambassadors from Argon were real. Meanwhile, Gulietta witnesses the Woodpecker's bombing and rats him out to Leigh-Cheri, who places him under citizen's arrest. Leigh-Cheri demands to know why Bernard wanted to destroy the CareFest, a cause dear to her heart. Bernard explains his outlaw philosophy, which is that freedom is more important than happiness. Leigh- Cheri is still skeptical, but begins to fall in love with Bernard. She takes him home to meet her parents, but after Bernard accidentally murders Queen Tilli's pet lapdog, he slips out in disgrace. Soon after, his outlaw past catches up with him, and he is taken back to prison. In solidarity, Leigh- Cheri transforms her attic bedroom into a copy of Bernard's prison cell, leaving her alone with only a bed, a lamp, and a package of Camel cigarettes. While contemplating the Camels, Leigh-Cheri deciphers a secret message, which she believes is from a line of red-haired Argonians. The message reads CHOICE. Bernard learns of Leigh-Cheri's self-imposed exile, since it has drawn media coverage and led to many other people locking themselves away in attics for their lost loves. Bernard hears this news in prison, and sends Leigh-Cheri a scathing letter denouncing her practices. After a revolution in the homeland, Gulietta is crowned the queen (they had wanted Leigh-Cheri, but after the whole attic incident, thought her too flaky) and Leigh-Cheri leaves her attic exile and agrees to marry the handsome, wealthy Prince A'ben Fizel, on the condition that he will build her a pyramid as a wedding gift. A'ben Fizel suspects that Leigh-Cheri still loves Bernard and sets spies to follow her. While exploring the completed pyramid the night before the wedding, Leigh- Cheri discovered Bernard, alive, preparing to set up dynamite to destroy the pyramid. While the two reconcile, A'ben Fizel seals the pyramid, trapping the lovers inside, and announces to the world that the princess has been kidnapped. In the meantime, Bernard and Leigh-Cheri, trapped in the pyramid, are living on wedding cake and champagne while they discuss the pyramids, redheads, the Moon, and the Argonian message on the box of Camel cigarettes. When they are almost completely out of supplies, Leigh-Cheri decides to use the dynamite to make an opening while Bernard sleeps, sacrificing her own life to save him. He tries to stop her, but the dynamite goes off anyway. They awaken in the hospital where they discover that they are both deaf. Max is so shaken by Leigh-Cheri's capture and reappearance that his heart gives out on him. Tilli goes back to Europe. Leigh-Cheri and Bernard move back to Seattle where they spend the rest of their days. Characters *King Max Furstenberg- Barcalona - the deposed king, former gambler, sports fanatic, enemy of blackberry brambles, and father of Leigh-Cheri. *Leigh-Cheri Furstenberg- Barcalona - the former princess, an idealist, nature-lover, and Ralph Nader supporter. *Queen Tilli Furstenberg-Barcalona - a former queen, silly and simple by nature, who listens to opera and plays with her dog; her favorite Americanism is \\"Oh-oh, spaghetti-o.\\" *Gulietta - a maid who does not speak English, is dependent upon cocaine, and is a secret heir. *Bernard Mickey (originally Baby) Wrangle - known by the nickname \\"Woodpecker,\\" he has anarchist leanings, is a self-proclaimed outlaw, and employs explosives to destroy buildings; his mantra is \\"Yum.\\" Major themes This novel is about the primacy of the individual and \\"metaphysical outlawism\\". Trivia The Dan Fogelberg song, \\"Make Love Stay,\\" was inspired by Still Life with Woodpecker and the lyrics to the La Dispute song, \\"One,\\" consist of quotes from the novel. In the movie, 50 First Dates, Drew Barrymore's character is found reading the book each morning during her breakfast, while also making waffle houses at the Hooki Lau cafe. The cover to the first edition is modeled after a pack of Camel cigarettes. The post-hardcore Band La Dispute used the Lyrics from Still Life with Woodpecker in their EP Here, Hear..

As different nodes or processes will typically not be perfectly synchronized, this algorithm is used to provide a partial ordering of events with minimal overhead, and conceptually provide a starting point for the more advanced vector clock method. The algorithm is named after its creator, Leslie Lamport. Distributed algorithms such as resource synchronization often depend on some method of ordering events to function. For example, consider a system with two processes and a disk. The processes send messages to each other, and also send messages to the disk requesting access. The disk grants access in the order the messages were received. For example process A sends a message to the disk requesting write access, and then sends a read instruction message to process B. Process B receives the message, and as a result sends its own read request message to the disk. If there is a timing delay causing the disk to receive both messages at the same time, it can determine which message happened-before the other: A happens-before B if one can get from A to B by a sequence of moves of two types: moving forward while remaining in the same process, and following a message from its sending to its reception. A logical clock algorithm provides a mechanism to determine facts about the order of such events. Lamport invented a simple mechanism by which the happened-before ordering can be captured numerically. A Lamport logical clock is a numerical software counter value maintained in each process. Conceptually, this logical clock can be thought of as a clock that only has meaning in relation to messages moving between processes. When a process receives a message, it re- synchronizes its logical clock with that sender. The above-mentioned vector clock is a generalization of the idea into the context of an arbitrary number of parallel, independent processes. Algorithm The algorithm follows some simple rules: # A process increments its counter before each event in that process; # When a process sends a message, it includes its counter value with the message; # On receiving a message, the counter of the recipient is updated, if necessary, to the greater of its current counter and the timestamp in the received message. The counter is then incremented by 1 before the message is considered received. In pseudocode, the algorithm for sending is: # event is known time = time + 1; # event happens send(message, time); The algorithm for receiving a message is: (message, time_stamp) = receive(); time = max(time_stamp, time) + 1; Considerations For every two different events a and b occurring in the same process, and C(x) being the timestamp for a certain event x, it is necessary that C(a) never equals C(b). Therefore it is necessary that: * The logical clock be set so that there is a minimum of one clock \\"tick\\" (increment of the counter) between events a and b; * In a multi- process or multi-threaded environment, it might be necessary to attach the process ID (PID) or any other unique ID to the timestamp so that it is possible to differentiate between events a and b which may occur simultaneously in different processes.  Causal ordering  For any two events, a and b, if there‚Äôs any way that a could have influenced b, then the Lamport timestamp of a will be less than the Lamport timestamp of b. It‚Äôs also possible to have two events where we can‚Äôt say which came first; when that happens, it means that they couldn‚Äôt have affected each other. If a and b can‚Äôt have any effect on each other, then it doesn‚Äôt matter which one came first.  Implications  A Lamport clock may be used to create a partial causal ordering of events between processes. Given a logical clock following these rules, the following relation is true: if a \\\\rightarrow b then C(a) < C(b), where \\\\rightarrow\\\\, means happened-before. This relation only goes one way, and is called the clock consistency condition: if one event comes before another, then that event's logical clock comes before the other's. The strong clock consistency condition, which is two way (if C(a) < C(b) then a \\\\rightarrow b), can be obtained by other techniques such as vector clocks. Using only a simple Lamport clock, only a partial causal ordering can be inferred from the clock. However, via the contrapositive, it's true that C(a) less C(b) implies a rightarrow b. So, for example, if C(a) \\\\geq C(b) then a cannot have happened-before b. Another way of putting this is that C(a) < C(b) means that a may have happened-before b, or be incomparable with b in the happened-before ordering, but a did not happen after b. Nevertheless, Lamport timestamps can be used to create a total ordering of events in a distributed system by using some arbitrary mechanism to break ties (e.g., the ID of the process). The caveat is that this ordering is artifactual and cannot be depended on to imply a causal relationship. Lamport's logical clock in distributed systems In a distributed system, it is not possible in practice to synchronize time across entities (typically thought of as processes) within the system; hence, the entities can use the concept of a logical clock based on the events through which they communicate. If two entities do not exchange any messages, then they probably do not need to share a common clock; events occurring on those entities are termed as concurrent events. Among the processes on the same local machine we can order the events based on the local clock of the system. When two entities communicate by message passing, then the send event is said to happen-before the receive event, and the logical order can be established among the events. A distributed system is said to have partial order if we can have a partial order relationship among the events in the system. If 'totality', i.e., causal relationship among all events in the system, can be established, then the system is said to have total order. A single entity cannot have two events occur simultaneously. If the system has total order we can determine the order among all events in the system. If the system has partial order between processes, which is the type of order Lamport's logical clock provides, then we can only tell the ordering between entities that interact. Lamport addressed ordering two events with the same timestamp (or counter): \\"To break ties, we use any arbitrary total ordering < of the processes.\\" Thus two timestamps or counters may be the same within a distributed system, but in applying the logical clocks algorithm events that occur will always maintain at least a strict partial ordering. Lamport clocks lead to a situation where all events in a distributed system are totally ordered. That is, if a \\\\rightarrow b, then we can say a actually happened before b. Note that with Lamport‚Äôs clocks, nothing can be said about the actual time of a and b. If the logical clock says C(a) < C(b), that does not mean in reality that a actually happened before b in terms of real time. Lamport clocks show non-causality, but do not capture all causality. Knowing a \\\\rightarrow c and b \\\\rightarrow c shows c did not cause a or b but we cannot say which initiated c. This kind of information can be important when trying to replay events in a distributed system (such as when trying to recover after a crash). If one node goes down, and we know the causal relationships between messages, then we can replay those messages and respect the causal relationship to get that node back up to the state it needs to be in.

The butterfly has white wings with grey or yellow markings near the center or tip of the wing. It flies slowly and low over its shrubbery habitat. Males initiate courtship with females and can mate multiply, while females tend to only mate once in their lifetime. The wood white was added to the UK BAP Priority Species list in 2005 due to a substantial decline in the population, especially in England. This decline has been attributed to changes in woodland regions, including increased shade due to tree planting, and the failure to maintain woodland rides in a satisfactory way for wood whites to oviposit. Conservation efforts are currently striving to understand how to best maintain woodland regions and are examining the effect of climate change (particularly during the winter months) on egg survival.  Taxonomy  There are several subspecies of L. sinapis. These subspecies are all found in nearby regions, and thus geographical variation is slight. The following subspecies are recognized: * L. s. sinapis (Linnaeus, 1758) Sweden, western Siberia, the southern Altai * L. s. pseudodiniensis (Pfeiffer, 1927) the Caucasus, Kopet- Dagh * L. s. melanoinspersa Verity, 1911 western and northern Tian-Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Alay Mountains * There is an uncertainly ranked form from Darvaz. These subspecies, although they look similar, are different in the physiology of their genitals and are reproductively isolated from the wood white due to female conspecific mating choice.  Geographic Range  The wood white is found in Europe and eastwards across the Caucasus, Asia Minor, the Middle East, Middle Asia, Kazakhstan and south Siberia to the Baikal region. Within Europe, the wood white is unevenly distributed across the Midlands and Southern England, as well as Northern Europe and Ireland. Since the species is currently depleting in size throughout England, it is primarily found in woodland pockets, such as the Haugh and Wigmore Woods of Herefordshire. L. sinapis is also found in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Sweden, France, Spain and Ireland.  Habitat  The wood white is found in the northern parts of the United Kingdom, largely in the clearings among woodlands or nearby shrubbery. They can often also be found in areas where there is substantial shelter, such as abandoned railway tracks and cliffs near the sea shore, as well as meadows, forest edges and sparse forests up to 2,500 m above sea level. One of the most consistently populous regions of northern England in terms of L. sinapis is in Herefordshire, particularly the Haugh Wood and Wigmore Rolls woodlands. The wood white requires habitats with substantial vegetation and shrubbery in order to lay eggs and pupate, however they are very particular about the amount of shade in their habitat. Substantial habitat loss for wood whites occurs as a result of too much shrubbery or shade in their living environments. They select very specific food-plants within these habitats.  Parental Care  = Ovipositioning = The female wood white flies near woodland areas with substantial shrubbery, and lays its eggs on tall food-plants. There are several preferred plants on which L. sinapis have been observed to lay their larva. These include Lotus pedunculatus, Lathyrus pratensis, and Lotus corniculatus. Researchers hypothesize that the height of the plant may influence the number of larva laid there‚Äîthe taller the plant, the more eggs expected. They tend to select these taller plants, and lay eggs on the underside of leaves in a single row. = Host plant learning and selection for egg laying = Female wood whites lay the eggs on very specific food-plants (such as Lotus pedunculatus, Lathyrus pratensis, and Lotus corniculatus) that they select through chemoreception via receptors on their feet. They fly low and slowly over the shrubbery and test several plants by landing on them and using their chemoreceptors.  Life Cycle  = Egg = Eggs hatch after 10‚Äì20 days, after which the larvae remain on the food plant and feed on its leaves. = Caterpillar = The development of the larvae is temperature-dependent, with a range of 35‚Äì60 days spent developing. There are, on average, four larval instars, which all tend to stay on the food-plant during development, eating the leaves of the plant onto which they hatched. The larvae are green and well camouflaged on their food plant. = Pupa = When the larvae are ready to pupate, they wander for a variable amount of time (minimum 1 hour, maximum a few days) until they find a location to pupate. The resulting pale green or brown pupae are generally found on grass stems and on rose plants. = Adult = Wood white eggAfter pupation, this species re-hatch into full grown wood white butterflies. The species is bivoltine, meaning that two generations hatch per year, during the months of late May through August.  Genetics  =Speciation= Leptidea sinapis is one of three species in a cryptic species complex. The other members of the cryptic species complex are L. reali and L. juvernica. Similar species are L. morsei, L. duponcheli and L. amurensis. The two other related species that have been classified (L. reali and L. juvernica) do not exhibit cross-mating. DNA and mitochondrial studies have shown that the two taxa are definitively different; although they appear the same in wing coloration and external appearance, they can be differentiated by their genitalia. A population genetic study of male L. sinapis, L. reali and L. juvernica individuals showed no evidence for gene flow after divergence. L. reali is found in Italy, Spain, and France, while L. juvernica is found more in England and Ireland, and other Nordic countries. They appear to be niche separated‚Äîthey utilize and inhabit different habitats. Male members of the two species try and mate with females of both species with equal frequency, but the females only mate with members of their own species. Researchers are attempting to understand the reason for the niche-separation of the two subspecies. The two species tend to lay eggs on the same plants, causing researchers to hypothesize that host-plant selection is not the primary reason for niche-separation and later speciation. The choice of host plant did not affect survival rates of either species to any significant degree, but the most common host plant for both larvae was L. pratensis. A newly hypothesized explanation for this habitat separation, or existence of mosaic habitats is the long courtship rituals that these butterflies have. A female would not want to be subjected to the long courtship ritual only to bear the cost of having hybridized offspring, so there is niche separation to prevent heterospecific mating. A female wood white  Migration  There is no local or regional migration of the wood white. The wood white is a bivoltine species, meaning that there are two generations of eggs that hatch in one year. The two generations of butterflies emerge and fly in May through June and secondly in July through August. Egg laying, hatching of the larvae, and pupation occur during the winter (over- wintering). Studies about how climate changes during the winter months affect pupation are being conducted to help develop conservation plans.  Mating  = Female-male interactions =  Mate choice  There are two reproductively isolated species of wood white called L. sinapis and L. reali. These two species can mate with each other (heterospecific mating), but it is in their best interest, for the viability and fecundity of their offspring, that they mate only within their species (conspecific mating). Male members of the two species try and court or mate with females of both species with equal frequency, but the females only mate with members of their own species. This female choice has caused the two species to diverge and become reproductively isolated. There is a time and energy cost that the females bear when males of the opposite species attempt to mate with them‚Äîthis cost has led to females occasionally acquiescing and mating with these males, leading to some degree of between-species hybridization.  Courting  There is an elaborate courtship ritual between wood whites, initiated by the male. They begin by wagging their head from one side to another, extending their proboscis towards the female. The female, with her antennae pulled back, would be unmoving if already mated and would immediately move their abdomen towards the male if not. Two wood whites courting  Copulation and number of mates  Females mate only once in nature, while males can mate several times. This can be explained by the competing pressures that each sex faces. wood white males would need to mate with as many conspecific females as possible to maximize the number of viable offspring, while females benefit from only mating once, since the egg-laying process of choosing the best food-plant on which to oviposit is so time and energy intensive‚Äîmating multiple times would not be a good use of resources.  Physiology  = Flight = Adult wood whites fly slowly, and they appear to flutter. Males spend the majority of their lifetime flying low over shrubbery to find possible mates. = Appearance = Wood white butterflies have white wings, sometimes with small grey or yellowish markings towards the middle or edge of the wing. Males have white-tipped antennae, while females have brown-tipped antennae. They have a 36-44mm wingspan.  As parasites  It had been long held that butterfly species feeding on nectar had served as pollinator vectors, but the L. sinapis demonstrates that this is not always the case. An analysis of the relationship between the Phlox-Coliasis pollination system and the L. sinapis which feeds on the nectar, displays that the pollination efficiency is around 1%, extremely low for the need to successfully pollinate the host population. Thus, rather than being considered a mutualistic relationship, the L. sinapis is considered a parasite to the flowers from which they feed.  Threats  = Predators = Predators of the wood white eggs are largely unknown, but lead to 90-98% of all egg deaths. = Parasites = The chalcid fly parasitizes the wood white eggs and accounts for only a small percentage of egg death. The larvae are parasitized by Cotesia vitripennis and C. anchisiades, which are two wasp species. = Habitat fluctuations = Rapid changes in shade (tree-cover, buildings, etc.) in the woodlands where the butterflies lay their eggs and moist or colder weather during ovipositing season contribute to the lower quantities of adult wood whites during the months of June through August.  Conservation  = Habitat loss = The wood white butterfly was named a UK BAP Priority Species candidate in 2005, due to the substantial drop in population size in the last quarter century. There are several habitat-related reasons behind the drop in wood white butterfly. Researchers hypothesize that this could be due to the changing treatment of woodland areas, including over-planting of trees. Many of the woodlands where wood whites colonize were replanted in the last 50 years, leading to a large increase in the amount of shade over the woodland rides and shrubbery. Very little is understood about how to upkeep woodland areas so that they are sufficient for wood white colonization; this is the main area of research on conversation presently. = Conservation efforts = There have been efforts to recolonize areas of the United Kingdom as part of a 10-year plan to reintroduce more wood whites into the area. This recolonization involves maintaining woodland ride areas to minimize loss of vegetation and dispersing the butterflies strategically into woodland ride areas in Britain. Another major point of interest for the conservation effort is to examine how weather and climate change, particularly in the winter, affects pupation, since this process largely takes place over winter (called overwintering of the pupae).200px  See also  * List of butterflies of Great Britain References  External links  * Jim Asher et al.

When Miguel became titular commander-in-chief of the army, he had Travassos Valdez removed from his post and sent into exile in Set√∫bal, where the 'Parc Bonfim' now commemorates his time there; but after the prince overreached himself in April 1825, with an attempted coup (known as the Abrilada) and was sent into exile, Travassos Valdez was reinstated. After the death of King Jo√£o VI, a Spanish army invaded Portugal to restore Absolutist rule; Travassos Valdez, with just 900 men, opposed 6,000 Spaniards at Bragan√ßa, delaying their advance until the government was able to raise sufficient forces to oppose them. However, the Spaniards captured Travassos Valdez and sent him to Spain; but he escaped and returned to Portugal. He then declined the governorship of Portuguese Angola, offered him by the regent, Dona Isabel Maria, and was instead made Captain General (governor) of Madeira and Porto Santo in 1827.Francisco Travassos Valdez (1861), pp. 7‚Äì8. When Dom Miguel returned and seized power from the rightful heir, his niece Maria II, and proclaimed himself 'Absolute King', Travassos Valdez held out in Madeira until his defence of the island was overwhelmed by an expeditionary force despatched from Portugal. As Miguel had given orders that Travassos Valdez should be hanged if captured, he was forced to flee the Portuguese realms and, with his wife, brother, and six children, sailed to England under the protection of the British Royal Navy in September 1828. He joined the many refugees from Dom Miguel's tyranny and in 1832 made his way to the Azores to join the expedition of Dom Pedro I of Brazil, father of Maria II and formerly Emperor of Brazil, to restore Maria to her throne and constitutional rule to Portugal. Pedro's expeditionary force landed in Portugal in 1832 and was besieged for a year in the city of Porto. After the Battle of Ponte Ferreira, when Dom Pedro instituted changes in his high command, Travassos Valdez exercised the functions of Adjutant-General and chief of the General Staff of the Army of Liberation. During the major Miguelite assault on the city on September 29, 1832, Travassos Valdez was severely wounded defending the redoubt at the Bonfim church; from this, he later took his title of nobility. A year later, on September 5, 1833, he was again wounded at the siege of Lisbon, which the Constitutionalists had wrested from Dom Miguel. Dom Miguel was at last defeated in 1834 and sent into exile, this time permanently.  Insurrections and political office  Dom Pedro died immediately after his victory and a long period of political unrest between competing factions began under the young queen Maria II. Governments came and went, mostly lasting only a few months. On September 17, 1835 Travassos Valdez was elevated to the peerage as Baron Bonfim. From October 1836 he commanded forces in the Alentejo against the Spanish Carlist general, Miguel G√≥mez Damas, who was threatening the frontier. In 1837 he was elected deputy for the constituents of the district of Leiria to the parliament. When the Chartist forces raised an insurrection against the government on July 12, 1837, and the Dukes of Saldanha and Terceira put themselves at its head, according to an early 20th-century account: \\"The Lisbon government confided extraordinary powers to the Viscount de S√° and the baron de Bonfim. These two officers, with the constitutional forces, attacked the marshals' troops at Rio Maior on the 28th of August, and, although on both sides they had more than six weeks in which to make preparations, neither of the armies counted 800 men. But the soldiers were more prudent than their leaders. After a slight infantry skirmish in which the Portuguese had sensible losses to deplore, the marshals gave the order to charge to their little squadron and the Viscount de S√° advanced at the head of his troop. The cavalry on both sides stopped at 50 paces, replaced their sabres in their scabbards, and having fraternised returned faithfully to the flags of their respective commanders. The latter saw themselves compelled to sign an armistice and the marshals retired to the North.\\"The Historians' History of the World edited by Henry Smith Williams (London: The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Co. Ltd., 1904 (5th edition 1926), Volume X, p. 552. On September 9, 1837 Bonfim was appointed Minister of War and interim Foreign Minister and Minister of Marine in the second government of S√° de Bandeira. Among his acts in this office, following the crushing of the Chartist rebellion at the Battle of Ruiv√£es on September 20, 1837, was disarming the National Guard, which had been converted into a permanent force for insurrection. On March 13, 1838 he used troops to put down a revolt by rebels who had occupied the Lisbon Arsenal, a decisive act that probably prevented the fall of the liberal government. By a Decree of D. Maria II of April 4, 1838 he was elevated to the Nobility, as Count of Bonfim. (The family tended to use the older spelling 'Bomfim'.) He was a senator in the legislature of 1839‚Äì40.and deputy for the constituents of the district of Leiria. On September 26, 1839 he assumed the leadership of the government as Prime Minister, and provided the first period of relative stability by presiding over the eleventh government, a coalition which succeeded in remaining in office for nearly two years, until 1841. He retained the office of Foreign Minister until December 28, 1839. Bonfim‚Äôs administration, in which he combined the posts of Prime Minister, Minister of War, and head of the Colonial Department, lasted to June 9, 1841. Among those taking office in his ministry were Costa Cabral, Rodrigo da Fonseca Magalh√£es and others. It was during the period of his government that various European powers (among them, the Holy See) resumed diplomatic relations with Portugal, having broken them off after the arrival of the constitutional regime. He especially cultivated friendly relations with Spain after the tensions of the Carlist War. He was responsible for the foundation in July 1840 of the fortress and town of Moss√¢medes in southern Angola and he promoted internal pacification in Portugal. On December 26, 1840, Portugal and the United States of America signed a Mutual Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Bonfim resigned the premiership when he encountered resistance to his plans to reform the National Guard, and was succeeded in office by Joaquim Ant√≥nio de Aguiar, who had been his deputy.  Later years and progeny  After the coup d'√©tat of 1842, which brought the Costa Cabral government to power, the Count of Bonfim became its most implacable opponent.The Historians' History of the World, Volume X, p. 555. In 1844 he raised the standard of rebellion against Costa Cabral's dictatorial policies but his associates were imprisoned or forced to flee the country and he himself left PortugalFrancisco Travassos Valdez (1861), p. 10 until the rebellion of Maria da Fonte in 1846. When the anti-Cabralist government of the Duke of Palmela took office Bonfim returned to Portugal, but in October the palace coup known as the Emboscada brought a new government of Cabralist sympathies to power, headed by the Duke of Saldanha. In the ensuing 'Little Civil War' or Patuleia, Travassos Valdez supported the revolutionary Junta of Porto against the more conservative forces around the Queen and took command of the 'Progressista' army.Francisco Travassos Valdez (1861), pp. 10‚Äì11 Expected reinforcement from the troops commanded by the Conde of Antas, the President of the Junta, was not forthcoming in time, and Bonfim and his army were besieged by Saldanha in the fortress of Torres Vedras and defeated, December 22‚Äì23, 1846. In violation of their safe-conduct, Bonfim, his two eldest sons and various political associates were exiled to Mo√ß√¢medes in southern Angola. He escaped from there with his sons in a skiff, intending to sail to Saint Helena, but was recaptured; the safe return of the exiles by the British Royal Navy and their honourable reinstatement was a condition of the Peace negotiated by the Four Powers at the Convention of Gramido, 1847. Bonfim and his associates were repatriated to Portugal in the British frigate HMS Terrible, returning to Lisbon on October 9, and his rank and honours were restored. After 1851 he was appointed head of the Supreme Council of Military Justice, and on his death in Lisbon in 1862 was accorded a state funeral. He had married (February 21, 1813) D. Jer√≥nima Em√≠lia Godinho Valdez, daughter of Jos√© Ricardo Godinho Valdez, 14th lord Quinta de Flandres, Pombal, and administrator of N. Sr.¬™ das Neves and Marco, and his wife D. Maria Joana Travassos da Silveira. (Travassos Valdez's wife was his first cousin twice over, being the daughter of his father's sister and his mother's brother.) Among the most notable of his children, the eldest son Jos√© Bento Travassos Valdez (1814‚Äì1881) was Colonial Secretary of Angola in 1841‚Äì45, shared his father's exile in 1846‚Äì47 and became 2nd Count of Bonfim; the second son Lu√≠s Travassos Valdez (1816‚Äì1900) attained the rank of General and was a distinguished writer on military affairs; the third son Ant√≥nio Travassos Valdez (1818‚Äì1855) entered the diplomatic service, edited the first annual report of the conduct of affairs published by the Foreign Ministry and died as Portuguese ambassador to Denmark; and the fourth son was the noted travel writer and anti-slavery campaigner Francisco Travassos Valdez (1825‚Äì1892). A sixth son, Pedro de Alc√¢ntara Travassos Valdez (1827‚Äì1887), settled in the English village of Dalwood in Devon and is buried in the graveyard of St Peter's Church there, with an elaborate headstone summarizing his father's career.Dalwood.

Male (up) and female (down) Distribution and ecology Colias croceus is one of the most-widespread species in Europe. The common clouded yellow's breeding range is North Africa and southern Europe and eastwards through Turkey into the Middle East but it occurs throughout much of Europe as a summer migrant, in good years individuals reaching Scandinavia. In Asia, its range extends into central Siberia in the north and barely into India in the south; it is not found in Central Asia.FunetFauna europaea This species is primarily an immigrant to the UK, originating from southern Europe and northern Africa.UK Butterflies In the UK they can be seen on the south coast almost every year in varying numbers, and regularly breed there. Occurrence in the rest of the UK varies considerably from year to year, but they are increasingly observed as far north as Dumfries and Galloway. It has also been recorded in Ireland from the Raven, Co. Wexford, to Belfast, Co. Down. A truly migratory European butterfly, this species is famous for occasional mass migrations and subsequent breeding, which are often referred to in the United Kingdom as \\"clouded yellow years\\". Notable clouded yellow years include 1877, 1947, 1983, 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2000. Habitat These butterflies may live in any open area in the countryside, including downland, coastal cliffs and fields containing the caterpillar's host plants, at an elevation up to above sea level. Description Colias croceus has a wingspan of .Simon Coombes Captain's European Butterfly GuideSvenska fj√§rilar The upperside of the wings is golden to orange yellow with a broad black margin on all four wings and a black spot near the centre forewing. Usually these butterflies settles with its wings closed, consequently the black margin of the uppersides of the wings is difficultly visible. The underside lacks the black borders and is lighter, with a more greenish tint, particularly on the forewings. In the forewing underside is the same dark spot as on the upperside, but often with a light centre; the hindwing underside has a white centre spot, often with a smaller white or dark dot immediately above it. Sometimes, a row of black dots occurs on the underwings' outer margins, corresponding to where the black border ends on the upperside. Females differ from the males in having yellow spots along the black borders on the upperside. In flight, Colias croceus is easily identifiable by the intense yellow colouring, much brighter than that of the lemon-yellow male common brimstone which also lacks black markings. Like all Colias species they never open their wings at rest. In a small proportion of females (about 5%) the golden upperside colouration is replaced by a pale cream colour. These females have been distinguished as form helice. The pale form helice does not seem to be that distinct as intermediates exist and the variation is to some extent related to humidity during development, with dryer conditions producing paler colouration. These pale forms helice can be confused with Berger's clouded yellow (Colias alfacariensis) and the rarer Pale clouded yellow (Colias hyale). Even the palest C. croceus tends to have more black on the upperside however, in particular on the hindwings. Young caterpillars are yellow-green, with a black head. Later they become completely dark green, with a white red spotted lateral line after the third moult. The pupae are green and have a yellow side stripe.Naturkundliches Informationssystem This species is rather similar to Colias myrmidone, Colias chrysotheme, Colias erate, Colias hyale, Colias alfacariensis, Colias caucasica, Colias aurorina.Lepiforum.de =Life cycle and larval host plants= Adults fly from March to October. In southern Europe and North Africa they breed continuously throughout the year. Eggs are laid singly on food plant leaves. Usually an extraordinary number of eggs ‚Äì up to 600 ‚Äì are laid from a single female. The caterpillars grow fast in warm weather, sometimes pupating within a month. Caterpillars have 4 moults in total. The pupa remains attached to a foodplant stem by a silk girdle. Pupation lasts for two or three weeks and in good years there can be as many as three generations per year, with adults still on the wing at the beginning of November. Larvae feed on a variety of leguminous plants, namely Faboideae (Trifolium pratense, Medicago sativa, Medicago lappacea, Medicago hispida, Medicago polymorpha, Medicago sulcata, Vicia, Lotus, Onobrychis, Astragalus, Colutea arborescens, Hippocrepis, and Anthyllis species). In the UK wild and cultivated clovers (Trifolium) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) are favourites; less frequently, common bird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus is eaten. Adults feed primarily on nectar of thistles (Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.), knapweeds (Centaurea spp.), dandelion (Taraxacum), fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), marjoram (Origanum vulgare), ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), and vetches (Vicia spp.).

The Stanzas formed the basis for The Secret Doctrine (1888), one of the foundational works of the theosophical movement, by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. Madame Blavatsky's claims regarding the Book of Dzyan Madame Blavatsky claimed to have seen a manuscript of the Book of Dzyan while studying esoteric lore in Tibet. She claimed this and other ancient manuscripts were safeguarded from profane eyes by the initiates of an Occult Brotherhood. The work had originally, according to Blavatsky, been written in the sacred language of Senzar. She wrote The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 1, Page xxxvii Stanzas, which are (...) said to emanate from a source (Occultism) repudiated by science; :This first installment of the esoteric doctrines is based upon Stanzas, which are the records of a people unknown to ethnology; it is claimed that they are written in a tongue absent from the nomenclature of languages and dialects with which philology is acquainted; they are said to emanate from a source (Occultism) repudiated by science; and, finally, they are offered through an agency, incessantly discredited before the world by all those who hate unwelcome truths, or have some special hobby of their own to defend. Therefore, the rejection of these teachings may be expected, and must be accepted beforehand. No one styling himself a \\"scholar,\\" in whatever department of exact science, will be permitted to regard these teachings seriously. Others have been skeptical. Max M√ºller is reported to have said that ‚Äòin this matter she was either a remarkable forger or that she has made the most valuable gift to archeological research in the Orient.‚ÄôAlvin Boyd Kuhn. Theosophy: A Modern Revival of Ancient Wisdom (New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, 1939), Chapter VIII, page 195. The Book of Dzyan and the Buddhist Tantras In other references Blavatsky claimed the Book of Dzyan belonged to a group of Tibetan esoteric writings known as the Books of Kiu-Te. Blavatsky wrote before a standard transcription of Tibetan into the Latin alphabet had been agreed upon; it took David Reigle some time to establish that she was referring to what modern scholars write as rGyud-sde (gy√º de, section of tantras) parts of a voluminous Buddhist corpus commonly referred to as the Tantras.David and Nancy Reigle. Blavatsky's Secret Books (San Diego: Wizards Bookshelf, 1999). Other researchers have suggested a source in Chinese Taoism or Jewish kabbala.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. Helena Blavatsky (Berkeley: North Atlantic Books, 2006). In Isis Unveiled Blavatsky herself identifies Senzar as being \\"ancient Sanskrit\\" (Isis, I, 440). As noted by John Algeo in his book, Blavatsky's other statements about Senzar (including the above linkage to Sanskrit) create a number of puzzles, which make it difficult to take the etymological language family references literally, since some link to Egyptian sources, while yet others are still of other roots. The Stanzas of Dzyan in the works of other authors Supposed verses from the same Stanzas of Dzyan were later published by Alice Bailey in A Treatise on Cosmic Fire in 1925. Bailey claimed these verses had been dictated to her telepathically by the Tibetan Master Djwal Kul. Ufologist Desmond Leslie drew heavily on the Stanzas of Dzyan in his writing,Desmond Leslie & George Adamski: Flying Saucers Have Landed, London: Werner Laurie, 1953 and theorized that they had originally been produced on the lost continent of Atlantis. Swiss author Erich von D√§niken claimed to have explored some of the book's content and its alleged history, reporting unsourced rumours that the first version of the book predates Earth, and that chosen people who simply touch the book will receive visions of what it describes.Erich von D√§niken. Gods From Outer Space (New York: Bantam Books, 1972), p. 137. References to the Stanzas exist in the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft, for example in his short story \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\",The Haunter of the Dark and have been expanded upon by other writers who have worked within the Cthulhu Mythos. Criticism regarding the sources of the Stanzas of Dzyan When The Secret Doctrine appeared, William Emmette Coleman was ‚Äúoutraged by Madame Blavatksy‚Äôs pretensions of Oriental learning, [and] undertook a complete exegesis of her works.\\"William Emmette Coleman, \\"The Sources of Madame Blavatsky's Writings\\", in Vsevolod Sergeevich Solov'ev, A Modern Priestess of Isis, Appendix C, pp. 353-366 (London: Longmans & Co., 1895). Available as a free download He claimed that her main sources were H.H. Wilson's translations of the Vishnu Purana; Alexander Winchell‚Äôs World Life: or, Contemporary Geology; Ignatius Donnely‚Äôs Atlantis: The Antediluvian World (1882); and other contemporary scientific and occult works, plagiarized without credit and, in his own opinion, used in a blundering manner that showed superficial acquaintance with the subjects under discussion. He further claimed that she took at least part of her Stanzas of Dzyan from the Hymn of Creation in the old Sanskrit Rig-Veda. Coleman promised a book that would expose all of H.P.B.‚Äôs sources including that of the word Dzyan.L. Sprague de Camp. Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature (New York: The Gnome Press Inc., 1954; reprint: Dover Publications, 1970), pp. 57-58. Historian Ronald H. Fritze notes that: > [Blavatsky] claimed to have received her information during trances in which > the Masters of Mahatmas of Tibet communicated with her and allowed her to > read from the ancient Book of Dzyan. The Book of Dzyan was supposedly > composed in Atlantis using the lost language of Senzar but the difficulty is > that no scholar of ancient languages in the 1880s or since has encountered > the slightest passing reference to the Book of Dzyan or the Senzar language. In her biography HPB: The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Blavatsky, Sylvia Cranston tackles the claim of plagiarism that was leveled by William Emmette Coleman.Sylvia Cranston. H.P.B.: The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (New York: Tarcher/Putnam, 1993), p. 379-387. Her view, like Coleman's, is that HPB's plagiarism consisted of quoting primary sources, without acknowledging the secondary sources from which they came. Cranston states that a research assistant of hers took on the task of finding Coleman's alleged 70 passages that HPB plagiarized from World- Life, and could only find 6. Coleman himself, far from being an authority on occult material, was a clerk in the Quartermaster Department of the US Army. He was likely not an impartial judge, having written to Coues on July 8, 1890, \\"I emphatically denounced and ridiculed the theory of occultism, of elementary spirits, etc., before the Theosophical Society was organized [in 1875], and from that time to this I have strenuously opposed Theosophy all the time.\\" Cranston, op.cit. p 380, citing William Q Judge, The Esoteric She, reprinted in H. P. Blavatsky: Her Life and Work. Coleman promised to publish a book that would \\"prove\\" his charges against Blavatsky regarding the Book of Dzyan; this book and its proof never appeared.Sylvia Cranston. H.P.B.: The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (New York: Tarcher/Putnam, 1993), p. 384. The reason Coleman's book never appeared is that ‚ÄúColeman lost his library and his notes in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and died three years later, his book unwritten‚Äù.L. Sprague de Camp.

Some Burundian artisans have special songs to accompany different stages of their work.  Media   Literature and oral tradition  During the 1972 genocide, many Burundians involved in higher education were killed, stalling written culture. This combined with the lower literacy rate have encouraged an adherence to Burundi's strong oral tradition, which relays history and life lessons through storytelling, poetry, and song.

Many Burundians celebrate Christian holidays and Burundian Independence Day, though the largest celebration occurs on New Year's Day with feasting and traditional drumming and dancing.  Cuisine  Burundian cuisine utilises maize and bananas as staple foods and often contains red kidney beans. Meals are not usually accompanied by sweet foods or dessert. During celebrations and gatherings, Burundians drink homemade banana wine and beer, sometimes drinking through straws from a single large container.

Despite the differences in size and coloration, it is sometimes mistaken for American red squirrels or eastern gray squirrels in areas where the species co-exist.  Description  The squirrel's total body length measures , tail length is , and they range in weight from . There is no sexual dimorphism in size or appearance. Individuals tend to be smaller in the west. There are three distinct geographical phases in coloration: In most areas the animals upper body is brown-grey to brown-yellow with a typically brownish- orange underside, while in eastern regions such as the Appalachians there are more strikingly-patterned dark brown and black squirrels with white bands on the face and tail. In the south can be found isolated communities with uniform black coats. To help with climbing, they have sharp claws, developed extensors of digits and flexors of forearms, and abdominal musculature. Fox squirrels have excellent vision and well-developed senses of hearing and smell. They use scent marking to communicate with other fox squirrels. \\"Fox squirrels also have several sets of vibrissae, hairs or whiskers that are used as touch receptors to sense the environment. These are found above and below their eyes, on their chin and nose, and on each forearm.\\" The dental formula of S. niger is . Fox squirrel foraging in the grass in Indianapolis, Indiana. Distribution The fox squirrel's natural range extends through most of the eastern United States, north into the southern prairie provinces of Canada, and west to the Dakotas, Colorado, and Texas. They are absent (except for vagrants) in New England, New Jersey, most of New York, northern and eastern Pennsylvania, Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces of Canada. They have been introduced to both northern and southern California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Washington, and New Mexico. While very versatile in their habitat choices, fox squirrels are most often found in forest patches of 40 hectares or less with an open understory, or in urban neighborhoods with trees. They thrive best among oak, hickory, walnut, pecan and pine trees, storing their nuts for winter. Western range extensions in Great Plains regions such as Kansas are associated with riverine corridors of cottonwood. A subspecies native to several eastern US states is the Delmarva fox squirrel (S. n. cinereus).Van Gelden, Richard George. (1982). Mammals of the National Parks. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press Habitat Fox squirrels are most abundant in open forest stands with little understory vegetation; they are not found in stands with dense undergrowth. Ideal habitat is small stands of large trees interspersed with agricultural land. The size and spacing of pines and oaks are among the important features of fox squirrel habitat. The actual species of pines and oaks themselves may not always be a major consideration in defining fox squirrel habitat. Fox squirrels are often observed foraging on the ground several hundred meters from the nearest woodlot. Fox squirrels also commonly occupy forest edge habitat.Dueser, Raymond D.; Dooley, James L., Jr.; Taylor, Gary J. (1988). Habitat structure, forest composition and landscape dimensions as components of habitat suitability for the Delmarva fox squirrel. In: Management of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals in North America: Proceedings of the symposium; 1988 July 19‚Äì21; Flagstaff, AZ. Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-166. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station: 414‚Äì421 Fox squirrels have two types of shelters: leaf nests (dreys) and tree dens. They may have two tree cavity homes or a tree cavity and a leaf nest. Tree dens are preferred over leaf nests during the winter and for raising young. When den trees are scarce, leaf nests are used year-round.Banfield, A. W. F. (1974). The mammals of Canada. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press.MacClintock, Dorcas. (1970). Squirrels of North America. New York: Litton Educational Publishing, Inc. Leaf nests are built during the summer months in forks of deciduous trees about 30 feet (9 m) above the ground. Fox squirrels use natural cavities and crotches (forked branches of a tree) as tree dens. Den trees in Ohio had an average diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of and were an average of from the nearest woodland border. About 88% of den trees in eastern Texas had an average d.b.h. of or more. Dens are usually wide and inches deep. Den openings are generally circular and about . Fox squirrels may make their own den in a hollow tree by cutting through the interior; however, they generally use natural cavities or cavities created by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) or red-headed woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus). Crow nests have also been used by fox squirrels. Fox squirrels use leaf nests or tree cavities for shelter and litter rearing. Forest stands dominated by mature to over mature trees provide cavities and a sufficient number of sites for leaf nests to meet the cover requirements. Overstory trees with an average d.b.h. of or more generally provide adequate cover and reproductive habitat. Optimum tree canopy closure for fox squirrels is from 20% to 60%. Optimum conditions of understory closure occur when the shrub-crown closure is 30% or less.Allen, A. W. 1982. Habitat suitability index models: fox squirrel. FWS/OBS-82/10.18. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service Fox squirrels are tolerant of human proximity, and even thrive in crowded urban and suburban environments. They exploit human habitations for sources of food and nesting sites, being as happy nesting in an attic as they are in a hollow tree. Diet Backyard fox squirrel searching for a location to bury its acorn, in Berkeley, California Manipulation of food items by paws and head Eating a Santa Rosa plum in Fullerton, California Food habits of fox squirrels depend largely on geographic location.Chapman, Joseph A.; Feldhamer, George A., eds. 1982. Wild mammals of North America. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press In general, fox squirrel foods include mast, tree buds, insects, tubers, bulbs, roots, bird eggs, seeds of pines and spring-fruiting trees, and fungi. Agricultural crops such as corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, and fruit are also eaten. Mast eaten by fox squirrels commonly includes turkey oak (Quercus laevis), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), post oak (Quercus stellata), and live oak (Quercus virginiana). In Illinois, fox squirrels rely heavily on hickories from late August through September. Pecans, black walnuts (Juglans nigra), osage orange (Maclura pomifera) fruits, and corn are also important fall foods. In early spring, elm buds and seeds are the most important food. In May and June, mulberries (Morus spp.) are heavily used. By early summer, corn in the milk stage becomes a primary food. During the winter in Kansas, osage orange is a staple item supplemented with seeds of the Kentucky coffee tree (Gymnocladus dioicus) and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), corn, wheat, eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides var. deltoides) bark, ash seeds, and eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) berries. In the spring, fox squirrels feed primarily on buds of elm, maple, and oaks but also on newly sprouting leaves and insect larvae. Fox squirrels in Ohio prefer hickory nuts, acorns, corn, and black walnuts. The squirrels are absent where two or more of these mast trees are missing. Fox squirrels also eat buckeyes, seeds and buds of maple and elm, hazelnuts (Corylus spp.), blackberries (Rubus spp.), and tree bark. In March, they feed mainly on buds and seeds of elm, maple, and willow. In Ohio, eastern fox squirrels have the following order of food preference: white oak (Quercus alba) acorns, black oak (Quercus velutina) acorns, red oak (Quercus rubra) acorns, walnuts, and corn. In eastern Texas, fox squirrels prefer the acorns of bluejack oak, pecans, southern red oak (Q. falcata), and overcup oak (Q. lyrata). The least preferred foods are acorns of swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii) and overcup oak. In California, fox squirrels feed on English walnuts (J. regia), oranges, avocados, strawberries, and tomatoes. In midwinter, they feed on eucalyptus seeds. In Michigan, fox squirrels feed on a variety of foods throughout the year. Spring foods are mainly tree buds and flowers, insects, bird eggs, and seeds of red maple (Acer rubrum), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), and elms. Summer foods include a variety of berries, plum and cherry pits, fruits of basswood (Tilia americana), fruits of box elder (Acer negundo), black oak acorns, hickory nuts, seeds of sugar (Acer saccharum) and black maple (Acer nigrum), grains, insects, and unripe corn. Fall foods consist mainly of acorns, hickory nuts, beechnuts, walnuts, butternuts (Juglans cinerea), and hazelnuts. Caches of acorns and hickory nuts are heavily used in winter. Behavior Fox squirrels are strictly diurnal, non-territorial, and spend more of their time on the ground than most other tree squirrels. They are still, however, agile climbers. They construct two types of homes called \\"dreys\\", depending on the season. Summer dreys are often little more than platforms of sticks high in the branches of trees, while winter dens are usually hollowed out of tree trunks by a succession of occupants over as many as 30 years. Cohabitation of these dens is not uncommon, particularly among breeding pairs. Fox squirrels will form caches by burying food items for later consumption. They like to store foods that are shelled and high in fat, such as acorns and nuts. Shelled foods are favored because they are less likely to spoil than non-shelled foods, and fatty foods are valued for their high energy density. They are not particularly gregarious or playful, in fact they have been described as solitary and asocial creatures, coming together only in breeding season. They have a large vocabulary, consisting most notably of an assortment of clucking and chucking sounds, not unlike some \\"game\\" birds, and they warn of approaching threats with distress screams. In the spring and fall, groups of fox squirrels clucking and chucking together can make a small ruckus. They also make high-pitched whines during mating. When threatening another fox squirrel, they will stand upright with their tail over their back and flick it. They are impressive jumpers, easily spanning fifteen feet in horizontal leaps and free-falling twenty feet or more to a soft landing on a limb or trunk. Reproduction Pup Female fox squirrels come into estrus in mid- December or early January, then again in June. They normally produce two litters a year; however, yearling females may only produce one. Females become sexually mature at 10 to 11 months of age and usually produce their first litter when they are a year old. Gestation occurs over a period of 44 to 45 days. Earliest litters appear in late January; most births occur in mid-March and July. The average litter size is three, but can vary according to season and food conditions. Tree cavities, usually those formed by woodpeckers, are remodeled to winter dens and often serve as nurseries for late winter litters. If existing trees lack cavities, leaf nests known as dreys are built by cutting twigs with leaves and weaving them into warm, waterproof shelters. Similar leafy platforms are built for summer litters and are often referred to as \\"cooling beds.\\" Tree squirrels develop slowly compared to other rodents. At birth, the young are blind, without fur and helpless. Eyes open at 4 to 5 weeks of age and ears open at 6 weeks. Eastern fox squirrels are weaned between 12 and 14 weeks but may not be self-supporting until 16 weeks. Juveniles usually disperse in September or October, but may den either together or with their mother during their first winter. Mortality Fox squirrel pausing from building its nest in an attic in Berkeley, California. In captivity, fox squirrels have been known to live 18 years, but in the wild most fox squirrels die before they become adults. Their maximum life expectancy is typically 12.6 years for females and 8.6 years for males. Because of overhunting and the destruction of mature forests, many subspecies of fox squirrel (the Delmarva fox squirrel for example) are endangered. Another major cause of fox squirrel population decline is mange mite (Cnemidoptes sp.) along with severe winter weather. Relatively few natural predators can regularly capture adult fox squirrels. Of these predators, most only take fox squirrels opportunistically. Fox squirrel predators include: bobcats (Felis rufus), foxes (Vulpes spp. and Urocyon spp.), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), barred owls (Strix varia), and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Nestlings and young fox squirrels are particularly vulnerable to climbing predators such as raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginiana), rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta), and pine snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus). In those states where fox squirrels are not protected, they are considered a game animal. Fox squirrels were an important source of meat for European settlers in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are still hunted over most of their range. Overhunting has been reported from small woodlots and public shooting areas in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana.

Limestone slab, 271 by 12 in., found in 1961 in digging a grave in the new cemetery on the west side of the Roman W ditch (see above, p.167). The stone had been re-used to form a medieval grave-cover, and in this process the lower moulding and part of 1\\\\. 3 had been trimmed off, and on the back the upper and lower edges had been chamfered. As the height of the letters in 1. 2 is 34 in. and substantially exceeds the height of 2-1 in. of 1. i, it seems likely that the text is complete; it reads: DEO VIRIDIO TRENICO ARCVM FECITDESVODON If the text is complete Trenico must be the dedicator and subject of fecit and don(avit). The god Viridios is unmatched. The Latin inscription may be translated in English as: For the god Viridius, Trenico made this arch, donated from his own funds.

Etymology of the name The Ancaster inscriptions are in Latin, suggesting that the name of the god is also in Latin. If so, the name is used in the dative form, meaning to (the deity). The nominative form, and therefore the name of the god, would be Viridius or Viridios. Because of the Latin word viridis (green, fresh, vigorous), the simplest etymology proposed is that the god's name derives from this root word and refers to a local, tribal Roman god possessing these characteristics. The Green Man is a well-known pagan mythic personage whose human face sprouting green leaves or vines is found in some medieval churches. Significant speculation exists as to the possible Celtic origins of the deity.Lincolnshire Museums Information Sheet. Archaeology Series No. 8 - Gods and Goddesses of Roman Ancaster. https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/assets/downloads/IS_arch_8_gods_and_goddesses_of_roman_ancaster.pdf Wright specifically addresses such speculations, but notes that such a connection cannot be affirmatively made as there are no firm historico- linguistic connections in evidence between the modern conception of Viridios as a Celtic deity and the god Viridios referenced on the inscriptions: For the stem of Trenico there is a Dobunnian Trenus cited on a diploma (CIL XVI, no. 49). Holder (Altcelt. Sprachsch.) cites nine examples of -ico for men's names. Professor K. Jackson concurs in 'lively', 'vigorous', or 'virile' as the probable translation of Viridios, but says that certainty is unattainable as there are no derivatives in medieval or modern Celtic languages. Related archaeological evidence An additional limestone figurative carving, probably used as an altarpiece, was also found near Ancaster and dated to the late Iron Age. Portable Aniquities Scheme. https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/52144 The carving depicts a naked man holding an axe, standing beneath an archway. While no inscriptions appear on the stone, the location of the find near Ancaster, and the features displayed on the god that may depict suggested meanings of the name Viridios (mighty, virile, verdant, fertile), have led some to speculate that the altarpiece is a depiction of the god Viridios.

It can also be used for radiolabeling. This process is called nick translation because the DNA to be processed is treated with DNAase to produce single- stranded \\"nicks\\". This is followed by replacement in nicked sites by DNA polymerase I, which elongates the 3' hydroxyl terminus, removing nucleotides by 5'-3' exonuclease activity, replacing them with dNTPs. To radioactively label a DNA fragment for use as a probe in blotting procedures, one of the incorporated nucleotides provided in the reaction is radiolabeled in the alpha phosphate position. Similarly, a fluorophore can be attached instead for fluorescent labelling, or an antigen for immunodetection. When DNA polymerase I eventually detaches from the DNA, it leaves another nick in the phosphate backbone. The nick has \\"translated\\" some distance depending on the processivity of the polymerase. This nick could be sealed by DNA ligase, or its 3' hydroxyl group could serve as the template for further DNA polymerase I activity. Proprietary enzyme mixes are available commercially to perform all steps in the procedure in a single incubation. Nick translation could cause double-stranded DNA breaks, if DNA polymerase I encounters another nick on the opposite strand, resulting in two shorter fragments. This does not influence the performance of the labelled probe in in-situ hybridization.

He was the owner of French Riviera casinos and hotels. Biography He was born on December 4, 1877, in Manhattan, New York City to Jay Gould and Helen Day Miller (1838‚Äì1889) On December 1, 1901, he married Helen Margaret Kelly and had two daughters, Helen Gould and Dorothy Gould (1904‚Äì1969). They divorced in 1908. The Wichita Daily Times, Wichita Falls, Texas, wrote: \\"Frank Jay Gould and his wife who was Helen Margaret Kelly have separated and it is said Mrs. Gould has brought action looking for a legal separation. Jealousy on the part of Mr. Gould, due, it is said, to the homage paid Mrs. Gould, who is a beautiful woman, by other men.\\" In 1909 he was sued by vaudeville dancer Bessie De Voie for breach of promise, and his love letters to her were published as part of the scandal. The case was settled in late 1910, when Gould paid De Voie $10,000.\\"Gould Paid Dancer $10,000 as Balm\\" The Daily Record (November 3, 1910): 8. via Newspapers.com\\"Frank Gould Denies Promise\\" Pittston Gazette (December 28, 1909): 1. via Newspapers.com\\"Gould Love Notes\\" The Courier-News (December 29, 1909): 6. via Newspapers.com Gould's married his second wife, Edith Kelly, in 1910, divorcing in 1919.

He was briefly a member of the James‚ÄìYounger Gang, a band of outlaws that also included the infamous Jesse James. Origins He was the 11th child of Henry Washington Younger and Bersheba Leighton Fristoe's 14 children and their fifth son, the fourth to survive into adulthood. In July 1862, his father was shot and killed while on a business trip to Kansas City by a detachment of Union militiamen. As a result of this killing, several of John's brothers joined Quantrill's Raiders, but John and his younger brother Bob were too young to join so they stayed at home to look after their mother and sisters. Killing of Gillcreas In January 1866, Bob and John took their mother to Independence, Missouri, to purchase winter supplies. Recognizing the family from his military days an ex-soldier named Gillcreas The story of Cole Younger by himself: being an autobiography of the Missouri ...By Cole Younger came up to the wagon and made some comments about Cole. John told him to be quiet and the soldier slapped him around the face with a frozen fish. John got out his brother's pistol (Cole's that they had taken to be repaired) and shot him between the eyes. After an examination of the body it was revealed the soldier was carrying a heavy slingshot that still was tied to his wrist, so the killing was ruled as self-defense. Texas and Missouri The Youngers headed to Texas for a peaceful life until illness fell on Bersheba so the boys (with the exception of Cole) took her back to Missouri to die. As soon as they arrived they were harassed, Bob was knocked unconscious, and John was hung four times,James Buel, The Boarder Outlaws: An Authentic and Thrilling History of the Most Noted Bandits of Ancient or Modern Times, Createspace Independent Publishing Platform, 2017 and the fourth time they hung him the rope dug deep into his flesh.James Buel, The Boarder Outlaws: An Authentic and Thrilling History of the Most Noted Bandits of Ancient or Modern Times, Createspace Independent Publishing Platform, 2017 They cut him down and hacked at the body with knives.James Buel, The Boarder Outlaws: An Authentic and Thrilling History of the Most Noted Bandits of Ancient or Modern Times, Createspace Independent Publishing Platform, 2017 He survived. Witnessing this was too much for Bersheba and she died on June 6, 1870, her 54th birthday. After Bersheba's funeral John and Bob met up with Jim and, because it was not safe to stay in one place, they often moved between Missouri and Texas. On January 20, 1871, he shot and killed two Texas deputy sheriffs.Deputy Sheriff James McMahan and Deputy Sheriff Charles P. Nichols, Dallas County Sheriff's Department James‚ÄìYounger Gang In 1873 Jim, John and Bob Younger joined the James‚ÄìYounger Gang. Death Civil Works Administration marker: \\"A battle between the Youngers and detectives occurred here. Mar.17.1874. Killed - John Younger, E.B. Daniels and Capt. Lull C.W.A. 1934\\" On March 17, 1874, Jim and John were headed to some friends in Roscoe, Missouri. Three men, local deputy sheriff Edward Daniels and two Pinkerton detectives asked them for directions. Suspecting that they were detectives Jim and John ambushed them. One of the agents fled. While interviewing the remaining two, the detective, Andrew Hamlit aka Louis Lull, drew a hidden pistol and shot John through the neck. Jim killed Deputy Daniels,Deputy Sheriff Edwin P Daniels, St Clair County Sheriff's Department while John pursued Lull on horseback to nearby woods, fatally wounding him in the chest. Emerging from the woods still on horseback, as Jim ran towards him, John swayed and fell dead. Jim buried him by the roadside to avoid the law digging him up. Later he removed his body to bury him in an unmarked grave in the cemetery. Louis Lull died three days later.Fair play., May 21, 1874, Image 1 col 2 John Younger is buried in the Yeater-Cleveland Cemetery in St. Clair County, Missouri, about 4‚Äì5 miles NW of Oceola, MO.

She was a core member of the Budapest School philosophical forum in the 1960s and later taught political theory for 25 years at the New School for Social Research in New York City. She lived, wrote and lectured in Budapest. Early life and political development √Ågnes Heller was born on May 12, 1929 to P√°l Heller and Ang√©la \\"Angyalka\\" Ligeti. They were a middle-class Jewish family. During World War II her father used his legal training and knowledge of German to help people get together the necessary paperwork to emigrate from Nazi Europe. In 1944, Heller's father was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp where he died before the war ended. Heller and her mother managed to avoid deportation. With regard to the influence of the Holocaust on her work, Heller said: :I was always interested in the question: How could this possibly happen? How can I understand this? And this experience of the holocaust was joined with my experience in the totalitarian regime. This brought up very similar questions in my soul-search and world investigation: how could this happen? How could people do things like this? So I had to find out what morality is all about, what is the nature of good and evil, what can I do about crime, what can I figure out about the sources of morality and evil? That was the first inquiry. The other inquiry was a social question: what kind of world can produce this? What kind of world allows such things to happen? What is modernity all about? Can we expect redemption?Interview with Csaba Polony, Left Curve Journal In 1947, Heller began to study physics and chemistry at the University of Budapest. She changed her focus to philosophy, however, when her boyfriend at the time urged her to listen to the lecture of the philosopher Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, on the intersections of philosophy and culture. She was immediately taken by how much his lecture addressed her concerns and interests in how to live in the modern world, especially after the experience of World War II and the Holocaust. Heller joined the Communist Party that year, 1947, while at a Zionist work camp'We lived in community, we felt we belonged together. We needed neither money nor the rich ... I didn't like the rich, today I am ashamed of it. I abominated the black market dealers, the dollar speculators, the men of rapacity and greed. No problem! I'd stay loyal for ever to the poor. So, crazy chick that I was, I joined the Communist party to be with the poor'. Cited Eric Hobsbawm, Interesting Times,,2002 p.137 and began to develop her interest in Marxism. However, she felt that the Party was stifling the ability of its adherents to think freely due to its adherence to democratic centralism . She was expelled from it for the first time in 1949, the year that M√°ty√°s R√°kosi came into power and ushered in the years of Stalinist rule. Scientific work =Early career in Hungary= After 1953 and the installation of Imre Nagy as Prime Minister, Heller was able to safely undertake her doctoral studies under the supervision of Luk√°cs, and in 1955 she began to teach at the University of Budapest. =From the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 to the Prague Spring of 1968= The 1956 Hungarian Revolution was the most important political event of her life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist critical theory as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. Heller saw the uprising as confirming her ideas that what Marx really means for the people is to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life. Luk√°cs, Heller and other critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and socialism needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the Soviet Union in Hungary's future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of J√°nos K√°d√°r: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Luk√°cs as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the Hungarian Academy as a researcher (Tormey 4‚Äì18) (Grumley 5‚Äì15). From 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the \\"Budapest School\\", a philosophical forum that was formed by Luk√°cs to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of practiced and theoretical socialism. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband Ferenc Feh√©r, Gy√∂rgy M√°rkus, Mih√°ly Vajda and some other scholars with the looser connection to the school (such as Andr√°s Heged√ºs, Istv√°n E√∂rsi, J√°nos Kis and Gy√∂rgy Bence). Heller's work from this period, concentrated on themes such as what Marx means to be the character of modern societies; liberation theory as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from \\"the bottom up,\\" and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of \\"everyday life\\". =Career in Hungary after the Prague Spring= Until the events of the 1968 Prague Spring, the Budapest School remained supportive of reformist attitudes towards socialism. After the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces and the crushing of dissent, however, the School and Heller came to believe that the Eastern European regimes were entirely corrupted and that reformist theory was apologist. Heller explains in her interview with Polony that: :the regime just could not tolerate any other opinion; that is what a totalitarian regime is. But a totalitarian regime cannot totalize entirely, it cannot dismiss pluralism; pluralism exists in the modern world, but it can outlaw pluralism. To outlaw pluralism means that the Party decided which kind of dissenting opinion was allowed. That is, you could not write something without it being allowed by the Party. But we had started to write and think independently and that was such a tremendous challenge against the way the whole system worked. They could not possibly tolerate not playing by the rules of the game. And we did not play by the rules of the game. This view was completely incompatible with Kadar's view of Hungary's political future after the Revolution of 1956. According to an interview with Heller in 2010 in the German newspaper Jungle World, she thought that political and criminal processes after 1956 were antisemitic. After Luk√°cs died in 1971, the School's members were victims of political persecution, were made unemployed through their dismissal from their university jobs, and were subjected to official surveillance and general harassment. Rather than remain as dissidents, Heller and her husband the philosopher Ferenc Feh√©r, along with many other members of the core group of the School, chose exile in Australia in 1977. =Career abroad= Heller and Feh√©r encountered what they regarded as the sterility of local culture and lived in relative suburban obscurity close to La Trobe University in Melbourne, and they assisted in the transformation of Thesis Eleven from a labourist journal to a leading Australian journal of social theory before its subsequent conversion to \\"American civilization\\" (Tormey 4‚Äì18)(Grumley 5‚Äì15). As described by Tormey, Heller's mature thought during this time period was based on the tenets that can be attributed to her personal history and experience as a member of the Budapest School, focusing on the stress on the individual as agent; the hostility to the justification of the state of affairs by reference to non-moral or non-ethical criteria; the belief in \\"human substance\\" as the origin of everything that is good or worthwhile; and the hostility to forms of theorizing and political practice that deny equality, rationality and self-determination in the name of \\"our\\" interests and needs, however defined. Heller and Feh√©r left Australia in 1986 to take up positions in The New School in New York City, where Heller held the position of Hannah Arendt Professor of Philosophy in the Graduate Studies Program. Her contribution to the field of philosophy was recognized by the many awards that she received (such as the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Philosophy, Bremen, 1995) and the Szechenyi National Prize in Hungary, 1995 and the various academic societies that she served on, including the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 2006 she visited China for a week for the first time. Heller researched and wrote prolifically on ethics, Shakespeare, aesthetics, political theory, modernity, and the role of Central Europe in historical events. From 1990, Heller was more interested in the issues of aesthetics in The Concept of The Beautiful (1998), Time Is Out of Joint (2002), and Immortal Comedy (2005). In 2006, she was the recipient of the Sonning Prize, in 2010 she received the Goethe Medal. In 2010, Heller, with 26 other well known and successful Hungarian women, joined the campaign for a referendum for a female quota in the Hungarian legislature.N≈ëi kv√≥ta: n√©pszavaz√°ssal √©s meztelen f√©rfiakkal pr√≥b√°lkoznak, N√©pszabads√°g, 5 November 2010. Heller published internationally renowned works, including republications of her previous works in English, all of which are internationally revered by scholars such as Lydia Goehr (on Heller's The Concept of the Beautiful), Richard Wolin (on Heller's republication of A Theory of Feelings), Dmitri Nikulin (on comedy and ethics), John Grumley (whose own work focuses on Heller in Agnes Heller: A Moralist in the Vortex of History), John Rundell (on Heller's aesthetics and theory of modernity), Preben Kaarsholm (on Heller's A Short History of My Philosophy), among others. Heller was Professor Emeritus at the New School for Social Research in New York. She worked actively both academically and politically around the globe. She spoke at the Imre Kert√©sz College in Jena, Germany together with Polish sociologist, Zygmunt Bauman , at the T√ºbingen Book Fair in Germany speaking together with Former German Justice Minister, Herta D√§ubler-Gmelin, , and other venues worldwide. Personal life Heller married fellow philosopher Istv√°n Hermann in 1949. Their only daughter, Zsuzsanna \\"Zsuzsa\\" Hermann, was born on 1 October 1952. After their divorce in 1962, Heller married Ferenc Feh√©r in 1963, also a member of Luk√°cs' circle. Heller and Feh√©r had a son, Gy√∂rgy Feh√©r (1964). Ferenc Feh√©r died in 1994. √Ågnes Heller mentions that prominent Hungarian violinist Leopold Auer was related to her family on her mother's side. Heller is second-cousin of 20th century contemporary composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. While going for a swim in Lake Balaton on 19 July 2019, Heller drowned at Balatonalm√°di.

Biography =Early life= Charles Bennett was born in a disused railway carriage in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, England, the son of Lilian Langrishe Bennett (1863‚Äì1930), an actress and artist. Bennett's mother told him his father was Charles Bennett, a civil engineer killed in a boiler explosion, though he thought it was actor Kyrle Bellew (1855‚Äì1911). Bennett had an elder brother, Frederick (known as Eric), and a younger brother, Vere. His father is recorded in his baptismal register as Frederick Bennett, engineer. The film historian John Belton has asserted that Bennett's father died when he was four. In the 1911 census, Lilian Bennett recorded herself as a widow, and an artist. Bennett was mostly educated at home, but also briefly at St Mark's College, Chelsea. =Actor= Bennett was a child actor, appearing in Max Reinhart's production of The Miracle at Olympia Theatre in 1911. He played child roles in stage productions of Alice in Wonderland (1913), Goody Two Shoes (1913), Drake (1914) and The Marriage Market (1915), and toured in productions all over England. He had a role in the film John Halifax, Gentleman (1915) as the young John Halifax; the older Halifax was Fred Paul. The performance was not particularly well received and Bennett became an extra and assistant to Adrian Brunel. He continued to appear in stage in productions of The Speckled Band (1916), King Lear (1916) with Sir Herbert Tree and Raffles (1917). In 1917 he enlisted in the army and served with the Royal Fusiliers. Most of his war service was spent on the Somme, where he saw action. He was awarded the Military Medal and ended the war with the rank of lieutenant. He was invalided out due to a gas attack and left the army in 1919. Bennett resumed his acting career, playing with the Brewster's Millions company (1920), then the Compton Comedy Company, the Lena Ashwell Players, the Gertrude Elliott Touring Company, and the Henry Baynton Company (for whom he appeared in Antony and Cleopatra and A Midsummer Night's Dream).In 1923 he joined the Alexander Marsh Shakespearean company, touring throughout England. =Playwright= In 1925 Bennett joined the Ben Greet Repertory, which performed in Paris from 1925 to 1926. During this time, while acting in the evenings he wrote his first three full-length plays: The Return, based on his war service, Blackmail and The Last Hour. In December 1926 Bennett played Theseus in a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at London's Winter Garden Theatre. In April 1927 he was in a production of Othello at the Apollo Theatre alongside John Gielgud, Robert Loraine and Gertrude Elliott. In May 1927 Bennett appeared in a production of his own play The Return, which he also directed. Peggy Ashcroft was in the cast. In December 1927 he appeared in Loraine's production of Cyrano de Bergerac. Bennett had the biggest success of his career to date when Al Woods decided to finance a production of Blackmail in 1928, produced by Raymond Massey and starring Tallulah Bankhead. The play was not well received at first, but had a hugely successful run on tour. The play was seen by Alfred Hitchcock who arranged for British International Pictures to buy the film rights and adapted Bennett's play into a script, with Benn Levy doing the dialogue. His film of Blackmail (1929) is generally credited as the first British sound film, and was a huge commercial success. Bennett's play The Last Hour debuted on London stage in December 1928 and was a popular hit in London. The Last Hour (1930) was turned into a movie directed by Walter Forde, the first \\"talkie\\" for Nettleford Studios. Bennett's fourth play was The Danger Line (1929), based on Hazel May Marshall's story Ten Minutes to Twelve. He also wrote a one act play After Midnight (1929). =Early Screenplays= The success of Blackmail led to British International offering him a contract in September 1931 to deliver three film stories a year for two years. He was reunited with Alfred Hitchcock and they collaborated on a story for Bulldog Drummond, to be called Bulldog Drummond's Baby. However Hitchcock then directed some films which flopped and BIP chose not to proceed with the project. While at BIP he did unfilmed stories for Death on the Footplate, The Parrot Whistles, High Speed, Love My Dog and Fireman Save My Child. Bennett provided the story for a number of low- budget movies for George King who he later called the \\"world's worst director\\":Bennett p 105 Number, Please (1931); Deadlock (1931), which was a big hit; Midnight (1931), the latter based on his play; and Two Way Street (1932). Bennett wrote and directed the play Sensation (1931), a melodrama, but it was not a success, although it was adapted into a film. He followed it with another play Big Business (1932), which Bennett also directed and appeared in alongside his then-wife Maggie. But by now he had given up acting to focus on writing. Bennett wrote a short film, Partners Please (1932), and did an early film for John Paddy Carstairs, Paris Plane (1933). Bennett wrote Mannequin (1933); The House of Trent (1933); Matinee Idol (1933) for King; Hawley's of High Street (1933), a rare comedy for Bennett; The Secret of the Loch (1934), the first film shot on location in Scotland; Warn London (1934); an adaptation of his play Big Business (1934); and Gay Love (1934). A number of these films were written in collaboration with publicist and story writer Billie Bristow; she and Bennett would work on eight films together in all. In 1934 he wrote the play Heart's Desire which he later regarded as the best play he wrote and the only one he loved but it was never produced. =Hitchcock= Hitchcock moved over to Gaumont British where he got Michael Balcon interested in Bulldog Drummond's Baby. It was eventually filmed as The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), which was a significant success. After doing Night Mail (1935) with Bristow, Bennett wrote The 39 Steps (1935) for Hitchcock, a film which soon established itself as a classic; Bennett said he was responsible for most of the film's construction, but paid tribute to the contribution of Ian Hay, who did dialogue. Bennett was now in much demand. He wrote The Clairvoyant (1935) with Claude Rains and Fay Wray; King of the Damned (1935), written with Sidney Gilliat; All at Sea (1936); Blue Smoke (1935). He did two films for Hitchcock, Secret Agent (1936) (based on Somerset Maugham's Ashenden) and Sabotage (1936). In January 1936 his play Page From a Diary, starring Greer Garson and Ernst Deutsch, had a short run at the Garrick Theatre in London. Bennett was one of several writers on King Solomon's Mines (1937) then he went back to Hitchcock for Young and Innocent (1937). =Hollywood= Bennett's work with Hitchcock had made him perhaps the most highly regarded screenwriter in England (one paper called him \\"Britain's best known blood curdler\\") and attracted the attention of Hollywood. In 1937 he accepted a contract with Universal Studios at $1,500 a week.McGilligan p 33 Universal loaned himself out to Sam Goldwyn, and did some uncredited writing on The Adventures of Marco Polo (1938) and The Real Glory (1939), then worked on Universal's Good Girls Go to Paris (1939) and Hidden Power (1939). After six months Universal dropped Bennett's contract. His agent Myron Selznick got Bennett a job with Myron's brother David. Bennett got his first Hollywood credited on the comedy The Young in Heart (1938); he did the construction and Paul Osborne the dialogue. Bennett then signed a contract to MGM where he worked on Cause for Alarm, an adaptation of an Eric Ambler novel which ended up not being made, and Balalaika (1939), a Nelson Eddy musical. He wrote a short novel, War in His Pocket, which was published in 1939. Hitchcock moved to the US and hired Bennett to do some work on Foreign Correspondent (1940). Bennett was nominated for an Oscar for Best Script. =Cecil B. De Mille= Bennett worked on They Dare Not Love (1941) at Columbia and did uncredited work on Lucky Legs (1942). He was hired by Cecil B. De Mille to work on the script construction of Reap the Wild Wind (1942), which was a huge hit. Bennett went to RKO to write Joan of Paris (1942), which was one of his favourite films. At that studio he wrote the unproduced Challenge to the Night and was one of many writers on Forever and a Day (1943). He also made some uncredited contributions to the script of Saboteur (1942). During war he claims to have done undercover work for Allied intelligence. De Mille used Bennett again on The Story of Dr. Wassell (1944), once more focusing on construction while Alan Le May did the dialogue. Another script Bennett did for De Mulle, Rurales, about the Mexican Revolution, was never made. In 1944 Bennett returned to London to write propaganda films for the British Ministry of Information. He continued to write feature films as well, earning $15,000 from Edward Small for an early draft of Lorna Doone, and an adaptation of the Madeleine Smith story for Two Cities Films to star Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, at a fee of ¬£4,000. He was contracted to direct the latter. Two Cities contracted Bennett to write Miracle of Peille. After the war, Bennett returned to Hollywood and wrote Unconquered (1947) for De Mille. Olivier and Leigh pulled out of the Madeleine Smith project, so Bennett went to Universal to work on Ivy (1947), a thriller for Sam Wood and Joan Fontaine. =Director= Bennett was going to direct Laraine Day in The Trial of Madeleine Smith but those plans were interrupted when David Lean decided to make Madeleine. Instead he worked on the scripts for The Sign of the Ram (1948) for John Sturges and Black Magic (1948) for Edward Small. He attempted to remake Blackmail but was unsuccessful. Bennett finally made his directorial debut in Madness of the Heart (1949) with Margaret Lockwood. He continued to write: the unproduced Bangkok for Robert North, The Search for the Holy Grail for De Mille and a film for Rank, The Moneyman. He was credited on the script for Where Danger Lives (1950), where he worked with Irwin Allen for the first time. He also write Kind Lady (1951), and The Green Glove (1952), then got another chance to direct with No Escape (1953), a film noir. Bennett worked on the script for Dangerous Mission (1954) where he worked with Allen again. =Television= Bennett began writing for TV, doing such shows as The Ford Television Theatre, Climax! (where he did the first screen adaptation of a James Bond novel, Casino Royale), Schlitz Playhouse, Fireside Theatre, Cavalcade of America, The Count of Monte Cristo, Conflict, The Christophers, Lux Video Theatre and The New Adventures of Charlie Chan. Some of these he also directed and he produced Charlie Chan. =Irwin Allen= Bennett was reunited with Allen on The Story of Mankind (1957). He wrote Night of the Demon (1957) in England, which he had hoped to direct himself; it became a cult success. He then did a series of films for Allen: The Big Circus (1959), The Lost World (1960), Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961), and Five Weeks in a Balloon (1962). Bennett also wrote for The Dick Powell Show and did War- Gods of the Deep (1965) for AIP. In the late 1960s Bennett focused on TV series such as The Wild Wild West, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and Land of the Giants for Allen. =Later career= Bennett had no produced credits from the 1970s onwards. \\"It was so frustrating, because in many ways I felt my writing had gotten even better\\", he said. \\"But at my age, no one wanted to hire me... know, I hate all the talk of this being a young man's industry. I hate it! Not because I'm an old man. But because I hate the notion that you must be young to be hot.\\" Bennett continued to write films, plays, treatments and TV series, though none were produced. He wrote a novel, Fox on the Run which was published in 1987. In 1990 Bennett was hired to write a remake of Blackmail. The film was never made. Personal life Bennett's brother Eric was killed in World War I in 1915. His other brother, Vere, hanged himself in 1928. He was twice married. First, in 1930, to the actress Faith Bennett. They were divorced in 1941, and in 1947 Bennett married Betty Jo Riley, who predeceased him. They had a son, John Charles Bennett. Bennett died in Los Angeles in 1995.

Educated at the University of Toulouse and the Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique (ENSAE) in Paris, he was awarded the Ph.D. in Economics by Harvard University in 1975. Laffont taught at the √âcole Polytechnique (1975‚Äì1987), and was Professor of Economics at Ecole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (1980‚Äì2004) and at the University of Toulouse I (1991‚Äì2001). In 1991, he founded Toulouse's Industrial Economics Institute (Institut D'Economie Industrielle, IDEI) which has become one of the most prominent European research centres in economics. From 2001 until his death, he was the inaugural holder of the University of Southern California's John Elliott Chair in Economics. Over the course of his career, he wrote 17 books and more than 200 articles. Had he lived, he might well have shared the 2014 Nobel Prize for Economics awarded to his colleague and collaborator Jean Tirole.  Contribution to economics  Laffont made pioneering contributions in microeconomics, in particular, public economics, development economics, and the theory of imperfect information, incentives, and regulation. His 1993 book A Theory of Incentives in Procurement and Regulation, written with Jean Tirole, is a fundamental reference in the economics of the public sector and the theory of regulation. In 2002, he published (with David Martimort) The Theory of Incentives: the Principal-Agent Model, a treatise on the economics of information and incentives. His last book, Regulation and Development, discussed policies for improving the economies of less developed countries.

Alexander Pearce (1790 ‚Äì 19 July 1824) was an Irish convict who was transported to the penal colony in Van Diemen's Land (the modern day state of Tasmania), Australia for seven years for theft. He escaped from prison several times. During one of these escapes he allegedly became a cannibal, murdering his companions one by one. In another escape, with one companion, he allegedly killed him and ate him in pieces. He was eventually captured and was hanged in Hobart for murder, and later dissected. Early life Pearce was born in County Monaghan, Ireland.Convict Indent, CON13/1/2 p19, Tasmanian Archives A Roman Catholic farm labourer, he was sentenced at Armagh in 1819 to penal transportation to Van Diemen's Land for \\"the theft of six pairs of shoes\\".The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce Anne-Marie Marquess, culturenorthernireland.org. Retrieved 2008-11-02. He continued to commit various petty offences whilst in the penal colony in Van Diemen's Land, from which he soon escaped. The 18 May 1822 edition of the Hobart Town Gazette reported this escape and advertised a ¬£10 reward for his recapture. When caught, he was charged with absconding and forging an order, a serious crime. For this he received a second sentence of transportation, this time to the new secondary penal establishment at Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbour. Escape and cannibalism Copy of the death sentence pronounced on Alexander Pearce On 20 September 1822, Pearce along with seven other convicts of Macquarie Harbour Penal Station: Alexander Dalton, Thomas Bodenham, William Kennerly, Matthew Travers, Edward Brown, Robert Greenhill and John Mather escaped while working on the eastern side of the harbour. Greenhill, who had the axe, appointed himself leader, supported by his friend Travers, with whom he had been sent to Macquarie Harbour for stealing businessman Anthony Fenn Kemp's schooner in an attempt to escape. About 15 days into the journey, the men were starving and drew lots to see who would be killed for food. Thomas Bodenham (or perhaps Alexander Dalton: see below) drew the short straw and Greenhill despatched him with an axe. At this point three of the company ‚Äì Dalton, Kennerly and Brown ‚Äì took fright and decamped. Kennerly and Brown reached Macquarie Harbour, but Dalton seemed to have died of exhaustion. That left Greenhill, Travers, John Mather and Alexander Pearce. With Greenhill and Travers acting as a team, it would be Mather's or Pearce's turn next. Pearce seems to have sided with Greenhill and Travers at this point, and Mather was the next victim. It was then that Pearce had some luck: Travers was bitten on the foot by a snake. Greenhill insisted they carry him for five days, but when it became clear he would not recover, killed him.Sprod, Dan, Alexander Pearce of Macquarie Harbour, Cat & Fiddle Press, Hobart 1977 After that, it was a cat-and-mouse game. Greenhill had the axe, but they were both starving, and they had to sleep. In the end it was Pearce who prevailed. He grabbed the axe, killed Greenhill and dined on his body. He later raided an Aboriginal campsite and stole more food. When he saw sheep, he knew he had reached the settled districts. He was lucky again, as the shepherd who came upon him eating a lamb was an old friend. Pearce was inducted into a sheep-stealing ring, and was eventually picked up with William Davis and Ralph Churton, who were both hanged for bushranging and escaping from a military escort. In total, Pearce had been on the run for 113 days, a little less than half of which was spent in the wilderness. Locked up in Hobart, Pearce made a confession to the Rev. Robert Knopwood, the magistrate and chaplain. However, Knopwood did not believe the cannibalism story and was convinced the others were still living as bushrangers. He sent Pearce back to Macquarie Harbour. There are inconsistencies in Pearce's story. He made three confessions ‚Äì the Knopwood confession; a confession to Lt. Cuthbertson, Commandant of Macquarie Harbour when he was in hospital after the second escape (in this version, Dalton is the first victim); and a confession to Father Phillip Connolly, the colony's Catholic priest, the night before his execution ‚Äì and some of the details differed. What is incontrovertible is that eight men went into the bush at Macquarie Harbour, and only three came out; and of the four men alive when Dalton, Kennerly and Brown decamped, only one survived. Within a year, Pearce escaped a second time, joined by a young convict named Thomas Cox. Pearce was captured within ten days and taken to the Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land in Hobart, where he was tried and convicted of murdering and cannibalising Thomas Cox. Observers noted Pearce did not look like a cannibal. He was only in height, which was under average for that time, but had a strong wiry frame. He did not seem to be someone who was \\"laden with the weight of human blood, and believed to have banqueted on human flesh\\" as the Hobart Town Gazette wrote on 25 June 1824. His captors had found parts of Cox's body in Pearce's pockets, even though he still had food left, and his guilt was beyond doubt this time. Pearce confessed he had killed Cox because when they reached King's River, he discovered that Cox could not swim. Pearce was the first felon to be executed by the new Supreme Court and the first confessed cannibal to pass through the Tasmanian court system. Alexander Pearce was hanged at the Hobart Town Gaol at 9am on 19 July 1824, after receiving the last rites from Father Connolly.The Hobart Town Gazette, Friday 23 July 1824.

Mill submitted the finished manuscript of their collaborative work On Liberty (1859) soon after her untimely death in late 1858, and then continued work on The Subjection of Women until its completion in 1861. At the time of its publication, the essay's argument for equality between the sexes was an affront to European conventional norms regarding the status of men and women. In his Autobiography, Mill describes his indebtedness to his wife, and his daughter Helen Taylor for the creation of The Subjection of Women: While scholars generally agree that John Stuart Mill was the sole author, it is also noted that some of the arguments are similar to Harriet Taylor Mill's essay The Enfranchisement of Women, which was published in 1851. Mill was convinced that the moral and intellectual advancement of humankind would result in greater happiness for everybody. He asserted that the higher pleasures of the intellect yielded far greater happiness than the lower pleasure of the senses. He conceived of human beings as morally and intellectually capable of being educated and civilised. Mill believed everyone should have the right to vote, with the only exceptions being barbarians and uneducated people. Mill argues that people should be able to vote to defend their own rights and to learn to stand on their two feet, morally and intellectually. This argument is applied to both men and women. Mill often used his position as a member of Parliament to demand the vote for women, a controversial position for the time. In Mill's time a woman was generally subject to the whims of her husband or father due to social norms which said women were both physically and mentally less able than men and therefore needed to be \\"taken care of.\\" Contributing to this view were both hierarchical religious views of men and women within the family and social theories based on biological determinism. The archetype of the ideal woman as mother, wife and homemaker was a powerful idea in 19th century society. At the time of writing, Mill recognized that he was going against the common views of society and was aware that he would be forced to back up his claims persistently. Mill argued that the inequality of women was a relic from the past, when \\"might was right,\\"\\"To yield to force is an act of necessity, not of will; it is at best an act of prudence. In what sense can it be a moral duty ... once might is made to be right, cause and effect are reversed, and every force which overcomes another force inherits the right which belonged to the vanquished. As soon as man can obey with impunity, his disobedience becomes legitimate; and the strongest is always right, the only problem is how to become the strongest. But what can be the validity of a right which perishes with the force on which it rests? If force compels obedience, there is no need to invoke duty to obey, and if force ceases to compel obedience, there is no longer any obligation. Thus the word 'right' adds nothing to what is said by 'force'; it is meaningless. 'Obey those in power.' If this means 'yield to force' the precept is sound, but superfluous; it will never, I suggest, be violated. ... If I am held up by a robber at the edge of a wood, force compels me to hand over my purse. But if I could somehow contrive to keep the purse from him, would I still be obliged in conscience to surrender it? After all, the pistol in the robber's hand is undoubtedly a power.\\" The Social Contract, Book I, Chapter 3: The Right of the Strongest (Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1762). but it had no place in the modern world.John Stuart Mill, On the Subjection of Women, Chapter I\\"... [T]he law of the strongest seems to be entirely abandoned as the regulating principle of the world's affairs: nobody professes it, and, as regards most of the relations between human beings, nobody is permitted to practice it. On the Subjection of Women, Chapter I (John Stuart Mill, 1869). Mill saw that having effectively half the human race unable to contribute to society outside of the home as a hindrance to human development.  Arguments  Mill attacks the argument that women are naturally worse at some things than men and should, therefore, be discouraged or forbidden from doing them. He says that we simply don't know what women are capable of, because we have never let them try ‚Äì one cannot make an authoritative statement without evidence. We can't stop women from trying things because they might not be able to do them. An argument based on speculative physiology is just that, speculation. In this, men are basically contradicting themselves because they say women cannot do an activity and want to stop them from doing it. Here Mill suggests that men are basically admitting that women are capable of doing the activity, but that men do not want them to do so. Whether women can do them or not must be found out in practice. In reality, we don't know what women's nature is, because it is so wrapped up in how they have been raised. Mill suggests we should test out what women can and can't do ‚Äì experiment. Women are brought up to act as if they were weak, emotional, docile ‚Äì a traditional prejudice. If we tried equality, we would see that there were benefits for individual women. They would be free of the unhappiness of being told what to do by men. And there would be benefits for society at large ‚Äì it would double the mass of mental faculties available for the higher service of humanity. The ideas and potential of half the population would be liberated, producing a great effect on human development. Mill's essay is clearly utilitarian in nature on three counts: The immediate greater good,The family, justly constituted, would be the real school of the virtues of freedom. The Subjection of Women, Chapter II the enrichment of society,\\"The moral training of mankind will never be adapted to the adapted to the conditions of the life for which all other human progress is a preparation, until they practice in the family the same moral rule which is adapted to the normal constitution of human society.\\" On the Subjection of Women, Chapter I (John Stuart Mill, 1869) and individual development. If society really wanted to discover what is truly natural in gender relations, Mill argued, it should establish a free market for all of the services women perform, ensuring a fair economic return for their contributions to the general welfare. Only then would their practical choices be likely to reflect their genuine interests and abilities. Mill felt that the emancipation and education of women would have positive benefits for men also. The stimulus of female competition and companionship of equally educated persons would result in the greater intellectual development of all. He stressed the insidious effects of the constant companionship of an uneducated wife or husband. Mill felt that men and women married to follow customs and that the relation between them was a purely domestic one. By emancipating women, Mill believed, they would be better able to connect on an intellectual level with their husbands, thereby improving relationships. Mill attacks marriage laws, which he likens to the slavery of women, \\"there remain no legal slaves, save the mistress of every house.\\" He alludes to the subjection of women becoming redundant as slavery did before it. He also argues for the need for reforms of marriage legislation whereby it is reduced to a business agreement, placing no restrictions on either party. Among these proposals are the changing of inheritance laws to allow women to keep their own property, and allowing women to work outside the home, gaining independent financial stability. Again the issue of women's suffrage is raised. Women make up half of the population, thus they also have a right to a vote since political policies affect women too. He theorises that most men will vote for those MPs who will subordinate women, therefore women must be allowed to vote to protect their own interests. Mill felt that even in societies as unequal as England and Europe that one could already find evidence that when given a chance women could excel. He pointed to such English queens as Elizabeth I, or Victoria, or the French patriot, Joan of Arc. If given the chance women would excel in other arenas and they should be given the opportunity to try. Mill was not just a theorist; he actively campaigned for women's rights as an MP and was the president of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. Conclusions The way Mill interpreted subjects over time changed. For many years Mill was seen as an inconsistent philosopher, writing on a number of separate issues. Consistency in his approach is based on utilitarianism, and the good of society. =Utilitarianism= Nothing should be ruled out because it is just \\"wrong\\" or because no one has done it in the past. When we are considering our policies, we should seek the greatest happiness of the greatest number. This leads to attacks on conventional views. If you wish to make something illegal, you need to prove what harm is being done. Individuals know their own interests best. =Progress of society= The greatest good is understood in a very broad sense to be the moral and intellectual developments of society. Different societies are at different stages of development or civilisation. Different solutions may be required for them. What matters is how we encourage them to advance further. We can say the same for individuals. Mill has a quite specific idea of individual progress: (1) employing higher faculties; (2) moral development, with people placing narrow self-interest behind them. =Individual self-reliance= We are independent, capable of change and of being rational. Individual liberty provides the best route to moral development. As we develop, we are able to govern ourselves, make our own decisions, and not to be dependent on what anyone else tells us to do. Democracy is a form of self-dependence. This means: # Personal Liberty As long as we do not harm others, we should be able to express our own natures, and experiment with our lives # Liberty to Govern our own Affairs Civilized people are increasingly able to make their own decisions, and protect their own rights. Representative government is also a useful way of getting us to think about the common good. # Liberty for women as well as men All of Mill's arguments apply to both men and women. Previous ideas about the different natures of men and women have never been properly tested. Women can participate in determining their own affairs too.

They exist in many countries and are often affiliated with either the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (through a national body) or the Campus Crusade for Christ. Many Christian unions are one of the societies affiliated to their universities' students' union. As a broader term, Christian union may refer to any Christian student society, such as SCM and Fusion groups. In the United Kingdom Since their split from the Student Christian Movement in the early twentieth century, most Christian Unions in the United Kingdom are affiliated to the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship (UCCF). Some UK Christian Unions have had difficult relationships with the students' union due to their policy of allowing leaders to choose their successors in order, they argue, to ensure a Christian leadership (students' unions often require democratic processes be followed), opinions on issues such as homosexuality, and the requirement that leaders affirm a fixed Doctrinal Basis. Many, but not all, CUs require all members to sign this Doctrinal Basis. The latter includes doctrinal statements that go beyond the historic ecumenical creeds, e.g. recognising the Bible as the sole authority, and belief in penal substitution.UCCF: The Christian Unions - Doctrinal Basis A considerable number of Christian students have problems affirming these points, and feel excluded from Christian Unions. This has led to calls for local Christian Unions to change their name to something more specific, e.g. Evangelical Christian Union.United We Stand?

These particular events involve providing a number to students, to which they text a question about God, the bible, or Christianity more generally, and in response two members of the Christian Union deliver a toastie to them and answer their question. While considered unusual by some, this has proven an effective way of communicating with other students for many CUs.

(Although the cavalry link remained part of its defining character, as early as the Battle of Waterloo the RHA was sometimes deployed more along the lines of conventional field artillery, fighting from comparatively fixed positions). The Royal Horse Artillery, currently consists of three regiments, (1 RHA, 3 RHA and 7 RHA) and one ceremonial unit (King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery). Almost all the batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery have served continuously since the French Revolutionary Wars or Napoleonic Wars, except the King's Troop which has existed since 1946 and M Battery which was 'reanimated' in 1993. Horses are still in service for ceremonial purposes but were phased out from operational deployment during the 1930s. History In 1793, in the course of the French Revolutionary Wars, Great Britain and allied European powers declared war on France over French occupation of the Rhine delta and Antwerp, precipitating the Flanders Campaign. Britain remained in conflict with France for almost 22 years, during which time significant progress was achieved in artillery development.Graham C. A. L. DSO psc, Brig Gen The Story of the Royal Regiment of Artillery RA Institution, Woolwich 1939 The first two troops of Horse Artillery (A ‚Äì later entitled \\"The Chestnut Troop\\" ‚Äì and B) were raised in January 1793 at Goodwood, West Sussex, by the Master-General of the Ordnance, the 3rd Duke of Richmond, to provide fire support for the cavalry. They were joined by two more troops in November 1793. Each troop had six 6-pounder guns. Another development was the formation of a headquarters staff providing a channel between the regiment and the Board of Ordnance. Captain John Macleod was the first brigade major and became the first deputy-adjutant-general in 1795. By 1806, eleven troops had been formed, with ten companies of the Royal Irish Artillery incorporated, as the Seventh Battalion, after the union with Ireland in 1801. The Royal Regiment of Artillery was not part of the British Army at this time, but part of the establishment of the Board of Ordnance, with the Master-General its commanding officer; only after the Board's abolition in 1855 did the Artillery become part of the British Army under the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. All RHA personnel were mounted. Included in the establishment were 45 drivers and 187 horses, making it the first self- contained fighting unit of artillery. Initially, there was a clear distinction between the mounted Royal Horse Artillery and the rest of the Royal Artillery, who were dismounted. Whenever horses were needed for the rest of the Artillery (as they routinely were, to move field guns from place to place) they had to be hired along with civilian drivers. This was problematic, so in 1794 a separate Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers was raised (which did not affect the self-contained Royal Horse Artillery, but provided ready teams of draught horses and drivers for the field artillery units). After Waterloo, the Corps of Drivers was disbanded and instead artillerymen were trained as drivers, which gave the field artillery mounted status. (Indeed, when the Royal Artillery split into separate units in 1899, the term 'Mounted Branch' was used to refer collectively to the Royal Horse Artillery and the Royal Field Artillery, while 'Dismounted Branch' referred to the Royal Garrison Artillery.) The Royal Horse Artillery was, however, distinguished from the Field Artillery by (among other things) its speed: the need to keep pace with a cavalry charge was achieved initially by the Horse Artillery using lighter guns than the RFA, and later by their using proportionally more horses. The regiment wore light cavalry uniforms of blue with gold lace and red facings. Their overalls were grey with a red stripe and on their heads they wore the distinctive Tarleton helmets.A Waterloo Officers Royal Horse Artillery Tarleton Helmet (illustration) at The Military Gentleman website. Accessed 15 March 2013 If needed, they carried 1796 light-cavalry sabres or their own semi-official RHA 1796P sabre. The RHA has acquitted itself with distinction in the great wars of two centuries, the Napoleonic Wars, the Indian Mutiny, the Crimean War, the Peninsular War, the Anglo-Zulu War, the Boer War, World War I and World War II. In 1859, the term \\"battalion\\" was replaced by \\"brigade\\". (This in turn was replaced by \\"regiment\\" in 1939.) The five Horse Artillery brigades consisted of two batteries each. Between 1899 and 1924, the Royal Artillery was divided, with the creation of the Royal Field Artillery which utilised horse for its medium-calibre guns. When the Territorial Force was created in 1908, artillery units of the old Volunteer Force were converted into foot, horse, and garrison batteries. There were 14 batteries of horse artillery, 12 of which belonged to the RHA, the remaining two being provided by the Honourable Artillery Company. Territorial batteries were of four guns each rather than the six guns of regular batteries. The principal weapon of Territorial RHA units was the Ordnance QF 15 pounder although the Ordnance BLC 15 pounder was issued to some second-line RHA units formed in 1914.Becke, A. F. (1945). History of the Great War: Order of Battle of Divisions: Territorial Force & Mounted Divisions Pt. 2A. London HMSO. At the outbreak of World War I the regular RHA comprised twenty-five batteries, eleven of those serving in India with the Indian Army. They were equipped with the Ordnance QF 13 pounder. In the 1920s, development of trucks and track vehicles brought an end to operational use of horses. By 1927, medium artillery was drawn by tractors instead of heavy draught horses. By 1937, nine field brigades had been mechanised as well as a brigade of RHA. The last battery to be mechanised was K Battery, in 1939. Today, the ceremonial King's Troop alone retains the panache of the mounted batteries. At the onset of World War II, recruits were instructed that \\"the role of the Royal Artilleryman is, as it has ever been, to fight his gun, forgetful of self, to the last round in support of other arms.\\" Current Regiments A Guard of the King's Troop at Horse Guards Parade The King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery at Trooping the Colour, in 2012 The following are current units of the Royal Horse Artillery: * The King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery based at King George VI Lines, Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich * 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery based at Assaye Barracks, Tidworth Camp as self-propelled field artillery * 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery based at Albemarle Barracks, Harlow Hill as light field artillery * 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery based at Merville Barracks, Colchester Garrison as parachute field artillery The Royal Horse Artillery has provided the Queen's Guard on three occasions: *1 RHA ‚Äì January 1979 *7 Para RHA ‚Äì March 1989 *King's Troop ‚Äì April 2007 The King's Troop provides the Queen's Life Guard in Whitehall for three weeks in August each year while the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment goes away for summer training.

She was founding president of the Writers' Club in 1892, and president of the Society of Women Journalists in 1901 to 1903. Early life and education She was born on 13 January 1856 in Trinity Lane, York, was only daughter of Henry Vaughan Palmer, rector of St. Margaret's, York, by his wife Emily Catherine Cowling. Her father had been an officer in the Royal Artillery before taking orders, and came of several generations of soldiers. Her great-great-great-grandmother was Hannah Pritchard. Henrietta was educated at Bootham House School, York.  Career  In 1874, she began her career as a novelist by writing under the pseudonym of 'Violet Whyte' for the Family Herald. Her connection with that journal lasted for ten years, and she contributed to it 42 short stories issued as supplements, besides many long serials. In 1881, appeared Cavalry Life, a collection of regimental sketches, and in 1883 Regimental Legends. Both bore the name of 'John Strange Winter,' a character in one of the tales in the former volume. The publisher refused to bring out the books under a feminine pseudonym. The public assumed the author to be a cavalry officer. She retained the name for literary and business purposes through life. Henrietta Palmer married at Fulford, York, on 26 February 1884, Arthur Stannard, A.M.I.C.E., and they had a son, scriptwriter Eliot Stannard, and three daughters. She settled in London and continued her literary endeavours. In 1885, Booties' Baby: a story of the Scarlet Lancers, the tale that assured her popularity, appeared in the Graphic. Two million copies were sold within ten years of its first publication. Tales of a similar character, with military life for their setting, followed in rapid succession until her death. There are 112 entries to her name in the British Museum Catalogue. She found an admirer of her work in leading art critic John Ruskin and in 1888 visited at his home in Sandgate. Ruskin wrote of 'John Strange Winter' as \\"the author to whom we owe the most finished and faithful rendering ever yet given of the character of the British soldier\\". For some time Ruskin and John Strange Winter constantly corresponded. alt=A man in bright red uniform points a pistol at two men hiding behind bushes. It is accompanied by the text \\"Private Tinker by John Strange Winter\\". In 1891, she started a penny weekly magazine, Golden Gates; in 1892 the title was altered to Winter's Weekly, and in its first issues it launched the career of Nora Vynne. The magazine continued until 1895, but in 1896, the health of her husband and of her youngest daughter made residence at the seaside imperative, and Dieppe became her home until 1901, when she returned to London, retaining a house at Dieppe for summer residence until 1909. She wrote enthusiastic articles about Dieppe which greatly increased its popularity. The municipality presented her with a diamond ring in recognition of her services to the town. Well known in journalistic circles, she was first president of the Writers' Club (1892), and was president of the Society of Women Journalists (1901‚Äì03). Mrs. Stannard died, from complications following an accident, on 13 December 1911 at York House, Hurlingham, Putney. She was cremated and the ashes interred at Woking crematorium. Notwithstanding her many activities, she left only ¬£547. She was the subject of a biography, John Strange Winter: a volume of personal record (1916) by Oliver Bainbridge, with a foreword by General Sir Alfred Turner.

(His name is sometimes given as Peter von Winter.) Winter was born at Mannheim. A child prodigy on the violin, he played in the Mannheim court orchestra. He studied with Antonio Salieri in Vienna. Moving to Munich in 1778, he became director of the court theatre at which point he started to write stage works, at first ballets and melodramas. He became Vice-Kapellmeister in Munich in 1787 and Kapellmeister in 1798, a title he kept for the rest of his life. Of more than thirty operas written by Winter between 1778 and 1820 very few were unsuccessful. His most popular work, Das unterbrochene Opferfest, was produced in 1796 at Vienna, where in 1797-1798 he composed Die Pyramiden von Babylon and Das Labyrinth oder Der Kampf mit den Elementen, both written for him by Emanuel Schikaneder, in continuation of the story of Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te. He returned to Munich in 1798. Five years later he visited London, where he produced La grotta di Calipso in 1803, Il ratto di Proserpina in 1804 (both to libretti by Lorenzo Da Ponte), and Zaira in 1805, with great success. Maometto (1817) is probably his most famous opera, still performed sometimes and it exists in an excellent recording on CD. His last opera, Der S√§nger und der Schneider, was produced in 1820 at Munich, where he died. Besides his dramatic works he composed concertos for wind and orchestra and some sacred music, including 26 masses.

The fortress is accessed by the Kastellet ferry, an electrically powered cable ferry across the channel from Vaxholm town. In 1970, it was used as a movie location for the pirate stronghold in Pippi in the South Seas. A scenic view of the castle may be seen from the car ferry which plies the short distance between Vaxholm and the island Rind√∂. History The fortress was originally constructed by Gustav Vasa in 1548 to defend Stockholm against shipborne attacks from the east. This wooden blockhouse was replaced by a stone tower during Johan III's reign. Most of the current structure dates from 1833‚Äì1863. Its design was inspired by the ideas on fortifications propounded by the French engineers Marc Ren√© Montalbert and Lazare Carnot.Lloyd, E. M. (1887), Vauban, Montalembert, Carnot: Engineer Studies, Chapman and Hall, London (pp. 183‚Äì195) Russian prisoners-of-war were used in part to build the fortress. The stretch of water below the building was formerly the main sea route to Stockholm. Thus, the fortress was strategically situated to defend the city from naval attacks. The Danes attacked it in 1612 and the Russian navy in 1719. Since the mid-19th century, its military importance has ceased. So weak had the fort become that it was said the great Prussian field marshal von Moltke was only ever seen to smile twice ‚Äì once when they told him his mother-in-law was dead and again when he saw Vaxholm Fort.Fire and Stone: The Science of Fortress Warfare 1660‚Äì1860 by Prof. Christopher Duffy.

In the year 1322 in Dalmatia, which had trade connections also as the Republic of Venice, Peter de genere Percal was mentioned. This word Percal, which occurred the first time in a Supreme Court verdict on Latin in 1322 in Dalmatia, derived from the Hebrew word ◊§◊®◊ß◊ú◊ô◊ò (prklyt), which derived from the Ancient Greek word œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ (par√°kletos), which means lawyer.

They have been culturally distinct from the majority Orthodox Christian Macedonian community for centuries, and are ethnically and linguistically distinct from the larger Muslim ethnic groups in the greater region of Macedonia: the Albanians, Turks and Roms. However, some Torbe≈°i also still maintain a strong affiliation with Turkish identity and with Macedonian Turks. The regions inhabited by these Macedonian-speaking Muslims are Debarska ≈Ωupa, Oktisi, Drimkol, Reka, and Golo Brdo (in Albania). Origins The Macedonian Muslims are largely the descendants of Orthodox Christian Slavs from the region of Macedonia who converted to Islam during the centuries when the Ottoman Empire ruled the Balkans.Andrew Rossos, Macedonia and the Macedonians: a history, Hoover Institution Press, 2008, , p. 52. The various Sufi orders (like the Khalwati, Rifa'is and Qadiris) all played a role in the conversion of the Slavic and Paulician population.Hugh Poulton, Who are the Macedonians?, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 1995, , pp. 29-31. Areas of settlement The largest concentration of Macedonian Muslims can be found in western North Macedonia and eastern Albania. Most of the villages in Debar regions are populated by Macedonian Muslims. The Struga municipality also holds a large number of Macedonian Muslims who are primarily concentrated in the large village of Labuni≈°ta. Further north in the Debar region many of the surrounding villages are inhabited by Macedonian Muslims. The Dolna Reka region is also primarily populated by Macedonian Muslims. They form the remainder of the population which emigrated to Turkey in the 1950s and 1960s. Places such as Rostu≈°a and Tetovo also have large Macedonian Muslim populations. Most of the Turkish population along the western Macedonian border are in fact Macedonian Muslims. Another large concentration of Macedonian Muslims is in the so-called Torbe≈°ija which is just south of Skopje. There are also major concentrations of Macedonian Muslims in the central region of the Republic of Macedonia, surrounding the Plasnica municipality and the Dolneni municipality. Demographics The exact numbers of Macedonian Muslims are not easy to establish. The historian Ivo Banac estimates that in the old Kingdom of Yugoslavia, before World War II, the Macedonian Muslim population stood at around 27,000. Subsequent censuses have produced dramatically varying figures: 1,591 in 1953, 3,002 in 1961, 1,248 in 1971 and 39,355 in 1981. Commentators have suggested that the latter figure includes many who previously identified themselves as Turks. Meanwhile, the Association of Macedonian Muslims has claimed that since World War II more than 70,000 Macedonian Muslims have been assimilated by other Muslim groups, most notably the Albanians (see Albanization). It can be estimated that the Macedonian Muslim population in North Macedonia in the year 2013 is 40.000 people. Language and ethnic affiliation Like their Christian ethnic kin, Macedonian Muslims speak the Macedonian language as their first language. Despite their common language and racial heritage, it is almost unheard of for Macedonian Muslims to intermarry with Macedonian Orthodox Christians. Macedonian ethnologists do not consider the Muslim Macedonians a separate ethnic group from the Christian Macedonians, but instead a religious minority within the Macedonian ethnic community. Intermarriage with the country's other Muslim groups (Bosniaks, Albanians and Turks) are much more accepted, given the bonds of a common religion and history. When the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was established in 1944, the Yugoslav government encouraged the Macedonian Muslims to adopt an ethnic Macedonian identity. This has since led to some tensions with the Macedonian Christian community over the widespread association between Macedonian national identity and adherence to the Macedonian Orthodox Church.Duncan M. Perry, \\"The Republic of Macedonia: finding its way\\", in Politics, Power and the Struggle for Democracy in South- East Europe, ed. Karen Dawisha, Bruce Parrott, p. 256. (Cambridge University Press, 1997) Political activities The principal outlet for Macedonian Muslim political activities has been the Association of Macedonian Muslims. It was established in 1970 with the support of the authorities, probably as a means of keeping Macedonian Muslim aspirations in control.Hugh Poulton, \\"Changing Notions of National Identity among Muslims\\", in Muslim Identity and the Balkan States, ed. Hugh Poulton, Suha Taji-Farouki (C. Hurst & Co, 1997) The fear of assimilation into the Albanian Muslim community has been a significant factor in Macedonian Muslim politics, amplified by the tendency of some Macedonian Muslims to vote for Albanian candidates. In 1990, the chairman of the Macedonian Muslims organization, Riza Memedovski, sent an open letter to the Chairman of the Party for Democratic Prosperity of Macedonia, accusing the party of using religion to promote the Albanisation of the Macedonian Muslims.http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-macedonia-muslims.PDF A controversy broke out in 1995 when the Albanian-dominated Meshihat or council of the Islamic community in North Macedonia declared that Albanian was the official language of Muslims in Macedonia. The decision prompted protests from the leaders and members of the Macedonian Muslim community. Occupation Many Macedonian Muslims are involved in agriculture, and also work abroad. Macedonian Muslims are well known as fresco-painters, wood carvers and mosaic- makers. In the past few decades large numbers of Macedonian Muslims have emigrated to Western Europe and North America.

He recruited (with his cousin, Captain Bartholomew Gosnold) about forty of the 104 would-be colonists, and was the only shareholder to sail. In the first election in the New World, he was elected by his peers as the President of the governing council for one year beginning 13 May 1607, of what became the first successful, English-speaking colony in the New World at Jamestown, Virginia. After four months, on 10 September, because \\"he ever held the men to working, watching and warding\\",Wingfield, E.M., p. 43, q. in Wingfield, J., p. 341. and because of lack of food, death from disease and attack by the \\"naturals\\" (during the worst famine and drought for 800 years), Wingfield was made a scapegoat and was deposed on petty charges.Sheler, The Smithsonian, January 2005, p. 53; and see n. 74 re petty charges. On the return of the Supply Boat on 10 April 1608, Wingfield was sent back to London to answer the charge of being an atheist, and one suspected of having Spanish sympathies. Smith's prime biographer, Philip L. Barbour, however, wrote of the \\"superlative pettiness of the charges... none of the accusations amounting to anything.\\" Wingfield cleared his reputation, was named in the Second Virginia Charter, 1609, and was active in the Virginia Company until 1620, when he was 70 years old. He died in England in 1631, ten weeks before fellow Jamestown settler John Smith, and was buried on 13 April at St Andrew's Parish Church, Kimbolton.\\"Captain Smith did not carry the first colonists to Virginia; he landed there himself \\"as a prisoner\\". He did not support the colony there by his exertions; the colonists were dependent on England for supplies; they were succored by every vessel that arrived during his stay in Virginia, and at no time were they found to be more in need than when Argall arrived in July 1609, during Smith's own presidency. So long as he stayed, the colony was rent by factions, in which he was an active instrument. ... He not only failed to give satisfaction to his employers, but he gave great dissatisfaction, and was never employed by the Council of the Va. Co. again. He was in England from December 1609, to March 1614. The troubles and misfortunes of the dark days of 1611‚Äì12 caused many (who were evidently ignorant of the true state of affairs) to place confidence in Smith's claims, and under their patronage his reason for \\"the defailement\\" was published, which proves that he did not even know the real causes which produced the troubles; but the generality in England knew no better, and this tract probably gained for him the favor of four London merchants, not members of the Va. Co., who sent him on a voyage with Captain Hunt to our New England coast, March to August 1614 ... He was taken prisoner by a French vessel, while his own crew escaped. After this remarkable event, his self-assertions failed to have any value with businessmen, although he seems to have constantly sought employment abroad. For the remainder of his life, he was \\"a paper tiger\\" at home...\\", The Genesis of the United States of America by Alexander Brown (London, 1890) Early life Wingfield was born in 1550 at Stonely Priory (dissolved ca. 1536), near Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire (present-day Cambridgeshire), the eldest son of Thomas Maria Wingfield, the Elder, and Margaret (n√©e Kaye; from Woodsome, Yorkshire).See n. 2 (Birth).

Because Sir Richard Wingfield stood by while she married her lover, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, there in France, without the permission of Henry VIII, Mary agreed to be godmother to Thomas Wingfield, the second son of Sir Richard and his wife Bridget, and the child became Thomas Maria or Thomas Mary Wingfield. This middle name was proudly borne and continued by Thomas Maria to two of his ten children: Edward Maria Wingfield and Thomas Maria (the Younger). The 6th and last Edward Maria Wingfield of the family died in Richmond, Virginia in 1984. With the Dissolution of the Monasteries and Henry VIII's break with Rome in 1534, Mary, the Dowager Queen of France, accepted Anglicanism as the state religion, as did the majority of the population, including Wingfield. sister of King Henry VIII, not Henry VIII's same named devoutly Catholic daughter, Mary Tudor. Edward's father, Thomas Maria Wingfield, MP (who had in 1536 renounced his calling as a priest), died when Edward was seven years old.Thomas Maria Wingfield graduated from Oxford in 1534, having held the living of Warrington, Lancashire, from his mid-teens, of his father (died 1525), then-Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Around 1536, Thomas Maria renounced an ecclesiastical career, and became Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1553. (Foster, Alumni Oxonienses, q. in Victoria County History, Lancashire, vol.

CSP (Foreign) for 19 June 1589 sub \\"Causes of Lord Willoughby's Displeasure against Captain Thomas Maria Wingfield\\", states that Thomas Maria had indeed captured Don John and Don Luis and \\"knew of no order against taking prisoners; indeed the General had promised to give away the four best.\\" [This was to reward Grimstone and Redhead for the key role they had played in planting the false Intelligence about betraying Bergen]. \\"The prisoners were given into Captain Best's keeping. Next morning as they marched to the town, Wingfield asked to have the keeping of one of them, as a means of securing his brother's release. His Lordship said he could have none of them... but gave him leave to compound with [negotiate] with Grimstone and Redhead.\\" This Thomas Maria did and \\"Grimston yielded his claim to Don John.\\" Then his Lordship found that Don John was a marquis and so was reluctant to let Wingfield have him; but \\"he promised, if Wingfield could not have Don John, to give him -L-300 to buy Terrayze (another prisoner) to exchange for his brother Wingfield [i.e Jamestown's future 1st President], however [T. M. Wingfield] agreed with Grimstone to take a Spaniard named Orteyse instead of Don John.\\" Nine weeks later his brother captured two Spanish officers at Bergen, but was not permitted by the Allied Commander-in-Chief, Peregrine Bertie, 13th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, to exchange them (though he was mysteriously paid later). He and Gorges were, however, no earlier than June 1589, released as part of a prisoner exchange.See n.18(conceivably part of this was back pay); Hasler, III, pp. 635‚Äì636. =Soldiering in Ireland= In the 1590s, Captain Wingfield was garrisoned at Drogheda, IrelandCSP (Ireland). ‚Äì where commanders reported for pay, rations and munitions to the Clerk of the Cheque & Muster- Master, Colonel Sir Ralph Lane,DNB sub Lane, Ralph; Blore, VCH Rutland, 1911, Pedigree of Lane. the former Deputy Governor of Sir Walter Ralegh's ill-fated 1584‚Äì86 Roanoke Colony (in modern-day North Carolina). Lane was Wingfield's father's old neighbour in Orlingbury, near Kimbolton.VCH Northants, eds. Doubleday and Salzman [1904‚Äì1912]. =Service in Parliament= In 1593, Wingfield was a member of parliament for Chippenham, Wiltshire, one of five Wingfield family MPs ‚Äì a seat obtained for him by his neighbour, Anthony Mildmay of Apethorpe, probably encouraged by Wingfield's cousin, Sir Robert Cecil. He may have sat on a committee considering cloth in March, but this (and parliament) he decided was not for him, and he returned shortly afterward to the soldier's life at the Dundalk Garrison in Ireland.Cecil's aunt Elizabeth Cecil was married to Sir Robert Wingfield II of Upton near Burghley, grandson of Sir Henry Wingfield of Orford Castle (fl. 1490s), the great great uncle of Edward Maria Wingfield. This seat in the Commons was perhaps a sort of present for being held some 18 months a Prisoner of War. [Hasler, III, p. 635] =Kimbolton School Governor= Wingfield was a Feoffee, or Governor, of Kimbolton School in 1600Current Guide to Kimbolton Castle, p. 2. One of the school boarding houses is till called \\"Wingfield\\". ‚Äì which riled his old fellow-colonist from 1569 in Ireland, Sir John Popham, a keen promoter of Virginia; and indeed they clashed over getting their own men onto the school's Board of Governors.Abstract of the Feoffment for the Endowment of Kimbolton School, 10 Nov 42nd Eliz; Popham had just banished Sir Edward to County Galway for life, for the part he had played in the Revolt of the Earl of Essex in 1599, doubtless telling him that this would prevent his being executed, and sequestered Kimbolton Castle, sending his family to their London house at St. Andrew's, Holborn.Stratford, pp.12‚Äì14. Wingfield had appointed his nephew, Gamaliel Crews, as a feofee ‚Äì which Popham objected to. Despite his pleas, Queen Elizabeth I never permitted Sir Edward to return home.Brown, Alexander, II, p. 978 sub Ratcliffe, John; parish church where Wingfield's nephew, Lewis Marya Wingfield was christened on 15 August 1592 [IGI]. Organizing the Virginia Expedition =Getting the Virginia Expedition Moving= Although Sir Thomas Gates was later hailed by Sir Edwin Sandys as the \\"principle forwarder\\" of the London Virginia Company, Captain John Smith wrote in his General Historie that, when in 1605‚Äì06 the Jamestown expedition was making no progress, Wingfield got it moving: \\"Captain Bartholomew Gosnold (Wingfield's second cousin), one of the first movers of this plantation, having many years solicited many friends, but found small assistance; Gosnold at last prevailed with some gentlemen, Capt John Smith, Mr Edward-Maria Wingfield, Mr Reverend Robert Hunt, and diverse others, who depended a year upon his projects, but nothing could be effected, till by their great charge and industry, it came to be apprehended by certain of the Nobility, Gentry and Merchants, so that His Majesty by his letters patents, gave permission for establishing Councils, to direct here; and to govern, and to execute there.\\"Carew Papers, IV, p. 368; Stafford, Thomas, Pacata Hiberna, 1633; reproduced 1820, II, pp. 556‚Äì557; see n. 2. It has been posited that Cecil, Hakluyt and others were concerned that they should not have a leader like the Earl of Essex, who might set up his own kingdom in Virginia, and therefore sought out an old retired military man instead. (Bartholomew Gosnold's next brother, Captain Wingfield Gosnold, was not to sail with the expedition).Otley Hall family tree q. in Wingfield, Jocelyn, pp. 152, 277. Gosnold (aka Gosnell) may have been \\"Captain Gosnell\\" who, in 1604 at a dinner in the Isle of Wight made some \\"intemperate\\" comment about the King, so perhaps causing important people to shun him. There is no record of Smith (or indeed Hunt) doing anything special, but Gabriel Archer, who was on Gosnold's 1602 \\"Cape Cod Expedition\\", had in that year been active in recruitment in London.Costs of ships. 10 April 1605. \\"The merchants of London, Bristol, Exeter and Plymouth, soon perceived what great Gains might be made of a Trade this Way...[i.e. settling Virginia]... sufficiently evinced by the great Profits some Ships had made.... Encouraged by this Prospect, they join'd together in a Petition to King James the First, shewing forth that it would be too much for any single person to attempt the Settling of Colonies, and to carry on so considerable a Trade: They therefore prayed His Majesty to incorporate them, and enable them to raise a joint Stock for that purpose, and to countenance their undertaking... His Majesty did accordingly grant their petition, and by Letters Patent, bearing the date the 10th of April, 1606, did in one Patent incorporate them into Two distinct Companies\\": Tho.

Therefore One vessel-ton cost more than -L-10 (1609 costs) or more than $1,704.45 (at today's prices). In 1606 the tonnage of the 3 little ships was 120 + 40 + 20 = 180 tons, which then cost c. -L-1,800 ‚Äì or at 2007 prices -L-1.4 million or $2.8 million. Weapons & ammo. In 1561 keeping the army in Ireland cost Queen Elizabeth -L-12,000 (or $341,000) a year. [Wingfield, Jocelyn, \\"Virginia's True Founder\\", p. 29]. EDWARD MARIA WINGFIELD's uncle Jaques Wingfield, Master of the Ordnance in Ireland, used to draw around -L-2,000 ($56,800) of ordnance and defence stores per visit from the Tower of London. Victuals, drink & catering stores. -L-?? Wingfield was involved in fundraising and was one of the biggest backers of the venture, with family friends, Sir Thomas Gates, Sir William Waad (aka Wade) (Lieutenant-Governor of the Tower of London), Sir Thomas Smythe (Treasurer of the Virginia Company), John Martin, Sr., Sir Oliver Cromwell and Captain John Ratcliffe (aka Sicklemore).

Wetheringsett marched with the Wingfield manors of Crowiled, Coddenham, Gosbeck and Hemingstone. He also had the living of Gedney, the next village to Holbeach, where the Wingfields had a connection too.

It is presumed that the Mary Harington of Exton who married Sir Edward Wingfield (\\"Ned\\") of Kimbolton, that keen soldier and jouster, ca. 1600, was his sister, but this cannot yet be confirmed by Harington family or other records. [Estimate from Pedigree of Harington (\\"one \\"R\\") in the Markham Memorials, p. 40]. Other known post-1606 but pre-early 1609 backers of Jamestown: Thomas West, 3rd Baron De la Warr, MC fro Va.

The Scriveners lived and live in London, as well as at Belstead, Ipswich, and at Sibton, Suffolk (as did Anthony Wingfield, a second cousin of Edward Maria). Matthew's sister, Elizabeth Scrivener, of Belstead, married Sir Harbottle Wingfield of Crowfield, Suffolk, near Letheringham. [Scrivener Pedigree]. And their son Henry married Dorothy Brewster, from the Brewsters so prolific NE of Crowfield. The Scriveners twice married Wingfields in this period. Clearly recruited by Edward Maria Wingfield.

There is no record of stock owned by: (1) Captain Gabriel ARCHER, MC for Va, 1607 to 1609‚Äì10; (2) Nor Captain Bartholomew GOSNOLD of Grundisburgh near Otley & Letheringham. Bartholomew's next younger brother ‚Äì of 3 ‚Äì was Captain Wingfield Gosnold (who had a daughter Mary who married Richard Pepys, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland and died in 1660). [Gosnold Pedigree at Otley Hall]. Their Aunt Ursula Gosnold wife of Rober the JP, was born Ursula Naunton, daughter of William Naunton and his wife, Elizabeth Wingfield of Letheringham Abbey, daughter of Sir Anthony Wingfield, KG (died 1552), Head of EDWARD MARIA WINGFIELD's family. And Bartholomew & Wingfield Gosnold's great aunt, Katherine Gosnold (n√©e Blennerhasset), married (ii) Anthony Wingfield of Sibton, Suffolk (where stood the ancestral home of the Scriveners). So Bartholomew Gosnold was the 2nd cousin by marriage (two generations removed) of Wingfield. There is also no record of stock owned by Rev Robert HUNT, (if the one who went up to Magdalen, Oxford in 1589, one of his neighboring clerics on being ordained, was Richard Hooker, friend and former tutor of Sir Edwin Sandys); by Captain George KENDALL (Jamestown, 1607, a cousin of Sir Edwin Sandys); nor by Captain Christopher NEWPORT. The William BREWSTER who paid -L-20 may have been the one who sailed with Wingfield or he may have been one of the Pilgrim Fathers. From which it will be seen that the greatest expense by far was the ships, thereby confirming that the merchants were the chief planners/organisers. =Recruiting settlers= In 1606, without Wingfield's input through his extensive influential contacts, it is possible that the expedition might never have sailed. In 1605‚Äì06 Wingfield and his cousin Bartholomew Gosnold, recruited about 40% of the 105 settlers.3rd Earl of Southampton. Edward Wingfield's grandmother, Bridget Wingfield nee Wiltshire, m. (ii) Sir Nicholas Harvey. Their son & heir, Lord William Harvey m. (1) Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, whose son & heir was his namesake, the 3rd Earl. [Brown, II, p. 1061 sub \\"Henry Wriothesley\\"]; Barbour, pp.105‚Äì106. Barbour, pp. 105‚Äì106. Most of the would-be gentlemen settlers were impecunious younger sons without prospects, but more than a dozen gentleman (as Dr. John Horn observes), and Captain John Martin ... \\"clearly were gentlemen with other motives, perhaps just the adventure in its own right\\".Dr. W. Kelso & B. Straube, Jamestown Rediscovery VI, pp. 6‚Äì7. Wingfield wrote that he could not \\"forsake the enterprise of opening so glorious a kingdom unto the king.\\" [Wingfield, E.M., Discourse, last sentence, q. in Wingfield, Jocelyn, p. 343]. Wingfield obtained the approval of Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, his old London vicar at St. Andrew's, Holborn, for the Reverend Robert Hunt of Old Heathfield (who was in disgrace from his arrival there in 1602 for immorality with his servant, Thomasina Plumber, and for absenteeism and thereby neglect of his congregation). This recruitment may have been with the help of Richard Hakluyt, Jr., who was also due to sail, or maybe he was volunteered by Wingfield's cousin-by-marriage the 3rd Lord De La Warr, the future Governor-General of Jamestown; and Hunt had his will witnessed by a Tristram Sicklemore, so may have already known John Sicklemore aka Ratcliffe.Wingfield, Jocelyn. pp. 54, 163. Possibly a relative of Edward Seklemore of Roanoke (1585). [Durant, p. 166]. The Archbishop's approval was dated as late as 24 November 1606 ‚Äì yet, sadly, at the very last moment Hakluyt, the senior of the two priests, backed out.Wingfield, Jocelyn. p. 163. Hunt was already fleeing from his adulterous wife (who had been seeing too much of one John Taylor) and his two young children in Reculver, Kent; Renshaw, W. C., Notes from the Act Books of the Archdeaconry Court of Lewes in Sussex Archaeological Collections, vol. 49 [1906], q in Benjamin Woolley, 2007, pp. 36; n. 16. Lord De la Warr was Lord of the Manor of Old Heathfield. Edward Maria's uncle, Charles Wingfield, wed Jane Knollys, sister of Sir Francis Knollys, KG, whose daughter, Anne married Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr, father of the Roanoke backer, Thomas, the 3rd Baron and future Governor- General of Jamestown; Parks. p. 256. =Catholics debarred from colonisation = Despite the fact Sir Thomas Howard (Lord Southampton's brother-in-law) and Baron Arundell, both Roman Catholics, as well as Sir Ferdinando Gorges, had funded the spring 1605 expedition to Allen's Island (in present-day Newfoundland), designed to establish a colony for British Catholicism, there is absolutely no way that Wingfield or indeed Hunt (described by Wingfield as \\"a man not in any way to be touched with the rebellious humours of a popish spirit, nor blemished with the least suspicion of a factious schismatic, whereof I had a special care\\"), could have had Catholic or Non-conformist leanings, the more so in the wake of the previous year's Catholic Gunpowder Plot. All would-be colonists had to subscribe to the Oath of Allegiance and the Oath of Supremacy of 1559, which denied the doctrine of the Pope's authority, in both deposing rulers and in absolving Englishmen from their allegiance. Indeed the latter oath debarred Roman Catholics from participation in Anglo-American colonisation ‚Äì until George Calvert, a Catholic convert, founded Maryland for persecuted Roman Catholics and Puritans in 1634.Andrews, Matthew Page. Soul of a Nation (1943), p. 55 =Getting the Expedition legalised= \\"Virginia\\" was the term for all of British America in 1607. The 1606 Charter. On 10 April 1606, Wingfield was one of eight \\"incorporators\\" of the Virginia Company,MS C82/1729(1), National Archives Image Library, London, p. 5 who \\"prayed His Majesty to incorporate them, and to enable them to raise a joint stake\\". Divided into two missions, four men sub-incorporated as the Virginia Company of London and four as the Virginia Company of Plymouth, which would attempt to found a colony at Kennebec River. The four for the London (Jamestown) Company, besides Wingfield, being Richard Hakluyt, Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers ‚Äì (i.e. these suitors ensured the legality of the Company). They prayed His Majesty to incorporate them, and to enable them to raise a joint stake. The Charter stated: \\"James, by the grace of God, King of England ... Whereas our loving and well disposed subjects, Sir Thomas Gates, and Sir George Somers, Knights, Richard Hackluit, Clerk...and Edward Maria Wingfield, Esq... have been humble suitors unto us, that we would vouchsafe unto them and may in time bring the infidels and savages in those parts, to human civility, and to a settled and quiet government, Do, by these our letters patent, graciously accept of, & agree to, their humble and well intended desires....and do therefore, for Us, our heirs and successors, Grant and agree, that the said Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, Richard Hackluit, [sic] and Edward Maria Wingfield, adventurers of and for our city of London... shall and may begin their said first plantation...and seat of their first abode & habitation ... Richard Hakluyt, Edward Maria Wingfield, [etc.]: Adventurers... of and for our City of London, and such others as are or shall be joined unto them of that Colony... shall and may begin their said first Plantation and Seat of that first Abode and Habitation, at any place upon the said coast of Virginia, where they shall think fit and convenient between the said four and thirty and one and forty [34‚Äì41] degrees of the said Latitude...\\" He and his fellow incorporators were licensed by King James I to \\"make habitation, plantation and to deduce a colony in that part of America \\"commonly called Virginia, and other parts and territories not actually possessed by any Christian prince or people, between 34 and 45 degrees North and \\"shall and may inhabit and remain there, and shall build and fortify [there] ... \\"according to their best discretion\\" ... \\"and shall and lawfully may ... dig, mine and search for all manner of mines ... yielding to us ... the fifth part only of all the same gold and silver and the fifteenth part of all the same copper... and they shall or fully may establish and cause to be made a coin, to pass current there between people... with sufficient shipping, and furniture of armour, weapons, ordnance, powder, victuals\\" etc... The Charter went on to say: that Wingfield, Hakluyt, Gates and Somers could \\"encounter, repulse or repel and resist\\" all persons attempting to inhabit the said colonies \\"without especial licence\\" and that anyone they caught \\"trafficking\\" i.e. trading, should pay \\"five of every hundred of such wares\\". Anyone robbing or spoiling was to make restitution. Everything was to be in effect for 25 years before reverting to the Crown and all land was to be held of the Crown. Wingfield apparently took a copy of the 1st Virginia Charter with him to Virginia, something that would have been provocative to a man like Gabriel Archer. Two days before he sailed ‚Äì which was about the time that his Bible was stolen ‚Äì he made over his estate at Stonely to seven friends and neighbours (including two Pophams and Hakluyt's friend and Wingfield's neighbour, Pickering) and five relations (including four Wingfields).Parks, p.256; Percy; Manchester Papers, DDM54/2, The Stonely Deede, in the CRO, Huntingdon. It was not a Mortgage of 1606, but a defeasance (the annulment) dated 1620 of the 1602 deed. See www.wingfield.org sub \\"Virginia's Founder\\". For theft of Bible: Wingfield, E.M., p.39 q. by Wingfield, Jocelyn., pp. 164, 337‚Äì338. His signature is also on DDM47a/11. For the southern colony (Jamestown) Wingfield was the only adventurer (one risking his means) and venturer (one risking his life) to sail. The four patentees for each of the two colonies (Jamestown, and Sagadahoc ‚Äì in modern-day Maine) had, as stated above, \\"licence to make habitation, plantation and to deduce a colony.\\" The two colonies were to be controlled by the King's Council of Virginia ‚Äì which included not only the indomitable Sir Thomas Smythe, but also Wingfield's old comrade-in-arms and fellow Prisoner of War (for 18 months in 1588‚Äì1589) in Spanish captivity, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and Wingfield's cousin-by-marriage, Lord de la Warr. Jamestown =Departure= Three little ships, the Susan Constant, the Discovery and the Godspeed sailed from Blackwall Dock, London under the overall command of Captain Christopher Newport on 19 December 1606 to found Jamestown; and \\"the fleet fell from London\\" on 20 December.Percy, Discourse. =Commander for the Voyage only= The Council of Virginia had decreed on 10 September 1606 that Newport was commissioned and given by the Council \\"with the sole charge and command of all the captains and soldiers, and mariners, and other persons, that shall go in any of the said ships and pinnace in the said voyage from the day of the date hereof [i.e. 13 weeks prior to settling at Jamestown] until such time as they shall fortune 'to land' upon the said coast of Virginia.\\" Newport, \\"was hired only for our transportation\\" (wrote Smith).Arber & Bradley, eds., Smith's Travels & Works, [Edinburgh, 1910], II, p. 388. From 26 April 1607 everyone knew who was a councillor, but not who was President ‚Äì and knew that the first British presidential election was not to be before they had found \\"and landed\\" at a good site to settle. This was not a propitious beginning, and likely caused friction between the Councillors as they \\"jostled\\" to obtain votes. =Arrival= On 26 April 1607. \\"...the first land they made, they called Cape Henry\\" for Prince Henry, the young heir to the throne. Here Newport and Wingfied likely would have made a formal Declaration claiming Virginia for the Crown. That night the box was opened and the orders [dated 20 November 1606] read out. Wingfield [et al.] were to be on the Council and were to elect a President for a year from their number. =Reconnaissance and election= \\"Until 13 May they sought a place to plant in, then the Council was sworn, and Mr. Wingfield was chosen President, and an Oration made...\\" ‚Äì by him, probably immediately after being sworn in. This was the first-ever democratic election in the New World.Smith, op cit, III, 1966 facsimile, p. 42; Seed, pp. 1‚Äì15, 41‚Äì63, 69‚Äì73, 179‚Äì193 q. in Horn, p. 48. =Command and control= At 57 Wingfield was about double the age of some of the Council. He had successfully petitioned the King for the Charter, was a \\"captain of success\\" in defence- works and skirmishing (patrolling)Wingfield, Jocelyn, op.cit., Chaps. 5‚Äì9 and was one of the expedition's main stockholders. Thus, he was the obvious choice for President. However, the line of Command and Control and of \\"Land and Sea Force Cooperation\\" was problematic, since the President was not to command the mariners (as Sir Richard Grenville had at Roanoke), and the handover details were \\"woolly\\".Durant, p. 24. =A Soldier's siting= The Council in London had advised the settlers \\"to sit (set) down\\" possibly \\"on some island that is strong by nature... and not overburthened with woods... so far up as a bark (barque) of 50 tons will float ... perchance .. a hundred miles from the river's mouth\\" \\"with no native people to inhabit between you and the sea coast\\".Brown, II, p. 957 sub Newport; Hamor, pp.32‚Äì33; Instructions by Way of Advice, for the Intended Voyage to Virginia, pp.1‚Äì5 q. in Wingfield, Jocelyn. pp. 291‚Äì295 Probably the key factor which swayed Wingfield into selecting Jamestown, was Ralph Lane's error at Roanoke in 1584, having the ships a mile from their campDurant, pp. 52‚Äì53 (?Shallowbag Bay) q.in Wingfield, Jocelyn. p. 194. ‚Äì and, as an experienced soldier not wanting to split his force, therefore kept his heaviest ship with them. So, on 12 May, Wingfield vetoed Archer's Hope, the first site proposed, as too visible (thus easily bombarded by foreign ships' guns). At Jamestown, the ships could be secured to the overhanging trees ‚Äì even the 120-ton Susan Constant. That Wingfield (who as a \\"suitor\\" was instructed by the King to site their \\"abode and habitation... and to begin their ...first plantation\\" at any place he thought \\"fit and convenient\\"1st Virginia Charter q. at n. 37.) succeeded in rejecting Archer's Hope (i.e. haven), and selected the present Jamestown site (some upriver), showed that he was a tough character. =Archer's Hope= Small in number, the colonists had to decide whether to concentrate their defences against either sea attack by the French and Spanish, or against possible assault from native tribes in the area. Archer's Hope would have been better for firing down on approaching Spanish ships (i.e. large targets), since it was higher than Wingfield's river-level island/isthmus site at Jamestown.Hume, p.131. But for warding off land or canoe attacks by the \\"naturals\\", Jamestown's low field of fire was more easily defended with infantry. Wingfield was a soldier experienced in warding off Spanish foot soldiers and Irish guerrillas in dyke or swampland. Since the Councillors were not yet sworn, after two weeks of everyone arguing the pros and cons of different sites, a decision had to be made before they developed into a rabble. Furthermore, only the Kecoughtan tribe lay between them and the coast, whereas if he had sited the settlement upstream, five further tribes would have cut them off from escape. Jamestown was described by Smith as \\"a very great place for the erecting of a great city\\" and by Hamor as \\"a good and fertile island\\". =Work and guard duties= During his Presidency Wingfield had the James Fort constructed in a month and a day. Barbour claimed he had no proven military service ‚Äì which is nonsense, since his long service in the military in Ireland and up to fifteen years in the Low Countries is listed in the Calendar of State Papers.Wingfield, Jocelyn. pp. 32‚Äì71, 86‚Äì124; Memorials at Jamestown Church and Kimbolton Church; Hasler, p. 635. Since of the dozen or so captainsNewport, Gosnold, and Radcliffe (aka Sicklmore) were naval captains; Wingfield, Kendall, Smith, Archer and Flower were or had been army captains. Percy was in the military in Ireland 1599‚Äì1604; Richard Crofts and Corporal Edward Morris were Captains. (Fynes Moryson, Itinerary, II, p.345 and III, pp. 13 & 250 q. in Barbour, pp. 427‚Äì428). he was by far the most experienced soldier in defence-works and defensive warfare, Wingfield supervised the construction of the fort (140 yards by by plus three artillery \\"blisters\\" of each) ‚Äì involving the felling of perhaps 500‚Äì600 30 ft-trees, cutting them in half and burying one end firmly in the ground: a vast task. During construction, George Kendall supervised a temporary defence-work of the felled \\"half-moon of trees and brushwood... the boughs of trees cast together\\" as cover, prior to the ends of the huge triangular palisade being \\"joined up\\", as was normal military practice. \\"Newport and Smith and twenty others were sent to discover the head of the river\\", wrote Smith (rather than \\"Newport decided to go exploring\\" ‚Äì as so many books would have it).See n. 4. President Wingfield was now in charge, but before long his cousin Gosnold warned him that he was driving the men too hard, ever holding them to \\"working, watching, and warding.\\"Smith, GH. p. 42 =Repulsing attack= 27 May 1607: Belying Smith's statement that the weapons were kept boxed or casked, President Wingfield successfully repulsed a fierce, hour-long attack on Jamestown, leading from the front. Outnumbered 3:1 ‚Äì with but 130 men and boys ‚Äì he drove off 400 native warriors. \\"... And our President, Mr Wynckfeild (who showed himself a valiant Gentleman), had one shot clean through his beard, yet 'scaped hurt\\" [escaped being injured], wrote Archer. Percy also called Wingfield \\"a true, valiant gentleman\\".Archer, pp. 54‚Äì55; Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th Edition. The First Holy Communion at Jamestown, 22 June 1607 (as depicted in Old Heathfield Church, Sussex, England).The lovely east window of the north aisle [www.wingfield.org sub \\"churches\\" and \\"Heathfield, Old\\"] depicts pastor Robert Hunt celebrating \\"the first Communion on American soil on June 11, 1607\\" at Jamestown. [Sunday 21 June in Virginia's True Founder, p. 212; Sunday June 22 in Woolley, p.86]. Three Councilors (one with his back to the observer), complete with ruffs, are shown taking Communion, watched by a Native American warrior with two young native boys. Clearly, since Wingfield was then President, he would be in the front row, maybe with his cousin Bartholomew Gosnold. The features and size are not for real, since no actual likenesses of those two Councilors exist. Smith, elected to the Council the week before, is not shown. The Jamestown settlers are all listed, as well as those intrepid mariners whose names are known to posterity. Robert Hunt is listed on a board in the church as being the incumbent at Heathfield from 1602 to 1608 (the year he died at Jamestown). He was, we know, allowed to receive the income and benefits from Heathfield even when in Virginia. The De la Warrs of the 1880s owned part of the manor of Heathfield ‚Äì and so maybe the Lord de la Warr of the early 1600s, a cousin of Edward Maria Wingfield's, then too owned land at Heathfield, knew Hunt and recommended him to Wingfield. Incidentally, from the church one cannot ‚Äì as it says in several books ‚Äì see the sea (the English Channel, ten miles (16 km) to the southeast). These books muddle Heathfield in Sussex with Reculver in Kent, Hunt's earlier church, which lies fifty miles northeast of Heathfield (on the North Sea). In 1957 the APVA erected in Heathfield church a wooden memorial plaque to Robert Hunt. =Strict ration control= President Wingfield built the great fort,Wingfield, Jocelyn, p.210. sowed the first crops,\\"The 15th June we had finished our fort... we had also sown most of our corn on two mountains. It sprang a man's height from the ground.\\" [Percy]; Francis Perkins (in 1608) wrote that two weeks after arrival the original settlers began to sow ‚Äì both q. in Wingfield, Jocelyn. p. 206. In drought-ridden Virginia ‚Äì the worst drought and famine for 800 years, their seeds didn't just spring up like the barley and pea seeds at Waymouth's 1602 camp at Allen's Island (Maine) ‚Äì 8 inches in 16 days! [Noel Hume, p. 106]. imposed strict rationing ‚Äì planned \\"for the long time until our harvest would be ripe\\" (wrote Wingfield), ‚Äì and \\"every meal of fish or flesh should excuse [e.g. would cancel out] the allowance for porridge\\". He got in three weeks' reserve supplies through bartering for food with \\"the Naturals\\", while (as ordered by the Council in London) \\"not offending them\\".Edward Maria Wingfield's \\"Discourse\\" shows how much he and the native American werowances [chiefs] tried to co-exist peacefully when the settlers first arrived: \\"June the 25th [1607]. An Indian came to us from the great Powhatan with the word of peace, that he desired greatly; that the werowances Paspahegh & Tapahanagh, should be our friends and that we should sow and reap in peace.\\" \\"The 3rd of July. 7 or 8 Indians presented the President [Wingfield] a deer from Pamunkey, a werowance [chief] desiring our friendship... Their werowance had a hatchet sent him. .. A little after this came a deer to the President from the Great Powhatan ... The President likewise bought divers times deer of the Indians.\\" \\"The 7th of July. Chief Tappahannah ...hailed us with a word of peace [so President Wingfield took the shallop to visit him]. He said his old store [of food i.e. \\"corn\\" = maize GB was spent; that his new was not at full growth by a foot; that as soon as any was ripe, he would bring it; which promise he truly performed.\\" He had to impose a strict rationing: \\"half a pint of wheat and as much barley boiled with water for a man a day, having fried 26 weeks in the ships hold, contained as many worms as grains\\".Wingfield, E.M., pp. 19‚Äì20, q. in Wingfield, Jocelyn, pp. 222‚Äì224, 233, 318; Instructions by Way of Advice, 1606, p. 3; Smith, GH. p. 44. Arber & Bradley, eds., Smith, Travels & Works, II, p. 391. =Worst drought for 800 years= In the oppressive heat, the diminishing food-stocks and American Indian attacks soon brought disease, death and dissension. President Wingfield and his settlers would not learn that their founding of Jamestown was during the worst seven-year dry spell (1606‚Äì1612) in nearly 800 years ‚Äì which \\"dried up fresh-water supplies and devastated corn crops\\". Dr William Kelso and Beverly Straube of Jamestown Rediscovery are convinced that the colony's fate was \\"beyond the control of either settlers or their London backers\\".Sheler, p. 53 But the settlers were tough. The hardy ones survived that period and won through, establishing, as Dr. James Horn points out, \\"four fundamental characteristics of British America: representative government, private property, civilian control of the military, and a Protestant church\\";Horn, Dr. James. The Lessons of Jamestown, in Pleasant Living, Profile, May/June 2006 pp. 26‚Äì27]. along with English language and customs. Removed as president On 10 September 1607, amid starvation and attacks from native tribes, Wingfield was arrested and deposed from his presidency. The now ex-President was arraigned on the following charges (just as in 1609 the 4th Governor/President Percy ‚Äì with ex-President (the 2nd) Ratcliffe, Archer and Martin ‚Äì was to send the ex-President Smith (the 3rd president) home to answer eight similar, more serious charges):Wingfield, E.M. p. 23 \\"Charges against Smith\\" at Jocelyn Wingfield, pp. 272‚Äì273, were: [1] That he would not submit to the authority of the Council. . [2] That he refused to recognise John Sicklemore as a member of the Council. [3] That he had sent rat poison to the Dutch, his own men, to poison them. . [4] That he had set the Indians on some of the settlers at the Falls [at today's Richmond]. [5] That he had threatened to remove Powhatan's robes and crown (with which Newport, on orders from London, had invested him), unless the great chief gave the settlers corn. [6] That he refused to exchange tools with the Indians for maize, even though the settlers were starving. [7] That he exiled men to starve on the oyster banks. [8] That he \\"would\\" affect a kingdom (the same general charge had been made by him against his two predecessors), in this instance by wanting to marry the Powhatan's teenage daughter, Pocahontas. (1) Calling Smith a liar. (2) Accusing Smith of concealing a mutiny plotted and confessed by Galthrop or Calthorpe, Gent.Percy in Tylers Quarterly Magazine, p. 264; Strachey, p. 62, q. in Wingfield, Jocelyn. pp. 272‚Äì273. (3) Denying Martin a spoonful of beer. Starving Martin's son to death. (4) Accusing Smith's old comrade-in-arms from Transylvania, \\"Jehu Robinson, Gentleman\\" and others of \\"consenting to run away with the shallop\\" to Newfoundland (as it was later called). (5) Starving the colony. [It was \\"suggested\\" that he had had food buried in the ground. Indeed he had, but this was then the normal way to keep food and drink (in casks or vats) from going bad in hot weather, and besides, it did stop rations from being stolen. The future Secretary, William Strachey was to write of such \\"underground storehouses\\", and indeed such food and drink storage methods were then in use in England and indeed were still in use in England and America until well into the 20th century. (6) \\"Banquet and riot, in that he did feed himself and his servants out to the common store.\\" In Wingfield's time everyone was fed out of the common store, although there may have been separate Mess areas for the Council, the Gentlemen and labourers. Clearly, if this charge were true, it would have been made to stick. \\"Mr. Smith, in the time of our hunger\\", wrote Edward Maria, \\"had spread a rumour in the colony that I did feast my servants out of the common store, with intent, as I gathered, to have stirred the discontented company against me\\". No other writer of this period even implies that the President was requisitioning extra rations for himself or his servants. Wingfield started bartering with the Indians and/or stocked up with shot game, \\"for, as his store increased, he mended the common pot: he had laid up besides, provision for 3 weeks' wheat beforehand...I was all for one and one to all.\\" Since Newport's return was a long way off, Edward Maria had imposed fair, very strict ‚Äì and naturally very unpopular ‚Äì rationing on the settlers. (7) \\"That I combined with the Spaniards to the destruction of the colony\\". (8) \\"That I am an atheist, because I carried not a bible, and because I forbid the preacher to preach\\". Why was President Wingfield accused of being an atheist? Because (a) he had no bible with him, (b) he cancelled two ‚Äì or three ‚Äì sermons, and (c) after he had been deposed, he failed to attend church on one or two occasions. [(a) His bible was stolen at Croft's house, just before they sailed from Blackwall. (b) When the men returned from standing to arms or counter-attacks, it was too late to have the sermon ‚Äì and sermons were long in those days: so he cancelled them: \\"On two or three Sunday mornings, the Indians gave us alarums at our town\\", wrote Wingfield... \\"by that times they were answered, the place about us well discovered, and our divine service ended, the day was far spent.\\" (c) And after his arrest (when he was sick and lame), he did not attend on a further one or two occasions when it was raining]. (9) \\"That I affected a kingdom\\". (10) \\"That I did hide the common provision in the ground\\". An additional \\"charge\\" is suggested by Smith's biographer, Philip L. Barbour: \\"that Wingfield was implicated in the planned escape in the pinnace to Spain (not England) by Kendall\\". He wrote that Kendall began whispering about abandoning the colony ‚Äì \\"perhaps with the connivance of Wingfield...and Wingfield seemed implicated\\" etc. His primary source presumably was Thomas Studley (or, rather, Smith ‚Äì see note below), who in June 1608 wrote: \\"Wingfield and Kendall, living in disgrace... strengthened themselves with the sailors and confederates to regain their former credit and authority, or at least such means aboard the pinnace.. to alter her course, and to go for England... Smith...forced them to stay or sink in the river. Which action cost the life of Kendall [who was shot after trial]\\".(1) p. 39, (2) p. 30, (3) p. 40, q. in Jocelyn Wingfield, pp. 164, 227‚Äì228 & chap. 21 n. 20 (four lines below n. 19). Smith further wrote: \\"The President\\" [Ratcliffe aka Sicklemore] and Captain Archer, not long after, intended also, to have abandoned the country.Barbour. 3 Worlds, pp. 153‚Äì154; Thomas Studley (actually John Smith) in The Second Part of a Map of Virginia (1612), The Proceedings of the English Colony in Virginia, in John Smith, Travels & Works (1612), sub \\"T. Studley, ?June 1608\\", ed. Arber, I. pp. 3‚Äì4, 97. (Arber's \\"I.H.\\" writes that \\"Thomas Watson\\" is a printer's error, and that he has since learned should read \\"John Smith\\"). Wingfield, however, was not charged with desertion ‚Äì or he too would surely have been shot. It would seem that Smith got confused, accidentally or deliberately, over the dates of two or three different incidents. Indeed in 1608 Smith had also written: \\"Our store being now indifferently well provided with corn [e.g. maize] there was much ado for to have the pinnace go to England, against which Captain Martin and myself stood chiefly against it: and in fine after many debatings pro et contra, it was resolved to stay a further resolution.\\" Smith, GH. Lib.3, p. 46. Some time after Kendall was shot, Wingfield came ashore from the pinnace and stated to Smith and Archer that: \\"I was determined to go to England to acquaint our Council of our weaknesses ... I said further, I desired not to go into England, if either Mr. President [Ratcliffe aka Sicklemore] would go.\\"Smith, 1623, pp. 346, 349; A True Relation (text at New York Historical Society), p. 13. The President by then was Ratcliffe. Barbour, who wrote of \\"John Smith's usual exaggeration\\", describes \\"the superlative pettiness\\" of the charges against Wingfield...\\"none of the accusations against him amounted to anything ‚Äì not even Archer's assertion that he was in league with the Spaniards to destroy the colony.\\"Wingfield, E.M. p. 31, q. in Jocelyn Wingfield, pp. 243, 391. When the pragmatic Captain Newport, 47, arrived with the First Supply, he found young Smith, 27 ‚Äì having been charged with losing two men to the Indians ‚Äì also under restraint ‚Äì for the second time; and he was, also for the second time since the expedition had set out, due to be hanged (on the morrow). Newport released Wingfield and Smith, waiving all but one of the charges against them both as petty, but he did not reinstate Wingfield, as the charge of being an atheist was so serious that he would have to be sent to England to be tried for it ‚Äì just as Smith was to be later.Barbour, pp. 145‚Äì149. =Attempted reinstatement= The disgruntled settlers now thought that the 2nd President, John Ratcliffe, was the source of all their problems, and Smith, Kendall and Percy planned to send James Read the blacksmith on a maintenance visit to the pinnace, where Wingfield was held, to see if Wingfield would agree to be reinstated, but Ratcliffe learned of these plans and had Read publicly thrashed.See n. 62. =Rebuttal of charges= In his Discourse of Virginia (1608), Wingfield comes across as a tough old soldier ‚Äì too tough with the men, and too old for the job. He \\"could not make ropes of sand\\" as Stephen Vincent Benet described his situationHorn, p. 76; Wooley, pp. 104‚Äì106. Reputation and later career =Reputation= Up to the 1980s, Wingfield's reputation as a villain stems from his chief rival, John Smith, who was apparently prone to supreme exaggeration.Western Star, Book One, [New York, 1943]; Brown, sub EMW, II, p.1055; p.53. Newly freed from arrest, Smith wrote of Wingfield's \\"overweening jealousy\\" i.e. supremely self-confident and suspicious of rivalry ‚Äì which one could argue are two necessary qualities required by a commander. Command is lonely and doubtless the \\"cliqueyness\\" of the \\"Cape Cod Crew of 1602\\" (Gosnold, Martin and Archer), the Middle Temple lawyers (Gosnold and Percy) and the \\"generation gap\\" problem between Wingfield aged 57 vis-a-vis Smith aged 27 (and many men in their 20s and 30s), did not help. Smith also described Wingfield and probably Percy and NewportSmith's so- called History of Virginia is not a history at all; but a eulogy of Smith and a lampoon of his peers\\". Brown, II, p. 1010; Barbour, p. 391. as \\"tufftaffety humorists\\" i.e. overdressed, full of humour and laughter but liable to mood swings. Smith's views of President Wingfield were repeated by John Oldmixon in 1708, then further downgraded by the author of his entry in the (British) Dictionary of Biography of 1880, and more so by Barbour (1964), Smith's biographer. Barbour was obsessively anti-Wingfield, describing him as an aristocrat (i.e. a baron, marquess, viscount, earl or duke), which Wingfield was not, nor before 1618 had any member of his family ever been (although his grandfather was awarded the Knight of the Garter, for his work as an ambassador); and (b) as having three servants at Jamestown; but Smith was no farmer's lad. Smith too was a Captain, had three servants at Jamestown,Smith, GH. possessed a coat of arms, owned property (in Louth, Lincolnshire), had a well-to-do tenant farmer father; and was, moreover, raised with the younger Bertie children and was given a personal equestrian course by the Henry, 2nd Earl of Lincoln, of Tattershall Castle.Smith's servants were Anas Todkill, \\"his man\\" (not Anas), and pageboy Samuel Collier. [Smith, Map of Virginia, Arber, I, p. 132; Smith, GH, p. 448; Andrews, p. 140; Barbour, p. 246 ‚Äì all q. in Wingfield, Jocelyn, p. 271. In 1608, King James \\"induced\\" the Lord Mayor, Sir Humphrey Weld, \\"a member of the Grocer's Company\\", to issue a Precept about corporate funding for Jamestown.Tenements listed in father George Smith's will; Wingfield, Jocelyn, pp. 103‚Äì104 (John Smith was raised with the younger Berties); P. Force. Tracts, 1609, III, p. 37. In the 2 or 3 charges not considered ludicrous by the level-headed Newport, Wingfield defended himself successfully before Archbishop Bancroft in London. =Later involvement with the Virginia Company= Still involved with the Virginia Company at 70, he was still involved in the affairs of the colony a dozen years later, e.g. the Declaration of Supplies intended to be sent to Virginia in 1620, 22 June has: \\"Winckfield, Edward Maria, Captain, Esquire, Adventurer of the Virginia Company, London (Eng.): -L-88.\\".King James induced the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Humphrey Weld, a member of the Grocers' Company, to issue 'a Precept to the Livery Companies' [in order to] \\"to deal very earnestly and effectually with the colonization of Virginia\\". This resulted in corporate support for the Virginia Company for the first time ‚Äì which is so often erroneously quoted as having begun in 1606. Weld reminded them that: Virginia would (a) give the citizens an opportunity of diminishing the risk of famine and pestilence, by removing some of the surplus population, and (b) would also prove a source of profit to Adventurers: indeed emigrants would beget a house, orchard and garden, and land for themselves and their heirs. So, 56 of the Livery Companies joined some 640 other shareholders in \\"The Company of London Adventurers and Planters of the City of London for the Colony of Virginia\\" on 10 April 1609 ‚Äì just before John Smith, the third President at Jamestown, was ‚Äì also ‚Äì sent home to answer questions.

For each configured service, it listens for requests from connecting clients. Requests are served by spawning a process which runs the appropriate executable, but simple services such as echo are served by inetd itself. External executables, which are run on request, can be single- or multi-threaded. First appearing in 4.3BSD, it is generally located at \`/usr/sbin/inetd\`. Function Often called a super-server, inetd listens on designated ports used by Internet services such as FTP, POP3, and telnet. When a TCP packet or UDP packet arrives with a particular destination port number, inetd launches the appropriate server program to handle the connection. For services that are not expected to run with high loads, this method uses memory more efficiently, since the specific servers run only when needed. Furthermore, no network code is required in the service-specific programs, as inetd hooks the sockets directly to stdin, stdout and stderr of the spawned process. For protocols that have frequent traffic, such as HTTP and POP3, a dedicated server that intercepts the traffic directly may be preferable. Setup The list of services that will be serviced is given in a configuration file, usually \`/etc/inetd.conf\`. A GUI for managing the configuration file is an optional accessory. The daemon may need a signal in order to re-read its configuration. For an example, telnet can be configured as follows (line taken from a machine running AIX version 5.1): telnet stream tcp6 nowait root /usr/sbin/telnetd telnetd -a The first word, \`telnet\`, is the official name of the service. It is resolved using the system database to map port numbers and protocols to service names. In this case, \`/etc/services\` should contain: telnet 23/tcp The second and third words describe the type of socket and underlying protocol respectively. The \`/etc/protocols\` database is consulted. The fourth word is the wait/nowait switch. A single-threaded server expects inetd to wait until it finishes reading all the data. Otherwise inetd lets the server run and spawns new, concurrent processes for new requests. The fifth word is the user name, from the \`/etc/passwd\` database, that the service program should run as. Finally, the path and the arguments of an external program are given. As usual, the first argument is the program name. In the example, inetd is told to launch the program \`/usr/sbin/telnetd\` with the command line arguments \`telnetd -a\`. inetd automatically hooks the socket to stdin, stdout, and stderr of the server program. Generally TCP sockets are handled by spawning a separate server to handle each connection concurrently. UDP sockets are generally handled by a single server instance that handles all packets on that port. Some simple services, such as echo, are handled directly by inetd, without spawning an external server. Creating an inetd service This is a simple inetd service, written in C. It expects a command line argument containing a filename for a log file, and then it logs all strings sent through the socket to the log file. Note that this is a very insecure example program. #include #include int main(int argc, char **argv) { const char *fn = argv[1]; FILE *fp = fopen(fn, \\"a+\\"); if (fp  NULL) exit(EXIT_FAILURE); char str[4096]; /* inetd passes its information to us in stdin. */ while (fgets(str, sizeof str, stdin)) { fputs(str, fp); fflush(fp); } fclose(fp); return 0; } The example uses stdio functions and it responds to network traffic coming in on stdin. In this case, we want all messages logged to a single file, so we only want one instance of the service running to service all requests. This means UDP is the correct protocol to use. First, an unused port number must be selected. In this sample, 9999 will be used. The \`/etc/services\` entry will look like this: errorLogger 9999/udp And the entry in \`/etc/inetd.conf\` will look like this: errorLogger dgram udp wait root /usr/local/bin/errlogd errlogd /tmp/logfile.txt This tells inetd to run the \`/usr/local/bin/errlogd\` program, with the commandline: \`errlogd /tmp/logfile.txt\` (refer to the inetd.conf man page for information on the other arguments). The first argument contains the filename to be used for the log file: \`/tmp/logfile.txt\`. inetd will run the service when needed, and attach port 9999 to the input and output streams, and all strings sent to that port will be logged to the file. By specifying wait, it tells inetd to only use one instance of the server to handle all requests. Note: the functionality of the above example is usually implemented by using syslog and a process like syslogd. syslogd would normally be started in parallel with inetd, not as an inetd service. inetd replacements In recent years, because of the security limitations in the original design of inetd, it has been replaced by xinetd, rlinetd, ucspi-tcp, and others in many systems. Distributions of Linux especially have many options and Mac OS X (beginning with Mac OS X v10.2) uses xinetd. As of version Mac OS X v10.4, Apple has merged the functionality of inetd into launchd. The services provided by inetd can be omitted entirely. This is becoming more common where machines are dedicated to a single function. For example, an HTTP server could be configured to just run httpd and have no other ports open. A dedicated firewall could have no services started. systemd supports inetd services, and expands socket activation beyond IP messaging (AF INET+6) to include AF UNIX, AF NETLINK and more.http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket- activation.htmlhttp://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd.html  Security concerns  While the inetd concept as a service dispatcher is not inherently insecure, the long list of services that inetd traditionally provided gave computer security experts pause. The possibility of a service having an exploitable flaw, or the service just being abused, had to be considered. Unnecessary services being disabled and \\"off by default\\" became the mantra. It is not uncommon to find an \`/etc/inetd.conf\` with almost all the services commented out in a modern Unix distribution.

Designed for passenger traffic only, the Chinese government built the line to accommodate trains traveling at a maximum speed of , and currently carries CRH high-speed trains running speeds up to . When the line opened on August 1, 2008, it set the record for the fastest conventional train service in the world by top speed, and reduced travel time between the two largest cities in northern China from 70 to 30 minutes.China inaugurates 220 mph fastest rail service in world in time for Olympics A second phase of construction extended this line from Tianjin to Yujiapu railway station in the Binhai New Area was opened on September 20, 2015. The line is projected to approach operating capacity in the first half of 2016. Anticipating this, a second parallel line, the Beijing‚ÄìBinhai intercity railway, commenced construction on December 29, 2015. It will run from Beijing Sub-Center railway station to Binhai railway station via Baodi and Tianjin Binhai International Airport, along a new route to the northeast of the Beijing‚ÄìTianjin ICR. (The line use the same track as Beijing-Tangshan intercity railway between Beijing Sub-Center railway station and Baodi.) Route and stations Viaduct on the Beijing‚ÄìTianjin intercity railway. =Beijing to Tianjin= From Beijing South railway station, the line runs in a southeasterly direction, following the Beijing‚ÄìTianjin‚ÄìTanggu Expressway to Tianjin. It has three intermediate stations at Yizhuang, Yongle (not yet fully built) and Wuqing. The line currently uses the Jinshan Railway for some extended services to Tanggu. The service has peak speed between cities. As an intercity line, it will provide train service only between the two metropolitan areas, unlike the Beijing‚ÄìShanghai High-Speed Railway which will continue beyond Shanghai. The Beijing‚ÄìTianjin intercity railway has a current length of 116.939 km (fare mileage: 120 km), of which roughly 100 km is built on viaducts and the last 17 kilometres on an embankment. The elevated track ensures level tracks over uneven terrain and eliminates the trains having to slow down to safely navigate through at-grade road crossings. Tianjin railway station =Extension to Binhai New Area= Sometimes known as the Tianjin‚ÄìBinhai intercity railway, this extension continues southeasterly from Tianjin railway station, following the conventional railway to Tanggu railway station but built on elevated piers with three new stations were to be added. It passes a maintenance depot at Airport West, through Junliangcheng North railway station to Tanggu railway station before entering a tunnel to an underground station, Yujiapu railway station. Junctions have been built along the line allowing services to branch off to a new station under Tianjin Binhai International Airport and to Binhai West railway station on the Tianjin‚ÄìQinhuangdao High-Speed Railway. Trial operations of the extension started on August 14, 2015, with official opening on September 20, 2015. the railway reduced travel times from Beijing South station to Yujiapu station to 1 hour 02 minutes and from Tianjin railway station to Yujiapu to 23 minutes. Yujiapu railway station  Service \\"5100\\" brand mineral water. A passenger can get a complimentary bottle on showing his or her intercity train ticket The line opened on August 1, 2008 with 47 daily pairs of intercity trains between Beijing South and Tianjin. Since September 14, 2008, 10 more pairs of trains were added, reducing the minimum interval from 15 minutes to 10 minutes. On September 24, 2008, 4 pairs of trains extended to Tanggu along the conventional railway. On September 28, 2008, 2 more pairs of trains were added into service. Frequencies have consistently been increased since to cope with rising demand. On September 20, 2015, services to Tanggu and Yujiapu transferred on to the parallel high-speed line. These intercity trains are designated by the prefixed \\"C\\" (Âüé) followed by four digits, from C2001 to C2298. Of these, C2001‚ÄìC2198 are non-stop trains from Beijing South to Tianjin. The odd numbers for trains departing from Beijing South and even numbers for those running to Beijing South. Trains numbered C2201‚ÄìC2268 are trains from Beijing South and Tianjin that stop on the way at Wuqing and Yizhuang stations. Trains C2271‚ÄìC2298 run from Beijing South to Tanggu. In addition to the intercity service, 13 pairs of trains were diverted to this line from the preexisting Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) Railway, including trains from Beijing South to Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Tianjin West. With the opening of the Beijing‚ÄìShanghai high-speed railway, these trains have been diverted to the new line. A pair of special track examination trains (numbered DJ01/02) run every day in the morning before any regular trains into service. A track-measuring train (numbered DJ5581/2) runs every ten days. In summary, there are 62 pairs of train in service, 60 of them for passengers. Frequencies are increased over weekends and during major holidays. Following the Wenzhou train crash, maximum speeds were reduced to 300 km/h, with rides taking only three minutes longer than usual. There have been slight drops in fares to accompany the temporary speed limits. =Tickets= Tickets bought at high- speed railway stations are blue magnetic tickets, different from the regular pink tickets Beginning early 2009, \\"Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Concession Card\\" frequent rider stored-value cards were introduced for use on this line. Standard Card holders are allowed unreserved seating in the reserved Second Class carriage, Car 6. Gold Card holders are allocated a few reserved seats in Car 5, which is the First Class carriage. To comply with new ticket ID rules effective June 1, 2011, new and upgraded cards are linked to a document of identity. Train services running through the Tanggu extension implemented \\"commuter\\" fares as of June 1, 2017. According to the new scheme, a discount of 5.85% will be applied to trips using the Tanggu extension, making a second class ticket from Tianjin to Yujiapu costing ¬•12 and a second class ticket from Beijing to Yujiapu costing ¬•54.5. Additional discounts using the \\"Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Concession Card\\" will also still apply. Technical information The line is the first railway in China to be built for operational speeds above 300 km/h. This railway line allows speeds up to 350 km/h.Beijing ‚Äì Tianjin elevated line anticipates 350 km/h, Railway Gazette International March 2006 A trip between Beijing and Tianjin takes 30 minutes. =Rolling stock= Before mid-2009, the railway used CRH2 trains for service. With effect from mid-2009, only CRH3 trains are used for intercity services on the line. High-speed services to Ji'nan, Qingdao and Shanghai, which used to run on this route, are now diverted to the Beijing‚ÄìShanghai high-speed railway. =Signaling system= The signaling system is built around Simis W electronic interlockings, Vicos operations control system and ETCS Level 1 train control system. =Overhead catenary system= The catenary system in use is Sicat HA, aluminum cantilever, powered by two sub-stations at 25 kV 50 Hz AC. =Speed record= Train speed display On June 24, 2008 a Chinese conventional-wheeled train speed record was set on the line when a Siemens Velaro-derived China Railways CRH3 train reached 394.3 km/h.Velaro sets Chinese speed record, Railway Gazette International June 27, 2008 History * Construction of the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity High-Speed Rail Line began on July 4, 2005. * In April 2006, Siemens and its consortium partners EEB (Electrification Engineering Bureau) and CRSC (China National Railway Signal & Communication Corporation) were awarded a contract by the Chinese Ministry of Railways (MoR) to supply and install the signaling systems, communications equipment and power supplies as well as the overhead line and to take over responsibility for system integration and overall project management. * On May 11, 2007 the first interlocking container for the Beijing-Tianjin line left the Siemens factory in Brunswick, Germany.

Ridership  Before the line was finished, it was expected that the railway line would handle 32 million passengers in 2008 and 54 million passengers in 2015. The line opened on August 1, 2008 just before the opening of the 2008 Summer Olympics, which held some football matches in Tianjin. The introduction of high-speed rail service significantly boosted rail travel between the two cities. In 2007, conventional train service between Beijing and Tianjin delivered 8.3 million rides.

It offers a more secure alternative to the older inetd (\\"the Internet daemon\\"), which most modern Linux distributions have deprecated.  Description  xinetd listens for incoming requests over a network and launches the appropriate service for that request. Requests are made using port numbers as identifiers and xinetd usually launches another daemon to handle the request. It can be used to start services with both privileged and non-privileged port numbers. xinetd features access control mechanisms such as TCP Wrapper ACLs, extensive logging capabilities, and the ability to make services available based on time. It can place limits on the number of servers that the system can start, and has deployable defense mechanisms to protect against port scanners, among other things. On some implementations of Mac OS X, this daemon starts and maintains various Internet-related services, including FTP and telnet. As an extended form of inetd, it offers enhanced security. It replaced inetd in Mac OS X v10.3, and subsequently launchd replaced it in Mac OS X v10.4. However, Apple has retained inetd for compatibility purposes.  Configuration  Configuration of xinetd resides in the default configuration file /etc/xinetd.conf and configuration of the services it supports reside in configuration files stored in the /etc/xinetd.d directory. The configuration for each service usually includes a switch to control whether xinetd should enable or disable the service. An example configuration file for the RFC 868 time server: # default: off # description: An RFC 868 time server. This protocol provides a # site-independent, machine readable date and time. The Time service sends back # to the originating source the time in seconds since midnight on January first # 1900. # This is the tcp version. service time { disable = yes type = INTERNAL id = time-stream socket_type = stream protocol = tcp user = root wait = no } # This is the udp version. service time { disable = yes type = INTERNAL id = time-dgram socket_type = dgram protocol = udp user = root wait = yes } The lines with the \\"#\\" character at the beginning are comments without any effect on the service. There are two service versions the first one is based on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the second one is based on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The type and planned usage of a service determines the necessary core protocol. In a simple way, the UDP can not handle huge data transmissions, because it lacks the abilities to rearrange packages in a specified order or guarantee their integrity, but it is faster than TCP. TCP has these functions, but it is slower. There are two column in each versions inside the Braces. The first is the type of option, the second is the applied variable. The disable option is a switch to run a service or not. In most cases the default state is yes. To activate the service change it to no. There are three types of services. The type is INTERNAL if the service is provided by xinetd, RPC when it based on Remote procedure call, they are commonly listed in the /etc/rpc file, or it can be UNLISTED when the service is neither in the /etc/services nor in the /etc/rpc files. The id is the unique identifier of the service. The socket_type determines the way of data transmission through the service. There are three types: stream, dgram and raw. This last one is useful, when we want to establish a service based on a non-standard protocol. With the user option it is possible to choose a user to be the owner of the running service. It is highly recommended to choose a non- root user for security reasons. When the wait is on yes the xinetd will not receive request for the service if it has a connection. So the number of connections is limited to one. It provides very good protection when we want to establish only one connection per time. There are many more options available for xinetd. In most Linux distributions the full list of possible options and their description is accessible with a \\"man xinetd.conf\\" command. To apply the new configuration a SIGHUP signal must be sent to the xinetd process to make it re-read the configuration files. This can be achieved with the following command: \`kill -SIGHUP \\"PID\\"\`. PID is the actual process identifier number of the xinetd, which can be obtained with the command \`pgrep xinetd\`.Linux man page: xinetd.conf(5) http://linux.die.net/man/5/xinetd.conf  References   External links  * openSUSE fork, to contain all the patches from several distributions: openSUSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, ...

The name evolved from the original name \\"T-\\\\phi-gram\\" to describe the axes of temperature (T) and entropy (\\\\phi) used to create the plot. Usually, temperature and dew point data from radiosondes are plotted on these diagrams to allow calculations of convective stability or convective available potential energy (CAPE). Wind barbs are often plotted at the side of a tephigram to indicate the winds at different heights.  Description  The tephigram was invented by Napier Shaw in 1915 and is used primarily in the United Kingdom and Canada. Other countries use similar thermodynamic diagrams for the same purpose however the details of their construction vary. In the tephigram, isotherms are straight and have a 45 degree inclination to the right while isobars are horizontal and have a slight curve. Dry adiabats are also straight and have a 45 degree inclination to the left while moist adiabats are curved. The main reason that tephigrams are used by the British Met Office, the Meteorological Service of Canada, and Met √âireann (Irish Meteorological Service) is the property that areas contained by the curves have equal energies for equal areas, leading to better comparisons of CAPE and hence convective systems.

Ingpen. It is based on the old tales of the Hairy Peruvians, a community of tiny fisherfolk, who centuries ago sprang to life from sacrificial Inca dolls on the coast of Peru. The Hairy Peruvians had lived on this coast for generations, often at the mercy of El Nino, the temperamental sea god. Over the years, many expeditions set out in flimsy reed boats to see a more hospitable land across the ocean to the west, but none returned. The Poppykettle Papers recounts the exploits of Aloof the Far-Sighted and his resourceful sister Arnica and their quest to find the Unchosen Land in the company of Andante the Whistler, Astute the Wise, and their grandfather Don Avante.  Plot summary  This is that tale of five Hairy Peruvians, the last of their kind, and an epic journey from the shores of old Peru to a new land at World's Edge, where the sun goes down. These are no ordinary adventurers, however, but \\"people of sensible size\\", which to us Tall Ones is very small indeed.  Background  In 1980, Robert Ingpen published The Voyage of the Poppykettle, a children's book. He later published The Unchosen Land, its sequel. These stories were so popular in Ingpen's home, Geelong, that a fountain and an annual Poppykettle Festival celebrate the mythical landing of the \\"hairy Peruvians\\". The Poppykettle Papers is an updated re-telling of the original two books.  Historical and folkloric references  The book ties into various historical and folkloric stories of Australia's early settlement. One such story is the discovery in 1847, by Governor Charles La Trobe, of a set of keys embedded in the earth near Corio Bay. These keys, known as the Geelong Keys, are believed by some to have been dropped by Portuguese explorers some hundreds of years previously, but the Poppykettle Papers suggest another origin‚Äînamely, that the Hairy Peruvians left them there.

The name referred to an early vehicle employed by the units, an explosive-laden crewless motorboat (\\"barchino\\") which was aimed and launched against enemy submersibles (keep in mind that until well after World War II subs were essentially surface ships with the capability of temporarily diving underwater for attacks). After World War I much study and development went into underwater raid techniques but the unit's name was never altered, leading to the false impression that Italian seafaring commandos were still relegated to anti-submarine warfare only. Instead many flotillas were armed and equipped to direct raids on enemy ships using explosive head-charges in guided torpedoes with 2-man crews (Siluri a Lenta Corsa or S.L.C.), with hand explosive charges (by frogmen) or with small, fast, self-explosive boats (S.M.A.). =Special Operations Forces= *Sometimes called upon to intervene for special operations the Special Company of the 1¬∞ San Marco Marine Regiment.

The Toucouleur Empire (also known as the Tijaniyya Jihad state or the Segu Tukulor) (1861‚Äì1890) was founded in the mid-nineteenth century by Omar Saidou Tall of the Toucouleur people, in part of present-day Mali. History Omar Tall returned from the Hajj in 1836 with the titles of El Hadj and caliph of the Tijaniyya brotherhood of the Sudan. After a long stay in Fouta-Toro (present day Senegal), he moved to Dinguiraye (to the east of Fouta Djallon in present-day Guinea). This became the staging ground for his 1850 jihad.

A year later he left its management to his son Ahmadu Tall to move against Hamdullahi, the capital of the Fula empire of Massina. Omar Tall failed to conquer Timbuktu, and retreated to Deguemb√©r√©, near Bandiagara of the Dogon region. In 1864, he died there in an explosion of his gunpowder reserves. His nephew Tidiani Tall succeeded him and installed the capital of the Toucouleur Empire at Bandiagara. At Segou, the son Ahmadu Tall continued to reign, successfully suppressing the attempts of several neighboring cities to break away. He came into increasing conflict with his brothers. In 1890, the French, allied with the Bambara, entered S√©gou. Ahmadu Tall fled first to Massina and after his fall in 1893 to Sokoto in present-day Nigeria, marking the effective end of the empire.

Renowned for his refined baritone vocals and performances characterised by emotional intensity and crowd interaction, his career spanning over five decades has enjoyed both critical and commercial success. He is referred to as the \\"King of Folk Music\\" (\\"kralj narodne muzike\\"). Early life ≈†aban ≈†auliƒá was born on 6 September 1951 in ≈†abac, PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia to Huso and Ilduza (n√©e Demiroviƒá). His mother Ilduza is originally from Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He spent a lot of time with his family in Bijeljina. Neither of his parents had a full-time job, as his father sold lottery tickets whilst his mother sold children's toys at fetes. As a result, they would spend a lot of their time travelling and looking for work leaving ≈†auliƒá primarily in the care of his older sister, Sarajka. ≈†auliƒá initially showed interest and affinity for football. It was his uncle Alija, however, who first noticed that his nephew's true talent lay in music. In the mid-1960s, Alija asked his nephew to sing at their local kafana, which was to mark the start of ≈†auliƒá's five decade long musical career. ≈†aban ≈†auliƒá is of Bosniak descent. Career In 1969, at the age of 18, ≈†auliƒá recorded his first single Dajte mi utjehu (\\"Give me Solace\\"). The song became an instant hit and led ≈†auliƒá to make the move to Belgrade, Serbia so that he could continue working on what was promising to be a successful career. By the mid-70s, ≈†auliƒá had become a household name and his songs were much requested in kafane. ≈†auliƒá was also a judge on the televised singing competition Zvezde Granda between 2013 and 2016, and the televised singing competition \\"Pinkove zvezde\\" in 2016-2017 season. Personal life In 1974, ≈†auliƒá married his wife, Gordana (b. 1958). The pair briefly separated in 1985; during this period, ≈†auliƒá wrote and dedicated the song \\"Gordana\\" to her. ≈†auliƒá and his wife reconciled after just 20 days. Together, they had three children; a son, Mihajlo, and two daughters, Sanela and Ilda. Ilda is also a singer. Prior to his marriage to Gordana, ≈†auliƒá had a son out of wedlock, named Robert. He acknowledged him and provided financial support until Robert turned 18. ≈†auliƒá's father died unexpectedly during ≈†aban's concert tour of Australia. He was not able to attend his father's funeral which was held the very next day. ≈†auliƒá would often express how he would never be able to come to terms with the fact that he was not in attendance. Look ≈†aban ≈†auliƒá has lost his hair in 1974. He has made one of the wigs in Germany, which has dropped in 2002 in favour of real bald scalp because of the famous Serbian basketball player Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá. Death In the early hours of 17 February 2019, ≈†auliƒá was being driven to the airport on his way home as he had held a concert the night before in Bielefeld, Germany. His best man, Boban Stojadinoviƒá, was a fellow passenger in the car. His keyboardist, Mirsad Keriƒá, who had accompanied him to the concert, was driving. At approximately 06:50 am, on the Bundesautobahn 2 between Bielefeld and G√ºtersloh, a drunk and unlicensed driver violently collided with the SEAT Ibiza that ≈†auliƒá was travelling in. This caused serious injuries to all passengers. All three were rushed to the hospital, where ≈†auliƒá and Keriƒá were later pronounced dead. The news of ≈†auliƒá's death was met with widespread shock and sorrow from his colleagues and fans. He was buried on 22 February 2019 in the Alley of Distinguished Citizens at the Belgrade New Cemetery. In February 2020 he was awarded Golden Medal of Merits of Republic of Serbia.

Most Core Foundation routines follow a certain naming convention that deal with opaque objects, for example CFDictionaryRef for functions whose names begin with CFDictionary, and these objects are often reference counted (manually) through \`CFRetain\` and \`CFRelease\`. Internally, Core Foundation forms the base of the types in the Objective-C standard library and the Carbon API. The most prevalent use of Core Foundation is for passing its own primitive types for data, including raw bytes, Unicode strings, numbers, calendar dates, and UUIDs, as well as collections such as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, to numerous macOS C routines, primarily those that are GUI- related. At the operating system level Core Foundation also provides standardized application preferences management through \`CFPropertyList\`, bundle handling, run loops, interprocess communication through \`CFMachPort\` and \`CFNotificationCenter\`, and a basic graphical user interface message dialog through \`CFUserNotification\`. Other parts of the API include utility routines and wrappers around existing APIs for ease of use. Utility routines perform such actions as file system and network I/O through \`CFReadStream\`, \`CFWriteStream\`, and \`CFURL\` and endianness translation (Byte Order Utilities). Some examples of wrapper routines include those for Core Foundation's wrapper routines for Unix sockets, the CFSocket API. Some types in Core Foundation are \\"toll-free bridged\\", or interchangeable with a simple cast, with those of their Foundation Kit counterparts. For example, one could create a \`CFDictionaryRef\` Core Foundation type, and then later simply use a standard C cast to convert it to its Objective-C counterpart, \`NSDictionary *\`, and then use the desired Objective-C methods on that object as one normally would. Core Foundation has a plug-in model () that is based on the Microsoft Component Object Model.

He is often described as part of the turbo-folk scene, and is known for his Serbian patriotic songs. His cousin was the pop-folk recording artist Ksenija Pajƒçin. Pajƒçin is not to be mistaken with Nedeljko Bajiƒá Baja (to whom he owes his nickname due to their physical resemblance), who is another Bosnian Serb folk singer. Early life Pajƒçin was born on 13 October 1966 into a Bosnian Serb family in the village of Gubin, near Livno, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Pajƒçin moved to SR Serbia in 1980, and began singing in 1984 in Surƒçin. Controversy and career Baja won a 1989 competition for amateur singers in Livno and released his first album in 1991. His career began just as Yugoslavia was breaking up. Throughout the 1990s, he was known for his strong Serbian nationalism and nationalist songs supporting the Serbs during the Yugoslav wars; during the Croatian War of Independence he was dubbed Baja Mali-Knind≈æa (literally meaning \\"Baja little Kninja\\" in reference to the de facto capital, Knin, of the Serbian ethnic breakaway state of Serbian Krajina within Croatia and its armed force). His first professional success was the song \\"–í—Ä–∞—Ç–∏ —Å–µ –í–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–æ\\" (Come Back, Voivode), in which he appealed to Serbian World War II Chetnik commander Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá to come back to the areas of the Croatian Krajina and help lift the spirits of the Croatian Serbs. He said that he would never consider going to Croatia as he claimed that Croatian soldiers \\"burned down his house and desecrated his ancestors' graves\\". Baja performs at \\"–ö–æ—á–∏—õ–µ–≤ –∑–±–æ—Ä\\" (Koƒçiƒá's Assembly) in Zmijanje near Banja Luka in mid-August every year, and he usually attracts tens of thousands of people. Since Operation Storm, Pajƒçin has written many songs about his dream of the Serb people returning to live in territories now inhabited by Croats following the Croatian War for Independence. Pajƒçin is controversial due to his Serbian nationalism and Serbian far-right views and bias in lyrics. Most of his songs are condemned in non-Serb parts of Bosnia and Croatia because of their xenophobic lyrics, which often reference war leaders during the Yugoslav wars. For example, his song \\"Ne volim te Alija\\" describes his strong dislike for the Bosnian wartime president Alija Izetbegoviƒá and includes the lyrics: : –ù–µ –≤–æ–ª–∏–º —Ç–µ, –ê–ª–∏—ò–∞, / I don't like you, Alija : –ó–∞—Ç–æ —à—Ç–æ —Å–∏ –±–∞–ª–∏—ò–∞ / Because you are a Balija (a derogatory term for Bosniaks) : –°—Ä—É—à–∏–æ —Å–∏ –º–∏—Ä–∞–Ω —Å–∞–Ω / You destroyed a peaceful dream : –ù–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ —Ç–∏ –î—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–æ –º—É—ü–∞—Ö–µ–¥–∏–Ω–∞ / May the river Drina take hundreds of your mujahideen : –°–≤–∞–∫–∏ –¥–∞–Ω / Every day In one song titled \\"ƒÜuti, ƒÜuti Ujko!\\" (the song and music video feature Serbian rock star Bora ƒêorƒëeviƒá, \\"I will kill you\\" as well as \\"Shut up, shut up, mujo (Bosnian Muslim), I will kill you\\". He has also sung \\"I don't like people who like the HDZ\\", which included the lyrics \\"Fuck their ≈°ahovnica\\". Despite many of his songs having a nationalistic lyrical theme, he is also known for his often humorous non- political songs such as \\"Umri Baba\\" and \\"Poker Aparat\\". He has also sung anti- communist songs such as \\"Bila Jednom Jedna Zemlja\\" and the song \\"Komunjare\\", which says: : –ö–æ–º—É—ö–∞—Ä–µ, –∫–æ–º—É—ö–∞—Ä–µ / Commies, commies : –≤–∏ –≤–æ–ª–∏—Ç–µ —Å–∞–º–æ –ø–∞—Ä–µ / All that you love is money : —Å–≤–∏ —Å—Ç–µ –≤–∏ –∫–æ–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏ / All of you communists : –ø—Ä–∞–≤—ô–µ–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ –∫–∞–ª—É–ø –∏—Å—Ç–∏ / Are cast in the same mould Personal life Pajaƒçin lives with his wife, three daughters and a son in Zemun.

Biography  Mojsisovics was the son of the surgeon Georg Mojsisovics von Mojsvar (1799‚Äì1860). His name in Hungarian: √ñd√∂n. He was born in Vienna. He studied law in Vienna University, taking his doctorate degree in 1864, and in 1867 he entered the Geological Institute, becoming chief geologist in 1870 and vice-director in 1892. He retired in 1900, and died at Mallnitz on October 2, 1907.  Works  Mojsvar paid special attention to the Cephalopoda of the Austrian Triassic, and his publications include: * Das Gebirge um Hallstatt (1873, 1876). * Die Dolomitrisse von S√ºdtirol und Venetien (1878‚Äì1880). * Grundlinien der Geologie von Bosnien-Herzegowina (1880), with Emil Tietze and Alexander Bittner. * Die Cephalopoden der mediterranen Triasprovinz (1882). * Die cephalopoden der Hallst√§tter Kalke (1873, 1902). * Beitr√§ge zur Kenntniss der obertriadischen Cephalopodenfaunen des Himalaya (1896). With Melchior Neumayr (1845‚Äì1890) he conducted the Beitr√§ge zur Pal√§ontologie und Geologie √ñsterreich-Ungarns (Contributions to the Palaeontology and Geology of Austria-Hungary). In 1862, with Paul Grohmann and Dr. Guido von Sommaruga, he founded the √ñsterreichischer Alpenverein (Austrian Alpine Club), and he also took part in establishing the German Alpine Club (Deutscher Alpenverein), which combined with the former in 1873. He is responsible for naming the stage on the geologic time scale known as the \\"Carnian\\", after the Carnian Alps, in 1869.

It is relevant particularly in corporate law and constitutional law. Apparent authority refers to a situation where a reasonable third party would understand that an agent had authority to act. This means a principal is bound by the agent's actions, even if the agent had no actual authority, whether express or implied. It raises an estoppel because the third party is given an assurance, which he relies on and would be inequitable for the principal to deny the authority given. Apparent authority can legally be found, even if actual authority has not been given. -deluxe There must be some act or some knowing omission on the part of the principal‚Äîif the agent alone acts to give the third party this false impression, then the principal is not bound.Legal Dictionary Entry on Apparent Authority. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so acts in the presence of the principal, and the principal stands silently and says nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the authority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a principal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third parties of this termination. This is called lingering apparent authority. Business owners can avoid being liable by giving public notice of the termination of authority, and by contacting any individual third parties who would have had reason to know of such authority. In relation to companies, the apparent authority of directors, officers and agents of the company is normally referred to as \\"ostensible authority.\\" Apparent authority issues also arise in the Fourth Amendment context, concerning who has authority to consent to a search.When is a Parent‚Äôs Authority Apparent? Reconsidering Third Party Consent Searches of an Adult Child‚Äôs Private Bedroom and Property, Criminal Justice, Vol. 24, pp. 34‚Äì37, Winter 2010. Legal provisions The doctrine of apparent authority is based on the concept of estoppel, thus, it prevents the principal from denying the existence of agency to a third party, provided that a representation, as to the agent's authority, has been made by him to the third party either through his words or by his actions. In law, apparent authority refers to the authority of an agent as it appears to others,Hely- Hutchinson v Brayhead Ltd [1968] 1 QB 549 at 583 and it can operate both to enlarge actual authority and to create authority where no actual authority exists.See First Energy (UK) Limited v Hungarian International Bank [1993] BCLC 1409 The law relating to companies and to ostensible authority are in reality only a sub-set of the rules relating to apparent authority and the law of agency generally, but because of the prevalence of the issue in relation to corporate law (companies, being artificial persons, are only ever able to act at all through their human agents), it has developed its own specific body of case law. However, some jurisdictions use the terms interchangeably. In Freeman and Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480 the director in question managed the company's property and acted on its behalf and in that role employed the plaintiff architects to draw up plans for the development of land held by the company. The development ultimately collapsed and the plaintiffs sued the company for their fees. The company denied that the director had any authority to employ the architects. The court found that, while he had never been appointed as managing director (and therefore had no actual authority, express or implied) his actions were within his ostensible authority and the board had been aware of his conduct and had acquiesced in it. Diplock LJ identified four factors which must be present before a company can be bound by the acts of an agent who has no authority to do so; it must be shown that: # a representation that the agent had authority to enter on behalf of the company into a contract of the kind sought to be enforced was made to the contractor; # such a representation was made by a person or persons who has 'actual' authority to manage the business of the company, either generally or in respect of those matters to which the contract relates; # the contractor was induced by such representation to enter into the contract, i.e. that he in fact relied upon it; and # under its memorandum or articles of association the company was not deprived of the capacity either to enter into a contract of the kind sought to be enforced or to delegate authority to enter into a contract of that kind to an agent. The agent must have been held out by someone with actual authority to carry out the transaction and an agent cannot hold himself out as having authority for this purpose.Armagas Ltd v Mudogas SA [1986] AC 717 The acts of the company as principal must constitute a representation (express or by conduct) that the agent had a particular authority and must be reasonably understood so by the third party. In determining whether the principal had represented his agent as having such authority, the court has to consider the totality of the company's conduct.Egyptian International Foreign Trade Co v Soplex Wholesale [1985] BCLC 404 at 411 The most common form of holding out is permitting the agent to act in the conduct of the company's business, and in many cases this is inferred simply from allowing the agent to use a particular title, such as 'finance director'. The apparent authority must not be undermined by any limitations on the company's capacity or powers found in the memorandum or articles of association, although in many countries, the effect of this is reduced by company law reforms abolishing or restricting the application of the ultra vires doctrine to companies.For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 35A of the Companies Act 1985; in Canada, see section 18 of the Canada Business Corporations Act However, statutory reforms do not affect the general principle that a third party cannot rely upon ostensible authority where it is aware of some limitation which prevents the authority arising, or is put on enquiry as to the extent of an individual's authority.A L Underwood v Bank of Liverpool [1924] 1 KB 775 In some circumstances, the very nature of a transaction would be held to put a person on enquiry.For example, where a director paid cheques drawn in favour of the company into his personal bank account (see A L Underwood v Bank of Liverpool) The rule in Turquand's case The rule in Turquand's case does not enable a third party to hold the company to an unauthorized transaction per se. It allows a third party to assume that a transaction which is within the authority of the directors has been properly authorized, but it requires the third party to establish the fact of authority, actual or apparent, in the first place. Ratification It is open to the principal to ratify an unauthorised agreement entered into by an agent. Ratification is the explicit or implicit action of the principal in agreeing, after the unauthorised act, to the act of the agent. Ratification by the principal causes such act to become binding on the third party. Note that without ratification by the principal, the third party is not bound to the unauthorized agreement created by an agent with no apparent authority, until the principal ratifies it. Whereas in the situation of an act done by an agent with ostensible (or apparent) authority, the principal and the third party are bound from the moment the agreement is consummated by the agent and third party.

He was the founder of the national drama.  Early life  The youngest of eight children, his mother died in childbirth, and he had a troubled relationship with his father. Kisfaludy began writing poems and songs while in the army from 1804 to 1811. He saw active service in the Napoleonic Wars in Italy, Serbia and Bavaria. After his return in 1810 he courted a girl named Katalin Heppler, but did not marry. His resignation from the army alienated his father, and he took refuge at his sister Ter√©z's house in Vas County.  Education  He studied art, travelling to Vienna in 1812 and Italy in 1815, but had no luck with either writing or painting until April and June 1819, when his tragedies A tat√°rok Magyarorsz√°gon (\\"The Tatars in Hungary\\") and Ilka, vagy N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r bev√©tele (\\"Ilka, or the Capture of Belgrade\\") were a great success. He followed them up immediately with other dramas he had written: Stibor vajda (\\"The Voivode Stiber\\") and A k√©r≈ëk (\\"The Suitors\\"), in September, and A p√°rt√ºt≈ëk (\\"The Insurgents\\") in November; and the next year wrote three more.Stanley Hochman. McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world drama. McGraw-Hill, 1984. His plays were translated into German, and performed in Vienna.  Personal life  In 1822 he founded the periodical Aurora, for which he was awarded the Marczib√°nyi Prize in 1826, the same year that his father reinstated him in his will. He fell in love with a woman named Nina L√∂ffler, but because she was Jewish he could not marry her. He wrote prolifically for Aurora until his death from tuberculosis in 1830. The Kisfaludy Society was created in his honour in 1836. He is remembered for his plays and epigrams, and for poems like his elegy Moh√°cs (1824), on the subject of the battle of 1526.

It opened as Theatr Clwyd in 1976, but was known between 1998 and 2015 as Clwyd Theatr Cymru, before reverting to its original name. History Theatr Clwyd opened in 1976. It forms part of the County Civic Centre at Mold (Yr Wyddgrug), being immediately adjacent to the County Hall (the administrative offices of the former administrative county of Clwyd, now the offices of the Flintshire County Council). It was built at the instigation of the former Flintshire County Council before that was abolished in the local government reorganisation of 1974 and replaced by Clwyd County Council. The complex was opened by Queen Elizabeth II under the artistic direction of George Roman. Toby Robertson was the theatre's artistic director between 1985 and 1992. Robertson introduced several leading actors, including Vanessa Redgrave, Sir Michael Hordern and Timothy Dalton, to the theatre. Robertson was succeeded as artistic director by Helena Kaut-Howson, followed by Terry Hands from 1997 to 2015. Hands' successor, Tamara Harvey, was appointed in June 2015. HTV Wales had offices and a studio at the site from the late 1970s to the mid 1980s, but production was scaled back following the opening of the company's new studio complex at Culverhouse Cross in Cardiff. A small news operation remained in Mold until the late 1990s but closed when HTV moved its North Wales news operations to Colwyn Bay and Wrexham. The name of the complex was changed to Clwyd Theatr Cymru in 1998 to reflect the reorganisation of local government at that time which abolished Clwyd as a county and brought Flintshire back into existence, although defined by different borders from the original ones. However, in 2015 the complex reverted to its original name. Apart from hosting visiting theatre companies, Theatr Clwyd is home to Wales' major drama producing theatre company, under the artistic direction of Tamara Harvey, which stages their own productions throughout the year (including one of the longest-running pantomimes in the country) and also regularly performs on tour around Wales and the UK. Theatr Clwyd hosted the successful second stage performance of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Its capital was at Hamdullahi. History The Fulas of the region had for centuries been the vassals of larger states, including the Mali Empire (13th-14th centuries), the Songhai Empire (15th century), the Moroccan pashas of Tomboctou (16th century), and the Bambara Empire at S√©gou (17th century). By the early 1800s, many of these larger states had declined in power and inspired by the recent Muslim uprisings of Usman dan Fodio in nearby Hausaland, preacher and social reformer Seku Amadu began efforts at increasing religious revivals in his homeland. Early struggle created the Massina leadership and in 1818 Seku Amadu led a jihad against the Bambara Empire in 1818. The empire expanded rapidly, taking Djenn√© in 1819 and establishing a new capital at Hamdullahi in 1820. At the height of the Empire's power, a 10,000 man army was stationed in the city, and Seku Amadu ordered the construction of six hundred madrasas to further the spread of Islam. Alcohol, tobacco, music and dancing were banned in accordance with Islamic law, while a social welfare system provided for widows and orphans. A strict interpretation of Islamic injunctions against ostentation led Amadu to order the Great Mosque of Djenn√© to be abandoned, and all future mosques were ordered built with low ceilings and without decoration or minarets. One of the most enduring accomplishments was a code regulating the use of the inland Niger delta region by Fula cattle herders and diverse farming communities. In 1825, Seku Amadu conquered Timbuktu. He died in 1845, leaving control of the Massina Empire to his son, Amadu II, who was succeeded by his son Amadu III. In 1862, Omar Tall of Toucouleur launched an attack on the Massina from his newly secured base at S√©gou. After a series of bloody battles, he entered Hamdullahi on March 16, leveling it. Amadu III was captured and put to death. Though resistance briefly continued under Amadu III's brother Ba Lobbo, the destruction marked the effective end of the Massina Empire.

A branch line with a junction immediately beyond the end of the platforms was opened on 1 June 1903. This ran around the outskirts of Exmouth on a long, curving viaduct, passing through Littleham and then on to Budleigh Salterton meeting the Sidmouth branch line at where it connected with an earlier line to Sidmouth Junction railway station. This route was used for through carriages from London Waterloo station sometimes called the Atlantic Coast Express and also a short while from Cleethorpes, which ran via the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway and Templecombe railway station. The line was closed to all traffic on 6 March 1967 following publication of the report The Reshaping of British Railways.\\"Disused Stations - Budleigh Salterton\\"Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 31 May 2016 The original station consisted of a single platform with a track on either side. It was rebuilt with four platform faces, opening on 20 July 1924. An engine shed was provided from the earliest days on the east side of the station, opposite the platforms. It was closed on 8 November 1963 following the introduction of DMU services on the line. The signal box was closed on 10 March 1968 after which only one train was allowed south of and only one platform of the four-platform station was required. The station building was demolished and replaced with the present building. A single face (the old platform 2) was opened on 2 May 1976. The eastern side of the station was used for a new road which opened on 10 December 1981; the town's bus station and a swimming and sports centre are also built on the old station site. Following the privatisation of British Rail the station was operated by Wales & West from 1997 to 2001 and Wessex Trains from 14 October 2001 until 31 March 2006 when operation of the station transferred to Great Western Railway.

The Christmas Flood of 1717 (; ) was the result of a northwesterly storm, which hit the coast area of the Netherlands, Germany, and Scandinavia on Christmas night of 1717.Die Weihnachtsflut vom 24. Dezember 1717 History In total, about 14,000 people drowned. It was the last large storm flood in the north of the Netherlands. Floodwaters reached the towns and cities of Groningen, Zwolle, Dokkum, Amsterdam, and Haarlem. Many villages near the sea were devastated entirely, such as in the west of Vlieland and villages behind the sea dykes in Groningen Province. The local communities had to cope with population loss, economic decline, and poverty. No area of the coast between the Netherlands and Denmark was spared. Everywhere, dyke breaches were followed by wide flooding of the flat country. Between T√∏nder in Slesvig and Emden in East Frisia, about 9,000 people drowned. The Netherlands had 2,500 victims. The worse-affected areas were in the County of Oldenburg, around Jever, Kehdingen, and the principality of East Frisia. Butjadingen lost 30% of its population. In all the affected coastal areas, a large number of cattle were lost. In East Frisia, 900 houses were washed away completely. The damage to dykes and sluices was immense. Survivors remained unaware of the fate of missing family members for a long time. For example, of 284 persons missing from Werdum in East Frisia, only 32 of them had been found by 5 February 1718. The impact of this storm flood in the cold winter time‚Äîtwo days after this flood came hard frost and snowfall‚Äîwas worsened on the night of 25 or 26 February by another storm flood.

McManus, \\"Eulogy for the godfather of the anti-cult movement\\", The Free Lance-Star, Fredericksburg, VA, 1989-8-26.  Birth and early years  Martin was born in Brooklyn, New York to George Washington Martin II (1876‚Äì1948) and Maud Ainsworth (1892‚Äì1966). His father was a prominent figure in the legal profession who served as an assistant District attorney, before working as a criminal trial lawyer. In 1920 George Martin became a county court judge and presided over cases involving some of the notorious Murder Inc criminals.\\"G.W.Martin Dies; Ex- County Judge\\" New York Times, 23 November 1948, p. 30. Martin's mother, Maud Ainsworth, was born in Chicago to Joseph Ainsworth and Annie Young. She was one of several children born of that marriage, but was put up for adoption. She was adopted by her uncle and aunt James McIntyre (theatrical actor) (1857‚Äì1937) a vaudevillian (one partner of the black-face duo, \\"Thomas Heath and Jim McIntyre\\"), and Emma Maude Young (1862‚Äì1935), a dancer and balladeer (known on stage as \\"Maude Clifford\\" and \\"Maud Clifton\\").\\"James McIntyre, Stage Star, Dies,\\" New York Times, 19 August 1937, p. 19. Martin was raised in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, and was the youngest of six children. In his earliest years the family lived on Macdonough Street, and then from 1930 onwards on Bainbridge Street, Brooklyn.The family is identified as living at these residences in the 1920 US Federal Census and 1930 US Federal Census.

Brown & Rosemary Brown, They Lie in Wait To Deceive, Volume 3, Mesa, Arizona: Brownsworth Publishing, 1986, pp. 5-6.  Continuing education  Dr. Martin held four earned degrees including a Master of Arts Degree in Philosophy from New York University, where he was a student alongside television evangelist D. James Kennedy. Kennedy confirmed the fact that Martin had completed all of the coursework for his doctorate, with the exception of his dissertation.(Jill Martin Rische, www.waltermartin.com) He subsequently obtained a Ph.D. in 1976 from California Coast University, which was approved (not accredited) by the state of California at the time the degree was awarded.California Education Code, Section 94310(b) (see Controversies below)  Early career  Martin's career as an apologist began at the age of fifteen after being baptized in Hegemen Chapel at The Stony Brook School (Stony Brook, NY). While in college and graduate school, he often skipped eating during his lunch hours to answer a variety of tough questions about the Bible and the Christian faith while standing on the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, in New York City. Martin has indicated in various book dedications and in audio recorded lectures how he was mentored by Frank Gaebelein (Headmaster, The Stony Brook School),Martin, Essential Christianity, p. 12 Wilbur Smith (1894‚Äì1976) (author of the apologetic text Therefore Stand), and the Presbyterian Bible teacher Donald Grey Barnhouse (1895‚Äì1960).Walter R. Martin \\"Dedication\\" in Walter Martin's Cults Reference Bible, Santa Ana: Vision House, 1981.Walter R. Martin, The Rise of the Cults, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1955, p. 8. Jill Martin Rische, Walter Martin Ministries, www.waltermartin.com Martin's relationship with Barnhouse as his mentor grew over the years, and he was appointed as a regular columnist to Eternity magazine (1955‚Äì60). Barnhouse's support for Martin's research and teaching abilities resulted in the reassessment of Seventh Day Adventist theology, raising the profile of his early ministry in the Evangelical movement.Margaret N. Barnhouse, That Man Barnhouse, Wheaton: Tyndale House, 1983, p. 223. He also worked for a time as a research associate for the National Association of Evangelicals.\\"Dr.Walter R. Martin\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 13, Number 4, April 1970, p. 3. Martin was ordained as a minister of the Regular Baptists in 1951, but this was revoked in 1953 owing to his remarriage. However, Martin met with the key pastor involved in this revocation and a restoration agreement was apparently reached, as Martin began marrying couples on television and continuing in public pastoral roles with the full knowledge of the Baptist denomination.Martin Rische, Questions on Walter Martin's Ordination, www.waltermartin.com His status as a minister has been the subject of much controversy but his daughter, Jill Martin Rische, has made more information available that puts much of the controversy to rest. Walter Martin served as a pastor in various churches in New York and New Jersey in the 1950s and 1960s. He also became a regular teacher of Bible study classes at Barnhouse's Church in New York City. In later years Martin would serve as a preacher and Bible teacher at Melodyland Christian Center Robert Quebedeaux, The Worldly Evangelicals, San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1978, p. 66.Anson Shupe, Six Perspectives on New Religions, Lewiston, New York: Edwin Mellen Press, 1981, p. 71. and then at Newport Mesa Christian Center in California. = Evangelical-Adventist controversy = Perhaps the greatest public controversy of his early career arose from his studies of Seventh-day Adventist theology. From its earliest days until the 1950s, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was regarded by Evangelical Christians and mainstream Protestants as either an extreme sect or heretical cult.Malcolm Bull & Keith Lockhart, Seeking A Sanctuary: Seventh-day Adventism and the American Dream, San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1989, pp. 28-29. Martin had initially accepted the prevailing Protestant opinion about the heretical status of the Seventh-day Adventists. He indicated his opposition to Adventist teachings in a brief paragraph in the inaugural edition of his book The Rise of the Cults, published in 1955.Martin, The Rise of the Cults, p.15. However, he reversed his views after a series of interviews with various leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and on reading Adventist literature. Martin reported his initial findings to Barnhouse, and between 1955-56 a series of small conferences were held, with Barnhouse and Martin meeting Adventist leaders like T. E. Unruh and LeRoy Froom.T. E. Unruh, \\"The Seventh-day Adventist Evangelical Conferences of 1955-1956,\\" Adventist Heritage, Volume 4, Number 2, Winter 1977, pp.35-46.\\"Peace with the Adventists,\\" Time Magazine, 31 December 1956, pp. 40-41.Kenneth R. Samples, \\"From Controversy to Crisis: An Updated Assessment of Seventh-day Adventism,\\" Christian Research Journal, Volume 11, Number 1, Summer 1988, p. 9. Barnhouse and Martin then published some of their findings in a series of articles that appeared in Eternity Magazine between September and November 1956.Donald Grey Barnhouse, \\"Are Seventh-day Adventists Christians? A New Look at Seventh-Day Adventism\\" Eternity, September 1956, pp. 6-7 & 43-45.Walter R. Martin, \\"The Truth About Seventh-Day Adventism: Its Historical Development from Christian Roots,\\" Eternity, October 1956, pp. 6-7 & 38-39.Walter R. Martin, \\"The Truth About Seventh-Day Adventism: What Seventh-Day Adventists Really Believe,\\" Eternity, November 1956, pp. 20-21 & 38-43.\\"Are Seventh-day Adventists Evangelicals?\\" Christian Life, October 1956, pp. 58-60. The standpoint taken by Barnhouse and Martin was that Adventists were largely orthodox on central doctrines, but heterodox on lesser doctrines, and so could be classified as belonging in the Evangelical camp. Martin later expanded his position in his 1960 book-length treatment, The Truth About Seventh-day Adventism.Walter R. Martin, The Truth About Seventh-day Adventism, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1960. Martin's book carried an explanatory foreword by Barnhouse and a statement from H. W. Lowe who was the chairman of the Biblical Study and Research Group of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.The Truth About Seventh-day Adventism, pp. 7-8 and 15. While Lowe did not agree with Martin's criticism of the church's distinctive doctrines he nonetheless commended the book for providing a \\"fair and accurate statement of Adventist teachings.\\"The Truth About Seventh-day Adventism, p.15. A committee of Adventist leaders themselves wrote and published a companion book, Seventh- day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine, in 1957. While many Adventists welcomed the overtures of Barnhouse and Martin, there were other Adventists who questioned the position taken by church leaders in the volume Questions on Doctrine.see the historical accounts of Keld J. Reynolds, \\"The Church Under Stress 1931-1960\\" in Adventism in America, ed. Gary Land, Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 1986, pp. 185-188; Geoffrey J. Paxton, The Shaking of Adventism, Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1978, pp.87-96. In the late 1950s and early 1960s Evangelical opinions were divided over the Martin-Barnhouse stance on the Adventists. Some, like E. Schuyler English,E. Schuyler English, \\"To Rectify a Wrong\\" Our Hope, Volume 52, Number 8, February 1956, pp. 457-459. supported Martin, some such as John Gerstner urged a sober and fair hearing,John H. Gerstner, The Theology of the Major Sects, Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1960, p. 19. while others, such as Louis Talbot,Louis Talbot, \\"Why Seventh-day Adventism Is Not Evangelical\\", The King's Business, April 1957, pp. 23-30. J. K. van Baalen,J. K. van Baalen, The Chaos of Cults, rev. ed., Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962, pp. 228-256.

Hoekema, The Four Major Cults, Exeter: Paternoster, 1969, pp. 388-403. opposed his view. As the controversy ensued among Evangelicals Martin found it was necessary to restate and defend his position and to reply to his critics. To that end Martin reproduced much of the text of his 1960 book, together with critical replies in an appendix \\"The Puzzle of Seventh-day Adventism\\" in his 1965 textbook The Kingdom of the Cults.Walter R. Martin, The Kingdom of the Cults, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1965, pp. 359-422. Martin later updated the appendix in the 1985 edition of Kingdom of the Cults, and since his death the editors of the posthumous editions of 1997 and 2003 have continued to update it.Kingdom of the Cults, Rev. Ed, Minneapolis: Bethany House, 1985, pp. 407-500; rev.ed., ed. Hank Hanegraaff, Minneapolis: Bethany, 1997, pp.517-608; rev.ed., ed. Ravi Zacharias, Bloomington: Bethany, 2003, pp. 535-627. = Early writings = From 1955 to 1965 Martin enjoyed a relationship with Zondervan publishers where he was appointed as director of cult apologetics publications. During this period Zondervan released several publications about cults under his direction, with at least eight books and four booklets written by Martin. His earliest countercult books included Jehovah of the Watchtower, The Christian Science Myth, The Christian and the Cults and The Maze of Mormonism.\\"Memorial Service for Dr. Walter Martin\\" Christian Research Newsletter, Volume 2, number 4 1989. In his first handbook, The Rise of the Cults, he labelled Jehovah's Witnesses, the Theosophical Society, Mormonism, Christian Science, the Unity School of Christianity, and Father Divine as cults, with an exhortation to the church to treat such as an important mission-field. Most of the contents of his earliest books reappeared in his major textbook The Kingdom of the Cults, which was first released in 1965. Martin's primary approach to assessing cults was to focus on what he saw as doctrinal issues, particularly those concerning the person, nature, and work of Jesus Christ. Martin emphasized research and quoted directly from the teachings of the opposing denominations; which he labelled cults, challenging their claims to Christianity by pointing out what he saw as Biblical errors in their theology. (Jill Martin Rische, eldest daughter of Dr. Walter Martin, www.waltermartin.com). Martin built a reputation as an authority figure on cults based upon integrity. His role as a columnist in Eternity magazine allowed him the freedom to address other topics such as basic Christian doctrines, the theology of Karl Barth, the problem of alcoholism, and reviewing books. His basic approach in apologetics was that of an evidentialist. Throughout his writing career Martin had articles published in other periodicals including Christianity Today, United Evangelical Action, The Christian Librarian, Christian Life, Christian Research Newsletter, Logos Journal, Moody Monthly, and Our Hope. = Christian Research Institute = In 1960 Martin established the Christian Research Institute in New Jersey, and then in 1974 relocated it to Southern California. In its earliest years Martin's colleagues who were associated with Christian Research Institute included Walter Bjorck, James Bjornstad, Floyd Hamilton,Floyd E. Hamilton, The Basis of Christian Faith, 4th Rev. Ed., New York: Harper & Row, 1964) and Shildes Johnson, many of whom went on to publish countercult books.For example, James Bjornstad, Twentieth Century Prophecy: Jeane Dixon, Edgar Cayce, Minneapolis: Bethany Fellowship, 1969; James Bjornstad, Counterfeits at Your Door, Glendale, California: Regal Books, 1979; James Bjornstad and Shildes Johnson, Stars, Signs and Salvation in the Age of Aquarius, Minneapolis: Bethany Fellowship, 1971. Through this para-church organisation Martin built up a reference library of primary source material, and sought to train Christians in the art of apologetics and evangelism. He developed a bureau of speakers, and from the early 1960s conceived of the need for a computerized data base of apologetic information.Walter R. Martin, \\"Christian Research Institute,\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 14, number 1 October 1970, pp. 15-18. Martin's prescient advocacy of using computer technology for apologetic purposes led to a major conference, the All-Europe Conference on Computer Technique for Theological Research held in Austria in September 1968. This became the subject of the book Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ, which was written by Martin's friend and colleague John Warwick Montgomery.John Warwick Montgomery, Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ, Wayne, New Jersey: Christian Research Institute, 1969.Walter R. Martin, \\"SENT/EAST: Electronic Answering Search Technology,\\" The Christian Librarian, Volume 14, number 1 October 1970, pp. 3-6. In 1978 he established a ministry periodical known as Forward, which was redesigned in 1987 as Christian Research Journal. Martin mentored several figures who have become prominent apologists in the Christian countercult movement including Craig Hawkins, Bob and Gretchen Passantino, Elliot Miller, John Weldon, Kenneth Samples, Ron Rhodes, Rich Poll, Ron Carlson, Paul Carden, and Robert M Bowman Jr. Many of the people who have established ministries in the Christian countercult movement regard Martin as the father of the Christian Counter-cult Movement.Tim Stafford, \\"The Kingdom of the Cult Watchers,\\" Christianity Today, 7 October 1991, p. 21. One indicator of the high esteem in which he was held is that at least twelve books have been dedicated to him. Scores of ministries on cults and apologetics have also begun as a result of Dr. Martin and his ministry. = Broadcaster, debater and lecturer = Martin was also a radio broadcaster who began this side of his ministry on Barnhouse's program. In the mid-1960s Martin regularly appeared as a guest panelist on The Long John Nebel Show, and then founded his own program known as \\"The Bible Answer Man.\\" Between the mid-1960s until his death in 1989 Martin debated in public various non-Christians such as atheist author/activist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and Hugh Schonfield, theologians of Liberal Christianity like Thomas J. J. Altizer and Bishop John Shelby Spong, and new religious commentators like Roy Masters. He appeared many times on the John Ankerberg television show debating advocates of Freemasonry, the Baha ºi Faith, and other groups. In the earliest years of his ministry Martin traveled frequently with Billy Graham and World Vision Founder Bob Pierce, addressing thousands in open air church meetings about the theological problems posed by the cults. Martin always emphasized the importance of analysis and primary source materials in determining the true beliefs of groups like Christian Science, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Mormonism, Spiritualists, Father Divine, Unity School of Christianity and Herbert W. Armstrong's Worldwide Church of God. In 1958 he spoke throughout East Asia and in Ghana, and in 1961 in Northern and Western Europe.Martin, Kingdom of the Cults, 1965 ed., p. 324. The popularity of Martin's ministry coincided with the Jesus People movement of the early 1970s and the rise of the countercultural interest in East Asian religions and esoteric pathways. As occult interests surfaced in the counterculture, and also as other religious movements and groups like the Hare Krishna, Unification Church, and Children of God emerged, Martin became a much sought after speaker for curious and fearful Christians.Quebedeaux, Worldly Evangelicals, p. 67. Martin utilised the new technology of cassette tapes, and disseminated many of his public lectures about apologetics questions and cultic groups to thousands worldwide. Several albums were released on The World of the Cults, The World of the Occult, The New Cults, How To Witness to Jehovah's Witnesses, and How to Witness to Mormons. Other albums tackled general apologetics To Every Man An Answer, and topical problems such as abortion, homosexuality and women's liberation (Martin Speaks Out). He later appeared in a series of six films produced by Vision House called Martin Speaks Out on the Cults. During the 1980s Martin spoke in churches and para- church conferences in Australia and around the world,W. A. van Leen, \\"Author in Australia\\", Take A Closer Look, Volume 5, number 4, June‚ÄìJuly 1984, p.5. Brazil, Kenya and New Zealand. His final book dealt with New Age spirituality.Walter R. Martin, The New Age Cult, Minneapolis: Bethany House, 1989. Martin maintained a part-time role as a lecturer in various liberal arts and bible colleges including The King's College, Melodyland School of Theology in Anaheim, California, and was for many years a board member of Gordon- Conwell Theological Seminary. In 1980 he joined John Warwick Montgomery in promoting apologetics through the Master of Arts program at the Simon Greenleaf School of Law.John Warwick Montgomery, \\"Foreword\\" in Engaging the Closed Mind, Dan Story, Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1999, p. 5  Controversies  In the 1980s, Martin was involved in critical debates over the positive confession success theology (also called Word of Faith) of Christian charismatic teachers such as Kenneth Copeland and Kenneth Hagin.Walter R. Martin, \\"Ye Shall Be As Gods\\" in The Agony of Deceit, ed. Michael Horton, Chicago: Moody Press, 1990, pp. 89-105. While Martin was critical of these teachers' claims concerning their views of Christ, healing, faith, and prosperity, he believed in the perpetuity of charismatic spiritual gifts in the Church. To that end, Martin presented his positive appraisal of spiritual gifts in several audio lectures (waltermartin.com), and by editing with chapter end-notes, a fresh reprint edition of 19th century evangelist Dwight L. Moody's book Secret Power. Some opponents have made claims that Martin did not have a valid doctorate. Mr and Mrs Robert Brown of Arizona, two Mormons, have stated that California Western University, now known as California Coast University (CCU) was not accredited at the time the degree was awarded. In addition some opponents of Martin claim he purchased his doctorate from CCU, which they claim was a degree mill. It must be noted that Martin completed all the coursework at New York University, which is also an accredited school. Furthermore, California Coast University also offers fully accredited programmes,Bear's Guide, 10th Edition, p. 85 being approved by the State of California since 1974. Such approval is currently granted by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. It, however, received national accreditation only in 2005, from the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC).

The first class was held on 27 October 1924 with only 6 students. By 1939, it had 110 students from 21 nationalities, but was forced to close due to World War II. The original school structures were destroyed during the bombing of Yokohama in World War II. After the war, the school was reopened in 1955 on its original site. The school continued to expand in both facilities and enrolment through the 1960s and 1970s, and initiated its first International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme from 1986. It became fully accredited in 1991 by the European Council of International Schools (ECIS) and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). Presently, the school has a student body of over 700 comprising over 50 nationalities and faculty and staff of over 100 spanning 15 nationalities.

He held the powerful post of British Resident to the Mughal court at Delhi. Biography =Background= David Ochterlony was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the eldest son of Captain David Ochterlony (also Ochterloney) and his wife, Katherine Tyler.Major & Murden. A Georgian Heroine: The Intriguing Life of Rachel Charlotte Williams Biggs His father was born into an ancient family in Forfarshire, Scotland, and his mother was born in Boston to settlers of English and Welsh descent. His mother was the niece of Sir William Pepperrell. He had two younger brothers, Gilbert and Alexander, and a sister, Catherine. Captain Ochterlony died in the Saint Vincent, West Indies, in 1765, after which his widow moved back to England and his mother remarried to Sir Isaac Heard, Garter King-of-Arms. He attended the Boston Latin School and Dummer Charity School (now known as The Governor's Academy) in nearby Byfield, Massachusetts. =Career in India= In 1777, at age 18, Ochterlony went as a cadet to India. In February 1778 he was commissioned into the Bengal Native Infantry as an ensign and that same September was advanced to lieutenant.J. J. Higginbotham, Men Whom India Has Known: Biographies of Eminent Indian Characters, Higginbotham and Company, 1874, p.338 In June 1782 whilst serving in the Second Anglo-Mysore War he was wounded and taken prisoner. He remained in captivity for the duration of the war, and was only released when peace resumed in 1784.J. J. Higginbotham, Men Whom India Has Known: Biographies of Eminent Indian Characters, Higginbotham and Company, 1874, p.338 He thereafter returned to Kolkata, and in recognition of his eminent service during the war was conferred with the appointment of Judge Advocate-General for one of the divisions in the army.J. J. Higginbotham, Men Whom India Has Known: Biographies of Eminent Indian Characters, Higginbotham and Company, 1874, p.338 In 1796 he was promoted to Captain and in 1800 to Major. In early 1803, he was appointed Lieutenant General and accompanied Lord Lake throughout the Second Anglo-Maratha War. He was present at the battles of Koil, Aligarh and Delhi. Following the battle of Delhi he was appointed Resident at Delhi. In 1804, he defended the city with a very inadequate force against an attack by Yashwantrao Holkar which earned him the highest approbation from the Commander-in-Chief. He was thereafter given the command at Allahabad and then commanded a force on the banks of the Sutlej to check the expansion of the Sikhs. He was promoted to Major-general in 1814. On the outbreak of the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1814 he was given the command of one of four converging columns. His was regarded as the only truly successful column throughout the war.J. J. Higginbotham, Men Whom India Has Known: Biographies of Eminent Indian Characters, Higginbotham and Company, 1874, p.338 He was subsequently promoted to the command of the main force in its advance on Kathmandu, and outmaneuvered the Gurkhas by a flank march at the Kourea Ghat Pass, brought the war to a successful conclusion and obtained the signature of the Treaty of Sugauli, which dictated the subsequent relations of the British with Nepal. In return for his services during the war, he became a Knight Commander of the Bath, the first time the honor had been conferred on an officer of the British military in India, and was granted a baronetcy in November 1815. Endnote: See Major Ross of Bladensburg, The Marquess of Hastings (\\"Rulers of India\\" series) (1893). The following month he was given a pension of ¬£1,000 per annum. In December 1816 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. In 1818 he was appointed Resident in Rajpootana, with which the Residency at Delhi was subsequently combined. In the Pindari War between 1818-19 he commanded the Rajputana column and made a separate agreement with Amir Khan. He detached him from the Pindaris, and then, interposing his own force between the two main divisions of the enemy, brought the war to an end without an engagement. He was afterwards made Resident and Political Agent of Malwa, thus having the entire superintendency of the affairs of central India.J. J. Higginbotham, Men Whom India Has Known: Biographies of Eminent Indian Characters, Higginbotham and Company, 1874, p.338 During this period he encountered and engaged in an ongoing personal feud with James Tod, which was based most likely on the power politics within the hierarchy of the East India Company. =Death= When Durjan Sal revolted in 1825 against Balwant Singh, the infant Raja of the Princely state of Bharatpur, Ochterlony acting on his own accord supported the young Raja by proclamation and ordered out a force to support him. However, the Governor- General of India, Lord Amherst, repudiated these proceedings and ordered the army to return. Ochterlony, who was bitterly chagrined by this rebuff, resigned his office, and retired to Delhi. He was to be replaced by his good friend Sir Charles Metcalfe. The feeling that the confidence which his length of service merited had not been given him by the governor-general is said to have accelerated his death, and he died at Meerut in July 1825. He is interred in St. John's Church in Meerut. The Ochterlony column at Calcutta commemorated his name, though it has since been rededicated. Private life Watercolor by an anonymous Delhi artist of Sir David Ochterlony in Indian dress smoking a hookah ca. 1820s As the official British Resident at Delhi, David Ochterlony adopted and thoroughly embraced Indo-Persian culture of Mughals. He was reputed to have thirteen Indian concubines (as seen by the British) or wives (as seen by others). Every evening, he used to take all thirteen of his wives on a promenade around the walls of the Red Fort, each on the back of her own elephant.William Dalrymple, The Last Mughal, p. 49 Mubarak Begum The most prominent among Ochterlony's women was Bebee Mahruttun Mubarak ul Nissa Begum, Nicknamed \\"Generallee Begum\\", she was Ochterlony's favorite and the mother of his youngest children. As such, she took clear precedence over the rest of the household. She was considered to be a devout Muslim, having once applied for leave to make the hajj to Mecca. Although much younger than Ochterlony, Mubarak was seen as the dominant personality in the relationship. This led one observer to remark that \\"making Sir David the Commissioner of Delhi was the same as making Generallee Begum\\". Another observer remarked that \\"Ochterlony's mistress is the mistress now of everyone within the walls. As a result of her influence, Ochterlony considered raising his children as Muslims, and when his two daughters by Mubarak Begum had grown up, he adopted a child from the family of the Nawabs of Loharu, one of the leading Muslim families of Delhi. Raised by Mubarak, the girl went on to marry her cousin, a nephew of the famous Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib.William Dalrymple, The Last Mughal, p. 66 Mubarak even seems to have set herself up as a power in her own right, and even formed her own independent foreign policy. At one point, it was reported that \\"Mubarak Begum, alias Generalee Begum, fills the [Delhi] papers with accounts of the Nizars and Khiluts [gifts and dresses of honor] given and taken by her in her transactions with the Vacquils [ambassadors of the different Indian powers] - an extraordinary liberty, if true.\\"Gardner papers, National Army Museum, Letter 87, p. 226, 10 August 1821 However, in spite of all her power and high status, Mubarak Begum was widely unpopular among the British and the Mughals alike. She offended the British by calling herself \\"Lady Ochterlony\\" and on the other hand, also offended the Mughals by awarding herself the title \\"Qudsia Begum\\", a title previously reserved for the Emperor's mother. After Ochterlony's death, she inherited Mubarak Bagh, an Anglo-Mughal garden tomb Ochterlony had built in the north of Old Delhi, but her intense unpopularity combined with her background as a dancing girl ensured that no Mughal gentleman would use her structure. To this date, the tomb is still referred to by the local inhabitants of the old city as the \\"Rundi ki Masjid\\" (the Whore's Mosque).William Dalrymple, White Mughals, pp. 183-184 Descendants Shaheed Minar, Kolkata, built as a memorial to Sir David Ochterlony. Ochterlony had at least six natural (illegitimate) children, by two or more of his concubines: # Roderick Peregrine Ochterlony, of Delhi (1785-d by 1823), his only son; he married 1808 Sarah Nelly, the daughter of Lt.

He was the mentor of Doctor Strange and was his predecessor as Sorcerer Supreme. The character was voiced by Michael Ansara in the 1978 television film Dr. Strange. Tilda Swinton portrayed a female Celtic version of the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Doctor Strange (2016) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Publication history The Ancient One first appeared in Strange Tales #110 (cover-dated July 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The character has appeared in multiple Marvel Comics graphic novels. Doctor Strange: Season One (January 2, 2012, by Greg Pak and illustrated by Emma Rios), Doctor Strange - Marvel Masterworks Volume 1, and Doctor Strange: From the Marvel Vault #1 (June 15, 2011, by Roger Stern and illustrated by Neil Vokes). Fictional character biography The character who would eventually become the Ancient One was born in Kamar-Taj, \\"a hidden land high in the Himalayas\\", more than 500 years ago. He spent his youth as a peaceful farmer, until his friend Kaluu discovered the power of magic.\\"The Origin of the Ancient One!\\" p. 3 When Kaluu shared this knowledge of the mystic arts with the Ancient One, the two disagreed on how they would use the powers. The Ancient One wished to turn their village into a utopia, while Kaluu desired power and conquest over nearby villages. The Ancient One and Kaluu agreed to cast a spell, eliminating sickness, disease, and age from Kamar-Taj. Subsequently, the villagers, under Kaluu's mind-control spell, crown him king of the village. The Ancient One attempts to stop Kaluu, but the village of Kamar-Taj is wiped out as a result of their conflict.\\"The Origin of the Ancient One!\\" p. 10 As a result, Kaluu is banished to an alternate dimension and the Ancient One is stripped of his immortality. Nonetheless, the Ancient One ages far more slowly than any regular human.Strange Tales #111 =Acquiring knowledge= Introduction of the Ancient One's native home, the \\"hidden land\\" of Kamar-Taj, identified only as in the Himalaya mountains. Strange Tales #148 (Sept. 1966). Script by Denny O'Neil, art by Bill Everett. The Ancient One settles in the Himalaya Mountains and builds a palace as his home, together with an order of monks that he forms for his own protection and support. In a tournament organized by the sorcerer Aged Genghis, the Ancient One wins the title of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme and subsequently takes on responsibility for a student, who later becomes Mister Jip. The student is then banished from the Ancient One's home when the student is discovered by his master to have been studying forbidden books of black magic to increase his own power.Strange Tales vol. 3 #11 =Taking an apprentice= As he ages and weakens, the Ancient One seeks out another student and eventually approaches Anthony Ludgate Druid, a psychiatrist with mystical talents. Posing as the High Lama, the Ancient One trains Druid to become Doctor Druid.Avengers Spotlight #37 After a car crash, Stephen Strange seeks assistance from the Ancient One to cure the nerve damage in his hands, only to angrily refuse when offered to be the Ancient One's apprentice instead. The Ancient One then accepts Strange as a student when Strange discovers Mordo and Dormammu had become collaborators and that Mordo had perpetrated an attack against the Ancient One. Unaware of the Ancient One's awareness of the threat against him, Strange confronts Mordo about his treachery only to be bound by restraining spells to prevent him from warning the Ancient One or physically attacking Mordo. Alarmed at these developments and concerned for the old man's safety, Strange concludes that the only way to help him would be to learn magic himself to gain a hope of stopping Mordo. When Strange is driven by this selfless purpose, he approaches the Ancient One to accept his offer. The pleased mentor promptly frees Strange from his restraints and explains the whole situation. Mordo leaves the palace shortly afterwards and Stephen becomes the Ancient One's successor under the name Doctor Strange.Strange Tales vol. 1 #115 The Ancient One often assists Strange. But when the extra- dimensional monster Shuma-Gorath tries to invade Earth through the Ancient One's mind while the latter is in the Crypts of Kaa-U, the Ancient One prompts Strange to destroy the portion of the Ancient One's mind in which the ego, or sense of self, exists. While such action blocks the way for Shuma-Gorath, trapping him within the Ancient One's mind, the Ancient One's physical body is also destroyed. The Ancient One's corporeal existence is over, but his soul subsequently achieves transcendence, becoming one with the universe and Eternity. Strange then inherits the Ancient One's title as Sorcerer Supreme.Marvel Premiere #8-10 The Ancient One demonstrates his existence following the death of his physical body by manifesting himself as an avatar of Eternity, intervening in a struggle between Doctor Strange and Eternity.Doctor Strange vol. 2 #12-13 He also briefly regains his corporeal form, during which time he lives as an alcohol-dependent derelict in the Bowery section of Manhattan, New York, United States. He resumed his oneness with the universe upon Doctor Strange's defeat of the Creators.Strange Tales vol. 2 #26-28 =The next life= During Hercules' journey to the underworld in the Dark Reign storyline, the Ancient One was seen in Erebus gambling for his resurrection. As explained to Hercules, the afterlife has become a shambles, due to various entities not paying attention.Incredible Hercules #129 During a demonic invasion of New York via the Eye of Agamotto, Iron Fist finds himself transferred into a white void when he comes in contact with the Eye, resulting in a face-to-face confrontation with a form that appears to be the Ancient One; the form claims that both he and a currently-unidentified associate are responsible for the demonic invasion due to his anger at Strange's recent \\"failures\\".New Avengers vol. 2 #3 However, a casual comment by Spider-Man prompts Strange, Doctor Voodoo, and Daimon Hellstrom to realize that they are actually dealing with Agamotto himself, as the Ancient One's demands for the Eye defy everything that was previously told to Strange about how the Eye is passed from one sorcerer to another. After Doctor Strange defeats Daniel Drumm, using dark magic that does not control him, the Ancient One's spirit appears and speaks to Doctor Strange: The Ancient One appears as a teacher to multiple magical students in school started by Stephen Strange.Strange Academy #2-3 (2020) Powers and abilities The Ancient One possessed the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a vast number of effects and was able to tap into extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power, existing in dimensions tangential to those of the Earth, through the recitation of spells. The Ancient One was capable of astral projection, levitation, interdimensional teleportation, and a large number of other effects. However, in his extreme old age, the Ancient One was unable to perform any major feats of sorcery without placing great physical strain upon himself. The Ancient One also possessed a variety of mystical objects, such as the Book of the Vishanti, the Orb, Amulet, and Eye of Agamotto, and devices gathered throughout his lifetime. After he unified with Eternity, the extent of the Ancient One's powers ceased to be known. Other versions In J. Michael Straczynski's 2005 Strange series, Doctor Strange's origin was adapted. In this series, the Ancient One is an ancient magician physically frail from old age, but spiritually and psychically powerful. He is depicted as an old, bald man with a long white beard and moustache dressed in a white robe. In the Dr. Strange: Season One graphic novel, the Ancient One is presented as more sociable. He makes self-deprecating jokes and forms friendships with outsiders. In other media =Film= Live action Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One in Doctor Strange (2016) Tilda Swinton portrays the Ancient One in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character is depicted as an androgynous Celt, to reflect the mystery of the character. * Swinton first portrays The Ancient One in Doctor Strange (2016). Over the course of the film, the Ancient One is attacked by Kaecilius, a former student who has come to believe that the power of Dormammu and the Dark Dimension represents humanity's only hope for an immortal future. Strange also deduces that the Ancient One's immortality is the result of her drawing on the energy of the Dark Dimension, prompting Mordo to express disgust at her actions due to his inability to understand the need for compromise in a crisis. She is mortally wounded in battle with Kaecilius, but has one last conversation with Doctor Strange in astral form before she passes on, reflecting that Strange will succeed as a sorcerer once he has time to overcome his inner demons. *Swinton reprises her role as The Ancient One in Avengers: Endgame. Bruce Banner encounters her after time traveling to 2012 to retrieve the Time Stone. The Ancient One is shown protecting the New York Sanctum from Chitauri forces during the Battle for New York. Banner initially tries to take the Stone by force, but she pushes his soul into the astral plane, forcing him to explain the situation. She nevertheless refuses, fearing that the removal of the Time Stone from her timeline would cause chaos. When Banner reveals that Strange willingly gave the Stone to Thanos before perishing, she realizes that her giving the Stone to Banner is part of a bigger plan, and relents after Banner promises to return it and other stones back to their place in time after their mission is done. Animation The Ancient One appears in Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme, voiced by Michael Yama. =Television= * The Ancient One features prominently as an unseen entity in the finale of the unsuccessful series pilot/TV-movie, Dr. Strange (1978), voiced by Michael Ansara. * In the 1996 Spider-Man: The Animated Series episode \\"Doctor Strange\\", the Ancient One makes a non-speaking appearance in a flashback scene that details the origins of both Doctor Strange and Baron Mordo. =Video games= * The Ancient One is featured in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by James Sie. He is seen in a void within a blurry mirror in the Sanctum Sanctorum. The Ancient One has special dialogue with Doctor Strange and Deadpool (with the latter mistaking the Ancient One for his \\"Grampy\\"). During his special dialogue with the Ancient One, Doctor Strange informs him that the Masters of Evil have threatened the world. He then asks that the Ancient One watches over the superhero alliance and aids them in whatever way possible. The Ancient One tells Doctor Strange that he will be watching over the heroes. * The Ancient One appears as a playable character in Marvel: Future Fight.

Zorlu Holding is headquartered in Istanbul.  History  The Zorlu group was founded by Hacƒ± Mehmet Zorlu. Zorlu Holding acquired the aviation company Vestel in 1994. In December 2006, the most important stakeholders of the Zorlu family sold $250 million worth of their main controlling companies (Zorlu Linen Dokuma, Linens Pazarlama, Korteks, ...) back to the Zorlu Holding. The shares of Ahmet Zorlu and his family members in the Zorlu Holding lowered from 51% to 49%. Those changes came as the holding sought to consolidate its activities and turn to the international. In May 2011, the Zorlu Group selected the luxury hotel brand Raffles as the premium hospitality provider of the Zorlu Center, Turkey‚Äôs first mixed-use project. In September 2016, the group was in talk with the Iranian authorities to build gas-fired power plants in Iran. In November 2017, the Zorlu Group opened Turkey's first nickel and cobalt production facility, and Europe's first global-scale smartphone manufacturing plant. In February 2018, the Zorlu Group signed a $4.5 billion deal with the Chinese GSR Capital to invest in battery production through its subsidiary Vestel and with a plan to build a 25,000 mega-watt battery production factory on a 300,000 square meter area (which would provide batteries for 500,000 cars). Through this deal, GSR Capital took 50% of Meta Nikel Madencilik, a nickel production subsidiary of the Zorlu Group. In March 2018, the management of the company announced preparing its business units for an eventual IPO. In November 2019, the Zorlu Group announced a $400-million investment to boost its production capacities, and the launch of domestic electric cars on the Turkish market by 2022.

They have five major clans, and are adjacent to other groups with similar cultures and languages.  Regional classification  The Shona people are divided into tribes in eastern and northern Zimbabwe. Their estimated population is 16.7 million: * Karanga or Southern Shona (about 8.5 million people) * Zezuru or Central Shona (5.2 million people) * Korekore or Northern Shona (1.7 million people) Other members or close relatives: * Manyika tribe or Eastern Shona (1.2 million)Ethnologue: Manyika in Zimbabwe (861,000) and Mozambique (173,000). Desmond Dale's basic Shona dictionary includes the Manyika dialect.D. Dale: * Basic English ‚Äì Shona dictionary, Afro Asiatic Languages Edition, Sept 5, 2000, * Duramazwi: A Shona - English Dictionary, Afro Asiatic Languages Edition, Sept 5, 2000, * NdauEthnologue: Ndau in Mozambique (1,580,000) and Zimbabwe (800,000). Their dialect, partially mutually intelligible with the main Shona dialects, has click sounds which do not occur in standard Shona. Ndau has a wealth of Nguni words as a result of the Gaza Nguni occupation of their ancestral land in the 19th century.  Language and identity  When the term \\"Shona\\" was created during the early-19th-century Mfecane (possibly by the Ndebele king Mzilikazi), it was used as a pejorative for non-Nguni people; there was no awareness of a common identity by the tribes and peoples which make up the present-day Shona. The Shona people of the Zimbabwe highlands, however, retained a vivid memory of the ancient kingdom often identified with the Kingdom of Mutapa. The terms \\"Karanga\\", \\"Kalanga\\" and \\"Kalaka\\", now the names of discrete groups, seem to have been used for all Shona before the Mfecane.Zimbabwes rich totem strong families ‚Äì a euphemistic view on the totem system Ethnologue notes that the language of the Bakalanga is mutually intelligible with the main dialects of Karanga and other Bantu languages in central and eastern Africa, but counts them separately. The Kalanga and Karanga are believed to be one clan who built the Mapungubwe, Great Zimbabwe and Khami, and were assimilated by the Zezuru. Although many Karanga and Kalanga words are interchangeable, Kalanga is different from Zezuru. Dialect groups have many similarities. Although \\"standard\\" Shona is spoken throughout Zimbabwe, the dialects help identify a speaker's town (or village) and ethnic group. Each Shona dialect is specific to a certain ethnic group. In 1931, during his attempt to reconcile the dialects into a single standard Shona language, Clement DokeDoke, Clement M.,A Comparative Study in Shona Phonetics. 1931. University of Witwatersrand Press, Johannesburg. identified five groups and subdivisions: # The Korekore (or Northern Shona), including TaœÖara, Shangwe, Korekore, GoœÖa, Budya, the Korekore of Urungwe, the Korekore of Sipolilo, Tande, Nyongwe of \\"Darwin\\", and Pfungwe of Mrewa # The Zezuru group, including Shawasha, HaraœÖa, another GoœÖa, Nohwe, Hera, Njanja, Mbire, Nobvu, Vakwachikwakwa, Vakwazvimba, Tsunga # The Karanga group, including Duma, Jena, Mari, GoœÖera, NogoœÖa, and Nyubi # The Manyika group, including Hungwe, Manyika themselves, TeœÖe, Unyama, Karombe, Nyamuka, Bunji, Domba, Nyatwe, Guta, Bvumba, Here, Jindwi, and Boca # The Ndau group (mostly in Mozambique), including Ndau, Garwe, Danda, and Shanga Dialects developed during the dispersion of tribes across Zimbabwe over a long period, and the influx of immigrants into the country from bordering countries has contributed to the variety. History During the 11th century, the Kalanga people formed kingdoms on the Zimbabwe plateau. Construction began on Great Zimbabwe, capital of the kingdom of Zimbabwe. The Torwa dynasty ruled the kingdom of Butua, and the kingdom of Mutapa preceded the Rozvi Empire (which lasted into the 19th century). Brother succeeded brother in the dynasties, leading to civil wars which were exploited by the Portuguese during the 16th century. The kings ruled a number of chiefs, sub-chiefs and headmen. The kingdoms were replaced by new groups who moved onto the plateau. The Ndebele destroyed the Rozvi Empire during the 1830s; the Portuguese slowly eroded the kingdom of Mutapa, which extended to the Mozambique coast after it provided valued exports (particularly gold) for Swahili, Arab and East Asian traders. The British destroyed traditional power in 1890 and colonized the plateau of Rhodesia in 1890, and the Portuguese colonial government in Mozambique fought the remnants of the kingdom of Mutapa until 1902.  Culture  = Subsistence agriculture and mining= Shona farms near Murewa, Zimbabwe The Shona have traditionally practiced subsistence agriculture. They grew sorghum (largely replaced by maize), beans (since the middle of the first millennium AD), African groundnuts, and (beginning in the 16th century) pumpkins. Sorghum and maize are used to prepare the main dish, a thickened porridge called sadza, and the traditional beer known as hwahwa.Correct spelling according to D. Dale, A basic English Shona Dictionary, mambo Press, Gwelo (Gweru) 1981; some sources write \\"whawha\\", misled by conventions of English words like \\"what\\". The Shona also keep cattle and goats, since livestock are an important food reserve during droughts.David N. Beach: The Shona and Zimbabwe 900‚Äì1850. Heinemann, London 1980 und Mambo Press, Gwelo 1980, . Precolonial Shona states derived substantial revenue from the export of mining products, particularly gold and copper. = Housing = Traditional Shona housing, known as musha, are round huts arranged around a cleared yard (ruvanze). Each hut has a specific function, such as a kitchen or a lounging space.Friedrich Du Toit, Musha: the Shona concept of home, Zimbabwe Pub. House, 1982 = Arts =  Sculpture  The Shona are known for their stone sculptures, which were discovered during the 1940s. Shona sculpture developed during the eleventh century and peaked in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries before beginning a slow decline until their mid-20th-century rediscovery. Although most of the sculptures are sedimentary-stone (such as soapstone) birds or humans, some are made with harder stone such as serpentinite and the rarer verdite. During the 1950s, Zimbabwean artists began carving stone sculptures for sale to European art lovers. The sculptures quickly became popular, and were bought and exhibited by art museums worldwide. Many of the sculptures depict the transformation of spirits into animals (or vice versa), and some are abstract. Many Zimbabwean artists carve wood and stone for sale to tourists, and traditional pottery also exists.  Clothing  Traditional textile production was high-quality, but expensive; the Shona preferred wearing skins or imported fabrics.  Music  Mbiras Shona traditional music, like other African traditional music, has constant melodies and variable rhythms. Its most important instruments are ngoma drums and the mbira. The drums vary in size and shape, depending on the type of music they are accompanying. The way in which they are played depends on the size of a drum and the type of music. Although large drums are typically played with sticks and smaller drums with an open palm, the small drum used for the amabhiza dance is played with a hand and a stick; the stick rubs, or scratches, the drum to produce a screeching sound. The mbira has become a national instrument of sorts in Zimbabwe. It has a number of variants, including the nhare, mbira dzavadzimu, the Mbira Nyunga Nyunga, njari mbira and matepe. The mbira is played at religious and secular gatherings, and the different mbiras have different purposes. The 22‚Äì24-key mbira dzavadzimu is used to summon spirits, and the 15-key Mbira Nyunga Nyunga is taught from primary school to university. Shona music also uses percussion instruments such as the marimba (similar to a xylophone), hosho (shakers), leg rattles, wooden clappers (makwa) and the chikorodzi, a notched stick played with another stick.  Religion  n'anga, close to Great Zimbabwe Although sixty to eighty percent of the Shona people are Christians, traditional beliefs remain. According to Shona tradition, the afterlife is not another world (like the Christian heaven and hell) but another form of existence in this world. The Shona attitude towards dead ancestors is very similar to their attitude towards living parents and grandparents.Michael Gelfand, The spiritual beliefs of the Shona, Mambo Press 1982, , with a preface by Father M. Hannan. The Bira ceremony, which often lasts all night, summons ancestral spirits for guidance and help. In Zimbabwe, totems (mutupo) have been used by the Shona people since their culture developed. Totems identify clans, and up to 25 totems have been identified. Similar totems exist among the South African Tswana, Zulu, Northern Ndebele and Herero.Totem Author: Magelah Peter - Published: May 21, 2007, 4:56 am The totem system is problematic for orphans (especially abandoned babies), who may not have a totem.Orphan for Life Notable Shona People * Nehanda Charwe Nyakasikana * Nelson Chamisa * Dereck Chisora * Herbert Chitepo * Constantino Chiwenga * Stella Chiweshe * Phillip Chiyangwa * Tendai Mtwarira * Peter Ndoro * Khama Billiat * Knowledge Musona * Chartwell Dutiro * Danai Gurira * Tonderai Kasu * Thomas Mapfumo * Strive Masiyiwa * Paul Tangi Mhova Mkondo * Emmerson Mnangagwa * Oliver Mtukudzi * Grace Mugabe * Robert Mugabe * Joice Mujuru * Solomon Mujuru * Solomon Mutswairo * Jah Prayzah * Shingai Shoniwa * Rekayi Tangwena * George Tawengwa * Tererai Trent * Morgan Tsvangirai * Winky D * Emmanuel Makandiwa * Simbarashe Milton Kambarami *Tapiwa G.

He also broadcast for many years on BBC Radio Medway, BBC Radio Kent and Invicta Sound in Kent, and latterly on PrimeTime and Saga DAB radio. On PrimeTime he introduced the late night slot, In Mellow Mood, until the station's demise in 2006. He was also the regular matchday announcer for Fulham Football Club, in the mid-1970s and for Gillingham Football Club, in Kent during the 1980s. Early years Don's father served in the British Army during the Second World War and died in a Japanese prisoner of war camp in 1945. His family moved to England soon afterwards. When the young Don arrived in London as a six-year-old, he had a broad Glaswegian accent. Don was educated at the Henry Thornton Grammar School in Clapham. His first job was with the Jack Hylton Entertainment Organisation and he also worked on various local newspapers in London before becoming a junior reporter for the Sunday Citizen. A keen sportsman in his younger days, he was London table tennis champion for two years and also enjoyed boxing, cycling, running and water polo. First Broadcasts Don first broadcast to the nation in 1955 at the age of sixteen as co-host of The Younger Generation on the BBC Light Programme having answered an ad in the Radio Times. He contributed to the network for several years before being called up for national service. On his return in 1962, he married his longtime sweetheart Yvonne, whom he had known for eight years. In 1966 he signed up with the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), where his encyclopaedic knowledge of sport kept him in demand as a broadcast anchor and commentator for international boxing and football matches. It also took him across the globe including to Aden (now Yemen) in 1966/67, to Cologne in Germany (1968‚Äì69 and again for part of '72) and then to Gibraltar for three years. In 1972, Don was assigned as a BFBS reporter for the Munich Olympics, where he secured a worldwide scoop ‚Äì an exclusive interview with the swimmer Mark Spitz, who'd won an ‚Äì unprecedented at the time ‚Äì seven gold medals at the Games. Don was also press officer and matchday announcer for Fulham F.C. in the mid-1970s when George Best and Bobby Moore were in the team. BBC Radio 2 Don returned to the BBC in 1974, joining the Light Programme's successor Radio 2 as a continuity announcer and newsreader, his first BBC staff job. He soon became a regular cover presenter, hosting such iconic shows as Two-Way Family Favourites, Friday Night is Music Night, Saturday Night with the BBC Radio Orchestra, Night Ride, Band Parade, Music Through Midnight and Sport on 2, and was also a regular cover presenter, stepping into the shoes of Terry Wogan, Jimmy Young, Ed Stewart, David Hamilton, Charlie Chester and late John Dunn. Work in Kent Don joined Radio Medway in 1979 and was with the station when it relaunched as BBC Radio Kent in July 1983. In October 1984, he was part of the launch team for Kent's very first commercial radio station, Invicta Sound (now Heart, Kent), where he hosted a mid morning music and chat programme. Invicta Sound's 'debate and discussion' launch format was famously unsuccessful and most of the early presenters found themselves out of work when the schedule was revamped less than a year later. Don returned to BBC Radio Kent for the rest of the '80s and early '90s as presenter of the popular nostalgia music show, Remember When, and also hosted the Sunday morning breakfast shows which included his popular topical chats with Canon Clifford Pollard (deceased), who was Director of Education for the Diocese of Canterbury at the time. Always a crowd puller, Don hosted a series of stage shows for the BBC at the Kent County Show and was one of the main anchors of BBC Radio Kent's marathon six-hour live fund-raising Children in Need broadcasts, as well as being match day announcer at Gillingham F.C. for most of the '80s. Digital age Don pursued his broadcasting career in Malta in the early '90s where he also married his second wife Cheryl, returning to Britain, to the beautiful county of Kent, as he referred to his adopted home, in 1997. It was from there that he relaunched his UK broadcasting career, tossing out the gramophone decks and needles to embrace the digital broadcasting age, and was soon back behind the microphone at Channel Travel Radio in Folkestone giving out cross channel information to motorists on the M20. A stint as weekend newsreader for London talk station LBC followed, before he joined the new over fifties digital service PrimeTime RadioPrimeTime Radio where he presented the late night slot, In Mellow Mood. He also presented shows for Primetime's digital sister station, Saga DAB radio and for Saga 106.6 FM in the East Midlands and Saga 105.7 FM in the West Midlands, all of which were recorded in Saga Digital's west London studios. When Primetime and Saga ceased broadcasting in 2006, Don emigrated to Estepona on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain. His final radio stop was with REM FM (now Talk Radio Europe),where, from May 2007, he presented weekend shows with a mix of music, chat and celebrity guests as diverse as the entertainer Max Bygraves and the jazz loving politician Ken Clarke. Death Durbridge died in Spain on 9 June 2012. He is survived by his first wife, Yvonne, and also leaves a daughter, Moira, and a grandson, Teddy.

Career The Mighty Clouds of Joy was formed in 1959 in Los Angeles, CA as a traditional-based style group. It wasn't until 1961 as the group became famous, they added base,drums and keyboards to the standard guitar backup and developed a funky sound that split the difference between gospel, and rhythm and blues. In a break with tradition, the groups sound incorporated Soul, R&B;, and Rock; all of which flourishes into their musical mix (one of their early hits was produced by Gamble and Huff) without diluting the essential religious essence of their material. Unlike other gospel groups, its members dressed stylishly ‚Äî they used the same tailor as the Temptations ‚Äî and worked slick choreography into their act. Thus not realizing they were setting a standard and paving a way for future gospel soul groups for decades to come. They became one of the most influential gospel groups in the US. The long- lived group flourished throughout the rest of the 20th century, scoring numerous Grammy Awards and nominations, as well as several hit albums along the way. The mighty Clouds of Joy developed a fan base much like the soul Pop and R&B; groups. They can even be found on display in the famous Apollo Theater. Based in Los Angeles, California, the original group members include Joe Ligon (d. 2016), Johnny Martin (d. 1987), Ermant Franklin Jr., Artis Turnbough (d. 1999), Elmo Franklin (d. 2008), Richard Wallace (d. 2020), Leon Polk(d. 1998) and David Walker (who also recorded several tracks with Link Wray under the name Bunker Hill).

Brown (born August 1937) is a young Earth creationist, who is the director of his own ministry called the Center for Scientific Creation. The Skeptic's Dictionary considers him to be one of the leaders of the creation science movement. He proposes a specific version of flood geology called the Hydroplate Theory. He is a retired army officer with a degree in mechanical engineering.  Biography  Brown has a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a B.S. from West Point and he served as an officer in the United States military until he retired in 1980.\\"About the Author,\\" Center for Scientific Creation, In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood (7th ed.) (online edition). Accessed 27 December 2007. Since retiring from the military, Brown has been the director of his \\"Center for Scientific Creation\\" and has done his own research, writing, and speaking on origins theory. In 1998, Brown was appointed to a committee reviewing Arizona's state science standards. Evolution was retained in the Arizona state science standards after a final decision in August 1998.Evolution education now added to state high school standards, Jayson Peters Arizona State University State Press, Aug. 25, 1998 Creationist Theory In Brown's In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood he suggests evidence against evolution and for creation science and flood geology (including hydroplates). It is divided into three sections, the first of which explores discoveries made by scientists that do not fit the theory of evolution.CreationScience.com5. Natural Selection The second section outlines various alternate explanations to geological and astronomical subjects such as the mid-oceanic ridge and comets, which Brown states evolutionary science cannot explain. The final section presents a variety of other questions encountered in the creation‚Äìevolution controversy. In 1989, the Creation/Evolution journal of the National Center for Science Education published a critique of Brown's theory. Jim Lippard, graduate student of philosophy begins with a criticism focusing primarily on fossil evidence of human evolution. Brown addressed several of Lippard's points in his response, and three further articles were printed: Lippard, Brown, and ending with Lippard, where he asserts that Brown made serious errors, including using \\"mistaken claims about what others have written.\\" The series of articles does not discuss Brown's hydroplates, apart from Brown's claim that Lippard \\"dismisses or ignores the bulk of the book and specifically addresses only a very small fraction of its substance.\\" Robert T. Pennock has described Brown's position as being typical, other than the unique feature of his hydroplates hypothesis, of young-earth creationist's explaining all major terrestrial features in terms of a catastrophic Biblical flood. =Hydroplate Theory= The most distinctive feature of Brown's theories, compared to other creationist theories, are the hydroplates. He claims that, prior to the Flood of Noah, there was an enormous amount of water underneath the crust of the Earth, and that this water pressurizing, shattering the crust, and breaking it into plates was both part of the Flood and created the continental plates that mainstream geology associates with plate tectonics. Because the plates are, in this theory, formed by the action of water, he calls them \\"hydroplates\\" and gives their name to the theory.

She achieved renown as a translator of Pierre Corneille's Pomp√©e and Horace, and for her editions of poetry after her death. She was highly regarded by many writers of 17th century literature, including John Dryden and John Keats, as being influential. Early years Born in London, Katherine Philips was daughter of John Fowler, a Presbyterian cloth merchant of Bucklersbury, near the river in the City of London, and of Katherine Oxenbridge, whose father worked in the medical profession. Philips, it seems, had a strong memory and was intellectually advanced, and was, according to a cousin of hers, able to read the Bible before the age of four. Additionally, she acquired remarkable fluency in several languages. After her father's death, she moved to Wales with her newly married mother. She attended boarding school from 1640 to 1645 where she began to write verse within a circle of friends and to appreciate French romances and Cavalier plays from which she would later choose many of the pet names she gave to members of her Society of Friendship. This school, run by a Mrs Salmon, was in Hackney, a hotbed of female education at the time. Philips also broke with Presbyterian traditions, in both religion and politics, by becoming a member of the Church of England, as well as an ardent admirer of the king and his policy. In 1647, when she was sixteen, Katherine Fowler married Welsh Parliamentarian James Philipps. James Philips' age has been the subject of some dispute, as he was long thought to be 54 years old on their wedding day, thus making him 38 years Katherine's senior. However, it seems their recovered marriage certificate has since shown that James Philips was actually only 24 years old at the time of their union. The couple had two children, including a son named Hector who did not live past infancy. He was buried in London in 1655. Hector's death was the subject of some of Philips' later poems, such as \\"Epitaph on Hector Philips\\" and \\"On the Death of my First and Dearest Childe.\\" Life and career Engraving of a bust of Catherine Philips The Society of Friendship had its origins in the cult of Neoplatonic love imported from the continent in the 1630s by Charles I's French wife, Henrietta Maria. Members adopted pseudonyms drawn from French pastoral romances of Cavalier dramas. Philips dramatised in her Society of Friendship the ideals, as well as the realities and tribulations, of Platonic love. Thus the Society helped establish a literary standard for her generation and Orinda herself as a model for the female writers who followed her. Her home at the Priory, Cardigan, Wales became the centre of the Society of Friendship, the members of which were known to one another by pastoral names: Philips was \\"Orinda\\", her husband \\"Antenor\\", and Sir Charles Cotterel \\"Poliarchus\\". \\"The Matchless Orinda\\", as her admirers called her, was regarded as the apostle of female friendship, and inspired great respect. She was widely considered an exemplar of the ideal woman writer: virtuous, proper, and chaste. She was frequently contrasted to the more daring Aphra Behn, to the latter's detriment. Her poems, frequently occasional, typically celebrate the refined pleasures of platonic love. Jeremy Taylor in 1659 dedicated to her his Discourse on the Nature, Offices and Measures of Friendship, and Cowley, Henry Vaughan the Silurist, the Earl of Roscommon and the Earl of Cork and Orrery all celebrated her talent. A page from a manuscript copy of Philips' poetry, c. 1670. In 1662 she went to Dublin to pursue her husband's claim to certain Irish estates, which, due to her late father's past monetary investments in the British military, they were in danger of losing. There she completed a translation of Pierre Corneille's Pomp√©e, produced with great success in 1663 in the Smock Alley Theatre, and printed in the same year both in Dublin and London, under the title Pompey. Although other women had translated or written dramas, her translation of Pomp√©e broke new ground as the first rhymed version of a French tragedy in English and the first English play written by a woman to be performed on the professional stage. In 1664, an edition of her poetry entitled Poems by the Incomparable Mrs. K.P. was published; this was an unauthorised edition that made several grievous errors.Elizabeth Hageman, 'Treacherous Accidents and the Abominable Printing of Katherine Philips's 1664 Poems', New Ways of Looking at Old Texts, III, 2004. Page 85. In March 1664, Philips travelled to London with a nearly completed translation of Corneille's Horace, but died of smallpox. She was buried in the church of St Benet Sherehog, later destroyed in the Great Fire of London. Reception and legacy After her death, in 1667 an authorised edition of her poetry was printed entitled Poems by the Most Deservedly Admired Mrs. Katherine Philips, the Matchless Orinda. The edition included her translations of Pomp√©e and Horace. Edward Phillips, nephew of John Milton, placed Katherine Philips high above Aphra Behn, writing in Theatrum poetarum (1675), a list of the chief poets of all ages and countries, that she was \\"the most applauded...Poetess of our Nation\\". The literary atmosphere of her circle is preserved in the excellent Letters of Orinda to Poliarchus, published by Bernard Lintot in 1705 and 1709. Poliarchus (Sir Charles Cotterell) was master of the ceremonies at the court of the Restoration, and afterwards translated the romances of La Calpren√®de. Philips had two children, one of whom, Katharine, became the wife of a \\"Lewis Wogan\\" of Boulston, Pembrokeshire. According to Gosse, Philips may have been the author of a volume of Female Poems ... written by Ephelia, which are in the style of Orinda, though other scholars have not embraced this attribution. Philips's translations and poems consider questions of political authority and express her royalist beliefs. Her work also considers the nature and value of friendship between women. There has been speculation over whether her work could be described as lesbian. Certainly her representations of female friendship are intense, even passionate. She herself always insisted on their platonic nature and characterises her relationships as the \\"meeting of souls,\\" as in these lines from \\"To my Excellent Lucasia, on our Friendship\\": > For as a watch by art is wound To motion, such was mine; But never had > Orinda found A soul till she found thine; Which now inspires, cures, and > supplies, And guides my darkened breast; For thou art all that I can prize, > My joy, my life, my rest. (9‚Äì16) Harriette Andreadis has argued that 'her manipulations of the conventions of male poetic discourse constitute a form of lesbian writing.'Harriette Andreadis, 'The Sapphic-Platonics of Katherine Philips, 1632‚Äì1664', Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 1989. Volume 15, number 1, page 59. However, there are many critics who do not believe Philips's poetry is indicative of her sexuality. For example, in discussing \\"To the Excellent Lucasia\\" Mark Llewellyn argues that the image portrayed by the speaker is \\"stripped of all sensual appetite, could become the pathway to apprehension of, and eventually mystic union with, divine love and beauty\\" (447). Andreadis says, \\"friendship here is no less than the mingling of souls, the intimacy of hearts joined in secret and holding each other's secrets, sublimely elevating the friends to such ecstasies that they pity the mundane pleasures and powers of worldly rulers\\" (529). Upon the Double Murder of King Charles is a more politically minded piece than many of her others from this time period, although she is often associated with a class of poets termed Royalist or Cavalier poets, noting their political sympathy to the Royalist cause, those who supported the monarchy of King Charles I of England during the English Civil War and the following English Interregnum.\\"Royalist and Cavalier Poetry.\\" The Broadview Anthology of British literature. Vol 2. Ed. Don LePan, et al. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2006.790. Print.  Influences  She inspired the figure of \\"Orinda\\", elderly widow, hypersensitive to matters of love, and she herself a victim of love (albeit platonic) for a woman, in the Italian tragedy of 1671 Il Cromuele (Cromwell) written by Girolamo Graziani, set in England during the Civil War.  Premiere of Pompey  On 10 February 1663 Philips premiered her adaptation of the French verse tragedy, Pierre Corneille's, Pomp√©e at Smock Alley. The opening night was notable for its political undertones, as well as having the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the audience. It also had theatre goers of all classes in attendance. Some Catholic, loyal to the monarchy after the war and desiring to acquire their lands back for their families. Others in the audience were Protestant and felt entitled to these same lands based on the promises made to them. Due to Ireland's tense political climate, the theatre was a welcomed escape from these politically complicated Catholic/Protestant relations, following the English Civil War and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The play opened with a direct heroic couplet suggesting the idea of two rivals finding a successful compromise: > \\"The mighty Rivals, whose destructive Rage Did the whole World in Civil Arms > engage, Are now agreed, and make it both their Choice, To have their Fates > determin'd by your Voice.\\" The original speaker on opening night failed to mention specific details to the play which are in the script in this opening, allowing the audience to assume the text could be directed at the current political affairs. There are rumours that Phillips was either in the audience, or could have even been an actress in the play herself.  Sexuality  There has been speculation among critics over Katherine Philips' sexuality, specifically in regards to the relationships she shared with some of her female friends. Literary critics have often highlighted suggestions of female intimacy and eroticism within Philips' work. In fact, many of her poems were written for or about fellow Society of Friendship members Anne Owen and Mary Aubrey, who went by the names of Lucasia and Rosania, respectively. A series of letters exchanged by Philips and her friend Sir Charles Cotterell between 6 December 1661 and 17 May 1664 were recovered and published in 1705, under the title Letters from Orinda to Poliarchus. Hints of Philips' affection for Owen can be found throughout this correspondence, notably within an exchange referring to Philips' attempt to convince Owen to marry Sir Charles in order to keep her nearby, as Owen was engaged at the time and planned to move to Dublin with one Marcus Trevor. This attempt would ultimately prove unsuccessful.  References  = Citations = = Sources = * * \\"Philips, Katherine\\". The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature. Claire Buck, ed.

He was the son of Ali Muddat ibn al-Husayn. He was born in the Dar al-Taj Palace at La Marsa. On 14 January 1928 he became the Bey al-Mahalla (crown prince) of Tunis, and thus the lieutenant-general of the Beylical Army, and became bey upon the death of his cousin Muhammad VI al-Habib. International Eucharistic Congress A year after his accession, in May 1930, an International Eucharistic Congress was convened in Carthage to celebrate the centenary of the French conquest of Algeria. It was the first such congress held in Africa, and the first in a Muslim-majority country. Ahmed Bey reluctantly agreed to serve as Honorary President of the Congress, which was partly paid for with 2 million francs worth of funds from the Tunisian government, raised in taxes on Tunisia's Muslim population. The event, with some participants dressed as Crusaders and others using it as a platform for speeches hostile to Islam, caused a furore in the Tunisian national movement. The nationalist newspaper La Voix du Tunisien ('The Tunisian Voice') called on the Bey to resign his Honorary Presidency and for other officials to dissociate themselves from the event and members of the Destour Party claimed that the Bey's involvement demonstrated his subservience to the French and abandonment of the defence of his people's interests.David Motadel, Islam and the European Empires OUP 2014 p.90Kenneth Perkins, A History of Modern Tunisia, Cambridge University Press, 2014 p.96 Vichy and the Jews of Tunisia In 1940 the new Vichy regime in France led to the appointment of a new Resident General, Admiral Jean-Pierre Esteva who began pressing Ahmed Bey to implement Vichy anti-Jewish legislation.http://www.shjt.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Les-Juifs-de- Tunisie-face-%C3%A0-Vichy-et-aux-pers%C3%A9cutions-allemandes.pdf p.206 accessed 2/5/2017 Article 9 of the French law of 3 October 1940 decreed that the anti-Jewish laws were applicable in the protectorate territories of the French Republic, including Tunisia.https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Loi_du_3_octobre_1940_portant_statut_des_Juifs The Bey made very limited efforts to resist these demands, Abdelaziz Barrouhi, 'Moncef Bey, les juifs, l‚ÄôAxe et les Alli√©s', Jeune Afrique, 13 August 2006 [archive]accessed 2/5/2017 but eventually signed a decree on 3 October 1940, which excluded Jews from the civil service and from professional roles connected to press, radio, theatre and cinema, while also allowing the publication of a 'Journal isra√©lite de Tunisie' (Jewish Newspaper of Tunisia').Paul Sebag, Histoire des Juifs de Tunisie : des origines √† nos jours, √©d.

The floods were especially catastrophic in Flanders, Zeeland and Holland.The area in Zeeland and Flanders had been flooded 29 years earlier, on 8 October 1375. As a result of the floods, the Braakman was created or enlarged. In this new area, new parishes and villages started to appear. The flood in 1404 destroyed the area again, just as it had done in 1375. Other areas previously untouched such as the small towns of IJzendijke and Hugevliet were engulfed and destroyed during the flood. When the flood occurred many were killed and homes destroyed due to the poor warnings. On 19 November 1404, large areas of Flanders, Zeeland, and Holland, were flooded. The storm tide responsible became known as the First Saint Elizabeth's flood. The damage was catastrophic. The area of Zeeland- Flanders had already been flooded 20 years earlier, in 1375. Through this, the Zuiderzee was created. Around the Zuiderzee, polders were diked, and within these polders, new parishes arose. Unfortunately, in 1404, everything was destroyed again. This time, a complete spit that was home to a number of small towns such as Ijzendijke and Hugevliet, which were spared in 1375, was engulfed during the flood. In the county of Flanders all the coast islands in the mouth of the Westerschelde were washed away. After this calamity John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (Jan zonder Vrees) gave the command to link all the dikes already existing into one large dike which ran from the north from the county to the south. This explains why the Belgian coast line is so straight. Since Jan zonder Vrees was also count of Flanders, this dike is still named .

Her most successful US hit single, \\"Trouble-Maker\\", spent two weeks at No. 1. From 1975 until 1983, she also performed as a backing vocalist with Thelma Houston and on a number of Donna Summer albums. Career Prior to releases in the US through composer Giorgio Moroder's Oasis record label during the 1970s, Kelly recorded a single in Germany entitled \\"Kung Fu Is Back Again\\" (1974), released on Atlantic and produced by the songwriter-producer Pete Bellotte alongside Moroder. In 1975 she released the single \\"Love Power\\" a cover version of a 1967 hit by The Sandpebbles, written by Teddy Vann, and later made famous as part of the repertoire of Luther Vandross. The single was backed with \\"Drifter\\", never included in any album and an example of the pre- disco Moroder-Bellotte production, similar to Donna Summer's \\"Lady of the night\\" material. In April 1976, Kelly turned to disco with the single \\"Trouble-Maker\\" and released an album by the same name. The album contained five tracks, including an extended version of \\"Love Power\\". In 1977, she released Zodiac Lady, a controversial album that Casablanca Records, during the disco heyday, refused at first to release. Imports from Italy swamped the international dance floors, creating a hit for the title track and songs such as \\"Love Sign\\". This album spawned a twelve-inch single, \\"Zodiacs,\\" which had major club and radio play. \\"Funky Stardust\\", \\"Love Sign\\" and \\"I‚Äôm Sagittarius\\" were released from that album, in addition to \\"Zodiacs\\" itself in different countries. \\"Zodiacs\\" peaked at No. 24 in the US Hot Dance/Club Play chart in 1977, and at No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart in 1978. \\"Love Sign\\" was released as a single in Italy only. Both \\"Trouble-Maker\\" and \\"Zodiac Lady\\" were produced by Moroder and Bellotte. Gettin' The Spirit, followed in March 1978. Produced by Giorgio Moroder and Bob Esty, it was an album consisting of gospel songs, performed in the disco style. The album featured dance versions of the Edwin Hawkins penned, \\"Oh Happy Day\\" and \\"To My Father's House,\\" with both songs released on one single. \\"Gettin' The Spirit\\" was also released with a disco version of \\"My Sweet Lord\\". It peaked at No. 9 on the US Hot Dance/Club Play chart in 1978. When Pope John Paul II succeeded John Paul I in 1978, Kelly released the single \\"John Paul II\\", The single never made it onto an album, but the B-side \\"Tribute to Love\\" did in the late 1980 release, Roots Can Be Anywhere. By this time, Kelly was no longer with Casablanca Records. Two singles were released: \\"Kabacka Shaka\\" and \\"Roots Can Be Anywhere\\", but the album had limited success also due to poor distribution. It was also released as ‚ÄúThis is Roberta Kelly‚Äù with a longer version of Kabacka Shaka‚Äù and without ‚ÄúCoconut Rock‚Äù. It was produced by Michael Holm. In 1981, Kelly released the album, Tell Me, through Baby Records in Italy, featuring \\"Patty Cake\\", produced by J√ºrgen Koppers. It was a last attempt to revive disco. After that, Kelly's next release was not until 1995, when she issued The Sound of Color and \\"Jubilee in Germany,\\" celebrating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. During the summer of 2008, Kelly resurfaced with the single, \\"America (The Sound of Colour Realized)\\".

Other datings are usually earlier rather than later. when the village of Ruthwell, now in Scotland, was part of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria. It is the most famous and elaborate Anglo-Saxon monumental sculpture,Wilson, 72. and possibly contains the oldest surviving text, predating any manuscripts containing Old English poetry.This depends on the date allocated to the cross itself, and also the runic inscriptions, which may be later (see below). The earliest English manuscripts containing poetry are two versions of Bede that contain C√¶dmon's Hymn, and are dated to the 8th century: the Moore Bede and Saint Petersburg Bede. The Franks Casket, usually ascribed to the early 8th century, may be similar in age to the Ruthwell Cross. It has been described by Nikolaus Pevsner thus; \\"The crosses of Bewcastle and Ruthwell ... are the greatest achievement of their date in the whole of Europe.\\"Pevsner ‚Äì Introduction. The cross was smashed by Presbyterian iconoclasts in 1642, and the pieces left in the churchyard until they were restored and re-erected in the manse garden in 1823 by Henry Duncan. In 1887 it was moved into its current location inside Ruthwell church, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, when the apse which holds it was specially built.Information boards, Ruthwell Church. It was designated a scheduled monument in 1921, but had this removed in 2018. Description The washing of Christ's feet, south side. Top of the south face Anglo-Saxon crosses are closely related to the contemporary Irish high crosses, and both are part of the Insular art tradition. The Ruthwell cross features the largest figurative reliefs found on any surviving Anglo-Saxon cross‚Äîwhich are virtually the largest surviving Anglo-Saxon reliefs of any sort‚Äîand has inscriptions in both Latin and, unusually for a Christian monument, the runic alphabet, the latter containing lines similar to lines 39‚Äì64 of Dream of the Rood, an Old English poem, which were possibly added at a later date. It is high. The two main sides of the cross (north and south) feature figurative relief carvings, now considerably worn, that depict Christ and several other figures; their subjects and interpretation have been much discussed by art historians, and the cross continues to be \\"one of the most extensive and most studied of all surviving visual programs of the early Middle Ages.\\"Farr, 45. It is clear to most scholars that the images and texts each form part of a sophisticated and unified programme, \\"almost an academician's monument,\\" though a number of different schemes have been proposed, and some suggest the runic inscription may have been added later. The largest panel on the cross (north side) shows either Christ treading on the beasts, a subject especially popular with the Anglo-Saxons, or its rare pacific variant Christ as Judge recognised by the beasts in the desert,See discussion at Christ treading on the beasts. as suggested by the unique Latin inscription surrounding the panel: \\"IHS XPS iudex aequitatis; bestiae et dracones cognoverunt in deserto salvatorem mundi\\" ‚Äì \\"Jesus Christ: the judge of righteousness: the beasts and dragons recognised in the desert the saviour of the world.\\" Whatever the subject, it is clearly the same as the very similar relief that is the largest panel on the nearby Bewcastle Cross which, subject to dating, was probably created by the same artists. Below this is Saints Paul and Antony breaking bread in the desert, another rare scene identified by an inscription (\\"Sanctus Paulus et Antonius duo eremitae fregerunt panem in deserto\\"), then either a Flight into Egypt or perhaps a Return from Egypt, and at the bottom a scene too worn to decipher, which may have been a Nativity of Christ.Raw, and Wilson, 72. On the south side is Mary Magdalene drying the feet of Christ, which is bordered by the longest Latin inscription on the cross: \\"Attulit alabastrum unguenti et stans retro secus pedes eius lacrimis coepit rigare pedes eius et capillis capitas sui tergebat\\" ‚Äì see Luke 7:37‚Äì38 and John 12:3.Raw, Schapiro, 163. Below this is the Healing of the man born blind from John 9:1, inscribed: \\"Et praeteriens vidit hominem caecum a natibitate et sanavit eum ab infirmitate,\\" the Annunciation (\\"Et ingressus angelus ad eam dixit ave gratia plena dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus\\" ‚Äì ‚ÄúAnd an angel came to her saying, ‚ÄúHail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you amongst women.‚Äù‚Äù-- Luke 1:28) and the Crucifixion, which on stylistic grounds is considered to have been added at a considerably later period. These scenes are on the main, lower, section of the shaft, which was broken above the largest scenes, and possibly the two sections were not restored the right way round. Above the large scene on the north side is either John the Baptist holding a lamb, or possibly God the Father holding the Lamb of God, who opens a book as in Apocalypse 5:1‚Äì10.Raw. Above this (and another break) are two remaining figures of the Four Evangelists with their symbols that originally were on the four arms of the cross-head: St. Matthew on the lowest arm, and St. John the Evangelist on the top arm. The side arms and centre roundel of the cross are replacements, of purely speculative (and most improbable) design. On the south side, Martha and Mary (with inscription) are followed by an archer, the subject of almost as much debate as the judging Christ, on the lowest arm of the Cross, and an eagle on the top arm.Raw, Schapiro, 177‚Äì186 on the archer, to which he gives a purely secular, decorative meaning. Destruction and restoration It escaped injury at the time of general destruction during the Reformation in the sixteenth century, but in 1640 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland ordered the \\"many idolatrous monuments erected and made for religious worship\\" to be \\"taken down, demolished, and destroyed.\\" It was not until two years later, however, that the cross was taken down when an Act was passed \\"anent the Idolatrous Monuments in Ruthwell.\\"It has usually been assumed that this was the Ruthwell Cross, but this cannot be known with certainty. See √ì Carrag√°in, Ritual and the Rood, 15. The usual account is that the cross was taken down in the church or churchyard soon after the 1642 order and broken up. One piece, it appears, was used as a bench to sit upon. The pieces were later removed from the church and left out in the churchyard. By 1823, Henry Duncan had collected all the pieces he could find, and put them together, commissioning a new crossbeam (the original was lost), and having gaps filled in with small pieces of stone. He then erected it in the manse garden. Duncan's restoration is questionable. He was convinced that he was reconstructing a \\"Popish\\" (Roman Catholic) monument, and based his work on \\"drawings of similar Popish relics.\\" Duncan dismissed the rare early medieval motif of Paul and Anthony breaking bread in the desert as probably \\"founded on some Popish tradition.\\" Cross or pillar It has been suggested that the work was not in fact originally a cross. In a 2008 journal article, Patrick W. Conner wrote that he would not call the structure a cross: \\"Fred Orton has argued persuasively that the lower stone on which the runic poem is found may, indeed, never have belonged to a standing cross, or if it did, that cannot be asserted with confidence now. For that reason, I shall refer throughout to the Ruthwell Monument in preference to the Ruthwell Cross.\\"Conner, 26 footnote 2. In his 1998 essay, ‚ÄúRethinking the Ruthwell Monument: Fragments and Critique; Tradition and History; Tongues and Sockets,‚Äù scholar Fred Orton discusses a note Reginald Bainbrigg wrote to William Camden in 1600 for possible publication in any new edition of his 1586 Britannia: ‚ÄúBainbrigg saw a ‚Äòcolumn‚Äô which he referred to as a ‚Äòcross,‚Äô‚Äù Orton said of the note.Orton, 83. Orton is also convinced the piece is made of two different types of stone: ‚Äú... it seems to make more sense to see the Ruthwell monument as originally a column ... amended with the addition of a Crucifixion scene, and then ... further amended with the addition of a cross made of a different kind of stone.\\"Orton, 88. Runic inscription Drawing of the runic inscription (Dream of the Rood interpretation) Translation of Ruthwell Cross Inscription. At each side of the vine-tracery runic inscriptions are carved. The runes were first described around 1600, and Reginald Bainbrigg of Appleby recorded the inscription for the Britannia of William Camden. Around 1832, the runes were recognized as different from the Scandinavian futhark (categorized as Anglo- Saxon runes) by Thorleif Repp, by reference to the Exeter Book. His rendition referred to a place called the vale of Ashlafr, compensation for injury, a font and a monastery of Therfuse. John Mitchell Kemble in 1840 advanced a reading referring to Mary Magdalene. The better known Dream of the Rood interpretation is due to a revised reading of Kemble's in an 1842 article. The inscription along the top and left side is read as: : ·õ£·ö±·õÅ·õã·õè ·öπ·ö´·õã ·ö©·öæ ·ö±·ö©·õû·õÅ ·öª·öπ·õñ·ö¶·ö±·ö® / ·ö¶·õñ·ö± ·ö†·ö¢·õã·ö® ·ö†·õ†·ö±·ö±·ö™·öæ ·õ£·öπ·ö©·õó·ö¢ / ·ö®·ö¶·ö¶·õÅ·õö·ö® ·õè·õÅ·õö ·ö™·öæ·ö¢·õó / ·õÅ·ö≥ ·ö¶·ö®·õè ·ö™·õö ·õí·õÅ·öª : Krist w√¶s on rodi. Hwe√ær√¶ / √æer fus√¶ fearran kwomu / √¶√æ√æil√¶ til anum / ic √æ√¶t al bih[eald]. : \\"Christ was on the cross. And there hastening from far came they to the noble prince. I beheld all that.\\" Kemble's revised reading is based on the poem of the Vercelli Book, to the extent that missing words in each are supplied from the other. Kemble himself notes how the inscription may be \\"corrected\\" with the help of the Vercelli Book. The inscription on the left side is read: :Mith strelum giwundad alegdun hi√¶ hin√¶ limwoerign√¶ gistoddun him : \\"With missiles wounded, they laid him down limb-weary, they stood by him\\" The manuscript text reads: :Crƒ´st w√¶s on r≈çde. Hw√¶√∞ere √æ«£r f≈´se‚Å†feorran cw≈çman t≈ç √æƒÅm √Ü√∞elinge; ic √æ√¶t eall behƒìold. [...] mid str«£lum forwundod. ƒÄlƒìdon hƒ´e √∞«£r limwƒìrigne,‚Å† gest≈çdon him √¶t his lƒ´ces hƒìafdum The interpretation is disputed and may be a conjecture inserted by Kemble himself: O'Neill (2005) notes Kemble's \\"almost pathological dislike of Scandinavian interference in what he sees as the English domain.\\" Many believe that the runes, as opposed to the Latin inscriptions, were added later, possibly as late as the 10th century. Conner agrees with Paul Meyvaert's conclusion that the runic poem dates from after the period in which the monument was created.Conner, 34. He says Meyvaert has ‚Äúsatisfactorily explained‚Äù that the layout of the runes suggest ‚Äúthat the stone was already standing when the decision to add the runic poem was made.‚Äù The runic inscription on the monument is not a ‚Äúformulaic‚Äù memorial text of the kind usually carved in Old English on stone. Rather, Conner sees the content of the runic addition to the monument as related to prayers used in the adoration of the cross first composed in the tenth century.Conner, 43‚Äì51. He therefore concludes that the poem was developed in the 10th century ‚Äì well after the creation of the monument. Recent scholarship The \\"Visionary Cross project\\", led by Catherine Karkov, Daniel Paul O‚ÄôDonnell, and Roberto Rosselli Del Turco, studies crosses such as the Ruthwell Cross, the Bewcastle Cross, and the Brussels Cross, and in 2012 performed 3D-scans at Ruthwell. =Gallery= Ruthwell Cross, North Face, Figure of Christ II.jpgChrist as judge, with two animals, north side Ruthwell Cross 20100924 Paul and Anthony.jpgPaul and Anthony sharing food in the desert, north side Ruthwell Cross - South face.jpg Overall view of the south side Ruthwell Cross - west face.jpg Vine scrolls and creatures on the west side Ruthwell Cross, between 1823 and 1887.jpgWhen outside in the 19th century See also *Nith Bridge cross *Easby Cross in the Victoria and Albert Museum, with Bewcastle and Ruthwell the best preserved Northumbrian cross * Scheduled monuments in Dumfries and Galloway Notes References * *Farr, Carol A., Woman as sign in Early Anglo-Saxon Monasticism, in The Insular Tradition, SUNY series in medieval studies, Eds: Catherine E.

Whitehead was purchased by the Navy on 17 October 1861 at New York City from D. B. Martin, and commissioned on 19 November 1861, Acting Master Charles A. French in command. Service history =North Carolina blockade, 1862= The following day, Whitehead reached Hampton Roads and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She sailed for the North Carolina coast on 28 December 1861 and arrived at Hatteras Inlet on 4 January 1862. During the next few months, the steamer Whitehead carried out extensive operations against Confederate vessels and shore installations in the sounds and rivers of North Carolina. On 7-8 February, she helped to capture Roanoke Island. On 10 February, Whitehead took schooner M. C. Etheridge on the Pasquotank River. On 10 April, she made prizes of schooners Comet and J. J. Crittendon and of sloop America in Newbegun Creek. Together with the , , and , Whitehead blocked the mouth of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal with fill on 23-24 April. She captured schooner Eugenia in Bennett's Creek on 20 May and took Ella D off Keel's Creek two days later. Late in September, Whitehead briefly left North Carolina waters to participate in a Federal assault upon Confederate forces gathered at Franklin, Virginia. On 3 October, , and Whitehead entered the Blackwater River and fired on Rebel troops for over six hours before a barricade placed across the channel necessitated retreat. One of Whitehead's sailors, Ordinary Seaman Edwin Smith, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during this engagement. Whitehead soon returned to Pamlico Sound but was ordered north on 16 November 1862 for repairs at the Washington Navy Yard. At this time, 3-inch iron plate was placed over her guns and around her pilot house. Back in fighting trim, Whitehead returned to North Carolina late in December 1862. =River campaign, 1863= Her first noteworthy action came early in the spring of 1863 when she helped to lift the Confederate siege of Washington, North Carolina, which lasted from 31 March to 16 April. On 6-7 July, Whitehead, Commodore Perry, and bombarded and occupied Williamston, North Carolina. Whitehead captured several prisoners during an expedition up the Pasquotank River on 14 August 1863 and destroyed a Confederate corn mill on the Roanoke River on 22 February 1864. On 1-2 March 1864, Whitehead and Southfield sailed up the Chowan River and freed USS Bombshell from her encirclement by Confederate shore batteries. =CSS Albemarle, 1864= Whitehead encountered the formidable Confederate ram CSS Albemarle on three occasions. In the early morning hours of 19 April 1864, , , Southfield and Whitehead engaged the ram in the Roanoke River. All received damage, and Southfield was sunk. Darkness prevented Whitehead from returning Albemarles fire. As a result of this costly Union naval defeat, Plymouth, North Carolina fell to Confederate troops the next day. Union vessels, including Whitehead, again fought Albemarle on 5 May 1864. This three-hour Battle of Albemarle Sound was inconclusive, and the ram withdrew up the Roanoke. Whitehead battled Albemarle a third time on 24 May 1864. A shell from Whitehead exploded near the ram's stern and caused the dreaded Confederate warship to withdraw. =Continuing the blockade, 1864-1865= Whitehead resumed routine patrol and reconnaissance duty soon after this. On 12 July 1864, she ascended the Scuppernong River to Columbia, North Carolina, and burned a bridge used to transport supplies to Southern troops at Plymouth. Whitehead and steamers Thomas Colyer and Massasoit joined in an expedition up the Chowan River on 28 July 1864, capturing steamer Arrow and a large quantity of cotton and tobacco on 29 July at Gatesville, North Carolina. Whitehead proceeded to the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs on 20 August 1864. She completed these in time for her to participate in the recapture of Plymouth on 31 October 1864. For the closing months of the Civil War, Whitehead, but for occasional runs to Norfolk, Virginia for supplies, patrolled the inland waters of North Carolina. She was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 June 1865 and was sold at public auction there on 10 August 1865. Re-documented as Nevada on 7 October 1865, the steamer remained in mercantile service until she was destroyed by fire on 1 September 1872 at New London, Connecticut.

Within the Seventh-day Adventist Church he was a controversial figure. He was dismissed from ministry in the Adventist church in 1980, following his critique of the church's investigative judgment teaching. He had since worked through the non-denominational evangelical ministry Good News Unlimited. Ford disagreed with some aspects of traditional Adventist end-time beliefs. However, he still defended a conservative view of scripture, the Seventh-day Sabbath, and a vegetarian lifestyle. He viewed the writings of Ellen G. White as useful devotionally, but not at the level of authority held by the Church.https://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/church/the- gift-of-prophecy/ Ford shared the sermon time at the Good News Unlimited congregation, which meets on Saturdays in the Brisbane suburb of Milton, and in periodic seminars on the eastern seaboard of Australia. Biography =Early life and conversion= Desmond Ford was born in Townsville, Queensland, Australia on 2 February 1929, to Wilfred Ford and Lillian Simpson. He had one brother, Val, who was three and a half years older. The Ford lineage consisted of farmers and cattlemen of English and Australian descent. The Simpson lineage derived from England, Ireland and China. Desmond's parents were nominal Anglican Christians, with his father almost an atheist in practice, and his mother presenting \\"a religious fa√ßade.\\" Wilfred encouraged his son to read, beginning a lifelong obsession for the \\"unusually gifted\\" boy.Milton Hook (2008). Desmond Ford: Reformist Theologian, Gospel Revivalist (Adventist Today), 9‚Äì10 When Lillian was pregnant with Desmond, an Adventist book salesman shared insights on nutrition with the family, sparking a chain of events affecting Desmond's life. At an Adventist camp meeting in 1939 Desmond was given a Bible, which he would complete 3 years later, around the time he finished primary school. However his parents divorced when he was nine; Wilfred moved to Canberra, and Lillian and the boys later moved to Sydney, New South Wales (NSW). He passed his Intermediate Certificate in 1943. However, due to the family's poverty and Australia's involvement in World War II, Desmond had to drop out of school. He became officially employed with Associated Newspapers at the age of 15, although he had started working there months earlier, and was promoted from copy boy to an editorial position, because of his published work. Meanwhile, Desmond took night classes for high school. All along, Desmond was being influenced by encounters with Adventists and other Christians, and steadily collected books on Christian theology, and the creation‚Äìevolution controversy.Hook, p11‚Äì16http://www.goodnewsunlimited.org.au/ See the brief biography on the Good News Unlimited website Ford was challenged by the strict lifestyle standards presented in Ellen G. White's Messages to Young People, and gave up the cinema and reading fiction. Reading novels had been his main childhood hobby, and became replaced with reading theology.Hook, p10 White's book The Great Controversy was a key influence on his conversion. In winter 1946 he publicly responded to a call for commitment to God's service. Ford was impressed by the Christian character of many of the Adventists who had nurtured him. In September he was officially baptised into the church. This was despite strong opposition from his brother; and his mother was also originally resistant to his conversion, having become disenchanted with the Adventist church herself. Ford resigned from his job, and returned briefly to Townsville with his family. He then left in 1947 for the Australasian Missionary College (nicknamed \\"Avondale\\", and later known as Avondale College) in the Lake Macquarie region of NSW, to train for the ministry.Hook, p17, 20‚Äì24. Desmond Ford, Physicians of the Soul (Nashville, Tennessee: Southern Publishing, 1980), p99‚Äì100, 105, 108 =Seminary= Ford found his time at Avondale an exciting for mental and spiritual growth. He was an active participant in class discussions, and occasionally taught classes to fill in for the lecturers. He was particularly inspired by Dr. William Murdoch, and carried out research for him. Ford gave talks in nearby churches, and published around a dozen articles for church magazines during this time. He also led students in Bible study. He struggled financially, and worked on Avondale's farm and elsewhere, and also selling Adventist books.Hook, p26‚Äì30 He graduated from the Ministerial Course in Avondale in 1950, with high marks.Hook p27, 32‚Äì36. =Early ministry= Ford lived in a caravan (trailer) with his mother, who insisted on accompanying him, while canvassing (selling Christian books). Ford was sent to help build a new church in the coastal town of Coffs Harbour, NSW. In 1951, still in his first year of service as a pastor, he was sent to Newcastle, NSW, then an industrial city, to assist evangelist George Burnside. While Burnside was a dynamic presenter, Ford's biographer Milton Hook describes him as a fundamentalist (see: historic Adventism), and draws an analogy with a rugged, gung-ho cowboy, like a John Wayne character. Ford questioned him on some end-times interpretations, resulting in conflict between the pair ‚Äì a sign of further things to come.Hook, p39‚Äì43Colin and Russell Standish, The Gathering Storm and the Storm Burst, p53 Later he sold books in the Lake Macquarie and nearby Upper Hunter regions, which he found challenging work.Hook, p46 He worked as a pastor in various churches and as an evangelist for about 7 years in NSW, in AustralianInterview with Desmond Ford by Adrian Zytkoskee in Spectrum 11:2 (November 1980), 53‚Äì61 rural towns. In 1952 Ford pastored the Coffs Harbour area, under a supervisor. His mother returned to Queensland. In December he married Gwen Booth, with whom he had shared a budding friendship and romance since their meeting at Avondale, where she studied teaching. Gwen had been raised in humble circumstances in Yass, and was a quiet achiever who cared about others, and had a deep faith in Jesus.See Hook, p30‚Äì32, 39-40, 47‚Äì49. Another source is Archibald Hefren, \\"Life Sketch of Gwen Ford\\". Australasian Record (25 May 1970), p14; cited in Hook, p37 The following year they moved to the country town of Quirindi, where Ford pastored the church. From 1954 to mid-1955, Ford pastored in the Gunnedah area, then moved north to Inverell.Hook, p50‚Äì51 There a public debate with Burgin, a Church of Christ minister and a \\"formidable opponent\\" of Adventists, brought Ford respect. The topic was the Sabbath, with the specific title \\"Is the Seventh Day or the First Day Binding on Christians?\\" Arguably Ford won the debate. He later baptised some of Burgin's church members.Hook, p51‚Äì54 =Return to Avondale= The South Pacific Division called him back to Avondale, to complete his ministry course. He completed a BA in 1958,\\"Ford, Desmond (1929- )\\" in Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists by Gary Land and went on to complete a Master's degree in systematic theology at the SDA Washington Seminary in 1959. Ford subsequently received a PhD in the rhetorical analysis of Paul's letters from Michigan State University in 1961. In the same year he returned to Australia and became head of the Religion Department at Avondale College, where he would remain until 1977.Reflections On Adventism: An Interview With Dr. Desmond Ford by Adventist Today Forum. Accessed 25 October 2007 At Avondale, Ford taught many classes, including public speaking, homiletics, and evangelism. He was a member of the Biblical Research Committee in Australia and the United States. He completed his second PhD in 1972 from the University of Manchester, while on leave from teaching at Avondale. His supervisor was the renowned Protestant theologian F. F. Bruce. His field was New Testament studies, specifically eschatology (end times). Ford entitled his thesis, The Abomination of Desolation in Biblical Eschatology. His main expertise has been biblical apocalyptic literature, such as Daniel and Revelation, and eschatology. =Tension over theology= Ford was a primary opponent of the perfectionism within the SDA church, especially its form as taught by fellow Australian Robert Brinsmead, a former classmate of Ford's at Avondale. Ford believed that victory over the guilt of sin (justification) was provided at the cross, victory over the power of sin (sanctification) is the work of a lifetime and victory over the presence of sin (glorification) occurs at the return of Christ Jesus. Ford disagreed with the belief of sinless perfection, and did not hold to the belief that the saints are sealed at the end time, but held that the final removal of sin occurred when mortality changes to immortality at the return of Jesus Christ. Ford held that victory over the presence of sin does not occur during this lifetime, so sin continues among the saints up to the return of Jesus Christ.Evangelicals And Adventists Together See Item # 4 in article Ford held that justification precedes sanctification, because victory over the guilt of sin, precedes victory over the power of sin. Ford taught that while justification is distinct from sanctification, the two concepts are always found together, in the same manner as two railway lines are distinct but never separate. Adventist belief places an equal emphasis on sanctification compared to justification, while still believing both are necessary for salvation. Ford disagreed strongly with the belief of \\"eschatological perfectionism,\\" which is the teaching that a final generation of believers must achieve a state of complete sinlessness (or Christlikeness) in the final period just before the second coming of Jesus, when the saints are sealed (see Last Generation Theology). Mainstream Adventists consider the life and character of Christ as a perfect example, that all must imitate. Ford stepped into the debate within Adventism concerning the nature of Jesus Christ, specifically whether Jesus Christ took on a fallen or an unfallen human nature in the Incarnation. This was precipitated by the publication of Questions on Doctrine in 1957, which some Adventists felt did not agree with what the church held.Questions on Doctrine, page 60,(The Desire of Ages, p.25), He \\"took upon Himself human nature\\" (The SDA Bible Commentary, vol.5, p.1128), He \\"took the nature of man\\" (The Desire of Ages, p.117), He took \\"our sinful nature\\" (Medical Ministry, p.181), He took \\"our fallen nature\\" (Special Instruction Relating to The Review and Herald Office, p. 13, 26 May 1896), He took \\"man's nature in its fallen condition\\" (Signs of the Times, 9 June 1898). The debate revolves around the interpretation of several biblical texts: :\\"For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh.\\" Romans 8:3 (ESV) :\\"For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\\" Hebrews 4:15 :\\"...concerning his Son (Jesus), who was descended from David according to the flesh...\\" Romans 1:3 (ESV) :\\"Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.\\" Hebrews 2:17 NKJV and statements made by Ellen White: :\\"Notwithstanding that the sins of a guilty world were laid upon Christ, notwithstanding the humiliation of taking upon Himself our fallen nature, the voice from heaven declared Him to be the Son of the Eternal.\\" The Desire of Ages, p. 112. :\\"He assumed human nature, with its infirmities, its liabilities, its temptations.\\" Manuscript Releases, Vol. 17, p. 337. :\\"But Jesus Christ was the only begotten Son of God. He took upon Himself human nature, and was tempted in all points as human nature is tempted. He could have sinned; He could have fallen, but not for one moment was there in Him an evil propensity.\\" Letter 8, 1895 in Manuscript Releases, Vol. 13, p. 18. :\\"Christ did not possess the same sinful, corrupt, fallen disloyalty we possess, for then He could not be a perfect offering.\\" Review & Herald, 25 April 1893 According to Adventist historian George Knight, most early Adventists (until 1950) believed that Jesus Christ was born with a human nature that was not only physically frail and subject to temptation, but that he also had the fallen predisposition and inclination to sin.Questions on Doctrine, annotated edition, 2005. Since 1950, the \\"historic\\" wing of the church continues to hold this fallen view of Christ's human nature. Mainstream Adventist hold to the belief taught by Ellen WhiteThe Signs of the Times, 29 May 1901. that He came with the effects of Adam's sin deep within his nature, that Christ took on the fallen nature but not the sinfulness of man. In contrast to the \\"historic\\" view, Ford believed that Ellen White was clear that Christ took our infirmities and with the weaknesses of fallen man, the sinful nature in the sense of that he had a lessened capacity with respect to the fallen physical nature that he inherited from Adam, including physical weaknesses, frailties and mental, and moral degeneracy and deterioration.QOD Assumed Liabilities of Human Nature pp. 653-654The Review and Herald, 28 July 1874. While Christ was tempted as all other human beings are, Ford noted that the lessened capacity of his human nature did not ever include giving in to temptation or having any evil desires or propensity or predisposition towards sin in his spiritual nature, a position with which Ellen White taught and mainstream Adventists agree.Ellen White on the Nature of Christ by Denis Fortin. =Original Sin= According to Anglican Geoffrey Paxton, during the 1960s scholars such as Ford and Edward Heppenstall began to try to highlight a shift in the concept of original sin within the SDA church, away from its foundational belief that Seventh-day Adventists do not believe in original sin.Pain and Progress: The 1960s, chapter of The Shaking of Adventism by Geoffrey J. Paxton Seventh-day Adventists have historically preached a doctrine of inherited weakness, but not a doctrine of inherited guilt.E. G. White, Signs of the Times, 29 August 1892 Ellen White and others such as George Storrs, and Uriah Smith were disposed to de-emphasise the corrupt nature inherited from Adam, instead stressing the importance of actual, personal sins committed by the individual. Adventists traditionally understand sins of commission as the transgression of God's law, either wilfully or in ignorance. They base their belief on texts such as \\"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\\" (1 John 3:4)Are We Born Saved or Lost? See quote in article \\"Willful choice makes one a sinner (1 John 3:4; Isaiah 59:2).\\" Progressive Adventists add to this with some form of original sin.Original Sin =Robert Brinsmead & debate= Ford in turning Brinsmead from his belief in sinless perfection, urged Brinsmead to study the Reformers. As a result, Brinsmead ultimately rejected perfectionism. Around 1970, there was a major controversy amongst Australian Adventists over whether \\"righteousness by faith\\" included both justification and sanctification. This had been sparked by Brinsmead, and Ford became caught up in it. Tensions over Ford and the theology teaching at Avondale more generally, led to a meeting of Australian church leaders on 3‚Äì4 February 1976 to hear accusations by a group of \\"Concerned Brethren\\". Ford's understanding of righteousness by faith was the main issue,\\"Advance and Retreat: The 1970s\\" chapter in The Shaking of Adventism while the report mentions \\"the Sanctuary, the Age of the Earth and Inspiration.\\"\\"Church Growth Experiments in Secular Australia\\" by E.

The quote is from the official report, as reprinted in Price's chapter In April a group of church leaders and theologians, including Ford met in Palmdale, California, to discuss the meaning of righteousness by faith. Ford was the \\"center of attention.\\" The resulting document was titled the \\"Palmdale Statement\\".Adventisarchives.org\\".Adventists: Heirs of the Reformation, chapter 1 of The Shaking of Adventism by Geoffrey J. Paxton =Move to United States= In response to criticisms of his theology, in 1977 the church moved him to the United States, where he taught Religion at Pacific Union College for three years.L. R. Tarling, The Edges of Seventh-day Adventism (Bermagui South: Galilee, 1981), 215-16; D. Ford, \\"The Historical Background of the Crisis,\\" in D. & G. Ford, The Adventist Crisis of Spiritual Identity (Newcastle, Cal.: Desmond Ford Publications, 1982), 23. The classes he taught included the life and teachings of Christ, the Pauline epistles, Christian apologetics, Daniel and Revelation, the major and minor prophets of the Old Testament, introduction to theology, and biblical theology. =Increasing tensions with church leadership= In October 1979 Ford was invited to address a chapter meeting of the Association of Adventist Forums (now Adventist Forums) held at the College, on the topic of Hebrews 9 and its implications for the Adventist investigative judgment teaching. The talk was titled, \\"The Investigative Judgment: Theological Milestone or Historical Necessity?\\" The talk criticized aspects of the traditional understanding and Ford instead suggested an \\"apotelesmatic\\" understanding, arguing that Ellen White had such an understanding.A transcript of the talk is in the public domain and was reproduced in Already a controversial figure, Ford's talk appeared to many to be an attack upon fundamental church beliefs. Ford was summoned to the General Conference headquarters in Washington, D.C. He was given six months to write up his views. Late in 1979, he stopped lecturing and moved to Takoma Park, Maryland to research and produce the 991-page manuscript, Daniel 8:14, the Day of Atonement, and the Investigative Judgment. While Ford was in basic agreement with the position of the Adventist Church and the majority of Christendom on the atonement, which declares Christ's \\"sacrifice in behalf of man was full and complete\\" and \\"On the cross the penalty for human sin was fully paid\\" and with other Adventists as seeing Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary as the application of the benefits of His already completed work on the cross, Ford directly challenged traditional Adventist views of how to interpret prophecy and how to view the fulfillment of the Day of Atonement by Christ in a way that appeared to completely undermine the denomination's historical reason for existence. Nevertheless, Ford insisted at the start of his manuscript \\"The present writer has as his intent the defense of the church.\\" =Expulsion from teaching and ministry= In August 1980, a group of Adventist theologians and administrators convened at Glacier View Ranch in Colorado to examine Ford's views. According to TIME magazine, he \\"made the case that White's 'sanctuary' explication of 1844 no longer stood up, and that 'investigative judgment' undercut the belief in salvation by God's grace apart from good works.\\" The culmination of this event was Ford losing his employment with the denomination as a minister and theology professor. After counsel from the General Conference, the Australasian Division withdrew \\"Ford's ministerial credentials.\\" Ford's mentor, Edward Heppenstall, saw him as moving in some theological areas that his mentor could not agree with. Heppenstall was disappointed when he failed to dissuade Ford from his position at Glacier View, subsequently writing to him that he \\"was shocked at how far\\" he \\"had swung to the left Biblically and doctrinally\\". To commemorate the 30th anniversary of Glacier View, the Sydney Adventist Forum held a pretend courtroom trial to assess the accuracy of Ford's claim that the Consensus Document has been largely in agreement with him. They concluded, \\"Ford was found to be substantially correct in claiming that the 114-member Sanctuary Review Committee (SRC) Consensus Document was in agreement with his twelve propositions‚Äîwhile Ministry was judged to have considerably over-stated its case.\\" It concluded, \\"In retrospect, it is clear that the SRC made‚Äîin five days‚Äîmore progress in understanding this biblical doctrine than the church has typically made in any fifty years of its history.\\"Trevor G Lloyd, \\"Sydney Adventist Forum assesses Desmond Ford and Ministry magazine against Consensus Document \\". Adventist Today online, 12 November 2010 Reaction to dismissal In 1980, following Ford's dismissal from the Adventist ministry and professorship, a group of Pacific Union College students along with others at Andrews University founded a sympathetic unofficial journal, entitled Evangelica, in 1980. A group of professors at the college also expressed their displeasure with the General Conference and its then president, Neal C. Wilson, by writing parodies of certain Adventist hymns, an event which became notorious in conservative Adventist circles as the \\"singing incident\\". Further Note: All participants in the unofficial journal \\"Evangelica\\" were fired. After being dismissed from the ministry, Desmond Ford chose to remain a member of the Seventh-day Adventist church. He founded an interdenominational Christian ministry named Good News Unlimited, which gave him a platform to continue preaching. In 2000, he retired and moved back to Australia from America; in retirement, he continued his association with both Good News Unlimited and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

The Spring of Bandusium () is a natural water source in rural Italy, to which the Roman poet Horace addressed a well-known ode (Odes 3.13). The location of the spring is unknown: speculation has centered on Apulia, the poet's birthplace, and the neighborhood of an archaeological ruin east of Rome, thought to be the site of poet's beloved Sabine farm in what is now the commune of Licenza. In the poem Horace promises to sacrifice a young goat to the spring and praises the spring's constancy in the hottest days of summer. The poem ends with Horace promising to immortalize the spring through his song. Location Evidence that the original Fons Bandusiae may have been located in Apulia, near Horace's childhood home, comes from a papal bull of Paschal II, dating to 1103. This bull mentions a \\"church of the Holy Martyrs Gervasius and Protasius at the Bandusine spring in Venusia\\" (ecclesia sanctorum martyrum Gervasii et Protasii in Bandusino fonte apud Venusiam). (Nendeln, Liechtenstein: Kraus Reprint, 1970); see also Travelers have proposed the village of Palazzo San Gervasio, 13 km east of Venusia, as the probable location of the church but failed to match any of the nearby springs with Horace's description., Recent scholarship suggests that Horace may have named a pleasant spring near his Sabine farm after a similar spring in the vicinity of his native Venusia.

Cond√© is best known for her novel S√©gou (1984‚Äì85).Cond√©, Maryse, and Richard Philcox. Tales from the Heart: True Stories from My Childhood. New York: Soho, 2001. Her novels explore the African diaspora that resulted from slavery and colonialism in the Caribbean. Her novels, written in French, have been translated into English, German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. She has won various awards, such as the Grand Prix Litt√©raire de la Femme (1986), Prix de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie francaise (1988), Prix Carbet de la Carraibe (1997)\\"Author Profile: Maryse Cond√©\\". World Literature Today (September‚ÄìDecember 2004), 78 (3/4), p. 27. and the New Academy Prize in Literature (2018) for her works.  Early life  Born as Maryse Boucolon at Pointe-√†-Pitre, Guadeloupe, she was the youngest of eight children. In an interview entitled \\"I Have Made Peace With My Island\\" Maryse Cond√© recounts aspects of her early life. Cond√© describes her parents as among the first black instructors in Guadeloupe. Cond√©'s mother, Jeanne Quidal directed her own school for girls. Cond√©'s father, Auguste Boucolon previously an educator, founded the small bank \\"Le Caisse Coop√©rative des pr√™ts\\" which was later renamed as \\"La Banque Antillaise.\\" Cond√©'s father, Auguste Boucolon had two sons from his first marriage, Serge and Albert.Cond√©'s three sisters are named Ena, Jeanne and Gillette. Her four brothers are named Auguste, Jean, Ren√©, and Guy.Cond√©'s birth 11 years after Guy, made her the youngest of the eight children. Cond√© was born while her mother was 43, and her father was 63. Cond√©'s describes herself as \\"the spoiled child\\", which she attributes to her parents older age, and the age-gap between her and her siblings. Cond√© began writing at an early age. Before she was 12 years old she had written a one-act, one-person play.The play was written as a gift for her mother Jeanne Quidal's birthday. After having graduated from high school, she attended Lyc√©e F√©nelon from 1953 to 1955.Cond√© was expelled after two years of attendance.Cond√© instead furthered her studies at the Universit√© de Paris III (Sorbonne Nouvelle) in Paris. During her attendance, she along with other West Indians, established the Luis-Carlos Prestes club. Life In 1959, Cond√© attended a rehearsal of Les N√®gres/The Blacks by Jean Gen√™t, where she would meet the Guinean actor Mamadou Cond√©. In August 1959 she married Mamadou Cond√©. They eventually had four children together. By November 1959 the couple's relationship became strained, and Cond√© moved to the Ivory Coast, where she would teach for a year. During Cond√©'s returns for the holidays she became politically conscious through a group of Marxist friends. Cond√©'s marxist friends would influence her to move to Ghana. Between the years 1960 and 1972 she taught in Guinea, Ghana (from where she was deported in the 1960s because of politics), and Senegal. In 1973 she returned to Paris, and taught Francophone literature at Paris VII (Jussieu), X (Nanterre), and Ill (Sorbonne Nouvelle). In 1975, she completed her M.A. and Ph.D. at the Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris in comparative literature, examining black stereotypes in Caribbean literature.Rebecca Wolff, Interview: \\"Maryse Cond√©\\" , Bomb Magazine, Vol. 68, Summer 1999. Retrieved April 27, 2016. In 1981, she and Cond√© divorced, having long been separated. The following year she married Richard Philcox, the English-language translator of most of her novels. She did not publish her first novel, H√©r√©makhonon until she was nearly 40 because \\"[she] didn't have confidence in [herself] and did not dare present [her] writing to the outside world.\\" However, Cond√© would not reach her current prominence as a contemporary Caribbean writer until the publication of her third novel, S√©gou (1984). Following the success of S√©gou, in 1985 Cond√© was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to teach in the US. She became a professor of French and Francophone literature at Columbia University in New York City in 1995. Cond√© has taught at various universities, including the University of California, Berkeley; UCLA, the Sorbonne, The University of Virginia, and the University of Nanterre. She retired from teaching in 2005. Literary significance Cond√©'s novels explore racial, gender and cultural issues in a variety of historical eras and locales, including the Salem witch trials in I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem (1986); the 19th-century Bambara Empire of Mali in S√©gou (1984-1985); and the 20th-century building of the Panama Canal and its influence on increasing the West Indian middle class in Tree of Life (1987). Her novels trace the relationships between African peoples and the diaspora, especially the Caribbean. Her first novel, H√©r√©makhonon, was published in 1976. It was so controversial that it was pulled from the shelves after six months because of its criticism over the success of African socialism. While the story closely parallels Cond√©'s own life during her first stay in Guinea, and is written as a first-person narrative, she stresses that it is not an autobiography.Lionnet, F. (1989). \\"Happiness Deferred: Maryse Cond√©'s Heremakhonon and the Failure of Enunciation\\". In Autobiographical Voices: Race, Gender, Self-Portraiture (pp. 167‚Äì190). Ithaca; London: Cornell University Press. The book is the story, as she described it, of an \\"'anti- moi', an ambiguous persona whose search for identity and origins is characterized by a rebellious form of sexual libertinage\\". She has kept considerable distance from most Caribbean literary movements, such as Negritude and Creolit√©, and has often focused on topics with strong feminist and political concerns. A radical activist in her work as well as in her personal life, Cond√© has admitted: \\"I could not write anything... unless it has a certain political significance. I have nothing else to offer that remains important.\\" Cond√©'s later writings have become increasingly autobiographical, such as Tales From the Heart: True Stories From My Childhood (1999) and Victoire (2006), a fictional biography of her maternal grandmother in which she explores themes of motherhood, femininity, race relations, and the family dynamic in the postcolonial Caribbean. Who Slashed Celanire's Throat (2000) shows traces of Cond√©'s paternal great-grandmother. However, her 1995 novel Windward Heights is a reworking of Emily Bront√´‚Äôs Wuthering Heights, which she had first read at the age of 14. Cond√© had long wanted to create a work around it, as an act of \\"homage.\\" Her novel is set in Guadeloupe, and race and culture are featured as issues that divide people. Reflecting on how she drew from her Caribbean background in writing this book, she said: > \\"To be part of so many worlds‚Äîpart of the African world because of the > African slaves, part of the European world because of the European > education‚Äîis a kind of double entendre. You can use that in your own way and > give sentences another meaning. I was so pleased when I was doing that work, > because it was a game, a kind of perverse but joyful game.\\" Among her plays are: * An tan revolisyon, published in 1991, first performed in Guadeloupe in 1989 * Comedie d'Amour, first performed in Guadeloupe in 1993 * Dieu nous l'a donn√©, published in 1972, first performed in Paris in 1973 * La mort d'Oluwemi d'Ajumako, published in 1973, first performed in 1974 in Gabon * Le morne de Massabielle, first version staged in 1974 in Puteaux (France), later staged in English in New York as The Hills of Massabielle (1991) * Pension les Alizes, published in 1988, first staged in Guadeloupe and subsequently staged in New York as Tropical Breeze Hotel (1995) * Les sept voyages de Ti Noel (written in collaboration with Jos√© Jernidier), first performed in Guadeloupe in 1987.Alvina Ruprecht, \\"An Interview with Maryse Cond√©\\" (abstract), International Journal of Francophone Studies, Vol. 2, Issue 1 (January 1999).

It is the fourth and final installment of the Mega Man Zero subseries of the Mega Man franchise and is set several months after the events of Mega Man Zero 3. The game deals with Dr. Weil's reign over Neo Arcadia in which humans, who have been reduced to second-rate citizens, begin to escape in large numbers to the last-known livable location on the planet, Area Zero, beginning a conflict between the two groups. The effects of this war eventually drive Zero and the Resistance to protect Area Zero and its inhabitants from Dr. Weil.(2006) Capcom Mega Man Zero 4 Instruction Booklet (in English). Since its original release, it has been brought to the Nintendo DS family of systems as part of the Mega Man Zero Collection in 2010 and the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016. In February 2020, it was released on PC (Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One as part of the Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection. Plot Several months after the destruction of Omega, Dr. Weil has assumed a dictatorial reign over Neo Arcadia, forcing many humans to flee. In response, Dr. Weil labels the escapees as Mavericks and begins to purge them as if they were Reploids. A fleeing caravan led by a human journalist, Neige, is attacked by Dr. Weil's army. Zero, Ciel and a small band of Resistance fighters happen upon them and come to their aid. Neige explains they were en route to Area Zero, the crash site of the space colony Eurasia and one of the last natural habitats on Earth that can support human life.Rouge: Data about Area Zero has been sent from the Resistance Base. Since the crash of the space colony, the section has been sealed off, but apparently the land has been renewed in that time and nature is becoming more and more abundant. Ciel: Nature is coming back to Area Zero!? Rouge: It's said to be due to an environmental system still left active after the crash. It's not much, but it still means hope for humanity. (Mega Man Zero 4) Capcom Japan, 2005 Shortly after parting ways, Zero learns of a plot called \\"Operation Ragnarok\\", meant to destroy all environments outside of Neo Arcadia in order to force humans to return and live under Dr. Weil's rule.Craft: We need the power of Ragnarok to destroy this much nature. Once Ragnarok has begun, one Reploid will be beneath our concern. There's no time to deal with him now. Zero: Destroy the nature in Area Zero!? Just what are you trying to do!? Craft: My name is Craft. I am a soldier of Neo Arcadia... No, Lord Weil. We... Lord Weil... requires all nature be destroyed. Fenri Lunaedge: Lately there are a lot of impudent humans thinking the world outside Neo Arcadia is better. Sol Titanion: That's why we must make sure it isn't by burning it. Popla Cocapetri: Then, nobody will have delusions of escaping Lord Weil! (Mega Man Zero 4) Capcom Japan, 2005 Helping Dr. Weil on his quest are a group of violent Reploids called the Eight Einherjar Warriors. They are led by a military Reploid named Craft, who has a romantic history with Neige, thus creating conflicting thoughts within him. After defeating four of the Einherjar Warriors, Area Zero comes under attack by Neo Arcadia. Zero defends it and is forced to battle Craft. Neige breaks up the fight, but she is kidnapped by Craft, who escapes. Zero chases him to a prison where Neige is held and eventually rescues her. Later, Zero eliminates the remaining Einherjar Warriors, but Ciel intercepts a radio message from Dr. Weil. He announces he is going to use Ragnarok, an orbiting satellite weapon, to wipe out Area Zero.Weil (radio): I told you Zero! You don't have a chance of stopping Ragnarok! Laying down a blanket of destruction from the comfort of my space cannon was what Ragnarok was built for the whole time! The Eight Warriors were nothing more than a diversion until I could complete Ragnarok! Zero: Operator! Can you transfer me to Ragnarok? Rouge: I'm sorry, I can't pinpoint the coordinates! I can't send you anywhere without a destination! Weil (radio): Hehehe! Bwahahaha! Your confusion thrills me to no end! You pathetic insects around getting excited about your precious nature! I want to hear you scream as you meet your doom! (Mega Man Zero 4) Capcom Japan, 2005 Before Dr. Weil can use it, Craft turns on him and fires Ragnarok at Neo Arcadia in an attempt to kill Dr. Weil, which leaves the city in ruins. Zero, deeming Craft to be too dangerous, defeats him, and Craft succumbs to his wounds.Craft: I've destroyed Ragnarok's remote control system. I am no longer your dog to yank around by the chain! Craft: Now I control Ragnarok! Your space cannon is no longer pointed at Area Zero... It's pointed at you and Neo Arcadia! Weil: Seduced by the sweet words of a woman! Unbelievable! You do realize how many humans and Reploids are living under my control! Craft: Are you saying I should play the loyal Reploid and follow you!? Not doing... Not thinking... Just waiting at your beck and call? And are you condoning the destruction of nature, struggling just to survive!? I... I will not let you take control! I've fought too long and too hard for humanity to let you! I will change the world! Ciel: What!? So you're going to attack Neo Arcadia instead!? There are still humans and Reploids there! Come in Resistance Base! Reploids are dispatched to help with the injured. (Mega Man Zero 4) Capcom Japan, 2005Ciel: Zero! Respond! Zero: Ciel... I stopped Ragnarok... Ciel: And Craft? Zero: And Craft... Ciel: I'm sorry... I don't know what to say... (Mega Man Zero 4) Capcom Japan, 2005 Ragnarok moves on a crash course for Area Zero, and Zero makes his way there to find that Dr. Weil somehow survived the destruction of Neo Arcadia. Dr. Weil reveals that while he is human, he was made into a bionic-reploid hybrid by the people who exiled Omega and himself into space at the end of the Elf Wars. His new body is incapable of aging or dying, as it constantly repairs itself.Zero: That voice... Dr. Weil! How did you survive that attack from Ragnarok!? Weil: Survive? That's easy... Because I can't die! Zero: What happened to you!? Weil: Hehehe... Did my mechanical body surprise you? Did you think that I was a Reploid and you could fight me? I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm pure human... Even with a body that looks like this! Zero: How!? Weil: When the Dark Elf took control of the Reploids and destroyed the Mavericks in the Elf Wars... The humans of the time modified me... They transferred all of my memories into program data... And switched my body for this armor with the power to rejuvenate me... Do you have any idea what that means? I can't age, and wounds heal more quickly than normal. After the war, I was cursed to live an eternity in a world without light or nature... The humans expelled me from Neo Arcadia! (Mega Man Zero 4) Capcom Japan, 2005 Believing he can survive the impact of the crash and personally oversee the destruction of Area Zero, Dr. Weil fuses himself with the Ragnarok core and attacks Zero. After an intense battle and the destruction of Dr. Weil's body, Ragnarok breaks apart, but leaves Zero no means of escape. Ciel runs through Area Zero where she learns that Zero did not teleport back.Rouge: Ragnarok... is... breaking apart... Rouge: Ragnarok has entered the atmosphere. Most of it will burn on entry... Impact with Area Zero has been averted. Mission... successful... Ciel: Zero! Come in Zero! Zero... please... Come in... Rouge: There's no response from the receiver... The connection has been lost... (Mega Man Zero 4) Capcom Japan, 2005 Heartbroken and distraught, Ciel runs off and ends up on top of a hill, where she breaks down in tears while pieces of Ragnarok burn through the atmosphere. Afterwards, she stands up and expresses her faith in Zero, hoping that he'll return someday while promising to carry on his mission of maintaining peace between humans and Reploids. The final scene shows Zero's shattered helmet somewhere in the desert.Ciel: Zero... You believed in us... Now it's our turn to show you that your faith in us was not misplaced... Watch Zero... I'll make this world a better place... One where humans and Reploids can walk hand in hand, living in peace... Just come back someday... I... I believe in you! (Mega Man Zero 4) Capcom Japan, 2005 Gameplay The fourth installment of the Mega Man Zero series introduces gameplay changes, but does not deviate from the platforming of its predecessors. Players guide Zero through eight main selectable stages, which are usually separated into two parts by a mini-boss battle. At the end of each level, the player faces one of the game's reploid antagonists. Mega Man Zero 4 includes a new Easy Mode, not found in its prequels, in response to criticisms that the Mega Man Zero series had become too challenging. In Easy Mode, Zero receives a large life boost and can use the Cyber Elf without restrictions. However, Easy Mode prevents the changing of the weather, and consequentially the acquiring of EX Skills. Zero is still equipped with the Buster Shot and Z-Saber at default. However, in place of the Shield Boomerang and the rod-type weapon from the previous games (i.e.: Triple Rod, Chain Rod and Recoil Rod) is the new Z-Knuckle. This device allows Zero to perform several actions, including hanging from pipes, destroying obstacles, stealing an enemy's weapon (if Zero destroys it using the Z-Knuckle) and acquiring special weapons in certain parts of a stage. alt=split-screen image illustrating the different weather settings Another new element is the weather system, which allows players to choose between two weather conditions for each of the eight main stages. The difficulty of the stage varies depending on the chosen weather condition, with the stage being harder if the weather icon has an orange border around it. Sometimes, there are secret passages in some stages which the player can only reach by setting the weather to \\"hard\\". The trade-off for an easier level is that Zero cannot learn an EX Skill from a boss. Cyber Elves, a core element of previous Mega Man Zero installments, are small helpers who can assist Zero in combat. Shortly after the introductory levels, a Cyber Elf will arrive for Zero to equip. This elf has most of the powers of Cyber Elves from previous games, which are unlocked as the player raises its level by feeding it E-Crystals. Zero may select one power from each of three categories: Nurse, Animal, and Hacker. The player's ranking at the end of a level is no longer given a penalty for using the Cyber Elves as long as they are kept under the maximum power limit. In addition to this, Zero can now equip body chips to enhance his abilities, including double-jumping and self-recovery, similar to early Mega Man X titles. Zero cannot rely on finding secret disks to give him enhancements as in Mega Man Zero 3. Instead, players must collect parts dropped randomly from defeated enemies. Recipes for combining these parts can be obtained from NPCs the player rescues or a Cyber Elf after its stages of evolution. However, the majority of the recipes are found through experimentation with combinations of parts. Another distinguishing feature of this installment is that Neige and Ciel have different faces depending on their emotion. For instance, after Zero \\"dies\\", Ciel is sitting near a tree and tells a promise that saddens her and brightens her. Neige also has an angry face, one that Ciel lacks. =Mini-games and modes= Mega Man Zero 4 has multiple modes. Easy Mode and Normal Mode are available from the start. Easy Mode makes the game easier to play, but prevents changing the weather conditions or acquiring EX Skills. After completing the game once on Normal Mode, players can access an additional Hard Mode or start a new game over the old one. There is also an Ultimate Mode, which can only be unlocked when certain criteria are met. Like the previous game, there are seven mini-games that can be unlocked once certain criteria are met. They are as follows: *Lumberjack ‚Äì Beat the game with an overall S-Rank. *Lava Surf ‚Äì Beat the game with a complete database. *Busy Basket ‚Äì Beat the game once on Hard Mode. *Slam Harvest ‚Äì Beat the game in less than one hour. *Plant Panic ‚Äì Beat the game without feeding your Cyber Elf any E-Crystals. *Elf Chase ‚Äì Beat the game without using any recipes. *Energy Lab ‚Äì Surpass the high score on all the other mini-games. Development Capcom Japan's announcement of a sequel to Mega Man Zero 3 was anticipated, following the pattern of development news from the previous two Mega Man Zero games. Capcom updated its official site quietly with information stating that the game would have an April 2005 release in Japan. Reception Mega Man Zero 4 has an average of 77% on Metacritic and GameRankings, making it roughly the 85th best-ranking Game Boy Advance title. Mega Man Zero 4 entered Japanese sales charts at number eight during its release week. According to Media Create sales information, Mega Man Zero 4 was the 177th best-selling video game in Japan in 2005 at approximately 74,354 copies. Mega Man Zero 4 has been called a \\"refined version of an outstanding platformer series\\" with a more streamlined weapon and Cyber Elf system. Critics were quick to state that it hadn't changed much and that it was \\"more of the same\\". One reviewer, however, stated that the level designs were \\"slightly less challenging\\" than those of previous installations, but more inventive. The simplified Cyber Elf system received mixed reviews. GameSpot thought the new single Cyber Elf was an improvement, while Jeremy Parish of 1up.com stated that it signalled a return \\"to the old-fashion Mega Man game structure\\", which he found \\"unfortunate since the Zero games' greatest strength was their willingness to break the trite and true Mega Man mold\\". Critics were mostly neutral about the weather system, saying that diehard players wouldn't make use of the system. It was seen as a nice idea, but the effects weren't \\"pronounced enough to make most levels worth playing through twice\\".

This release was the last recorded output to feature vocalist Anders Frid√©n, later of In Flames, who was fired and replaced by then rhythm guitarist, Mikael Stanne. Incidentally, Mikael Stanne was the lead vocalist on the first In Flames studio album, Lunar Strain. The album was re-released in 1999 by Century Media Records as Skydancer/Of Chaos and Eternal Night. It was also remastered and reissued later in 2013 in celebration of the album's twentieth anniversary. Style Sundin described Skydancer as \\"unique\\" within the band's catalogue due to its \\"weirdness and eccentricity\\", which caused him to look back on the album as \\"more of an acquired taste rather than a breakthrough release.\\" When asked how far the band has come since the release of this album, Niklas Sundin stated: Sundin recalled \\"a real sense of excitement throughout the songwriting process, and it felt like we really were onto something new and original that we needed to capture on tape and let people listen to as soon as possible.\\" Recording, production, and remastering Sundin, while noting that the band were well prepared, recalled that \\"studio recordings back then were always stressful. Our budget only allowed for ten studio days for recording and mixing, so there wasn't any time to fine-tune things, and we often had to use first takes even if they weren't perfect. There was a good idea of we wanted to accomplish, but we lacked the studio knowledge to communicate it to the engineers, who in turn were clueless about extreme metal, so there were lots of tension and misunderstandings.\\" Niklas Sundin observed that the album was not properly remastered at the time of the 2000 edition, and indicated that the twentieth anniversary edition would mark the first proper mastering of the album. Describing the production as \\"the weak point\\" of Skydancer, and qualifying that \\"there are limits to what one can do without access to the separate instrument tracks,\\" he expressed his opinion that \\"everything sounds much better now. The album is so old that there wasn't even any proper mastering done the first time around; all songs had a different output volume and are sonically very incoherent.\\" Critical reception Skydancer has received generally positive reviews, although the album's marked departure from later material has been met with some critical barbs. For instance, writing for Allmusic, Jared Anderson criticized the \\"generally fractured and unfocused\\" arrangements and \\"shifting tempos, rhythms, and time signatures\\" for \\"limit[ing] the album's appeal\\". Conversely, Sputnik Music praised the album for its \\"awesome song writing and flawless execution\\", which the critic suggested is the first melodic death metal album.\\" Reflecting upon Skydancer, a \\"retro review\\" by About.com described it as a \\"dark horse\\" in the band's catalogue, \\"even more so than the controversial Projector. Describing the album as \\"primitive\\" and featuring an \\"underwhelming\\" performance by Anders Frid√©n, the reviewer nonetheless praised the \\"sense of adventurism\\".

Career Born in Detroit, Michigan, Cohen began his career in show business as a gofer and later an usher at the Dexter Theater in Detroit, starting he was just 12. By 18, he was managing the Dexter. From there he went on to become assistant manager of the Fox Theatre (also in Detroit) ‚Äî a theater featuring 5200 seats. After a tour of duty with the Marines, Cohen became sales manager for Columbia Pictures in the Detroit Area and moved to Hollywood to work for the publicity department of Columbia in the 1940s. In the 1950s he started producing films, first working as assistant (and later associate) producer for Jack Broder and Realart Pictures on such films as Bride of the Gorilla, Battles of Chief Pontiac (featuring Lon Chaney, Jr.), Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla and Kid Monk Baroni (featuring a 21-year-old Leonard Nimoy as a street kid turned boxer). He later worked for Allied Artists and United Artists producing such films as Target Earth, Magnificent Roughnecks (with Mickey Rooney), and Crime of Passion (with Barbara Stanwyck and Raymond Burr). Cohen also wrote the stories and/or screenplays for at least nine films, co-writing with pal Aben Kandel and sometimes using one pseudonym between them ‚Äì either \\"Ralph Thornton\\" or \\"Kenneth Langtry\\" (Kandel also wrote solo for Cohen on Kid Monk Baroni and, using the Thornton moniker, on Blood of Dracula). Cohen had greater success in the mid-50s though, with a horror film for American International ‚Äî I Was a Teenage Werewolf, which he both wrote and produced. The film cost about $100,000 to make, but earned more than $2 million. He also discovered young Michael Landon, cast in the lead role for I Was a Teenage Werewolf. Cohen followed this success by writing and producing more teen horror films, such as I Was a Teenage Frankenstein, How to Make a Monster, and Blood of Dracula. In a 1991 interview with Tom Weaver, Cohen reflected, \\"I have always felt that most teenagers think that adults ‚Äì their parents, or their teacher, anyone who was older and who had authority ‚Äì were culprits in their lives.\\" Cohen also occasionally appeared in his own films, usually as an uncredited extra. He played the director in the projection room in How to Make a Monster, and can also be seen in I Was a Teenage Werewolf, Konga, Black Zoo, Crooks and Coronets, and Trog. In the 1960s and 1970s, he began producing horror films in the United Kingdom, working with such stars as Joan Crawford in Berserk! and Trog, and Jack Palance in Craze. In 1961, he returned to his roots in Detroit, purchasing the Fox Theater he had worked for in his youth. By the late 1970s, Cohen was working more in writing and distribution than in film production. He founded Cobra Media, a domestic distribution company, in 1981. Cohen died of throat cancer on June 2, 2002.

The band found success at home and abroad after teaming up with Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn. They have had a number of line-up changes and were still actively touring in 2018. Their most popular hit single, \\"Living Next Door to Alice\\", peaked at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart and, in March 1977, reached No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other hit singles include \\"If You Think You Know How to Love Me\\", \\"Oh Carol\\", \\"Lay Back in the Arms of Someone\\", and \\"I'll Meet You at Midnight\\". History =Early years= The band was formed as \\"The Yen\\" after a chance meeting between Ron Kelly and Alan Silson in Moore's Music Shop, North Parade, Bradford, in October 1963. Two days after that meeting they were joined by Chris Norman for rehearsals, but without finding a suitable bass player, just practiced together for a year. The addition of Terry Uttley on bass guitar at the beginning of 1965 completed the line-up and The Yen's first gig was at Birkenshaw School in February 1965. It was composed of Chris Norman (lead vocals/rhythm guitar), Terry Uttley (bass/vocals), Alan Silson (lead guitar/vocals), and Ron Kelly (drums). They were renamed \\"The Sphynx\\", and later \\"Essence\\". As Essence, they toured small clubs in Bradford and the surrounding communities before they split in 1966. The Black Cats were already a working band when Ron Kelly joined them at Dewsbury College in September 1966. The Black Cats at this time were Peter Eastwood on guitar/vocals and Arthur Higgins on bass. Kelly replaced the drummer they had at the time. Alan Silson and Pete Eastwood joined the band, but the latter soon left and was replaced by Chris Norman. In November 1967 the band changed their name to \\"The Four Corners\\". In April 1968, the group found a manager in Mark Jordan, who advised them to rename themselves \\"The Elizabethans\\". The group now became fully professional, and the members garnered higher salaries. In June 1968, Terry Uttley joined the group as a replacement for Arthur Higgins, who had left the band in order to carry on his education. On 9 December 1968 the group had their first TV appearance on Yorkshire Television's news and magazine show Calendar. In August 1969, the four performed two songs for the BBC show High Jinx. Enthused with this successful performance, Jordan had them record their first demo tape. In January 1970, RCA Records showed an interest in the band and suggested a name change to \\"Kindness\\". The double A-side \\"Light of Love\\"/\\"Lindy Lou\\" was released on 3 April 1970. An arrangement was made with Ronnie Storm (no connection to Rory Storm) to back him on the single release \\"My Desire\\", and it was released under the pseudonym \\"Fuzzy and The Barnets\\" due to contractual difficulties encountered by Storm. At the same time Steve Rowland, of Family Dogg, heard the band playing live on Radio One Club and offered to sign them to his production company. He arranged for Albert Hammond, who was also in Family Dogg, to write a number for the band, entitled \\"It Never Rains in Southern California\\". However, before it could be released, Hammond decided to record it himself, for which Kelly was recruited by Steve Rowland to play drums. Hammond wrote other songs for the band, and a single \\"You Ring a Bell\\"/\\"Have You Met Angela\\" was recorded, but due to various problems in Rowland's organisation, it was not released. In late 1971 the band's management was taken over by Dave Eager, the BBC Radio One DJ, at the same time that Norman suffered a serious infection that affected his vocal cords. After his recovery, his voice sounded much rougher, which the other group members considered an interesting addition to their sound. Eager introduced them to Decca, which resulted in recordings in February 1972, their first single being \\"Oh Julie\\"/\\"I Love You Carolina\\". Shortly thereafter, their next single was released. \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\" was liked by the media and was selected as the opening theme for Emperor Rosko's BBC Radio One Saturday show, but this popularity did not translate into record sales. The last Decca single was \\"Make it Better\\"/\\"Lonely Long Lady\\", which flopped, and their Decca contract was cancelled. =Rise to fame= During the band's Decca contract, Eager used his contacts with the Manchester-based agency Kennedy Street Enterprises, to gain the band an audition to be Peter Noone's backing band. The band were asked to become his permanent band after their audition at Noone's House in Denham, Buckinghamshire, and soon they embarked on a nationwide tour with him. Noone did not bring the boys any luck, but during the tour Bill Hurley offered to manage them. Hurley convinced Eager to release the boys from the contract with him. Ron Kelly left Kindness on 8 August 1973 and the band recruited an old school friend, Pete Spencer (drums/vocals), who had played in various groups, to drum for them. This line-up performed on a sightseeing boat in Frankfurt, Germany. Hurley introduced the band to composers Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who also wrote songs for glam rock contemporaries Sweet, Mud, and Suzi Quatro. At first \\"Chinnichap\\" turned them down, but Hurley's tenacity eventually convinced the composers/producers to give the young group a chance. Hurley and Chinnichap started working with the band, and suggested yet another name change, to \\"Smokey\\". An attempt to dress the band up in leather clothes (similar to Suzi Quatro) was dropped, and the four won acceptance for their jeans outfit. They purchased new instruments and in late 1974 began recording their debut album Pass It Around which was released 14 February 1975. The album spawned the title track as a single but failed to gain significant attention. In April Smokey opened for Pilot on tour. =Height of popularity= On 22 September 1975, Smokey released their second album, Changing All the Time. The first single from the new album, \\"If You Think You Know How to Love Me\\", became a hit in many European countries, peaking at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. They followed it with \\"Don't Play Your Rock 'n' Roll to Me\\". Around this time, Smokey Robinson threatened to file a lawsuit, alleging that the band's name would confuse the audience. In order to avoid legal action, the group changed the spelling to \\"Smokie\\". They began their first tour as headline act, after the release of their second album. The third LP was partly produced in the US, where Nicky Chinn had relocated. Called Midnight Caf√©, it built on the popularity of Changing All the Time. The subsequent years yielded a string of successful singles: \\"Something's Been Making Me Blue\\", \\"Wild Wild Angels\\", and \\"I'll Meet You At Midnight\\". Their cover of Australian band New World's single, \\"Living Next Door to Alice\\", released in November 1976, reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, followed by another hit \\"Lay Back in the Arms of Someone\\". Smokie now found themselves European superstars, with sold-out tours and million-selling albums. The next two albums, 1977's Bright Lights & Back Alleys and The Montreux Album (1978), cemented their status and were both chart successes. From Bright Lights & Back Alleys came two hit singles, the reggae influenced \\"It's Your Life\\" and a cover of \\"Needles and Pins\\". At the peak of Smokie's success in 1978, Chris Norman teamed up with Suzi Quatro and released a duet single, \\"Stumblin' In\\" ‚Äî another Chinnichap composition. Norman and Quatro were on top of the European charts for some time, and it reached the US Top 10, though only No. 41 in the UK. Smokie's subsequent 45 was \\"Mexican Girl\\". Composed by Norman and Spencer, the record saw the group actively distance itself from Chinnichap. Chris Norman and Pete Spencer wrote and produced the British football star Kevin Keegan's first single, \\"Head Over Heels in Love\\", a No. 31 UK hit. In 1979, the album The Other Side of the Road was released, entirely recorded in Australia. It spawned two more singles for the band, \\"Do to Me\\" and \\"Babe It's Up to You\\", but it became clear that their sales were declining. Smokie took a hiatus before Solid Ground was released in 1981. The advance single was a cover of Del Shannon's 1963 hit, \\"Little Town Flirt\\" ‚Äî but it failed to reach the UK Singles Chart. Chris Norman and Pete Spencer wrote the song \\"This Time (We'll Get It Right)\\" which, recorded by 1982's England's World Cup Squad became a number 2 hit in the UK Singles Chart. =Decline and Norman's departure= In early 1982, the last album for EMI/BMG was released, Strangers in Paradise. The departure from Chinnichap became notable, and the four members of Smokie appeared unable to recreate their success using their own material. Shortly after the release of Strangers In Paradise, work began on two parallel albums, one released by Smokie as Midnight Delight, and the other Chris Norman's solo debut, Rock Away Your Teardrops. Neither release sold well. In 1983, band members Alan Silson, Chris Norman and Terry Uttley collaborated with Agnetha F√§ltskog, singing together on the track \\"Once Burned Twice Shy\\" from her first English language solo album entitled Wrap Your Arms Around Me. The band say it was on the flight to record this song in Sweden that they decided to part ways. Chris Norman began his solo career and Terry Uttley went on to play bass for several other groups including Peter Goalby and John Coughlan (ex Status Quo drummer). The band said \\"It just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.\\" Though Smokie had begun work on a comeback, in 1986, Norman, by that stage enthused with the relative success of his second solo album, Some Hearts Are Diamonds, announced that he was to leave the band. He was replaced by Alan Barton, formerly of Black Lace, a friend of the band's, who had a vocal style similar to Norman's. Smokie also recruited keyboard player Martin Bullard. Spencer quit and was replaced on drums by Steve Pinnell. The new line-up released All Fired Up in 1988, which brought some attention and contained a new version of \\"Rock Away Your Tear Drops\\", the song that had been the title track to Norman's debut album. =Comeback= Several releases followed over the next years including Boulevard of Broken Dreams (1989, seven weeks at No. 1 in Norway; all tracks were produced by Simon Humphrey, except \\"Young Love\\", which was produced by Dieter Bohlen); Whose Are These Boots? (1990, No. 1 in Norway); Chasing Shadows (1992); and Celebration (1994), which contained old hits in new arrangements accompanied by an orchestra. None had any real success in the UK. However, Smokie made a surprise return to the UK Singles Chart in 1995, with a duet with the controversial northern comedian Roy Chubby Brown. The re-worked re-release of \\"Living Next Door To Alice (Who the F**k is Alice)\\" reached No. 3 in the UK. The band had noticed that, whilst touring in Ireland, whenever they sang the main line \\"For 24 years/I've been living next door to Alice\\" the audience would shout \\"Alice? Who the fuck is Alice?\\" In addition, a resident DJ in a Dutch caf√©, Gompie, organised a recording, and had a No. 17 UK hit with the title of \\"Alice (Who the X is Alice) (Living Next Door to Alice)\\" in the United Kingdom, and in the Netherlands where it reached No. 1. Shortly after the song was recorded Smokie's tour bus careered off of the road during a hailstorm in Germany. Barton, badly injured, died after five days in intensive care. The rest of the band and Brown agreed to donate their royalties from the song to Barton's first wife. =1990s‚Äìpresent= The remaining members decided to continue with the band and went about finding their third lead singer. Friend of the band Mike Craft was chosen. The band released The World and Elsewhere later that year, followed by Light a Candle ‚Äî The Christmas Album. In 1996, Alan Silson terminated his membership, saying he intended to pursue a solo career and to work with other acts as well, joining Mickey Finn's T. Rex, and that he also no longer wanted to be on the road all the time. Mick McConnell, one of the band's road crew and their guitar technician replaced him as the group's new lead guitarist, this formation recording the next album, Wild Horses ‚Äì The Nashville Album (1998), in Nashville, Tennessee. In February 2001, Smokie released two albums, Uncovered and Uncovered Too, which consist entirely of cover versions, with no original songs. In 2004, Smokie recorded a studio album, On the Wire, with eleven of the 14 songs written by the band themselves. In 2006, the band released the album From the Heart. Although mainly a compilation, it did contain three new tracks. In 2010, Smokie gained new chart success with a CD of brand new material, Take a Minute. Released in Denmark in August of that year, it peaked at number three on the Danish Albums Chart. Releases in the remainder of Scandinavia and Germany took place during October, with the single \\"Sally's Song (The Legacy Goes On)\\" ‚Äî a continuation of the story of the other character in \\"Living Next Door to Alice\\" ‚Äî also released.

History MƒÅorimusic, and MƒÅori cultural in general, went through a renaissance in the early 1980s, both in terms of revival of traditional styles and political self identity. Many MƒÅori came to identify with the politics and rhythms of the reggae music of the Caribbean, leading to the development of a distinctly New Zealand reggae style, led by groups such as Herbs and Dread Beat & Blood. In 1982, MƒÅori singer Dalvanius Prime recorded a song, Poi E, with kapa haka group Patea Maori Club combining breakdancing rhythms with traditional MƒÅori music, which became a surprise hit - the biggest hit in Te Reo MƒÅori for 25 years.Bourke, Chris \\"MƒÅori and Pacific music, 1980s and 1990s,\\" Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand. 22 October 2014.

It takes its name from the feast day of Saint Elisabeth of Hungary which was formerly November 19. It ranks 20th in the list of worst floods in history. During the night of November 18 to November 19, 1421, a heavy storm near the North Sea coast caused the dikes to break in a number of places and the lower lying polder land was flooded. A number of villages were swallowed by the flood and were lost, causing between 2,000 and 10,000 casualties. The dike breaks and floods caused widespread devastation in Zeeland and Holland. The outcome This flood separated the cities of Geertruidenberg and Dordrecht which had previously fought against each other during the Hook and Cod (civil) wars. Most of the land remains flooded even since that day. Reclaimed parts Most of the area remained flooded for several decades. Reclaimed parts are the island of Dordrecht, the Hoeksche Waard island, and north-western North Brabant (around Geertruidenberg). Most of the Biesbosch (a big area of nature in the Netherlands) area has been flooded since. Cause of the flood The cause of the flood was a heavy northern storm, a tidal surge, northerly winds and low pressure. Water from the storm in the North Sea surged up the rivers causing the dikes to overflow and break through. The flood reached a large sea arm between south-Holland and Zeeland or Zealand, destroying the Grote Hollandse Waard. At the lower point where the flood water reached the city of Dordrecht is the point where flood water still remains today.

Population: History The history of Nizhny Tagil begins with the opening of the Vysokogorsky iron ore quarry in 1696. The deposits were particularly rich, and included lodes of pure magnetic iron. The surrounding landscape provided everything needed for a successful and productive mining and smelting operation ‚Äî rivers for transport, forests for fuel, and suitable climate. Over the following decades, the city developed as one of the early centers of Russian industrialization, and it has been a major producer of cast iron and steel. The town of Nizhny Tagil is also known for its production of the famous soviet tank T-34-85. The T-34-85 made here has manufacturing changes like a triangle shape flat armour surface on the turret, and wheels with a type of spoke. First Russian locomotive T-72 monument in its production place, Nizhny Tagil The first Russian steam locomotive was constructed there in 1833, and the father-and-son engineers who developed it, Yefim and Miron Cherepanovs (–ß–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∞–Ω–æ–≤), were in 1956 commemorated by an bronze statue (executed by sculptor A. S. Kondratyev and architect A. V. Sotnikov) which stands in the center of the Theatrical Square in the heart of downtown. According to some sources, the copper for the skin of the Statue of Liberty was mined and refined in Nizhny Tagil. However, research by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, USA, suggests that the Visnes mine in Norway is the most likely source. In the 1990s, police estimated that about 50% of adult males were in the Russian Mafia. Membership has declined since then. In early 2007, a mass grave with 30 murdered girls and women was found near Nizhny Tagil. They had been abducted in the city by a prostitution gang between 2002 and 2006. See Nizhny Tagil mass murder (2002-2007). A fictionalized description of Nizhny Tagil and these murders appears in ‚ÄúThe Bourne Sanction,‚Äù by Eric Van Lustbader, chapters 28, 30, 34 and 39. Geography Rivers and ponds take up one third of the city's territory. Nizhny Tagil spans from north to south and from east to west. The altitude of the city varies from . The city is built around the extinct volcano Lisya Mountain. This mountain with a watchtower on its top is a symbol of the city. Another hill, , is located in the northern part of the city at an altitude of . Neighboring cities include Yekaterinburg to the south, Serov and Priobye in the north, Perm in the west, and Alapayevsk and Verkhnyaya Salda in the east.

Precipitation is mostly concentrated between late spring and early fall, peaking in the months of July and August. A freeze has been recorded for every month of the year. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of the administrative divisions, Nizhny Tagil serves as the administrative center of Prigorodny District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with twenty-three rural localities, incorporated separately as the City of Nizhny Tagil‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #30-OZ As a municipal division, the City of Nizhny Tagil is incorporated as Nizhny Tagil Urban Okrug.Law #85-OZ The city is divided into three city districts: Leninsky, encompassing the city center and Nizhnetagilsky Pond; Tagilstroyevsky, a comparatively small section at the north part of town; and Dzerzhinsky, a sizable section to the east of the city center principally consisting of apartment buildings and other residences. Government Former mayors: #Nikolay Didenko 2006-? #Valentina Isayeva 2008-? #Sergey Nosov 2012-? Economy In 2015, a large portion of the land within the bounds of the city is dominated by the facilities of the factories located in this industrial city. Nizhny Tagil is an industrial center of the Middle Urals. Highly power-intensive industries such as ferrous metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, and metal working are well-developed in the city. A total of 606 manufacturing companies operate in Nizhny Tagil. Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Plant (Nizhnetagilsky Metallurgichesky Kombinat, NTMK) is a leading Russian steel company. Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) is the main producer of modern tanks on the territory of the former Soviet Union and Russia. It is the largest main battle tank manufacturer in the world. The T-72, T-90, and T-14 are produced in the city. As of 2016 an economic slowdown in Russia had resulted in diminished demand for civilian products such as train cars, but strong demand continued for tanks. There are resources to manufacture medical tools for traumatology at the Nizhny Tagil medical tools plant. =Expo- Center= Nizhny Tagil is one of centers of exhibition activity in the Middle Urals.

Life  Verrill was born on February 9, 1839 in Greenwood, Maine, the son of George Washington Verrill and Lucy (Hillborn) Verrill. As a boy he showed an early interest in natural history, building collections of rocks and minerals, plants, shells, insects and other animals. When he moved with his family to Norway, Maine at age fourteen he attended secondary school at the Norway Liberal Institute.Coe 1932 p. 20 Verrill started college in 1859 at Harvard University and studied under Louis Agassiz. He graduated in 1862 with a B.A. He went on scientific collecting trips with Alpheus Hyatt and Nathaniel Shaler in the summer of 1860 to Trenton Point, Maine and Mount Desert Island and in the summer of 1861 to Anticosti Island and Labrador.Verrill 1958 p. 55 In 1864 Verrill made reports on mining, or prospective mining, properties in New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania.Verrill 1958 p. 57 Two years after graduation from Harvard, he accepted a position as Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School first Professor of Zoology, and taught there from 1864 until his retirement in 1907. In 1861 while under the guidance of Louis Agassiz at Harvard he was sent to Washington D.C. to obtain specimens from the Smithsonian institution and promote friendly relations and interest between the scientific men of Washington and those of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.Verrill 1958 p. 43 Under the direction of Spencer Fullerton Baird, Verrill spent almost three months working on the coral collections of the Smithsonian. The process of overhauling the collection required identifying various species, selecting type specimens and making up a set of duplicates to be sent back north to Harvard. While in Washington he became acquainted with many scientists and formed lifelong friendships with a number of them.Verrill 1958 p. 45 The friendship that Verrill and Baird developed, led to the appointment of Verrill as assistant to the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries in 1871.Verrill 1958 p. 65 In this role, which he held till 1887, Verrill was responsible for marine investigations and all invertebrate collections.Verrill 1958 p. 68}} The estimated several hundred thousand specimens collected between 1871 and 1887 were sent to New Haven for Verrill to sort, identify, catalogue and label. As partial compensation for his work, after the first set of type specimens was sent to the Smithsonian, he was allowed to keep the first set of duplicates as personal property. Upon retirement he sold this personal collection to the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, where they now form part of the Invertebrate Zoology collection. Between 1868-70 he was professor of comparative anatomy and entomology in the University of Wisconsin. From 1860 Verrill investigated the invertebrate fauna of the Atlantic coast, with special reference to the corals, annelids, echinoderms, and mollusks, and became the chief authority on the living cephalopods, especially the giant squid of the North Atlantic. His Report upon the Invertebrate Animals of Vineyard Sound (1874), with Sidney Irving Smith, whose sister he married, is a standard manual of the marine zoology of southern New England. In later life he explored with his students the geology and marine animals of the Bermuda Islands. Besides many memoirs and articles on the subjects mentioned above, he published The Bermuda Islands (1903; second edition, 1907). The author published a reprint with some changes in 1903 and a 2nd edition in 1907. Verrill published more than 350 papers and monographs, and described more than 1,000 species of animals in virtually every major taxonomy group. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1959, Yale's Peabody Museum established the Addison Emery Verrill Medal, awarded for achievement in the natural sciences.  Family  Verrill married Flora Louisa Smith in 1865. They had six children. Their son, Hyatt Verrill, became an author, illustrator and explorer.

Carddass is a registered trademark of Bandai. Bandai had sold over 11.5billion Carddass cards, including 2billion Dragon Ball cards by 1998, and 500million Konjiki no Gash Bell cards by 2005. History The first Carddass, released in 1988, is based on the Saint Seiya anime series. In the past, Carddass was for trading and collection only. But since trading card games like Pok√©mon and Yu-Gi-Oh became popular in Japan, more and more Carddass is made in the form of trading cards that can be played in a game. Apart from Saint Seiya, many popular anime, manga and tokusatsu series has been made into Carddass, the most famous ones being Bleach, Toriko, Hunter x Hunter, Digimon, Dr. Slump, Dragon Ball, Kinnikuman, Gin Tama, Black Butler, Code Geass, Soul Eater, Fullmetal Alchemist, Gundam, Kamen Rider, Naruto, Neon Genesis Evangelion, One Piece, Revolutionary Girl Utena, YuYu Hakusho, Ranma ¬Ω, Sailor Moon, InuYasha, Slam Dunk, Konjiki no Gash Bell!!, Rurouni Kenshin, Ultraman, and Yu-Gi-Oh! (the Carddass game is based on Toei's anime and is not to be confused with Konami's card game). In 2006, a Super Sentai-based trading card game, Rangers Strike, was released in commemoration of the Super Sentai Series' 30th Anniversary. In 2007, Carddass started to sell Top Trumps in Japan. A digital version of the game, Data Carddass, was introduced in 2005. This series revolves around arcade machines that can read specially designed cards to access in-game content, such as weapons, characters or clothes. Also recently introduced are AR Carddass, which utilises augmented reality features in smartphones, and Net Carddass which utilises online functionality.

The name stands for Detroit News, where the first iceboat of this type was designed and built in the winter of 1936‚Äì1937. Archie Arrol was a master craftsman working in the Detroit News hobby shop, and together with iceboaters Joe Lodge and Norman Jarrait designed a racing boat they called the \\"Blue Streak 60\\", later to become known as the \\"DN 60\\". In 1937 a group of 50 laymen worked with Archie in the hobby shop to produce the first fleet of the new iceboats. These first boats broke during the initial season, and after Jarrait and Lodge modified the design to increase the strength, the group got back together to build a second set of iceboats in 1938.Zacharias, Pat (1998-02-08): \\"Sailing on Lake St. Clair's icy winter winds\\" , The Detroit News ‚Äì detnews.com, retrieved on 2009-01-12 This design, featuring a narrow, single-person cockpit, three steel blades in tricycle style arrangement and a steeply raked mast, remains to this day the most popular iceboat design in use. The DN is 12 feet (3.7 m) long, with a 21 inch (53 cm) wide cockpit and an 8-foot (2.4 m) wide runner plank. The 16 foot (4.9 m) mast supports 60 square feet (5.6 m¬≤) of sail area. The front runner is typically rigged with a steering rod that connects the runner to a tiller that is mounted just aft of the mast base.\\"IDNIYRA Official Specifications\\" , idniyra.org, retrieved on 2009-01-12 The boat weighs around 100 lb (45 kg), and is piloted by a single helmeted sailor. The class has a devout following. The International DN Ice Yacht Racing Association (IDNIYRA) is the governing body for the class. It publishes standards for boat design and allows enthusiasts to assemble for races and to share good ice locations. The DN is raced extensively in the northern United States, Canada, and throughout Northern Europe, with World Championships alternating between North American and Europe each year.\\"IDNIYRA Official Results\\" , idniyra.org, retrieved on 2009-01-12 In addition to the World Championship, the North American and European Championships count towards a racer's World Ranking.\\"IDNIYRA Official Ranking Lists\\" , idniyra.org, retrieved on 2009-01-12 One of the reasons that the DN iceboat class has become so popular over the years has been largely in part to how transportable and fast they truly are.

It is the second game of the Mega Man Battle Network series. It was released in 2001 in Japan and 2002 in America and Europe. The story of the game starts after the events of Mega Man Network Transmission. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on November 12, 2014 and in North America on January 8, 2015. Gameplay The general gameplay is essentially identical to that of the original Mega Man Battle Network game; indeed, the two games utilize a significant amount of the same graphics. However, Battle Network 2 introduces several new concepts that augment the original game-system. In terms of health, Mega Man no longer heals fully and automatically after each battle. Furthermore, the game introduces the SubChip, a device similar in basic concept to a battle chip but one that can only be activated outside of battle. Where in the original, a player had only one chip folder, Battle Network 2 introduces the possibility of alternate active folders, allowing players to easily customize their range of possible attacks to conform to multiple situations. Notably, chips used in one active folder are not available for the construction of a second, even though only one folder may be used at any given time. Up to three folders can be found in this game, and all are fully customizable. As in the previous game, folders may have up to five Navi chips each and only five of the same kind of any chip (the first game allowed up to ten of the same non-Navi chip). Aside from the addition of new Battle Chips in general, Battle Network 2 expanded the old chip code system, which had previously been limited only to the alphabet. Some Chips could occur with an asterisk (*) as their code letter, a wild card symbol meaning the Chip can be used with any other Chip. This game is the only Battle Network game (besides 6) where it is possible (from one chip trader only) to get * coded Navi chips. There are now 250 chips possible in single player mode, with chips 251-260 possible only via NetBattling, and chip #261 (Sanctuary) earned when the player completes Hard Mode. Players can also now earn up to five stars on the title screen by completing major tasks in the game. Additionally, players may access NetSquares in the game. These places serve as a sort of Town Square for NetNavis and their operators to relax, buy supplies, and exchange information. One final change was the replacement of the old armor system, which only affected damage received, with a style system that affects damage received, attack damage, physical appearance, among other benefits. During the course of the game MegaMan may take on one of five Styles (Guts, Team, Custom, Shield, and Hub), each of which will also be aligned with one of four elements (Heat, Wood, Elec, and Aqua). He can store up to two styles in his memory at once and change out when not battling. Starting with Battle Network 2, anytime a chip trader is used, the game will automatically save when the player receives their new chip. This is to prevent the player from cheating by simply soft resetting without saving until the chip trader gives out a desirable chip, which was possible in the first game. Another chip trader tradition that starts with this game and continues on for the remainder of the series is that there is one ten chip trader that will appear only upon completing Story Mode (yellow star), and gives out the best chips of all the chip traders. Story Three months following the events of Mega Man Battle Network (two following Network Transmission; both game facts), the story opens with the world in a time of peace following the defeat of the organization known as the WWW. However, NetCrime, as perpetrated by a NetMafia organization known as Gospel, is on the rise. Once again Lan Hikari (known as Netto Hikari in the Japanese version) and his NetNavi MegaMan become involved and work to defeat Gospel's plot to destroy society. NetNavis Operators are given the chance to become City NetBattlers, a lesser form of an Official NetBattler, which Lan does, allowing him to travel around the world, both in cyberspace and in real life. In doing so, Lan befuddles Gospel's attempts to collect four particularly powerful computer programs, called simply SuperPrograms, on numerous occasions. However, Gospel is finally successful and uses these programs, in combination with computer bugs, to construct a SuperNavi of immense power. This Navi is a duplication of Bass, who appeared in the original game as a hidden boss and who plays a larger role in later games. However, after fighting Megaman the Bass copy destabilized and transformed into a gigantic, wolf-shaped super Multi-bug Organism (Also referred as Gospel) that heavily resembles the sixth game's Gregar. The energy needed to create this Navi causes unusual radiation, blending the Net and the real world together. This radiation eventually paralyzes Lan, effectively making him incapable of operating MegaMan, however the latter puts the two into full synchronization so that Lan may control MegaMan by thought and emotion, similar in concept to the final confrontation of the original game. During the final battle it is revealed that the leader of Gospel is Sean Obihiro, a child who felt neglected by and resentful of society after his parents died in a plane crash. After defeating the Multi-bug Organism Gospel, Lan promises to be the boy's friend after he has paid for his crimes. After the credits, Bass is seen destroying copies of himself, and shows anger toward the human that made them (implying to Sean). He swears he'll exact his revenge on the humans and then disappears.  Reception  Mega Man Battle Network 2 sold 124,349 units in Japan during 2001 and has been listed by Dengeki Online as the 91st best- selling video game in the region for that year. Famitsu sales data showed that the game was the 30th best-selling game of 2002 with a total of 344,230 units sold by the end of year. The magazine showed a total of 446,938 units sold in the country at that point.

The association is known for rejection of the legitimacy of successorship of 67th High Priest Nikken Abe. Nikken Abe expelled the association in 1980, citing further defiance while demoting those who have returned to Nichiren Shoshu to a loss of priestly capacities and loss of senior roles as probationary punishment. Most of these priests have either aged and deceased, reverting back their temple property with new younger Nichiren Shoshu priests taking over the administration to the Head Temple Taisekiji while others have accordingly joined other Nichiren sects until their retirement. Background During the 1970s, the S≈çka Gakkai undertook a number of activities and propagated several notions that many in the Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ priesthood and laity saw as deviations from traditional Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ doctrine. Ultimately, the sentiment within the priesthood and traditional lay organizations grew so strong that a split became imminent, and, at a special leaders meeting held at Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ Head Temple Taiseki- ji on 7 November 1978, termed the Tozan of Apology, the senior leadership of S≈çka Gakkai apologized to the priesthood and promised to correct the incompatibilities and never deviate from Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ doctrine again. This apology was later printed in both the Seikyo Shimbun SGI magazine (November edition) as well as the manuscript of the Dai-Nichiren December 1978 publication. On 24 April 1979, S≈çka Gakkai's President Daisaku Ikeda stepped down to take responsibility for the incident. In addition, at the 40th General Meeting of the S≈çka Gakkai on 3 May 1979, the 66th High Priest Nittatsu Hosoi declared his decision to accept the organization's apology and forgive the matter on the explicit condition that S≈çka Gakkai observe its solemn promise to uphold Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ doctrine. Nittatsu also instructed his own priests to stop open criticism of S≈çka Gakkai and to cease encouraging S≈çka Gakkai members to affiliate themselves directly with the temples, which had previously exacerbated the contested issue. Succession dispute On 22 July 1979, Nittatsu died of chronic heart disease without directly naming his successor. Shinno Abe, at that time a young priest, insisted that he was secretly given permission to be the next High Priest by Nittatsu before he had died and succeeded him as the 67th High Priest, Nikken Abe. He changed his predecessor's policy and gave S≈çka Gakkai a chance to cooperate with him. But the priests (who were mainly the disciples of the former High Priest) who later formed the Sh≈çshinkai disagreed, claiming S≈çka Gakkai had only taken its deviations underground.Montgomery, Daniel (1991). Fire In The Lotus. Mandala, an imprint of Grafton Books. p. 200-201. The same group of dissenting priests continued their campaign of criticism and formed Sh≈çshinkai to organize their efforts into a movement. Despite repeated admonitions from the new High Priest Nikken and Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ leadership to cease and desist, Sh≈çshinkai went ahead with a major rally on 24 August 1980. Due to this dissension, Nikken and the senior Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ leadership punished a number of priests for their involvement, including five excommunications. The Sh≈çshinkai priests involved with the excommunication responded that such act was ineffective because the punishment was done by an illegitimate High Priest. On 13 December 1980, the priests of the Sh≈çshinkai sent a document to Nikken casting doubt on the legitimacy of his office. They then filed suit with a local government court on 21 January 1981 seeking to annul Nikken's appointment on the grounds that he had never been named successor by Nittatsu. Nikken demanded that the Sh≈çshinkai priests retract their accusations or face excommunication. Some two hundred priests refused. Upon the publicized notice of excommunication, a number of them filed a lawsuit seeking reinstatement, but the local court ruled that all religious claims, including the petition for annulment of Nikken's status were internal Nichiren Shoshu matters to be resolved within the sect itself. Later years The Sh≈çshinkai continued its anti-S≈çka Gakkai and anti-High Priest Nikken activities, even accepting new acolytes into the priesthood and conferring initiation ceremonies for new believers. Most Sh≈çshinkai priests continued living within their Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ temples, which they were technically allowed to do until their death. The Head Temple Taisekiji has declared that these temple properties have since reverted to Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ as their occupants have died or been ordered by the courts to vacate. While many have deceased or abandoned their priesthood, only a few Sh≈çshinkai priests have reverted to Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´, and even so they were deprived of their kesa and Koromo Robe and had to start as complete beginners (kozo) as part of their punishment. Accordingly, their temples remained under Nichiren Shoshu as the priests have aged and new younger priests affiliated with the Head Temple Taisekiji take on the role of the temple property administration. Accordingly, several Sh≈çshinkai priests from the 1980s have also gone to other varying Nichiren sects as they age, among them in particular is the Nichiren Sh≈´ sect at Kuon-ji in Yamanashi Prefecture. There, they haven also opened a research center called Kofu Danjo (ËààÈ¢®Ë´áÊâÄ) that has spawned books that have attracted attention from other Nichiren Buddhist organizations for their scholarly content.

It is the third game in the Mega Man Battle Network series, released in 2002 in Japan and 2003 in North America. While in North America and Europe, two complementary versions of the game - Blue and White - exist, marketed simultaneously, this was not the case in Japan. The game was first released in a single version in this region, although later a version containing bug fixes, new areas, optional bosses, and other improvements was released some months after the original. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on December 17, 2014 and in North America on May 14, 2015. Story The year is 200X. Doctor Wily has reformed the evil organization WWW and now seeks to release Alpha, an evil prototype version of the Internet that was locked away before the current Internet was set up. To release him, Wily needs the passwords, referred to in- game as TetraCodes, to the firewalls Alpha is trapped behind, which are hidden in secret locations. A tournament called the N1 Grand Prix is being held, supposedly to determine who is the best NetBattler. It is later revealed to be part of the plan for Wily to steal the TetraCodes, and the WWW attacks between rounds. Lan Hikari and his NetNavi, Mega Man, have to fight NetNavis sent by Wily and attempt to defend the TetraCodes from Wily, but he manages to retrieve them anyway with the help of Bass, and uses them to release Alpha. Lan and Megaman confront Wily immediately after he releases Alpha, and battles Bass. After Bass is deleted, Alpha consumes Dr. Wily and proceeds to infect the whole of the Internet with his coding. Megaman battles Alpha, and is able to defeat him. As Alpha begins to delete, the network in the area begins to crash as Alpha attempts to absorb everything to save itself. Unfortunately, this includes Megaman and Lan. In an attempt to allow Lan to escape, Megaman overloads, sacrificing his life to save Lan. Later, Lan's father manages to recover Megaman during a salvage operation of the affected network location, and is able to revive him. Gameplay The gameplay in Battle Network 3 is similar to that of its predecessors, with few graphical enhancements and minor gameplay changes. Battle Network 3 saw the removal of Power-Ups that were collected to improve the MegaBuster - instead the Navi Customizer was added, allowing abilities to be added on with certain rules as to how these abilities can be added with respect to each other. Each version of the game has a separate Contest Navi: BowlMan for Blue/Black, and MistMan for White. Blue also includes another Navi, Punk, that could be challenged from time to time. Punk's chip was only available as part of a special promotion in Japan. However, it can be attained via a cheat device or by being traded from Black to Blue. White, on the other hand, has no such Navi. In Battle Network 3 the virus breeder is available, where special, friendly viruses (that must be found first somewhere in the net) are kept and can be fed using BugFrags. When a virus is found and put in the breeder, a chip for that virus is obtained. Feeding each virus BugFrags levels up their chip accordingly. After a family of a certain type of virus has been fed to the max, they will release information to the player as to where the Omega Virus of that family (i.e. For the KillerEye family, they will give you a clue to find KillerEye Omega) can be found. After the Omega Virus of that family is found and deleted, it will join the others in the Virus Breeder and will be available when the corresponding Virus Chip is used. This is the only Battle Network game that features non-Navi Omega viruses. Battle Network 3 introduces further classification of Battle Chips by splitting them into three categories: 200 white Standard chips, 85 blue Mega chips and 25 pink Giga chips. Standard Chips are limited to only four of each kind (even if letter codes are different) per folder. Mega Chips are limited to only five per folder, and only one of each kind. Only one Giga Chip is allowed per folder and only one copy of each Giga chip exists throughout the entire game. These specifications would continue for the remainder of the series. There are certain types of programs (see Navi Customizer) that can boost the Mega and Giga chip limits, though. There are five unique Giga chips exclusive to each version and this would continue for the remainder of the series, although Battle Network 5 offers six Giga chips per version. There are also Program advances which are a combination of three or four chips. =Multiplayer= Multiplayer is accessible from the Comm option on the Main Menu. Multiplayer, also called \\"Netbattling\\", allows two players to fight head to head with their respective Megaman.EXEs (this includes style-changes and health, as well as Navi customizer stats). When you enter the Multiplayer screen, the player can choose from Netbattling, Trading Chips, and Comparing Libraries. By choosing the Netbattling option from the Comm menu, a player is given two options again, Practice and Real. Practice allows two players to battle with no risk of losing chips, and does not count against your Win/Loss record. In Real, matches count for win-loss records and the losing player in a Netbattle forfeits a chip randomly chosen from their chip pack. There is a special Giga- Chip that is attained in this fashion (DeltaRayEdge Z for Blue, Balance Y for White), which has a 1/32 chance of happening instead of the winning player acquiring the other player's chip. For these chips to be attained, both players MUST have at least one star and you must be battling in midweight or heavyweight, real. After choosing Practice/Real, players can choose Lightweight, Midweight, and Heavyweight. Lightweight allows players to battle on a level field, with no negative panels on either side. Midweight may give certain obstacles on either player's side of the field, such as Rockcubes and plain Rocks. Panels may also be cracked or broken. Heavyweight is guaranteed to have negative panels on both sides, and some matches contain rapidly replenishing Guardians, which deal 200 damage (400 on ice or to aqua style, 800 to an aqua style on ice) to a player who hits them. Players can also trade Battle Chips with other players. No Giga Chip can be traded. Trading is required to attain all seven stars in the game, due to the lack of Mistman in blue version and Bowlman in white version. The \\"Comparing Libraries\\" option scans both players' libraries. If one player has a Battle Chip that the other player does not, the other player shall attain a blank spot in the library that represents that chip. From here, the player can buy that Chip from Higsby's shop in ACDC Town after the defeat of Beastman; using the Order System. Giga Chips cannot be bought from Higsby's Shop.

Structures passing through Superior orbital fissure. A number of important anatomical structures pass through the fissure, and these can be damaged in orbital trauma, particularly blowout fractures through the floor of the orbit into the maxillary sinus. These structures are: * superior and inferior divisions of oculomotor nerve (III) * trochlear nerve (IV) * lacrimal, frontal and nasociliary branches of ophthalmic (V1). * abducens nerve (VI) * superior and inferior divisions of ophthalmic vein. Inferior division also passes through the inferior orbital fissure. * sympathetic fibers from cavernous plexus These include nonvisual sensory messages, such as pain, or motor nerves. They also serve as vascular connections. The nerves passing through the fissure can be remembered with the mnemonic, \\"Live Frankly To See Absolutely No Insult\\" - for Lacrimal and Frontal divisions of the ophthalmic nerve (V1), Trochlear nerve (IV), Superior division of the oculomotor nerve (III), Abducens nerve (VI), Nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve (V1) and Inferior Division of the oculomotor nerve (III).

It is the fourth game in the Mega Man Battle Network series. Like Battle Network 3 before it, Battle Network 4 has two different versions, Red Sun and Blue Moon, that differ in story and gameplay details. Battle Network 4 is compatible with the e-Reader, and can be linked up with Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation and the Battle Chip Gate for NetBattles. It is able to link with Mega Man Zero 3, and contains references to Konami's Boktai series. Plot The beginning of the game shows the player at a space research center known in-game as NAXA. Scientists have discovered a massive asteroid speeding toward the earth that, if made contact with, would end all life on earth. The game then cuts to the protagonists, Lan Hikari and MegaMan.EXE (in this continuity a Network Navigator or NetNavi, an in-universe AI program), going shopping with their father. While in the electronics district, they find themselves pitted against a NetNavi known as ShadeMan, portrayed as having strong dark powers. Upon defeating ShadeMan, he disappears, dropping unknown data. It is revealed to Lan and MegaMan to be a DarkChip, a program described as unleashing great power at the cost of the Navi's soul (their goodness and well-being). The duo are warned to never use it under any circumstances. The game cuts back to the scientists, who are now joined by some of the best scientists and researchers of various countries, including the duo's father. They come to the conclusion that the best way to avoid impact with the asteroid is to use a laser to move it off-course. The game again changes to the perspective of the protagonists. The next in-game day, after the ShadeMan incident, Lan and MegaMan participate in the Den Battle Tournament, the local NetBattle tournament, and become the champions. After completing the tourney, they return home to find it burglarized by someone connected to the DarkChip. Upon investigation, they discover that the DarkChip Syndicate Nebula was behind the attack of their home, looking for the DarkChip the two possess. After defeating a Nebula member in battle, he warns the duo that the syndicate has their eye on them and the DarkChip. With no leads to go on, the pair decide to go to the amusement park, only to find the animatronics going haywire. Lan and MegaMan find ShadeMan in one of the animatronic animals. In order to best ShadeMan, MegaMan has no other option but to use the DarkChip. Now, without the DarkChip or ShadeMan, the duo decide to enter the Eagle/Hawk Tournament held by the amusement park. The team emerge victorious once again. After the tournament, they meet LaserMan, the leader Navi of Nebula, who shows MegaMan the DarkSoul lurking within him now that he has used a DarkChip. Meanwhile, the scientists fire the laser at the asteroid, but it fails. One of the scientists, Dr. Regal, claims to have an idea and asks for a world-class Net Operator and Navi. Naturally, Lan and MegaMan are invited to the Red Sun/Blue Moon Tournament, a competition explained as putting together the best of the best of NetBattlers. After winning the tourney, the duo are taken to NAXA and are briefed on the situation. It is explained that the asteroid has a computer in it and can be steered away from the planet. Before Lan has the chance to send MegaMan to the asteroid, Dr. Regal reveals himself as the leader of Nebula and had been planning all along to use the asteroid in his plan for world domination. Still, Lan is able to send MegaMan, where he once again meets LaserMan, as well as Duo, the Operating System of the asteroid. MegaMan defeats both of them and convinces Duo that the planet is worthy enough to not be destroyed. The asteroid leaves, and Regal appeared to have committed suicide in order to avoid legal prosecution, but was revealed to be alive in the sequel. Once again, Lan and MegaMan have saved the world from the latest crisis. Gameplay Battle Network 4 greatly differs from Battle Network 3 in many ways, the most notable of which is the concept of DoubleSoul (Soul Unison in the original). DoubleSoul is similar to how the classic-style Mega Man could acquire the weapons of the Robot Masters that he has defeated: by using DoubleSoul, Mega Man.EXE could use the powers of other NetNavis in the same manner as how classic Mega Man could use the powers of the Robot Masters through their weapons. To perform a DoubleSoul, which lasts for a temporary amount of time (three turns), however, a chip must be sacrificed for the battle. Another key feature is that it takes a minimum of three playthroughs of the game's main story mode in order to uncover all of its secrets - although many criticize the game for the same reason. After each playthrough, a player is permitted to either continue with their existing game or to start a new game at a higher level of difficulty, although any save at a higher level of difficulty will overwrite a save of the lower level. Thus, it is very important for those players who want to collect all chips and power-ups to be sure that all blue/purple mystery datas and all V1 virus' chips and program advances have been collected before starting Level 2. The same is true for going on to Level 3. Finally, DarkChips, which are powerful chips resulting in a host of negative side-effects, make their debut in this game: a mood indicator in the corner of the screen shows the mood of MegaMan, and should the mood change to a negative one, random DarkChips will appear in Mega Man's Custom Screen. Each DarkChip will have many negative (and notable permanent) side-effects, that taint MegaMan's own soul with darkness. Should the darkness overwhelm MegaMan, he will find a different selection of chips are made available to use, with a different selection of Program Advances (like the infamous \\"DarkNeo\\" Program Advance, which involves the Bass GigaChip) therein. Also, when you use a DarkChip (aside from the battle with Shade Man in the ToyRobo and in free tournaments at Higsby's shop), Mega Man permanently loses 1 HP for each and cannot regain all HP lost, even if you were to purify yourself. There are also special chips (like the 5 evil chips) that can only be used if Mega Man is completely consumed by dark power. Conversely, if Mega Man does enough battles (about 1000) without ever using a Dark Chip, he will turn brighter in color and allow him to more easily achieve Full Synchro mode. =Emotion Window= The Emotion Window is a mood indicator that lets the operator know Mega Man's current state based on fighting performance. The window also changes whenever DoubleSoul is used, to a mugshot of the corresponding Soul used. Full Synchro is a heightened state of focus gained by performing a counter-attack against a virus (I.e. attacking the virus just before it attacks). In this state, Battlechip attacks are doubled in strength. It is possible to consecutively achieve Full Synchro by continuously counter-attacking and thus doubling effectiveness in battle. Full Synchro expires when the player fails to counter-attack a virus, or when MegaMan suffers damage. Conversely, when a fight is not playing in Mega Man's favor, unless in a doublesoul, he gains an anxious expression and following this, Darkchips begin to display themselves in the Custom Screen. Also during this emotional state, DoubleSoul transformations are disabled. The player can return to a normal, calm state by successfully counter-attacking a virus, restoring HP, scoring hits on the enemy, or winning the battle. If, during battle, Mega Man suffers repeated hits at a rapid rate, or if he is stunned for a period of time, he goes into a state of rage which is similar to Full Synchro in the way that it doubles Battlechip attack power, but instead of a focused expression in the emotion window, Mega Man has an angry expression and in the battle screen he glows orange. As such, it can be considered a desperation state which gives the player a chance to turn the battle towards their favor. Rage will expire when the player attacks and damages a virus, or if the player successfully counter- attacks, at which point the player will instead go into Full Synchro. It also expires after a while if no chip is used. Unlike Full Synchro, if Mega Man is hit while in rage, he will not revert to his normal emotion. During \\"Full Synchro\\" and \\"Rage\\" Mega Man's attacks double, giving him an extra advantage. The Emotion Window is a feature that has lived on in the Battle Network 5 and 6 games. The basic functions of the Emotion Window stated above (Full Synchro, Anxiety, and Rage) have not changed since, though the anxiety emotion has been removed in Battle Network 6, replaced with Tired and Very Tired status. =Battle Chips= \\"Battle Network 4\\" brings out many new chips, with standard chips weighing in with 150 unique attacks. Mega Chips fell in number from the previous game, only having 60 different chips. Instead of V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5 chips (previously found in Battle Network 1 and 2 with V4 and V5 chips found only in 3) are now (Navi), (Navi)SP, (Navi)DS. Five version-exclusive Giga Chips appear in each version. There are 56 new kinds of chips, called, Secret Chips. Most of these are obtained by winning Higsby's \\"Free Tournaments\\", though there are a few exceptions. For example, the player may obtain the \\"Z-Saber\\" chip by linking their game with a copy of Mega Man Zero 3. There are eight DarkChips in this game with bad effects to your Navi's soul and emotions. (See above section for information on DarkChips.) =Title Screen Badges= In the previous two games, players earned different colored stars on the title screen for completing certain tasks. Battle Network 4 replaces these with badges (sometimes called icons or marks instead) on the top of the title screen, and continues these for the remainder of the series. Battle Network 4 includes seven icons, one for defeating the final boss Duo, one for getting all Soul Unisons, one for collecting all Standard-level battlechips, one for all Mega-level chips, one for all Giga-level chips, one for completing all Program Advances, and the last for defeating Bass (Forte in Japanese) in his Omega form. =Operation Battle Mode= Linking any edition of Mega Man Battle Network 4 with the Battle Chip Gate expansion for Game Boy Advance (Sold in Japan only) would allow you to play as a Navi, depending on what Navi chip you owned. Instead of selecting chips like in normal gameplay, the custom gauge at the top would fill up and change to four different colors as it filled up, white, yellow, and blue, and red. when the bar is yellow, you can use a regular chip. When it is blue, you can use a mega chip, and at red you can use a giga chip. shooting fills the gauge up faster. Development This game is known to become unplayable on original Nintendo DS systems. If the player leaves, and then returns to, the map while in Park Area during WoodMan's scenario, the game will hang indefinitely. This incompatibility was officially acknowledged by Nintendo. It does not occur on any other Nintendo DS family system or on any Game Boy Advance family systems. Capcom of Japan gathered together their surplus of Rock Man EXE 4: Tournament Red Sun and Rock Man EXE 4: Tournament Blue Moon games and put them in a special edition box that was released in Japan only on December 31, 2004 along with a special E-Card for the E-Reader. Reception The two versions of Mega Man Battle Network 4 entered Japanese sales charts as the second and fourth best-selling games of their release week and continued to appear on the top 10 best-sellers list for the following six weeks. The game sold 535,836 copies combined by the end of 2003 and an additional 393,014 copies by the end of 2004. Mega Man Battle Network 4 has sold 1.35 million copies worldwide as of December 31, 2008, becoming the best-selling game in the Battle Network series.

It is a spin-off title in the Mega Man Battle Network series. The game saw a simultaneous August 8, 2003 release in Japan on the WonderSwan Color and Swan Crystal titled . The GBA version was localized in North America and Europe the following March. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console on July 30, 2014 in Japan, with both the North American and PAL region release occurring in August 2014. Taking place within the timeline of the Battle Network series, Battle Chip Challenge involves a battling tournament called the \\"Battle Chip GP\\" among various pairs of online avatars called \\"NetNavis\\" and their human operators. Rather than directly control the player character through the traditional real-time tactical role-playing battles of the other Battle Network games, Battle Chip Challenge tasks the player with creating a \\"Program Deck\\" made up of abilities called \\"Battle Chips\\". The game randomly selects chips for the player and executes them in a duel with a computer-controlled opponent. Battle Chip Challenge suffered a relatively negative critical reception. Plot The plot of Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge involves the opening of a new netbattling tournament known as the \\"Battle Chip GP\\". Yai is sponsoring the event while the others enter it. Even Chaud enters the tournament, but only for official business. It turns out that there is some type of new organization behind the scenes of the tournament who will delete the winning Navi and take its data for themselves. Gameplay The Program Deck grid determines which chips are used each turn. Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge utilizes a different battle system from other Battle Network titles. In those games, the player may battle one or more enemies in real-time by utilizing special abilities called \\"Battle Chips\\" with the objective being to delete each enemy's hit points (HP). In this game, the player duels a single opponent simply by setting up 12 Battle Chips on a grid called a \\"Program Deck\\". The Program Deck has three columns of chips, with the first column having two chips, the second having three chips, and the last having four chips. The game selects three chips at random on one of the grid's rows, and the player's Navi uses them consecutively, ending the turn with that character's signature attack. Battle Chips have a variety of effects such as attacking, healing, and elemental status changes. \\"Navi Chips\\" will even summon other characters into the battle for a short time. After setting the deck, the player has little control over the match. Battles progress almost completely autonomously for upwards of ten rounds while the player watches for results. At certain points during the fight, the player may \\"Slot In\\" two chips to change the outcome of the battle. One possible outcome of a turn is the destruction of an opponent's Battle Chips. Certain types of attacks not only do damage to an opponent's HP, but to their Program Deck as well, as each chip also has a set amount of HP. The player can win fights not only by utilizing power, but by deleting an opponents entire deck, making them unable to fight. If ten turns pass and neither competitor has lost all of their HP, the game determines the winner based on how many chips are left in their decks. The game also has an \\"Open Battle\\" feature in the game that allows the player to select a certain area with a set amount of consecutive battles to fight. Winning every fifth battle in one of these earns the player a new Navi Chip to use as well as a variable amount of \\"Zenny\\", the game's currency. Zenny can be used to purchase more chips from the character Higsby in the game's multiple shops. The game contains six different playable pairs of operators and their NetNavis including Lan and MegaMan, Dex and GutsMan, Mayl and Roll, and Chaud and ProtoMan. There are also two new duos: Kai and Turboman, and Mary and Ring. A multiplayer feature allows up to two players connect their GBAs for battles. Development Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge was co-developed by Capcom Production Studio 2 and Inti Creates, the latter of which also developed Capcom's Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX series. The game was first announced by Capcom on April 19, 2003. It was subsequently shown at the World Hobby Fair in Japan on June 21, 2003. An English localization of the game was announced by Capcom on October 21, 2003. Reception Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge was not well received by most reviewers, currently holding an average score of 51% on GameRankings and a 54 out of 100 on Metacritic. Most reviewers such as IGN and GameSpy (among others) criticized the game for a lack of both player participation, and overall presentation. IGN even went as far as calling the it \\"quite possibly the worst game to bear the Mega Man name\\". Both reviews only praised the game's audio.

After collaborating on Cerrone's debut album Love In C Minor (1976), Costandinos assembled Love & Kisses in early 1977, and shortly after the group released their first album, Love and Kisses, which contained just two songs - and so was also classed as a double A-side single. These were \\"Accidental Lover\\" and \\"I Found Love (Now That I Found You)\\", which combined orchestral sounds, classical influences and a disco arrangement. The single charted at #1 for three weeks on Billboard's disco/dance chart. The album cover has been criticized for depicting a woman with several men's hands ripping holes in her T-shirt, with one commentator writing, \\"Although rape is not overtly shown on this record cover, the picture conveys the impression of a gang rape about to happen.\\" In a Billboard article about album covers depicting sex and violence against women, Casablanca Records' director of creative services admitted that he had \\"questions about the company's 'Love & Kisses' LP.\\" The following year saw the release of the group's second album entitled How Much, How Much I Love You (the title track covered side one, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" completed side two, along with a love song, \\"Maybe\\"), utilizing the same basic formula. Both songs became top five disco hits. This was followed closely by the group's biggest hit, \\"Thank God It's Friday\\", the theme song from the film of the same name. It peaked at #23 R&B;, #22 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #1 for six weeks on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The soundtrack, which featured Donna Summer's \\"Last Dance\\" and the Commodores \\"Too Hot ta Trot\\", was nominated for several Grammy Awards. Their third and final album, You Must Be Love was released in 1979, but met with less success. Shortly thereafter the group disassembled and later released Bap Bap.

It was directed by Paul Krasny and is most noted for the appearance of Monty Python's Graham Chapman in a rare straight role as a Detective Inspector. The film originally aired on CBS on April 5, 1987. After the cancellation of the original series, it enjoyed a second life in syndicated reruns and the film was greenlit by CBS in an attempt to gauge potential audience interest in reviving the series. While the film pulled fairly solid numbers, it was ultimately decided that the ratings were not high enough to move forward with a new series, and plans to do so were scrapped. However, the film was later split into two parts and added to the Crazy Like a Fox syndication package.

History The area was originally settled by Acadians who were expelled in 1755 during the Acadian Expulsion. After the Acadians, Canning - first called Apple Tree Landing and later Habitant Corner - was settled in 1760 by New England Planters and by the Dutch following World War II. The present name was adopted in honour of British prime minister George Canning. Canning is known around the nearby communites of Scots Bay,Baxters Harbour,Halls Harbour as a small shopping desitnation. With a Home Hardware,Pharmasave,Post Office and a Grocery store as well as many restaurants. People usually come to Canning to shop because it is closer but doesnt have the big box stores like New Minas nearby. Canning is also very important to the local community because it holds the only Gas Station passed the Ultramar in North Kentville. Locals use this gas station called Degraffs because it also has a Robins Donuts and a little pizza shop. There is also a couple restaurants in Canning as well as a Bank run by the local Valley Credit Union. Canning has a fire department which is located beside the NKEC football field. They have a sub fire station in Scots Bay but the main one is in the Village of Canning. Though much diminished in importance in recent years, Canning was once a major shipbuilding centre and shipping and rail hub for farmers in Kings County. Canning merchants and farmers founded the Cornwallis Valley Railway which ran from 1889 to 1961, connecting the village to the Dominion Atlantic Railway mainline in Kentville, Nova Scotia.\\"Canning\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Initiative The village suffered three major fires, in 1866, 1868 and 1912. Harold Lothrop Borden Monument in Canning, NS The Canadian parliamentarian Sir Frederick William Borden had a home in Canning. A cousin of Sir Robert Borden, Sir Frederick was Minister of Militia prior to the First World War. Canning has a prominent statue to the most famous Canadian casualty of the Second Boer War, Harold Lothrop Borden, a son of Sir Frederick. He died in the Battle of Witpoort. Canning was also the home of country singer Wilf Carter. He was made an honorary citizen of Canning, Nova Scotia in 1978. Carter was born in Port Hilford, Nova Scotia, but spend a great deal of his childhood working in and visiting the village and its surrounding farmland. The village is home to Glooscap Elementary School, with a student population of over 200, and Northeast Kings Education Centre (NKEC), a middle school/high school with a student population of around 920 students and 80 staff. NKEC is the first AP Capstone designated school in Nova Scotia and the first in the world to offer the virtual AP Capstone Program. The Canning Lighthouse was built in 1904 to serve the port at Borden's Wharf. It was restored in the 1990s, after more than 50 years of disuse and abandonment, and was used by the village as a tourist information centre. It was moved in 2003 to a new waterfront site on the Habitant River behind the village's small museum, where its top section was rebuilt by NKEC students.

It was launched from Johnston Atoll on and was the largest nuclear test conducted in outer space and one of five conducted by the US in space. A Thor rocket carrying a W49 thermonuclear warhead (designed by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory) and a Mk. 2 reentry vehicle was launched from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, about west- southwest of Hawaii. The explosion took place at an altitude of , above a point southwest of Johnston Atoll. It had a yield of . The explosion was about 10¬∞ above the horizon as seen from Hawaii, at 11 PM Hawaii time. Operation Fishbowl The Starfish test was one of five high-altitude tests grouped together as Operation Fishbowl within the larger Operation Dominic, a series of tests in 1962 begun in response to the Soviet announcement on August 30, 1961, that they would end a three-year moratorium on testing. In 1958 the United States had completed six high-altitude nuclear tests, but the high- altitude tests of that year produced many unexpected results and raised many new questions. According to the U.S. Government Project Officer's Interim Report on the Starfish Prime project: > Previous high-altitude nuclear tests: YUCCA, TEAK, and ORANGE, plus the > three ARGUS shots were poorly instrumented and hastily executed. Despite > thorough studies of the meager data, present models of these bursts are > sketchy and tentative. These models are too uncertain to permit > extrapolation to other altitudes and yields with any confidence. Thus there > is a strong need, not only for better instrumentation, but for further tests > covering a range of altitudes and yields. The Starfish test was originally planned as the second in the Fishbowl series, but the first launch (Bluegill) was lost by the radar tracking equipment and had to be destroyed in flight. The initial Starfish launch attempt on June 20 was aborted in flight due to failure of the Thor launch vehicle. The Thor missile flew a normal trajectory for 59 seconds; then the rocket engine stopped, and the missile began to break apart. The range safety officer ordered the destruction of the missile and warhead. The missile was between in altitude when it was destroyed. Parts of the missile and some radioactive contamination fell upon Johnston Atoll and nearby Sand Island and the surrounding ocean.

Starfish Prime caused an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that was far larger than expected, so much larger that it drove much of the instrumentation off scale, causing great difficulty in getting accurate measurements. The Starfish Prime electromagnetic pulse also made those effects known to the public by causing electrical damage in Hawaii, about away from the detonation point, knocking out about 300 streetlights, setting off numerous burglar alarms, and damaging a telephone company microwave link. The EMP damage to the microwave link shut down telephone calls from Kauai to the other Hawaiian islands.

A large number of United States military ships and aircraft were operating in support of Starfish Prime in the Johnston Atoll area and across the nearby North Pacific region. A few military ships and aircraft were also positioned in the region of the South Pacific Ocean near the Samoan Islands. This location was at the southern end of the magnetic field line of the Earth's magnetic field from the position of the nuclear detonation, an area known as the \\"southern conjugate region\\" for the test.

After the Starfish Prime detonation, bright auroras were observed in the detonation area, as well as in the southern conjugate region on the other side of the equator from the detonation. According to one of the first technical reports: These auroral effects were partially anticipated by Nicholas Christofilos, a scientist who had earlier worked on the Operation Argus high-altitude nuclear shots. According to U.S. atomic veteran Cecil R. Coale,Schwoch, James. Global TV: New Media and the Cold War, 1946-69 (Illinois, 2009). Web. Accessed March 19, 2012. some hotels in Hawaii offered \\"rainbow bomb\\" parties on their roofs for Starfish Prime, contradicting some reports that the artificial aurora was unexpected. \\"A 'Quick Look' at the Technical Results of Starfish Prime\\" (August 1962) states: A 2006 report described the particle and field measurements of the Starfish diamagnetic cavity and the injected beta flux into the artificial radiation belt. These measurements describe the explosion from 0.1 milliseconds to 16 minutes after the detonation. Aftereffects While some of the energetic beta particles followed the Earth's magnetic field and illuminated the sky, other high-energy electrons became trapped and formed radiation belts around the Earth. There was much uncertainty and debate about the composition, magnitude and potential adverse effects from this trapped radiation after the detonation. The weaponeers became quite worried when three satellites in low Earth orbit were disabled. These included TRAAC and Transit 4B. The half-life of the energetic electrons was only a few days. At the time it was not known that solar and cosmic particle fluxes varied by a factor of 10, and energies could exceed . In the months that followed these man-made radiation belts eventually caused six or more satellites to fail, as radiation damaged their solar arrays or electronics, including the first commercial relay communication satellite, Telstar, as well as the United Kingdom's first satellite, Ariel 1.  * Detectors on Telstar, TRAAC, Injun, and Ariel 1 were used to measure distribution of the radiation produced by the tests. In 1963, it was reported that Starfish Prime had created a belt of MeV electrons. In 1968, it was reported that some Starfish electrons had remained for 5 years.In The Radiation Belt and Magnetosphere. Resulting scientific discoveries The Starfish bomb contained Cd-109 tracer, which helped work out the seasonal mixing rate of polar and tropical air masses.Review of early data on mixing rate of polar and tropical air masses The Starfish EMP waveform measured by Richard L.

As a journalist and author, he was a well-known political activist in his time. He also wrote poems and songs. Nerman was a vegetarian and a strict teetotaler. Alcoholism was a major social problem in Sweden in the early 20th century, and Nerman considered alcohol to be a drug that made the working class passive instead of fighting for better conditions. Ture Nerman had younger twin brothers, the artist Einar Nerman and the archeologist Birger Nerman. Background Nerman grew up in a middle-class family in the working-class, industrial city of Norrk√∂ping. His father owned a bookstore in the city and had married an employee who was many years younger: she became the mother of Ture and his two younger brothers. As a boy, Ture Nerman loved reading the books at his fathers store, especially western books about cowboys and Indians. Nerman graduated from Norrk√∂ping gymnasium (secondary school) in 1903 at the age of 17. On his graduation day he took his school bible and tossed it in the Motala str√∂m river. In his autobiography, Nerman describes this as his first revolutionary action. Some years later when he was asked by the Swedish Social Democratic Party's leader Hjalmar Branting what had made him a socialist, Nerman answered that it had been the questioning of religion. After graduation he moved to Uppsala to study at Uppsala University. Political awakening The year 1905 saw both a revolution in Russia and revolutionary development in Scandinavia as Norway declared itself independent from the rule of the Swedish crown. These changes radicalized Ture Nerman politically to the left. He had already started reading August Strindberg, Leo Tolstoy and Ellen Key. Soon he would discover Karl Marx (even if it took many years until he fully started to study and understand Marxism). Nerman started going to socialist youth meetings in Uppsala. In 1907, Nerman was conscripted for military service. By his own request, he got medical training. Nerman had already developed an anti-militarist standpoint and in 1908 he was caught by the secret police handing out illegal anti-militarist leaflets. He was first convicted to jail, but the penalty was altered to a 300 kronor fine. His father sent him the money, but the rebellious son used it to finance a trip to Paris, where he stayed a couple of weeks. Upon returning to Sweden he was once again sent money by his father to pay off the fine to avoid going to jail. In 1909, Nerman moved to the northern city of Sundsvall where he started working as a writer for a Social Democratic newspaper called Nya Samh√§llet, (New Society). At this point Nerman had already gotten a couple of his poetry books published. Many of these were radical, provocative poems, aimed against the church, the Swedish king and the bourgeoisie. Ture Nerman joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party and soon became part of the left wing together with Zeth H√∂glund. He became one of the leaders of the left opposition of the party against its reformist leader Hjalmar Branting. On New Year's Day in 1912, and the following weeks, Nerman and some of his Swedish friends went to Germany to follow Karl Liebknecht during his election campaign. Nerman had met Liebknecht briefly a couple of years earlier on a socialist gathering in Stockholm, but this time they got to know each other well. In his autobiography, Nerman writes that he was surprised and impressed to learn that Liebknecht could speak almost fluent Swedish and liked to sing songs by Bellman. World War I and Zimmerwald In November 1912, Nerman attended the special emergency convention of the Socialist International, which had been summoned to Basel in Switzerland, due to the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. At the convention, the leaders of all the European Socialist parties agreed to stand together internationally to prevent any future wars. With a united international working class, they stated, there could be no more wars. Therefore, the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and the collapse of the Socialist International, came as a shock to Ture Nerman. Almost all the leaders of the European Socialist Parties suddenly sided with their bourgeoisie governments in support of the war, and turned against their former Socialist allies. Workers were killing workers on the battlefields. But there were exceptions. His friend Karl Liebknecht stood alone in the Berlin Reichstag, and against 110 of his own Party members, when he voted against German war credits. Learning of Liebknecht's action, Ture Nerman knew which side he was on. Together with his friend Zeth H√∂glund, Ture Nerman represented the Swedish- Norwegian members of the Zimmerwald Conference. It united the remaining international socialist anti-war movement, whose more prominent leaders were Vladimir Lenin, Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky from Russia, Robert Grimm from Switzerland, and Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht from Germany. Those two could not participate, but sent their greetings and support. Luxemburg was in jail for anti-war propaganda, while Liebknecht had been mobilized by the German military to dig trenches on the frontline. Returning to Sweden, Zeth H√∂glund was also sentenced to jail for his activities in the international anti-war movement, even though Sweden didn't participate in the World War. In America At the start of the year 1915, (before Zimmerwald), Nerman travelled around in the United States for several months. To finance the trip he wrote articles for several Swedish newspapers. He arrived by boat in New York City where he stayed only for a short time but took the chance to go up to the top of the Woolworth Building, the highest skyscraper in the world at the time. He took the express train across the continent to San Francisco where he visited the World's Fair on opening day. Ture Nerman then started a tour speaking to American workers, mostly of Scandinavian origin, in Minneapolis and Chicago. He also took some time to visit some relatives in Astoria, Oregon. When Ture Nerman returned in the mid summer to Sweden, Zeth H√∂glund complained, asking if it really had been necessary of him to go to America when he was so much needed at home in the intensifying class battle and the struggle within the Swedish Social Democratic Party between the left wing and the right wing. The birth of Swedish Communism Lenin, Ture Nerman and Carl Lindhagen in Stockholm April 1917. At the beginning of 1917, the struggle between the left and the right within the Social Democratic Party resulted in a split. Zeth H√∂glund and Ture Nerman, now considering themselves Communists, were expelled from the Party together with other prominent radicals such as Kata Dalstr√∂m, Fredrik Str√∂m and Stockholm's mayor Carl Lindhagen. H√∂glund, who was the leader of the Party's youth organisation, managed to get the whole young socialists on his side in the foundation of the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party. The new party was formed in May 1917 and had around 20,000 members. It would soon change name and become the first Communist Party of Sweden. They launched a newspaper, Politiken, in which they wrote and published texts by other international communist leaders. In April 1917, when Lenin passed through Stockholm on his journey from exile in Switzerland home to Petrograd, Ture Nerman was one of those who greeted Lenin and took care of him while there. For instance, the Swedish Communists took Lenin to the PUB department store, where they bought him a brand-new suit so he would look good and clean coming back home to Russia. Upon Lenin's return in Russia and the October Revolution that followed, Ture Nerman and the Left Social Democrats fully supported the Bolsheviks and agitated for a similar Communist revolution in Sweden. As an international representative of the Swedish Communist Party, Nerman had several communist contacts from all over the world: His friend Karl Liebknecht; Karl Radek, the Polish Bolshevik who had lived in Stockholm for a while; The Ukrainian-Italian socialist leader Angelica Balabanoff, who lived and worked in Stockholm; and Yrj√∂ Sirola and Otto Kuusinen, two prominent Finnish communist leaders visited Ture Nerman in Stockholm several times. Nerman also corresponded with the American socialist leaders Eugene V. Debs, John Reed (who helped him write a book on the first World War (Folkhatet)) and the American communist leader Max Eastman, who provided Nerman with a subscription to The Liberator. In Soviet Russia Young Nerman At the end of the summer of 1918, Ture Nerman traveled together with Angelica Balabanoff and Anton Nilson to Bolshevik Russia. In Petrograd, Nerman was invited two visit the home of Zinoviev, who was the leader of the Petrograd Soviet. They knew each other from Zimmerwald. Zinoviev asked him: \\"When will you make revolution in Sweden?\\" Nerman replied modestly that they did not have a definitive date yet. The next day Nerman attended a rally outside the Winter Palace, in which Zinoviev and Balabanoff spoke to the red soldiers heading out to fight in the civil war. After spending some days in Petrograd, the trip continued to Moscow, where Nerman was greeted by Kamenev and his wife, the sister of Trotsky. Nerman was welcomed to live with the Kamenev family at the Kremlin. On 3 October, Nerman attended a grand meeting at the Bolshoi Theatre. Amongst the speakers were Sverdlov, Radek, Bukharin and the main speaker Trotsky. Lenin, who recently had been shot and wounded, could not attend, but his greetings were received with cheers and applause. Afterwards Nerman spoke briefly with Trotsky who was in a hurry to go out and fight in the Civil War the same night. Nerman mentioned that the Swedish press, and even the Social Democratic newspapers, wrote almost every day that the Soviet government was about to fall, but still it remained. \\"Yes,\\" answered Trotsky with a stern smile, \\"and we will remain.\\" The day after, Nerman got to sit down with Bukharin for a long interview, in which Bukharin expressed his optimism in the world revolution and socialist future. The same day he met with Alexandra Kollontay, the female Bolshevik leader, who later would be the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. Ture Nerman returned to Sweden through the Finnish archipelago in late October. The positive energies he had massed from his experience in revolutionary Russia were replaced with devastation after hearing of the failed German revolution of 1918/1919, and the murdering of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. Ture Nerman made his second trip to Russia with Otto Grimlund in the spring of 1920, where he got to meet with Lenin, this time as the guest, after having been the host in Stockholm April 1917. Upon returning to Sweden in the summer he learned about the death of his father. His family had tried to delay the funeral, but still he had missed it. Ture Nerman would make one more trip to Russia, in 1927. It was the tenth anniversary of the revolution. Lenin was dead now and things had started to change. Against Stalinism Ture Nerman condemned the rise of Stalinism in Russia, but when Zeth H√∂glund broke with the Communist Party in 1924, Ture Nerman remained, although less involved in the leadership. The party's new leadership was composed of Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg. In 1929 the Comintern made sure that the power of the Swedish Communist Party was taken over by the minority fraction of Stalinists led by Hugo Sill√©n. The majority of the party's members, the non-Stalinists, were expelled, including Ture Nerman, Karl Kilbom and Nils Flyg. The minority (Stalinists) seized the party's headquarter and its archives, but the majority (non-Stalinists) managed to keep control over the newspaper Politiken. The majority, under the leadership of Kilbom, tried to keep running a Swedish Communist Party independent from Moscow. In 1934 this party took the name Socialist Party (Socialistiska partiet). In 1931 Ture Nerman, 44 years old, was elected to the first chamber of the Riksdag, where he served till 1937 as a representative of the independent communist Party. When he held speeches in the chamber, he usually tried to make them into poems. In Franco's Spain In 1937, Ture Nerman and his friend August Sp√•ngberg, traveled to Spain where General Francisco Franco's National faction had taken power and a civil war was ravaging the country. They went through Nazi Germany and managed to get to Barcelona. The civil war was a chaos. At times the Stalinists were fighting the Trotskyists, and at other times the Anarchists were fighting everyone. The Nationalists under Francisco Franco benefited from the massive support of Nazi-Germany (financial and military: Legion Condor) and fascist Italy. On 3 May, serious fighting between the different leftist groups broke out in Barcelona, and Hotel Victoria, where the Swedes were staying, was caught in the crossfire which lasted for three days. At the same hotel, Ture Nerman for the first time met Willy Brandt, (the German Social Democrat who would later live in exile Sweden during World War II and after that become Chancellor of West Germany.) On 7 May, the fighting in Barcelona was over with more than 500 dead and over 1,500 wounded. Afterwards, by orders from the Comintern, Stalinist press all over the world would claim that the Swedish \\"Trotskyist Fascists\\" Ture Nerman and August Sp√•ngberg were the masterminds of the battle in Barcelona. Nerman wrote in his autobiography: \\"I was falsely accused by the Stalinists of being in a pact with Hitler. But in reality, not much more than a year later, Stalin himself would be in a pact with Hitler.\\" When he return home to Sweden from the chaos in Spain he was met by a chaos in his own Socialist Party, the independent communist party. Nils Flyg had taken power and expelled the former party leader Karl Kilbom. Flyg wanted Ture Nerman to stay but he didn't like the development of the party and left voluntarily. (A couple of years later, Nils Flyg would suddenly become pro-Nazi and take the Socialist Party with him on this new course.) For the next two years Ture Nerman was without a party and he also lost his seat in the Parliament. In 1939, choosing the date of First of May, Ture Nerman re-joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party. World War II On 20 April 1933, a couple of months after Hitler had taken power in Germany, Nerman stood up in the Swedish parliament and demanded that Sweden should grant asylum for all German Jews who would like to come. The issue was taken up for vote, but voted against. When World War II broke out in 1939 Sweden declared itself neutral, but Ture Nerman was not neutral. During the war, Ture Nerman was best known as the editor of Trots allt! (Despite Everything!), an anti-Nazi paper that caused furor at the German Embassy in Stockholm. Trots allt! also criticized the Swedish government for, out of fear of Hitler, allowing German troop transports through Sweden. At its peak, the weekly paper achieved a circulation of 66,000 in 1942. The paper borrowed its name from a text by Karl Liebknecht, Trotz alledem!,Marxists.org which he wrote on the day before he was murdered in 1919. At first the Swedish government didn't tolerate Trots Allt! since it broke with the neutrality. Many of Nerman's anti-war and anti- Nazi writings of this time were not allowed to be published by the censorship. Ture Nerman was even sentenced to jail for three months in the winter of 1939. But the paper was very popular and a lot of financial help came in from supporters. In 1940, Nerman was sentenced to three months in prison by Swedish authorities for writing an article in \\"Trots Allt!\\" where Nerman claimed that Hitler had ordered a 1939 bombing and assassination attempt in a M√ºnich beer cellar.https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi- bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=VEST19400111.2.11&srpos;=8&e;=-------en--20--1--txt- txIN-%22ture+nerman%22-------1 Nerman was a parliamentarian at the time of his conviction. One of Nerman's closest collaborators in those days was Israel Holmgren, who also was sentenced to jail. At the end of 1942, Ture Nerman ran into his former friend Nils Flyg in the streets of Stockholm. Nils Flyg who now had developed into a Nazi supporter. Nerman asked him: \\"What are you going to do now?\\" Flyg said: \\"I‚Äôm going to save Sweden ‚Äì and I‚Äôm going to save you too!\\" Ture Nerman gave him an ironic \\"Thank you.\\" They never saw each other again: only a couple of weeks later Nils Flyg died. On 7 May 1945 Nazi Germany finally surrendered. On 16 May, Ture Nerman went to the liberated Norway together with a group of Norwegian refugees returning from their exile in Sweden. Trots Allt! had been a great supporter of the Norwegian freedom struggle against the Nazi occupation and smuggled in illegal issues of the paper had been were popular amongst the Norwegians. The last years Ture Nerman's alley in Stockholm Ture Nerman had a seat in the parliament 1946-1953\\\\. He retired after that, at 67 years of age. For the next three years (1954 till 1957) Nerman served as publisher of the bimonthly magazine Kulturkontakt, a publication of the CIA-backed Congress of Cultural Freedom and the Svenska kommitt√©n f√∂r kulturens frihet (Swedish Committee for Cultural Freedom).\\"USA paid for propaganda in Sweden in the 1950s?\\".

The red Soviet flag with the hammer and the sickle outside his house in Blid√∂, an island in the Stockholm archipelago, was an ironic reference to his earlier beliefs. He died in 1969.

Just like with the Muong, many clothing items are purchased from the Th√°i. They mainly grow rice and ramie, and use hemp to make bags, hammocks and nets. In the northern communes of Ngh·ªá An, the stilt houses are identical to that of the Muong. In the South, however, they are in the Th√°i style. Subdivisions Th·ªï consists of various different ethnolinguistic groups. Qu√°n Vi Mi√™n (2013:12) lists the following branches. *H·ªç (Lao/Thai exonym for the Han Chinese) *K·∫πo (Keo) (Lao/Thai exonym for ethnic Kinh or Vietnamese) *M·ªçn (Mol) (M∆∞·ªùng autonym) *Cu·ªëi *ƒêan Lai *Ly H√† *T√†y Po·ªçng (Pho·ªçng, Po·ªçng, Ph·ªëng) (Lao exonym for the \\"Kh·∫°\\", or Mon-Khmer hill tribes) Languages Th·ªï is a heterogeneous group; thus, local groups have distinct languages. However, all of Th·ªï languages belong to Vietic branch . Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Ho√†nh (2009) classify Th·ªï languages into 5 groups base on their position in Vietic branch.‚ÄúNguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Ho√†nh. 2009.

Thus, Nguy·ªÖn (2009) identify them as dialects of a language. The speakers of this language reside mainly in Con Cu√¥ng and T∆∞∆°ng D∆∞∆°ng districts. It may also have close relation with Hung language (Toum) in Laos. * Cu·ªëi, Nguy·ªÖn (2009) pointed out that Cu·ªëi is a distinct language with Vietnamese, Muong and Po·ªçng-ƒêan Lai. This language have two dialects Cu·ªëi ChƒÉm in T√¢n H·ª£p commune (T√¢n K·ª≥ district) and Cu·ªëi N·∫øp (or Cu·ªëi L√†ng L·ª°) in Th√°i H√≤a town. Because of sharing 66% basic lexicon with Po·ªçng, Nguy·ªÖn (2009) proposed to group Cu·ªëi with T√†y Po·ªçng-ƒêan Lai to form a subbranch in Vietic, parallel to Vi·ªát-M∆∞·ªùng branch and Ch·ª©t branch. The position of Th·ªï languages in Vietic branch * M·ªçn and H·ªç, The two dialects share 98% basic lexicon and have a closer relation with M∆∞·ªùng languages than Cu·ªëi and Po·ªçng. They share 77%, 79% and 71% core lexicon with M∆∞·ªùng Bi language, M∆∞·ªùng ·ªêng language and Ngh·ªá An dialect of Vietnamese, respectively. Especially, M·ªçn and H·ªç are lexical closest with a M∆∞·ªùng language in Nh∆∞ Xu√¢n district (84%). Therefore, Nguy·ªÖn (2009) group them into a single language in Vi·ªát-M∆∞·ªùng branch which have a closer relation with M∆∞·ªùng languages. Masp√©ro (1912) named this language as Southern M∆∞·ªùng language * K·∫πo share 99% lexicon with Ngh·ªá An dialect of Vietnamese. Thus, Nguy·ªÖn(2009) classified K·∫πo as a dialect of Vietnamese or even a sub-dialect of Ngh·ªá An dialect * Th·ªï L√¢m La and Th·ªï Nh∆∞ Xu√¢n share respectively 94% and 95% basic lexicon with Ngh·ªá An dialect. However, Nguy·ªÖn (2009) argued that two Th·ªï languages experienced a different phonological innovation with Vietnamese. Thus, he place it into a grey area between being dialects of Vietnamese or being member languages of Viet-Muong branch (Ngu·ªìn has a similar status). Distribution As of 2009, 80% (59,579 persons) of all ethnic Th·ªï live in Ngh·ªá An Province, while 13% (9,652 persons) are found in Thanh H√≥a Province Qu√°n Vi Mi√™n (2013:11).

Origin France at this time was struggling to create a West African empire to rival the holdings of its powerful neighbor Britain. In 1854, General Louis Faidherbe was appointed Governor of Senegal and soon began an expansion of French interests into the interior savannahs of what is now Senegal and Mali. The expansion began by going up the Senegal River and establishing a series of forts.Crowder, Michael \\"History of French West Africa until Independence\\". In Oliver, Roland and Crowder, Michael, eds. (1990) Africa South of the Sahara London: Europa Publications, page 18 The army moved troops, cannon and other supplies by steamship where possible and overland where not. In 1848, Omar Tall launched his jihad against neighboring Malink√© regions. By 1855, his rapid expansion had led to several skirmishes with the French army. With the authorization of his ally, Khasso Queen Hawa Demba Diallo, Governor Faidherbe ordered a fort built at the Khasso town of Medina, not far from Kayes. The siege In April 1857, Omar Tall declared war against the Khasso kingdom, and marched on Fort Medina, their nearest outpost, with an army of between 15,000 and 20,000,, a reprint of the 1931 edition, being a translation of the author's Les noirs de L'Afrique, published in 1921; Civilizations n√©gro africaines, published in 1925; and part of Les n√®gres published in 1927. which included riflemen armed with French rifles. The fort at the time had about 7,000 inhabitants, with some French but mostly Khasso troops. Omar Tall laid siege to the fort and began a series of assaults that resulted in hundreds of casualties for the Toucouleur army. In the 97 days that followed, the defenders' food supplies soon ran low, and the fort was on the verge of surrendering when, in mid-July, Faidherbe arrived by steamboat with supplies and 500 reinforcements, breaking the siege. Consequences Following the relief of Fort Medina, Faidherbe signed a treaty with the Omar Tall gaining concessions for the French down to the Niger River. Realizing the difficulties of attacking the well-equipped French, Omar Tall turned his attention to the neighboring Bambara Empire, conquering most of its territory including its capital of S√©gou in 1861. However, the French continued to expand their West African presence, conquering S√©gou and the Toucouleur Empire less than thirty years after Omar Taal's death. Present-day Medine The Fort du Medine is open to the public. The Fort is located about 12 km east of Kayes on the \\"road to Bamako.\\" There is also an old railroad station and European-style cemetery with graves from the mid-19th century. The village population is around 1800 with a small market daily.

Liedtke, Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum\\"\\", p. 404 He was married twice; in 1641 with Cornelia, a sister of Abraham Furnerius, living in Rotterdam, and in 1657 with Margaretha van Rhijn from Amsterdam. Philip studied painting under his brother Jacob in Rotterdam. After his second marriage he moved to Amsterdam. According to the Dutch writer on art Arnold Houbraken, Koninck completed his training in Rembrandt‚Äôs studio in Amsterdam. In the late 1640s, De Koninck, began to paint panoramas, his canvases divided in half, horizontally, between equal measures of earth and sky. Koninck was evidently much affected by Rembrandt etchings like 'The Goldweigher's Field', which looked across a broad sweep of country layered with bands of shade and light. Also the style of Hercules Segers is to be detected in his work.https://www.museothyssen.org/en/collection/artists/koninck-philips Impressionable and single-minded, Philips Koninck began to paint like this for the next decade, almost all his panoramas pieced together as if narrow ribbons of darkness and brightness had been laid across the canvas. He was a great success, enough of one, at any rate, to buy and operate a barge line that ran between Amsterdam and Rotterdam via Leiden, so that his business could travel through his own landscapes.Rembrandt's Eyes, Simon Schrama, Alfred A. Knopf, Borzoi Books, New York 1999, p. 562 He painted chiefly broad, sunny landscapes, full of space, light and atmosphere; they are seen from a high perspective, allowing a prominent view of the sky. Portraits by him, somewhat in the manner of Rembrandt, also exist (e.g. see Joost van den Vondel); there are examples of these in the galleries at Copenhagen and Oslo. Of his landscapes, the principal are View at the mouth of a river at the Hague, with a slightly larger replica in the National Gallery, London; Woodland border and countryside (with figures by Adriaen van de Velde) at Amsterdam; and landscapes in Brussels, Florence (the Uffizi), Berlin and Cologne. Koninck, a prosperous businessman, living on Reguliersgracht, appears to have painted only a few pictures during the last decade of his life. Several of his works have been falsely attributed to Rembrandt and many more to his nephew Salomon de Koninck (1609‚Äì1656), a disciple of Rembrandt, whose paintings and etchings consist mainly of portraits and biblical scenes. He was also the uncle of the painters Jacob II and Daniel Koninck. All of these painters are to be distinguished from David Koninck (1636?-1687), also known as Rammelaar. David Koninck was born in Antwerp and studied there under Jan Fyt. He later settled in Rome, where he is stated to have died in 1687; this, however, is doubtful. His pictures are chiefly landscapes with animals and still life.

The logo above denotes a Shinto shrine dedicated to the kami Tenjin Various omamori from different shrines are Japanese amulets commonly sold at Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, dedicated to particular Shinto kami as well as Buddhist figures, and are said to provide various forms of luck or protection. Origin and usage The word mamori (ÂÆà„Çä) means protection, with omamori being the sonkeigo (honorific) form of the word. Originally made from paper or wood, modern amulets are small items usually kept inside a brocade bag and may contain a prayer, religious inscription of invocation. Omamori are available at both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples with few exceptions and are available for sale, regardless of one's religious affiliation. Omamori are then made sacred through the use of ritual, and are said to contain busshin (spiritual offshoots) in a Shinto context or kesshin (manifestations) in a Buddhist context. While omamori are intended for temple tourists' personal use, they are mainly viewed as a donation to the temple or shrine the person is visiting. Visitors often give omamori as a gift to another person as a physical form of well-wishing. Design and function An image an Omamori style Gohonzon distributed by Soka Gakkai for members during on travels away from home. The amulet covering is usually made of brocaded silk and encloses papers or pieces of wood with prayers written on them which are supposed to bring good luck to the bearer on particular occasions, tasks, or ordeals. Omamori are also used to ward off bad luck and are often spotted on bags, hung on cellphone straps, in cars, etc. Omamori have changed over the years from being made mostly of paper and/or wood to being made out of a wide variety of materials (i.e. bumper decals, bicycle reflectors, credit cards, etc.). Modern commercialism has also taken over a small part of the creations of omamori. Usually this happens when more popular shrines and temples cannot keep up with the high demand for certain charms. They then turn to factories to manufacture the omamori. However, priests have been known to complain about the quality and authenticity of the products made by factories. According to Yanagita Kunio (1969): Usage Another study-dedicated omamori, gakugy≈ç- j≈çju, in a keychain shrine in Kumamoto. This item claims to \\"grant protection\\" to the user. The logo above denotes the shrine Fujisaki Hachimang≈´ Omamori may provide general blessings and protection, or may have a specific focus such as: * k≈çts≈´-anzen: traffic safety‚Äîprotection for drivers and travelers of all sorts * yaku-yoke: avoidance of evil * kaiun: open luck, better fortune * gakugy≈ç-j≈çju: education and passing examinations‚Äîfor students and scholars * sh≈çbai-hanj≈ç: prosperity in business‚Äîsuccess in business and matters of money * en-musubi: acquisition of a mate and marriage‚Äîavailable for singles and couples to ensure love and marriage * anzan: protection for pregnant women for a healthy pregnancy and easy delivery * kanai-anzen: safety (well-being) of one's family, peace and prosperity in the household Customarily, omamori are not opened in order to avoid losing their protective benefits. They're carried on one's person, or tied to something like a backpack or a purse. It is not necessary, but amulets are customarily replaced once a year to ward off bad luck from the previous year. Old amulets are usually returned to the same shrine or temple they were purchased at so they can be disposed of properly. Amulets are commonly returned on or slightly after New Year‚Äôs. This way the shrine/temple visitor has a fresh start for the New Year with a new omamori. Old omamori traditionally should not be disposed of, but burned, as a sign of respect to the deity that assisted the person throughout the year. If a shrine or temple visitor cannot find an omamori that meets their need, they can request for a priest to have one made. If enough people request for this same type of omamori, the temple or shrine may start producing them for everyday availability. Modern commercial uses There are modern commercial versions for these that are typically not spiritual in nature and are not issued by a shrine or temple. It has become popular for stores in Japan to feature generic omamori with popular characters such as Mickey Mouse, Hello Kitty, Snoopy, Kewpie, etc. See also References Further reading * * External links * Omamori.com Category:Amulets Category:Talismans Category:Shinto Category:Buddhist religious objects Category:Religious objects Category:Shinto cult objects Category:Superstitions of Japan ","title":"Omamori"},{"id":"2173847","text":"The Curtiss XF14C was an American naval fighter aircraft. It was developed by Curtiss-Wright in response to a request by the United States Navy in 1941 to produce a new shipboard high-performance fighter aircraft. Design and development In 1941 the US Navy requested a better-performing carrier- based fighter plane, to be powered by the proposed high performance 24-cylinder liquid cooled Lycoming XH-2470 Hyper engine. This was an unusual step for the Navy, which had been adamant to that time that all its aircraft use air-cooled radial engines. On June 30, 1941 a contract for two prototype aircraft, designated the XF14C-1, was awarded to the Curtiss-Wright company. On the same date prototype development contracts were also awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation for the single-engine XF6F-1 and the twin engine XF7F-1, both of which would use air-cooled Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engines. Early in the development the Navy requested better altitude performance and, in view of unsatisfactory progress in the development of the XH-2470 engine, Curtiss adapted the design of the aircraft around the new turbocharged Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone air-cooled radial engine. The aircraft equipped with this eighteen-cylinder twin-row radial air- cooled engine and three bladed contra-rotating propellers was designated the XF14C-2. The XF14C-1 was canceled. Also, looking at the problems of operation at altitudes of about 40,000 feet (12,000 m), the Navy also initiated work on a third version with a pressurized cockpit designated the XF14C-3. Ultimately, only the XF14C-2 prototype was completed, flying for the first time in July 1944. Moreover, disappointment with performance estimates and delays with the availability of the XR-3350-16 engine coupled with the evaporating tactical need for an extremely high-altitude fighter led to cancellation of the development.

She was born in McMinnville, Tennessee, the daughter of judge Richard Marshall Fristoe and Mary L. Fristoe. (n√©e Sullivan) She married Henry Washington Younger in about 1830 and bore 14 children from 1832 to 1857. Throughout the 1860s she suffered many tragedies; in 1862 Henry was shot dead. He was brought home and buried in an unmarked grave. Also the Younger boys were being targeted because of Cole's involvement with the Missouri guerillas. After she was forced to leave her house and she witnessed her son John kill a man, the family moved to Texas. By this time Bersheba had become quite ill, so they brought her back to Lee's Summit, Missouri, to die. Some men recognized John and Bob Younger as Cole's brothers, they knocked Bob unconscious and took John out back and hung him 4 times, hitting him until he was unconscious.

He did not play in the 1969 regular season but was on the roster for the 1969 AFL Championship Game. At 6 foot 10 inches tall, Stroud is believed to have been the tallest tight end, and the second tallest player at any position, in the history of the NFL. As a student at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia, the Miami, Florida-born Stroud was a center and power forward on the Panthers' basketball team. Despite Stroud having little experience in football, Chiefs head coach Hank Stram selected him in the third round of the 1969 NFL Draft as a tight end. In five seasons between 1970 and 1974, Stroud caught 54 passes for 977 yards, seven touchdowns, and averaged 18.1 yards per reception. However, Stroud became a notable special teams player‚Äîspecifically at blocking field goals. On many opponents' field goal attempts, Stroud lined up under the goalposts and tried to deflect the ball as it came down. Later rule changes led to the adoption of Rule 12, Section 3, Article 1 (informally known as the \\"Stroud Rule\\"): \\"Goal tending by any player leaping up to deflect a kick as it passes above the crossbar of a goal post is prohibited. The referee may award 3 points for a palpably unfair act\\". Stroud died on October 17, 2016 in Kansas City, Missouri.

Retrieved 22 August 2013 He joined the Swedish Social Democratic Party and in 1916 was elected to the Riksdag. But in 1917 Str√∂m broke with Hjalmar Branting and sided with the far-left of the party headed by the communists Zeth H√∂glund and Ture Nerman. This group supported the Russian Bolsheviks and would soon become the (original) Swedish Communist Party. Fredrik Str√∂m was, together with Ture Nerman and Stockholm's mayor Carl Lindhagen, part of a small delegation of Swedish communists who greeted Lenin during his short visit in Stockholm in April 1917. The Swedish Communists took Lenin to the PUB department store where they bought him a brand new suit so he would look good returning home to revolutionary Petrograd. Str√∂m was head of the Stockholm Comintern liaison with Western Europe from 1919‚Äì1920, and he frequently visited the Soviet Union for meetings including the third congress of the Communist International, held in Moscow in 1921.

Sturm's critique was aimed at Leibniz's view that Nature and/or its constituent parts possess some creative force of their own. This criticism was partly theological, in that Sturm claimed Leibniz's view of Nature undermined the sovereignty of the Christian God.Gottfried Leibniz, Philosophical Papers and Letters, ed. by Leroy Loemker, (Dordrecht, Holland: D.

As a batsman Gaekwad \\"possessed a sure defence and delightfully crisp shots especially through the covers\\". He was also an occasional leg spin bowler. As of 2018, he is India's oldest living Test cricketer. Biography Gaekwad played his early cricket for Bombay University and the Maharaja Sayaji University in Baroda. He made his Test debut in the first Test of 1952 tour of England, in Leeds. He opened the innings for India despite never having done so before the tour. He was one among four victims dismissed for no score in the second innings of the Test. His West Indies tour in the next year was terminated during the second Test when he collided with Vijay Hazare while going for a catch and dislocated his shoulder. In 1956‚Äì58, he captained Baroda to their first Ranji title in nine years. He scored a double hundred against the defending champions Bombay during the course of the season. This was followed by a recall to the Indian team for the final Test against West Indies in 1958‚Äì59. His 52 in the second innings was the only fifty of his career and went some way towards India earning a draw. With Hemu Adhikari, who had captained in this match, being unavailable, Gaekwad led the Indian team to the tour of England in 1959. India lost all the five matches and Gaekwad did not appear in another Test. In Ranji Trophy, he scored 3139 runs with 14 centuries and a highest of 249 against Maharashtra in 1959‚Äì60.

Together with its preparatory school and nursery at Brandeston Hall, it serves pupils from 3 to 18 years of age. History Prince Albert by John Partridge, 1840. Royal Collection. Framlingham College was originally called The Albert Middle Class College in Suffolk in memory of Prince Albert and was founded in 1864 by public subscription as the Suffolk County Memorial to Queen Victoria's husband, Albert, Prince Consort, and was incorporated by Royal Charter. The individuals most involved in setting up of the school were Sir Edward Kerrison, 2nd Baronet, Richard Garrett and the Earl of Stradbroke. The land on which the college was built was originally part of the Castle estate, left by Sir Robert Hitcham in 1636 to Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. The architect was Fredrick Peck of Furnival's Inn, London. Built to accommodate 300 boys, the college opened its doors to pupils on 10 April 1865. In J. R. de S. Honey's book Tom Brown's Universe: Public School in the Nineteenth Century, he reviewed the 64 leading public schools of the time and classified Framlingham as being in 'Group 4' of these schools, considering it to be a school that interacted less than it should with other leading schools. During 1940, because of Framlingham's position close to the Suffolk coast (a likely site for a possible German invasion), and as a result of the crisis unfolding at Dunkirk, pupils from the college were evacuated for a short time to Repton School in Derbyshire. The college's prep school at Brandeston Hall was opened by Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone in July 1949. The hall had been purchased and restored by The Society of Old Framlinghamians as a memorial to those of their number who \\"in two Great Wars gave their lives for the freedom of the world\\". The school Framlingham College Brandeston Hall Louise North became Principal of Framlingham College and Head of the Senior School in September 2019. She was formerly Senior Deputy Head at Oakham School, Rutland. The school received an excellent ISI Inspection Report in February 2015 and an Outstanding Ofsted report in February 2011. Pupils are accommodated in seven boarding and day houses: three for girls and four for boys. The facilities at Framlingham College include a theatre with tiered seating for 250, a design and technology centre, a music department including various studios and recording facilities, a library, a Sixth form centre which opened in 2014, a leisure centre that houses an indoor swimming pool, a fitness suite and weights room. The original library, which was given to the college by Charles H. Berners, Esq. DL in 1899, was extended in 1998. The school has two campuses situated on approximately 135 acres. The college campus sits in an elevated position and looks directly across to the 12th-century Framlingham Castle beyond. Between the college and the castle lies the 34-acre Framlingham Mere, owned by the college and managed by Suffolk Wildlife Trust. The Mere is a nature reserve. The prep school campus at Brandeston Hall is a mock tudorbethan hall set in its own grounds and faces the medieval Church of All Saints, Brandeston. Education The most recent ISI inspection (2015) adjudged the teaching and learning at the college as 'Excellent'. Sport View of the school from the nearby Framlingham Castle, the eponymous 'Castle on the Hill'. Framlingham College campus includes an indoor swimming pool, multi-gym, weights room and large playing fields. Other facilities include a modern sports hall, two floodlit artificial hockey pitches, indoor rifle range, tennis, netball and squash courts. As well as its own golf course on site, home matches are played at Aldeburgh Golf Club. The cricket square hosted an England XI in 2010. Framlingham College featured in The Cricketer magazine's Top 100 Cricketing Schools for 2016. The major sports are rugby, hockey, cricket, athletics and tennis for boys, and hockey, netball and tennis for girls. The girls also have a cricket team and have an annual fixture against the MCC.

The village has been described as \\"a quaint English drinking village, with a fishing problem\\"; is a popular bathing place and is characterised by Georgian architecture. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 1,762. Its northern boundary follows the Teign estuary and its eastern boundary the English Channel. The village is part of the electoral ward of Shaldon and Stokeinteignhead, with a population in 2011 of 2,465.  History  Shaldon was in the hundred of Wonford. The original river settlement was upstream in Ringmore where the valley was farmed, and the inhabitants were hidden from the sea. Up to the beginning of the 20th century, Ringmore had many working farms, extensive apple and other orchards, including cider apples, watercress beds, and withy beds used for making lobster pots. There were also shipbuilding and repair yards on the waterfront. Shaldon itself is built on reclaimed land, and there is a retaining wall, built around 1800, to prevent the river returning to its beaches. In 2012 a beach hut measuring 23 ft by 6 ft at Shaldon was put on the market for ¬£245,000 and was at that time thought to be the most expensive beach hut in the UK.  Local government  Shaldon is part of Teignbridge local government district, which was created in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The village had previously been in St Nicholas Parish. The parish contained Shaldon and part of the adjacent village of Ringmore, and became part of Teignmouth Urban District in 1881.  Regatta  The Shaldon regatta is one of the oldest in England dating back to at least 1817, if not before. The modern regatta runs for 9 days each August.  Homeyards Botanical Gardens  \\"Shaldon Castle\\", a folly in Homeyards Botanical Gardens On a hillside above the village are gardens created by Maria 'Laetitia' Kempe Homeyard in the late 1920s and early 1930s and built by Thomas Rider, consisting of an informal terraced arboretum with a level walk along the top providing views of the Teign estuary and the Jurassic Coast.

(The recording did not include most of the music written by Gershwin which had been customarily cut from productions in the United States, however. As opposed to the complete three- hour opera, the album was two hours and nine minutes.) The recording came about as a result of Lehman Engel and Goddard Lieberson's desire to record albums of Broadway shows whose scores had never been put on disc. Among the musicals the team had recorded (or would record) were Oh, Kay!, Babes in Arms, Girl Crazy, and Pal Joey. Although there had been an album of Porgy and Bess since 1940, there had never been a 3-LP version. The 1951 album set contained more than two-thirds of the opera, for the first time ever in the history of recording. The album was recorded between April 5 and April 13, 1951. The album was originally released on 3 twelve-inch 33 rpm LPs. Columbia Masterworks assigned the album the catalog number OSL 162. The recording was later remastered by Naxos Records and re-released on CD. Several members of the original Broadway cast of Porgy and Bess appeared on the album.

It is the administrative center of Sahiwal (Montgomery) District and Sahiwal (Montgomery) Division. It is the 21st largest city of Pakistan by population. Sahiwal is approximately 180 km from the major city Lahore and 100 km from Faisalabad and lies between Lahore and Multan. A small village on the Karachi-Lahore railway line during 1865 was named Montgomery after Sir Robert Montgomery. Later, it was made the capital of the Montgomery District and its name was reinstated as Sahiwal in 1966 and the district council bilaterally approved the usage of both names, 'Montgomery' and 'Sahiwal', for performing the official and unofficial administrative tasks. The city is in the densely populated region between the Sutlej and Ravi rivers. The principal crops are wheat, cotton, tobacco, legumes, potato and oil seeds. Cotton goods and lacquered woodwork are manufactured. History The Sahiwal District has been settled from the pre-historical era. Harappa is an archaeological site, about west of Sahiwal, that was built approximately 2600 BCE. The area was part of Indian empires and in crossroads of migrations and invasions from Central Asia. The pastoral tribes of this barren expanse did not appear to have paid more than a nominal allegiance to the Muslim rulers, the population for the most part remained in a chronic state of rebellion. Sahiwal is located close to Pakpattan, a famous medieval town and Muslim Sufi pilgrimage site. Pakpattan owes its sanctity and modern name, 'the holy ferry', to the shrine of the great Muslim Sufi Fariduddin Ganjshakar Shaikh-ul-Islam, Farid-ul-Hakkwa-ud-Din, Shakar Ganj (1173‚Äì1265) which was visited by old great traveler and historian Ibn Batuta in 1334. The native population converted to Islam by Sufi missionaries. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh took control of Sahiwal. The inhabitants were treated benevolently during Sikh rule. The district came under direct British rule in 1849, when the district was officially formed with its headquarters at Pakpattan. The district was expanded to include the trans-Ravi portion in 1852, and the district headquarters were moved to Gogera. In 1865, when the railway was opened, a village on the railway side, was named \\"Montgomery\\" and became the capital of the district. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, there was a general uprising of the Muslim population of Sahiwal, and the district formed the scene of the only uprising which took place north of Sutlej. Before the end of May 1857, emissaries from Delhi crossed the river from Sirsa and Hisar, where open rebellion was already ripe, and met with a ready reception from the Kharals and various other Muslim tribes. The district authorities, however, kept down the threatened uprising till August 26, 1857 when the prisoners in jail made a desperate attempt to break loose. At the same time Ahmad Khan, a famous Kharal leader, who had been detained at Gogera, broke his arrest, and though apprehended, was released on security, together with several other suspected chieftains. On September 16, they fled to their homes, and the whole country rose in open rebellion. Kot Kamalia was sacked; and Major Chamberlain, moving up with a small force from Multan, was besieged for some days at Chichawatni on the Ravi. The situation at the civil station remained critical till Colonel Paton arrived with substantial reinforcements from Lahore. An attack which took place immediately after their arrival was repulsed. Several minor actions followed in the open field, until finally the rebels, driven from the plain into the jungles of the interior, were utterly defeated and dispersed. The British troops then inflicted severe punishment on the insurgent clans, destroying their villages, and seizing large numbers of herds. The district council authorised that the name be changed from Montgomery to Sahiwal in 1966. Sahiwal has an important new railway station. Climate The climate of Sahiwal district is extreme, reaching 34 ¬∞C in summer, and down to 4 ¬∞C in winter. The soil of the district is very fertile. The average rainfall is about 2000 mm.

Holthuis was born in Probolinggo, East Java and obtained his doctorate from Leiden University on 23 January 1946. He was appointed the assistant curator of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (now Naturalis) in Leiden in 1941. He was the most prolific carcinologist of the 20th century, publishing 620 papers (108 of which were in the Leiden Museum Journals) totalling 12,795 pages which is an average of 185 pages per year and an average of approximately 21 pages per paper. These were published on many groups of crustaceans, their natural history and nomenclature, and the history of carcinology. This steady stream of publications resulted in the description of 428 new taxa: 2 new families, 5 subfamilies, 83 genera and 338 species. 67 taxa were named after him between 1953 (Hippolyte holthuisi) and 2009 (Caridina holthuisi, Lysmata holthuisi). However, in Fransen, C.H.J.M., De Grave, S., Ng, P.K.L. 2010, an additional 50 taxa were named after him.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WZPX-TV's offices are located on Horizon Drive on the southeastern side of Grand Rapids, and its transmitter is located on South Norris Road in Orangeville Township. Until 2019, the station's transmitter was located in Vermontville Township in western Eaton County (in the Lansing market). History WZPX first signed on the air on October 11, 1996, as WJUE, carrying infomercials for most of the day as part of Paxson Communications' inTV service, along with programming from the United Paramount Network (UPN) as a secondary affiliation. The station's original licensee was Horizon Broadcasting Corporation, which Paxson Communications acquired before the station's sign-on. When Paxson bought WBSX-TV in Ann Arbor (now WPXD-TV), WJUE was spun off to DP Media, a sister company because of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ownership rules in effect at the time. WBSX's transmitter was located near Chelsea in northwestern Washtenaw County, which was close enough to the Ingham County line to give WBSX city-grade coverage of Lansing. Jackson, the second-largest city in the Lansing market, also got a fairly strong signal from WBSX. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow common ownership of stations with overlapping signals, and would not even consider granting a waiver for a city-grade overlap. Even though the two stations were in different markets, the FCC ruled that WJUE and WBSX were effectively a duopoly, forcing WJUE's sale. However, Paxson continued to operate the station under a local marketing agreement (LMA). Within a year, the station changed its call letters to WILV. On August 31, 1998, the station became a charter affiliate of Pax TV, and changed its call letters to the current WZPX-TV. One year later, on August 31, 1999, UPN programming moved to Grand Rapids-based WXSP-CA (channel 15). On October 6 of that year, WZPX became a secondary affiliate of The WB. UPN would later find an affiliate in Lansing on WHTV (channel 18) on October 16, 2000. During this time, the network's Detroit owned-and-operated station WKBD-TV was carried as an out-of- market signal on local cable providers. In 2000, when the FCC relaxed its ownership rules to allow ownership of stations with overlapping coverage, Paxson repurchased the station outright. As UPN, WB and Pax TV all offered prime time programming on weekdays, WZPX had scheduling conflicts during its affiliations with the former two networks. It carried the Pax programs on the same days and times as other stations, programs from UPN delayed to 11 p.m. and midnight, respectively, and programs from The WB on a one-day delay, two hours before prime time. For example, WB primetime programs that aired on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. in other markets aired on Wednesdays at 6 p.m. on WZPX; promotional spots for these programs announced their local time slots. The station carried a brief announcement when switching between programs from the differing networks. The Disney's One Too/UPN Kids blocks ran on weekday mornings, while Kids' WB ran on weekday afternoons; the Kids' WB Saturday block still aired on Saturday mornings. The Pax programming bumped from the afternoon slot simply moved earlier in the day in place of infomercials that would normally air in that slot at the time. In part, because the station had the added draw of UPN and later WB programming, WZPX was at one point one of Pax TV's highest-rated affiliates. Despite the large signal overlap between WZPX and WPXD, Lansing-area cable providers opted to carry WZPX as the Ion Television station since its signal was broadcast closer from Vermontville Township, within the Lansing television market. WPXD has since moved its transmitter to a tower in Southfield; as a result, its signal no longer covers Lansing or Jackson. Due to the closure of The WB on September 17, 2006, WZPX became solely an Ion owned-and-operated station (The CW and MyNetworkTV chose to affiliate with subchannels of WWMT and WXSP-CD, respectively, allowing full prime time carriage of their schedules).CW Adds Seven More Affiliates, Broadcasting & Cable, April 4, 2006.My LIN TV: 4 More For New Fox Net, Broadcasting & Cable, April 26, 2006. =Possible sale to Scripps= On September 24, 2020, the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company announced that it would purchase Ion Media for $2.65 billion, with financing from Berkshire Hathaway. With this purchase, Scripps will divest 23 Ion-owned stations, but no announcement has been made as to which stations that Scripps will divest as part of the move. The proposed divestitures will allow the merged company to fully comply with the FCC local and national ownership regulations. Scripps has agreed to a transaction with an unnamed buyer, who has agreed to maintain Ion affiliations for the stations. If Scripps decides to keep WZPX-TV, this would make it a sister station to Fox affiliate WXMI (channel 17).http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/09/24/scripps-creates-national- television-networks-business-with-acquisition-of-ion- media-395300/20200924scripps01/E.W.

The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 43, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44, using PSIP to display WZPX-TV's virtual channel as 43 on digital television receivers.

Lali drums are now used to call the people of an area together, such as church services; the Lali is also used to entertain guests at many hotel resorts. The Lali drum is made out of wood and played with hands but, is most commonly played with sticks (i uaua) which are made out of softer wood so as not to damage the Lali. Historically, a larger and smaller stick were used together when playing the Lali.Ewins, R. 1982. Fijian Artefacts; Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery Collection. Lali drums were traditionally made from resonant timbers such as Ta vola (Terminalia catappa) and Dilo (Calophyllum inophyllum) or in the case of sacred drums for spirit houses, Vesi (Calophyllum inophyllum).

This album included a wider range of sounds ‚Äì funk, pop, disco and ballads. While the album contained no major hits it did include \\"Got Tu Go Disco\\", the title song from the short-lived Broadway musical. The 12\\" single peaked at No. 67 on the US Dance Charts. In 1979 Brooks branched out from disco by singing \\"Close Enough For Love\\", the title song to the Vanessa Redgrave movie Agatha. By 1980, when a disco backlash had hit the industry in the US, Brooks's fourth and last Casablanca offering, Pattie Brooks, was more of a pop-soul affair, produced this time by Michael Smith. No hits were forthcoming, and Brooks left Casablanca.  Post-disco activity  She returned in 1982 on the Mirage label with a fifth album, In My World, produced by Sandy Linzer. The album reflected the popular styles of the time, and produced a moderate club hit with the dance-rock tinged \\"Dr. Ruth\\" and a minor R&B; hit with the ballad \\"Every Time I Turn Around\\". The album was remastered and released as a compact disc on the Funky Town Grooves label in 2009. This turned out to be Brooks's last album, although she remained active in terms of one-off singles. In 1983 she was signed by Backstreet Records, releasing the minor club hit \\"Get It On And Have A Party\\". She was featured prominently on the soundtrack to the film Doctor Detroit, including two duets with its star Dan Aykroyd. In 1985 Brooks released \\"Lifeline Dancing\\" on the Easy Street label, which was featured in the Emilio Estevez movie That Was Then... This Is Now. In 1987 she surfaced on West Holly Records with \\"All Talk\\", and in 1988 on Waterwheel Records with the maxi-single \\"Function at the Junction\\". Following these one-off releases, Brooks returned to backup vocalist sessions and the occasional advertising jingle (most notably 1985's \\"Nature Valley Granola's Dandy Bar\\"). She has returned to making club appearances, including a spot at L.A.'s \\"Don't Tell Mama\\" in November 2013.  Recent activity  In 1993, producer Rick Gianatos remade Brooks's greatest hit, \\"After Dark.\\" It was released on a vinyl 12\\" single b/w \\"Sweet Temptation.\\" In 2006 Gianatos issued a CD single of \\"After Dark\\" on his Nu & Improved label with up to the minute remixes. The single was well received and spent several weeks on the US club play chart. A pairing with Gianatos again in 2011 produced the track \\"It's All About The Music,\\" also released on the Nu & Improved label. This was available on two compact discs, one featuring the U.S remixes and another with the U.K. remixes. There were also download-only remixes, entitled \\"The Soul Mixes.\\" Once again Brooks was well received and had moderate chart success. In 2013 Gianatos recorded the new dance track \\"I Like The Way You Move\\" with Brooks. The track featured backing vocals by Scherrie Payne (former \\"Supreme\\") and Joyce Vincent Wilson and Pamela Vincent (of \\"Tony Orlando & Dawn\\" fame). This was released as a \\"Bonus-Exclusive\\" on the compilation First Ladies of Disco ‚Äì Rick Gianatos Presents the Music. Also in 2013, Brooks was included in the book The First Ladies Of Disco. On April 19, 2014, the video and CD-single (with ten mixes) of \\"I Like The Way You Move\\" were released. The video features a star-studded cast, including Scherrie Payne, Charlo Crossley and Peggi Blu. Brooks' daughter Yvette (Marine) Barlow was a member of the Mary Jane Girls.
