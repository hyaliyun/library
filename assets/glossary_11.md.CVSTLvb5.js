Early life and education  Saleni Armstrong was born in London, Ontario, the daughter of William Leonard Armstrong and Elizabeth Summers Armstrong. Her father was a Union Army surgeon during the American Civil War. She was raised in Michigan and Nebraska. Armstrong attended Northwestern University for a year, and graduated from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1885, with an internship in gynecology and obstetrics at the Philadelphia Lying-in Charity Hospital. She also studied at Mount Vernon Institute of Elocution and Languages.  Career  Armstrong founded and ran an orphanage in Platte County, Nebraska, as a young doctor. She became a medical missionary in India as a single woman in 1886, serving with her sister Willimina L. Armstrong, and later with her husband, Methodist clergyman George Armstrong-Hopkins. She founded and directed a hospital and a nurses' training school at Khetwadi from 1887 to 1889. She was physician in charge at Lady Atchison Hospital in Lahore and a hospital in Hyderabad, Sindh from 1889 to 1893. From 1893 to 1895, she was on the staff of a hospital in Omaha. She sponsored several Indian students to attend college in the United States. The Armstrong-Hopkinses went to Bombay in 1912; she retired from the mission field after her husband's death in 1918. In 1899, Armstrong-Hopkins sued her superior, Methodist bishop James Mills Thoburn, for slander. She sued him again in 1907 for libel, and won an award of $500. Thoburn had claimed that Armstrong-Hopkins was spending lavishly on dresses, stockings, shoes, and hats for her Indian patients. She held a medical license in Nebraska from 1894, but was refused a license to practice in Washington, D. C. in 1903, when the district's board of medical supervisors questioned her credentials and asked her to sit for an examination. Books by Armstrong-Hopkins included Within the Purdah (1898), Fruit of Suffering (a book of poems), Pork and Mustard, and Khetwadi Castle (1900). She gave lectures on her experiences in India to women's groups and at church events.  Personal life  In 1893, Saleni Armstrong married George Franklin Hopkins (1855-1918), as his second wife. They both used the surname Armstrong-Hopkins after they married, and their legal change to the hyphenated surname made headlines in 1905. In 1926, she was on a list of \\"Lost Alumnae\\" of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania; her alumnae association had lost track of her address. Her younger sister WIllimina Leonora Armstrong was known later in life as Zamin Ki Dost, a physician, writer, and lecturer on Eastern mysticism, based in Los Angeles.

Japan's history of having human-made roads ranging from the present to the J≈çmon period. The Gokishichid≈ç of the Asuka period and the Edo period kaid≈ç both figured into the government's attempts to centralize their authority. As of April 2012, Japan had a road network of approximately of roads made up of of city, town and village roads, of prefectural roads, of national highways, and of expressways. Highway systems As of April 2012, Japan had a road network of approximately of roads made up of of city, town, and village roads, of prefectural roads, of national highways, and of expressways. =Roadside stations= A is a government- designated rest area. Not to be confused with the service areas found along the country's expressways, the roadside stations are found along the national and prefectural highways of Japan. They serve as places for travelers to rest and they are also intended to promote local tourism and trade. Shops within them often sell local produce, snacks, souvenirs, and other goods. All roadside stations provide 24-hour access to parking, public toilets and facilities for sharing information. As of September 2020, there are 1,180 roadside stations across Japan: 128 in Hokkaido, 165 in the T≈çhoku area, 180 in the Kant≈ç region, 82 in the Hokuriku region, 135 in the Chubu area, 149 in the Kinki area, 107 in the Chugoku area, 88 in the Shikoku area, and 146 in the Kyushu region. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism conducted an experiment at 13 roadside stations across the country from 2017 to 2018 to test the feasibility of having self-driving cars carry people and products to and from homes within a range of from roadside stations. Numbering Each level of the Japanese road network has its own numbering scheme. For national and prefectural routes, numbers of lower value indicate greater significance to the system. In the national highway network, highways with values 1 to 57 were originally established as the Primary National Highways, routes with three-digit numbers were established later and the earliest of those were originally called Secondary National Highways. The distinction between the primary and secondary highways was dropped in 1965 and now the national highways are all referred to officially as General National Highways. The only highway to be given a two digit number since the creation of the Primary National Highways is National Route 58, which connects the capital cities Kagoshima and Naha of Kagoshima Prefecture and Okinawa Prefecture, the latter of which was occupied during the creation of the system. It was added to the system shortly after the handover of the Ryukyu Islands from the United States to Japan. The national and regional expressways follow their own numbering scheme that was implemented in 2016. The first two group of expressways are numbered with the letter E followed by a number. The second of these two groups has the letter A appended to the designation to indicate that it a route related to the non-appended route. The numerical value chosen for these expressways generally matches the number of a pre- exisisting national highway that parallels the expressway. An example of this layout is that National Route 4 travels from Tokyo to Aomori. It is paralleled by the T≈çhoku Expressway, so it was numbered E4. The Hachinohe Expressway is a spur route of the T≈çhoku Expressway, so it was numbered E4A alongside several other routes, due to their relation to the T≈çhoku Expressway. As of September 2020, there are no expressways designated with numerical values greater than 98. Expressways falling between the numbers 59 and 98 were given numbers that don't match any existing national highways to prevent any route from having a three-digit numerical value. The final grouping of national and regional expressways are beltways, they are numbered with the letter C followed by a number rather than E like the other expressways. An exception to the rules is found in the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line which is numbered CA. History =Prehistory= The initial development of roads in Japan can be traced back to the J≈çmon period. The remains of a man-made road were uncovered at the Sannai-Maruyama site that was occupied between 3900 ‚Äì 2200 BC. Archaeologists uncovered a and road at the site that linked the ancient settlement to the sea. =Feudal period= The existence of a road network in Japan as early as the 3rd century is noted in the Chinese Records of the Three Kingdoms. The first Japanese written record of a road in Japan was created in 720 when the Yamanobe Road was written about in the Nihon Shoki. Established sometime during the Asuka period, the Yamanobe Road was a narrow path that linked the cities of Osaka and Nara. The Gokishichid≈ç of the Asuka period and the Edo period kaid≈ç both figured into the government's attempts to centralize their authority. =Meiji period to World War II= The kaid≈ç of the Edo period were still in service at the onset of the Meiji period, however, the roads were never intended to be used by wheeled vehicles and they rapidly broke down under the additional strain. Some of the pressure was taken off of the strained road network by the Meiji government's decision to prioritize the rail and sea networks over the roads. The was enacted in 1919, establishing a classification of five categories of roads under the control of the national government: national roads, prefectural roads, district roads, city roads, and municipal roads. It also reorganized the existing national roads. District roads were redesignated as prefectural roads on 1 April 1923 after the district was removed as level of government administration. =Allied occupation to present= Edobashi Junction in central Tokyo After the end of the occupation, just 14 percent of all roads in Japan were paved. By 1965 that percentage had increased to 57, and further by 1975 when 79 percent of roads were paved. As of 2018, over 90 percent of roads and highways in Japan have been paved. Since 1954 Japan has invested in a series of five-year plans to improve its roads and highways. Expenditures from these plans have steadily increased from the initial 308.6 billion yen being spent in the first plan to 65.3 trillion yen in the most recent plan. In April 1956 the Japan Highway Public Corporation was established by the national government with the task of constructing and managing a nationwide network of expressways. In 1957 permission was given to the corporation to commence construction of the Meishin Expressway linking the cities of Nagoya and Kobe, the first section of which opened to traffic in 1963. Road passenger and freight transport expanded considerably during the 1980s as private ownership of motor vehicles greatly increased along with the quality and reach of the nation's roads. Bus companies, including the JR Bus company, operate long-distance bus services on the nation's expanding expressway network. In addition to relatively low fares and deluxe seating, the buses are well utilized because they continue service during the night, when air and train services are limited. The cargo sector grew rapidly in the 1980s, recording 274.2 billion tonne-kilometers in 1990. The freight handled by motor vehicles, mainly trucks, in 1990, was over 6 billion metric tons, accounting for 90 percent of domestic freight tonnage and about 50 percent of tonne-kilometers.

Location  Blackbutt Reserve is located between New Lambton and Kotara. The north and west of the reserve is on Lookout Road and the south is on Carnley Avenue. Since the 1960s, captive animals were displayed, and barbecues and picnic tables were gradually added. In 2014, after the discovery of an old mine shaft, the Carnley Avenue Recreation Area was added. The park is also known as Richley Reserve - named after Joe Richley, the president of the Northern Parks and Playground Movement, who was very involved in preservation of the reserve. The site currently covers 152 hectares, with the northern end being to sold to create the Newcastle Regional Art Gallery.  History  The area of Blackbutt Reserve was originally a coal mine owned by the Scottish-Australian Mining Company. In 1824, the Australia Agricultural Company found coal on the northern ridge. In 1825, the first underground mine called \\"B\\" pit started. Mining commenced in 1863. In 1899, the site was owned by Borehill Colliery. Between 1915 and 1928, S.A.M Company sold small subdivisions in Lambton, New Lambton and Kotara. During the 1920s, the RSL had purchased an 80-hectare lot on the southern end to create market gardens for soldiers affected by PTSD, but the project failed and the land was sold to Lambton Municipal council. In 1932, an auction was held on the land, with only 5 of 52 lots being sold. In 1934, Joe Richley, president of the Northern Parks and Playground movement, persuaded New Lambton Council to purchase 6 hectares of bushland. In 1937, New Lambton Council purchased two adjoining 80 acres blocks, making a total land area of 240 acres. Parliament passed the Municipal Amalgamation Act 1 in 1938, which allowed small councils to be merged into one larger authority. The land was placed in trusteeship by Newcastle City Council in 1938. The 1938, 17 acres were purchased on Lookout Road. In 1940, Blackbutt Reserve was 144 acres. In 1949, part of Blackbutt Reserve was cut off due to the expansion of Carnley Road. In 1956, Newcastle CIty Council purchased another 270 acres from the S.A.M company. In 1958 part of Blackbutt Reserve was damaged by fire and the introduction of exotic plant species such as lantana. In 1963, Newcastle City Council began the Blackbutt program as an effort to restore the reserve after it was overtaken by weeds. In 1985, the mining pit was closed and the land was given to Newcastle City Council for residential use. In 1993, the old mine site was renovated and then reopened for public use by Lord Mayor Joy Cummings; it was renamed Richley Reserve.  Highway No.23  In 1966, it was announced that Highway No.23 was proposed to be built through the middle of Blackbutt Reserve. In July 1966, Newcastle City COuncil held a meeting to discuss the Department of Main Roads announcement. After much public protest, the Federal Government appointed a committee to examine the environmental impacts of Highway 23 on 23 July 1974. The report recommended that the Highway 23 project did not progress due to its environmental impact including disruption to bird life, impact on trees, reduced soil quality and noise pollution.  Other proposed projects  In the 1940s, it was suggested that it be called King George V Park or Duke of Windsor Reserve. In 1950s, a large zoo similar to Taronga Park was proposed. The Northern Parks and Playgrounds movement become involved at Blackbutt Reserve in 1953 after rumours of the possibility of establishing a bowling club at the lookout. In 1956, Newcastle City Council wanted to divide the northern part of Blackbutt Reserve into a housing division but, due to public protest, this project was abandoned. In 1958 a Newcastle City Council announced a sub-division but due to pressure by the Northern Parks and Playgrounds Movement and 79 other organisations, it was abandoned. In 1960s, it was suggested to make the site of the Hunter Valley Botanical Gardens. In 1963, the Department of Education announced a plan to purchase a part of the reserve to a build high school but, due to a campaign led by the Northern Parks and Playgrounds Movement, the minister announced that none of Blackbutt Reserve was going to used as a high school. In 1970s, it was suggested to make the site a private school. In the 1990s, it was suggested to build a 60-meter observation tower.

Life  = Early life in Ireland = Craig's childhood home, Frescati House Craig was born in 1805 in Blackrock, Dublin, where his father Robert, a Scot, was managing a boys' school in Frescati House.. He later attended Trinity College, Dublin, taking a BA degree in 1826, and in 1829 was ordained a deacon. His father died in 1829, leaving him ¬£20,000 and an estate worth ¬£1,3000 a year. In Dublin he married Anne Jane Alley, and in 1831 they had a son named Robert, who would later die of consumption. In 1832, he gained his MA degree. = London and Fetcham = St Mary, Fetcham, Craig's first parish By 1834 had moved from Ireland to Cambridge in England, apparently due to abuse received due to his anti- Catholic pronouncements.. Ann died in 1834 in Hastings. In 1834, he was preaching in London, where he met and married Jane Helena Johnstone, known as Helena. She had a personal fortunate of ¬£56,000. In 1836, he was granted the living of Church of St Mary, Fetcham. = Leamington Spa = All Saints Church, Leamington Spa, constructed by Craig In 1839, he exchanged the parish with the Revd Robert Downes for that of All Saints Church, Leamington Spa. It was reported at the time by local journalist George Morley that Craig's income exceeded ¬£100,000. At that time, All Saints was a small medieval church, which had had some enlargement but was greatly inadequate to the needs of the growing population. In 1842, Craig began to plan to replace the church, to his own plan and largely from his own pocket. He had plans drawn up by local architect JG Jackson, but is said to have acted largely as his own architect. Local tradition states that he dismissed 11 architects during the church's construction, and eventually appointed himself Clerk of Works. The nave opened for worship in 1844, still incomplete and attached to the transept of the old church. The chancel was completed in 1845, and the north transept in 1849, but construction then halted. In 1847, he also commissioned local firm Mitchell of Leamington Spa to complete Holy Trinity Church, Leamington Spa, started in 1825, as a chantry chapel to All Saints. = Telescope = Craig's telescope on Wandsworth Common In 1852, Craig set about on a project to construct a huge new telescope, the Craig telescope, on Wandsworth Common. The telescope was constructed, on land donated by Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer. However, the telescope was not successful, and with Helena's death in March 1854, he returned to Leamington. = Return to Leamington Spa = In the 1850s, Craig was involved in monetary disputes, and was jailed for a short period in Warwick. In 1867 he recommenced building of the church, this time engaging architect T C Barry to design the South transept. Craig's third wife, Jane, died in 1870. In his old age he had his right foot amputated, and had to be carried to church each Sunday. = Death = He died in 1877, aged 71, and his funeral is said to have been the largest ever seen in Leamington. All Saints Church was completed after Craig's death by Sir Arthur Blomfield; Nikolaus Pevsner says the work \\"is of course far more knowledgable, but it lacks Craig's improvident zest\\".

Completed and commissioned in June 1944, she served in the late stages of World War II and took part in the Philippines campaign at the time of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. She then operated as a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier, including during the Battle of Okinawa, before she was lost in April 1945. Construction and commissioning I-56 was laid down on 29 September 1942 by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal at Yokosuka, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 629. On 12 June 1943 she was both renamed I-56, the second submarine of the name, and provisionally attached to the Kure Naval District. Launched on 30 June 1943, she was completed and commissioned on 8 June 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-56 was attached formally to the Kure Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 in the 6th Fleet for workups. With those completed, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in Submarine Squadron 1 in the 6th Fleet on 20 September 1944. In early October 1944, she began conversion to a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier, in which her deck gun was removed to make room on her afterdeck for fittings that allowed her to carry four kaitens. By this time, she also had radar and a radar detector installed. =First war patrol= On 12 October 1944, the Formosa Air Battle began, in which the aircraft carriers of United States Navy Task Force 38 launched five days of air strikes against Japanese bases on Formosa and on northern Luzon in the Philippine Islands. I-56‚Ä≤s conversion was halted that day and she began preparations to deploy for her first war patrol, operating as a conventional submarine. The commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, activated Operation Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1 for the defense of the Philippine Islands on 13 October 1944. On 15 October, I-54 was assigned along with the submarines , , , and to Submarine Group A under the direct command of the 6th Fleet. She departed Kure that day with orders to attack Task Force 38, assigned to a patrol area in the Philippine Sea southeast of Formosa. On 18 October 1944, I-56 received orders to patrol east of Leyte in the Philippines, and was expected to arrive in that area on 24 October. The Battle of Leyte began with the U.S. landings on Leyte on 20 October 1944, and the Japanese naval reaction to the landings resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23‚Äì26 October 1944. On the second day of that battle, I-56 was the Philippine Sea east of Mindanao on 24 October 1944 when she fired three torpedoes fitted with magnetic exploders at the New Guinea-bound U.S. Navy Task Group 78.1. Her crew heard three explosions, and her commanding officer believed that his submarine had sunk three transports, but apparently some of the torpedoes detonated prematurely. Actually, her torpedoes damaged the tank landing ship , which survived and later reached Guam under tow by the tank landing ship . The patrol frigate attempted a counterattack against I-56, but without success. On 25 October 1944, I-56 was in the Philippine Sea northeast of Mindanao when an escort of U.S. Navy Task Group 77.1 (call sign \\"Taffy 1\\") detected her at 22:32. The task group‚Ä≤s escort aircraft carriers began a 90-degree emergency turn to avoid the submarine. At 22:34, I-56 fired five torpedoes, and her crew heard three explosions 50 seconds later. Although some sources credit I-56 with torpedoing the escort carrier , Santee was off Samar and was not part of the task group I-56 attacked. Shortly after the carriers began their turn, two torpedo wakes straddled the escort carrier . The destroyer escort counterattacked, causing several leaks aboard I-56, which dived to . Coolbaugh claimed to have sunk a submarine at , but I-56 survived, and when she surfaced later she recovered a unexploded Mark 9 depth charge from her afterdeck. She mistakenly reported sinking an aircraft carrier. With only three torpedoes left aboard, one of them defective, I-56 was ordered back to Japan. She arrived at Kure on 4 November 1944, and was credited with sinking an aircraft carrier, a destroyer, and three transports during her patrol, although in truth her only success had been damage to one tank landing ship. =First kaiten mission= Conversion of I-56 to carry four kaitens on fittings on her afterdeck resumed upon her return to Kure. She began kaiten launch drills on 12 November 1944. In December 1944, I-56 was assigned to the Kongo (\\"Steel\\") Kaiten Group along with the submarines , , , , and for an attack scheduled for dawn on 11 January 1945 on five different U.S. anchorages in widely separated locations; the date of the attack later was postponed to 12 January 1945. At 13:00 on 22 December 1944, she got underway from the kaiten base at Otsujima bound for her target, the Allied anchorage in Seeadler Harbor at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands in the Bismarck Sea. While en route, she received a 6 January 1945 report from a Japanese reconnaissance plane reporting six cruisers and 28 transports anchored at Manus. The ammunition ship had exploded catastrophically at Manus for unknown reasons on 10 November 1944, and the Japanese propagandist Tokyo Rose had claimed in a radio broadcast that a Japanese midget submarine had sunk her. As a result, the Allies had stepped up their antisubmarine patrols around Manus, and on 10 January 1945 I-56 began to experience the increased patrolling when Allied antisubmarine forces sighted her west of Manus while was attempting to get a fix on her position and pursued her for an hour before she broke contact. On 11 January 1945, I-56 surfaced north of Seeadler Harbor at 23:00 to charge her batteries in preparation for a run in on the surface to launch her kaitens for the scheduled 12 January 1945 attack. When she was north of the harbor, her radar detector detected an approaching Allied aircraft. I-56 dived, and shortly thereafter her sonar operator heard several ships searching the area for her. Her commanding officer decided to postpone the attack, and I-56 retired to the north. After dark on 12 January 1945, I-56 surfaced north of Seeadler Harbor and began another run in on the surface. When she was still out, her radar detector detected an Allied aircraft, and five minutes later she spotted an Allied ship on her radar and her radio operator reported hearing an Allied transmission in English ordering the launch of more aircraft. I-56 flooded down to reduce her silhouette and continued her approach. An Allied antisubmarine aircraft eventually attacked her, and she submerged at 02:30 on 13 January 1945. After her sound operator heard the propeller noises of several ships ahead, she again aborted her attack and withdrew. On the evening of 13 January 1945, the 6th Fleet ordered I-56 to make one last attempt to launch her kaitens and then return to Japan. She began another approach to Manus. She was west of Manus at 03:10 on 14 January 1945 when an Allied antisubmarine aircraft attacked her, and she again aborted her kaiten attack. On 18 January 1945, she received orders to return to Japan with all four of her kaitens aboard so that the ability of kaitens to withstand lengthy sea voyages could be evaluated. On 3 February 1945 she reached Otsujima, where she dismebarked her four kaitens and their pilots. She then continued on to Kure. =Second kaiten mission= After her return to Kure, I-56 underwent a refit in which her aircraft hangar and catapult were removed from her foredeck and replaced by fittings that allowed her to carry two more kaitens, bringing her total kaiten load to six. Between 26 and 29 March 1945, U.S. forces landed in the Kerama Islands southwest of Okinawa and captured advance bases in preparation for an invasion of Okinawa itself. On 31 March 1945, I-56 was assigned to the Tatara Kaiten Unit, which also included the submarines , I-47, and I-58, each carrying six kaitens, and that day she put to sea from Otsujima with six kaitens aboard, bound for an operating area northeast of Okinawa. On 1 April 1945, the Battle of Okinawa began with U.S. landings on the island. =Loss= I-56 was lost sometime in April, and the circumstances of her loss remain unknown. Most Japanese historians credit the destroyer with sinking her on 5 April 1945, but most of their Western counterparts have concluded that Hudson sank the submarine . Some Western historians credit I-56 with sinking the U.S. submarine sometime after 8 April 1945, but Japanese sources do not confirm it. On 17 April 1945, the battleship detected a surfaced submarine on radar at a range of at 23:05, and a hunter-killer group consisting of the light aircraft carrier and several destroyers set off in pursuit of it. The destroyer established radar contact on the submarine, and the destroyer subsequently launched a depth-charge attack against it. On the morning of 18 April 1945, two aircraft from Bataan and the destroyers , , and , made a coordinated attack against the submarine, and after several hours it was sunk at . The identity of the submarine sunk on 18 April 1945 remains a mystery, but I-56 is a likely candidate. On 2 May 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-56 to be presumed lost in the Okinawa area with the loss of all 122 men aboard ‚Äî 116 crewmen and six embarked kaiten pilots. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 June 1945. Notes Sources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander. IJN Submarine I-56: Tabular Record of Movement. Retrieved on September 15, 2020.

She won the 2018 Oaks, one of the original classic greyhound competitions. Early life Ravenswood Flo was sired by Laughil Blake from the dam Ravenswood May and was born on 1 March 2016. She was bred by the Barber family and subsequently reared and schooled by Paddy and Margaret Kehoe at the Forest kennels. Racing career =Early career= Following three trial runs at Towcester Stadium in January 2018, Ravenswood Flo made her competitive racing debut at the same track in an A6 on 27 January 2018. She won the race, run over 480 metres, in 28.85 seconds. This was followed up by a second successive victory; this time in an A5 race on 9 February 2018. Having achieved two further first-place finishes at A6 and A3 grade during the middle months of the year, she sprained her hock in August 2018 and consequently did not race again until November 2018. =Bedfordshire Oaks runner-up= On her return from the 79-day break, Ravenswood Flo was entered into the Bedfordshire Oaks at Henlow Stadium. She navigated her way to the final of the competition and finished as a 14‚Äì1 runner-up to Mustang Kay Cee, losing by a neck to the dog who had also beaten her in their semi-final heat a week earlier. In the same race, she finished ahead of third-placed Bull Run Byte, who would ultimately go on to win the 2019 Oaks. Trainer Kevin Hutton stated he was pleased with Ravenswood Flo's recovery from the injury that she had sustained earlier in the year. =2018 Oaks champion= After two solo trials and having run in a further two-dog trial at Swindon Stadium, Ravenswood Flo was entered into the 2018 Oaks, also held at Swindon, in December 2018. In the first-round heat of the competition on 2 December 2018, she finished in second place to the competition-favourite, Donation, and therefore qualified for the next round. In the second-round six days later, she led and made all from race-favourite Cadburys Hero in 29.42 seconds. She secured her place in the final by finishing in second place to Chubbys Caviar in the second semi-final on 15 December 2018. After qualifying for the final of one of the original classic competitions, Hutton spoke about Flo's \\"rapid improvement\\", highlighting her rise from mid-grade level at Towcester to finishing as Bedfordshire Oaks runner-up and then in-turn qualifying for the final of a classic. Hutton also stated Flo \\"had taken well to Swindon\\", whilst also accepting that she \\"very much has to lead to win\\". The 2018 Oaks final took place on 22 December 2018, with Ravenswood Flo winning the race in a time of 28.82 seconds. She led throughout the race from trap one and crossed the line one-and-a-quarter lengths clear of the staying-on Magical Vera, also managed by the same trainer‚Äìowner combination of Hutton and Stephen Harvey. Following Flo's victory, her rise from \\"A6 company at Towcester to winning a classic, the English Oaks at Swindon\\" was highlighted. Due to her Oaks success, she was nominated for Press Association Bitch of the Year for 2018 at the Greyhound Board of Great Britain end-of-year awards ceremony, which was ultimately won by Donation. =Retirement= Following on from her Oaks triumph, Flo was considered for retirement having nursed a number of niggling injuries throughout 2018. Hutton felt that if Flo had a quiet year for most of 2019 that she could return to Swindon to defend her Oaks crown at the end of the year. She raced once in the first half of the year and then went on to win an open race at Harlow Stadium in July 2019. However, her sprained hock returned in the run up to the 2019 Oaks and she retired at the end of the year. Upon departing the kennels to live with her owner and family in December 2019, Hutton stated that Flo was \\"a real kennel favourite and has the most loving and mischievous personality\\".

The protesters were acting against the eviction of low-income farmers to redevelop the land as a resort area. It is known for being the protest that sparked the Hawaiian Renaissance.  Protest  In the 1950's Henry J. Kaiser moved to Hawaii, where he developed Hawaii Kai, a planned residential community on Oahu's southeastern coast. Hawaii Kai was next to Kalama Valley, an existing community of working- class Hawaii locals. Before Kaiser's development plan, the land was a salt- water marsh, much like Waikiki before the construction of the Ala Wai canal. The land in Kalama Valley was owned by the Bishop Trust, who leased land to farmers living in the valley. High housing costs meant that most Hawaii residents could not afford to buy a home, and many residents of the valley had previously been evicted from zones that had been designated for redevelopment. Kalama Valley was rezoned from agricultural to urban land in 1968. Bishop Trust told the residents to leave the valley before July 1970 because they had given Kaiser permission to develop the land. The Trust began demolishing buildings in early July, but some families had not yet left the valley. They refused to leave and three protesters were arrested. Rallies were organized at the Hawaii State Capitol building, but little came of them. In the meantime, protesters moved into the valley, and eventually outnumbered the original leaseholders. A resident and protester named George Santos became especially prominent during the protests because he and his hog farm had previously been evicted from Bishop Trust lands zoned for redevelopment. The City of Honolulu and the Bishop Trust had been told to investigate the Trust's relocation of tenants by lawmakers in 1959, but nothing was done. During the protests Senator Nadao Yoshinaga criticized the Bishop Trust and suggested that the State of Hawaii buy the land. On May 11, 1971, a group of 32 protesters in Kalama Valley were arrested and the remaining tenants were evicted. The Trust had trouble finding trucks willing to remove the pigs from the farms, so the tenants were given access to the valley to care for their livestock until the pigs were removed a two days later. A few days later, the protests resumed in front of the Bishop Trust offices.  Aftermath  In the decade after the Kalama Valley protests other groups were evicted from their homes around the island. During evictions in Sand Island, protesters made it clear that by conducting these evictions, the state was removing Native Hawaiians from their lands. The evictions in Kalama Valley were seen as an attack on the slow- paced, Hawaiian way of life by (mainly white) landowners. They also sparked discussion about land rights, tenant's rights, and the struggle between locals and tourists. The Kalama Valley protests are widely considered the beginning of the Hawaiian Renaissance. Haunani-Kay Trask called the protests a \\"dress rehearsal\\" for more successful protests years later, like the WaiƒÅhole/WaikƒÅne protests from 1975 to 1980, and the bombing of Kaho ªolawe.

It is the fifth and final game in the Blackwell series. Plot The story starts off with Rosa investigating a condemned building. After freeing a soul, Rosa witnesses a man named George Ostin being shot dead. George's ghost pleads for Rosa's help, knowing that she's a legitimate spirit medium, but before Rosa can take any action, George's ghost is ripped apart by an unknown force. Rosa investigates George's death and, through the trail of several other ghosts, uncovers the existence of a church- based self-help group known as the Grace Group. Every member is in danger of dying or already dead, and their ghosts are in danger of being torn apart by an unknown force instead of moving on. With the help of Madeline, the former spirit guide of the Countess, Rosa and Joey are able to protect most of the souls. Later, however, Madeline betrays everyone by revealing that she had been ripping the souls herself to absorb them and gain their life force, and that she had targeted the Grace Group because their souls were exceptionally weak. Madeline explains that she wants nothing more than to end her several centuries of thankless work as a spirit guide, and intends to return to life because she cannot pass on. She absorbs the souls of the remaining Grace Group members and possesses Rosa's body, effectively returning to life. Joey is able to extract Madeline from Rosa's body, but in doing so, Rosa's mind becomes overloaded with \\"the knowledge of the universe\\", and is driven insane the same way as her aunt and grandmother before her. Madeline reveals that she was responsible for driving the other Blackwell women insane by attempting to possess them, but failing due to her insufficient life force and the emotional weakness of the host. Madeline's occupancy then departure would cause the universe to fill the void left behind and overstimulate the mediums' senses. Rosa is placed in solitary confinement at Bellevue Mental Hospital. With the help of Joey and the ghost of her late aunt, Rosa gains temporary control over her immense knowledge, and explains that Madeline is now threatening to wipe out all life in New York in an attempt to forcibly vaporize her own soul by drawing in the power of the universe through a portal. Rosa and Joey escape the hospital, and confront Madeline. Rosa takes control of the portal and subsequently allows every departed soul currently in the world to flow through her and pass on, Madeline and her aunt included. Joey, however, is still unable to pass on. The portal closes. Rosa, losing control of her mind again, decides to pass her life force to Joey with her remaining power. Joey's body becomes corporeal as he is properly alive again, and Rosa dies. The end scene shows Joey spreading Rosa's ashes over the docks where Rosa had spread her aunt's ashes at the beginning of the series. Joey monologues about how he has tried to look for spirits to help since Rosa's death by investigating the scene of a recent highway accident following rumors of disembodied screams and cries, but finds that he is no longer able to hear and see ghosts like before. Uncertain of what to do now that he is just a regular human again, Joey merely concludes that \\"life is worth living\\", and promises to live it out fully to honor Rosa's sacrifice. Development The Blackwell Epiphany was revealed in December 2012.https://web.archive.org/web/20121230200841/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-18-wadjet- eye-games-is-working-on-a-new-blackwell-game-due-next- yearhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130109035812/http://gameplay.pl/news.asp?ID=73426 It was released on April 24, 2014.

Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho became one of the earliest examples of this genre with its endless use of brands and criticism on business and consumerism. Another recent example is Ernest Cline's Ready Player One which extensively use 80s pop culture as its themes. Other prominent examples include Warren Ellis' Planetary, a superhero comic that pays homage to genre and fiction, Seth McFarlane's Family Guy which predominantly use references for gags and satire, and Louis Bulaong's Escapist Dream, a novel that genre-busts popular geek culture and topics into one virtual reality story. Another old example was the critically acclaimed film Who Framed Roger Rabbit that pays homage to American animation, and included a scene where Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny interacted. Outside of Western media, works such as Hayate The Combat Butler and Gin Tama have also become famous examples.

Biography Vicenta Garc√≠a Miranda was born in Campanario in August 1816, the daughter of Antonio Garc√≠a Miranda, a pharmacist and lover of poetry and classical literature. Due to her father's illness, which kept him bedridden for eleven years, the family had to move to the house of a paternal uncle, which made it difficult for the future writer to study. She married medical student Antonio √Ångel de Salas in July 1833, had a son in 1841, who died at eleven months, and was widowed in 1843. These sad events set the tone for a large part of her poetry. In 1845, after reading a poem by Carolina Coronado, she felt that she could also write poetry. Reading Coronado's verses provoked a violent reaction in her that led to a personal rebirth and her poetic awakening. In her poem \\"La poetisa de aldea\\" (The Village Poetess), a reflection on one from Coronado, she claims the marginal figure of the female poet, alone and isolated in her literary work. She wrote a letter of introduction with two poems, and they began a long friendship in which Coronado was not only her friend but also her mentor. Thanks to Coronado, an ode by Garc√≠a Miranda was published in the magazine El Guadiana, dedicated to Diego Garc√≠a de Paredes, also from Extremadura. She befriended other poets, such as , Manuela Cambronero, and Rogelia Le√≥n, and participated in evenings of the Liceo de Badajoz with Mar√≠a Cabezudo and Carolina Coronado. The Liceo promoted the creation of a mixed-gender academy, and at its inauguration, a tribute was also paid to Garc√≠a Miranda and other writers. There she read her poems and wrote \\"Vamos a vindicar a Extremadura\\" (We are Going to Vindicate Extremadura) for the occasion. She was appointed as a facultative member of the group along with . Her fame grew, and she began to write for various magazines: Peri√≥dico cient√≠fico, literario e industrial, directed by , that was published four times a month; El Lirio, El despertador monta√±√©s, from 1849 to 1853, of which Calixto Fern√°ndez Camporredondo was director, and with whom Garc√≠a Miranda began a long epistolary relationship; El Celt√≠bero de Segorbe (Castell√≥n); Ellas; √ìrgano oficial del sexo femenino (Madrid), edited by Alicia P√©rez de Gascu√±a, and where her feminist poem \\"Alzad, hermosas, la abatida frente\\" appeared. She organized a literary gathering at her house from 1849 to 1875, from noon to 1:00 pm, which was attended by the intellectuals of Campanario. In 1855, she published an anthology of 75 poems, Flores del valle. Her last poems are from 1865 and 1866, and some were written at the Portuguese health resort Caldas da Rainha, where she resided on her doctor's advice. She died in Campanario in 1877. At De Caldas da Rainha, she met a doctor with whom she maintained a friendship that was reflected in her letters. In them she shares her discouragement at her physical decline and progressive blindness. But she also informs him of her poems and prose writings. She expresses why she abandoned poetry in her later years ‚Äì she initially began writing to alleviate the loneliness due to the deaths of her husband and son. Having a wide circle of literary friends, and their daily tertulia took away that need to write. Work Her only published book, Flores del valle, comprises 75 poems with different themes. One of them is women and their position of submission to men, together with the need to seek new horizons. This was related to the topic of Romanticism: the escape from reality and the search for the exotic, as well as the desire for freedom, which is shown in the poem \\"A una calandria\\". She also defended women's role as poets, as proclaimed in the poem \\"Alzad, hermosas, la abatida frente\\". Another recurring theme in her poetry is nature revaluing the wild, in which she finds the faithful reflection of her poetic self. Hermandad L√≠rica The influence of Carolina Coronado's poetry on Garc√≠a Miranda's is undeniable, with the latter considered to be one of her disciples. Together with Encarnaci√≥n Calero de los R√≠os, , and , they formed a poetic group with mutual relationships, both lyrical and epistolary, which has been called the ' (Lyrical Sisterhood). They were most active in the years from 1845 to 1955. Many of their poems are homoerotic, including several of Garc√≠a Miranda's. This was accepted at the time since it was understood as a support network between women poets. Furthermore, lesbianism was not seen as subverting the social order.

The play tells the story of the arrest, trial, conviction, and execution of Italian anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti in the famed criminal case of the 1920s. It was written by Reginald Rose, directed by Sidney Lumet, and starred Martin Balsam as Sacco and Steven Hill as Vanzetti. The production received four Primetime Emmy Awards nominations, including \\"Program of the Year\\" and for best writing and directorial achievement in a drama. Plot The play tells the story, in semi-documentary form, of the Italian-born anarchists, Sacco and Vanzetti, who were arrested, tried, and executed for the murder of a guard and the paymaster during the robbery of a shoe factory in South Braintree, Massachusetts. The first hour was aired on June 3, 1960, covering the events occurring between the arrest and conviction. The production opens with the two men in their jail cells and uses flashbacks depicting the police investigation. It then reenacts portions of the trial, focusing on abuses by the presiding judge and prosecutor, and suggests that the men were convicted because of their radical political beliefs and due to prejudice against foreigners. The second hour was aired on June 10, 1960, covering the six years following the convictions, including appeals, the confession of Celestino Medeiros that he was the actual killer, public protests, the commission established by Gov. Alvan T. Fuller to assess the fairness of the trial, and the execution in 1927. Cast The cast included over 150 performers, including the following principal roles: * Martin Balsam as Nicola Sacco * Steven Hill as Bartolomeo Vanzetti * Frank Campanella as prison guard * Dana Elcar as newspaperman * Stuart Germain as Judge Webster Thayer * Carroll O'Connor as Frederick G. Katzmann, the prosecutor * E. G. Marshall as William Thompson, attorney * Robert Emhart as Gov. Alvan T. Fuller * Ben Grauer, narrator Production The idea for the production came from Reginald Rose who wrote the teleplay. Rose had won acclaim for his award-winning teleplay, Twelve Angry Men (1954). Robert Alan Aurthur was the producer, and Sidney Lumet directed. Jan Scott was the art director. The play was produced on videotape rather than being broadcast live. Lumet struggled with Rose and Aurthur as to how to present Vanzetti's address to the judge with Rose and Aurthur advocating a more feisty approach and Lumet favoring a simpler approach. Lumet prevailed and recalled Hill's performance as \\"just brilliant, it was just underplayed and so simple and so direct.\\" Rose later wrote a stage play based on his Sacco-Vanzetti teleplay. The stage play was titled This Agony, This Triumph and staged by the USC drama department in 1970. =Emmy nominations= The production was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards, but did not win in any category. The nominations were: * Program of the Year * Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Drama * Reginald Rose, for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Drama * Sidney Lumet, for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Drama Reception In The New York Times, Jack Gould praised the acting of Balsam and Hill. However, he found the overall production to be \\"workman-like\\" and \\"disappointingly superficial.\\" In the New York Daily News, Ben Gross praised NBC and the program's sponsor for their courage in presenting the play and called it \\"a blasting indictment of Massachusetts justice\\" and \\"one of the most controversial ever seen on television.\\" Critic Charlie Wadsworth praised Rose's teleplay as \\"an outstanding piece of writing\\". He also praised the performances of Balsam and Hill as \\"magnificent\\". On the day after the first part was aired, The Boston Globe published a front-page response by its legal editor, Joseph M. Harvey. Harvey criticized the production for presenting \\"only the defense side of the case\\" and damaging public perceptions as to how justice is administered in Massachusetts. He added that, while the production may have been \\"stirring\\" and \\"absorbing\\" as a drama, \\"the script was guilty of shameless distortions and omissions.\\" In another front-page presentation following the second part, The Boston Globe's TV critic, Percy Shain gave the production four stars and wrote that it left a \\"nauseating picture\\" of Governor Alvan T. Fuller. In the Los Angeles Times, Cecil Smith called it \\"a powerful piece of work, skillfully written by Rose and ably directed by Sidney Lumet, which -- agree with its premise or not -- should stir the blood.\\" Larry Wolters of the Chicago Tribune praised Lumet's \\"matchless direction\\" and called it \\"a great TV project.\\" References Category:American television films Category:American films Category:1960 television plays Category:Sacco and Vanzetti ","title":"Sacco-Vanzetti Story"},{"id":"65327027","text":"Iba 'Yan!

It is a Category I registered building on the West Coast of New Zealand.  Background  Soon after the establishment of Hokitika, during the West Coast gold rush of the 1860s, an Anglican church was built. This wooden building was erected in 1866 on Fitzherbert Street. Subsequently, the congregation decided to erect a new church as a memorial to All Saints' members who had died during World War I. A building fund was established, and in 1919 an architect from Invercargill, Edmund Wilson (1871‚Äì1941) was engaged to draw up plans. Despite putting forward a number of plans, no church was built, and the agreement with Wilson was dissolved in 1935. The congregation then invited proposals from several architects including Cecil Wood, Roy Lovell-Smith and Richard Strachan De Renzy Harman. The congregation specified that the church be built from concrete, seat 200 people, and not cost more than ¬£4,000. A design from Harman was accepted. It is possible the congregation was inspired to specify concrete both by the relative cheapness of the material, and by the construction in 1931 of the nearby St Andrews Presbyterian Church. Earthquake safety may also have been a consideration, after the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake.  Construction  Building began in 1936 and the church was consecrated on 1 November 1936, All Saints' Day, by the Rt. Rev. Campbell West-Watson, Bishop of Christchurch. Frederick Ellis The Unemployment Board, under the United‚ÄìReform coalition Government of New Zealand, instituted a house-building subsidy scheme, to provide work to the unemployed. During 1935 the scheme was expanded from house-building to include churches, Sunday schools, public halls, libraries and other buildings for non-profit organisations. All Saints' church was one of only a handful of churches to be built using a subsidy under the scheme. The total cost was ¬£4,142, with a ten per cent government subsidy. The church has cavity walls of reinforced concrete, rimu roof timbers, joists and flooring. The Oamaru stone font was carved by Frederick Gurnsey, a frequent collaborator of Harman's. The use of unadorned concrete required Harman to adapt and simplify some forms, giving a modern appearance. Initial plans for the church show a roof of cedar shingles and a tower with a spire. However the church decided to replace the shingles with tile, which meant forgoing the spire. The church contains a stained glass window designed by Wellington artist Frederick Vincent Ellis. The window commemorates Louisa Ann Evans, who died 20 July 1918, and had been instrumental in support efforts for soldiers during the war.  Current status  The church is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I structure, with registration number 5012. The listing recognises the church's importance as a landmark in a town with few medium- or high-rise buildings. It also states > \\"All Saints' may also be favourably compared with the Arts and Crafts- > inspired work of contemporaries such as Cecil Wood. The church illustrates > Harman's understanding and skilful exploitation of the qualities inherent in > reinforced concrete and realised in solid form his belief that 'with a > material such as concrete it is neither feasible nor desirable to imitate > exactly features developed in wood or stone'.\\"  References  Category:NZHPT Category I listings in the West Coast, New Zealand Category:Hokitika Category:Anglican churches in New Zealand Category:Listed churches in New Zealand Category:1930s architecture in New Zealand Category:Concrete buildings and structures Category:World War I memorials in New Zealand Category:Churches completed in 1936 ","title":"All Saints' Church, Hokitika"},{"id":"65327065","title":"Xinmiaocun station"},{"id":"65327069","text":"Reinhard Moratz is a German science educator, academic and researcher.

His research is based on computational models that account for the varying reference frames used in giving verbal instructions about navigation. Moratz has published various research papers and is the author of Visuelle Objekterkennung als kognitive Simulation and co-editor of the conference proceedings of the Conference on Spatial Information Theory 2011 (COSIT 2011). Moratz‚Äôs work has been published in Artificial Intelligence. He is a former member of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA).  Education  Moratz completed his Bachelor and Master in Informatics from the University of Hamburg. He then received Doctoral degree in the same field from Bielefeld University.  Career  Moratz started his academic career as an Assistant Professor at University of Bremen in 2001. He worked in the industry prior to receiving his Habilitation degree in Computer Science in 2008. Moratz then moved to USA and was appointed as Associate Professor at University of Maine‚Äôs College of Engineering. He was also selected as a Director of the Human Robot Interaction Laboratory at the University. Parallel to this appointment, he became member of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA). In 2017, Moratz resigned from his positions at the University of Maine and returned to Germany where he was appointed as Ausserplanm√§ssiger Professor at the University of M√ºnster‚Äôs Institute for Geo- informatics in 2018. Research Moratz‚Äôs research is primarily focused on the spatial application of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. He uses both formal and empirical methods to work on representing and modeling spatial cognition, and studying the integration of such models in spatially aware systems. His major scientific contributions include building bridges between calculi for Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR) and human natural language; and between entities of QSR calculi and perceived objects. =Compatibility of QSR calculi and human linguistic expressions= Moratz investigated spatial communication in linguistic human-robot interaction and found that linguistic constituents can be successfully mapped onto projective relations of positional QSR calculi. He designed a new calculi with finer distinctions regarding the constraint-based spatial reasoning. His work combines qualitative spatial and linguistic knowledge and has applications in the better use of natural human instructions and spatial context information in the study of human-robot interaction. Moratz‚Äôs research also has QSR applications in ontologies. He worked on enabling spontaneous references to objects in human-robot interactions. Moratz presented an empirically based design of robotic system that applied a computational model for the identification of objects based on spatial reference systems. The efficiency evaluation by linguistic analysis pointed to a variability in speaker‚Äôs spontaneous strategies. =Relation between entities of QSR calculi and perceived objects= Moratz has also conducted research on the relation between QSR calculus entities and perceived objects. He worked on identifying the real world objects that corresponded to spatial entities related to QSR calculi. He also conducted research on methods for detecting these real world objects through an automatic perception. His approach for function-based object recognition contributed to the link between sensorically registered object features and entities to reason about, in QSR calculi. His function- based object recognition uses the sensorically accessible function that is offered by constructed objects. Moratz‚Äôs research indicates that certain spatial invariants can be used to detect meaningful high-level object classes, as object shape is typically determined by object function. Moratz applied the flexible and generalizable knowledge about time and space to his research about innovative, context aware user friendly computational systems. His research is centered on the development of a unified theory for the formal representation of spatial knowledge. Moratz‚Äôs work also has applications in the fields of mobile service robots, Geographic Information Systems, smart items, semantic technologies and location-based services, among others.

It has been registered as national heritage . In addition to the castle of Zibad, there are also the royal castle of Zibad nationally registered under the name of Shahab Castle in 2002.  Last shelter of the last Persian emperor Yazdegerd III some historian had wrote After his defeat, he sought refuge at a miller near Marv , who, however, murdered in 651. the miller had reportedly killed Yazdegerd in order to obtain his jewelry, whilst the Cambridge History of Iran states that the miller was sent by Mahoe Suri. According to the history of Belazari, Yazdegerd III was defeated in a war in province of Merv in the city of Gonabad. Nizak the army chief of Mahoe Suri in the Gonabad and according to the new research the war occurred in zibad of gonabad. Regardless, the death of Yazdegerd marked the end of the Sasanian Empire, and made it less difficult for the Arabs to conquer the rest of Iran. All of Khorasan was soon conquered by the Arabs, who would use it as a base to attack Transoxiana. The death of Yazdegerd thus marked the end of the last pre-Islamic Iranian empire after more than 400 years of rule. An empire‚Äìwhich had a generation earlier briefly conquered Egypt and Asia Minor, even reaching as a far as Constantinople, fell to a force of lightly equipped Arabs that were used to skirmishes and desert warfare. The heavy Sasanian cavalry was too sluggish and systematized to contain them; employed light-armed Arab or East Iranian mercenaries from Khorasan and Transoxiana would have been much more successful. Several different and contradictory narratives about the death of Yazdgerd III have been left in historical books. According to the excavations of Zibd-Gonabad Fortress and according to oral narrations and the report of Blazeri and Habib Abdolhai, Dr Ajam and Abas Zmani(historical study magazin 1974) it seems that the narration related to the murder of Yazdgerd in Merw Mill is more mythical than the truth and what is closer to the truth is the narration of Al- Baladhuri in Kitab Futuh al-Buldan. that Yazdgerd was killed in Gonabad .The main text of Blazeri's book The Fate of Yazdgerd III: Then he went to Khorasan, then he went to Janabad (Gonabad) he was welcomed and ruler of Merv send Nizak Trkhan to welcome him in Gonabad. but after weeks he asked the emperor to marry his daughter and the emperor refused and this caused a war and at the end Nizak attacked and defeated the king army and Destroyed and captured the remnants of the imperial forces. the battle was occurred in zibad gonabad.ŸÅÿ™Ÿàÿ≠‚ÄåÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÑÿØÿßŸÜÿåAl-Baladhuri in Kitab Futuh al-Buldan p569 ÿµÿµ €µ€∂€∏‚Äì€µ€∂€π Mahoe was probably from the House of Suren, one of the seven Parthian clans of the Sasanian state.

The building is located at 300 Homer street, at the corner of Bryant street in Palo Alto, California. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Clara County, California since 2010. The building is a good example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, and has historical relevance for the Palo Alto community, art history, and medical history.  History  = Medical clinic = In 1924, Dr. Russell Van Arsdale Lee (1895‚Äì1982) went into medical practice with Dr. Thomas Williams at an office located at Bryant Street at Hamilton Street in Palo Alto. However the medical clinic grew quickly and they decided to partner with a team of new doctors and move the clinic to a larger space. As a result, the Palo Alto Medical Clinic was founded in 1930 by Russell V. Lee, and five other doctors. The early doctors and founding partners to form the clinic included Edward \\"Fritz\\" Roth, Blake Colburn Wilbur, Herbert Niebel, Milton Saier, and Esther Bridgman Clark. In 1927, pediatrician Esther Bridgman Clark became a founding partner of the clinic, she was one of the first female doctors on the San Francisco Peninsula, and she went on to later found the Children's Health Council of Palo Alto. Palo Alto Medical Clinic was an early place for innovations in medicine, they pioneered the model of group practice, and was a predecessor to the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. = Building and architecture = The Palo Alto Medical Clinic building was designed by Esther Bridgman Clark's brother, local architect Birge Clark and the builder was Wells P. Goodenough. Clark was known for his Spanish Colonial Revival architecture style. The structure was built in 1932. The building is in a U-shape, and built of concrete, stucco and features clay roof tiles and a second floor rustic wood balcony. Below the balcony is an arched arcade which defined a loggia and a courtyard entrance. = Arnautoff murals = In 1932, Russell V. Lee commissioned artist Victor Arnautoff to paint a series of fresco paintings around the entrance of the building. Arnautoff's mural series all were medically-themed murals done in the recessed under a loggia with four panels of modern medicine and other panels showing primitive medicine, and additionally he four painted medallions of Joseph Lister, Hippocrates, Louis Pasteur, and Wilhelm R√∂ntgen are on the exterior wall of the loggia. The four murals done in color feature modern medicine and depict Luther Emmett Holt, William Osler, and Harvey Cushing. The unveiling of these murals caused a traffic jam and some controversy, in part because one of the murals showed a doctor examining a female patient whose bare breasts were at eye-level.  Modern-day  In 2000, the city of Palo Alto bought the building with the intention of restoration and eventually becoming the home of the Palo Alto History Museum and Palo Alto's historical archives.

It should not be confused with the nearby Small Sagittarius Star Cloud which lies about 10¬∞ to the north. The star cloud stretches several degrees north from the star Gamma Sagittarii, and is considered a splendid sight in binoculars - \\"a bright glow with multitudes of momentarily resolved star-sparks\\". To the naked eye the Cloud appears bright and smooth, and is said to resemble a puff of \\"steam\\" escaping from the top of the Sagittarius \\"Teapot\\" asterism.  Properties  The Large Sagittarius Star Cloud is the innermost galactic structure that can be observed in visible wavelengths, and the most distant portion of the Milky Way that can be seen with unaided eyes. Being depleted of the gas and dust from which new stars form, the region contains no young blue stars. Instead the brightest stars are K-type orange giants, which is why the Cloud has a yellowish tint on color photos. The Galactic Center, which is obscured at visible wavelengths due to interstellar dust, lies about two degrees west of the Cloud.  Features  Star cluster NGC 6520 and dark nebula Barnard 86 within the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud Superimposed upon the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud is the bright open cluster NGC 6520. Close by to the west is the small dark nebula Barnard 86, a Bok globule described by Edward Emerson Barnard as ‚Äúa drop of ink on the luminous sky‚Äù. To the east of this pair lies the globular cluster NGC 6540. The southern end of the Cloud also features a pair of globular clusters, NGC 6522 and NGC 6528, both of which lie within Baade's Window, an area especially clear of interstellar dust.

He was the older brother of the famous photographer, engineer and entrepreneur, Jos√© Ortiz Echag√ºe.  Biography  His father was a military engineer. But, rather than pursue a technical career like his brother Jos√©, he showed an early aptitude for art. His uncle, Francisco, was appointed a military attach√© in Paris, and proposed that Antonio, then fourteen, accompany him there to study. This was approved. There, he attended the Acad√©mie Julian and the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with L√©on Bonnat. Later, he went to Rome, where he shared a studio with Federico de Madrazo y Ochoa and, in 1904, obtained a scholarship to study at the .Biography @ Euskonews Altogether, he stayed in Rome for four years; spending part of his last year there in Sardinia, painting women in their native costumes. Procession in Sardinia While in Rome, he met a Dutch family who commissioned a portrait of their daughter, Elisabeth Smidt (who would later become his wife). This prompted him to move to the Netherlands and settle in Hilversum, where he painted portraits and genre scenes. In 1910, he presented his first entry at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts in Madrid and received a Second Class prize for \\"Mrs. Jansen and Her Friends\\". This success enabled him to visit the United States and Argentina and display his works at several galleries there. At the beginning of World War I, he returned to Spain. He married Elisabeth in 1919 and they spent some time in Granada, where he focused on panoramic landscapes and, once again, women in native costumes. During the 1920s, they alternated between Hilversum and Paris, where he maintained a studio. He held a solo exhibition at the Georges Petit Gallery, and the Salon presented him with a gold medal in 1923 for \\"Jacob Van Amstel at My House\\", which would also receive a First Class prize at the National Exhibition in 1924. Later, he was named a Knight in the Order of Alfonso XII, and was commissioned to paint Alfonso XIII. In 1926, he moved to Madrid and settled in Fuente del Berro; specializing in portraits of the aristocracy. He also traveled with his brother, Jos√©, seeking out landscapes and rural types as subjects for his paintings. Later, he was named President of the Asociaci√≥n de Pintores y Escultores, and the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a organized his first major solo exhibition. At the age of forty-five, he made a trip to Morocco and settled in Fez for two years; painting Berber women, the vendors at the souk, and workers from Senegal. His works were exhibited in Fez and Rabat and earned him an Order of Ouissan Alaouite Medal from the Moroccan sultan, Mohammed V. Upon returning home, he exhibited his Moroccan works in Madrid and Paris. Jacob Van Amstel at My House At the beginning of the 1930s, he moved to Argentina, where he purchased a small farm outside Santa Rosa in La Pampa. When the Spanish Civil War began, he decided to stay in Argentina; a decision that was reinforced by the start of World War II. He continued to exhibit frequently in Buenos Aires and the United States; notably at the Carnegie Institute in 1940. That same year, he was named a corresponding member of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. Two years later, he died of lung cancer, aged fifty-eight. In 1998, the \\"Museo Ortiz Echag√ºe\\" was inaugurated in Santa Rosa. Two years later, another museum dedicated to his work was opened in Atzara, Sardinia.

It premiered on Netflix on September 16, 2020. Format =Main game= A team of six contestants performs a total of five songs that share the same theme. For each song, each remaining contestant who is part of the team must sing their assigned lines, with the order of performance being assigned at random. The amount of money that is added to the jackpot (which has a maximum value of $60,000) is determined based on how well the team sings; the individual scores (which determine a contestant's vocal accuracy) are calculated during the performance. At the end of a song, the contestant with the highest individual score (out of 100 percent) advances to the next round; the other contestants are put up for elimination via a secret vote. After the contestants vote, the contestant who has the most votes is eliminated from the game and leaves with no money except if they accumulated a bonus prize; if there is a tie, the contestant with the lowest individual score is eliminated. This process continues until two contestants remain. In the first two rounds, the maximum value for each song is $10,000; the value increases to $20,000 per song in the third and fourth rounds. During the second round, a ‚ÄúTituss Prize‚Äù for best physical performance of $500 is awarded to one contestant. If the ‚ÄúTituss Prize‚Äù isn‚Äôt awarded in the second round, it continues until awarded by the host. The rules change slightly for the fourth round, where the \\"Golden Note\\" bonus feature, where each of the three remaining contestants can win a guaranteed $1,000 bonus by perfectly singing a designated note, goes into effect; no voting takes place in the fourth round, where the contestant with the lowest individual score is eliminated. The format for the main game is somewhat similar to Weakest Link. =Endgame= In the final round of the game, two contestants compete. The contestant who had the highest individual score at the end of the fourth round is given a list of two songs to choose from; the other contestant is responsible for singing the first lines. Unlike in the first four rounds, the individual scores for both contestants are not calculated during the performance, and no additional money is added to the jackpot. Once the song finishes, the individual scores are determined; the contestant with the highest individual score claims the jackpot plus any accumulated bonuses.

Victor Montgomery Keeling James (19 March 1897 ‚Äì 1984) was a Unitarian minister in Melbourne, Victoria from 1947 to 1969. He was the target of right- wing hostility in the 1950s and 1960s due to his activities in the peace movement and links to Communist China. Background The Melbourne Unitarian Church was founded in 1852 as a conventional anti-Trinitarian church with the Bible as its foundation. :Its services and sacraments were similar to those of regular Protestant churches, including Holy Communion,Halfway House to Infidelity, p.115 but substituted reason for dogma, so little credence was given to heaven, hell and reincarnation, original sin, Virgin Birth, Resurrection and Redemption. Their claim to be Christian was denied by most other church leaders. Members of the congregation were predominately of British extraction, and generally thoughtful, educated, cultured, civic-minded and prosperous. \\"Infidelity\\" here refers to anti-Christians (\\"infidels\\"), rather than adulterers. In the latter half of the 19th century they generally supported the causes of women's suffrage and Aboriginal rights, and opposed the Boer War and exploitation of Kanaka labour. William Bottomley (1882‚Äì1966) was born in WharfedaleHalfway House to Infidelity, p.39, Yorkshire, son of a Wesleyan lay preacher who died when Bottomley was 16 years old. He, also, was a preacher before becoming a Unitarian and paid propagandist for the Independent Labour Party. He came to Melbourne from Somerset in 1926 to take up an appointment as minister of the Melbourne church. He was known as a pacifist, a cause which was gaining ground following the jingoism of the First World War, in which he served. He briefly entered politics as a candidate against Harold HoltHalfway House to Infidelity, p.81 for the Federal seat of Fawkner in 1937 and opposed participation in WWII. He was a popular and energetic minister, attracting a large following to the church, including university students to its Young People's Society. He was involved with the Workers' Educational Association and the University Extension Board. He gave thoughtful and entertaining talks on ABC radio. He conducted a popular program, \\"The Unitarian Half-hour\\" weekly on radio 3XY, which ran from 1943 or earlier. He published a monthly magazine, The Beacon from the mid-40s, which would survive to 1956. He attracted guest speakers ranging from the conservative Wilfrid Kent Hughes to Maurice Blackburn. Zelman Cowan was a regular before he became a national figure and O. R. Snowball used the pulpit in his push for divorce reform. Bernard O'Dowd and Marie Pitt were active members. The vibrant intellectual atmosphere and freedom of the church also attracted a number of \\"free spirits\\" and \\"oddball\\" individualists.Halfway House to Infidelity, p.44 History Victor James was born in Pontypool, Wales, son of a dentist, druggist and Calvinist Methodist lay preacher, but strongly influenced by his neighbour, a shoemaker and student of Darwinian evolution, who encouraged him to question Biblical authority. Following demobilisation in 1918 he trained as a dentist, with a practice in Ilminster, Somerset, and by 1922 was married and living in Taunton, where he heard Bottomley preaching and so became a regular attendee and occasional lay preacher of Taunton Unitarian Chapel on Mary Street.. He began preaching at nearby Yeovil, which had lost its regular minister and was in danger of closing. He abandoned dentistry to study externally for the Unitarian ministry, a four-year course at Manchester College, Oxford; he then returned to South Wales, where he became minister of the Unitarian churches of Aberdare and Mountain Ash nearby.Halfway House to Infidelity, p.104 Bottomley came out of his service in the First World War disillusioned but not an absolute pacifist. He was not enamored with the anti-religious and undemocratic nature of Communism. He championed workers' rights but not absolutely ‚Äî he spoke against the miners' strike of 1949.Halfway House to Infidelity, p.86 James had not only served in that conflict but, due to his longstanding antipathy to Fascism, served also in WWII as instructor with rank of company commander in the Welsh Regiment,Halfway House to Infidelity, p.104 followed by an RAF regiment (5358 Airfield Company) as squadron leader in China. He then served as Provost Marshal at Kowloon, accompanied by his wife, in the years 1945‚Äì1946. He was not as religious as Bottomley, being more humanist, perhaps agnostic. =Melbourne church= James was invited by Bottomley to take the position of assistant minister of the Melbourne church. He arrived by the Orion with his wife and four children on 3 July 1947. He became publicly involved in freedom of speech and anti-war movements (see below)), generally perceived as Communist-inspired. Though he was at pains to point his participation was out of a personal conviction and not on behalf of his congregation, it drew unwelcome attention to the church, which in 1949 split along political lines. :There had also been allegations that Bottomley had been overly familiar with one female member of the congregation (though no suggestion of immorality was made) culminating in an effusive Christmas card. found by James in a wastebasket. James, who found the card in a wastebasket, was reported as suing Bottomley for libel. The only mention of this story, not repeated. A meeting of the congregation, though \\"stacked\\" with friends of Bottomley, found against him, and he resigned rather than accept their verdict. Bottomley and his followers founded the Unitarian Fellowship of Australia, which held its first meeting on 7 March 1950 at the Lecture Hall, 25 Russell Street, Melbourne, and founded the monthly magazine Quest. James conducted \\"The Unitarian Half-hour\\" from 1947 or earlier to 1964.Halfway House to Infidelity, p.46 In 1952 James invited Stephen Fritchman, pacifist and minister of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles to address the congregation on the occasion of its 100th anniversary service. He was also to have toured other States, sponsored by the Australian churches, but his application for a passport was refused by the US State Department. With the smaller congregation and departure of its more generous supporters, maintenance of the old building in Cathedral Place became insupportable, and in 1964 James's congregation built the Melbourne Unitarian Peace Memorial Church at 110 Grey Street, East Melbourne,Halfway House to Infidelity, p.46 opposite Mercy Hospital. James left the ministry in 1969 and was succeeded in 1972 by Terrence Stokes, previously known for his involvement with the Victorian Society of Organists. = Activist = Perhaps his first foray into public activism was in 1949, when he was one of 23 clergy who signed a public letter of protest against the proposal of a large section of city councillors to ban one John Rodgers, director of Australia-Soviet House, from holding a meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall, and efforts by the RSL to disrupt such events. The Democratic Rights Council was founded in Sydney, 1935, by the Labour Council, which had come under attack as a pro-communist body. James was a member when he and a handful of others, in September 1949 following a successful peace rally, founded the Australian Peace Council (APC). Charter members included Doris Blackburn MHR, Leonard Mann, Frank Dalby Davison, Eleanor Dark, William Hatfield, Canon W. G.

Teams promoted from Klasa A move up to the liga okrƒôgowa, whilst relegated teams descend to the Klasa B leagues. The exceptions are Klasa A in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, where it is the lowest tier of the game (no Klasa B), and in the Greater Poland Voivodeship, where it is the eighth tier of the football hierarchy, due to the existence of V liga in this region. History In 1920‚Äì1927, Klasa A was the highest level of regional competitions, class A champions met in the finals of the non-league Polish Championships. In 1928, the league joined the Polish Football Association and Klasa A became the second tier of the competition ‚Äì its champions were promoted as a result of multi-stage play-offs. In the 1930s, district leagues were gradually established, thus class A became the third level of the competition. It regained its importance shortly after the Second World War in 1946‚Äì1947, when the non-league Polish Championships were played again.

Since 2019, the new term NFR became popular in the risk management sector  Examples  Non- financial risks include: * Operational risk (Op risk). In case that Op risk is considered a part of NFR (and not as equivalent), Op risk summarizes e.g. those risks which can be quantified by the use of scenario models. Examples are pandemics, floods and other weather events. * Conduct risk means that the behavior of the cooperation's employees leads to losses * Cyber risk and IT risk are possible losses due to security breaches. * Compliance risks are risks related to Governance, risk management, and compliance. Managing the compliance risk means putting a price tag on potential failures of adhering to self-given rules of the bank as well as Regulatory compliance. * Regulatory risk are possible losses due to changes of the law and regulations. * Reputational Risk is potential loss caused by the damage to a firm's reputation.

History The site street lay mostly within the walls of Roman Eboracum, and two Anglo-Saxon carved stones and a large coin hoard have been discovered in excavations in the area. The are the street formed part of St Leonard's Hospital in the Mediaeval period, which from 1546 until 1698 was a royal mint, leading to the area becoming known as \\"Mint Yard\\". In 1675, Mint Yard was bought by the Corporation of York, for ¬£543. The construction of the street was proposed in 1831, with the intention that it would be built up with \\"genteel private residences\\". The street runs across the line of the York city walls, a section of which were demolished, along with the barbican of Bootham Bar. Although there were plans to entirely demolish Bootham Bar, this did not occur. The street opened in 1835, and construction of the houses was completed in 1842. The expense of constructing the street left the York Corporation in debt. This included paving the street with Macadam, and providing a new facade for the York Theatre Royal, which had previously faced Little Blake Street, but from 1835 had its main entrance on St Leonard's Place. The street became a popular area for entertainment, with the York Subscription Library opening in 1836, the Yorkshire Club operating for a time at 5 St Leonard's Place, and the De Grey Rooms, used for concerts and meetings, opening in 1842. The new York and North Midland Railway opened its head office on the street. Initial residents included the Recorder of York, C. H. Elsby; the town clerk, Robert Davies; and the architect John Harper. In 1933, the 99-year leases on many houses on the street expired, and the Corporation of York then turned the street's main terrace into council offices. It left the terrace in 2013, after which it was converted back into housing. The street forms part of York's inner ring road, and although the council have investigated pedestrianising it, this would require provision of an alternative route, including a new bridge across the River Ouse. Layout and architecture The De Grey Rooms and De Grey House The street runs north, from the junction of Blake Street, Duncombe Place and Museum Street, gently curving to Exhibition Square, where it meets High Petergate and Bootham. Much of the western side of the street is taken up by the terrace of 1-9 St Leonard's Place, designed by John Harper and completed in 1834. There is also a small garden with a stretch of the Roman city wall, before the street opens up into Exhibition Square. On the eastern side lie De Grey House, completed in 1835, and for many years from 1909 the York Conservative Club; the De Grey Rooms; and the York Theatre Royal.

Ecology The marsh features a patchwork of sedges and cattails among small stretches of open water. Strands of aspen and willow can be found along its shores. Resident mammal species include beaver, muskrat, and moose. The marsh is located at the junction of the Columbian and Thompson-Okanagan bird migration corridors, which results in a variety migratory bird species using the marsh as a flyway stopover and a breeding ground.

Ferguson had held the seat since 1830 and had received significant support from the Catholic segment of the constituency. The Liberal Party's candidate Samuel MacCurdy Greer had counted on this support transferring to him, however the Irish Conservative Party's candidate William McCormick, who employed a significant number of Catholic workers, managed to split the Catholic vote. The Liberal Party's Presbyterian support had also been adversely affected by their defeat to the Tories in Londonderry County in 1857, which led many to withdraw from politics. The election resulted in a narrow victory for McCormick, with a 19-vote majority. He held the seat until his retirement at the 1865 United Kingdom general election.  Background  Londonderry City, a one-seat borough constituency, had been represented in the House of Commons of the British Parliament by Sir Robert Ferguson, 2nd Baronet since the 1830 United Kingdom general election. Ferguson, who represented first the Whig and then the Liberal Party, died on 13 March 1860, triggering a by-election. Ferguson had been unopposed in all five elections held in the constituency since 1841.  Candidates  The Irish Conservative Party's candidate was William McCormick, a Donegal-born engineering contractor. He arrived in Londonderry in 1840 as an entrepreneur during a land reclamation project on Lough Swilly. McCormick was popular as he had intervened to save local railway lines running to Coleraine and Enniskillen and employed hundreds of local people. There were two Liberal Party candidates Samuel MacCurdy Greer and George Skipton. Greer was born in County Londonderry and represented the county constituency as a Radical between the 1857 and 1859 general elections. Skipton was a resident of Beech Hill in Londonderry. All of the candidates were prominent in the municipal life of Londonderry.  Results  The electorate comprised freemen of the city, houseowners with property rated at a value in excess of ¬£10 per year and occupiers of properties rated at ¬£8 or more per year. Ferguson had been largely apolitical and had received the support of the Catholic population. However the majority of constituents were Protestants (around 37% Presbyterians and 22% Episcopalians) and, with a weakening of Liberal support in the city following Ferguson's death, from 1860 the Conservative Party entered a period of dominance. The Presbyterians had supported Greer at the 1857 by-election for Londonderry County but the victory of Tory landlord-nominee James Johnston Clark led to the withdrawal of many Presbyterians from politics. McCormick, many of whose employees were Catholic, campaigned heavily for support from this segment of the population. This was successful in splintering the Catholic vote, which Greer had thought he could count on. Skipton had hoped to attract support from across all groups in the city, but because of strong denominational ties in the constituency only received a handful of votes. McCormick won the election, held on 2 April, with 327 votes compared to 309 for Greer and 82 for Skipton. An election petition was made against the result but the House of Commons committee declared the result as valid on 8 June 1860. McCormick chose to serve only one term, retiring on 11 July 1865 with the dissolution of parliament ahead of the 1865 United Kingdom general election.

Early life  Edward Heerema was born in 1947 to and Erna Heerema. He has four brothers and one sister. He spent his childhood in Venezuela where his father had exiled himself after WWIIhttps://www.tracesofwar.nl/articles/4112/Heerema-Pieter- Schelte.htm?c=gw and worked as an engineer in Maracaibo. He has had a close relationship to his father, with who he worked at his fathers company Heerema Marina Contractors (HMC) for eight years. During his stay at the HMC company, he was put in charge of the research and development department. After his father died in 1981, he and his brothers took care of HMC for some years, until in 1985 he decided to found Allseas.  Allseas  Allseas would become the first owner of a dynamically positioned pipe-laying ship by 1986, the Lorelay. Heerema is the sole owner of Allseas and lays importance to the independence of the companies engineering projects. The company has its own engineering department doesn't outsource its engineering projects. Heerema was responsible for several engineering breakthroughs during his career and expanded the number of ships of Allseal considerably. The project of an off shore platform decommissioning ship like Pioneering Spirit has been developed since 1987 and its building was initiated in 2011. The Pioneering Spirit finally took up work in 2016. In 2018, he unveiled plans to build even a larger ship called by now Amazing Grace which would be able to also decommission large off shore oil platforms with a tonnage of up to 72'000 metric tons. = Allseas scam trial = Edward Heerema was also targeted by the fraudster Paul Sultana, who persuaded him to agree to deliver 88 Mio.¬£ through Allseas, which would be placed in an investment which promised very high returns. Heerema initiated a private prosecution after the British state courts initially refused to condemn Paul Sultana due to lack of evidence. Paul Sultana was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment in June 2018 = Controversies = He was the target of repeated criticism for naming the largest ship in the off shore oil business in memory of his father Pieter Schelte, off shore oil industry pioneer and member of the Waffen-SS during World War II At first he defended his decision as it was his company who developed and built the ship and he seemed to be convinced his father should be remembered in this way. But as he became aware what an impact it had for the victims of nazi actions, he agreed to rename it into Pioneering Spirit.  Awards  On April 12, 2016, he was awarded a Fellow Chartership of Engineer by the Royal Netherlands Society of Engineers (KIVI). Heerema was the first and only one at the time to have received this title in the Netherlands.

Career path  Former student of the √âcole Polytechnique (class of 1965). Researcher at the √âtablissement d'√âtudes et de Recherches M√©t√©orologiques (EERM/Paris, 1970‚Äì82), at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (Boulder/USA, 1971‚Äì72), and at Oregon State University (Corvallis/USA, 1980‚Äì81). D in Physical Sciences in 1976. In 1982, he became the first director of the Centre National de Recherches M√©t√©orologiques (CNRM, Toulouse), a position he held until the end of 1994. From 1995 to 2010, Director of the European Center for Research and Advanced Training in Scientific Computing (CERFACS, Toulouse). Since then, he has been retired as General Engineer of Water and Forestry. He was a lecturer in mechanics at the √âcole Polytechnique (part-time, 1976‚Äì90), and Professor of Physics at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de l'A√©ronautique et de l'Espace (part-time, 1988‚Äì92). Elected to the French Academy of sciences, correspondent of the Universe Sciences section, in 1990, he is also a founding member of the French Academy of Technologies (2000).  Scientific work  Jean-Claude Andr√©'s scientific work concerns four main subjects. During the first half of the 1970s, he first worked on the irreversibility of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and proposed the first theoretical formulation of the shape of the turbulent damping coefficient, using an original method, which was independently taken up and formalized under the name of \\"renormalization theory\\". He applied this consideration of irreversibility in the formulation of so-called Eddy-Damped Quasi-Normal (EDQNM) approximation with the Nice school (U. Frisch and collaborators)\\". He then used the EDQNM approximation to realistically simulate homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in 2 and then 3 dimensionsA. Pouquet,, M. Lesieur, J.C. Andr√© et C.

He then, during the second half of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, developed, on the basis of ideas deduced qualitatively from his previous work in turbulence theory, a method of \\"one-point\\" closure at the third order of the turbulence equations, called the \\"clipping\\" approximation. Thanks to this approximation, he and his research team at the EERM carried out some \\"firsts\\": first simulation with a one-point closure method of penetrating convection; then subsequent applications to numerous atmospheric boundary layer situations,J.C.

These results have been widely cited in the international literature. These third-order simulations have also been used as a \\"numerical laboratory\\" to develop and calibrate simpler methods, known as \\"parameterizations\\", for example in the case of top boundary layer entrainment or night boundary layer development.J.C.

He thus proposed an original method using medium-scale atmospheric modeling as an integrating tool to estimate the fluxes (of heat, water vapor) at the soil- vegetation-atmosphere interface at the scale of the grid cell of a climate model. In support of this numerical modeling work, he designed, organized and carried out, in the South-West of France, a large-scale international experimental campaign (F, GB, USA...), based on this concept: HAPEX-MOBLHY 86,J.C.

The time was the middle of the 17th century when Pac and Danielewicz families stood strong behind the King and did not support the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. After those wars, on behalf of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, John II Casimir Vasa, the Pac family could rule Grand Duchy of Lithuania together with their closest allies like Danielewicz.In the Shadows of Poland and Russia - The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Sweden in the European Crisis of the mid-17th Century, Andrej Kotjarchuk S√∂dert√∂rns h√∂gskola, Doctoral. pp. 121, 271‚Äì272, In 1653 the property of Bohdanow named after Prince Bohdan SapiehaC.

Barbara's daughter Tekla Wollowicz then married Piotr Micha≈Ç Pac and the property passed to the Pac family. Since Piotr Micha≈Ç Pac had no children of his own, he adopted Micha≈Ç Danielewicz,(Starosta of Plotelsk, Inspector of the Hungarian border) into the Pac family as he was the son of his sister Katarzyna Pac. As result of that, large property of Bohdanow, the town of Kartena and other properties was passed from the Pac family to Danielewicz. Ostoja Danielewicz family owned several big properties in Lithuania, Prussia, Belarus and Volyn, Ukraine and held high ranking offices in the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, mostly in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Through the centuries Danielewicz was highly respected for and their knowledge in jurisdiction Wojciech Wijuk Kojalowicz, Herbarz, Krakow 1897, pp. 204‚Äì208 and therefore was often granted the position of Starosta (Lord of Regality) or County Judge as they also many times represented their districts and provinces at the Sejm, the Parliament of the Commonwealth.

Since the Pac family become extinct, descendants of the line of the Micha≈Ç Danielewicz are the only ones to continue the heritage of the Pac due to adoption of him and his descendants. During the Partitions of Poland or Partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth 1772‚Äì1918, Danielewicz's of Ostoja participated in many upraising actions witch cause Russian side to confiscate most of the family properties. As the family did not support foreign forces in the Commonwealth and was in opposition, no offices were given to the family anymore.

She took the Diplomate in Public Health in 1921, and married Hubert John Fry (a pathologist) in Paddington in the same year.  Marriage and dismissal  In 1921, following her marriage to Dr John Fry, Miall-Smith received a letter anticipating her resignation as the Assistant Medical Officer for Maternity and Child Welfare with St. Pancras Borough Council. Miall-Smith refused to tender her resignation, citing the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 and its stipulation that 'a person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function... or from entering or assuming or carrying on any civil profession or vocation.' Louise A. Jackson has noted that although strong support from all women within the profession might have been expected, the reality was more complicated: > Married medical women found themselves pitted against their single, often > younger, peers, many of whom felt that their married colleagues, who 'had > [their] living assured by [their] husbands' earnings', had 'no right to take > posts which might otherwise fall to the lot of younger women who have to > earn their own living'. Miall-Smith did, however, receive support in the form of letters from (among others) the Women's Co-operative Guild, The Women's Local Government Society, the Council of the British Medical Association, the Society of Medical Officers of Health, the Federation of Medical Women, the National Association of Local Government Officers, and the London Society for Women's Service Nevertheless, the decision was upheld. On 20 October 1921, The Times reported that the 'St. Pancras Borough Council last night decided, by 45 votes to three, to adhere to their decision dismissing Dr. Gladys Miall-Smith from her appointment as assistant medical officer for maternity.' The Medical Woman's Journal wrote: > It appears that the council's decision is mainly based on the theory that, > because there is widespread unemployment, married women whose husbands are > able to support them should not compete in the labor market. This argument > is ancient and musty and in respects an economic fallacy. The belief is that > people with private means ought not to work because they \\"take the bread out > of the mouth\\" of those who are compelled to work for a living... It is > instructive to note that five women councillors attended the meeting, but > only two voted in favour of the woman doctor. The Women's Freedom League organised a protest meeting against the dismissal, held at the Working Men's College, with speakers including Louise McIlroy, Winifred Cullis, Helena Normanton, Agnes Dawson, and Leslie Burgin. The following year, St. Pancras appointed Dr. Stella Churchill to replace Miall- Smith. Helena Normanton, writing to The Woman's Leader, criticised this decision, noting that in hiring a widow 'St. Pancras has now obtained precisely what it wanted all along - a woman celibate.' Normanton believed that 'as long as Dr. Miall-Smith's shameful dismissal stands unredressed and unvindicated, so long do all women stand rebuked and humiliated; and the marriage state dishonoured.' Influenced in part by Miall-Smith's case, as well as other examples of married women's dismissals, the Medical Women's Federation established the Standing Committee for the Defence of Married Medical Women. They requested an amendment to the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, but were working against prevailing societal attitudes towards working married women. The situation continued for many years following Miall- Smith's dismissal.  Welwyn Garden City  In 1922, Dr. Gladys Miall-Smith and her husband Dr. Hubert John Fry went to the growing town of Welwyn Garden City (founded 1920), becoming the town's first doctors, working mostly alongside volunteers. In Welwyn Garden City, Miall-Smith became 'a much respected GP with a special interest in women & children.' In the year of their arrival, Miall-Smith and Fry formed the town's Health Council (with Dr. C. H. Furnival), creating provision for first aid and infant care. She established its first infant welfare clinic, where she was medical officer, and the couple instituted an insurance scheme for patients in 1924 to support their medical care. Alongside others, including the wife of Richard Reiss, Miall-Smith 'worked tirelessly to improve health standards in the town,' before the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948, and afterwards. Miall-Smith was widowed in 1930, when Hubert Fry died from blood poisoning after scratching himself while carrying out a postmortem examination. They had three children.  Retirement and death  Following her retirement, Miall-Smith travelled widely, rendering service in maternity hospitals in Ghana and Zimbabwe. Gladys Miall-Smith died 3 January 1991 in Northampton. She was 102.

Early life  Claudia Patricia G√≥mez Gonz√°lez was born 9 February 1998 in the village of La Uni√≥n Los Mendoza in the municipality of San Juan Ostuncalco, a rural area near Quetzaltenango, Guatemala to Gilberto G√≥mez Vicente and Lidia Gonz√°lez Vasquez. She was an indigenous Mayan Mam and the eldest of three sisters. She was the first member of her family to graduate from high school, where she earned a certificate in accounting in 2016. Her father worked for several years in Atlanta but was deported in 2017.  Emigration decision  G√≥mez Gonz√°lez didn't pass the entrance exam for Universidad de San Carlos, Guatemala's only public university, and her parents couldn't afford to send her to a private university. She had been unable to find work. The family had difficulty paying for the younger children's schooling. According to Marie- Claire, \\"she saw migrating to the United States as her only hope.\\" An aunt living in Atlanta offered to loan her the $11,000 she needed to get to the US.  Death  Planning to stay with her aunt in Atlanta and find work cleaning houses, she left Guatemala 7 May 2018, accompanied by a paid guide, and on 22 May arrived in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, where she was taken to a safe house with other Guatemalans planning to cross the border, and phoned home. Late in the morning of 23 May she and five young men crossed the Rio Grande and, as instructed by their guide, went into an abandoned building near Centeno Lane in Rio Bravo, about a mile over the border, to wait for the next guide. They saw a Border Guard officer and ran away, hiding in some bushes. Two of the men ran away. Two others ran into an abandoned trailer, leaving G√≥mez Gonz√°lez and one man behind. A witness reported G√≥mez Gonz√°lez took a step, and the agent took aim and fired, shooting her in the head, then running into the trailer. The two men in the trailer told reporters they heard the shot, and an officer holding a gun came into the trailer, pointing the gun at them and telling them to leave the trailer. The men left the trailer and were handcuffed, and they saw paramedics working over G√≥mez Gonz√°lez.  Aftermath  The Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) first reported that G√≥mez Gonz√°lez, who was described as petite and timid, and the rest of the group had attacked the officer with blunt objects and resisted arrest, and that he had shot in self-defense. Marta Martinez, a woman who lived nearby, heard the shot and ran outside. She streamed the aftermath of the incident, in which she can repeatedly be heard asking why the agent had killed G√≥mez Gonz√°lez. The video went viral, and the CBP account changed to the group had \\"allegedly assaulted\\" and \\"rushed the agent\\". Three of the men accompanying G√≥mez Gonz√°lez were arrested and detained to testify; according to The Guardian, after five months, \\"tired of incarceration, they opted to be deported home and return to testify in the US, if a criminal charge is brought against the agent.\\" Information released about the agent involved in the shooting included that he had been a CBP agent for fifteen years and that he had been placed on administrative leave. As of May 2019, an FBI investigation was ongoing. G√≥mez Gonz√°lez's family said they had not been contacted. In May 2019, the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas filed a claim for US$100 million in damages on behalf of G√≥mez Gonz√°lez's parents under the Federal Tort Claims Act. In May 2020 they filed a lawsuit in Laredo against the US and multiple CBP agents believed to have been at the scene. One agent was mentioned by name as the agent the ACLU believed was the agent involved, saying that if it hadn't been that agent, it was one of the other agents at the scene.

Tibetan Buddhism inherited numerous tantras and forms of tantric practice from medieval Indian Buddhist Tantra. There were various ways of categorizing these tantras in India. In Tibet, the Sarma (New Translation) schools categorize tantric scriptures into four classes, while the Nyingma (Ancients) school use six classes of tantra.  Sarma (\\"New Translation\\") classification  The Sarma, \\"New Translation\\" schools of Tibetan Buddhism (Gelug, Sakya, Kagyu, Jonang) classify tantric practices and texts into four. In this, they follow Indian Tantric Buddhists such as AbhayƒÅkara, who makes this distinction in his Clusters of Quintessential Instructions. Tantras are classified according to the capacity of persons, the deities they use, the specific types of methods they employ and how they use desire (kama).Tsong-kha-pa, The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra, Part One in Tsong-kha-pa et al.

There are also various prescriptions dealing with eating, drinking, and clothing.Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. 41. According to Kongtrul, in KriyƒÅ Yoga, one relates to the deity as a subject relates to their lord and only meditates on an external deity (not on oneself as being the deity).Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), pp. 59, 96. According to Kongtrul, \\"the essence of action tantra\\" is: > to view the profound truth with fear and apprehension due to an inferior > intellect and to observe utmost cleanliness and purity, ablution, > asceticism, and so forth; to not develop the pride of being the deity since > there is no generation of oneself as the pledge deity; to be without the > supreme bliss of the pristine awareness deity since the pristine awareness > deity has not been invoked to merge into the pledge deity; not to be a > receptacle for the sublime teachings since one is unqualified to receive > teachings on what is sublime and extraordinary, the deep meanings that were > spoken with specific intention; and due to the shortcoming of being unable > to fathom the sublime, being conditioned by concepts about the purity or > impurity of things, to train thoroughly in rituals of ablution, and so > forth, and thereby to practice deity yoga in a subject-to-lord relationship > with the deity.Jamgon Kongtrul (2005), pp. 100 - 101. Regarding initiation, The Essence of Pristine Awareness states: \\"it is widely known that in action tantra there are the water and crown initiations.\\"Jamgon Kongtrul (2005), p. 102. Each action tantra text generally centers on a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva, and many are based on dharanis. Some of these texts are actually titled \\"sutra\\" or \\"dharani\\". Action tantra includes various practices for deities such as Medicine Buddha, \\"the eleven faced\\" Chenrezig and Vajrapani.

Regarding the practice of deity yoga in Action Tantra, Kongtrul outlines six main elements or \\"deities\\" \\"Emptiness, letter, sound, form, Seal, and sign\\": > First, the deity as emptiness is to remain absorbed in emptiness, the > essence of ultimate awakening mind, in which the essential principle of > oneself and that of the deity are of an inseparability beyond concepts. > Second, the deity as letter is to meditate on the particular deity [one is > practicing] in the form of the written letters of the [deity‚Äôs] mantra > resting on a moon disk (representing one‚Äôs mind) visualized in space [in > front]. Also considered to be the letter deity is to meditate simply on the > moon [omitting the letters]. Third, the deity as sound is to meditate on the > resonant sounds of the mantra (on the moon) associated with one of the > [three] deities of the three families to which the recitation practice for > complete familiarization is directed. Fourth, the deity as form is to > meditate on the complete form of the deity. [The first step involves] > meditating that light radiating from the letters of the mantra fulfills two > aims; then, [as the light reconverges, the letters] transform into the > deity‚Äôs complete form. Fifth, the deity as seal is to perform the hand > mudras for blessing, such as the mudra of the crown protrusion, and while > reciting the appropriate mantra, to touch the corresponding places of the > body with the mudra. Alternatively, one makes the pledge mudra of that > particular [family]. Sixth, the deity as sign is to recall, in all > circumstances, the form of the deity as meditated in the state of equipoise > so that the appearances of the outer world and its inhabitants are regarded > as pure visions, imagined as the deity‚Äôs residence, form, and > resources.Jamgon Kongtrul (2005), p. 107. = CaryƒÅ = Panel from a Tibetan Buddhist Ritual Crown Depicting Buddha Vairocana, late 13th‚Äìearly 14th century. CaryƒÅ (spyod pa, Performance, or Conduct) tantras are meant for practitioners of middle ability. According to Tsongkhapa, it is for \\"those who balance external activities and internal meditative stabilization without relying on very many activities.\\" The kind of desire it uses is the weakest kind, comparable to a couple looking at each other. They are also known as Upa tantra, or Ubhaya tantra. Although these tantras maintain numerous external ritual actions, the emphasis is now upon obtaining liberation through meditation. It is thus seen as maintaining a balance between inner and outer actions. It is externally similar to KriyƒÅ tantra, and internally similar to Yoga tantra. According to Kongtrul, the main elements of Conduct tantra are: > to practice and train thoroughly in a vast range of deeds related to > activations, which are sets of outer (physical and verbal) [actions] such as > mudras and other characteristic focuses as taught in action tantra, and thus > [to have] objects of practice that accord with that tantra; to cultivate > inner (mental) contemplation that accords with yogatantra and to practice > [deity yoga] in what is like a friend-to-friend relation-ship with the > deity.Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. 116. Kongtrul further states, \\"conduct tantra is known to have five initiations: water, diadem, vajra, bell, and name.\\"Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. 117. In this class of tantras, Vairochana is a principal deity. In Tibetan Buddhism, this tantra class includes practice lineages for the Mah√£vairocan√£bhisa·πÉbodhitantra ('Awakening of Great Vairocana'), for the Vajrap√£·πáyabhi·π£ekamah√£tantra (VajrapƒÅ·πái Initiation Tantra) and for Manjushri.Ringu Tulku (2007) The Ri-Me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet, pp. 94-95, Shambhala Publications.The 14th Dalai Lama, The Heart of Mantra, in Tsong-kha-pa et al. (2017) The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra Volume Two. The presence of Buddha Vairocana is often evident in tantras of this class where he is often depicted in the centre of a mandala with four other Buddhas of his retinue placed to the four quarters, the cardinal directions. Importantly, during the CaryƒÅ tantra class and literary period, there developed the salient innovation wherein the sadhaka is to cultivate identification with the deity in meditative absorption (known as \\"self generation\\"). This class of literature was also important to K≈´kai (774‚Äì835) and the development of Japanese Shingon Buddhism. Guarisco & McLeod explain Jamgon Kongtrul's codification of this class as follows: > \\"Conduct tantra, where conduct encompasses both outer ritual activity and > inner contemplation, involves training in a vast range of deeds while > entering the inner reality that presents itself in visual and audible divine > representations. The notion here is that of being close to the state of a > perfect divine being, a state not yet fully realized. This limited view is > overcome by visualizing oneself as the deity, understanding that form to be > the appearance aspect of emptiness.\\"Guarisco, Elio (trans.); McLeod, Ingrid > (trans., editor); Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Taye, Kon-Sprul Blo-Gros-Mtha-Yas > (compiler) (2005). The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Six, Part Four: Systems > of Buddhist Tantra. Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. , p.41 In CaryƒÅ yoga, the yogi visualizes themselves as the 'commitment being' (Sanskrit: samayasattva) and visualizes the 'gnosis being' (j√±ƒÅnasattva), who is envisioned in the relationship of a spiritual friend, in front of them. Various \\"meditations with signs\\" are part of this practice including: bija (seed syllable) and mandala visualization, mudra (hand seals), repetition of mantras, etc. as found in Action tantra. Conduct yoga also includes a special \\"yoga without signs\\", described by Kongtrul as follows: > The special yoga without signs is cultivated in conjunction with three > minds: the minds of entering, abiding, and emerging, the essence of which is > the ultimate awakening mind itself. The mind of entering is the realization > of the unborn nature of all phenomena (the aggregates, etc.) gained by > examining them in terms of the four extremes; the mind of abiding, the > direct realization of the unborn nature as the essence of the nonconceptual > state; and the mind of emerging, the ensuing great compassion directed to- > ward suffering beings who lack such realization.Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. > 121. = Yoga = Yoga tantra (rnal‚Äôbyor) is, according to Tsongkhapa, meant for practitioners of high ability who \\"mainly rely on meditative stabilization and rely on only few external activities.\\" The level of desire they use is said to be similar to a couple holding hands or embracing. \\"Yoga\\" refers to the union or yoking of method and wisdom. One sees one's body, speech and mind as inseparably united with those of the deity.Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. 41. Kongtrul defines Yoga tantra thus: > \\"Yoga tantra is so named because it emphasizes the inner yoga meditation of > method and wisdom; or alternatively, because based on knowledge and > understanding of all aspects of the profound ultimate truth and the vast > relative truth, it emphasizes contemplation that inseparably unites these > two truths.\\"Guarisco, Elio (trans.); McLeod, Ingrid (trans., editor); Jamgon > Kongtrul Lodro Taye, Kon-Sprul Blo-Gros-Mtha-Yas (compiler) (2005). The > Treasury of Knowledge: Book Six, Part Four: Systems of Buddhist Tantra. > Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. , p.128 Yoga tantra is the last and highest of the outer tantras, and here external rites are seen as much less important than internal practices. The empowerments given are the empowerment of the 5 Buddha families, and the empowerment of the Vajra master, and disciples must take on the commitments of the 5 buddha families, and take the tantric vows.Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), pp. 129-130. The path is split into 4 seals; the great seal of body, the seal of the speech of Dharma, the seal of the mind of commitment, and the seal of enlightened actions. Some Vajrasattva practices fall under this category, as well as the Tattvasa·πÉgraha Tantra (Summation of Essential Principles) and the Vajra≈õekhara Tantra (Indestructible Peak).The 14th Dalai Lama, The Features of Yoga Tantra, in Tsong-kha-pa et al. (2017) The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra, Part Three.Paul Williams, Anthony Tribe, Alexander Wynne.

While Vairochana maintains his position as principal deity, he is now envisaged as being in the center of 5 buddha families instead of 3, each family belonging to one of the Five Tathagathas. The Shurangama Sutra and the Shurangama Mantra from which it (called the Shitatapatra Ushnisha Dharani) comes can be included in this category. = Unsurpassable Yoga = A Hevajra Mandala Deities of the Chakrasamvara Tantra Anuttarayoga tantras (rnal ‚Äôbyor bla med, Unexcelled or Unsurpassable yoga tantras), also known as Yoganiruttaratantra are meant for practitioners of the highest ability who do not rely on external activities. It uses the highest level of desire, sexual union and is thus also designated the ‚Äútantra of union of the two.‚Äù According to Kongtrul, only Highest Yoga includes both the generation and completion phases.Tsong-kha-pa, The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra, Part One in Tsong- kha-pa et al. (2016), pp. 63 - 155.Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), pp. 40, 93. Kongtrul states that these are \\"supreme among all tantras\\" and \\"there is no other tantra above it.\\"Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. 141. The practice of Anuttarayoga is characterized by the practice Deity Yoga and also through various subtle body yogas (such as the six Dharmas of Naropa), to generate great bliss and attain the subtle clear light (luminous) mind. According to Miranda Shaw, Anuttarayoga Tantra texts \\"have remained at the forefront of contemplation, ritual, and interpretation throughout the Himalayan Buddhist sphere\\". In the classification of the Dzogchen system, used by the Nyingma, it is considered equivalent to the Mahayoga tantras.Dudjom Rinpoche, The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History, Wisdom Publications, 2002. . page 283 The Dalai Lama XIV states: \\"old translation Dzogchen and new translation anuttarayoga tantra offer equivalent paths that can bring the practitioner to the same resultant state of Buddhahood\\". Kongtrul describes the essence of Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra as being > \\"In the midst of an entourage of queens, in the form of an all-powerful > sovereign such as Heruka (in mother tantra) or Vairochana (in father > tantra); and by means of the contemplation of the great bliss of the male > and female deities‚Äô union, to be the ‚Äúking who resides in the castle‚Äù (as is > said in the tantras), which means to dwell perfectly in the queen‚Äôs bhaga, > that is, in the divine palace in the source of phenomena; to train according > to the sublime vajra words, the statements of six parameters‚Äîinterpretable, > non-interpretable, provisional, definitive, standard, and coined > terminology‚Äîwhich are contrary to worldly human customs (as is said in the > tantras, ‚ÄúSuccess is rapidly achieved by relying on one‚Äôs mother, sister, or > daughter‚Äù) by performing extremely base acts; and thereby to effect ordinary > and supreme powers.\\"Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. 142. This statement contains various tantric terms express the nature of Unsurpassed Tantra. Bhaga (ultimately) refers to the source of phenomena (chos ‚Äôbyung, dharmodaya), or source of all awakened qualities, and also literally to the vagina of one's sex yoga consort (i.e. the queen, btsun mo).Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. 417. Thus this statement refers to karmamudra, sexual union, which is a key element of the symbolism, thought and practice of Unsurpassed Yoga Tantras and which generates a great blissful consciousness (the \\"castle of great bliss\\") that is then directed to understanding ultimate reality. Furthermore, when the tantras speak of relying on one's mothers, sisters etc., this refers to different types of tantric consorts. Regarding the six parameters, this refers to \\"six levels of meaning in the content of the tantras\\" which express different ways of interpreting and understanding the tantras.  Tantras  Anuttarayoga tantras which became prominent in Tibet include: * Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra * Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´nƒÅmasa·πÉgƒ´ti (Reciting the names of Manjushri) * Sampu·π≠odbhava·∏• (Emergence from Samputa) * Ca·πá·∏çamahƒÅ¬≠ro·π£a·πáa Tantra * GuhyasamƒÅja (Esoteric Community) * VajramahƒÅbhairava Tantra (Great Vajra Terrifier Tantra) *Hevajra Tantra * K·πõ·π£nayamƒÅri Tantra (Black Yamari) * RaktayamƒÅri Tantra (Red Yamari) * MahƒÅ¬≠mƒÅyƒÅ Tantra * MahƒÅkƒÅla Tantra *KƒÅlacakra Tantra * Ekaja·π≠a Tantra In Sarma, they are sometimes further classified into \\"Father Tantras\\" (Wyl. pha rgyud), \\"Mother Tantras\\" (ma rgyud) and \\"Non-Dual Tantras\\" (gnyis med kyi rgyud). The mahƒÅyoga-tantras of Pala Empire India became known in Tibet as 'Father Tantras' (pha rgyud). According to the Gelug view, following Tsongkhapa's reasoning, Father Tantras emphasize the creation of a Buddha form through the cultivation of an illusory body, on the basis of practices with the energy system of the subtle body. Earlier Sakya masters and Kagyu scholars had viewed Father Tantras as emphasising the practice of blissful awareness. Father Tantras have also been seen as emphasizing the use of anger (pratigha) as the path of practice, focusing on the emptiness aspect of Buddha nature. The yoginƒ´-tantras which became known in Tibet as 'Mother Tantras' (ma rgyud) emphasize the development of enlightened awareness (the \\"mind\\" of the illusory body) through the cultivation of the fundamental pure mind of all beings, known as 'brilliance' (prabhƒÅsvara) (frequently translated, following the Tibetan, as 'clear light'). They are considered to emphasize the utilization of desire (t·πõ·π£·πáƒÅ) as the path of practice, focusing on the brilliant (prabhƒÅsvara) aspect of Buddha nature. Among the Mother Tantras, the most prominent is the Cakrasa·πÉvara.Essence of Vajrayana: The Highest Yoga Tantra Practice of Heruka Body Mandala, Tharpa Publications (1997) The practice of Vajrayogini evolved out of the Cakrasa·πÉvara and is now a de facto practice in its own right.Guide to Dakini Land: The Highest Yoga Tantra Practice of Buddha Vajrayogini, page 3, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1996) Other Mother Tantras are Hevajra Tantra and Ca·πá·∏çamahƒÅro·π£a·πáa. Non-dual tantras utilize both anger and desire as an antidote to delusion (avidyƒÅ), focusing on both the physical and mental, void and brilliant, aspects of enlightened mind. The example typically advanced for this category is the KƒÅlacakra Tantra. The Sakya tradition also considers Hevajra to be a non-dual tantra but other traditions classify it as a yoginƒ´-tantra.  Nyingma classification  The Nyingma school meanwhile, has six main tantra categories, which make up the last six of the Nyingma \\"nine yana\\" schema. The first three categories are essentially the same as the Sarma classification (KriyƒÅ, CaryƒÅ or Ubhaya and Yoga) and are called \\"Outer Tantras\\".Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), pp. 307-308. The last three are the \\"Inner Tantras\\": MahƒÅyoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga. * MahƒÅyoga (rnal ‚Äôbyor chen po), is a class of tantric texts and practices that emphasize the stage of generation and are sometimes also termed father tantras. The Net of Magical Manifestation (MƒÅyƒÅjƒÅla) collection contains the major Mahayoga works, The Guhyagarbha Tantra is the most influential of these. * Anuyoga (rjes su rnal ‚Äôbyor) texts are associated with tantras that emphasize the stage of completion and are associated with mother tantras. They also teach a \\"principle of instantaneous perfection\\", which is not found in other tantras. An example of one of these texts is the All-Unifying Pure Presence (Kun ‚Äôdus rig pa‚Äôi mdo). * Atiyoga (Dzogchen). In Nyingma, Dzogchen (\\"Great Perfection\\") is seen as a non-gradual method which transcends the two stages of tantric yoga and focuses on direct access to the innate purity of things. Atiyoga is further divided into three main categories: Mind Series (semde), Space Series (longde) and Instruction Series (menngakde). There are numerous tantras and texts associated with this vehicle, such as the Kunjed Gyalpo and the \\"Seventeen tantras of the esoteric instruction cycle\\" (man ngag sde'i rgyud bcu bdun). According to Longchenpa's Great Chariot: > MahƒÅyoga, the father tantra, the nature of method [related to] appearance, > [is taught] to benefit those whose strongest emotional affliction is > aversion and who are subject to excessive discursiveness. Anuyoga, the > mother tantra, the wisdom of the completion phase [related to] the essential > reality of emptiness, [is taught] to benefit those whose strongest emotional > affliction is desire and who delight in stillness of mind. Atiyoga, the > nature of nonduality, [is taught] to benefit those whose strongest emotional > affliction is delusion and who are tarnished by [attachment to] > effort.Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl (2005), p. 308. Longchenpa‚Äôs Finding Comfort and Ease in the Nature of Mind states: > Mahayoga emphasizes winds and the methods of the generation phase. Anuyoga > emphasizes the constituent [of bliss] and the wisdom of the completion > phase; Atiyoga emphasizes pristine awareness from which nothing is separate.

They were designed to fulfill a variety of roles, including fleet scouts, colonial cruisers, and commerce raiders. Arguments over the purpose of the French fleet during this period played a major role in the design of these ships; proponents of the doctrine favored large cruisers capable of attacking enemy merchant shipping while traditionalist officers preferred vessels more suited to fleet operations. A third group sought more cruisers to expand and defend the French colonial empire. The period was also marked by strategic confusion in the French naval command, as the country reoriented from its traditional rivalry with Great Britain to the perceived threat posed by the Italo-German alliance. The first French protected cruiser, , was designed in the early 1880s in response to the introduction of similar vessels in the British Royal Navy; two more vessels of similar but larger designs‚Äî and followed shortly thereafter. By 1886, the pro- Admiral Th√©ophile Aube became the French Minister of Marine and initiated a large construction program that included the cruisers , , and the , , and es, all of which had three members. The early 1890s saw the construction of the and es, derivatives of the Davout design, and the , which were improvements on the Troude and Forbin types. The colonial cruisers of the and es were also built during this period. Beginning in the mid-1890s, a series of large cruisers were ordered; the first of these, , carried the largest guns of any French cruiser, and was intended to serve as a flagship of the squadron stationed in French Indochina, while three more vessels, , , and , were designed to serve as long-range commerce destroyers. Two final colonial cruisers of the were also built during this period. Most of the vessels had relatively uneventful careers, serving in a variety of locations with the main fleets, in the French colonies in Asia, and on patrol in the Atlantic. Two were lost in accidents, and , in 1907 and 1910, respectively. Many of the ships had either been broken up or reduced to secondary roles by the start of World War I in August 1914, but several saw action, including Jurien de la Gravi√®re at the Battle of Antivari and a number of vessels along the coast of Ottoman Syria. One vessel, Ch√¢teaurenault, was lost during the war to a German U-boat attack in 1917. Most of the surviving protected cruisers were discarded in the post-war reduction of the French Navy, though a few lingered on in service as hulks into the 1920s or later. D'Entrecasteaux remained in service the longest, being loaned to the Belgian Navy in the mid-1920s and then sold to the Polish Navy in 1927; she was ultimately seized by German forces during the Invasion of Poland in 1939 and scrapped in 1942. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armament  The number and type of the primary armament - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armor  The thickness of the deck armor - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel began to be assembled } __TOC__ Sfax Sfax early in her career The French Navy embarked on a construction program in 1878 that included a series of new cruisers. The (Council of Works) intended for the vessels to be used as commerce raiders to attack British merchant shipping. The first four vessels were traditional unprotected cruisers, but the naval engineer Louis-√âmile Bertin successfully lobbied for the fifth vessel, which was to become Sfax, to be cancelled and redesigned to incorporate an armor deck to match the latest British protected cruisers. Sfax proved to be a successful design and created the basis from which the first generation of French protected cruisers would be built. Sfax had a relatively uneventful career. She spent most of her career alternating between the Mediterranean, Northern, and Reserve Squadrons. During this period, she was primarily occupied with conducting training exercises with the rest of the French fleet. While in the Reserve Squadron, she was kept in commission for only part of the year. In 1895, Sfax was involved in an experimental bombardment of simulated fortifications that demonstrated the difficulty of suppressing prepared defenses. She briefly served on the North American station in 1899, but by 1901, had been reduced to reserve. She was struck from the naval register in 1906 and subsequently broken up. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   6 √ó guns   2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó compound steam engines  March 1882  June 1887  Broken up, 1906 } Tage Tage early in her career Tage was an enlarged version of Sfax ordered in 1885, the next vessel built under the 1878 construction program. She was more than fifty percent larger than her predecessor in terms of displacement; the increase in size was primarily used to install a significantly more powerful propulsion system and thereby attain a much higher speed, though she also carried an additional pair of main battery guns. Like Sfax, Tage was intended to operate as a commerce raider, and as such originally carried a barque sailing rig. She featured a tumblehome shape and a pronounced ram bow, which would become standard characteristics of French cruisers of the period. The ship spent the 1890s operating in the Mediterranean Sea, either as part of the active Mediterranean or the Reserve Squadron, the latter being typically activated for annual training exercises with the rest of the fleet. The ship was modernized in 1900, which included the installation of new water-tube boilers, removal of her sailing rig, and other alterations. After returning to service, she operated with the Newfoundland and Iceland Naval Division beginning in 1902, and later the Atlantic Squadron the following year. Tage was ultimately struck from the naval register in 1910 and then broken up for scrap. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó 164 mm guns   2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  July 1885  December 1890  Broken up, 1910 } Amiral C√©cille Amiral C√©cille in Villefranche-sur-Mer in late 1890 or 1891 Amiral C√©cille represented the third and final development of the basic Sfax design; she was in many respects a scaled-down version of Tage, though she was still larger than Sfax. She retained the same hull general hull shape, layout, and eight- gun main battery, but reverted to older compound engines. She nevertheless maintained a similar top speed to that of her predecessor. Amiral C√©cille spent the early 1890s with the main fleet in the Mediterranean Squadron, where she was primarily occupied with training exercises. After being overhauled in the mid-1890s, she was transferred to the Reserve Squadron in the Mediterranean, where she continued to participate in training maneuvers. The ship detached to join the Naval Division of the Atlantic Ocean in 1899, where she served for the next three years. Recalled home in 1902, she saw no further active service and she was hulked in 1907, before being broken up in 1919. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó 164 mm guns   2 √ó screw propellers compound steam engines  August 1886  September 1890  Broken up, 1919 } Davout Davout shortly before her completion In 1886, Admiral Th√©ophile Aube became the French Minister of Marine. Aube was a proponent of the ideas of the doctrine, which envisioned using a combination of cruisers and torpedo boats to defend France and attack enemy merchant shipping. His construction program mandated three more large cruisers similar to Sfax, Tage, and Amiral C√©cille, six small cruisers, and two medium vessels. Davout was the first of the medium vessels to be built; her design provided the basis for many of the later protected cruisers built by France. Davout had a relatively uneventful career; her completion was delayed by two years due to problems with her propulsion system. After entering service in 1893, she was assigned to the Reserve Squadron, based in the Mediterranean Sea. The ship spent the rest of the decade operating either with the Reserve Squadron for training exercises or as part of the training unit of the French fleet. In 1899, she received a major overhaul that included the installation of new boilers, and in 1902, she was assigned to the North Atlantic Station. By 1910, she had been struck from the naval register and was subsequently sold to ship breakers. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   6 √ó 164 mm guns   2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  September 1887  1891  Broken up, 1910 } Suchet Suchet shortly after completion, 1895 Suchet was the second medium ship ordered by Aube; she was originally intended to be a sister ship to Davout, but during construction of that vessel, the design staff realized that the engines were not powerful enough to allow Davout to reach her intended speed. As a result, Suchet was lengthened to accommodate larger engines, since she was not in an advanced state of construction, though Davout could not be similarly modified. The two ships served as prototypes for the later Friant-class of cruisers, though additional lengthening was required to reach the desired speed. After completing her sea trials in 1894, Suchet was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron the next year. She took part in the opening ceremonies for the Bizerte Canal later that year. She continued to operate with the unit through early 1897, when she was sent to the Levant Division in the eastern Mediterranean. The ship was reassigned to the Naval Division of the Atlantic Ocean in 1900, and she was one of the first responders to the 1902 eruption of Mount Pel√©e in May, helping to rescue survivors from Saint-Pierre and its harbor, along with other towns on the island of Martinique. In total, she evacuated around 1,200 people to Fort-de-France. The next month, she was involved in a minor diplomatic incident with Venezuela, where six Frenchmen had been arrested; Suchets intervention secured their release. The ship returned to France later in 1902, where she was placed in reserve. Struck from the naval register in 1906, Suchet was broken up for scrap. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   6 √ó 164 mm guns   2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  October 1887  1894  Broken up, 1906 } Forbin class Co√´tlogon underway, date unknown The three Forbin-class cruisers were the first small cruisers ordered under Aube's construction program, though their development predated his tenure as naval minister. The had requested a new design for fast scouts for the ironclad battleships of the main fleet. They specified a displacement of around in 1879, which resulted in the final French unprotected cruiser, . That vessel, designed by Louis-√âmile Bertin, provided the basis for an improved version that incorporated an armor deck, heavier armament, and higher top speed. Forbin spent most of her career in the Mediterranean in the Reserve Squadron, while Surcouf served in the Northern Squadron in the English Channel. Co√´tlogon suffered from machinery problems that significantly delayed her completion, and after finally entering service in 1894, joined Surcouf in the Northern Squadron. All three ships were in reserve by 1901. Co√´tlogon was discarded in 1906, while Forbin was converted into a collier in 1913. Surcouf was the only member of the class still in active service during World War I, and she was deployed later in the conflict to the Gulf of Guinea. Forbin was scrapped in 1919 and Surcouf was sold to ship breakers two years later. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  4 √ó guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  2 √ó screw propellers compound steam engines  May 1886  February 1889  Broken up, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   May 1886  1890  Broken up, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1887  August 1894  Broken up, 1906 } Troude class Lalande in the early 1890s The three Troude-class cruisers, which were an iterative development of the Forbin design, completed the requirement for six fleet scouts under Aube's program. The two classes were broadly identical, being generally the same size, carrying the same armament, and having the same maximum speed. Minor alterations included a relocation of the main battery sponsons and the addition of armor plate to the main conning tower. All three members of the class served in the Mediterranean Squadron in their early careers, where they took part in routine training exercises. In 1897, Troude became the flagship of the Levant Division, and was later transferred to the North Atlantic Division in 1899. All three ships were in reserve by 1901. Troude was reactivated for a brief stint in the North Atlantic from 1904 to 1905, while Lalande returned to service in the Mediterranean in 1906. Troude was discarded in 1907 or 1908 and Lalande was broken up for scrap in 1912. Cosmao remained in reserve until the start of World War I in August 1914, when she was recommissioned to patrol the coast of French Morocco. She, too, was scrapped after the war in 1922. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  4 √ó 138 mm guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  2 √ó screw propellers compound steam engines 20.5 kn  November 1886  January 1891  Broken up, 1907 or 1908 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1887  October 1890  Broken up, 1912 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1887  1891  Broken up, 1922 } Alger class Jean Bart early in her career The last vessels to be ordered during Aube's tenure as naval minister, the three Alger-class vessels filled the requirement for the three medium cruisers. Enlarged versions of the Suchet design, the Algers increased the caliber of the secondary battery from to . They proved to be the last of the larger commerce raiding cruisers ordered by Aube, though the French Navy would later return to the idea with and in the late 1890s. After entering service, Alger and Isly were assigned to the Northern Squadron, while Jean Bart operated with the Mediterranean Squadron until 1895, when she, too, joined the Northern Squadron. That year, Alger and Isly were sent to French Indochina, and they were followed by Jean Bart followed in 1898. By that time, Alger had returned to France to serve in the Mediterranean. Jean Bart was present in the Far East during the Boxer Uprising in Qing China the following year, by which time Isly had been transferred to the North Atlantic station. Alger embarked on a second tour in East Asia in the mid-1900s, though records of when she left France are unclear. Jean Bart was wrecked off the coast of the Western Sahara in 1907 and could not be refloated. Isly was converted into a depot ship in 1909 and Alger was hulked in 1911; the former was sold to ship breakers in 1914, but Alger remained in the French Navy's inventory until 1939. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  4 √ó 164 mm guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  November 1887  1891  Broken up, 1939 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   August 1887  1893  Broken up, 1914 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   September 1887  1891  Wrecked, 1907 } Friant class Friant in port, lightly loaded By the late 1880s, the French Navy had come to regard Italy and its ally Germany as a more pressing threat than France's traditional rival, Great Britain. As a result of a major increase in tensions between France and Italy in the 1880s, the French Navy embarked on a major construction program in 1890 that included a total of seventy new cruisers to strengthen the main fleet and the forces available for deployment in the French colonial empire. The Friant class was the first group to be authorized under the new program, and their design was based on that of Davout and Suchet, albeit with significant modifications. Friant and Chasseloup-Laubaut initially served with the Northern Squadron, while Bugeaud operated in the Mediterranean Squadron. Bugeaud became the flagship of the Levant Division in 1898, which operated as part of the International Squadron that intervened in the Cretan Revolt of 1897‚Äì1898. All three members of the class were sent to East Asia in response to the Boxer Uprising by 1901, and they remained in the region through the mid-1900s. Bugeaud was badly worn out by her time in the Far East, and she was sold for scrap in 1907. That year, Chasseloup-Laubat visited the United States during the Jamestown Exposition. Chasseloup-Laubat was reduced to a storage hulk in 1911, but Friant remained in active service through the start of World War I in August 1914. She operated with cruiser squadrons patrolling for German commerce raiders early in the war and was later sent to patrol the formerly-German colony of Kamerun. Chasseloup-Laubat was converted into a distilling ship to support the main French fleet at Corfu while Friant ended the war having been rebuilt into a repair ship. The latter vessel was sold for scrap in 1920, while Chasseloup-Laubat ultimately foundered in 1926 after having been abandoned in the bay of Nouadhibou, French Mauritania. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  6 √ó 164 mm guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  1891  April 1895  Broken up, 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   June 1891  May 1896  Broken up, 1907 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   June 1891  1895  Abandoned and foundered, 1926 } Linois class Linois early in her career, before 1898 The Linois-class cruisers were ordered under the same construction program, and they were an improvement upon the Troude design, the primary improvement being an increased freeboard for better seakeeping. They also featured a strengthened armament with more modern, quick-firing guns for the main battery, additional light guns for close-range defense, and more powerful torpedo tubes. They proved to be the last of the small, 2,000-ton cruisers built for the French fleet. All three members of the class served with the Mediterranean Squadron upon entering service in the mid- to-late 1890s. During this period, they were primarily occupied with peacetime training maneuvers. Lavoisier was transferred to the Newfoundland and Iceland Naval Division in 1903, where she patrolled fisheries for the next decade. After uneventful careers, Linois and Galil√©e were discarded in 1910 and 1911, respectively, having spent less than fifteen years in service. Lavoisier was the only member of the class still in commission at the start of World War I in August 1914, and she was used to patrol for German warships and submarines in various secondary theaters, ending the war in the Syrian Naval Division, where she remained through the end of the war. She was ultimately struck from the naval register in 1920 and thereafter broken up. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  4 √ó 138 mm guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines 20.5 knots  August 1892  1895  Broken up, 1910 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1893  September 1897  Broken up, 1911 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   January 1895  April 1898  Broken up, 1920 } Descartes class Pascal, 1897‚Äì1900 The Descartes class, also ordered under the 1890 program, marked a break from previous French cruiser designs, which traced their origin to either Davout or Milan. They nevertheless featured many of the characteristics of earlier vessels, including a tumblehome hull, ram bow, and armament carried in sponsons. The ships were fitted with wood and copper sheathing to protect their hull on extended voyages overseas, improving their suitability for use in the French colonies. Descartes and Pascal were initially sent to French Indochina in the late 1890s, where they participated in the campaign to suppress the Boxer Uprising. Descartes was recalled to France in 1902 to serve in the Atlantic Division, while Pascal remained in East Asia, serving until 1904 when she was deactivated due to poor condition. Descartes was sent back to East Asia in 1905 and later to French Madagascar before returning to France in 1907, thereafter serving with the main French fleets in the Mediterranean Sea and English Channel. Pascal was sold to ship breakers in 1911, while Descartes served another stint in the Atlantic Division. She remained there during the first three years of World War I before returning to France in 1917, where she was disarmed and decommissioned. She was struck from the naval register in 1920, but what ultimately became of the ship is unknown. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 √ó 164 mm guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines 19.5 knots  August 1892  July 1896  Discarded, 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   December 1893  1897  Broken up, 1911 } D'Assas class Cassard, date unknown The D'Assas class was an improvement over the Friant design; they carried the same armament on the same size hull, but with improved armor protection. All three ships began service in the Mediterranean Squadron in the late 1890s, though D'Assas was later transferred to the Northern Squadron in 1901 and then to French Indochina in 1904. Du Chayla supported an amphibious landing in French Morocco in 1907 and Cassard joined her there the following year. D'Assas was discarded in 1914, but the other two members of the class saw service during World War I, primarily patrolling the Atlantic for German commerce raiders. Both ships were partially disarmed late in the conflict and Cassard became a gunnery training ship while Du Chayla remained in active service. She took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1919 before being sold to ship breakers in 1920, while Cassard lingered on in service until 1924, when she, too, was sold for scrap. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  6 √ó 164 mm guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines 20 knots  1894  March 1898  Broken up, 1914 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1894  February1898  Broken up, 1925 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   March 1894  February 1898  Broken up, 1933 } Catinat class Catinat, date unknown The two Catinat-class cruisers were derivatives of the Descartes design, with some alterations to the layout of the armament, a slight reduction in the thickness of the armor deck, and equipment to carry and lay fifty naval mines. They were otherwise very similar, carrying the same armament and propulsion system. Like the Descartes-class ships, they were intended to serve in the colonies. Catinat served briefly with the Northern Squadron in 1898 and 1899 before being placed in reserve; thereafter, she and Protet served the entirety of their active careers abroad. Protet was sent to the Pacific in 1899 after being completed, and she remained there through 1905 to protect French interests. Catinat was sent on a brief stint to French Madagascar in 1901 through at least 1902, before returning to France at some point before 1905. Early that year, she was sent to the Pacific to replace her sister ship, remaining there through at least 1908. No records of her activities thereafter survive. That year, Protet was converted into a training ship for the Gunnery School, though she was sold for scrap in 1910. Catinat was discarded the following year. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 √ó 164 mm guns  rowspan=\\"2\\"   rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines 19.5 to 20 knots  February 1894  1898  Broken up, 1911 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   March 1896  February 1899  Broken up, 1910 } D'Entrecasteaux D'Entrecasteaux underway during sea trials in 1898 Through the 1880s and early 1890s, arguments continued about the types of cruisers that should be built. Traditionalist officers preferred armored cruisers and small scouts like the Forbin and Troude classes, while advocates of the pressed for more large commerce raiders like those that had been ordered by Aube. The acquisition of French Indochina during this period gave leverage to the latter group, who secured approval for a large protected cruiser that was to serve as the flagship of a new cruiser squadron that would be permanently based there. The new vessel, which became D'Entrecasteaux, was armed with a main battery of two guns, the largest weapons ever mounted on any French cruiser. D'Entrecasteaux spent much of her early career in French Indochina, serving there from 1900 to 1903, and then from 1905 to 1909. During this period, she saw action in the Boxer Uprising. She was modernized between 1909 and 1912, thereafter being used as a training ship until the start of World War I. The ship was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean, helping to defend the Suez Canal in early 1915 and bombarding Ottoman forces through early 1916. She served in a variety of theaters thereafter, but saw no further action. After the war, the ship was loaned to the Belgian Navy for use as a depot ship until 1926. She was then sold to the Polish Navy the following year, renamed Kr√≥l W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV and then Ba≈Çtyk, and was used as a stationary training vessel until the start of World War II in September 1940. The ship was damaged by German dive bombers, seized by the Germans, and later scrapped. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó guns   2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  September 1894  1899  Broken up, 1942 } Guichen Guichen, date unknown The proponents of the secured approval for another pair of large cruisers, the first of which became Guichen. These new vessels were intended to serve as long-range commerce raiders, and their design was based on the United States Navy's s. Both ships were intended to resemble passenger liners, which would help them evade discovery while conducting commerce raiding operations. Because she was meant to attack unarmed merchant shipping, Guichen carried a very weak armament for her size. Guichen initially served with the Mediterranean Squadron during her lengthy sea trials, followed by a stint in the Northern Squadron. She was sent to the Far East in response to the Boxer Uprising by early 1901, returning to France the following year. Another deployment to East Asian waters came in 1905 and ended in 1907 with her return to France. She had been reduced to reserve by 1911 and saw little further activity until the start of World War I in July 1914. Guichen was mobilized into the 2nd Light Squadron and tasked with patrolling the western end of the English Channel. Guichen was transferred to the Mediterranean Sea in May 1915, serving initially with the main French fleet that blockaded the Austro- Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea. Later in the year, she was reassigned to the Syrian Division that patrolled the coast of Ottoman Syria, where she helped to evacuate some 4,000 Armenian civilians fleeing the Armenian Genocide. By 1917, she had been reduced to a fast transport operating between Italy and Greece. After the war, she took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea, but after her crew mutinied in 1919, she was recalled to France, where she was eventually struck from the naval register in 1921 and broken up. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó 164 mm guns   3 √ó screw propellers 3 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  October 1895  November 1899  Broken up, 1921 } Ch√¢teaurenault Ch√¢teaurenault coaling in Toulon during World War I Ch√¢teaurenault was the second large commerce raider ordered in 1894; in most respects she was very similar to Guichen, though she differed markedly in appearance. She was slightly faster than Guichen, and the French Navy considered her to be a better steamer. Ch√¢teaurenault spent much of her early career overseas in French Indochina, deploying there immediately after her commissioning in 1902 through mid 1904, and then again in 1905‚Äì1906. She was reduced to reserve in 1907 and then modified to serve as a fast minelayer the following year. She was assigned to the Reserve Division of the Mediterranean Squadron. She saw little further activity until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. The ship was mobilized into the 2nd Light Squadron and based in the western English Channel. She was moved to the Mediterranean Sea in early 1915 and then to French Senegal to search for German commerce raiders in early 1916. Having been transferred back to the Mediterranean by October 1916, she rescued survivors from the troopship that had been sunk by a German U-boat. Ch√¢teaurenault was herself torpedoed and sunk in December 1917, but she sank slowly enough for her crew to be taken off by a pair of destroyers, which in turn sank the German submarine. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2 √ó 164 mm guns   3 √ó screw propellers 3 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  May 1896  1902  Sunk, 14 December 1917 } D'Estr√©es class Infernet, date unknown The D'Estr√©es class was ordered to supplement the vessels available for service in the colonies. Two ships were initially authorized in 1896 and a third followed in 1897, though that vessel was ultimately not built. They were significantly smaller than earlier colonial cruisers and they carried a much lighter armament. The D'Estr√©es class proved to be the final protected cruiser design built for overseas service, as the French Navy transitioned to more powerful armored cruisers for that role in the late 1890s. D'Estr√©es and Infernet initially served in the Northern Squadron after entering service in the late 1890s, though they were quickly transferred elsewhere. D'Estr√©es went to the Atlantic station in 1902, while Infernet had been sent to French Madagascar by 1901. The latter ship then served a stint in the East Indies from 1903 to 1905, thereafter returning to France, where she was lost in an accidental grounding in 1910. D'Estr√©es was assigned to the 2nd Light Division at the start of World War I in August 1914, before being moved to the Syrian Division. There, she took part in operations against Ottoman forces ashore. She patrolled the Red Sea and Indian Ocean from 1916 to the end of the war in 1918. D'Estr√©es was then sent to East Asia, where she served until being discarded in 1922. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  2 √ó 138 mm guns  rowspan=\\"3\\"   rowspan=\\"3\\"  2 √ó screw propellers 2 √ó triple-expansion steam engines 20 to 20.5 knots  March 1897  1899  Broken up, 1924 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   December 1896  1900  Wrecked, 1910 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  K3  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî } Jurien de la Gravi√®re Jurien de la Gravi√®re underway early in her career Jurien de la Gravi√®re was the final French protected cruiser; her design originated in the disputes over the large protected cruisers built in the mid-1890s. By that time, Admiral Armand Besnard had become the naval minister, and he requested a sister ship to D'Entrecasteaux, which was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies in 1896. The following year, the legislature approved Besnard's request to build a scaled down vessel, which became Jurien de la Gravi√®re. Completed in 1903, Jurien de la Gravi√®re initially served in the Atlantic Naval Division. Jurien de la Gravi√®re had been transferred to the Reserve Division of the Mediterranean Squadron by 1911, though she was reactivated in 1913 to serve with the main French fleet. She remained on active service into the start of World War I, and after ensuring the safe passage of French Army units, the fleet entered the Adriatic Sea to engage the Austro-Hungarian Navy and fought the Battle of Antivari. Jurien de la Gravi√®re saw no further action during the conflict. The French fleet withdrew to blockade the southern end of the Adriatic and the Austro-Hungarians refused to send their fleet to engage them. After Italy's entry into the war in 1915, the French turned over control of the blockade and withdrew the bulk of the fleet. In October 1916, Jurien de la Gravi√®re was detached to bombard the southern Anatolian coast of the Ottoman Empire. Later that year the fleet was moved to Greek waters to try to coerce the neutral Greek government to join the Allies, which they eventually did. Coal shortages kept the French from conducting any significant operations in 1918. After the war, Jurien de la Gravi√®re served with the Syrian Division until early 1920, when she was recalled to France. She was subsequently sold to ship breakers. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   8 √ó 164 mm guns   3 √ó screw propellers 3 √ó triple-expansion steam engines  November 1897  1903  Broken up, 1922 }  Notes  References =Books=      =Journals=                 * Protected cruisers French protected cruisers ","title":"List of protected cruisers of France"},{"id":"65329272","text":"James C.

Originally a Tartessian settlement, it was named Laelia by Roman settlers in the 2nd century BC. It was described by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History as lying on the Menoba River (Guadiamar) near the towns of Olontigi and Lastigi. These three cities had their own mints and, thus, are well attested from numismatic evidence. Their exact location, however, has not been definitively established. All three were probably located relatively close to Aznalc√≥llar, where the materials for their coins were probably mined. The settlement at the Cerro de la Cabeza, populated until the 13th century, most likely corresponds to Laelia given the archaeological evidence obtained from excavations in 1981. After Pliny, Ptolemy mentioned the city (Lailia) as a settlement by the Turdetani. No other classical accounts of the city have survived. In 1634, Rodrigo Caro proposed Aracena as the location for Laelia according to Ptolemy's indications, and in 1754 Enrique Fl√≥rez proposed Berrocal, also in the Province of Huelva. Based on Pliny's and Ptolemy's accounts, Juan Agust√≠n Ce√°n Berm√∫dez (1832), Antonio Delgado (1871) and Rodrigo Amador de los R√≠os (1891) agreed on a location in or near Sanl√∫car la Mayor, suggesting the Cortijo de la Pisana (or Pizana), located between Gerena and Olivares. Both Ce√°n Berm√∫dez and Sebasti√°n Mi√±ano, in his geographical dictionary, mention also Albaida, closer to Olivares, as a possible site, despite the lack of archaeological evidence for a settlement in that locality.

It was forcefully removed from a natural reserve area where it had been unlawfully erected, and currently belongs to the collections of the Moderna Museet.  The sculpture  The name, Omfalos, derives from the Greek ŒøŒºœÜŒ±ŒªœåœÇ (omphalos), meaning \\"center of the world\\". It refers to the ancient sculpture Omphalos found at Delphi, Greece. The sculpture was erected in 1999 in the Kullaberg natural reserve in Sk√•ne County, Sweden, and takes the form of a 1.6 meter tall pillar. The local authorities deemed the construction of Omfalos to be in violation of the regulations governing the natural reserve, and initiated a legal process to have it destroyed or removed from the site. Lars Vilks denied being the creator of the work, but it was attributed to him over the course of the proceedings. In 2001, a crane barge transported the sculpture from the site, damaging it in the process. The then-current owner, the artist Ernst Billgren, donated it to the Moderna Museet, a modern art museum in Stockholm, Sweden. Lars Vilks was granted the authorities' approval to erect an 8 cm memorial at the original site.  Relation to other works  Lars Vilks had previously and without permission erected two other sculptures in the Kullaberg natural reserve - the Nimis and the Arx, made from driftwood and rock respectively, in 1980. When they were discovered in 1982, the local authorities decided that they were in violation of building code laws. Despite the authorities' efforts to have Nimis and Arx removed as well as several instances of vandalism and fire, repaired versions of both sculptures were still standing 40 years after their construction. Lars Vilks considers the sculptures and the controversy surrounding them to be works of conceptual art, with the legal proceedings comprising the most important part. The area, proclaimed by Vilks as the sovereign micronation of Ladonia, has become a tourist attraction with approximately 90,000 visitors annually.

History The original forge which stands at the gates of the Thuringian forest. The Prussian commissioner for firearms manufacturing, Carl Gottlieb Haenel, began producing bicycles and weapons in 1840 ‚Äî a combination which was not uncommon at the time as it required similar means of production and skills. In 1887, the Suhl-based weapons designer C. W. Aydt joined the company in order to produce his Aydt target rifle and later the Aydt target pistol for sporting. In 1879, the German Army introduced the M1879 Reichsrevolver and a smaller derivative, the M1883. Haenel was awarded a share of the manufacturing for these firearms as part of a consortium, named the Suhl Konsortium, formed with the sporting arms manufacturer V. Ch. Schilling. The firearms they produced were marked with the signature \\"VCS CGH Suhl\\" in reference to their initials and Suhl origin. Haenel later produced hunting weapons, bayonets and, during World War I, produced vast quantities of the Mauser Model 98 for the German Army. =1920s= In 1921, Hugo Schmeisser joined the company which then began manufacturing pocket pistols based on his designs. This period also marked the introduction of the automatic firearm and, despite a ban by the Treaty of Versailles, the company began developing automatic submachine guns to Schmeisser's designs. Schmessier drew upon experience and knowledge he had gained from his father, Louis Schmeisser, otherwise known as the \\"Father of the Automatic Carbine\\" due to his work on Bergmann machine guns. In 1928, the company developed the MP28, a submachine gun derived from the MP18, and it was in use with the German police by 1928. Deliveries were also made to South Africa, Spain, Japan and the Republic of China through a license agreement with a Belgian company, named Baynard. =1930s and 1940s= MP40 submachine gun The MKb 42(H), the precursor to the StG 44 assault rifle Despite the success of Hugo Schmeisser, the company ran into bankruptcy several times between 1929 and 1934. In 1933, the company formed an association with ten other Suhl and Zella-Mehlis arms companies to guarantee a share of armament contracts from the newly-arisen Nazi government. This association was named the United Suhl-Zella-Mehlisser Arms Factories () and had direct relations with the Wehrmacht administration. The company, along with its associates, established their own offices in Berlin. 1935 saw a dramatic increase in arms production in the build up to World War II and a new automatic firearm with an intermediate cartridge was developed. The 7.92√ó33mm chambered MP43 (originally known as the Mkb 42(H)) assault rifle was devised to stand out from the Erma Werke MP38/MP40 submachine gun with its higher performance and economic design which was manufactured through a novel factory stamping technique. Over 10,000 units were produced as early as 1943 but, in the same year, production was halted by Adolf Hitler. Hitler later approved mass production following testing with troops. On entering service, the weapon was known as the Sturmgewehr 44 (StG 44). =1950s= Following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, U.S. forces briefly occupied the city of Suhl and imposed a production ban on all arms factories. Following the evacuation of American troops, the area became occupied by the Soviet Army in what would later become East Germany. Around 50 StG 44's were transferred to the Soviet Union for technical analysis, as well as 10,785 weapon blueprints which were considered war reparations. The company was then consolidated as the VEB Vehicle and Hunting Weapons Factory \\"Ernst Th√§lmann\\" () and later began producing air rifles and hunting carbines under the brand name Haenel Suhl. =Recent= In 2008, the company was reesthablished and adopted its original name of C. G. Haenel. It now belongs to Merkel, which is in turn part of Caracal International in the United Arab Emirates. The company's first product in 2008 was the Haenel RS8 7.62√ó51mm NATO/.308 Winchester sniper rifle which, in 2009, lead to the development of a larger Haenel RS9 .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6√ó70mm) version. That same year saw the introduction of a new range of hunting rifles, named the Jaeger 8 series. This was followed by the single-shot Jaeger 9, the bolt action Jaeger 10, the semi-automatic SLB 2000+, which was originally developed by Heckler & Koch, and the Jaeger 11 shotgun. In February 2016, the Bundeswehr ordered the Haenel RS9 as its new medium-range sniper rifle, designated the G29. This was followed by an order from the Hamburg Police for the company's Haenel CR 223 semi-automatic rifle in November. These were reportedly withdrawn from use in 2017 due to persistent jamming. These problems were attributed to the ammunition being used by the Hamburg Police and Haenel stated it would rectify the problem. In January 2019, the company's MK 556 assault rifle was shortlisted alongside the Heckler & Koch HK416 and HK433 as a potential replacement for the Bundeswehr's G36 service rifle. The competition was widely expected to be won by Heckler and Koch which has supplied previous service rifles to the German military, including the most recent two, the G3 and the G36. However, despite expectations, the Bundeswehr selected the MK 556 on 15 September 2020. The contract, currently worth ‚Ç¨245 million, is to deliver 120,000 rifles. On 9 October 2020, the German Federal Ministry of Defence withdrew their intended award decision, seemingly leaving the potential remaining G36 replacements as either the HK416, HK433 or MK 556 after concluding a reentered evaluation phase.

Subject The subject of the painting, from whence its title, is the exemplary story of Roman Charity. The story, part of the Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium,Book V, 5.4.7 was written down by the ancient Roman historian Valerius Maximus. A painting in the Temple of Pietas reportedly depicted the scene.Mary Beagon, The Elder Pliny on the Human Animal: Natural History Book 7 (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 314 online. Wall paintings and terracotta statues from the first century, excavated in Pompeii, suggest that the visual representations of Pero and Cimon might have been common in Ancient Rome. It is difficult to say whether said representations were created in response to Maximus's story or preceded and possibly inspired his story.Jutta Sperling, Roman Charity: Queer Lactations in Early Modern Visual Culture (Bielefeld: transcript Verlag, 2016), p. 13. Among the Romans, the theme echoed Juno's breastfeeding of the adult Hercules, an Etruscan myth.Nancy Thomson de Grummond, Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006), pp. 83‚Äì84. Valerius Maximus' story tells of a certain Cimon, an aged man starving to death in prison, and of his daughter Pero who, allowed by the jailer, visits him, and suckles her starving father. Background De Crayer's early approach was in the trend of the 16th century tradition of Antwerp artists such as Marten de Vos and Hendrik de Clerck. This style was characterized by the unnatural perspective and the crowding of long wooden figures in the foreground.Hans Vlieghe. \\"Crayer, Gaspar de.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online Oxford University Press, Web 21 February 2017. From 1618, the painter came under the influence of Rubens. The level of borrowing of motifs from Rubens suggests that he had some contract with the workshop of Rubens, since de Crayer might have drawn inspiration for some of his subjects and models only from thence.Matthias Depoorter, Gaspar de Crayer at barokinvlaanderen The influence is shown in a more monumental rendering of figures in more balanced compositions. Between 1638 and 1648 de Crayer's compositions start to display a lighter tonality and his figures become softer and more sentimental in appearance. This may have been influenced by the later work of Rubens. His work also showed a trace of the Venetian 16th-century masters, in particular Titian and Paolo Veronese. De Crayer, however, never visited Italy and he mostly knew their work through the prints of Agostino Carracci. In later works, the influence of Caravaggio is also clear. De Crayer, who neither studied in nor visited Italy, had to reinterpret the Italians' approaches from secondary sources. The clearest influence on the Prado's Caritas, reportedly painted in early 1625, is that of Rubens.Gaspard DE CRAYER, Caritas Romana at Gallerie Jan de Maere Painting The painting depicts the dramatic climax of Maximus' story, whereby it subsumes it. The starving Cimon reclines in the lap of a his young daughter who is suckling him. The setting is Cimon's cell. There is a notice affixed to the wall, just above Pero's fingers on the 2-dimensional surface of the painting. Her fingers gently touch her father's head. There is some chiaroscuro to the painting, and the sensuality of Pero's mien, rather than her uncovered breast, contrasts with the devotion the painting exudes.

Context The evolution of Blaenau's passenger stations was complex with five different railway companies providing services to the area. Diphwys was the northern passenger terminus of the narrow gauge Festiniog and Blaenau Railway (F&BR;); it opened with the line on 30 May 1868. The F&BR; ran the three and a half route miles northwards from its southern terminus at Llan Ffestiniog to a junction with the Ffestiniog Railway (FR) at Dolgarregddu Junction about north west of Diphwys (F&BR;) station. Freight trains passed between the FR and F&BR; at Dolgarregddu Junction, but not passenger trains. The station was a passenger station, whose main but not sole traffic was quarrymen travelling to and from work. There was a coal siding, a private siding and a run-round loop, but the warehouse and extensive interchange sidings came later with the station's standard gauge replacement. In common with all other F&BR; stations there were no platforms, as carriages were very low to the ground passengers boarded from and alighted to the trackside. Only one photograph of the station has been published. The location is indisputable, with the Queens Hotel in the background. The station building in view looks like weatherboarding, which could explain the corrugated appearance of the other F&BR; stations, no published photo of which was taken close-up. The only description of the station building in print reads \\"Duffws was a stone building, suitably semi-pretentious enough to house the Company's offices! That was about all, there being no platform, only a run round loop and, beyond the station, a single siding for coal. A lane ran up beside the station towards the Queens Hotel to reach the main street; across and over on the other side was (for the first year or two anyway) the even more primitive station of the Festiniog Railway.\\" It is possible that the stone building was later than the photo, or off-shot, but it is not visible in the published photograph. Diphwys (F&BR;) station and the Ffestiniog Railway's station were completely separate entities, run by different companies on opposite sides of Church Street. Although officially spelled differently, both could be referred to in contemporary literature simply as \\"Duffws\\". To compound the potential for confusion contemporary F&BR; sources sometimes referred to their station in Blaenau not as Diphwys, but as \\"Dinas\\", though timetables used \\"Diphwys\\". The FR also had a Dinas station in another part of Blaenau and a third Dinas station came later with the Welsh Highland Railway, giving more opportunities for bewilderment. Quick, uniquely, refers to the station as plain \\"Blaenau\\". Services The February 1878 timetable shows that all trains called at all stations on the line, with * Northbound (\\"Up\\") ** four public trains running Monday to Saturday ** an unadvertised morning workmen's train running Monday to Saturday ** two public evening trains on Saturdays only *** The journey time from to Duffws was 20 minutes. * Southbound (\\"Down\\") ** four public trains running Monday to Saturday ** a morning workmen's train running Monday to Saturday ** two public evening trains on Saturdays only ** a teatime workmen's train on Saturdays only *** The journey time from Duffws to was 20 minutes. * There was no Sunday service. Through passengers from (say) to would alight at the F&BR;'s Diphwys station and walk across Church Street in Blaenau to the Festiniog Railway's Duffws station. Most trains were timetabled to make this process workable, if tight. Whether connecting trains were held in the case of late running is not recorded. In the line's early days many trains were \\"mixed\\", but this was stopped in 1877. Unlike most railways in the area passengers were the line's mainstay. In 1879 - a typical year - passenger receipts were ¬£1406 compared with ¬£416 for goods. No figures have been published specifically for Duffws. The standard gauge approaches On 1 September 1882 the standard gauge Bala and Festiniog Railway reached Llan Ffestiniog from the south, enabling a passenger from (say) Bala to Duffws to transfer from a standard gauge train to a narrow gauge train at Llan by walking a few yards, much as modern-day passengers transfer between Conwy Valley Line and Ffestiniog Railway trains at Blaenau Ffestiniog. From April the following year the narrow gauge line was converted to standard gauge. Narrow gauge trains continued to operate during the conversion, using a third rail. The rebuilding at Diphwys was total, with the F&BR; infrastructure obliterated and the site extended, though the Ffestiniog Railway's tracks which passed to the north of the site were sacrosanct. One source (only) indicates that for a period during the rebuilding Diphwyss (F&BR;) station closed, with a temporary terminus provided between .Glynllifon Street temporary terminus, via Festipedia and Cwmbowydd Road. Narrow gauge trains ceased running on 5 September 1883 with standard gauge services beginning on 10 September 1883. Duffws (F&BR;) station was closed permanently when the narrow gauge ended, being replaced by a standard gauge station known initially as Blaenau Festiniog, later as Blaenau Ffestiniog, later still as Blaenau Ffestiniog Central and locally as Blaenau GWR. The line reopened The standard gauge line through the site of Diphwys (F&BR;) station closed to passengers in 1960 and completely in 1961 but it was mothballed pending building the long-discussed cross-town link to enable trains to run along the Conwy Valley Line, through Blaenau and on to Trawsfynydd nuclear power station which was then being built. This link was built and a new line through the site opened on 24 April 1964, but none of Blaenau Ffestiniog Central's facilities were brought back to life. Spectacular change occurred in 1982 when two wholly new stations were built side by side on the site. On 22 March 1982 the ex-LNWR station was closed, being replaced by a wholly new build station on the former Ffestiniog Railway trackbed at Dolgarregddu Junction, yards from the site of Diphwys (F&BR;), then on 25 May 1982 the Ffestiniog Railway opened a wholly new station very close to where Duffws (F&BR;) had been. Through traffic to the nuclear plant and occasional passenger specials continued to pass through Diphwys' long built-over site using the standard gauge line which covered the F&BR; trackbed. The line south of the Diphwys (F&BR;) site closed again in 1998 as the nuclear plant was being decommissioned. Once more the route was mothballed in case a future use is found. The station site in the 21st Century In Summer 2016 the Network Rail and Ffestiniog Railway stations on the Diphwys (F&BR;) site were still going strong. The overgrown, mothballed and protected single track line still ran south of the site to the former nuclear flask loading point. The future Between 2000 and 2011 there were at least two attempts to put the line south of the Diphwys site to use. In 2011 there were proposals to use the rails as a recreational velorail track. Neither this nor the earlier idea came to anything. The possibility remains that the surviving line could see future preservation or reuse by the nuclear industry. To considerable local surprise fresh moves to reopen the line from Blaenau as far south as Trawsfynydd began in September 2016, with the formation of The Trawsfynydd & Blaenau Ffestiniog Community Railway Company. On 21 September at least one regional newspaper reported that \\"Volunteers are set to start work this weekend on clearing vegetation from the trackbed between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd.\\" The company was quoted as saying \\"We have been given a licence by Network Rail to clear and survey the line.\\" References =Sources=   * Further material    * External links * The station site on a navigable OS Map National Library of Scotland * The site on a navigable 1953 OS map npe Maps * The station and line Rail Map Online * Festiniog and Blaenau Railway, via Festipedia Category:Disused railway stations in Gwynedd Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1868 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1883 Category:Blaenau Ffestiniog ","title":"Diphwys railway station (Festiniog and Blaenau Railway)"},{"id":"65329681","text":"Jean Kienlen (21 October 1897 - 19 August 1954) was a French racing cyclist.

From 1936 to 1945, he was the deputy of the Bureau for the Russian Refugees in Germany. Post-1942, Taboritsky was a member of the Nazi Party and worked together with Gestapo.  Biography  = Early years = Sergey and his younger brother, Nikolay Taborissky (the spelling of his name at the beginning of the XX century was inconsistent; during the emigration years, the \\"Taboritsky\\" variant was used) were the illegitimate children of the baptized Jewish tailor and owner of a fashion shop Anna Vladimirovna and her cohabitant, Sergey Alexandrovich Zapevalov (who broke with her in 1901). Both brothers were raised in the Orthodox Christian faith. The godfather of Taboritsky was the future Ober-Procurator Vladimir Sabler. The brothers had the surname of Anna Vladimirovna's first husband, also a Jew, Wulf Aizikovich Taborissky, the tradesman of Ashmyany, who had left the country long before both of them were born, in 1887. According to the documents, they were regarded as the children of Wulf Taborissky, since the first divorce of their mother occurred only in 1899. The mother became a second guild merchant and married the noble named Marasanov, taking his surname. Anna Marasanova died in March 1914 in France, In 1915, after their mother's death, brothers Sergey and Nikolay unsuccessfully tried to reach the Petrograd spiritual consistory with a plea to recognize them as the children of the \\"Russian Orthodox face\\" and rid them of the \\"Cain's seal\\", citing their religious and monarchist sentiments. He graduated from the Realschule of Gurevich in 1915. The later stories of Taboritsky about his participation in the World War I fightings under the command of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich as part of the Caucasian Native Cavalry Division can't be considered as reliable, as documented information on his activities in 1915-1919 has not been found. According to some reports, he was an assistant to the commissioner from the State Duma and deputy Georgy Deryugin. After the February Revolution, he was in Ukraine, from there he left for Germany. In Kiev, in a Petlyurite prison, he became acquainted with the monarchist Pyotr Nikiforovich Popov (who called himself ‚ÄúShabelsky-Bork‚Äù), with whom he then constantly communicated in exile. = Emigration = At first, Taboritsky lived in Berlin, then in Mecklenburg and from January to March 1922 in Munich. During that period, he engaged in editorial activities in the magazine Luch sveta where his poems were published. Before the assassination attempt on Paul Milyukov, he worked as a typewriter. It is known that for ideological reasons he refused to take the commissions from the Soviet Union. In 1921, accidentally meeting the former State Duma politician Alexander Guchkov on a street in Berlin, Taboritsky attacked him and beat him with an umbrella, for which he spent several days in a local prison. = Assassination attempt against Milyukov = Together with Shabelsky-Bork, Taboritsky participated in the preparation of the assassination attempt against Paul Milyukov. To accomplish that, they drove from Munich to Berlin. During the lecture of Milyukov, Taboritsky opened fire. When Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov rushed at Shabelsky, striking him in the arm in which he was holding a revolver, Taboritsky shot three times at point-blank range at Nabokov. Nabokov was immediately killed by a shot in the heart. After this, Taboritsky went to the wardrobe and, taking his clothes, went to the exit door, but some woman exclaimed: ‚ÄúHere is a killer!‚Äù, and Taboritsky was detained by the crowd. In addition to Nabokov who died on the spot during the attempted indiscriminate shooting, 9 people were injured, including the chairman of the Berlin group of the Kadet party, L. E. Elyashev, and one of the editors of the ‚ÄúRul‚Äù newspaper, Avgust Kaminka. A medical examination of Shabelsky-Bork and Taboritsky showed that both had long been using drugs, a strong dose of which was taken on the day of the assassination. The trial of the assassination attempt against Milyukov took place on July 3‚Äì7, 1922, in the Berlin Criminal Court in Moabit. The court sentenced Taboritsky to 14 years of hard labor for complicity in the attempt and intentionally inflicting serious wounds on Nabokov that caused his death. But already in the spring of 1927 he was released under an amnesty. = Activities under the Nazi regime = Since May 1936 Taboritsky was the deputy of General Vasily Biskupsky for the Nazi-created Bureau for Russian Refugees in Germany (Vertrauensstelle f√ºr russische Fl√ºchtlinge in Deutschland). Taboritsky's duties included maintaining a file cabinet of Russian emigration and political monitoring of its sentiments. After the outbreak of war with the USSR, he headed the recruitment of translators for the Wehrmacht among Russian emigrants . Taboritsky's activities were carried out in close contact with the Gestapo. Gleb Rahr describes Taboritsky as follows: ‚ÄúDry, lean, pointed, wizened, slightly weazened type, not flowering, but fading‚Äù. In April 1937, Taboritsky married Elisabeth von Knorre, granddaughter of the astronomer Karl Friedrich Knorre, who was a member of the Nazi party since 1931. After numerous petitions (including those on the name of Goebbels) and refusals, he received German citizenship (1938) and joined the NSDAP (1942, retroactively adopted from the date of application of 1940). He hid the Jewish origin of his mother and attributed German roots to her, and he ascribed the Russian nobility for the fictitious father, \\"Vladimir Vasilievich Taboritsky,\\". Pretending to be of noble origin, he used the German surname with \\"von\\" (von Taboritzki). He claimed that the assassination attempt on the ‚Äúleader of Jewish democracy‚Äù and the ‚Äúhater of Germany‚Äù Milyukov, for which he was serving a criminal sentence, was a feat to his new homeland. He emphasized that he first made known the Protocols of Zion in Germany, and was proud of his persecution by Jews and ‚Äúleftists‚Äù. In 1939 he created the National Organization of Russian Youth (NORM). The organization was under the direct control of the SS. It was similar to the German Hitler Youth organization to which it was subordinate. In the last days of the war, Taboritsky fled from Berlin, later living in Limburg an der Lahn. He continued to occasionally publish in the Brazilian monarchist journal Vladimirsky Vestnik. Taboritsky died on 16 October 1980.

Overview  Smooth-On, Inc. is a privately owned US-based manufacturer of liquid rubbers, plastics, adhesives, and expanding foams. These materials are commonly used for mold making, resin casting, composite manufacturing, and industrial repair.  History  Smooth- On, Inc. was founded in 1895 by Vreeland Tompkins in Jersey City, New Jersey (then as Smooth-On Manufacturing Company). In 1895 Tompkins devised a powder compound that when mixed with water could be used to repair cracks and holes in iron. Marketed as Iron Cement, later iterations were formulated with solvents that would evaporate when heated or exposed to air. In the 1950's Smooth-On pivoted to production of epoxy resins and polysulfides to address the decline in iron and rise in plastics for industrial manufacturing. It relocated its manufacturing facilities to a larger site in Gillette, New Jersey in 1967 to increase production capacity. In the 1970's Smooth-On began formulating polyurethane rubbers and plastics. In 1997 manufacturing was moved to Easton, Pennsylvania and in 2014 to Macungie, Pennsylvania.  Acquisitions and Growth  Since the early 1990's, Smooth-On has grown through acquisitions of similar specialty chemical formulary manufacturers and distributors. * 1992: Smooth-On acquired G.P.

Early years Victor Eug√®ne Jules Harou was born on 25 September 1851 in Fayt-lez-Seneffe (today ), Hainaut Province, Belgium. His parents were Adrien-Victor-Joseph Harou and Victorine-Jos√©phine-Marguerite Velloni. His younger brother was Prosper Harou. He joined the army and entered military school on 1 December 1868. He entered the War School of 22 September 1874. He was promoted to lieutenant of the 5th line regiment. Colonial career Harou engaged with the Comit√© d'Etudes du Haut-Congo. On 15 August 1880 he boarded the Gaboon in Liverpool in the company of Paul N√®ve, , Louis Valcke and Vanden Boogaerde. They transferred to the Biafra at the mouth of the Niger, and reached Banana on 3 October 1880. On 6‚Äì8 October they traveled up the Congo River in the steamer Belgique to Vivi, where Augustus Sparhawk was the station commander. On 9 December 1880 Harou commanded a caravan of mules and donkey loaded with equipment to join the overall commander Henry Morton Stanley. He was seconded by N√®ve. They made their way eastward with difficulty along a poorly marked and uneven trail, and at one point had to take the cargo across the Boundi River by raft. Eventually they found Stanley near the place where he would establish the Isangila station on 24 February 1880. On 26 February 1881 Stanley, Harou and N√®ve boarded the Royal and steamed upstream from Isangila. At Nsouki they freed two Protestant missionaries, H. E. Crudgington and William Holman Bentley, whom the local people had taken prisoner. In March Braconnier joined the expedition. On 8 April 1881 they reached the mouth of the Eluala, in Basundi territory. They stopped at Ntombe-Mataka, where Braconnier and N√®ve stayed while Stanley and Harou continued northeast looking for a suitable place to found the new Manyanga post. They found a platform that dominated the river, where they laid the foundation of the post in May 1881. Local people arrived and objected, but settled for a monthly tribute of two pieces of cloth. Harou was made station commander, Braconnier and N√®ve reached the station early in May. Everyone fell ill with fever, including Stanley. On 20 April 1882 Harou was ordered by Stanley to return to Europe. His engagement was until August, but the hardships of his station at Manyanga-Nord were too much for his health. He handed over his command to Th√©odore Nilis. In 1883 he returned to lead a new journey of exploration. He served under Stanley for the Comit√© d'√âtudes and the International Association of the Congo until 1884. Harou died on 12 August 1923 in Ixelles, Belgium.

First mentioned in 1344, it may have developed out of the borough hundred court. It was originally held in a room on Corn Street but later moved to the Bristol Guildhall on Broad Street. The court absorbed the Mayor's Court and at least one of Bristol's court of piepowders. The Tolzey Court was limited in jurisdiction to actions arising in Bristol or its liberties and could award costs with no upper limit. It was valued by plaintiffs for its use of some aspects of lex mercatoria law, including the ability to try cases in the absence of a defendant and apply the principle of foreign attachment to recover costs from defendant's debtors. In the Victorian era it commonly used juries, which were otherwise unusual in civil trials. The Tolzey Court became popular in the 1960s as its fees were lower than the High Court or County Court. It was prevented from hearing repossession cases by the Protection from Eviction Act 1964 and abolished by the Courts Act 1971.  Origins  A 1673 map of Bristol. Corn Street runs left from the crossroads (south-west) and Broad Street upwards (north-west). The Tolzey Court is said to have originated in the Anglo-Saxon period but is first mentioned by name in 1344. It was possibly a development of the borough's original hundred court, which was confirmed in its jurisdiction by the Bristol town charter of 1188. The Tolzey Court was mentioned by a charter of 1373 that granted additional powers to the Mayor's Court, without affecting the jurisdiction of the Tolzey Court. The Tolzey Court is named after a room in a building on Corn Street used for the collection of tolls, and where it presumably first sat, though for much of the medieval era and later it sat in the Bristol Guildhall on Broad Street. The earliest surviving record of a case in the Tolzey Court held by the National Archives is one relating to rent of a house in Broad Street in 1476. By the 15th century the hundred court was in decline and the Tolzey Court sat more frequently, often sitting 3-5 times a week. During the town's three annual fair weeks the court did not sit, as a court of piepowders tried offences occurring at the markets. Later at least one of the piepowders courts was merged into the Tolzey Court. The Mayor's Court was merged with the Tolzey Court in the mid-18th century.  Jurisdiction and procedure  The court had jurisdiction over civil disputes where the action leading to the dispute arose within the boundaries of Bristol, or its liberties. In 1450 an ordinance defined the work of the Bristol courts. The Tolzey Court was to have jurisdiction over all civil matters except those relating to the export of wool, hides and lead which were to be tried at the Court of Staple and in matters of trespass and deceit where the Mayor's Court had jurisdiction. Bristol was one of the few places, London being another, whereby the King's Justices were excluded from jurisdiction (in Bristol this was by a 1373 charter). The Tolzey Court was therefore entitled to claim precedence over the King's Courts for matters arising within its area. The Tolzey Court was a court of record and was able to order costs as it saw fit, not being bound by an upper limit. The court was originally presided over by the bailiffs of the hundred but when Bristol became a royal residence the court was probably united with that of the palace and presided over by a seneschal or steward of the royal household. It later came under a sheriff and, after their number was increased to two by Henry VII, the court became known as the Sheriffs' Court. The court was probably brought under the control of the Common Council of Bristol by a 1461 charter of Edward IV. The court was attended by a legal officer known as a prothonotary, who probably played a similar role to that of a modern registrar. The court was authorised by four sergeants at mace, officers who carried out the court's orders, though these only had powers within the area of the court's jurisdiction. The court was popular for its adaptability in procedure when compared with common law courts. By the 13th century it had adopted some aspects of lex mercatoria (law merchant) law. In particular it allowed judgements to be made against absent defendants which was not possible under the common law. It also adopted the principle of foreign attachment under which action could be taken to recover costs from debtors of defendants. This was particularly useful where defendants had no recoverable property within the court's jurisdiction and was described by the 1830 prothonotary as a great advantage to citizens of the town. In cases where the defendant had no property in the court's jurisdiction they, if present, could be detained ahead of trial.  Post-1835 reform  The court was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The city's sheriff was designated as the presiding officer of the court, though he took no part in the proceedings. The city recorder became the judge of the court and the prothonotary was renamed the registrar. It was common after this time for juries to be used by the court, unusual in civil trials in England and Wales, though this was limited by the Juries Act 1918. The court survived in use well into the 20th-century perhaps because of the usefulness of the law merchant and foreign attachment procedures. During the 1960s the court saw a surge in popularity as its court fees were lower than those charged in the High Court or County Court; in the first half of 1962 some 275 actions were commenced in the Tolzey Court. Around this time it became a popular court for landlords' cases, though this ceased when the Protection from Eviction Act 1964 limited repossession actions to the County Court. The Tolzey Court was abolished by the Courts Act 1971 and its last hearing took place on 3 December 1971, a claim for repairs to the roof of a house, and was presided over by Recorder Joseph Malony. Many of the court records are held in the Bristol Record Office.

One of several rebellions which occurred in Henan due to the catastrophic Great Leap Forward implemented by the Chinese government, it lasted for twenty days in February 1959 and was one of the largest rural rebellions in China during the 1950s.  Background  Central China has a long history of both peasant uprisings as well as secret societies. In the 1920s and 1930s uprisings took place in Hubei, Sichuan, Henan, and Guizhou, during which peasant rebels organized as part of a large, decentralized Spirit Soldier movement that taught its members that they could invulnerable by undergoing secret rituals. From 1958, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Chairman Mao Zedong launched the Great Leap Forward causing a great crisis in many rural areas of China. The Great Chinese Famine erupted, killing millions, while the starving peasants were not allowed to leave their villages and fields. Despite the catastrophic conditions, people opposed to the Communist policies generally struggled to organize any proper opposition, as the Communist government maintained a strong hold on the country and suppressed most grassroots challenges. Regardless, desperate peasants began to organize low-level resistance. In many cases \\"redemptive societies\\" were involved; these were often secret societies or salvationist religions. Some of these groups went beyond spiritual and passive resistance, and actually attempted uprisings. While numerous resistance groups and rebellions broke out, most of these remained small in scale.  Rebellion  Armed resistance in Henan began in 1959 with cases of banditry, as members of the militia deserted, stole weapons, set up roadblocks and tried to intercept food transports. According to researcher S.A. Smith, the Spirit Soldier rebellion of 1959 was one of the few open rebellions that were \\"by no means trivial\\". A secret society known as \\"Regiment of Spirit Soldiers\\" (Shenbingtuan) initially gathered about 1,200 followers from several Chinese provinces such as Hubei, Sichuan, and Shaanxi. This substantial force then moved into Henan, where it attacked government offices in Sizhuang County on 2 February 1959. Chinese security forces needed twenty days to put down the uprising.  Aftermath  Unrest continued in central China and other regions during 1959 and 1960, but never came close to threatening the power of the Chinese Communist Party.

It is located at the tip of the Padr√£o, now the Point of Santo Ant√¥nio, to the extreme south of Salvador, at the entrance of the Bay of All Saints. The lighthouse was built at the center of the Santo Ant√¥nio da Barra Fort. The current lighthouse is the second built the site. The first was build of taipa, and was the second built in the Americas, after the old Friborg Palace in Recife. The current structure was built in 1839 and dedicated by Dom Pedro II of Brazil. It is constructed of masonry and painted with black and white bands. The lighthouse is a -high tapered tower with a Fresnal lens dating to 1890. The fort and lighthouse were listed as historic structures by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1938. First lighthouse The first lighthouse at Barra was built due to the expansion of commerce and slavery in Bahia in the 17th century. The port at Salvador was the principal point of the Atlantic slave trade in Brazil. The region, in turn, exported sugar, cotton, tobacco, and timber to the European consumer market. Gale√£o Sant√≠ssimo Sacramento suffered a tragic shipwreck on May 5, 1668 on the sand bank at the mouth of the Vermelho River due to a lack of a lighthouse in the area. The Fort of Santo Ant√¥nio da Barra, which had been rebuilt in 1696 under the government of Jo√£o de Lencastre (1694-1702), built a quadrangular turret in the fort topped by a glazed bronze lantern. The square shape of the lighthouse, in contrast to the cylindrical structure of today, is seen in Cartas Soteropolitanas in the late 18th century by Lu√≠s dos Santos Vilhena. It was powered by whale oil, and came to be called Vigia da Barra or Farol da Barra. The logbook of the English privateer William Dampier, in 1699, record: \\"The entrance to the Todos os Santos Bay is defended by the imposing Fort of Santo Ant√¥nio, whose lamps are lit and suspended to guide the ships, which we saw at night.\\" Second lighthouse Barra Lighthouse, 1922 After the exit of the Portuguese from Brazil regulatory Decree of July 6, 1832 mandated the installation of a more modern lighthouse at Barra. The government ordered a lighthouse manufactured in England to replace the old one. It was dedicated by Dom Pedro II on December 2, 1839. It had a catoptric reflector, lighted by kerosene, and was visible for eighteen nautical miles in clear weather. The old \\"Barbier\\" kerosene incandescent lighting system was replaced by electric light in 1937. The lighthouse, like others in Brazil, is owned by the Brazilian Navy. It is maintained by the Signaling Boating Center \\"Almirante Moraes R√™go\\" (Centro de Aux√≠lios √† Navega√ß√£o Almirante Moraes Rego) (CAMR) of the Hydrography and Navigation Directorate (Diretoria de Hidrografia e Navegac√£o) (DHN). The Barra Lighthouse is a visual icon of Salvador and references to it appear in literature, art, and film. Protected status The Santo Ant√¥nio da Barra Fort and the Barra Lighthouse are protected as a historic structures by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage. The fort was listed as a historic structure in 1938. Access The Barra Lighthouse, unlike others in Brazil, is open to the public and may be visited.

Second Columbia pilot boat In May 17, 1894, a new, bigger 95-feet pilot-boat Columbia, was launched from the Ambrose A. Martin's East Boston Massachusetts shipyard. She was built for pilot service for Captain Thomas Cooper and his colleagues, to replace the pilot-boat Friend, No. 7. They wanted a more up-to-date vessel to challenge the Hesper, Varuna, and other faster boats of the Boston fleet. She was registered as Number 2, for the Boston Pilots under command of Captain Cooper. After her launch she was towed to Battery Wharf, where she took on ballast. She was rigged by Francis Lowe & Sons. After being in service for only three months, the Columbia, was struck by the John B. Manning, of New York, a four-masted schooner on September 26, 1894. The schooner struck the Columbia on the port bow. She was damaged but made it back into port at East Boston. Captain Thomas Cooper was the pilot on the Columbia.

On November 26, 1898, while returning to Boston, the Columbia, was driven ashore at the notorious Sand Hills beach in Scituate in the great Portland Gale with the loss of all five men aboard. She was designed for rough weather and was only four years old. Other vessels were wrecked and homes were smashed in the winter storm. The giant seas tossed the Columbia on a seaside cottage. She remained on the beach at Sand Hills for over thirty years as a marine curiosity. For two days, patrolmen of the North Scituate Station picked their way through the wreckage during a snowstorm. Captain Cooper, who was not onboard the Columbia, was transferred to the pilot-boat Varuna, No. 6, that he had ownership with. The Louise No. 2 replaced the ill-fated Columbia. Pilot Boat Friend The Boston pilot boat Friend No. 7 was built in 1843. One of the captains was Captain Thomas Cooper, who sold the Friend to the New York Pilots on October 21, 1893, when she was 40 years old. On May 15, 1893, pilot-boat Friend with pilot Joe Fossett, picked up the two-masted schooner Modesty of Bangor, Maine, that was full of water. They were ble to bring the vessel into the East Boston with the help of the tugboat Piscataqua. In 1894, the pilot- boat Friend was replaced by the pilot-boat Columbia, built by Ambrose D. Martin at East Boston for Thomas Cooper. In November, 1896, the pilot-boat Friend was altered to be a pleasure boat. See also *List of Northeastern U. S.

In 2008, it ranked #1 on the bestseller list by Spiegel for 16 weeks. In April 2011, the English translation named Who am I ‚Äì and if so, how many? was released. The subject of Precht's investigation, which is aimed at general understanding, is the discussion of fundamental philosophical questions about human consciousness and behavior, taking into account more recent psychological and neurobiological findings. The declared aim of the book is to awaken and train the desire to think and to encourage progressive self-knowledge and a more consciously led life.  Content  The book is divided into three main questions, following Immanuel Kant, under which a total of 34 chapters are elaborated: *Was kann ich wissen? (What can I know?) which is dealt with in nine chapters. *Was soll ich tun? (What should I do?) which is dealt with in 16 chapters. *Was darf ich hoffen (What can I hope for?) which again is dealt with in nine chapters.

The first game in the series to be published in the series was NASCAR Heat Evolution, and the latest game to be released in the series was NASCAR Heat 5. History In May 2016, Monster Games announced the first NASCAR video game to be released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The working title was NASCAR Heat Evolution, and Dusenberry Martin Racing was named a co- developer. DMR had previously acquired a NASCAR license in January 2015. Released in September, the game received lackluster reviews for not including enough features. A sequel, NASCAR Heat 2, was released on September 12, 2017, and included the Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series in addition to the Cup Series, which NHE exclusively featured. NASCAR Heat 3 was released on September 7, 2018, and featured the fictional Xtreme Dirt Tour. On September 14, 2019, NASCAR Heat 4 was released. For NASCAR Heat 5, 704Games replaced Monster as developer and brought on Motorsport Games as publisher. The game was released in early July, a departure from the traditional September date; as an effect, the developers focused on smaller improvements. A standalone mobile game, NASCAR Heat Mobile, was released on April 25, 2017. Gameplay Heat has been criticized throughout its run for having little and low-quality presentation. The games feature playable challenges that unlock driver tutorials, and a single-player test mode was added for Heat 5. =Physics= Heat games feature a controller vibration when drafting. They also dynamic artificial intelligence. The game features a default automatic transmission, criticized for not carrying enough momentum. The game has been described as a mix of arcade and simulation. Between Heat 3 and Heat 4, the developers redid physics at a number of tracks, and also revamped the game's artificial intelligence. =Multiplayer= The series started with a bare-bones multiplayer option. Beginning with Heat 3, the eNASCAR Heat Pro League was sanctioned on the console, although NH3's online package was still criticized by reviewers. =Career= Heat games allow players to create a custom character in Career mode. Heat Evolution was criticized for having little to no plotline in Career mode, but did allow users to improve their car through a series of upgrades. Heat 2 introduced a new \\"Hot Seat\\" feature where players started in a part-time season before progressing to full-time. In Heat 3, players could own their own team in any series.

She also ran a popular correspondence column for the magazine Familie Journalen. In addition to fiction, she was the editor of Den gyldne bog om danske kvinder (1941), a collection of biographies of notable Danish women. She is remembered in particular for the three memoir portraits she wrote towards the end of her life: Der var engang, Paa Togt i Erindringen, and Paa Rejse i Livet. Early life and family Born on 23 February 1879 in Copenhagen, Edith Nebelong was the daughter of the court physician Carl Henrik Horn Nebelong (1844‚Äì1904) and Harriet Kiellerup (1858‚Äì1935). The eldest of three daughters, she was brought up in a well-to-do liberal home by an academic, librally-minded father and a rather conservative mother. Together with her sisters, she attended Vemmetofte Jomfrukloster School, although she later reported she had never learnt anything there. Hoping to escape from a home where her relationship with her mother was increasingly difficult, in April 1902 she married the painter Fritz Julius August Magnussen. They went to Italy on an extended honeymoon where her husband painted with the Nordic artists in Florence while she wrote novels. While there, she met and fell in love with the journalist and critic Helge Rode (1870‚Äì1937) who was nine years her senior. They eloped to Capri and married in September April 1905 after she had obtained a divorce from Magnussen. They had four children, Asta (born in Capri in 1903), Gregers (1906), Mikal (1908) and Ebbe (1910), who became an actor. Career Edith had embarked on her literary career while in her early twenties, publishing Misse Wichmann and Maja Engell in 1901. Both revealed how women's sensual desires were subdued by men unable to cope with the freedom and independence sought by women. They were both successful, receiving fairly positive reviews. After her second marriage, she was forced into writing even more profusely as her husband's income proved to be inadequate. In addition to writing novels, from 1913 she worked as a journalist for the newspaper Berlingske Tidende for the next 30 years, contributing articles about fires and dances rather than hard news. In 1937, she started the highly popular correspondence column in Familie Journalen which she ran for the rest of her life. Throughout her literary career she was highly productive, publishing some 40 books during her lifetime, not just novels and short stories but also poetry, short travel guides, memoirs and cookbooks. Her earlier works were published under her maiden name Edith Nebelong and one under her pen name Anatole Mille. She was editor-in-chief of the collection of biographies of notable Danish women, Den gyldne bog om danske kvinder, published in 1941. Several of her most memorable works appeared in her later life. In 1943, the collection of short stories De tre smaa piger is inspired by her own childhood while Der var engang (1951), P√• togt i erindringen (1953) and P√• rejse i livet, published pothsumately in 1957, represent her memoirs. Edith Rode died in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen on 3 September 1956 and is buried in Frederiksberg √Üldre Kirkeg√•rd.

It is the longest-running annual meal event in the world, having been held since 1545. It is generally hosted by three \\"Schaffers\\", who organise and pay for the banquet. Shaffermahlzeit has been held in the Bremen Town Hall since 1952, and hosts 200 seafaring workers and 100 public figures each year. The figures are invited on the condition that they will donate to the town's foundation. Women have been traditionally excluded from the meal, which led to criticism until the convention was abandoned in 2019.  History  As it is always held on the second Friday in February, the meal was originally held as a farewell for sailors embarking in the Spring. The Bremen council gave permission to the Sailor's guild to hold the event and collect donations from the public in 1545.Hermann Gutmann: Haus Seefahrt in Bremen und seine Schaffermahlzeit. Bremen 1999, S. 26. For many years, a banquet took place in the foundation members' own homes, initially in the house acquired in 1561 in the Hutfilterstrasse, now part of the Altstadt district of Bremen, and from 1663 on the same street in a new building constructed by the foundation. This meal was called the Schaffermahlzeit from around 1660. Later, every two years, from 1855, three Bremen merchants were chosen as new members of the board, who had the responsibility of organising and paying for the event.  Today  = 2020 Protest = On February 14, 2020, environment protesters from the Fridays For Future, Ende Gel√§nde and BUND demonstrated outside the Schaffermahlzeit. The protesters were directing their pleas towards the many government officials attending, particularly Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, Peter Altmaier. Local law enforcement procured an entrance for the displaced attendees, and during the meal Altmaier expressed his approval of expanding Bremen's climate policy with Wind power.

The teenager, referred to as Grace to conceal her identity, had been on probation for previous charges for theft and assault at the time of sentencing. Advocates and her defense team argued that she was not receiving the accommodations required by her IEP for her ADHD after her classes moved online due to coronavirus. Advocates also called the ruling evidence of systemic racism in the county's juvenile justice system. Protests, an online petition, and public officials advocating for her release followed after a July 2020 Propublica article went viral under the hashtag #FreeGrace. The Michigan Court of Appeals granted her request for release in July 2020, after 78 days of incarceration.  Background  At the time of her incarceration Grace was a Black, 15-year-old sophomore at Grove High School in Beverly Hills, Michigan. According to Charisse, her mother, Grace is an active student and has many strong friendships. Grace and Charisse were referred to by their middle names in the press coverage to conceal their identities. Her mother raised Grace alone and they maintained a close relationship that was sometimes volatile. In 2018, Grace entered a court diversion program for incorrigibility due to previously yelling at and hitting her mother. In late 2019, Grace was charged with hitting her mother and soon after was charged with larceny for stealing another student's cellphone from a locker. She had no further police contact after those two incidents. Her in-person classes at Grove High School moved online in April for social distancing requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Grace stated in an interview for ProPublica that she was overwhelmed by online learning, and her ADHD diagnosis made her easily distracted. Charisse stated that the terms of Grace's IEP were not fulfilled when classes moved online. At Grace's April 21 juvenile court hearing for the theft and assault charges, her case worker recommended that Grace be incarcerated at a residential facility for mental health and anger management treatment. The presiding Judge Mary Ellen Brennan of Oakland County Family Court Division instead sentenced her to \\"intensive probation\\", which included the use of a GPS tether and regular check-ins with a caseworker. One week later, her caseworker reported her to the court for a parole violation because Charisse said that Grace had gone back to bed after their last check- in. The caseworker then checked in with Grace's teacher, who said she had failed to turn in an assignment. The teacher later stated that she did not think Grace's performance was out of step with the other students.  Arrest  At a May court date Judge Brennan ruled that Grace had violated probation and found her \\"guilty on failure to submit to any schoolwork and getting up for school.‚Äù She sentenced Grace to be incarcerated at Children's Village juvenile detention center. The judge called Grace a threat to the community and stated that she had \\"not fulfilled the expectation with regard to school performance.\\" Grace's caseworker testified that she was unaware of Grace's learning disability or any accommodations that she was entitled to. Grace was incarcerated in mid-May. Grace and her mother requested that she be returned home at an early June court status hearing. Instead, Judge Brennan reaffirmed that Grace should continue to be incarcerated to get needed mental health services. The judge set a September 8 case review date, and Grace was transferred to a residential mental health facility.  Aftermath  = Criticism = Experts stated that the ruling was not in line with guidance around disciplinary responses amid the upheaval brought upon students by COVID-19. State disability watchdogs and juvenile justice advocates gave the opinion that the punishment was too harsh for having missed a homework assignment given the pandemic and the difficult time that most students had adjusting. They further stated that the ruling was a reflection of systemic racism in the judicial system and other over-criminalization of Black youth. Grace is a Black teenage girl in a predominantly white school district with racial disparities in juvenile justice outcomes. = Public response = The story was publicly released by Jodi S. Cohen in a July 14, 2020 ProPublica article. After its publication the story went viral under the hashtag #FreeGrace on Twitter, and a Change.org petition circulated that over 250,000 signed demanding Grace's release. Members of Congress, ACLU Michigan, and Oakland County officials and legislators also echoed calls for her release. Officials from her school district also released a statement that argued students should not be punished for failure to turn in homework in light of the pandemic. There was a car caravan protest and a protest outside of Grace's school requesting her release; Black Lives Matter signs were among those displayed at the protest. On July 16, 2020, criminal justice reform organization Michigan Liberation hosted a rally of support for Grace outside of the Oakland County Circuit Courthouse, which drew approximately 200 people. Speakers denounced the prosecutor for bringing the charges. The day before her release, several members of Congress requested the intervention of Attorney General William Barr and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.  Release  At a July 20, 2020 hearing Grace again requested to return home. Judge Brennan denied the motion to release her and stated \\"if I were to grant the request to release you home today, I would be making a mistake, and I would be doing you a disservice.\\" Grace was ordered to be set free by the Michigan Court of Appeals on July 31, 78 days after her initial incarceration. She was released the same day. When Grace was released, she was still on probation. The prosecutor's office submitted a statement of support for the ruling. Grace and her mother released a statement, thanking supporters.

He primarily served in the regional government of Jakarta, reaching the rank of regional secretary in 2014. He had previously served as appointed mayor of Central Jakarta between 2010 and 2014, following a seven-year career in Jakarta's educational offices. He died in 2020 due to COVID-19. Early life and education Saefullah was born on 11 February 1964 in Cilincing, North Jakarta, in the administrative village (kelurahan) of Rorotan. He studied in Bekasi for his elementary school, and in Jakarta's public schools for middle and high school. He studied at a teachers' school instead of a regular high school. He later studied and obtained degrees from Muhammadiyah Teachers' Institute (1988), Jakarta State University (2000), and Padjadjaran University (2009). Career After graduating from teachers' school in 1982, Saefullah began teaching as a semi-permanent honorary teacher until 1984, when he became a formal civil servant as an elementary teacher in Manggarai, Central Jakarta. He became headmaster after eight years of teaching and superintendent after another six years. He was promoted to head of the education office in West Jakarta in 2003. By 2004, he was head for middle school education for the whole of Jakarta, and was further promoted to head of the youth and sports office for Jakarta in 2009. Saefullah was appointed as mayor of Central Jakarta on 4 November 2010. During this tenure, he worked on relocating street vendors from Tanah Abang and Monas, and was also appointed as commissioner to Persija Jakarta in 2013 while the football club was experiencing a financial crisis and player strikes. On 11 July 2014, then- acting governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama appointed Saefullah into the post of Jakarta's regional secretary, the highest-ranked bureaucratic office in the provincial government. The position had been nominally vacant at that time since April 2013 due to the resignation of the previous holder. Saefullah had previously participated in a competency test for the position. According to Basuki, while another bureaucrat Sylviana Murni had placed higher in the competency test, Saefullah was appointed due to his younger age. In March 2016, Saefullah had been elected as chairman for the Jakarta branch of Nahdlatul Ulama. He stated his intention to run for the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election and received an endorsement from the National Awakening Party, though he did not end up running. He very briefly served as acting governor of Jakarta between the end of Djarot Saiful Hidayat's term on 15 October 2017 and the start of Anies Baswedan's term the following day; he referred to the length of his tenure as 40 hours (24 hours on 15 October, and 16 hours on 16 October). His five-year appointment as regional secretary, which would have expired in October 2019, was extended by Baswedan in July 2019. He was proposed by Gerindra in November 2019 as a potential vice governor to replace Sandiaga Uno, though the office went to Ahmad Riza Patria. Death Saefullah, alongside West Jakarta mayor Uus Kuswanto, were confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19 on 13 September 2020. He had previously been admitted to a hospital since as early as 8 September due to stomach problems. He died at noon on 16 September 2020, due to COVID-19-induced septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome. On the same day as his death, he was buried at his family's grave in Cilincing, with grave workers wearing biohazard outfits according to safety protocols.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MLB expanded the postseason instead of holding the regular Wild Card Game for each league. All games for each series were played at the higher seeded team's home ballpark. The matchups were: * (1) Los Angeles Dodgers (West Division champions) vs. (8) Milwaukee Brewers (Second Wild Card) * (2) Atlanta Braves (East Division champions) vs. (7) Cincinnati Reds (First Wild Card) * (3) Chicago Cubs (Central Division champions) vs. (6) Miami Marlins (East Division 2nd place) * (4) San Diego Padres (West Division 2nd place) vs. (5) St. Louis Cardinals (Central Division 2nd place) Because of the expanded postseason format, the National League Central became the first division in MLB history to have four teams qualify for the postseason in the same year. However, none of the four teams played each other, and all four ended up losing their respective Wild Card Series, with each team losing its elimination game via a shutout. Background On September 15, 2020, MLB announced the playoff bracket for the 2020 season, which was shortened to 60 regular season games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The postseason will consist of eight teams from each league: The top two teams from each division, plus the teams from each league with the next two best records. The Wild Card Series will be a best-of- three series, as opposed to the play-in game format of the Wild Card Game from previous seasons, while the Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series will be their normal lengths. The Wild Card Series games will be played at the home field of the higher seeded team.

Those matchups were: * (1) Tampa Bay Rays (East Division champions) vs. (5) New York Yankees (East Division 2nd place) * (2) Oakland Athletics (West Division champions) vs. (6) Houston Astros (West Division 2nd place) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all games for each of the two series were held at two neutral sites at Petco Park in San Diego, California, and Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The games were televised nationally by TBS. The Yankees‚Äô loss to the Rays was also the first time that a losing team outscored the winning team, the line score was 24-21 in favor of the Yankees. The Rays would earn their second ALCS berth, their first being in 2008. Background Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MLB season was reduced to 60 games. As part of a special postseason format, playoff berths were made available for eight teams in each league: three division winners, three division runners-up, and two wild card teams. With no first round byes for division winners, all teams were required to play in a Wild Card series. Between the two leagues, Central division teams claimed three of the four wild card berths and thus made up seven of the sixteen teams in the Wild Card. However, all seven Central division teams lost their Wild Card series, thus leaving the Division series in both leagues to be contested exclusively by teams from East and West divisions. The Rays entered the ALDS as the top seed, having completed the regular season at and winning the AL East. The second-seeded Athletics won the AL West, going . The two second place teams in their respective divisions, the Yankees and the Astros, also made the ALDS. Since 2012, when MLB removed the stipulation that two teams could not play each other in the ALDS if they were of the same division, there have been three times when an ALDS had at least one series with two division opponents. This is not only the fourth time that this will occur, but it is also the first time since the strike-affected 1981 American League Division Series (where division opponents were assured of facing each other on a one- time basis) that both ALDS match-ups consist of division opponents facing each other. This was the sixth ALDS for the Rays (having made it previously last year) and 22nd for the Yankees (and fourth in a row); they had faced each other ten times in the regular season, with the Rays winning eight out of ten games. This was the ninth ALDS for the Athletics (first since 2013) and the fifth for the Astros (their 12th Division Series overall, making their fourth in a row); in ten games between the two teams, the Athletics won seven games. As part of the terms set for the postseason, all games starting with the Division Series would be played at neutral sites. The Rays and Yankees played at Petco Park, while the Astros and Athletics played at Dodger Stadium. The higher seed served as the \\"home team\\" (i.e., batted second each inning) for Games 1, 2, and 5, while the lower seed was the \\"home team\\" for Games 3 and 4, mirroring the 2‚Äì2‚Äì1 format typically used in the Division Series. Matchups =Tampa Bay Rays vs. New York Yankees= This is the first postseason meeting between the Yankees and the Rays. =Oakland Athletics vs. Houston Astros= This is the first postseason meeting between the Athletics and Astros. Tampa Bay vs. New York This is the first postseason match-up between the Rays and Yankees. The Rays won eight of ten games against the Yankees during the 60-game regular season. =Game 1= Gerrit Cole struck out eight batters over six innings and was credited with the win in Game 1 DJ LeMahieu began the game with a single off Rays starter Blake Snell, and came around to score following a wild pitch, a groundout, and a sacrificy fly. In the bottom of the first, Randy Arozarena tied the game with a solo home run off Yankees starter Gerrit Cole. Clint Frazier broke the tie with a home run in the top of the third, but the Rays promptly took a 3‚Äì2 lead with a two-run Ji-Man Choi home run. The Yankees regained the lead with solo home runs by Kyle Higashioka and Aaron Judge in the top of the fifth, which proved to be Snell's last inning. Ryan Thompson and Oliver Drake pitched scoreless sixth, seventh, and eighth innings, as did Cole, Chad Green, and Zack Britton. John Curtiss struggled in the ninth inning for the Rays, giving up an RBI single to Hicks before loading the bases for Giancarlo Stanton, who hit a grand slam to extend the Yankees' lead to 9‚Äì3. Shane McClanahan entered to pitch for the Rays afterwards, becoming the first pitcher in MLB history to debut in the postseason. Luis Cessa pitched a scoreless bottom of the ninth to end the game. =Game 2= Winning pitcher Tyler Glasnow struck out ten batters over five innings in Game 2 The Rays took an early lead on a solo Randy Arozarena home run off starter Deivi Garc√≠a in the bottom of the first, but Giancarlo Stanton tied the game with a solo home run off Rays starter Tyler Glasnow to lead off the top of the second. J. A. Happ replaced Garc√≠a after the first inning; in the bottom of the second, Joey Wendle singled and Mike Zunino homered to give the Rays a 3‚Äì1 lead. Manuel Margot hit another two-run homer off Happ in the third following a walk to Ji-Man Choi. Glasnow began the fourth by allowing a single to Aaron Hicks and walking Luke Voit, which was followed by another Stanton home run, cutting the score to 5‚Äì4. Happ was replaced by Adam Ottavino in the fourth; in the fifth, Ottavino walked Wendle, who prompty stole second. Jonathan Lo√°isiga then entered to pitch to Kevin Kiermaier, who scored Wendle with a single. Austin Meadows extended the lead to 7‚Äì4 with a home run off Lo√°isiga in the sixth. Scoreless innings were pitched by the Rays' Diego Castillo and Nick Anderson and the Yankees' Jonathan Holder and Nick Nelson. Pete Fairbanks entered to finish the game for the Rays in the ninth, and ran into trouble after issuing walks to Urshela and Gleyber Torres. He was able to strike out Clint Frazier and Gary S√°nchez, but DJ LeMahieu singled to drive in a run. Fairbanks was able to retire Aaron Judge with a groundout to limit the damage and seal the victory for Tampa Bay. The Rays' pitchers struck out 18 Yankees batters, a record for a nine-inning postseason game. Giancarlo Stanton joined Lou Gehrig and Reggie Jackson as the only Yankees with home runs in four straight postseason games. =Game 3= Kevin Kiermaier hit a go-ahead 3-run home run in the top of the fourth in Game 3 Michael P√©rez began the scoring with an RBI single in the top of the second off Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka. The Rays started Charlie Morton, who pitched two 1-2-3 innings to begin the game, but, in the third, Brett Gardner singled, Kyle Higashioka reached on a Willy Adames error, and DJ LeMahieu walked to load the bases. Aaron Judge scored Gardner on a sacrifice fly, but Morton got Luke Voit to ground out to end the inning. In the fourth, Kevin Kiermaier homered after Joey Wendle singled and Adames walked to give the Rays a 4‚Äì1 lead, and Randy Arozarena added a run with a solo home run in the fifth, which ended Tanaka's outing. Morton allowed a run in the bottom of the fifth after LeMahieu singled and Aaron Hicks scored him with a double, but P√©rez hit a two-run home run off Chad Green in the sixth to extend the Rays' lead again. Luis Cessa replaced Green after the home run, and walked Arozarena, who scored on a Ji-man Choi double, giving the Rays an 8‚Äì2 lead. Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run home run off Shane McClanahan in the eighth after Voit reached on an error, but Diego Castillo pitched a scoreless ninth to end the game at 8‚Äì4 for Tampa Bay. =Game 4= Chad Green pitched two perfect innings and earned the win in Game 4 In Game 4, the Rays started Ryan Thompson as an opener. In the second, Thompson gave up a leadoff home run to Luke Voit and promptly loaded the bases with three straight walks to Brett Gardner, Gleyber Torres and Gio Urshela. Thompson was able to strike out Kyle Higashioka, but Aaron Judge delivered a sacrifice fly to give the Yankees a 2‚Äì0 lead. Yankees starter Jordan Montgomery allowed the Rays' sole run of the game in the third when Willy Adames walked, Kevin Kiermaier hit a ground-rule double, and Brandon Lowe grounded out to score Adames. Ryan Yarbrough pitched for the Rays after Thompson, and allowed one run, a solo home run to Torres. The Yankees scored another run in the eighth inning off Aaron Slegers after Torres singled and stole second and was driven in by a Higashioka single. Chad Green, Zack Britton, and Aroldis Chapman all pitched scoreless innings in relief of Montgomery to force a Game 5. =Game 5= In the decisive Game 5, the Yankees turned to Gerrit Cole, while the Rays started Tyler Glasnow. As Glasnow had thrown 93 pitches in the Rays' victory in Game 2, he was not expected to pitch for long. Glasnow pitched into the third, when Nick Anderson entered in relief. Aaron Judge homered off Anderson to lead off the fourth, giving the Yankees a 1‚Äì0. Cole, meanwhile, took a no-hitter into the fifth inning until Austin Meadows tied the game with a home run of his own. Pete Fairbanks pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth for Tampa Bay, while Zack Britton relieved Cole in the sixth and earned two outs in the seventh before the Yankees went to their closer, Aroldis Chapman, to keep the game tied. After Diego Castillo retired the Yankees in the top of the eighth, Mike Brosseau gave the Rays the lead with a home run off Chapman, a matchup that was seen as significant as Chapman had been previously suspended for throwing at Brosseau's head in September. Castillo pitched a scoreless top of the ninth to send the Rays to their first ALCS since 2008. =Composite line score= 2020 ALDS (3‚Äì2): Tampa Bay Rays defeated New York Yankees Oakland vs. Houston This is the first postseason match-up between the Athletics and Astros. The Athletics won seven of ten games against the Astros during the 60-game regular season. This is the first time that two AL West teams have met in a postseason match-up in the wild card era. =Game 1= In Game 1, Oakland struck first on a home run by Khris Davis. They would follow with another home run to lead off the third inning from Sean Murphy to give them a 3‚Äì0 lead. They had a chance for more with consecutive singles before a double play wiped their chance out. In the next inning, the Astros struck back with home runs from Alex Bregman and Carlos Correa to tie the game at three. Oakland responded in kind with the first batter in Matt Olson to take the lead back. In the fifth, both starting pitchers would be taken out before getting an out, with Chris Bassitt having allowed three runs on nine hits while Lance McCullers Jr allowed five runs (four earned) on eight hits. The Athletics led 5‚Äì3 after five innings, but the Astros took over from there in through an awakened offense to override a previously vaunted bullpen. In the sixth inning, the Astros generated four runs after having led the inning off with two outs, doing so on an error, three singles, and a double. The Astros bullpen came through for them with the work of four pitchers that allowed no hits/runs, with Blake Taylor receiving the win for his pivotal fifth inning. As for the Athletics, they went through seven pitchers to pitch in relief, who combined for seven hits and seven runs while J.B. Wendelken received the loss for his work in the fifth. The game was full of distinct firsts, such as George Springer having his first four hit postseason game, while Correa became the first shortstop (and first Astro) to have multiple career multi-homer postseason games. https://www.mlb.com/astros/news/carlos-correa-two-home-runs-alds- game-1https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK202010050.shtmlhttps://www.mlb.com/news/astros-win- alds-game-1-2020 =Game 2= Once again, the Athletics took the lead early, doing so on a home run from Khris Davis off Framber Valdez. However, the Astros would respond in the next inning with a two-out home run by George Springer to make it 2‚Äì1. In the next inning, the Astros generated a run on a double, a single, and a groundout from Carlos Correa to make it 3‚Äì1. The Athletics responded with their first batter in the fourth by Chad Pinder's home run shot to make it 3‚Äì2. Sean Manaea would be pulled after two batters in the fifth inning after Martin Maldonado hit a home run. On Yusmeiro Petit's first pitch as reliever, George Springer hit a deep shot to left field to make it 5‚Äì2. Valdez would pitch until the seventh inning, finishing with ten retired batters in a row (with reliever Enoli Paredes retiring the first three batters as well). Ryan Pressly allowed a single in the ninth inning, but he followed it up with a flyball and a double play to finish another game of work for the Astros, who won their fourth straight postseason game. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK202010060.shtml =Game 3= The third game was more of the same in pitching and leads in a relative sense, since both starting pitchers in Jesus Luzardo and Jose Urquidy did not make it to the fifth inning, and the Athletics and the Astros would trade the lead separate times. Tommy La Stella started it off early for the Athletics, doing so on the seventh pitch of the game to give them a 1‚Äì0 lead. The Astros responded in kind with a home run by Jose Altuve (his first since the famed shot in the ALCS the previous year), while Carlos Correa drove in a run with a fielder's choice that scored Michael Brantley to make it 2‚Äì1. Mark Canha absolved them of the lead four pitches later on a home run. Matt Olson gave them the lead on the first pitch of the fourth inning, and a home run from Marcus Semien in the subsequent inning chased Urquidy from the game as the Athletics led 4‚Äì2. The bottom half of the frame saw three pitchers for the Athletics, as a home run from Aledmys Diaz after a lead-off walk tied the game, while Michael Brantley and Alex Bregman each scored in a run on base hits off Yusmeiro Petit before Jake Diekman finished the inning with allowing an RBI single and the final out of a now 7‚Äì4 game. In the seventh inning, the Athletics would tie the game, garnering two straight singles off Josh James before a Chad Pinder home run tied it at seven. Brooks Raley would get the three outs to close the inning (as James had done for the sixth), but his attempt at pitching a second inning of work resulted in two walks, a double, and two runs on sacrifice flyballs to make it 9‚Äì7. Liam Hendriks closed out the last three innings for the Athletics by allowing just one hit and no runs as they would force a Game 4 in the series. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU202010070.shtml =Game 4= In Game 4, the pattern of lead changes and home run balls flying would continue as both teams combined for six home runs to contribute to a new record of home runs in a Division Series with 24 (the previous record being 22 by the 1995 ALDS), with both teams hitting 12. One constant emerged from this game in a dearth of starting pitcher depth. In the second inning, Ramon Laureano started it off with a home run blast off Zack Greinke after consecutive singles to make it 3‚Äì0. In the fourth inning, Frankie Montas, like other starting Oakland pitchers before him, met his match. Jose Altuve led off the inning with a walk, and Michael Brantley responded with a home run to narrow the game to 3‚Äì2. Montas allowed two straight singles to bring up Carlos Correa. He hit a deep shot to left field to make it 5‚Äì3. Montas allowed two more singles before J.B. Wendelken was brought in to get the final out. Laureano responded in the fifth inning on the second pitch by Greinke to narrow it to 5‚Äì4, while Greinke lasted long enough to get two of the three outs before being taken out for the bullpen. The Astros continued the barrage with Brantley hitting his second home run, while two hits and walk resulted in one more run driven in by Correa to make it 7‚Äì4. In the sixth, they continued the scoring with hitting prowess, as Kyle Tucker and Correa each drove in RBIs on singles to make it 9‚Äì4. In the subsequent inning, Jose Altuve hit a home run off Jake Diekman to make the score 11‚Äì4. The bullpen for the Astros took over and held the fort together, allowing two runs on six hits as Cristian Javier led the way with 2 innings of work to receive the victory, with Khris Davis striking out with runners on second and first to finish off a 11‚Äì6 victory. The Athletics allowed six runs on seven hits in the finishing game in a series where they used all but one pitcher. The Astros clinched their way to the American League Championship Series for the fourth straight year, becoming the fifth team to ever reach four straight LCS and the first since the St. Louis Cardinals did so from 2011 to 2014. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU202010080.shtmlhttps://www.mlb.com/astros/news/zack- greinke-cristian-javier-astros-game-4-alds =Composite line score= 2020 ALDS (3‚Äì1): Houston Astros defeated Oakland Athletics See also *2020 National League Division Series References Further reading * * External links *Major League Baseball postseason schedule American League Division Series Category:American League Division Series Category:Houston Astros postseason Category:Oakland Athletics postseason Category:New York Yankees postseason Category:Tampa Bay Rays postseason Category:Baseball in Los Angeles Category:Baseball in San Diego American League Division Series Category:Sports competitions in Los Angeles Category:Sports competitions in San Diego American League Division Series American League Division Series American League Division Series American League Division Series ","title":"2020 American League Division Series"},{"id":"65331309","text":"The 2020 National League Division Series were two best-of-five-games series in Major League Baseball (MLB) to determine the participating teams in the 2020 National League Championship Series.

The games were televised nationally by FS1 and MLB Network. Both series ended in a sweep for the first time since 2007. Background Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MLB season was reduced to 60 games. As part of a special postseason format, playoff berths were made available for eight teams in each league: three division winners, three division runners-up, and two wild card teams. With no first round byes for division winners, all teams were required to play in a Wild Card series.

The two second place teams in their respective divisions, the Marlins and the Padres, also made the NLDS. Since 2012, when MLB removed the stipulation that two teams could not play each other in the NLDS if they were in the same division, there had been six occasions when an NLDS had at least one series with two division opponents.

Matchups =Los Angeles Dodgers vs. San Diego Padres= This was the first postseason meeting between the Dodgers and the Padres. =Atlanta Braves vs. Miami Marlins= This was the second postseason meeting between the Braves and the Marlins. The teams previously met in the 1997 National League Championship Series, which the Marlins won 4‚Äì2. Los Angeles vs. San Diego This was the first postseason match-up between the Dodgers and Padres. The Dodgers won six of ten games against the Padres during the 60-game regular season. This was the first postseason series to feature two California teams since the 2002 World Series. =Game 1= Mike Clevinger returned to the mound for the Padres but was pulled after one inning after a noticeable drop in velocity. The game remained scoreless until the fourth inning, when the Padres scored on a two-out hit from Austin Nola. San Diego enjoyed their lead briefly ‚Äì until the Dodgers scored on an error in the fifth. Then a game that had been well-pitched to that point boiled over in the sixth, when the Dodgers put up four runs to win by a 5‚Äì1 score. Just like Game 3 of their wild card win over the Cardinals, the Padres used nine pitchers and walked ten batters, along the way. =Game 2= Before the game, the Padres removed injured starter Mike Clevinger from the roster and replaced him with Dan Altavilla. The Padres took an early lead in the second inning when Wil Myers hit a double to center field that scored Tommy Pham. The Dodgers took the lead for good in the third inning on a two- run double by Corey Seager and a single by Max Muncy, and padded their lead the next inning on a Cody Bellinger home run. The Padres began the sixth inning with back-to-back home runs by Manny Machado and Eric Hosmer that reduced their deficit to one, but Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw retired the next three batters to end the inning. The Padres threatened again in the seventh inning, when Bellinger made a spectacular catch over the center-field wall that would otherwise have been a go-ahead two-run home run by Fernando Tat√≠s Jr. The Dodgers padded their lead in the bottom half of the seventh on a Justin Turner sacrifice fly and a single by Muncy. The Padres threatened in the top of the ninth inning, scoring two runs on hits by Mitch Moreland and Trent Grisham off Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen and once again reducing their deficit to a single run. Joe Kelly replaced Jansen with Grisham on first base and two outs, and walked Tat√≠s and Machado to load the bases before getting Hosmer to ground out to end the game. =Game 3= The Dodgers took an early lead in the second inning that was quickly erased when the Padres scored two runs in the bottom half of the inning. The Padres' lead was also short-lived, as the Dodgers scored five runs in the third inning en route to a blowout win. Though he did not start the game, erstwhile Dodgers starter Julio Ur√≠as pitched five innings in relief, allowing one run on one hit, striking out six Padres, and getting credited as the winning pitcher. The Padres, meanwhile, used 11 pitchers ‚Äì a postseason record for a nine-inning game. The Dodgers advanced to their fourth NLCS in five seasons. The Dodgers' Will Smith had five hits in the game, becoming the first catcher, the first player in Dodgers franchise history, and the ninth major league player ever to accomplish the feat in a postseason game.https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/1314430206346747904 =Composite line score= 2020 NLDS (3‚Äì0): Los Angeles Dodgers defeated San Diego Padres Atlanta vs. Miami This was the second postseason match-up between the Braves and the Marlins. Their previous postseason meeting was in the 1997 National League Championship Series, which the Marlins won in six games. The Braves won the season series 6‚Äì4 in ten meetings during the 60‚Äìgame regular season. =Game 1= Ronald Acu√±a Jr. led off the Braves‚Äô day with a opposite field home run (facing Sandy Alc√°ntara), setting the tone for his club. The Marlins would take the lead in the third off of a Garrett Cooper double that plated two runs and a Brian Anderson single that scored Cooper. After a pair of runs in the third to draw within one run, the Braves would break the game open in the seventh against a fatigued Alc√°ntara, Yimi Garc√≠a, and James Hoyt, via a Travis d'Arnaud three-run home run. The Braves‚Äô six-run seventh also featured a two-run shot from Dansby Swanson. Things turned testy in the third when Acu√±a was hit by a 98-mph fastball. The showy All-Star outfielder held onto his bat and walked a few steps toward the mound before umpires and Braves coaches surrounded him and directed him away from Alc√°ntara, who had started to walk toward him.

The Rays won the series and their second American League pennant after defeating the Astros, 4‚Äì3. In this series, the Astros became just the second team to force a Game 7 in MLB postseason history after trailing a best-of-seven series 3‚Äì0, after the 2004 Red Sox. Background Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MLB season was reduced to 60 games. As part of a special postseason format, playoff berths were made available for eight teams in each league: three division winners, three division runners-up, and two wild card teams. With no first-round byes for division winners, all teams were required to play in a Wild Card series. The Rays made their first ALCS appearance since 2008, where they defeated the Boston Red Sox in seven games. On September 23, the Rays clinched their third AL East division title and their first since 2010. They swept the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2020 American League Wild Card Series and beat the New York Yankees in the 2020 American League Division Series.

On September 30, the Astros became the first sub-.500 team to win a playoff series, eliminating the Minnesota Twins in a two-game sweep in the 2020 American League Wild Card Series after holding the typically potent Twins bats to zero home runs across the entire series. The Astros' win in Game 2 handed the Twins their 18th consecutive postseason loss, a drought dating back to 2004, and the longest such streak in all of North America's major professional sports. The Astros advanced to the ALDS where they defeated the Oakland Athletics in a four-game upset, scoring a historic 33 runs (and 12 home runs) across 35 innings, and advancing to their fourth straight ALCS. The Astros became the first team to participate in an LCS with a losing record. This was the Astros' eighth overall LCS appearance (four each in the NL and AL). This was the second postseason meeting between the Rays and Astros, a rematch of the 2019 ALDS, which Houston won, 3‚Äì2. As part of the terms set for the postseason, all games of the series were played at Petco Park in San Diego, California, a neutral site. This was the first ALCS to take place exclusively at a neutral site. Tampa Bay as the higher seed served as the home team (batting last each inning) for Games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while Houston as the lower seed was the home team for Games 3, 4, and 5, mirroring the 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 format typically used in the LCS. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Rays and Astros had not played each other during the regular season. Also due to the pandemic, the ALCS was played without fans in attendance.

The starting pitchers, Lance McCullers Jr. for Houston and Charlie Morton for Tampa Bay, had both pitched for Houston in Game 7 of the 2017 ALCS and Game 7 of the 2017 World Series. Tampa Bay became the first MLB team to advance after taking a 3‚Äì0 series lead and then be forced to play a Game 7. Concluding matters was Pete Fairbanks, who got Aledmys D√≠az to fly out to Manuel Margot, to end the Astros' season and win the second AL pennant for Tampa Bay, the first in 13 seasons. Fairbanks earned his second save this postseason.

The previous three match-ups were the 1996 National League Division Series, 2013 National League Division Series, and 2018 National League Division Series, with Atlanta winning the former and Los Angeles winning the latter two. Although considered regular-season games, the two teams also met in the 1959 National League tie-breaker series, with the Dodgers winning the series 2‚Äì0 to advance to the 1959 World Series. The Braves were formerly an NL West member for 24 years (1969‚Äì1993); the Braves and Dodgers finished in the top two positions in the division in , , and . The Braves and Dodgers were the World Champions of the two shortened MLB seasons prior to 2020; 1995 for Atlanta and 1981 for Los Angeles. The 2020 Dodgers started the season 30‚Äì10, matching their best 40-game start in franchise history. The last such Dodgers start came in 1977, along with the Brooklyn teams in 1888 and 1955. This was also the best 40-game start in the majors since the 116-win Mariners began 31‚Äì9 in 2001. The Dodgers finished the regular season , won their eighth straight division title, and swept both the Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres to get to the NLCS. This is the Dodgers' fourth appearance in the National League Championship Series in five seasons, fifth in eight seasons, and fourteenth overall. By virtue of their regular season record, the best in the league, the Dodgers are guaranteed to have ‚Äúhome-field‚Äù advantage throughout the entire postseason. For the Braves, 2020 marked their first NLCS appearance since 2001. Atlanta was highlighted by a league-leading offense led by Freddie Freeman, offseason free agent signee Marcell Ozuna, and Ronald Acu√±a Jr.. In their game against the Miami Marlins on September 9, the Braves scored 29 runs, one short of the MLB record set by the Texas Rangers in 2007.

The Braves led MLB in hits (556), doubles (130), runs batted in (338), on-base percentage (.349), on-base plus slugging (.832), total bases (1,001) and plate appearances (2,344). For the third consecutive year, the Dodgers led the National League in runs scored and fewest runs allowed. They also led MLB in home runs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dodgers and Braves did not play each other in the regular season. This was the first NLCS since 2010 that did not feature a team from the NL Central. This series was the first time all season that a limited number of spectators were allowed to attend the games. Summary Game summaries =Game 1= The game was a pitchers duel between Walker Buehler and Max Fried, both of whom allowed only one run on solo homers (Freddie Freeman for the Braves and Kik√© Hern√°ndez for the Dodgers). However the Dodgers bullpen gave up the game in the ninth inning with Blake Treinen allowing the go-ahead homer to Austin Riley and then Ozzie Albies hit a two- run homer off Jake McGee to put the game out of reach as the Braves won, 5‚Äì1. =Game 2= Clayton Kershaw was originally scheduled to start Game 2 but he was scratched due to back spasms. Rookie Tony Gonsolin started instead.https://www.mlb.com/news/clayton-kershaw-scratched-for-nlcs- game-2-start Freeman opened the scoring in the fourth with a two-run homer. With one out in the fifth, Gonsolin and Pedro Baez combined to allow four walks and two hits as Atlanta took a 6‚Äì0 lead. After Ian Anderson and Tyler Matzek started the game with six scoreless innings, the Dodgers came back against the Braves bullpen. Corey Seager hit a three-run homer in the seventh, making it 7‚Äì3. In the top of the ninth, a home run by Ozzie Albies added what turned out to be a crucial insurance run. The Dodgers staged a rally in the bottom of the ninth, thanks to a double by Seager, a homer by Max Muncy and a triple by Cody Bellinger. However, the Braves held on to win 8‚Äì7 to take a two games to none lead in the series. =Game 3= In Game 3, the Dodgers jumped on Braves starter Kyle Wright early, scoring 11 runs in the first inning with Edwin R√≠os hitting a solo homer, Joc Pederson a three-run homer and Max Muncy a grand slam. They added on with a Cody Bellinger home run in the second followed by a Corey Seager homer in the third. Julio Ur√≠as allowed only one run in his five innings of work, with five strikeouts. The 11 runs in the first inning set a new MLB record for the most runs ever scored by one team in any inning of a post-season game. The Dodgers won the game 15‚Äì3. =Game 4= Clayton Kershaw, who was originally scheduled to start Game 2, started for the Dodgers. For the Braves, rookie Bryse Wilson took the mound. Wilson was making only his eighth career start, and his first in the postseason. It was a pitchers' duel going into the sixth inning, with each starting pitcher giving up a solo home run (Wilson to Edwin R√≠os and Kershaw to Marcell Ozuna). For Wilson, the home run was the only hit he allowed in six innings of work. In the bottom of the sixth inning, the Braves broke the game open with six runs, and eleven batters coming to the plate. As a result of this 10‚Äì2 victory, the Braves were one victory away from the World Series. =Game 5= The Braves took a 2‚Äì0 lead after two innings off of Dustin May and the Braves' A. J. Minter struck out seven while allowing only one hit in three scoreless innings. A baserunning mistake cost the Braves a run in the bottom of the third inning when Marcell Ozuna was initially ruled to have scored after he safely touched home on a Dansby Swanson sacrifice fly to right that Mookie Betts caught near his feet in spectacular fashion; after an appeal play at third and an instant replay review, Ozuna was ruled out for failing to tag up (i.e, he did not retouch third base after Betts caught the ball) and the run was taken off the board on the inning-ending double play. The Dodgers got one back in the fourth on a solo homer by Corey Seager ‚Äì the first batter after the overturned call ‚Äì then took the lead in the sixth when Dodgers catcher Will Smith homered off Braves reliever Will Smith. This was the first matchup between two players of the same name in playoff history. Betts drove in a run with a single in the seventh, followed by a two-run homer by Seager, his second of the night. The Dodgers held on to win 7‚Äì3, to extend their season. =Game 6= In the sixth game of the series, the Dodgers got off to a strong start with three runs in the first off Max Fried, including solo homers by Corey Seager and Justin Turner. With his homer, Seager set a new record for the most home runs in the NLCS with five and passed Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez (2003) for most RBI in an NLCS with eleven. Buehler struck out six in six scoreless innings. Ronald Acu√±a Jr. doubled off the first reliever Blake Treinen to put the Braves on the board in the seventh inning. Fried did not allow any further runs as he went 6 innings, with eight hits and four walks allowed with five strikeouts. The Dodgers won 3‚Äì1 to force a winner take all seventh game. =Game 7= For the television broadcast by Fox Sports, Joe Davis filled-in for regular play-by-play announcer Joe Buck, due to Buck's obligation to NFL on Fox. Ian Anderson started Game 7 for the Braves opposite Dustin May, who served as an opener on one day's rest for the Dodgers. May walked a couple in the first and gave up the first run of the game on a single to Marcell Ozuna. Tony Gonsolin came in to pitch in the second and allowed a solo homer to Dansby Swanson. The Dodgers tied up the game in the third on a two-run single by Will Smith. In the fourth, Gonsolin walked the first two batters and then allowed an RBI single to Austin Riley to put the Braves back on top. However, the damage that inning was limited when, with runners on second and third and nobody out, Justin Turner fielded a Nick Markakis ground ball and alertly threw home to prevent Swanson from scoring; in the ensuing rundown, Turner dove to tag Swanson's shoe and then scrambled to his knees to throw out Riley trying to advance to third for an unusual 5‚Äì2‚Äì5‚Äì6 double play. In the sixth inning, Kik√© Hern√°ndez homered off A. J. Minter to tie it back up. Cody Bellinger gave the Dodgers their first lead of the game on a solo homer off Chris Martin in the seventh inning. Julio Ur√≠as pitched the last three innings to pick up the win as the Dodgers held on for the 4‚Äì3 victory. He retired Riley on a flyout to Bellinger to end the Braves' season and win their third NL pennant in the last four seasons. =Composite line score= 2020 NLCS (4‚Äì3): Los Angeles Dodgers defeated Atlanta Braves See also *2020 American League Championship Series References Further reading External links *Major League Baseball postseason schedule National League Championship Series Category:National League Championship Series Category:Atlanta Braves postseason Category:Baseball in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex National League Champtionship Series Category:Sports competitions in Texas Category:21st century in Arlington, Texas National League Championship Series National League Championship Series ","title":"2020 National League Championship Series"},{"id":"65331338","text":"James W.

Life Carbutt was born at Altona near Hamburg in 1832. Her parents were Louise Petronella and Francis Carbutt. Her father, a merchant and mayor of Leeds, had been a Quaker but he became a Unitarian. Her younger brother was Sir Edward Carbutt M.P. became an engineer. Her parents had progressive views on their children's education and in particular the daughters. She was sent to good boarding school until 1847 where she became proficient in four languages. She was not expected to marry but to decide her own career and she chose to teach German. Carbutt was asked if she woulds teach two children and she decided that she could use this as the basis of founding a school. The Brook House School opened in August 1860 with a small number of pupils. The school's approach was unusual in that the students were offered neither punishments or rewards for good behaviour. Nevertheless, the students were allowed more freedom than was usually permitted in comparable schools. One of the people she employed was William Henry Herford. He was a Unitarian minister, but he was also a writer and educator. They had similar views on education and she would in time become his second wife. In 1866 she was one of the people, mostly women, who signed the petition to parliament to request that women be allowed to vote. Brook House school closed in 1870 as Carbutt had health issues and she went to live in Leeds again where she was elected a Poor Law Guardian. This was an unusual position for a woman at that time. In 1884 she married William Herford. Herford had also started his own school in 1873 which unusually was co- educational. Carbutt died in Paignton in 1907. Her husband died in the following year.

One group speaks Western Pahari dialects while the other speaks Lahnda Western Punjabi dialects but call themselves as 'Pahari' speakers.  Speakers of Western Pahari dialects of Jammu and Kashmir  In Jammu and Kashmir, the Bhadarwahi, Sarazi, Bhalesi dialect, Padri dialect, Gaddi language and Kangri-Dogri dialects have been classified as Western Pahari by G.A. Grierson who done a comprehensive survey of Pahari languages/ dialects of British India in Linguistic Survey of India. The Speakers of these dailects are mainly found in Doda district, Ramban district and Kishtwar district, Kathua district and other Districts of Jammu and Kashmir (union territory).Defined as a \\"macrolanguage\\" in and as a \\"series of dialects\\" in .The classification there includes Rodhari as a separate node, but elsewhere (pp.123‚Äì24), it is subsumed under Khasali. *Map of Western Pahari languages from Grierson's early 20th-century Linguistic Survey of India.  Speakers of Lahnda- Western Punjabi dialects who call themselves Pahari Speaking  Another group who speaks Lahnda Western Punjabi dialects including Hindku, Punnchi, Pothowari, Chiballi, Mirpuri and Kaghani mainly lives in Poonch district, India, Rajouri district, Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnah in Indian Territory of Jammu and Kashmir also call themseleves 'Pahari Speaking People'. G.A. Grierson in first Linguistic Survey of British India while describing 364 languages and dialects classified these six dailects under Lahnda group of Punjabi but the speakers of Hindku, Punnchi, Pothowari, Chiballi, Mirpuri and Kaghani call themselves as 'Pahari Speaking People' for unkown reasons . \\"Linguistic Survey of India\\", Britannica OnlineCensus India, Statement 1: Abstract of Speakers' Strength of Languages and Mother Tongues 2011.In UT of Jammu and Kashmir the Hindku is spoken by people of Karnah Kupwara district and some other areas of Kashmir valley adjoining to Muzaffarabad , Punnchi is largely spoken in across Poonch, Rajouri districts , Shupian and other ajoining areas of Kashmir, while Pothowari spoken in Mendhar Tehsil other adjoining areas , Chiballi spoken in areas near Bhimber on LOC , Mirpuri spoken in Mirpur and some parts of Rajouri, Kaghani spoken by Kaghani Peers in a few areas of J&K.; Defined as a \\"macrolanguage\\" in and as a \\"series of dialects\\"in. Punchhi which is the main language spoken in Indian, Jammu and Kashmir (the main Language of Self-called Pahari Speaking People) is placed under Lahnda- Western Punjabi dialects in the census conducted in 2001 and 2011 by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India under Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs which is arranging, conducting and analyzing the results of the demographic surveys of India including Census of India and Linguistic Survey of India.Census India, Statement 1: Abstract of Speakers' Strength of Languages and Mother Tongues 2011 Script  The Western Pahari group writes Pahari in Devnagri and Perso-Arabic Script. In past, the Western Pahari was written in Takri script while Western Punjabi speakers who call their dialects as Pahari read, writes in Perso-Arabic, and claims that in past they use Sharda. Recognition of Pahari Language Along with other regional languages like Kashmiri, Dogri, Gojri, the Pahari was mentioned in the Sixth Schedule of the constitution of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.  Formation of new identity by Lahnda Western Punjabi speakers as Pahari Speaking People  In the late 70s, a group of people in J&K; who speak western Punjabi dialects including Hindku , Punnchi , Pothowari , Chiballi, Mirpuri , Kaghani have unanimously started calling themselves as Pahari language speakers and form a Pahari Speaking People group in Jammu and Kashmir at their own.The Jammu and Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages which was established in 1958 to works for languages listed in the Constitution of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, India has established Pahari Section in the Academy, in 1978 to promote Hindku , Punnchi , Pothowari , Chiballi, Mirpuri , Kaghani dialects. Constitution of Pahari Development Board In the year 1989 , the Government of Jammu and Kashmir constituted the State Advisory Board for the development of Pahari Speaking People (for Group B) with the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir as Chairman of the Board and the Vice-Chairman having Minister of State status. The Board serves for Hindku Speakers of Karnah , Punnchi speakers reside in Poonch , Rajouri , Pothowari speakers of Mendhar Tehsil Poonch and other parts of J&K; , Chiballi of Bhimbar adjoining areas in the Indian side, Mirpuri in some areas of Rajouri and Jammu , Kaghani Speakers some of them are Syed and Peers in Jammu and Kashmir. The Board provides scholarship ( Post/Pre-matric ) to school going Pahari speaking students, construction of new hostels for Pahari students and Management of Hostels, implementation of Pahari Sub-Plan on the pattern of Tribal Sub Plan besides promotion of Pahari Language, Literature and Culture. Grant of 4% Reservation for Paharis in J&K;  The Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir has recently granted four percent reservation to Pahari Speaking People which in direct recruitment and admission and distribution of seats in professional institutions at the postgraduate level for Hindku, Punnchi, Pothowari, Chiballi, Mirpuri and Kaghani Lahnda Western Punjabi who live in lives in Poonch, Rajouri, Uri, Karnah in Jammu and Kashmir. The Bhadarwahi, Sarazi , Bhalesi , Padri dialect Pogali speakers which classified under Western Pahari expressed dismay over the exclusion of real Pahari Speaker from 4% reservation. They sought Pahari status to the erstwhile Doda district, saying people living in remote and higher reaches speak Pahari and thus, deserve to be considered for benefits of reservations as applicable to this particular category. Refugees from Pakistani parts of Jammu and Kashmir , ‚Äútemporarily settled‚Äù in Jammu and adjoining districts, have claimed themselves to be the ‚Äúreal Paharis‚Äù as they speak Hindku , Punnchi , Pothowari , Chiballi, Mirpuri , Kaghani.The Hindu and Sikh refugees have already started an aggressive campaign to get them categorized as ‚ÄúPahari-speaking‚Äù people so as to take benefits of reservation. Demand for grant of Scheduled Tribe status to Pahari Speaking People  In 1989, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir had recommended to the Union Government of India to grant Scheduled Tribe status to Pahari Speaking People who live in lives in Poonch, Rajouri, Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnah in Indian Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and speak Hindku , Punnchi , Pothowari , Chiballi, Mirpuri , Kaghani- Lahnda dailects. In 1994, Rtd. General K.V Krishna Rao the then Governor of J&K; also recommended the Union Minister of Social Welfare Department for grant of ST status to Pahari Speaking People as Gujjars had been included in the list of ST having the same habitats. All the Chief Ministers of J&K; including Dr. Farooq Abdullah, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, Gulam Nabi Azad , Omar Abdullah , Mehbooba Mufti also recommended the case of Pahari Speaking People to New Delhi for grant of ST status.  Gujjars of J&K; opposing grant of ST status to Pahari Speaking People  Gurjars who are already enjoying Scheduled Tribes status in Jammu and Kashmir since 1991 are opposing the grant of ST status to Pahari Speaking People with the argument that such a step will dilute the entire ST status if a linguistic group gets an entry into the ambit of Tribes. As per Linguistic Survey of British India the groups claiming ST status under Pahari Speaking People Category are originally Lehndha -Western Punjabi speakers not the Western Pahari speakers, argued Gujjars. Paharis were neither identified or defined as a weaker section and nor they approached before the Anand Commission in 1976, Gajendragadkar Commission, the Sikri Commission, the Wazir Commission (1969), and the Mandal Commission 1980 which covered the entire country with regard to grant of reservation to backward communities/groups. All these commissions, from time to time, identified the Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes and none of them recognized any group as Pahari or Pahari speaking people as weaker section of the Society.

Painted in 1892, the painting is considered a very good example of Van Rysselberghe's pointillist technique, which, by the time he painted this oeuvre, had been completely absorbed and adjusted by the Belgian artist. The painting was sold in June 2017 for 8,483,750 GBP (about $11,684,302.65 in 2020) at Sotheby's in London. Background In 1884 Van Rysselberghe was one of the founders of the Neo- Impressionist group of Les XX. Van Rysselberghe was generally considered the leading artist of this group. He was close friends with artist Paul Signac (who was later inducted into the Les XX). Their friendship helped connect Van Rysselberghe's Les XX to Signac's Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants. Van Rysselberghe painted many waterscape paintings around 1890, among which is a portrait of Signac sailing on his boat and the Barques de p√™che‚ÄìM√©diterran√©e (1892), painted during Van Rysselberghe and Signac's two-month excursion in le Midi aboard Signac's boat the Olympia ( named after √âdouard Manet's painting). It was in this context that Van Ryselberghe realized L‚ÄôEscaut en amont d‚ÄôAnvers, le soir. Painting In contrast to his travelling companion and friend Signac, Van Rysselberghe was keen on permeating his paintings with atmosphere and animation. In L‚ÄôEscaut en amont d‚ÄôAnvers, le soir, or Evening, there is a remarkable and yet pleasingly measured contrast of yellow and orange against purple and blue. When compared to Signac's similar paintings from that period, Van Rysselberghe's painting has been described as having a heightened contrast, as well as being \\"more intimate and contemplative.\\" Cornelia Homburg wrote about the painting: > Th√©o van Rysselberghe employed a rather daring, restricted color scheme in > some of his compositions in order to evoke a mood. [‚Ä¶] purple and yellow > could be used to produce Big Clouds [1893 painting by Van Rysselberghe] or > to create a very different impact in The Scheldt Upstream from Antwerp, > Evening. This evening scene, with its intense hues, invites us to lose > ourselves in reverie. The anchor poles and their reflection in the water > provide a gentle rhythm to the composition, while the sailboat‚Äôs calm path > underlines the evocative atmosphere. Robert Harper wrote about this work: > The unusual simplicity of the seascape is a mark of the period 1892-1894, > his [Van Rysselberghe's] best in landscape. [The present work] has a strong > yellow that comes from a moist, but sunlit afternoon, forcefully opposed to > lavender and blue, and each shares a Belgian penchant for limiting the > surface to very few planes. After having been exhibited in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, and the Phillips Collection, and being held for about fifty years in the private collection of American banker Arthur G.

Founded in 1980, the mosque is one of the largest in the Southeastern United States. The current building, located in Atlanta's Home Park neighborhood, was completed in 2008.  History  Al-Farooq Masjid was founded in Atlanta in 1980 in response to a growing population of South Asian Muslims in the city, including students from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). The mosque was the first majority-immigrant mosque in the city, though several mosques serving African-American Muslims were present in the city at the time. It was established in Home Park, a neighborhood close to Georgia Tech. The mosque later established a cemetery, and in the 1990s they opened two schools. In 1990, the mosque opened a K-8 school, and in 1992 another school was opened, focusing on Islamic studies. Al-Farooq later established an affiliated mosque in Norcross, Georgia. In 1999, the mosque began a series of major renovations, and in 2003, construction began on a new mosque building. This building, which cost $10 million, was completed in 2008. The new building features two copper domes, the larger of which reminiscent of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, and can hold an estimated 5,000 people. The new octagonal-shpaed building also features a tall minaret, mashrabiya-covered balconies, and entryways featuring pointed arches. As of 2015, the mosque averaged approximately 1,000 attendees to Friday prayer sessions.

Completed and commissioned in January 1944, she served in the late stages of World War II, she conducted war patrols in the Pacific Ocean as a conventional submarine before she was converted into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier. She then conducted kaiten operations during the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa before she was sunk in April 1945. Construction and commissioning I-44 was laid down on 11 June 1942 by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal at Yokosuka, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 374. Eventually named , she was launched on 5 March 1943. She was completed and commissioned on 31 January 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-44 was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 in the 6th Fleet. Once her workups were complete, she called at the Tokuyama Fuel Depot from 28 to 29 March 1944 to refuel. =First war patrol= On 31 March 1944, I-44 and the submarines , , , and received orders to deploy in the Pacific Ocean east of Palau to intercept a Palau-bound United States Navy task force. She got underway from Agenosho Bay that day, but received a recall order on 5 April 1944. She arrived at Kure on 14 April 1944. After her arrival at Kure, I-44 became the first Japanese submarine fitted with the Type 13 air-search radar. =Operation Tatsumaki= I-44 was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in Submarine Squadron 1 in the Advance Unit in the 6th Fleet on 28 April 1944. In May 1944, she and the submarines , , and and the auxiliary submarine tender began training in the Seto Inland Sea off Nasakejima for Operation Tatsumaki (\\"Tornado\\"), which called for the submarines to transport modified Type 4 Ka-Tsu amphibious tracked landing craft, each armed with two torpedoes, from Kure to Majuro. After the submarines launched the Ka-Tsu vehicles, the operation called for the vehicles to proceed to shore, move overland across the atoll's islands, then enter the water in the lagoon and attack Allied ships with torpedoes. Operation Tatsumaki later was postponed pending the correction of defects found in the Ka-Tsu vehicles and eventually was canceled entirely. =Second war patrol= On 15 May 1944, I-44 departed Kure along with I-41 and I-53 to begin her second war patrol. The three submarines were assigned to picket duty off the Bismarck Archipelago, northeast of New Ireland and north of Kavieng. One source has suggested that the U.S. submarine torpedoed and damaged I-44 on 26 May 1944, but Japanese sources do not confirm this. Instead, while I-44 was on the surface in the Pacific Ocean in the vicinity of on 27 May 1944 and operating her new air-search radar, an Allied plane surprised her and scored several near-misses; Japanese historians disagree on whether the radar set was defective or its inexperienced operator made mistakes while still learning to use it properly. She crash-dived, but several patrol vessels then attacked her, scoring several more near-misses. She rigged for silent running, and eventually broke contact with them. With her periscopes, her main switchboard, and many of her instruments damaged and a leak in her bow section, she surfaced after escaping the Allied vessels. She soon sighted a U.S. Navy PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol bomber flying nearby; unable to submerge again, she evaded the plane by escaping into a rain squall. She reached Kure on 5 June 1944 and underwent repairs there. =Third war patrol= The commander-in- chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, activated Operation Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1 for the defense of the Philippine Islands on 13 October 1944. With her repairs complete, I-44 got underway from Kure on 19 October 1944 for her third war patrol, assigned a patrol area east of the Philippines and off Leyte as part of Submarine Group B, which also included the submarines , , and . She was in the Bashi Channel in darkness on 20 October 1944 when an explosion in her automatic trim system pressure tank killed three members of her crew, wrecked her gyrocompass, and disabled one of her propeller shafts. Forced to return to Japan for repairs, she arrived at Kure on 22 October 1944. =Conversion to kaiten carrier= The last surviving Type B2 submarine, I-44 was selected for conversion to carry kaiten suicide attack torpedoes. While she was under repair, her deck gun was removed to make room on her afterdeck for fittings to allow her to carry four kaitens abaft her conning tower and her aircraft hangar and catapult were removed from her foredeck to make room forward of her conning tower for the fittings for two more kaitens. In addition, a Type 22 surface-search radar also was installed aboard her. The Japanese originally intended to assign I-44 to take part in the first operational use of kaitens, but cancelled her participation in the mission in early November 1944. In early February 1945, she received orders to proceed to the kaiten base at Otsujima along with the submarines and to begin kaiten- handling training. =First kaiten mission= On 19 February 1945, the Battle of Iwo Jima began with the U.S. landings on Iwo Jima. That day, I-44, I-368, and I-370 were assigned to the Chihaya Kaiten Group, with orders to attack Allied ships off the island. I-44 was the last of the three submarines to get underway, departing Otsujima at 09:00 on 22 February 1945 for her fourth war patrol and first kaiten mission. She was on the surface recharging her batteries southwest of Iwo Jima on 25 February 1945 when two or three Allied warships ‚Äî which her lookouts identified as destroyers or submarine chasers ‚Äî sighted her and forced her to dive. She remained submerged for 47 hours, during which the carbon dioxide levels inside her reached 6 percent, before she could break contact and surface safely. I-44 reached her patrol area south of Iwo Jima late on 26 February 1945. On 28 February, she attempted an approach to Iwo Jima on the surface from east of the island, but a TBF Avenger aircraft attacked her and forced her to submerge and retire. Later that day, her commanding officer reported the incident and I-44‚Ä≤s withdrawal, but his message did not reach the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Miwa. On 1 March 1945, she reported her commanding officer's intention to move to the Okidait≈çjima area in the Dait≈ç Islands southeast of Okinawa, but after 6th Fleet headquarters asked her on 2 March 1945 to report her location and any success she had had against Allied ships, her reply on 3 March 1945 was a routine situation report which failed to provide the details the 6th Fleet had requested. On 6 March 1945, the 6th Fleet cancelled all submarine operations in the Iwo Jima area, and I-44 headed for Japan. She disembarked her kaitens and their pilots at Otsujima on 9 March and on 11 March she arrived at Kure, where Miwa relieved her commanding officer of command. =Second kaiten mission= Between 26 and 29 March 1945, U.S. forces landed in the Kerama Islands southwest of Okinawa and captured advance bases in preparation for an invasion of Okinawa itself. On 27 March 1945, the Tatara Kaiten Group ‚Äî which included I-44 and the submarines , , and , each carrying six kaitens ‚Äî was formed to attack Allied ships off Okinawa. On 1 April 1945, the Battle of Okinawa began with U.S. landings on the island, and on 3 April I-44 received orders to get underway for Okinawan waters as part of the Tatara Group. She departed Otsujima on 4 April 1945 for her fifth war patrol and second kaiten mission, carrying the same four kaiten pilots as she had on the Chihaya Group deployment. On 21 April 1945, 6th Fleet headquarters ordered her to return to Japan, but she did not reply. =Loss= I-44 was lost sometime in April 1945, and the circumstances of her loss remain unknown. Some Japanese historians have concluded that a hunter-killer group made up of the light aircraft carrier and several destroyers sank I-44 on 18 April 1945, but it is more likely that the submarine sunk in the action was I-56. On 29 April 1945, a TBM Avenger of U.S. Navy Composite Squadron 92 (VC-92) took off from the escort aircraft carrier southeast of Okinawa at 14:18. During the flight, the Avenger's crew sighted a Japanese submarine on the surface and dived on it from an altitude of . As the submarine crash-dived, the plane dropped a depth charge that exploded adjacent to the submarine's conning tower. On its next pass, the Avenger dropped a Mark 24 \\"Fido\\" acoustic homing torpedo which exploded against the submarine's hull, sinking it at . The submarine probably was I-44. On 2 May 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-44 to be presumed lost in the Okinawa area with the loss of all 134 men aboard ‚Äî 130 crewmen and four embarked kaiten pilots. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 June 1945. Notes Sources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander. IJN Submarine I-44: Tabular Record of Movement. Retrieved on September 16, 2020.

It was announced at Facebook Connect 7 and shipped on October 13, 2020. As with its predecessor, the Quest 2 is capable of running as both a standalone headset with an internal, Android-based operating system, and with Oculus-compatible VR software running on a PC when connected over USB.  Hardware  Its design is similar to the original Oculus Quest, but replacing the black, cloth- covered exterior with a white plastic appearance and black facial interface. It is lighter than the first-generation Quest, at 503 grams (17.7 ounces) in comparison to 571 grams (20.1 ounces). The strap was changed to a fabric-based version (rather than the elastic-based strap of the Quest), while the USB-C port was re-located to the rear of the headset. The Quest 2 utilizes the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 system-on-chip (part of a line designed primarily for VR and augmented reality devices) with 6 GB of RAM (in comparison to 4 GB in the first-generation model). It uses a single fast-switch LCD panel with a 1832√ó1920 per eye resolution. It supports a 90 Hz refresh rate (an increase from the 72 Hz of the first-generation model), but this will only be available from within the home area on launch; a future update will enable 90 Hz support within games. The headset includes physical interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustment at 58 mm, 63 mm and 68 mm, adjusted by physically moving the lenses into each position. The included Oculus Touch controllers were updated with a slightly larger size influenced by the first-generation version. Facebook also stated that their battery life had been increased four-fold over the controllers included with the first-generation Quest.  Games  Unlike the original Oculus Quest, the Oculus Quest 2 is not backwards compatible with Oculus Go apps and games. It otherwise supports all games and software that supported on the first-generation model.  Accessories  Oculus presented an \\"Elite Strap\\" accessory, which contains a ringlike pad for the back of the head and a tightness dial, including a variant with a battery pack built into the headstrap. Oculus is also promoting Logitech headphones \\"certified\\" for Quest 2 (including the G333 VR, the company's first-ever in-ear headphones) which have shortened cords designed for use with headsets. Oculus also partnered with Logitech to support their K830 keyboard as part of Oculus's Infinite Office feature, allowing the user to see the keyboard and hands while typing in VR.  Release  Quest 2 was officially unveiled on September 16, 2020 during Facebook Connect 7. The 64 GB model was priced at US$299, a $100 decrease over the original Quest model. The 128 GB model of the first- generation Quest was replaced by a 256 GB model at US$399.  Reception  Besides existing criticism over the mandate that Facebook accounts be used on the Quest 2 and all future Oculus products, The Verge was positive in a pre- release review, noting that while it lacked standout features, it did have \\"worthwhile\\" improvements such as reduced weight, a screen with a better visual appearance and refresh rate than the original Quest, and a re-located USB port. The new strap was panned for having \\"less support and a slightly clumsier tightening mechanism\\" (although partly rectified by the Elite Strap accessory), and the new IPD mechanism was considered \\"annoying\\" and not as inclusive as that of the first-generation model. In conclusion, it was argued that while it was not a \\"must-upgrade\\" for existing owners, the Quest 2 had \\"the best overall balance of hardware, features, and price.\\" Ars Technica was less positive, panning the new cloth strap in comparison to the original Quest's elastic straps, the limited IPD options, worse battery life, and the controllers having less grip and reduced accuracy on more intensive games. The switch from OLED to LCD was shown to produce \\"crisper\\" images but more \\"washed out\\" color. The headset was criticized at launch after some users were unable to use the headset due to their Facebook account being suspended. Some described the headset as being a \\"paperweight\\".

Crudgington (1852‚Äì1931) was a Baptist missionary from Ireland who was active in the Congo region before the Congo Free State was established. Early years H. E. Crudgington was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1852. He studied theology at Rawdon College, Leeds, England, and studied medicine at the hospital in Leeds. He was the first to be accepted by the Baptist Missionary Society of England as one of the pioneers who were going to help Thomas J. Comber found the Congolese Mission. Congo mission =Early days (1879‚Äì1881)= The small group of missionaries arrived in Banana on 9 June 1879, and went on to S√£o Salvador. At first they lived in straw huts, but by the next spring they had completed a stone house. Comber and Crudgington left on 2 January 1880 hoping to reach Stanley Pool. They received a friendly reception almost everywhere, particularly in Mwala, where they stayed for a week. Crudgington stayed on for five weeks, practiced medicine and founded a children's school. None of their attempts for 18 months managed to reach the Pool. During one of these trips Crudgington received an iron projectile in his back that penetrated to a depth of , and had to return to San Salvador to have it removed. =Journey to Stanley Pool (1881)= The missionaries decided to advance simultaneously along both banks of the river. Crudgington and William Holman Bentley left San Salvador on 8 January 1881 and followed the north shore, walking for 8 to 19 hours each day for 21 days through the Basundi and Babwende region to Stanley Pool. In Kintamo (Kinshasa) they had a reasonably friendly reception from Chief Ngaliema. Further up the local people were hostile, taking them for the advance guard of Henry Morton Stanley's expedition. When the French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza had passed through in the other direction, he had advised the people to resist Stanley's Belgians. The missionaries returned by a shorter route that took only 15 days. On 26 February 1881 Henry Morton Stanley, Victor Harou and Paul N√®ve boarded the Royal and steamed upstream from Isangila. At Nsouki they freed Crudgington and Bentley, whom the local people had taken prisoner. In total they had covered and had been the first Europeans to reach the west shore of the Pool. =Later career= After his return, Crudgington suffered from feverish hemoglobinuria for two weeks. The missionaries decided that he should return to England to tell the society's committee about the mission's situation and expedite shipment of provisions and back-up personnel. Crudgington also hoped to be able to acquire a steel whaling boat for use in the navigable part of the Congo River between Isangila and Manyanga. Crudgington toured England raising support for the mission, and a friend from Plymouth gave him a whaling boat named the Plymouth. He left England to return to the Congo on 18 April 1882 with supplies and new staff, including Herbert Dixon. Life was difficult for the missionaries in the early days. The journey from Vivi to Isangila took three days, over rugged country. Crudgington once had to walk to have a tooth extracted. He married when he returned on leave to England for a second time. His wife came with him on his return to the Congo, but suffered badly from fevers. For this reason, the Missionary Society sent the couple to their mission in Delhi, India. Crudgington died in Bath, Somerset, England in 1931.

The exceptions includes caving, cross- country skiing including Reena Kaushal Dharmshaktu, the first Indian woman to ski to South Pole, hang gliding, microlight aviation including businessman Vijaypat Singhania, chairman emeritus of the Raymond Group and the pilot of world record setting flight from the UK to India, and white water rafting. * INSV Tarini with members of Navika Sagar Parikrama leaving Cape Town Usually the award is conferred upon three to six people in a year, a few exceptions have been made in the years 1994, 1995, 2017 and 2019, when more than six recipients were awarded in a year. In its initial year, twenty-two awards were presented, the highest so far for a single year. Nineteen of these awards were given to the 1993 Indo-Nepalese Women's Everest Expedition lead by Bachendri Pal. The expedition created four world records at the time including the largest number of mountaineers (eighteen) from a single expedition and the largest number of women (seven) from a single country to scale Everest. In 2017, ten awards were presented, out of which six were given to the members of Navika Sagar Parikrama. They were an all women Indian Navy officers sailing team for the circumnavigation of globe, on board the Indian Navy Sailing Vessel Tarini (pictured), led by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi. Chandraprabha Aitwal (pictured) is the only double recipient of the award, once in 1994 in the category of land adventure for being part of 1993 Indo- Nepalese Women's Everest Expedition and second time in 2009 in the category of lifetime achievement in the discipline of mountaineering. Prior to creation of this award as Arjuna award used to be also given for adventure sports and mountaineering, eight people have won both the awards. Five expedition members of India's first successful bid to Mount Everest in 1965, Nawang Gombu, Gurdial Singh, Mohan Singh Kohli, H. P. S. Ahluwalia and Sonam Wangyal were awarded the lifetime achievement awards in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2017 respectively. They were all awarded the team Arjuna award in 1965. Chandraprabha Aitwal and Bachendri Pal were awarded the Arjuna Award in field of mountaineering in 1981 and 1984 respectively. Bula Choudhury was awarded the Arjuna award in 1990 in the field of swimming and was presented with the adventure award in 2002 for lifetime achievement in the disciple of open water swimming. Over the years, number of firsts and records in the adventure activities have been awarded. In the field of mountaineering, Love Raj Singh Dharmshaktu (awarded in 1999) has gone on to climb Everest seven times, the highest for an Indian. Arunima Sinha (awarded in 2014) became world's first female amputee to scale Everest. Twins Tashi and Nungshi Malik (awarded in 2015) became the first twins in the world to complete Seven Summits and Explorers Grand Slam. Anshu Jamsenpa (awarded in 2017) is the fastest female double summiteer of Everest, doing so in five days. In the field of sailing, Dilip Donde (awarded in 2010) became the first Indian to circumnavigate the globe under sail solo and unassisted. Abhilash Tomy (awarded in 2012) bettered the record by being the first Indian to do it non-stop. In the field of skydiving, Rachel Thomas (awarded in 1994) became India's first female skydiver and Shital Mahajan (awarded in 2005) was the youngest woman to jump over both the poles. Controversies The initial publication on 21 August 2020 of the 2019 awardees list had the name of mountaineer Narender Singh in the category of land adventure. His name in the list of awardees created controversy in the mountaineering circles in India and abroad. On 23 August, the Katmandu-based daily Kantipur published the photo that Singh had submitted to the authorities in Nepal as proof of reaching Everest summit in 2016. The article explained how the photo in question was morphed. Several mountaineers pointed out the inaccuracies in the photo including oxygen mask not having a pipe, no reflections on his sunglasses, flags he carried being still despite the high winds, no headlamps on his head and him wearing a helmet which is not worn by climbers on their summit day. His team leader Naba Kumar Phukon, rescue team member Lakhpa Sherpa and senior mountaineer Debashis Biswas attested to the fact that Singh never made it to the top of Everest and had to be helped down after getting stranded at the Balcony at 8,400 m (27,600 ft). Tenzing Norgay's son Jamling Norgay took up the matter and raised the issue with Indian Mountaineering Foundation. Soon after that, the Sports Ministry opened a probe into the claims, withholding the award on 28 August and in the list of awardees attending next day's ceremony, Singh's name was omitted. Jamling Norgay and Bachendri Pal expressed displeasure that such a person was even considered for the award in the first place. Jamling further noted that the awards should not be simply awarded to the Everest climbers, but to those who inspire other adventure seekers by scaling new peaks, exploring new routes and promoting adventure in general.

As a two- year-old in 2020 she made steady progress, winning a minor race on her second start and going on to take the Silver Flash Stakes and finish second in the Debutante Stakes before winning the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes. Background Shale is a bay filly with a large white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by the Coolmore Stud. She raced in the clolours of the Coolmore partners Derrick Smith, Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor. The filly was sent into training with Donnacha O'Brien at Goolds Cross, County Tipperary. She was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his eleventh champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2019. His other progeny include Frankel, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found Minding, Love and Ruler of the World. Shale was the fourth foal of Homecoming Queen who won the 1000 Guineas in 2012. Homecoming Queen was a daughter of the outstanding broodmare Lagrion, making her a half-sister to Dylan Thomas, Queen's Logic and Remember When (the dam of Serpentine). Racing career =2020: two-year-old season= Shale made her racing debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown on 21 June in which she was ridden by the apprentice jockey Gavin Ryan and came home sixth of the seven runners behind Oodnadatta at odds of 10/1. Seventeen days later, with Ryan again in the saddle, she started joint-favourite for a similar event over one mile on soft to heavy ground at Gowran Park and recorded her first victory as she led for most of the way before drawing away in the final furlong to win \\"comfortably\\" by three and quarter lengths from High Heels. On 6 August at Leopardstown the filly was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Silver Flash Stakes and started a 14/1 outsider in a field of eight with Ryan again taking the ride despite being unable to claim his apprentice weight allowance. Shale raced in second place behind the pacemaker Finest before taking the lead a furlong out and holding off the challenge of the favourite Pretty Gorgeous (trained by Donnacha O'Brien's older brother Joseph) to win by one and a half lengths. After the race Donnacha O'Brien commented \\"She did it well. Obviously she improved from her maiden and her work was good. The race worked out nicely as they went a good gallop and she got a nice tow into it.\\" Sixteen days after her win in the Silver Flash Shale was made 7/4 favourite for the Group 2 Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse but after taking the lead approaching the final furlong she was overtaken and beaten two and a half lengths into second place by Pretty Gorgeous. Ryan Moore took over from Ryan when Shale faced Pretty Gorgeous for the third time in the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh on 13 September and started the 9/2 second favourite behind her rival. The other eleven contenders included Mother Earth (Fillies' Sprint Stakes), Oodnadatta and Teresa Mendoza (second in the Round Tower Stakes). Shale tracked the leaders in fourth place before moving up to take the lead inside the last quarter mile and repelled a sustained challenge from Pretty Gorgeous to win by three quarters of a length with a further one and three quarter lengths back to Oodnadatta in third. Donnacha O'Brien said \\"It was a lovely performance. She was one of the first off the bridle and at halfway I didn't think she was going to do anything, but she found plenty for pressure. She was always a nice filly, but wasn't one we thought would be capable of winning a Moyglare at the start of the year ‚Äì she's kept progressing the whole way\\". On 9 October Shale was sent to England and moved up in distance for the Fillies' Mile at Newmarket Racecourse where she started 7/2 second favourite behind Pretty Gorgeous. She in mid-division but was unable to challenge the leaders and faded in the closing stages to come home sixth of the ten runners behind Pretty Gorgeous, finishing almost seven lengths behind her old rival.

According to the Council of Europe's handbook on the subject, the phrase is \\"arguably one of the most important clauses in the entire Convention\\". Indeed, the Court has itself written that \\"the concept of a democratic society... prevails throughout the Convention\\".Lingens v. Austria; The purpose of making such claims justiciable is to ensure that the restriction is actually necessary, rather than enacted for political expediency, which is not allowed. Articles 8‚Äì11 of the convention are those that protect right to family life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of association respectively. Along with the other tests which are applied to these articles, the restrictions on Articles 8‚Äì11 have been described as \\"vast limitations\\", in contrast to American law which recognizes nearly unlimited right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment. In the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, \\"necessary in a democratic society\\" is further defined as meeting a \\"pressing social need\\" and \\"relevant and sufficient\\" to a legitimate aim. The court has defined \\"necessary\\" as somewhere between \\"reasonable\\" or \\"desirable\\" and \\"indispensable\\". When defining what constitutes a \\"democratic society\\" for the purposes of the test, the Court considers that freedom of speech is one of its foundations (hence restrictions on it must be narrow and focused). The court also considers that \\"democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail\\" and that \\"a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position\\". In the Greek case (1969), the European Commission of Human Rights found that restrictions imposed by the Greek junta on freedom of association were a violation of the Convention because they worked to create a \\"police state, which is the antithesis of a 'democratic society. The test was developed in the Handyside v. United Kingdom, Silver v. United Kingdom, and Lingens v. Austria cases, related to freedom of expression. It has also been invoked in cases involving state surveillance, which the court acknowledges can constitute an Article 8 violation but may be \\"strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions\\" (Klass and Others v. Germany). The court has also held that restrictions on obscenity and blasphemy may satisfy the requirement of being \\"necessary in a democratic society\\", something which is not disputed even by the minority of judges who disagree that such bans are compatible with the convention. It has recently caused controversy in cases where a burqa ban has been judged \\"necessary in a democratic society\\" (e.g. in S.A.S. v.

It lies on the Puna high plateau next to two other lakes and salt flats. The lake is less than deep and forms a rough rectangle with a surface of . Laguna Socompa loses its water through evaporation, and is replenished through surface runoff and groundwater which ultimately originate to a large part from snowmelt. The waters of the lake are salty. On the southeastern shore of the lake, microbialites grow in the shallow water. These are structures formed by carbonate and microorganisms including diatoms and various bacteria. These structures have a layered internal structure and colours ranging from green to orange-pink to black. They have been compared to Precambrian stromatoliths, which were among the oldest forms of life on Earth.  Regional and local  Laguna Negra lies at an elevation of in the Tinogasta Department, Catamarca Province of Argentina, and near the San Francisco Pass between Chile and Argentina. The path to Monte Pissis passes close to the lake. It covers a surface of and has the rough shape of a rectangle. The average depth of the lake does not exceed . The lake periodically floods its beaches. To the northwest, a salt flat separates the lake from its neighbours to the north and covers over half of the lake basin. A prominent alluvial fan borders Laguna Negra to the southeast and its northward growth has generated a shallow water area at the southeastern margin of the lake (Stromatolite Belt). The waters of the lake are hypersaline, their principal salt is calcium chloride, although they have been described as mesosaline too. Arsenic is present at high concentrations. The high salinity prevents the water from freezing except at the margins of Laguna Negra, where salinity is lower due to inflow. Calcite and aragonite reach saturation concentration at points where groundwater enters the lake, leading to carbonate precipitation mainly along the southeastern margin of the lake. Conditions in the lake environments are alkaline. The lake is fed by groundwater and by runoff that enters mainly from the southwestern side. The water mainly originates through annual snowmelt. Laguna Negra has no surface outflow; the lake waters evaporate in the strong wind and at high temperatures, leading to the precipitation of salts such as gypsum, halite and polyhalite. = Regional context = Laguna Negra is the southernmost of three lakes aligned in north-south direction; the other two are Laguna de la Salina/Laguna Tres Quebradas to the north and Laguna Verde in the middle. They form the Laguna Verde Saline Complex, also known as Laguna Verde Complex or Salar de la Laguna Verde. The Salar de Tres Quebradas salt pan separates Laguna Verde from Laguna Tres Quebradas. Together these two lakes have a water surface of . Smaller lakes exist nearby such as Laguna Azul northeast of Laguna Negra.

The terrain consists mainly of volcanic rocks such as basalt and andesite; some summits exceed elevation above sea level such as the high Cerro Pissis. Evaporites, sand and silt cover the area of the lake.  Climate and vegetation  The climate at Laguna Negra is arid with strong winds. Temperature is highly variable, ranging between in summer and between in winter. Annual precipitation is less than and falls mainly as snow. Evidence from other lakes in the region suggests that the environment was wetter than today between about 15,000-14,000 and 13,500-11,300 years before becoming dry during the middle Holocene. After about 4,000 years BP it has increased again. Presently, the climate is dominated by the South Pacific High anticyclone which draws dry air into the region. During summer, an Atlantic anticyclone conversely transports moister and warmer air to the area, resulting in the formation of convective clouds and precipitation. Climatic conditions together with high UV radiation limit the complexity of life at Laguna Negra, in particular of nonmicrobial life. Salt marsh grasses of the genus Spartina grow at the southern end of the lake, and copepods were observed in ponds; both are linked to areas with lower salinity.  Carbonates and microbial mats  Both microbial mats and microbialites occur at Laguna Negra and have diverse shapes. Their formation results mainly from the localized precipitation of carbonates where new water enters Laguna Negra. At the southern end of the lake, travertine crusts are found; they might form at sites of groundwater entry. Active tufa formation has been observed, making Laguna Negra one of only two lakes in the region where it takes place. White incrustations are formed by evaporation, when salt precipitates. In the Stromatolite Belt, a large area at the southeastern part of the lake where water depths do not exceed , they form laminar crusts, oncoids and stromatolites that are accompanied by microbial mats. Oncoids make up the bulk of the Stromatolite Belt. They can have smooth forms and ridged, pillar- or shrub-like protrusions and reach dimensions of over . They can be buried in mud, submerged or partially emerged, and sometimes covered with halite. Colours range from green-yellow over orange to snow white, and the structures have the appearance of rocks strewn onto and emerging from the shallow lake. The oncoids have a concentrically layered internal structure, with the various layers often having different colours; the colour variations relate to compositional differences. The microscopic texture has been described as sparry, \\"micritic\\" and \\"botryoidal\\". Microbial mats have colours ranging from back over pinkish- orange to greenish, and their structure ranges from pustular to stratified. Most are associated with oncoids. Greenish mats occur next to groundwater springs and often are found floating on bubbles, and black mats are found on partially exposed carbonates. The black mats are formed mainly by filamentous cyanobacteria of the Rivularia family. Layered microbial mats, where different layers have different colours, are found within deep ponds. So-called \\"diatom blooms\\" are linked to white carbonate precipitates that form bright spots on the coloured mats. The colours of the microbial constructs are due to carotenoid and scytonemin pigments, which serve to protect the microorganisms from UV radiation. Radiometric dating of the carbonate structures is difficult owing to the scarcity of datable material, but uranium-thorium dating performed on one oncolites indicates that it began to develop in the Late Holocene. Observations indicate that the growth of the oncoliths is still ongoing. = Biology and scientific importance = There are both autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms in Laguna Negra. Autotrophs include cyanobacteria, as well as green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria which conduct anoxygenic photosynthesis; sulfur deposits form during the process. Heterotrophic organisms include polysaccharide degrading and sulfate- reducing bacteria. There is a layering in metabolic activity, with regular photosynthesis at the surface, anoxygenic photosynthesis in intermediary layers and sulfate reduction at depth. Many microorganisms are extremophiles and tolerate high salinity and intense UV radiation. Precipitation of carbonates is often associated with life and may be induced by the latter for various reasons, although at Laguna Negra it can also occur independently from biological activity. Subtle environmental variations and changes influence the life in the lake and the structure of the microbial mats. The microbial mats are found in the less saline sector of Laguna Negra, implying that reduced salt stress favours their development. Stromatolites have been found elsewhere in the Puna, at Socompa and Tolar Grande. They are considered to be among the oldest forms of life on Earth and a key indicator in the search for extraterrestrial life. The forms found at Laguna Negra resemble these of ancient Precambrian stromatolites more than these of recent Proterozoic stromatolites, and the conditions encountered at the lake may resemble these of Early Earth and Early Mars and could thus be used as an analogue to interpret deposits on Mars. = Microbes = Cyanobacteria and diatoms form aggregates together and with other microorganisms. The aggregates in turn are embedded in exopolysaccharide capsules where carbonates precipitate. Living diatoms are often found at the margin of aggregates while their interiors feature \\"entombed\\" diatoms. The bacterial species Rivularia halophila was discovered at Laguna Negra; it is the first Rivularia species known from hypersaline inland waters. Another species identified and named there is Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha, although that species was originally discovered elsewhere.  Lithium mining  Lithium mining has been prospected at the neighbouring Salar Tres Quebradas. Lithium is a key component of battery production.

In the book, Precht calls for a ‚ÄûBildungsrevolution‚Äú (\\"educational revolution\\") for the German school system, among other things with a new version of the role of teachers and teacher training as well as with the targeted promotion of intrinsic learning motivation of students while eliminating the conventional grading system. In connection with the individualization of teaching and learning processes in cross-year projects and in all-day school operations, Precht would also move away from the scheme of subject-specific 45-minute lessons. The book received a predominantly critical reception in the media.  Overview  = Structure = The two main parts of the book follow on from the introduction under the heading Anna, the School and the good Lord. The first main part under the title Die Bildungskatastrophe (The Education Catastrophe) consists of five sub-chapters: 1\\\\. Was ist Bildung? (What is education?); 2. Klassenkampf in der Schule (class struggle in school); 3. PISA, G8 und andere Dummheiten (PISA, G8 and other stupid things); 4. Das Dilemma unserer Schule (The dilemma of our schools); 5. Lehrer als Beruf (Teacher as a profession). The second main part, entitled Die Bildungsrevolution (The Educational Revolution), contains six subsections: 1. Bildung im 21. Jahrhundert (Education in the 21st Century); 2. Wie geht das Lernen? (How does learning work?); 3. Individualisiertes Lernen (Individualized learning); 4. Jenseits von Fach und Note (Beyond subject and grade); 5. Bessere Schulen (Better schools); 6. Bildung f√ºr alle! (Education for everyone!). = Content = Richard David Precht writes that Germany has, according to OECD studies, ‚Äûeines der schlechtesten Schul- und Bildungssysteme unter allen Industrienationen der Welt‚Äú (\\"one of the worst school and education systems among all industrial nations in the world\\"). Precht calls ten principles of a holistic modification for a contemporary school system in his book: # The child's intrinsic motivation is to be given priority. # Individual learning should be made possible and supported according to one's own talent and learning pace. # Not just learning material, but the understanding of the meaning and sensuality of things and the context of this world is to be conveyed, primarily in projects. # The bond of the individual in the community should be considered as an important learning factor. # The organization of school operations should promote a culture of relationships and responsibility, for example by subdividing the operation into various ‚Äúlearning houses‚Äù. # Values and appreciation for one's own learning environment are to be promoted through rituals, among other things. # A learner-friendly school architecture with a campus as the center can and should contribute to a positive school and learning climate. # The ability to concentrate must be trained and maintained throughout school. # A personal evaluation with the help of monitoring related to the individuality of the child is intended to replace the conventional number system. # The all-day school enables educational equality in that all learning relevant for the school takes place in the school (and not also with homework or in extracurricular tutoring).  Reception  Peter Praschl from German newspaper Die Welt described the book as ‚Äûsinnlos, √ºberfl√ºssig, ein 352 Seiten langes √Ñrgernis‚Äú (\\"pointless, superfluous, a 352 page long annoyance\\"), criticizing that Precht's diagnosis is true, but nothing about it is original. Katja Weise from Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) praised the book for its ideas. J√ºrgen Kaube from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) criticized the book for the fact that almost all of his theses have long been established and the very few arguments for his statements. According to Oberhessische Presse, the book is a ‚Äûrealit√§tsferne Vision eines selbsternannten Heilsbringers, der mit Modebegriffen und Medienhype Altbekanntes als Sensation verkauft‚Äú ( \\"unrealistic vision of a self-proclaimed savior who sells well-known things as a sensation with fashion and media hype\\").

Lembke appeared in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma.  Early life and education  Lembke was an undergraduate student at Yale University. She moved to Stanford University for her medical degree, where she completed her residency in psychiatry. She was a medical intern at the Alameda County Highland Hospital, where she specialised in adult psychiatry and addiction. She was board certified in 2003.  Research and career  At Stanford University, Lembke runs a dual diagnosis clinic; which supports people with more than one addiction. These are typically patients who are depressed or anxious and also addicted to substances (drugs, alcohol) or processes (gambling, sex). Their main treatment involves a four-week abstinence from the addictive behaviour, which she has shown is the minimum amount of time to reset their brain pathways. Lembke was one of the first physicians to speak openly about the opioid epidemic. She wrote the popular science book, Drug Dealer, MD, which resulted in Lembke travelling the United States and delivering expert testimony to legislators. She delivered a TED talk on the opioid epidemic and pain management at TEDx Stanford. Alongside drugs and alcohol, Lembke has studied smartphone and technology addiction. Smartphones are not only addictive themselves; but exacerbate the problems of other substance/process addictions, increasing access and social contagion. Lembke appeared on the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, explaining that \\"social media is a drug\\", which exploits the brain's evolutionary need for interpersonal connection.

Everett's company, The American Bottle Company, merged with Corning to eventually become Owens Corning. Prior to the 1929 stock market crash, His estimated wealth was between $40‚Äì50 million. Everett also owned Ch√¢teau de l'Aile in Vevey, Switzerland and The Orchards, his summer residence in Bennington, Vermont that was also designed by Totten and later became Southern Vermont College. The house was designed by George Oakley Totten Jr., a graduate of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris who was one of Washington D.C.'s most prolific and skilled architects in the Gilded Age.

The book is presented as a series of aphorisms, meditating primarily on the painful nature of being alive, and how this is connected to other subjects, such as God, metaphysical exile, and decay.  Usage of aphorism  Cioran's decision to write entirely in aphorisms was a departure from his previously established writing style. On the Heights of Despair was composed of essays, each about a page each, which while different to most conventional philosophy, also separates it from The Trouble With Being Born. Speaking about his decision to write in such a manner, Cioran said he used aphorisms because \\"Explaining bores me terribly. When I've written aphorisms it's because I've sunk back into fatigue - why bother? And so, the aphorism is scorned by 'serious' people, professors look down upon it. When they read a book of aphorisms, they say, 'Oh, look what this guy said ten pages back, now he's saying the contrary. He's not serious.' I can put two aphorisms that are contradictory right next to each other. It's not at all gratuitous.\\" The Trouble With Being Born also makes direct reference to aphorisms. The book describes aphorisms as \\"Fire without flames. Understandable that no-one tries to warm himself at it.\\"  Reception  Writing for The Independent, Nicholas Lezard said \\"Why should we be interested in the opinions of this eccentric, who is, moreover, contradictory, perverse, resistant to intellectual theory and uninterested in questions of semiotics? Because Cioran actually makes his philosophy perfectly democratic, assimilable by anyone. Cioran's loathing is genuine, all- inclusive, and yet perversely generous (the book's second-last aphorism begins 'No one has loved the world more than I . . .', which might be a joke). Only someone so doubtful of the world's fundamental givens can be trusted. His scepticism lights things up like a torch.\\" In an issue of The Millions, Michael Robbins cited The Trouble With Being Born as one of his favourite books, and said \\"it's a pity Cioran and Weil never met.\\"  See also  * On the Heights of Despair * Emil Cioran * Antinatalism  References  Category:1973 non-fiction books Category:Works about antinatalism Category:Works about philosophical pessimism Category:Works by Emil Cioran ","title":"The Trouble with Being Born (book)"},{"id":"65333070","text":"Lieutenant-General Sir John Stokes, (1825 ‚Äì 17 November 1902) was a British Army officer heavily involved in the success of the running of the Suez Canal Company.

Educated at Rochester Proprietary School and at the Royal Military Academy, he passed into the Royal Engineers in 1843. Two years later he left for South Africa, where he spent the first years of his career, taking part in the Xhosa Wars of 1845-47 and 1850-52 (later known as the seventh and eight Xhosa wars), for which he was mentioned in despatches. He was promoted to captain in 1854 and major in 1856.Debrett‚Ä≤s Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 1903 He led an Engineer corps during the Crimean War, and was present during the siege and fall of Sevastopol in 1855. The following year he was Her Majesty's Commissioner on the European Commission formed to open the mouth of the River Danube, and acted in that capacity for 15 years, during which time order was restored to the delta of the Danube, and the river at its mouth and for 100 miles inland was made navigable by larger ships. For his service he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1871, and the following year he was appointed to command the Royal Engineers in South Wales, and promoted to colonel. In 1873 he was again sent abroad, this time to Constantinople as a British member on the International Commission on Tonnage and the Suez Canal Dues. After the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the company running the canal soon found itself in financial difficulties. Traffic was below expectations after the canal was finished in 1871, and its manager Ferdinand de Lesseps therefore tried to increase revenues by re-interpreting the definition of tonnage allowed. The ensuing commercial and diplomatic activities resulted in the International Commission of Constantinople, establishing a specific kind of net tonnage and settling the question of tariffs in its protocol of 18 December 1873.Protocol of the Commission (in French) This was the origin of the Suez Canal Net Tonnage and the Suez Canal Special Tonnage Certificate, both of which are still in use today. Stokes had visited the canal to write up reports on its condition, and was considered instrumental in making the protocol be recognized in the ensuing years. He was knighted as a Knight Companion (KCB) of the Order of the Bath in 1877. In the following years he was member of an international commission to decide harbour dues for Alexandria, and in 1880 a member of the Royal Commission on Ship's Tonnage Measurement. During the early 1870s he was briefly in command of the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, and in 1881 he received a War Office appointment as Deputy Adjutant-General (DAG) for Royal Engineers at Army Headquarters ‚Äì a post which he held for five years.

It was sold in June 2011 to an unknown buyer for nearly four million dollars. Painting The painting features two lines of trees by a Flemish canal. The channel in the painting has been associated with the extant canal running between Bruges and Damme. The trees in the lefthand line are receding rhythmically to the background (the movement of the trees in the righthand line is barely perceivable). The receding trees are tilted in the direction opposite to where the perspective plunges. As in most of his pointillist oeuvre, Van Rysselberghe here combined the dappling colors applied in small dots of pointillism to (short) brushstrokes, which he used to paint the grass. Van Rysselberghe's attention to details is evident here, and his mastery in pointillism and choice of color makes this painting's surface vibrate and sparkle. The painting was sold to an unknown buyer on June 31, 2011 at Christie's in London, for GBP 2,617,250 (about $3,916,000 in 2020). References Sources * * L'Art Moderne, 13 March 1893. * O.

Of Georgian origin, she was originally a slave girl of Fath-Ali Shah's mother, Mahd-e Olya, after whose death, she rose to prominence. Biography Fath-Ali Shah's mother Mahd-e Olya had been responsible for running the household until her death. When she died, Fath-Ali Shah's wives were unable to choose a new head of the royal harem, and therefore requested Fath-Ali Shah to leave Golbadan Baji in charge of the household as she was resportedly familiar with the ways of her mistress. By choosing a concubine, Fath-Ali Shah's wives protected themselves from the perception of favouring one wife over another. Golbadan Baji therefore became head of the household pursestrings. According to contemporaneous sources, she fulfilled this task efficiently and with fidelity. Fath-Ali Shah was very impressed by Golbadan Baji's performance, and therefore married her as a sigheh, and gave her the honorific title (laqab) Khazen-ol-Dowleh. Even after marrying and giving birth to two sons (Fath-Ali Shah's 37th son Bahman Mirza Baha-ol-Dowleh; and his 42nd son Seyfollah Mirza) she still managed the harem's affairs and expenditures efficiently. According to contemporaneous sources, at Nowruz (the Iranian New Year), she chose gifts for the harem's residents, princes and notables including the governors of Iran's provinces. Golbadan Baji kept a detailed list of all expenditures and presents. She was well trusted by many inside and outside the harem. At the height of her influence, Golbadan Baji presided over the private treasury, the harem finances and the Shah's private funds whilst heading a host of women secretaries and accountants.

Enclosed with barbed wire and a chain-link fence, the military camp serves as a European Union ‚Äúhotspot‚Äù. It is described by Human Rights Watch as an open air prison. In August 2018, it was dubbed by the field coordinator of Doctors Without Borders \\"The worst refugee camp on earth\\", as reported by the BBC. \\"I have never seen, ever the level of suffering we are witnessing here every day\\" says Luca Fontana, MSF Lesbos coordinator (7'42) . Conditions have only degraded since then. The camp was built to accommodate around 3,000 people, however there were around 20,000 people living in the camp in summer 2020, among whom 6,000 to 7000 were children under the age of 18. Because of overcrowding, the camp has expanded into a nearby olive grove, known as \\"Moria jungle\\", where the living quarters are makeshift, typically made out of pallets and tarps. The migrants have cut down an estimated 5,000 olive trees, some of them centuries old, to use as firewood. The residents of the nearby village of Moria have complained of increased criminality, including break-ins, vandalism, and looting of houses. Moria is still functioning, as the refugee crisis is still ongoing. Every month, hundreds of refugees and migrants cross the Mediterranean sea and land in Moria. Visited in 2019, the camp was described as \\"the recreation of a concentration camp on European soil\\" by Jean Ziegler, vice-chairman of the committee of experts advising the UN Human Rights Council. On 8 September 2020, a fire badly damaged the camp of more than 12,000 asylum seekers, which may have been started deliberately to protest quarantine measures, that came after detecting positive COVID-19 cases in the camp. On 10 September, three Greek ships were sent to help shelter the migrants. By 10 September, the camp was almost completely destroyed. Most of the refugees were left homeless on the street. During protests demanding their evacuation Greek police fired tear gas at them. The Greek government maintains that that the fires were started deliberately by migrants protesting that the camp had been put in lockdown due to a Covid-19 outbreak amongst the migrants in the camp. On September 16, 2020, four Afghan men were formally charged with arson for allegedly starting the fire. Two other underage migrants allegedly involved in starting the fire were held in police detention on the mainland.

After an accident it was rebuilt with six cylinder engines, becoming the Alcor Duo-6. The name Alcor derived from Allan Lockheed Corporation. Design and development Apart from their engine cowlings the Duo-4 and the rebuilt Duo-6 had identical structures. They had ply-covered cantilever high wings which tapered outwards both in plan and thickness, built around two box spars. Their ailerons were inset. Both were powered by air-cooled Menasco engines within carefully streamlined cowlings. The Menascos were mounted horizontally, head to head, on the nose of the fuselage so their propeller shafts were much closer together than on most conventional twin-engined aircraft, producing handling generally nearer to that of a single-engined design. On the Duo-4 the tips of the two-bladed propellers could be as little as apart. The Duo-4 had Menasco C-4 and the Duo-6 , supercharged Menasco C-6S engines. The rectangular cross-section, ply-covered fuselage had a Cr/Mo structure. On the Duo-6 pilot and co-pilot sat side by side in an enclosed cockpit under the wing leading edge and the passenger cabin behind them, with two windows on each side, could be configured to hold four or six seats. Two separate baggage compartments provided a combined volume of . Entry was via a port side door. There is less detail about the lower-powered Duo-4 but it is recorded as a five place aircraft. The fuselage tapered to a conventional tail of rounded profile and plan. Like the wing the tail had wooden structure and ply covering. Its tailplane, mounted at mid-fuselage, was in-flight adjustable for trim. The Duos had conventional, fixed, split axle landing gear with axles and drag struts mounted on the fuselage centreline. On each side a long, near-vertical leg, equipped with a hydraulic shock absorber, joined the outer end of the axle to the forward spar. The wheels, fitted with brakes, were enclosed under spats. The first flight of the Duo-4 was in 1930, piloted by Frank Clarke, though there is some uncertainty about the Menasco sub-type used. By 18 March 1931 Menasco C-4s were fitted when it was flown from Muroc Dry Lake by E.L. Remelin. Later that month it was damaged by a wind gust and, though damage was slight, funding problems slowed the rebuild. Lockheed used the three year delay to fit C-6S engines which almost doubled the engine power. The first flight of the Duo-6 was in March 1934, piloted by Frank Clarke at Alhambra airport. Soon after, test flights were made with one propeller removed. The Duo-6 took off from an extended run, climbed at then performed a series of right- and left-handed wingovers, handling much like a single-engined aircraft despite the power asymmetry. In October 1934 U.S. regulations limited commercial use of single-engined passenger aircraft, offering the Duo-6 a market opportunity but it was damaged again in 1935 and Alcor concentrated on a new, low wing design with a similar engine layout, the Alcor C-6-1 Junior. thumb Specifications (Duo-6) thumb References Category:Twin-engined tractor aircraft Category:High-wing aircraft Category:1930s United States airliners ","title":"Alcor Duo"},{"id":"65333503","text":"Turkish military false flag operations include operations done by the Turkish army but blamed on Kurdish insurgents during the past decades.

It is scheduled to be released in 2021 for the PlayStation 5. It will be the ninth installment in the God of War series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology, the game will be set in ancient Norway and feature series protagonists Kratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only playable character, and his young son Atreus. The game is expected to kick off the events of Ragnar√∂k, a series of events that bring about the end of days and depict the deaths of the Norse gods in Norse mythology. Development A sequel to 2018's God of War was teased at the end of that game, with it ending with the impending Ragnar√∂k soon to happen, as well as a secret ending that showed a vision that the Norse god Thor would confront Kratos and Atreus. Although he did not officially announce a new game at the time, game director Cory Barlog confirmed that the 2018 installment would not be Kratos' last game, and it was later revealed that future games would continue to be set in the Norse environment and include Atreus. In April 2019, a teaser came in the form of a PlayStation 4 dynamic background theme; the side of Kratos and Atreus' boat had runes that translated to \\"Ragnar√∂k is coming\\". During the PlayStation 5 Showcase event on September 16, 2020, a new God of War was officially announced for a 2021 release on the PlayStation 5. The short teaser trailer did not officially reveal the name of the sequel, but just like the runes from the dynamic theme, the trailer stated that \\"Ragnar√∂k is coming\\". This led some sources to believe the title of the game to be God of War: Ragnar√∂k, though this has not been confirmed by Sony. The tagline implies that this will be the start of Ragnar√∂k in the God of War universe, which in Norse mythology is a series of events that bring about the end of days and deaths of the Norse gods.

Robert Pierson succeeded Gervase Bryan as rector of St Mary's, Oldswinford after the latter was ejected in 1662. He died in post and was buried in his churchyard.

The second coast guard ship to bear the name, it served in the third Cod Wars conflict between Iceland and the United Kingdom. Due to its sharp stern, Baldur could inflict heavy damage on British ships colliding with its stern section and knocked out three frigates during the conflict. History Baldur was built in Poland as a stern trawler for a fishing company in Dalv√≠k and arrived in Iceland in June 1974. A year later, the Icelandic government bought the ship to use as a science vessel. =Cod Wars= In December 1975, Baldur was transferred to the Icelandic Coast Guard and converted to an armed trawler to serve in the third Cod Wars conflict against the United Kingdom under captain H√∂skuldur Skarph√©√∞insson. Its main purpose was to cut the nets of British trawlers fishing inside the 200-nautical-mile (370-kilometre) exclusive fishery zone claimed by Iceland. To hinder the Icelandic Coast Guard, the United Kingdom deployed several frigates and tugboats to intercept the coast guard ships. On 12 February 1976, Baldur was chased by HMS Diomede before being rammed by the frigate, damaging both vessels. On 28 February, HMS Yarmouth collided with Baldur's stern, severly damaging the frigate's bow, and forcing her to leave the patrol area assisted by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service tug Rollicker. Yarmouth underwent repairs at Chatham, where she was fitted with a new bow section.Yarmouth (1976) On 10 March, after having evaded several collision attempts by the HMS Mermaid, Baldur collided Diomede and suffered moderate damage. On 26 March, HMS Galatea collided with Baldur's stern, damaging the frigate's bow. The following day, Baldur faced Diomede once again. This time the frigate was severly damaged after colliding with Baldur's stern, with over 6 meter long tear opening on its port side, knocking it out of the conflict. Following the collision, Galatea arrived at the scene with its guns manned and warned Baldur from further interacting with the British fishing fleet. Galatea, along with HMS Juno and the tugboat Lloydsman then chased Baldur until it reached the 12 nautical-mile exclusive zone. On 6 May, Mermaid, Galatea and the tugboat Statesman attemted to ram Baldur. After the Mermaid managed to hit Baldur, the traweler hit back with its stern, ripping up a 1.5 meter long hole on the frigates side. On 22 May, Baldur and HMS Eastburne where involved in a collision, damaging both ships. =Later career= On 24 May 1977, the ship was transferred to the Ministry of Fisheries. where it was renamed Haf√æ√≥r and retrofitted for research purposes under the Icelandic Marine & Freshwater Research Institute. In 1984, it was converted into a freezer trawler and leased to a shrimp processing in √çsafj√∂r√∞ur. In July 1988, the ship was caught illegally fishing inside the Greenland exclusive fishery zone. In 1990, a fishing company in √çsafj√∂r√∞ur bought the ship and renamed it Skutull √çS 180. It later served various companies until 2013. In 2020, the ship was sold for scrap.

They are a set of completely integrable nonlinear partial differential equations. Because they provide the simplest, most direct example of a resonant interaction, have broad applicability in the sciences, and are completely integrable, they have been intensively studied since the 1970s. Informal introduction The three-wave equation arises by consideration of some of the simplest imaginable non-linear systems. Linear differential systems have the generic form :D\\\\psi=\\\\lambda\\\\psi for some differential operator D. The simplest non-linear extension of this is to write :D\\\\psi-\\\\lambda\\\\psi=\\\\varepsilon\\\\psi^2. How can one solve this? Several approaches are available. In a few exceptional cases, there might be known exact solutions to equations of this form. In general, these are found in some ad hoc fashion after applying some ansatz. A second approach is to assume that \\\\varepsilon\\\\ll 1 and use perturbation theory to find \\"corrections\\" to the linearized theory. A third approach is to apply techniques from scattering matrix (S-matrix) theory. In the S-matrix approach, one considers particles or plane waves coming in from infinity, interacting, and then moving out to infinity. Counting from zero, the zero-particle case corresponds to the vacuum, consisting entirely of the background. The one-particle case is a wave that comes in from the distant past and then disappears into thin air; this can happen when the background is absorbing, deadening or dissipative. Alternately, a wave appears out of thin air and moves away. This occurs when the background is unstable and generates waves: one says that the system \\"radiates\\". The two-particle case consists of a particle coming in, and then going out. This is appropriate when the background is non-uniform: for example, an acoustic plane wave comes in, scatters from an enemy submarine, and then moves out to infinity; by careful analysis of the outgoing wave, characteristics of the spatial inhomogeneity can be deduced. There are two more possibilities: pair creation and pair annihilation. In this case, a pair of waves is created \\"out of thin air\\" (by interacting with some background), or disappear into thin air. Next on this count is the three-particle interaction. It is unique, in that it does not require any interacting background or vacuum, nor is it \\"boring\\" in the sense of a non-interacting plane-wave in a homogeneous background. Writing \\\\psi_1, \\\\psi_2, \\\\psi_3 for these three waves moving from/to infinity, this simplest quadratic interaction takes the form of :(D-\\\\lambda)\\\\psi_1=\\\\varepsilon\\\\psi_2\\\\psi_3 and cyclic permutations thereof. This generic form can be called the three-wave equation; a specific form is presented below. A key point is that all quadratic resonant interactions can be written in this form (given appropriate assumptions). For time-varying systems where \\\\lambda can be interpreted as energy, one may write :(D-i\\\\partial/\\\\partial t)\\\\psi_1=\\\\varepsilon\\\\psi_2\\\\psi_3 for a time-dependent version. Review Formally, the three-wave equation is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial B_j}{\\\\partial t} + v_j \\\\cdot abla B_j=\\\\eta_j B^*_\\\\ell B^*_m where j,\\\\ell,m=1,2,3 cyclic, v_j is the group velocity for the wave having \\\\vec k_j, \\\\omega_j as the wave-vector and angular frequency, and abla the gradient, taken in flat Euclidean space in n dimensions. The \\\\eta_j are the interaction coefficients; by rescaling the wave, they can be taken \\\\eta_j=\\\\pm 1. By cyclic permutation, there are four classes of solutions. Writing \\\\eta=\\\\eta_1\\\\eta_2\\\\eta_3 one has \\\\eta=\\\\pm 1. The \\\\eta=-1 are all equivalent under permuation. In 1+1 dimensions, there are three distinct \\\\eta=+1 solutions: the +++ solutions, termed explosive; the \\\\--+ cases, termed stimulated backscatter, and the -+- case, termed soliton exchange. These correspond to very distinct physical processes. One interesting solution is termed the simulton, it consists of three comoving solitons, moving at a velocity v that differs from any of the three group velocities v_1, v_2, v_3. This solution has a possible relationship to the \\"three sisters\\" observed in rogue waves, even though deep water does not have a three-wave resonant interaction. The lecture notes by Harvey Segur provide an introduction. The equations have a Lax pair, and are thus completely integrable. The Lax pair is a 3x3 matrix pair, to which the inverse scattering method can be applied, using techniques by Fokas. The class of spatially uniform solutions are known, these are given by Weierstrass elliptic ‚Ñò-function. The resonant interaction relations are in this case called the Manley‚ÄìRowe relations; the invariants that they describe are easily related to the modular invariants g_2 and g_3. That these appear is perhaps not entirely surprising, as there is a simple intuitive argument. Subtracting one wave-vector from the other two, one is left with two vectors that generate a period lattice. All possible relative positions of two vectors are given by Klein's j-invariant, thus one should expect solutions to be characterized by this. A variety of exact solutions for various boundary conditions are known. A \\"nearly general solution\\" to the full non-linear PDE for the three-wave equation has recently been given. It is expressed in terms of five functions that can be freely chosen, and a Laurent series for the sixth parameter. Applications Some selected applications of the three-wave equations include: * In non-linear optics, tunable lasers covering a broad frequency spectrum can be created by parametric three-wave mixing in quadratic (\\\\chi^{(2)}) nonlinear crystals. * Surface acoustic waves and in electronic parametric amplifiers. * Deep water waves do not in themselves have a three-wave interaction; however, this is evaded in multiple scenarios: ** Deep-water capillary waves are described by the three-wave equation. ** Acoustic waves couple to deep-water waves in a three-wave interaction, ** Vorticity waves couple in a triad. ** A uniform current (necessarily spatially inhomogenous by depth) has triad interactions. :These cases are all naturally described by the three-wave equation. * In plasma physics, the three-wave equation describes coupling in plasmas.

Due to her involvement in the Tupamaros guerrilla group, she was exiled to Sweden from 1978 until 2014, when she returned to Uruguay. In addition to her work as an author, translator, and journalist, Vald√©s has been active in the promotion of museum digitization.  Biography  Ana Luisa Vald√©s was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1953. As a teenager, she began studying to become a lawyer at the Instituto Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez School. However, at age 19 she was arrested for being a member of the Tupamaros, a left-wing urban guerrilla group. After being held as a political prisoner for four years by the military dictatorship, Vald√©s went into exile in Sweden in 1978. It was in Stockholm that Vald√©s began her professional life. She studied social anthropology at the Stockholm University. As an active member of the Uruguayan exile community in Sweden, she helped found the Editorial Nordan printing house, a project of the Comunidad del Sur anarchist collective. She also edited the Swedish- language publication √Ågora in the 1980s and '90s. In 1984, Vald√©s was chosen to join the leadership of Sweden's PEN Club, and she later participated in international projects on minority languages and literatures, translations, and literary rights for the organization. She was also selected as a member of the Swedish Arts Council. As a representative of Sweden, she traveled to Brussels to help draft language on the multicultural internet and digital democracy for the European Commission. In her writing career, Vald√©s has produced around a dozen books, including poetry, biography, and works on digital culture and democracy. Her first book, La guerra de los albatros, won first prize at a competition held by the Casa del Uruguay in Paris. Her narrative works El intruso and El navegante combine the autobiographical and the mythical, and feminism is fundamental to her literary work. However, it took her several decades to be ready to write a direct memoir of her early years, including her time as a political prisoner, which was published in 2008 in Swedish and in 2014 in Spanish. Vald√©s has also worked as a journalist for such publications as Brecha in Uruguay and Dagens Nyheter, Ordfront, and Feministiskt Perspektiv in Sweden. In 1996, she co-founded the digital magazine Ada, named for Ada Lovelace. She has also written from Gaza on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and she organized the first major gathering of Palestinian intellectuals in Oslo in 2011. In addition to her own writing, which she produces in both Spanish and Swedish, Vald√©s has translated a number of works between the two languages. Vald√©s has also specialized in the digitalization of museum collections and cultural heritage, organizing seminars and curating expositions in Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East.

The Oxford English Dictionary added a standalone entry for \\"Kiev, n.\\" in December 2019, citing the name of the city as \\"Kiev (now also Kyiv).\\" English-language Wikipedia renamed its article about the city from Kiev to Kyiv on September 16, 2020 (). As a prominent city with a long history, its English name was subject to gradual evolution. The spelling Kiev was derived from the Old East Slavic form (Cyrillic: ).The form () is used in old Rus' chronicles like Lavretian Chronicle (, ; , 'Kievans'), Novgorod Chronicles and others. The name is associated with that of Kyi (), the legendary eponymous founder of the city. Early English sources used various names, including Kiou, Kiow, Kiew, Kiovia. On one of the oldest English maps of the region, published by Ortelius (London, 1570) the name of the city is spelled Kiou. On the 1650 map by Guillaume de Beauplan, the name of the city is Kiiow, and the region was named K√øowia. In the book Travels, by Joseph Marshall (London, 1772), the city is called Kiovia. Originally published: London, J. Almon, 1773, . The form corresponds to Russian orthography and pronunciation , during a time when Kiev was in the Russian Empire (from 1708, being the seat of the Kiev Governorate).

Griffiths stabbed Gould after she ended their relationship of three months. Griffiths was subsequently charged with Gould's murder, and pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court, where he was sentenced in November 2019 to life imprisonment with a minimum term of twelve-and-a-half years in custody before becoming eligible for parole. Because of his age at the time of sentence the law prevented him from receiving a whole life tariff. A campaign launched by Gould's friends to have self-defence lessons taught in schools was debated in Parliament, and an education minister agreed to issue guidelines for schools wishing to hold self-defence classes. Gould's mother, Carole, subsequently campaigned to have the law changed to enable young offenders to be treated more like adults when convicted of serious crimes, such as murder. Her campaign for \\"Ellie's Law\\" led to the presentation of a Sentencing White Paper by Robert Buckland, the Secretary of State for Justice, to the House of Commons on 16 September 2020. Biography Born on 6 February 2002, Ellie Gould was the daughter of Matthew and Carole Gould, and lived with her family in Calne, Wiltshire. At the time of her death she was a Year Twelve student at Hardenhuish School in Chippenham, and was studying for her A Levels. A keen horse rider, she participated in local equestrian events, as well as competing in cross country. She had ambitions to join the mounted police. Gould celebrated her 17th birthday in early 2019. In January of that year she began dating Thomas Griffiths, a prefect and fellow A Level student at her school, whom she had known since they were in Year Seven. Gould's mother has commented that her husband \\"wasn't overly keen\\" on Griffiths \\"because he didn't say much\\", but she assumed this aspect of his character was just down to his age. As Gould's exams approached, she wanted to focus on her studies, and felt the relationship was not right for her, so ended it in early May. Gould said that she felt suffocated by Griffiths's attention, and on the night before her murder, told friends he had not taken the split well. Murder On 3 May 2019, Griffiths, of Derry Hill, Wiltshire, was dropped off at school by his mother. After emailing his teachers to tell them he was feeling unwell, he walked to Chippenham bus station where he caught a bus back to Derry Hill, before returning home. His mother also returned home, and after hiding in the wardrobe of his bedroom so that she would not discover him absent from school, and waiting for her to depart again, he took the keys to a silver Ford Focus and drove to Gould's house. Following an argument, Griffiths attempted to strangle her, then used a knife he had taken from the family kitchen to stab her in the neck 13 times. Griffiths spent an hour at the house attempting to clean up the crime scene, using clothes to do this which he placed in a plastic bag, then returned home. After changing, he put his clothes in the washing machine, then dumped the bag in a local woodland. A neighbour saw him returning from the woods and drove him back to school, where he was subsequently collected by his mother. Later that day he sent text messages to friends indicating that he and Gould were going away on a break together, and to Gould's phone asking her if they could meet. Gould's body was discovered by her father at 3pm that afternoon. Arrest and legal proceedings Wiltshire Police arrested Griffiths on suspicion of murder at 6pm on 3 May, outside a friend's house in Calne, and he was taken to Melksham police station to be held for questioning. Evidence was gathered from Griffiths's mobile phone and CCTV cameras tracking his movements, and a neighbour who saw someone matching his description outside Gould's house. He initially denied involvement in Gould's death, claiming that he had arranged to go to her house so the pair could study together. Police then matched blood on his trainers with Gould, and he was charged with her murder. Griffiths was charged with murder on 6 May, and appeared before Salisbury Magistrates Court the following day. He appeared at Bristol Crown Court on 9 May, where a provisional trial date was set for 28 October. He did not enter a plea, and was remanded in custody. At a plea hearing on 29 August 2019, Griffiths pleaded guilty to Gould's murder, and was remanded in custody to await sentence. Recorder Peter Blair QC also lifted reporting restrictions that prevented Griffiths being named by media outlets, describing his crime as \\"extremely grave\\". Griffiths's sentencing hearing took place on 8 November, where Richard Smith QC spoke for the prosecution and Sasha Wass represented the defence. The court was told that Griffiths had argued with Gould prior to her death, and that a post mortem showed pressure applied to her neck had incapacitated her. There was evidence to suggest that after the murder he had placed the knife in Gould's left hand in an attempt to make it appear as though she had inflicted the injuries on herself. It was also said that Griffiths claimed to not remember the events of what had happened, and tried to explain marks on his neck as being from self- harm, but that they were more likely to be a result of his \\"young victim fighting for her life\\". A letter written by Griffiths to the court was read out, in which he expressed \\"heartfelt remorse\\" for his actions: \\"I'm so sorry. I know my apologies and explanations will never be enough but I hope in time I can show how truly sorry I am\\". He also claimed his \\"mental health was not good\\" at the time of the murder. Sentencing Griffiths, Judge Mr Justice Garnham described his actions as a \\"frenzied knife attack\\" and \\"the most appalling act\\" on a \\"vulnerable young woman in her own home where she should have been safe...The effects of your actions have not only snuffed out the life of this talented girl... but loaded pain on her friends and family\\". But it was ruled that the murder was not premeditated because Griffiths did not take the weapon with him. Griffiths was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of twelve-and-a-half years, before he is eligible for parole. Because of his age, the law prevented him from receiving a whole life tariff. Aftermath and Ellie's Law Gould's funeral was held on 29 May at St Mary's Church, Calne. The service was attended by family and friends. Following Griffiths's sentence, the case was subsequently referred to the Attorney General's office under the unduly lenient sentences scheme, but on 6 December 2019 it was announced that it could not be referred to the Court of Appeal because the law prevents people under the age of 21 from being given a whole life tariff. Speaking about the decision, Carole Gould described the legal process as a \\"crazy system\\" where those under the age of 18 \\"have the same starting point\\" as younger children: \\"There's a huge difference between a 10-year-old and an 18-year-old. And really, the laws need to be changed\\". Gould's friends began a campaign to have compulsory self-defence lessons taught in schools, feeling that basic knowledge of self-defence would have saved her life, and that it should be taught alongside subjects like swimming and road safety. The campaign was backed by James Gray, the MP for North Wiltshire, and on 12 March 2020, the matter was debated in the House of Commons. Vicky Ford, a junior minister with the Department for Education, ruled out making self-defence lessons compulsory for schools, but agreed to issue guidelines and ask headteachers if they felt self-defence classes were \\"right for their schools\\". She said the \\"balance of risk\\" was much clearer with things such as swimming and road safety, but that teaching self-defence relied very much on the \\"age and maturity\\" of pupils and their understanding that it could only be used in emergencies. Carole Gould subsequently campaigned for the introduction of \\"Ellie's Law\\" that would enable young offenders to be treated more like adults when convicted of serious crimes, such as murder. In August 2020, the Daily Telegraph reported that Robert Buckland, the Secretary of State for Justice, was reviewing the sentencing process, and considering a graded approach depending on the age of the offender. At the time, the case of Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, had also recently resulted in him not qualifying for a whole life tariff because he was 20 at the time of the bombing. On 16 September, Buckland presented the Sentencing White Paper to the House of Commons, which includes provisions to amend the law with regard to young offenders who commit serious crimes. The paper was criticised by Gould's family because the new law would not apply in the case of a defendant who did not take a weapon to the scene of a murder, such as Griffiths. Gould's parents subsequently wrote to Gray to request their daughter's name be removed from the proposals if they were not amended.

The painting was part of the Jan De Maere Gallery's collection up to 2003, and is today owned by a unknown collector. According to some sources, it was at the Dorotheum in 2007. Another better known Caritas Romana by de Crayer, dated to ca. 1625, is housed at the Museum of Prado in Madrid. Subject The subject matter of the painting is the exemplary episode of caritas as recounted by Valerius Maximus. In the story, part of Maximus' Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium,Book V, 5.4.7 Pero, the daughter of a Cimon, a starving man locked into a cell and awaiting execution, is allowed by the jailer to enter the cell and visit her father. Pero then decides to give the starving man her breast. Painting The scene depicted in the painting is set in Cimon's cell. Cimon, who occupies the center of the painting, is sitting with his hands tied and bound to the wall behind him, suckling at his daughter's breast. Pero is standing over her father, with her arm around his shoulder and her hand gently posed on his back. In de Crayer's 1625 Caritas, instead, Pero's hand kindly holds her father's head. Pero's expression in the 1645 painting is anxious, at the possibility of being caught by the guards rather than anything else.Gaspard DE CRAYER, Caritas Romana at Gallerie Jan de Maere In the painting, the focus is on the two protagonists and central figures, while de Crayer's powerful chiaroscuro nothing but enhances the drama of the scene.

With his diploma in electrical engineering from the prestigious university, he joined the staff of the Compagnie √âlectro-M√©canique at Lyon. In 1934, he became naturalised in France. World War II As a lieutenant in the artillery reserve forces, he was mobilised in August 1939 and saw service on the Italian front in Dauphin√©. He was demobilised in 1940 and resumed his work with CEM. In a boarding house where he took his meals, he met Abb√© Alexandre Glasberg, Nina Gourfinkel, and Raymond Winter, all engaged in clandestine actions. Abb√© Glasberg and Charles Lederman, representative of the ≈íuvre de secours aux enfants (OSE) in the southern zone, introduced him into the fort de V√©nissieux, which had been transformed into a camp to gather the 1,200 foreign Jews arrested on 26 August 1942 and destined for deportation. In 1942, with his brother-in-law Charles Lederman and Abb√© Alexandre Glasberg, he helped those who had been imprisoned in V√©nissieux under P√©tain‚Äôs ‚ÄúStatus of the Jews‚Äù. During the summer of 1942, the round-ups conducted in the Lyon region brought one thousand two hundred people deemed to be of Jewish race to V√©nissieux. On August 23, 1942, Georges Garel was part of the commission to \\"screen\\" these twelve hundred racial prisoners. The operation was staffed by the OSE, which acted as an alternate to the prison and police.

The following month, Joseph Weill, medical director of the OSE who was forced to subordinate himself to the Union g√©n√©rale des isra√©lites de France (UGIF, General Organization of Jews in France) and saw several of its shelters serve as targets for the raids, asked Georges Garel to set up an underground network to hide children under the age of sixteen under false identities and disperse them among the population and then if possible have them cross the Swiss border.Les R√©seaux Juifs √† vocation communautaire tr.

Georges Garel obtained from Cardinal Jules Sali√®ge, Archbishop of Toulouse (who read in the pulpit \\"The Jews are men [...] Not everything is allowed against them [...]\\") the authorization to place children, with false papers, in ecclesiastical institutions of the diocese of Toulouse. The ‚ÄúGarel circuit‚Äù was set up in January 1943. Support came from other Catholic organizations, then Protestant, secular, and even private initiatives.

Completed and commissioned in December 1943, she served in World War II, patrolling in the Pacific Ocean and taking part in the Marianas campaign, the Philippines campaign, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf before she was sunk in October 1944. Construction and commissioning I-45 was laid down on 15 July 1942 by the Sasebo Navy Yard at Sasebo, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 375. On 5 February 1943, she was renamed I-45 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District. She was launched on 6 March 1943 and completed and commissioned on 28 December 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, I-45 was attached formally to the Yokosuka Naval District and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups in the Iyo-nada in the Seto Inland Sea. She called at the Tokuyama Fuel Depot from 22 to 23 February 1944 to refuel. =First war patrol= On 25 March 1944, I-45 was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the 6th Fleet. She departed Kure that day to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Pacific Ocean east of the Marshall Islands. Alerted by Ultra intelligence information to the operations of and the submarines , , and between the Marshalls and Hawaii, United States Pacific Fleet Headquarters organized Task Group 11.1 ‚Äî a United States Navy hunter- killer group consisting of the escort aircraft carrier and the destroyer escorts , , , and ‚Äî on 30 March 1944 to find and sink them. The group‚Ä≤s first success against the submarines came at 14:08 on 4 April 1944, when a TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber and an FM-2 Wildcat fighter of Composite Squadron 66 (VC-66) from Altamaha flying west of the carrier spotted I-45 on the surface recharging her batteries northeast of Majuro. While the Wildcat strafed I-45, the Avenger attacked her with rockets and depth charges. I-45 suffered a direct hit on her stern and developed a serious leak. I-45‚Ä≤s commanding officer ordered her to go to full speed astern and dive. The aircraft crews last saw I-45 settling in a large oil slick with no forward momentum and received credit for sinking a submarine. I-45, meanwhile, submerged. When her commanding officer then ordered full speed ahead, her crew lost control of her and she began a rotating dive. She reached before her crew could stop her descent, and she finally stabilized at . Although she survived the attack, I-45 had suffered heavy damage, forcing her to return to Japan. She reached Yokosuka on 15 April 1944 and in late April began repairs at Kure Naval Arsenal which lasted until late May 1944. =Marianas campaign= On 12 June 1944, U.S. landings on Saipan began both the Battle of Saipan and the Marianas campaign, and on 13 June the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands. On 28 June 1944, I-45 departed Yokosuka in company with the submarine bound for Tinian in the Marianas and carrying an Unkato cargo container ‚Äî a submersible cargo container that could carry up to 377 tons of supplies, designed for a one-way trip in which the cargo‚Ä≤s recipients released, recovered, and unloaded it ‚Äî loaded with weapons and ammunition. Encountering heavy seas during her voyage, she was redirected to Guam to pick up Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service pilots who were stranded there. She attempted to contact Japanese forces ashore on Guam on both 14 and 16 July 1944 to deliver her Unkato and pick up the airmen, but failed on each occasion because of a communications mix-up. After the second failure, she dumped the Unkato container overboard and headed back to Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka on 27 July 1944, and later moved to Kure. =Second war patrol= The commander-in- chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, activated Operation Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1 for the defense of the Philippine Islands on 13 October 1944. I-45 departed Kure on the same day to begin her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Philippine Sea. U.S. forces landed on Leyte in the Philippines on 20 October 1944, beginning both the Battle of Leyte and the Philippines campaign, and the Japanese naval reaction to the invasion resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23‚Äì26 October 1944. On 24 October 1944, the second day of the battle, I-45 and the submarines , , , , and were designated Submarine Group A under the direct command of the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Miwa, and received orders to move to patrol station \\"Re\\" off the northeast coast of Mindanao. =Loss= On 29 October 1944, the destroyer escorts and were in the Philippine Sea steaming from San Pedro Bay in the Philippines to rejoin Task Unit 77.7.1 when Eversole picked up a doubtful sonar contact east of Dinagat Island at 02:10. She soon lost the contact, but at 02:28, two torpedoes struck her, causing her to lose all power and take on a 30-degree list. Her crew began to abandon ship at 02:40, and in less than 15 minutes Eversole sank stern-first at . I-45 surfaced at around 03:00 and circled the site of the sinking, briefly opening fire on survivors in the water with her Type 96 25mm antiaircraft gun. She dived at around 03:20. At 03:25 a large underwater explosion occurred, apparently from the sunken Eversole, killing about 30 survivors in the water and injuring others. The explosion alerted Richard S. Bull, which arrived on the scene and began a rescue operation while the destroyer escort , which had been detached from the screen of a passing fleet oiler unit, provided antisubmarine cover. By 06:30, Richard S. Bull had pulled the last of 139 survivors from the water, three of whom later died. Including them, Eversole‚Ä≤s crew suffered 77 dead in the sinking. Meanwhile, at 05:45 Whitehurst detected a submerged submarine ‚Äî probably I-45 ‚Äî on sonar northeast of Siargao, about from the site of Eversole‚Ä≤s sinking. After Whitehurst made three unsuccessful Hedgehog attacks, the submarine ‚Äî which Whitehurst‚Ä≤s commanding officer later described as displaying \\"excellent evasive tactics and maneuverability,\\" continually turning away from attacks and presenting her stern and wake to Whitehurst ‚Äî tried to escape at a depth of . At 06:48, Whitehurst conducted a fourth Hedgehog attack, which this time resulted in five or six small explosions, followed by a large underwater explosion that disabled Whitehurst‚Ä≤s sound gear and heavy rumbling noises. Whitehurst resumed her search for the submarine at 07:20 and noted a large amount of oil on the surface as well as wood and other debris, some of which her motor whaleboat recovered. She suspended her search at 12:15. The explosions, oil, and debris marked the sinking of the submarine, presumably I-45, at . The 6th Fleet issued orders to I-45 on 5 November 1944 to move to a new patrol area east of Lamon Bay, but she never acknowledged them. On 2 December 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-45 to be presumed lost off the Philippines with the loss of all 104 men aboard. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 March 1945.

Unsure of what he wanted to do following graduation, the younger Carroll was offered a job by his father to work for the Seattle Seahawks as a personnel assistant in the scouting department for one season before being named a defensive assistant in 2012. Initially offered a coaching position in Jacksonville by former Seahawks defensive coordinator and newly hired head coach Gus Bradley, Carroll was shifted to offensive assistant in 2013. He was a member of the coaching staff that defeated the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII, giving Carroll his first Super Bowl victory. He was promoted to assistant wide receivers coach in 2014, working with Kippy Brown and later Dave Canales. Carroll was promoted to wide receivers coach in 2018.  Personal life  Carroll's brother Brennan is currently the run game coordinator for the Seahawks. Carroll and his wife Anna have two sons.

He is considered one of the most reputable Spanish militaries of the last years of the reign of Philip II and the reign of Philip III. He held important positions in the navy and carried out several military operations in which he had to fight against English, Dutch, French and Barbary in the Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. It is known for the conquest of La Mamora in 1614. Because he belonged to a noble family, he had several appointments such as Adelantado de Murcia, Knight of the Order of Calatrava and Commander of Almuradiel. Biography Coat of arms of the House of Los V√©lez. =Family= He was the illegitimate son of Luis Fajardo y de la Cueva, 2nd Marquis of Los V√©lez, Grandee of Spain and 1st Marquis de Molina. His mother was Ana Ruiz de Avenda√±o y Alarc√≥n, a neighbor of V√©lez-Blanco and a native of Villapalacios, in La Mancha. Due to his illegitimate status, he did not have the same social status as the other children his father had previously had with his only deceased wife, Leonor Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. But then he would manage to ascend socially, due to the military prestige he would obtain during his naval career and the support of his influential paternal family, the House of Los V√©lez. On the maternal side, Luis would become the only son and heir of his mother. Later he would have achieved the recognition of his father, given the good relationship he had with him and the rest of his paternal family. This allowed him to establish matrimonial ties with another noble family. He married Luisa de Tenza, Lady of Espinardo, with whom he had three children. The marriage ties of his descendants, which he would manage, would also reinforce his social position, as well as that of his children, obtaining large possessions for his family in the Kingdom of Murcia. His eldest son was Alonso Fajardo de Tenza, who became governor and captain general of the Philippines in 1616. His second son was Juan Fajardo de Tenza, who accompanied his father in some military operations and also became an admiral, and was also governor of Galicia. He also had an only daughter named Menc√≠a Fajardo, who in 1609 married Juan Antonio Usodemar Narv√°ez, lord of the village of Alcantarilla, a fact that initially did not please her father. In addition to the three children he had with Luisa, he had an illegitimate son named Luis with a single woman. Little is known about this son, except that he accompanied his brother Alonso to the Philippines. =Early life= Luis Fajardo was born around 1556 in Murcia, twenty-three years after the death of his father's only wife, Leonor. From a very young age he entered the military career, accompanying his father along with his brother Diego to suppress the Alpujarras Revolt (1568‚Äì1571). At the beginning of 1569 he was the standard- bearer of the army led by his father, and in June of that year he was commissioned to defend Oria and Cantoria from the Moorish attack on the marquesado. During Eighty Years' War, Fajardo had to fight with the Dutch on several occasions. =Naval career= In 1593, Fajardo was under the command of Francisco Coloma, captain general of the Tierra Firme Navy (‚ÄúArmada de Tierra Firme‚Äù), participating in the transshipment of the silver left in the Azores Islands for Luis Alfonso de Flores, with his fleet of 12 ships. The following year he was an overseer of the Tierra Fime Navy and then succeeded Coloma in office. In 1597, he carried out an inspection in C√°diz together with the lawyer Diego Armenteros, due to the Anglo-Dutch sacking of that port the previous year. He was also appointed by the king to preside over the process against those responsible for this disaster. In 1598, Fajardo was appointed captain general of the Guard Navy (‚ÄúArmada de la Guardia de la Flota de Indias‚Äù), charged with bringing and protecting the Spanish treasure fleet from privateers on their way to Spain, a dangerous and vital job for the Spanish Empire. This will be his main mission until his death and for which he will obtain several honors from the king. In 1600, Fajardo sent a report to the king, stating the convenience of having galleys in Cartagena de Indias for any eventuality. Between 1601 and 1602, in his work to protect the Spanish treasure fleet, he had some battles against English fleet and even a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet, managing to successfully repel all these adversaries when they attacked him. In the battle against the combined fleet, which was 20 ships, superior to Fajardo's fleet of 7 ships, he managed to damage the flagship and capture the vice-flagship and a patache, at the cost of 200 casualties between killed and wounded. In one of these battles, the English commanders Richard Leveson and Wiliam Monson had joined forces to attack him, but were unsuccessful in their attempt. In November 1604, he was appointed captain general of the Ocean Sea Navy (‚ÄúArmada del Mar Oc√©ano‚Äù), replacing the late Admiral Alonso de Baz√°n. With this naval force he had the mission of protecting the Iberian coast of the Atlantic and the Strait of Gibraltar, also taking into account that it was the route of arrival of the Spanish treasure fleet. This led him to engagement the fleets of Dutch, English or French privateers on several occasions, even on the coasts of America. In 1605, Fajardo carried out with his fleet a punitive expedition to the Caribbean, more precisely in Araya, on the coasts of Cuman√° and the Margarita Island. In that place, he attacked by surprise a fleet of Dutch smugglers and privateers who were blocking the area and engaged in the illegal extraction of salt, destroying it completely. This fact affected the Dutch industry, which depended on the product for various uses. After the attack, he spent a brief time in the Caribbean chasing privateers before returning to Spain. The following year, he defeated the fleet of Dutch Admiral Willem Haultain at the Battle of Cape San Vicente, having done so with a makeshift fleet. This allowed lifting the blockade of the Spanish-Portuguese coast and the arrival of the Spanish treasure fleet. Drawing by an anonymous Spanish painter representing the place known as La Mamora in the 17th century. In 1607, his son Juan began to help him in the leadership of the Ocean Sea Navy. With the Pax Hispanica, Fajardo was frequently in the Spanish Levante, dedicating himself to dealing with the growing threat of Anglo-Barbary piracy in the Mediterranean. In May 1609 he gave a report to the king about the problems in the duration of the Spanish ships due to the defective cure. In June of that year, Fajardo commanded an expedition to the Barbary coast, to pursue the pirate Zymen Danseker. He arrived at the Tunisian coast, where he attacked the fortified anchorage of La Goulette, destroying and capturing all the ships in the place, which made clear the Spanish capacity to face the pirates. Then he collaborated with part of the fleet in the expulsion of the Moorish from Spain. In 1612, some 4 galleys of Fajardo's fleet captured the French privateer Jehan Philippe de Castelane's ship, which was carrying numerous manuscripts originally belonging to the Moroccan Sultan Muley Zidan. The manuscripts were not returned by the Spanish government and became part of the Royal Library of El Escorial, which in turn ruined relations between France and Morocco. In August 1614, Fajardo commanded an expedition of almost 100 ships with 5,000 landing soldiers, with whom he conquered La Mamora, a military action that earned him great prestige for the measures he took during the attack, and for which he had no casualties. The conquest of the place deprived Muley Zidan of a haven for pirates and prevented this strategic place from falling into Dutch hands. During the last years of his life he continued to serve in the Ocean Sea Navy and had some naval engagements along the Spanish Atlantic coast. Fajardo died on 21 May 1617, being succeeded by Don Fadrique de Toledo, 1st Marquess of Valdueza, in the command of the Ocean Sea Navy.

Early life and education  Christie was born in New York and lived in Denver, Colorado from age 3. She and her mother moved to Charlotte, North Carolina when she was 10. Christie enjoyed history from a young age and easily memorized dates and facts. She considers Black Southern trends as having sparked her interest in fashion, such as the tall tees and jersey dresses associated with crunk culture. She also cited 106 & Park, Jet, Ebony, as early influences. She names Mildred Blount as her favorite designer. Christie received her bachelor's degree from North Carolina A&T; State University in race, history, and culture. As of September 2020, she is completing her master‚Äôs degree in costume studies at New York University.  Career  Christie previously interned at W and InStyle. After college, she worked as a digital marketing and sales planner at Vogue. She credits that position with her learning how to use Twitter to write long threads in short pieces, detailing specific parts of fashion history. She intentionally uses AAVE, memes, and colloquial speech in her threads to challenge rhetorical norms related to academia. Her viral threads include Arthur McGee, the first Black designer who worked on 7th Avenue, and a thread about Josephine Baker‚Äòs film career. Christie specializes in information about fashion history at the intersections of race and culture. Her stated goal is to share the contributions of Black designers in fashion history. Christie also seeks to credit Black designers' historic contributions to fashion that are not widely known, such as the work of designer Felicia Farrar. She also advocates for structural changes to address the low numbers of Black leadership in the industry. She partnered with Netflix to do a fashion thread for Beyonc√©'s Homecoming. She also hosted an Instagram Live where she interviewed Zerina Akers, the costume designer for Black Is King, which had approximately 16,000 viewers. = Accolades = * 2020 - Dazed, Dazed 100  References   External links  * Official website Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:21st-century African-American women Category:African-American historians Category:People from Charlotte, North Carolina Category:North Carolina A&T; State University alumni ","title":"Shelby Ivey Christie"},{"id":"65334642","text":"Portrait of a Lady is an oil on canvas painting by Flemish painter Gaspar de Crayer.

It was the second squadron to bear the designation VF-18. Over the course of two and a half months of strike operations from 6 September to 25 November 1944, Fighting 18 provided air support for the amphibious invasion of Peleliu; fought in the last major air battle in the Pacific; and shared responsibility for locating and launching the first strikes against the Imperial Japanese Navy's primary battleship fleet during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Upon returning to the United States, Fighting 18 was widely mentioned in the press for its success in combat and subsequently given the nickname 'Two-a-Day 18' for the number of enemy aircraft its pilots destroyed. The squadron's leading ace and the Navy's second-highest scoring fighter pilot, Cecil Harris, also received significant press attention. Fighting 18 is recognized today as the fourth-highest scoring Grumman F6F Hellcat squadron of World War II.  Background  Fighting Squadron 18 was established on 5 March 1944. Previously designated VF-36 and intended for land-based duty, the squadron was slotted into Air Group 18 during training in Hawaii since Dive Bombing and Torpedo Bombing Squadron 18 were without an accompanying fighting squadron. The completed air group boarded USS Intrepid on 16 August 1944. Operational history VF-18 Skipper Ed Murphy and XO Clarence Blouin = September = Intrepid operated as part of Task Group 38.2, one of four carrier groups under the overall command of Admiral William Halsey Jr. Strike operations commenced 6 September 1944 against Babelthuap, the largest island in the Palau archipelago. By the morning of 8 September there were no remaining targets of value, so Intrepid moved due west to Mindanao to launch strikes on the island's largest city, Davao City. Throughout this period, combat was characterized by fighter-bomber missions and bomber escort. Only a few enemy planes rose in opposition to the initial strikes on the Palaus and Mindanao, including one Mitsubishi Ki-46 \\"Dinah\\" reconnaissance aircraft shot down on 10 September by Harvey P. Picken and William H. Murray. VF-18 aircraft were damaged during these line periods but neither planes nor pilots were lost. The intensity of strike operations‚Äîboth in terms of pace and ferocity‚Äîincreased markedly as Intrepid sent planes northward to the Visayas. An enemy convoy was attacked on 12 September and the first real air combat was joined the next day over Negros Island. Eight Japanese fighters were claimed shot down by the squadron. Four of these were credited to Cecil Harris, making him the squadron's first ace. Fighting 18 also suffered its first pilot killed in action (KIA) on 13 September when Lt. James B. Neighbours had the tail of his Hellcat blown off by anti-aircraft fire. On 17 September, Intrepid returned to the Palaus to launch strikes on Angaur and Peleliu in support of Marine landings. Fighting 18 experimented with the use of napalm bombs made out of empty belly fuel tanks, but these proved ineffective. Aircraft Action Reports from the Palaus and Visayas and reminiscences in the squadron's War History show that the Japanese were being rapidly overwhelmed in these areas: > \\"COMTHIRD Fleet characterized the enemy's non-aggressive attitude as > \\"unbelievable and fantastic.\\" ...thus far there has been no evidence of Jap > retaliation for our attacks on them.\\" These observations, along with reports from Thomas Cato Tillar Sr., an aviator aboard USS Hornet (CV-12), led Allied powers to advance their timetable for the invasion of Leyte from the end of the year to 20 October 1944. The ensuing change of pace caught the Japanese off-guard. On the morning of 21 September, TG 38.2 launched the first carrier strike against central Luzon since the fall of the Philippines. No enemy aircraft were encountered early on due to the element of surprise, but Japanese fighter aircraft were scrambled to heavily contest the rest of the day's strikes. Twenty-five Japanese planes were claimed shot down by VF-18 over the course of the day. One pilot assigned to photo-reconnaissance, Lt.(jg) Charles Mallory, was credited with shooting down five Japanese planes, making him an ace-in-a-day. When he returned to Intrepid, his plane captain counted 67 bullet holes in his Hellcat. Overall, operations on 21 and 22 September were considered \\"extremely effective\\" by Vice Admiral George D. Murray, commander of the Navy's Pacific air forces. = October = On 1 October 1944 Admiral Gerald Bogan and his staff came aboard Intrepid, designating it the flagship of Task Group 38.2. After proceeding to refuel and re-provision at Ulithi, TG 38.2 returned to combat operations on 10 October using a typhoon to cover the ships' approach to the Ryukyu Islands. The ensuing strikes were the first launched against the Ryukyus during the war. As with the strikes against Luzon the previous month, these caught the Japanese by surprise. VF-18 activity included a fighter sweep over Okinawa Island, participation in full air group strikes, and photo reconnaissance. Shipping and airfields in the vicinity were seriously damaged or destroyed with virtual impunity. The Imperial Japanese Navy responded to this sudden attack by implementing their plan for a decisive battle with Allied naval forces, starting with the activation of their remaining air forces.  Formosa  Skipper Ed Murphy briefs his pilots before a strike On 12 October, TG 38.2 launched fighter sweeps over northern Formosa to destroy Japanese air power in advance of the amphibious invasion of the Philippines. The Japanese were on alert after carrier strikes on the Ryukyus and responded by committing hundreds of aircraft to protect the island's air bases and to destroy Halsey's carriers. Fighting 18's youngest pilot, Arthur Mollenhauer, shot down five Japanese planes in rapid succession during his first encounter with the enemy. The newly christened ace was interviewed aboard Intrepid by Baltimore Sun war correspondent Philip Heisler and Honolulu Star-Advertiser reporter Ray Coll, and had his likeness and story printed in newspapers nationwide. Cecil Harris destroyed four Japanese planes and helped fellow pilot Egidio DiBatista escape an attack by enemy fighters. DiBatista was forced to bail out of his damaged aircraft close to the fleet. Though he broke his leg during the fall, he ultimately survived the mission. Harris and Mollenhauer had their picture taken the following day by an Associated Press photographer. Their combined nine victories earned them features in newspapers around the country. Despite this success, the squadron also suffered significant losses over Formosa. Fighting 18 was assigned to fly low cover during the morning's sweep, which meant it was the first squadron to bomb targets on the ground. As a result, pilots were exposed to the full force of ground-based anti-aircraft fire and left at an altitude disadvantage against Japanese fighters attacking from above. Fighting was so fierce that returning pilots recalled seeing parachutes opening throughout the engagement as more and more planes were destroyed. In addition to DiBatista, three other VF-18 pilots were shot down: Ralph DuPont, Isaac Keels and William Ziemer. DuPont and Keels were ultimately ruled KIA; Ziemer died in a Japanese prison camp less than two weeks before the announcement of Japan's surrender. A fourth pilot, Harry Webster, ran out of fuel near the task group and was forced to make a water landing. He was unable to escape his sinking plane and drowned. The air battle continued over the course of the next four days. In addition to strike missions against Formosa itself, pilots assigned to combat air patrol (CAP) turned back wave after wave of attack by Japanese bombers. On 14 October in particular, VF-18 pilots rebuffed an attack by approximately 30 enemy aircraft. Squadron members were credited with a total of 23 Japanese planes shot down. Three of these were claimed by Cecil Harris, making him one of the country's leading aces with 13 enemy planes to his name.  Battle of Leyte Gulf  Admiral Kurita's battleship force under attack by carrier aircraft Fighting 18 next attacked airfields in northern Luzon on 18 October. Theses strikes were designed to suppress what was left of Japanese air power while Allied troops secured the small islands at the mouth of Leyte Gulf. That same day, Admiral Takeo Kurita sortied with his battleship force to oppose the nascent Allied invasion of the Philippines. He was spotted the night of 23 October by submarines and , beginning the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The next morning at 0600, Admiral Bogan sent out sector searches to locate Kurita's battleship force. A team from Intrepid which included VB-18 pilot Russell \\"Max\\" Adams and rear seater Cornelius Clark, as well as Fighting 18 pilots Donald Watts and Charles Amerman, was the first to successfully spot, identify and broadcast information about Kurita's forces. Watts sent the message that ultimately reached Halsey: \\"13DD, 4BB, 8CA off the south tip of Mindoro, course 050, speed 10 to 12 knots. No train or transports.\\" With this information in Hand, Halsey gave Bogan the order, \\"Strike repeat Strike. Good luck.\\" Bogan's TG 38.2 was at that moment the weakest of the four carrier groups, with only one fleet carrier (Intrepid) and one light carrier () available to contribute aircraft. It was however the only carrier group close enough to immediately launch aircraft. As a result, the first two strikes against Admiral Kurita's forces were composed entirely of planes from Intrepid and Cabot. Fighting 18 pilots escorted bombers through intense anti-aircraft fire and strafed enemy ships to draw gunfire. Later in the day, after dealing considerable damage to Admiral Kurita's forces, Halsey received word of a Japanese carrier force to the north. The decision was made to bring the full strength of his forces north to engage the IJN's flattops. Intrepid was designated the battle-line carrier for the ensuing operations. VF-18 aces Charles Mallory (left) and Cecil Harris (right) On the morning of 25 October, Fighting 18 pilots once again escorted bombers on sector searches to locate Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa's carrier force. Searches for the main force were negative, though VF-18 pilot Frederick Wolff located and bombed a separate group of destroyers. Full strikes from Intrepid and other carriers arrived around 0830 over Ozawa's forces. VF-18 pilots recorded 1 near miss (Donald Watts) and 2 probable hits (Charles Amerman, Richard Cevoli) on a light carrier as well as 1 hit (Frederick Tracy) on the IJN's last remaining carrier veteran of Pearl Harbor, Zuikaku. Though a second strike was ready, the urgent messages reaching Admiral Halsey from Task Force 77 caused him to break off his battleships with Intrepid again as the battle-line carrier. This force sped south to try to catch Admiral Kurita as he once more retreated through San Bernardino Strait. Halsey's battleships arrived after midnight, too late to engage Kurita's fleeing forces. Intrepid was able to launch one strike that reached Kurita before his ships moved out of range. Fighting 18 pilots strafed and bombed enemy vessels but inflicted only slight damage. Replacement pilot Harold Meacham was lost sometime during this strike. At the end of the battle, VF-18 and its air group had participated in five strikes, including the first and last launched over the course of the multi-day engagement.  The First Kamikazes  VF-18 Hellcat prior to launch on 29 October 1944 Fighting 18 and Intrepid remained in the Leyte area through 28 October, providing strategic support for the invasion of Leyte. VF-18 pilot George Griffith was killed on this date when his engine quit on takeoff, causing his plane to fall into the path of the ship. Afterward, Intrepid moved north to strike Luzon. Kamikaze tactics had recently been officially introduced by Japan, turning all available airfields in the Philippines into credible threats against Allied naval forces. As a result, a concerted effort was made starting 29 October to destroy Japanese planes on the ground and to render these fields inoperable. Though the morning fighter sweep over Bulan field did not find targets of value, strikes on Clark Field on 29 October were met with fierce resistance by dozens of Japanese fighters. Unlike reports of previous encounters denigrating the skill and fighting spirit of Japanese pilots, an action report from 29 October states, \\"The Japs were aggressive and seemed much better tacticians than enemy pilots previously encountered.\\" Japanese aircraft in these engagements also included later model, better protected and more heavily armed fighter types, like the Mitsubishi J2M, nicknamed \\"Jack\\" by the Allies. At 1204, a Japanese plane intentionally dove on Intrepid. The plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire on the way in, scattering flame and debris across Gun Tub #10. The impact and ensuing fires killed 10 members of the gun crew and burned others. Afterward, Admiral Bogan aboard Intrepid decided to move his ships into an oncoming squall to prevent further attack by Japanese air forces. VF-18 pilot Robert Hurst flew the first and last strikes of the day, shooting down a combined five enemy planes to become an ace-in-a-day. Cecil Harris scored four. On afternoon CAP, Robert Davis was vectored out to a bogie by Intrepid fighter director officer Bill \\"Jeep\\" Daniels. Davis found the aircraft, an Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bomber, and shot it down before a difficult return to the ship through \\"the most severe wall of rain\\" he had ever seen. Three VF-18 pilots were lost over the course of the day. Daniel Naughton and Arthur Mollenhauer were both shot down during the day's first strike. Naughton ultimately made it to friendly forces in the Philippines, but Mollenhauer was never seen again. William Thompson, on the third strike of the day, and James Hedrick, on CAP with Robert Davis, were unable to find Intrepid through the storm mentioned above. Both pilots were forced to make water landings; neither were ever found. = November = By November, Fighting 18 was \\"depleted and exhausted\\" after two months of continuous operations. The squadron continued to fly anti-kamikaze CAP and SNASP missions, and lightly-contested strikes against targets on Luzon. Encounters with enemy aircraft were fewer and the quality of remaining Japanese pilots lower. Though some VF-18 pilots were shot down in November, including Charles DeMoss and James Newsome, they were all later reported safe with Allied forces. On 4 November, air group commander (CAG) William Edward Ellis took over as Intrepid's Air Officer. He was replaced as CAG the following week by Wilson M. Coleman, who was previously in command of Fighting Squadron 13 aboard . Coleman had witnessed damage done to Franklin by kamikaze attacks in October. As a result, he instituted a policy aboard Intrepid that all air group personnel clear squadron ready rooms during general quarters and relocate to wardrooms below the ship's armored hangar deck. Impact of kamikaze on USS Intrepid Intrepid suffered serious damage as a result of two back-to-back kamikaze attacks on 25 November 1944. The attacks occurred just prior to 1300, as Intrepid was launching its third strike of the day. VF-18 pilot Charles Mallory was in the cockpit of his Hellcat in the hangar deck when general quarters alarms sounded. Though flight operations were suspended, he refused to turn off his engine and convinced plane handlers to help him reach the flight deck. He recalled being the last pilot to take off from Intrepid before the first kamikaze struck. None of the men of Fighting 18 were killed in the ensuing blasts, though the squadron's Air Combat Intelligence Officer, Harry Cropper, suffered second degree burns to his face and extremities. The attacks ultimately claimed the lives of 69 officers and men aboard Intrepid. Due to the significant damage to their ship, VF-18 pilots from the day's second strike were forced to land on other nearby carriers, including and . Pilots on the more recently launched third strike were able to fly out to Leyte, where they could stay overnight before returning to the fleet anchorage at Ulithi. Despite efforts on the part of its members and affiliated command staff to keep the whole air group together, on 30 November 1944 VF-18 was detached from Air Group 18 to be retained in theater aboard . The squadron was disestablished on 20 December 1944. Reformation On 25 January 1945, after VF-18's veterans received their allotted home leave, the squadron was reformed at Naval Air Station Astoria in Oregon. Twenty-four pilots who had been with VF-18 aboard Intrepid returned to the squadron. According to the squadron's War History, \\"It is generally believed that this was the highest percentage of combat experienced pilots with any reformed squadron.\\" Newly graduated cadets were folded in for training, which brought the squadron from Astoria to NAS San Diego in April. In May, VF-18 qualified during day carrier operations aboard USS Ranger (CV-4), and in August 1945 they received the first complement of Grumman F8F Bearcat fighters to replace their F6F Hellcats. Less than one month later the war officially ended, leading to the disestablishment of VF-18. Legacy The squadron's return from the front was heralded in the press with headlines like \\"Crack Carrier Squadron Rests\\" and \\"Much Decorated Squadron Home.\\" Cecil Harris went on a publicity tour to Grumman's Bethpage facility and the Museum of Science and Industry in New York City. Today, the exploits of Fighting Squadron 18 are incorporated into displays at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, in the hangar deck of the decommissioned aircraft carrier. Cecil Harris has a plaque dedicated to him at Patriots Point and a statue at his alma mater, Northern State University.

It is part of Contra Costa County. Its coordinates are . According to the 2000 US Census, the population of Bradford Island was 48, but by 2013, that number had declined to 13.  Geography and ecology  Bradford Island is part of the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta. It is bounded by the San Joaquin River, False River, and the Bradford Island canal/slough, and is accessible only by ferry from Jersey Island, which is to its south; it has scenic views of Mount Diablo. It is below sea level, and is protected from flooding by levees. As a reclaimed wetland, Bradford Island has rich peat soil (used to grow wheat). It is one of eight islands in the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River delta considered \\"critical\\" to the region's water quality by the California Department of Water Resources, as it prevents saltwater intrusion into the Delta.  Levees  The of levees around Bradford Island are administered by Reclamation District 2059. On December 9, 1983, a storm caused a breach in the levees, flooding the island completely. On August 27, 2009, additional levee damage occurred when a freighter ran aground on the north side of the island, causing of damage to the rock base and washing out a section of the levee (requiring $800,000 in repairs done by the Coast Guard). While 100 people were planned to be evacuated from the island the day after, deputies found only nine, of whom eight refused to leave ‚àí the single evacuee was taken by boat to nearby Bethel Island for the night. In 2015, during a District levee inspection, goats were found to be \\"running rampant\\" on the levee crown, slopes and neighboring properties, potentially contributing to levee erosion. As District policy forbids goats on the levees, landowners were encouraged to contact Bradford Reclamation District with any sightings of, or information in connection to, goats on the levees. In 2018, emergency repairs were conducted on the levees due to seepage. Holes were repaired with steel sheet piles, for an estimated cost of $200,000.  History and politics  In 1986, the decommissioned minesweeper was purchased by William Gardner, a scrap metal dealer, and brought to his residence on Bradford Island. Lucid, an oceangoing wooden ship that had seen use in the Vietnam War, was used as a floating warehouse. Gardner removed or sold everything of value from the ship, and used it as a storage building, cutting a hole in the hull on the port side near the waterline to use as a door. He was murdered over a property dispute in 2004. In 2005, his widow donated the ship to United States Navy veteran Mike Warren, whose \\"Save an MSO Foundation\\" began restoration by removing the large amount of scrap metal that had been stored in it and patching the hole. In 2011, the ship was moved to the Stockton Maritime Museum to be restored for use as a museum ship. In 2010, a fire charred hundreds of acres of land and ignited peat vegetation. As Bradford Island had not been annexed to any Contra Costa County fire district, the fire was not suppressed, and it caused an estimated $675,000 in property damage. The board of Reclamation District 2059 has been the subject of controversy. In 2006, majority landowner Paul Sosnowski successfully petitioned the district to expand its board from three to five members. He and his girlfriend were elected to the additional seats. They subsequently gifted one percent of a single parcel to a maintenance worker at Sosnowski's marina, Steve Lucas, who then became a landowner eligible for board membership; Sosnowski's ownership of large amounts of the island permitted him to cast thousands of votes (one per acre owned) and elect Lucas to the board. Sosnowski intended to use his absolute majority to develop various businesses on the island. In the summer of 2017, it was discovered that part of Sosnowski's land had been underwater, leaving him 3.6 acres short of majority ownership; he was removed from the board as a result.

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a Shepard kneeling in a field while dreaming of nude women.  Description  Ferdinand Hodler painted Dream in 1896. Unlike his previous, more realist works, Dream shows Hodler's interest in Symbolist paintings. Dream was first shown during the Swiss national exhibition in Geneva. Sources have commented that Hodler's submittance of Dream to the 1896 exebition was possibly done to provoke the Swiss art community, noting that Hodler's rendering of copious nude figures in the painting may have been influenced by rejections of his earlier works as being too sexual. In addition, Hodler debuted the painting at the Th√©√¢tre du Sapajou in Geneva, possibly an intentional choice given the theater was associated with satire. According to the Met's description of Dream, the painting and situation surrounding its debut earned Hodler \\"considerable\\" notoriety. The painting was originally owned by the Kunsthandlung Rath in Basel before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s.

Her family home was Kelly House in the village of Kelly, Devon.  Early life  Kelly House and church, Kelly, Devon. Home of Mary Kelly Mary Kelly was born at Salcombe vicarage in Devon on 25 March 1888 to the Reverend Maitland Kelly and his second wife Elfreda Blanche Carey. She was educated at home by a governess and at school at The Halsteads in East Sheen, London. During World War 1 she worked as a cook in a VAD hospital in Exeter and as a clerk in the War Office. After the war she returned home to Kelly House.  Career  Theatrical performances were part of life at Kelly House and Kelly founded the Village Drama Society in January 1919 after seeing how much enjoyment the productions of the Kelly Players brought to those who took part; these productions included people from all parts of society regardless of their class or age, such as farm labourers. Kelly was aware of the social changes occurring during the first decades of the twentieth century. In her book Village Theatre she charted the social change in villages as a result of mechanisation, the growth of materialism in the nineteenth century and from the war. These changes included the reduced power and wealth of the gentry, the waning of the influence of the church, the growth of the Women's Institutes (WI) improved education, the advent of radio and cinema, better bus services, and awareness of health and housing. Kelly was also aware that during the war men had travelled and become acquainted with theatre companies such as Lena Ashwell's touring company. With her enthusiasm for rural drama she traced the origins, history and state of village and rural theatre and entertainment in Britain and Europe citing the Oberammergau Passion Play as a genuine piece of community drama. After the formation of the Kelly Drama Society other Village Drama Societies started to form and Kelly was called upon to advise them. Using the church newspapers to advertise the Society she was overwhelmed with the response from all over the country. By her own admission she knew nothing of the theatre or of running an organisation. With the writer Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch as the Society's first president Kelly set up a costume supply and plays for villages to use. With the Women's Institutes growing in importance in the post-war years, promoting education and greater social equality, Kelly used WI meetings to speak on and promote village drama. The Village Drama Society moved its headquarters from Kelly House to Camberwell in London in 1924. When the Society amalgamated with the British Drama League in 1932 the League maintained Kelly as secretary of its Village Drama Section. She also became drama advisor for the Devon County Committee for Drama and Director of Drama at the University College of the South West, Exeter for its rural extension scheme. Kelly wrote religious plays for the Kelly Drama Society, beginning with Joseph which was performed on Ascension Day in 1919. She continued to write plays for Ascension for about seven or eight years. The actors were able to maintain their Devon dialect. In 1926 she wrote and directed a historical pageant in Selborne based on Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne. It was performed in the grounds of White's old home, The Wakes. The pageant was staged at The Wakes again in 1938. Other pageants followed at Rillington (1927), Bradstone (1929), Launceston (1931), Bude, and Exeter Cathedral ('The Pitifull Queene', 1932). Her play The Mother was a described as \\"a sharply class-conscious two act drama that parallels the death of a young child with the futile losses of war\\". When war broke out in 1939 Kelly moved to Exeter. In 1949 she emigrated to join a friend in South Africa where she did drama work with Europeans and Africans. She died on 5 November 1951 in Natal. Kelly is recognised as an important figure in the history of British amateur drama.  Honours and awards  Kelly received an OBE for her services to the British Drama League in 1949.

She had a minor career capturing a handful of merchantmen. She was wrecked on 5 January 1807 with great hardship for the survivors and loss of life. Origins Jean-Louis Barrallier designed Nautilus in a design approved on 7 February 1797. She was originally intended to be flush-decked but then the design was modified to include a quarterdeck and a forecastle. She was the only vessel of her type and the only sloop to have a main battery of 9-pounder guns. Career Commander George Aldham commissioned Nautilus in April 1804 for the Channel. On 9 August 1804 Nautilus recaptured the West Indiaman and sent her into Plymouth. The privateer General Augereau had captured her on 4 August in a notable single ship action. On 23 August Nautilus sent into Plymouth Count Suwaroff, Pondelli, master. Count Suwaroff had been sailing from Petersburg to Corunna. On 12 September Nautilus detained the American ship Colombe, of Boston, Iday, master. She had been sailing to Dunkirk with tobacco and staves. Colombe arrived at Plymouth the next day.Naval Chronicle (July‚ÄìDecember 1804), Vol.12, p.337. On 12 November Nautilus detained the Spanish shipEcho, Francisco Barzelo, master. Commander Aldham received a promotion to post captain on 20 February 1805. Before he left he sent into Plymouth a valuable Spanish ship from the River Plate that arrived on 23 February. The Spanish ship had fallen prey first to a Jersey privateer, and then to the French privateer before Nautilus recaptured her. This may have been the vessel Carmella, which had been carrying specie. Commander John Sykes replaced Aldham on 8 March 1805. On 29 September Nautilus captured Johanna Catharina, and on 3 October Eserance. The Vice Admiralty Court at Gibraltar condemned both. After the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, Lt. Lapenotiere in raced Captain Sykes in Nautilus over 1000 miles to England with the news of the victory. Pickle was the first to deliver the dispatches to the Admiralty. Lt. Lapenotiere was awarded the then huge sum of ¬£500 and was promoted to Commander. Sykes received a promotion to post captain on 22 January 1806 and in February 1806 Commander Edward Palmer replaced Sykes. Palmer sailed Nautilus for the Mediterranean. In the early morning of 4 May 1806, the boats of and Nautilus, under the command of Lieutenant Sir William Parker, of Renommee, brought out from under the fire of the guns of the town and tower of Vieja and also from under the fire of more than 100 musketeers, the Spanish naval schooner Giganta. Giganta was armed with two 24-pounders, three 4-pounder long guns, four 4-pounders, and swivel guns. She had a crew of 38 men under the command of Alfirre de Navis Don Juan de Moire. British casualties amounted to four men severely wounded and three lightly wounded; Spanish casualties consisted of one man mortally wounded and nime men severely wounded. There were no immediate fatalities. Captain Sir Thomas Livingstone, of Renommee, recommended that the Navy take Giganta into service at Gibraltar. On 8 July Nautilus sailed from Gibraltar for Malta. Fate Nautilusleft the Bay of Abydos, in the Hellespont, with urgent despatches for the Commander-in-chief off Cadiz. On 5 January 1807 she struck an uncharted rock between Kithera and Andikithers. The survivors reached the barren rock where they took refuge, though there was no shelter from the weather. The one surviving boat was manned and eventually was able to reach Kithera and summon help. It took six days for help to arrive and or 62 of the 122 men aboard died. Her second lieutenant gave the number of deaths as 58, consisting of some 18 men who drowned in the original wrecking, six men who died in attempts to leave the island, and 34 men who died of hunger and exposure. Captain Palmer died shortly before help arrived.
