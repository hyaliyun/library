GIMIAS is being funded by several national and international projects like cvREMOD, euHeart or VPH NoE.  About GIMIAS  GIMIAS stands for Graphical Interface for Medical Image Analysis and Simulation. GIMIAS provides a graphical user interface with all main data IO, visualization and interaction functions for images, meshes and signals. GIMIAS features include: * DICOM browser and PACS connection * Support for different imaging modalities * Biomedical data visualization in 2D and 3D: multiplanar reformation, ortho slice view, multi slice view, volume rendering, X-ray rendering, maximum intensity projection * Several input and output formats: DICOM, vtk, stl, Nifty, Analyze. * Movie control: play, pause, speed control * Multiple data objects: 2D DICOM images, 3D images, surface meshes, volumetric meshes, signals or annotations * Image and surface mesh annotations: landmarks, measurements and regions of interest * Clinical workflow navigation that can help the user to navigate from patient data to useful information for patient treatment. * Other additional tools for image segmentation, mesh manipulation and signal navigation. GIMIAS is a development framework that allows developers to create their own medical applications using different plug-ins that can be dynamically loaded and combined. The prototypes developed on GIMIAS can be verified by end users in real scenarios and with real data at early development stages. Is developed using C++ language, has a plug-in architecture, and is cross-platform by means of the standard CMake tool. Is possible to integrate new libraries using CSnake tool and is based on common open source libraries like VTK, ITK, MITK, BOOST and wxWidgets. A plug-in can extend the framework adding new processing components, GUI components like toolbars or windows, new data processing types or new rendering libraries. GIMIAS supports several types of plug-ins, starting from a simple DLL, a 3D Slicer compatible command line plug-in or a more complex GIMIAS plug-in with customized graphical interface. Automated GUI generation and extensible data object model allow to share plug-ins with other frameworks and empower interoperability. The software is available on Windows and Linux, 64-bit and 32-bit.  History  Initial versions of the open source framework was released by the end of 2009 (GIMIAS 0.6.15 was released in October 2009). In 2010, more effort was done to empower the open source framework itself, providing more functionality like workflow manager, 3D Slicer plug-in compatibility, signal viewer and customizable views. GIMIAS version 0.8.1, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 were released during this year. GIMIAS Team have collaborated with: * cmgui team: to trial the use of the interim cmgui API from the GIMIAS software platform * CTK group * B3C group (MAF) GIMIAS is one of the tools used in the Virtual Physiological Human.  Clinical Prototypes  * AngioLab is a software tool developed within the GIMIAS framework and is part of a more ambitious pipeline for the integrated management of cerebral aneurysms. AngioLab currently includes four plug-ins: angio segmentation, angio morphology virtual stenting and virtual angiography. In December 2009, 23 clinicians completed an evaluation questionnaire about AngioLab. This activity was part of a teaching course held during the 2nd European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurovascular Treatment (ESMINT) Teaching Course held at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain. The Automated Morphological Analysis (angio morphology plug-in) and the Endovascular Treatment Planning (stenting plug-in) were evaluated.

It is also one of the leading bus body manufacturers in the Philippines, other including Santarosa Motor Works, Inc.; Almazora Motors Corporation; and Hino Motors Philippines.  History  In 1950, it started manufacturing bus and truck bodies mounted on leading US brands, being International Harvester, Ford, Chevrolet, and the Dodge Chassis. Also, in the 1950s, its sister company, the Emcos Development & Supply Co., Inc. was the leading distributor of International Harvester Macleod, Inc. in Northern Luzon marketing bus chassis, trucks, tractors, agricultural and farm implements. At present, it is solely responsible for the introduction of Volvo articulated and bi-articulated buses in the Philippines. Philtrak, Volvo, and Del Monte have signed a supply and transfer of technology agreement wherein Volvo will supply its products, mainly the articulated and the bi-articulated bus chassis, and Del Monte will manufacture and assemble the bus body and deliver the finished bus product to Philtrak. Volvo agreed to transfer its technology in the assembly of its articulated and bi-articulated bus chassis to Philtrak and Del Monte jointly constituting a tri-partite agreement among the aforestated parties. Together, they intend to introduce the system not only in Metro Manila but all over the Philippines where the need arises especially on traffic clogged areas. It is also responsible in re-activating the sale of Isuzu buses in the Philippines when the combined resources of General Motors Corporation, the Yutivo group and its local subsidiary folded up in the middle 1980s by importing directly from the factory of Japan's Isuzu and supplying different bus operators. It is still authorized to import bus and truck chassis on CBU basis and packaging it with the bus or truck body manufactured from its plant. In October 2010 the chairman and owner Narciso O. Morales created a bus company called Del Monte Land Transport Bus Company (DLTBCO). Their buses are also made from the company with High Class Greyhound facilities.  Facilities  It has four existing plants and facilities in the Philippines. Two of them are located in Quezon City the third one at Sto. Tomas, Pampanga and the fourth one at Caloocan City. It has a tested capacity of a minimum of sixty units of bus and truck bodies a month. It has supplied the majority of bus bodies for the government-owned corporations like the Metro Manila Transit Corporation and the PNR (Phil. National Railways) Motor Service. Before the introduction of these articulated buses, Del Monte has pioneered in the manufactured of bus trailers with a capacity of 200 passengers which were operated by MMTC in EDSA and by a private bus operator in the long stretch Marcos Highway. It was also involved in the assembly and rehabilitation of the British Leyland double deckers used to be operated by the same MMTC.

The route was largely created by modifying existing waterways and public roads, with the addition of some new road sections. Specially constructed ships, barges and road vehicles carry the aircraft parts on the route, as traditional transportation methods proved unfeasible. The parts are not handled directly.Morales, Jesus. \\"The A380 Transport Project and Logistics ‚Äì Assessment of alternatives\\" p19 Airbus, 18 January 2006. Retrieved 15 April 2012. Major sections of the fuselage of the A380 are built in northern France, Germany and Spain, whilst the wings are built in the United Kingdom. Due to the size of the A380, most of these parts are moved on the surface through the Itin√©raire √† Grand Gabarit, although some smaller parts are carried by the A300-600ST Beluga aircraft used in the construction of other, smaller, Airbus models. By ship to Bordeaux The Ville de Bordeaux at the Pauillac transfer dock; the barge Breuil can be seen to the left The first stage of the route uses a fleet of three Roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ships; the Ville de Bordeaux (2004), the City of Hamburg (2008) and the Ciudad de Cadiz (2009). These ships are controlled by Fret Cetam SA, a joint venture between shipping companies H√∂egh Autoliners and Louis Dreyfus Armateurs, and leased to Airbus. The front and rear sections of the fuselage are loaded aboard one of the fleet in Hamburg in northern Germany, after which the ship travels to Mostyn in the United Kingdom. The wings, which are manufactured at Filton in Bristol and Broughton in North Wales, are transported by barge on the River Dee to Mostyn docks, where the ship adds them to its cargo. The Ciudad de Cadiz went aground without cargo on sandbanks outside Mostyn in January 2013, when its moorings burst during high winds. The next stop is Saint-Nazaire, in western France, where the ship trades the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. The ship then proceeds to Pauillac, the port of Bordeaux, where it unloads. The ship then proceeds to C√°diz in southern Spain, where it picks up the belly and tail sections manufactured by Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA, and delivers them to Pauillac. By barge to Langon From Pauillac, the A380 parts are transported by barge through the centre of Bordeaux on the River Garonne. The barges carry the parts to Langon, where a special dock has been built to permit the offloading of the barges. New barges were developed to carry A380 parts. These incorporate ballast tanks, to enable the barges to adjust their water and air draughts to the prevailing conditions. Certain parts of the route must be undertaken at high tide in order to provide sufficient water under the keel, whilst the passage under the Pont de pierre in Bordeaux is undertaken at low tide to provide sufficient headroom. The Canal de Garonne allows barges to go to Toulouse but has insufficient headroom for A380 parts, requiring parts to travel by road on the final leg of their journey. By road convoy to Toulouse Road convoy in an intermediate layover point outside L'Isle-Jourdain From Langon the parts are taken by oversize road convoys over a southerly, and indirect, route to Toulouse. The route was largely determined by the need to avoid any over- bridges. Many adjustments were necessary to junction and other layouts to allow the convoys to pass. In places new roads were constructed, some of which are reserved for the use of the convoys. Convoys travel mostly at night, laying over during the day at specially constructed secure parking areas. The route passes through or past the following places: * Langon * Bazas * Bernos- Beaulac * Captieux * Maillas * Losse * Gabarret * Barbotan-les-Thermes * Eauze * D√©mu * Vic-Fezensac * Saint-Jean-Poutge * Auch * Aubiet * Gimont * L'Isle- Jourdain * S√©goufielle * L√©vignac * Cornebarrieu The section to Toulouse is designed for transporting a package of a size up to 14 meters high, 8 meters wide and 50 meters long.

KG, is a German fashion company headquartered in Rottendorf that sells apparel, shoes, accessories, jewellery, fragrances and eyewear worldwide.  History  The company was founded in 1969 by Bernd Freier (who was also its billionaire CEO until 2014 ) as a small boutique in W√ºrzburg with only 25 square metres of floor space, named Sir Oliver after the hero of Charles Dickens novel, Oliver Twist. To reflect the spirit of the times, the 'Sir' was added to the name in homage to the London fashion scene and to add international flair to the boutique, as the British capital's most successful gentleman's outfitters also featured a 'Sir' in their names. In the 1970s, fashion suppliers were frequently unable to deliver the quantities ordered by retailers or to deliver them on time. In 1974, Bernd Freier decided to travel to India to negotiate directly with local textile manufacturers, thereby gaining independence from the wholesalers. Subsequently, he had his own successful range of 'Madras Check shirts' manufactured, which found a ready market in Germany, sold through, amongst others, E. Breuninger GmbH & Co, Uli Knecht, W√∂hrl and Wormland. In 1978, following a legal dispute with '4711', the eau de Cologne brand owned by M√§urer & Wirtz GmbH & Co. KG perfume manufacturers, who had registered the name 'Sir' as a trademark, 'Sir Oliver' was changed to the current brand name, 's.Oliver', and registered under that name in 1979 with the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) in Munich. In 1987, s.Oliver bought out denim fashion manufacturer Chicago and re-launched the brand under the name Knockout. In 1993, Chaloc GmbH was founded, becoming the well-known 'comma' brand in 2002. 'comma' now operates autonomously and completely independent from s.Oliver. In 1998, the first retail store outside Germany was opened in Austria. Shops in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg soon followed. Over the next few years, s.Oliver carried on expanding in countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland. s.Oliver developed in this way into one of Germany's - and Europe's - leading fashion companies within a few decades, offering a range of fashion and lifestyle products for all ages. In 2001, s.Oliver took over the German fashion brand comma.Comma History (German) 2008 saw the opening and inauguration of the new s.Oliver headquarters in Rottendorf, including 's.Oliver Mini Club', the company's own day care. The company currently owns a total of 173 retail stores, as well as running 400 stores in cooperation with partner companies; its products are also sold in 1,991 shops and feature on 2,507 sales floors. Today, s.Oliver is to be found in more than 30 countries, for example in Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, Belgium, Poland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia, France, Italy, Czech Republic and India. The company has managed to more than quadruple its turnover since 1995, passing a billion euros in 2007. In 2009, the s.Oliver Group generated a brand turnover total of 1.16 billion euros. A once tiny retail store has grown into one of Europe's 20 largest fashion companies.

The following year, s.Oliver's Knock Out brand became German Formula 3 driver Timo Scheider's main sponsor.

The main function of roller reamers cut earth formations to enlarge the borehole to the desirable size during well drilling operation, which may be the original size of the drill bit in the case where the drill bit wears to be under-gauged. However, even for new drill bits, roller reamers are employed to cut formations because the bit does not always drill a true bore hole and because of slight lateral shifting which is inherent in the drilling operation, which shifting leaves ledges and other distortions. Additionally, the second function of a roller reamer is to keep the drill stem in the center of the hole at the specific position of placement of the roller- reamer. In providing such a function, a reamer is often referred to as a stabilizer. Maintaining the drill stem centered has many beneficial effects, its primary one being minimizing unintentional hole-angle directional drilling. Sizes Range of Roller-reamers Popular hole sizes for well bores range from 5\\" to 26\\" in diameter. Size of circulation passage through the center of the body of the reamer typically range from 1 1/2\\" to 3 1/4\\" in diameter. The body size on the necks beyond the area where the rollers are mounted typically range from 4 1/8\\" to 11\\" in diameter. This latter size will normally be the same size as the drill collar. Body links normally range from 4' to 8'. 3-point / 6-point Most roller-reamers have three rollers equally spaced in a single transverse section. Such roller-reamers are referred to as \\"3-point reamer\\". When two sets of three rollers spaced apart longitudinally are used, the roller-reamer is called a \\"6-point reamer\\". However, large diameter roller-reamers may have more than three rollers in one transverse section.

Ros Beiaardommegang 2000 in Dendermonde with the brothers Coppieters. Ros Beiaardommegang 2010 in Dendermonde with the brothers Van Damme. Statue of the Ros Beiaard Ros Beiaard of Dendermonde is a large folkloristic horse. It differs from the other Ros-Beiaard horses because it is used only once every ten years and because the horse is carried by people. The Ros Beiaard is on UNESCO's list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, under the \\"Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France\\". The legend of Ros Beiaard * See: Ros Beiaard 't Peird van Dendermonde The Ros Beiaard of Dendermonde is carried through the town every ten years by a guild of bearers, called the 'Pijnders'. In keeping with the legend, four young brothers from Dendermonde (de Vier Heemskinderen) wearing full armour sit astride the horse. The legend of Ros Beiaard is acted out during the procession. Dimensions and weight From the ground to the tallest part of the head, the Ros Beiaard is 4.85m high. If one adds the decorations on top, then the horse is 5.8m high. From nose to tail, the Ros is 5.2m long and the width is exactly 2m. The head of the Ros Beiaard is made out of oak wood and it is 120 cm long and 50 cm wide. The horse weighs 800 kg without the brothers on top. The wooden frame has three spaces and has space for 12 bearers or 'Pijnders'. The four 'Heemskinderen' Every ten years, the selection of the four 'Heemskinderen' is difficult. The criteria are severe: * It has to be four consecutive brothers, without a girl in between. * They all have to be born in Dendermonde. * The parents and grandparents have to be born in Dendermonde. * They have to be between 7 and 21 years old on the day of the procession. * They have to live in Dendermonde or one of its suburbs. =19th century= In 1807, the Ros was ridden by Pieter-Emmanuel, Pieter-Frans, Pieter-Jan and Bernard-Jozef Blomme. The horse was used to celebrate the birthday of Napoleon I and the Concordate. In 1850 the brothers were Edmond, D√©sir√©, Henri and Lodewijk Spanogh. The procession celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Court and the Academy of Arts. The historian David Lindanus was also commemorated and king Leopold II attended the procession. The inauguration of the statue of Pater De Smet in 1878 entailed a new procession and the knights were Isidoor, Omer, Petrus and Frans Willems. They also celebrated the inauguration of the new lock in the Dender. When Polydore de Keyser, Lord Mayor of London, visited his birth town Dendermonde in 1888, the Heemskinderen were Henri, Lodewijk, Gustaaf and Alfons Pieters. In 1899, the Ros Beiaard was ridden by Pieter, Adhemar, Lucinthe and Leo Dieltjens. They celebrated a new bridge over the Scheldt. =20th century= In 1914, the knights were Jan, Leo, Pieter and Edward De Bruyn. The celebration was the appointment of Leo Bruynincx as mayor of Dendermonde. In 1930, Dendermonde celebrated the centenary of the Belgian independence and the Horse was ridden by Henri, Jean, Pierre and Albert Van Damme. In 1952, Jozef, Rafa√´l, Pieter and Jan Bombay were the knights. The town hall existed for 500 years and this was celebrated. In 1958, because of the World's Fair in Brussels, the brothers Emiel, Albert, Jozef and Luc Leybaert rode the Ros. In 1975 the brothers Dirk, Wim, Boudewijn and Kris De Jonghe rode the Horse. In 1990 the honour befell the brothers Veldeman. In 2000 the brothers Roy, Nick, Ken and Dean Coppieters rode the Ros. =21st century= In 2010 the procession was held in May and the Van Damme brothers rode the horse.http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=J92QLDTD The Pijnders The guild of the Pijnders originated in the 14th century and had the monopoly on loading and unloading ships and cellars with wine and beer. Today, the Pijnders are the only persons allowed to carry the Ros Beiaard in the processions. The task of the Pijnders must not be underestimated, as they occupy a main function in the procession in carrying the horse. The movements of the horse have to be synchronized with the directions of the director. The Pijnders are divided into three groups consisting each of twelve carriers. Every group has its leader who has to set the pace and order the special movements. The Hymn The legend is told in the city hymn of Dendermonde. The hymn also refers to the rivalry with the neighbor city of Aalst who purportedly envy the Dendermonde for its horse. The Ros Beiaard hymn { class=\\"vatop\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\"  't Ros Beiaard doet zijn ronde In de stad van Dendermonde Die van Aalst die zijn zo kwaad omdat hier 't Ros Beiaard gaat. refrein: De vier Aymons kinderen jent Met blanke zweerd in d'hand Ziet ze rijden 't Zijn de schoonsten van ons land  't Ros Beiaards ogen fonk'len Zijne brede manen kronk'len En hij wendt hem fraai en vlug Met vier broers op zijnen rug.

Located between the steep topography of the Central Balkan and the significantly lower and sloping eastern part of Stara Planina, the region is characterized by significant diversity in terrain. This supports a rich diversity in flora and fauna. Further, due to the area's position in a section of the Balkans that served as a crossroads for the region for centuries, the park is home to many historic sites. The area‚Äôs historical and biological significance lead to the establishment of the Bulgarka Natural Park on August 9, 2002. Fauna In terms of zoology, the park is in the Balkan region of European fauna. Many wild animals, such as the Eurasian wolf, fox, the golden jackal, Eurasian brown bear, wild boar, red deer, roe deer, hare, eastern hedgehog, squirrel, badger, mink and others inhabit the forested lands of the Bulgarka Park. Birds include the golden eagle, the common kestrel, rock dove, great spotted woodpecker, black woodpecker, green woodpecker, cuckoo, common buzzard, owl, white wagtail, turtledove, jay, magpie, raven, hooded crow, blackbird, starling, nightingale, oriole, great tit and others. Reptiles native to the park lands include three species of snakes as well as lizards and others. Amphibians include several frogs, salamander; invertebrates include snails, tritons and many kinds of insects. Fish include trout, black fish, and others. Flora Forest fruits (Daphne mezereum) in Bulgarka Nature Park Forests cover about 80.2% of the park area, or 17,461 hectares. Varieties of beech constitute the largest portion of the forest, at 65%. Other deciduous trees include oaks, water locust, birch hornbeam, linden, elm, acacia, aspen, maple, ash, wild cherry, holly, rowan, birch and others. Coniferous trees found in the park include white and black pine, spruce, fir, white fir and others. Gymnosperm plants covers about 0.6 ha. This botanical uniqueness ‚Äî which occurs only in this part of Bulgaria and has includes special combinations of beech, yew, and laurel ‚Äî makes the park a significant conservation habitat. In Bulgarka Park, designated areas are established to promote greater habitat conservation. Nearly 70% of the officially recognized medicinal plants in Bulgaria may be found in Bulgarka Park. At least 360 plant species including 31 species listed as threatened or endangered, may be found in the park. This includes yew, wild ticket silivryak gesneriaceae, mountain maple, Bulgarian types of orchids, medicinal tweeter, mountain onion cytisus, mountain vetch astragalus, among other. However, as one of the youngest nature parks in Bulgaria, a full classification of all the types of flora and fauna is yet to come. Cultural heritage Sites of cultural heritage inside Bulgarka Park include the Shipka Pass, the location of the Battle of Shipka Pass which was pivotal in gaining Bulgarian independence from the Ottoman Empire. The Shipka Memorial commemorates the battle. Also in the park are the Etar Architectural- Ethnographic Complex, the Sokolski Monastery and Dryanovo Monastery. The park is home to the Uzana area, a large mountain meadow high in the Balkans which is a popular winter resort. Uzana has been home to winter sports since the 1930s and has 15 hotels, which provide recreational opportunities year-round.

Life He was the son of Sir John Guildford (1430‚Äì1493), Comptroller of the Household to Edward IV, by his first wife, Alice Waller. He was relied on as a councillor by Reginald Bray, who chose him as one of the four persons to whom he first communicated the plot behind Buckingham's rebellion against Richard III in 1483. Both father and son raised forces that year for the Earl of Richmond (the future Henry VII) in Kent, and were attainted in consequence. The son, who thereby forfeited some lands in Cranbrook, fled to Richmond in Brittany, and returned with him two years later, landing along with him at Milford Haven, where he is said to have been knighted. It is presumed he was with Henry at the Battle of Bosworth. Little more than a month later, on 29 September 1485, the new king appointed him one of the chamberlains of the receipt of exchequer, Master of the Ordnance and of the Armouries, with houses on Tower Wharf, and keeper of the royal manor of Kennington, where the king took up his abode before his coronation. When Henry's first parliament met, his attainder was reversed. As master of the armoury he had to prepare the ‚Äòjustes‚Äô for the king's coronation. The king also made him a privy councillor and granted him various lands and some wardships which fell vacant. Among the former was the manor of Higham in Sussex. His forte lay in the control of artillery and fortifications, engineering and shipbuilding, for which various payments to him are recorded. The lands he won from the sea were called Guilford Level. In 1486 he received payment for the making of a ship in county of Kent; on 8 March 1487 he was paid as master of a vessel called the Mary Gylford, named probably after a daughter, who, in Henry VIII's time, was married to one Christopher Kempe. There were more payments for shipbuilding. In 1487 the treasurer and barons of the exchequer had seized the office of chamberlain of the receipt, which had been granted to him by the king for life; but he obtained a warrant under the privy seal to prevent them proceeding further until the king himself had examined the official arrangements, with a view apparently to greater efficiency. A little later he surrendered the office, which was then granted to Giles Daubeny, 8th Baron Daubeny. On 14 July 1487 Guildford was granted the wardship, marriage and custody of her lands during her minority of Elizabeth Mortimer, daughter and heiress of Robert Mortimer (d. 22 August 1485) of Landmere in Thorpe-le-Soken, slain at Bosworth, by Isabel Howard, daughter of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. Guildford later married Elizabeth to his second son, George. In September 1489 certain alterations were ordered to be made in the buildings of Westminster Palace under the direction of Guildford and the Earl of Ormonde. In 1490 Guildford undertook to serve the king at sea with 550 marines and soldiers, in three ships, for two months from 12 July. On 20 February 1492 Henry VII made his will in view of his proposed invasion of France, and appointed Guildford one of his trustees. He accompanied the king to Boulogne, and attended him at the meeting with the French commissioners for peace immediately after. On 1 February 1493 he was given the wardship and marriage of Thomas, grandson and heir of Sir Thomas Delamere. On 19 July he lost his father, Sir John Guildford, a privy councillor like himself, who was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. In 1493-4 he was appointed High Sheriff of Kent. About 1495 he was named one of six commissioners to arrange with the Spanish ambassador about the marriage of Prince Arthur and Catherine of Aragon. In the parliament which assembled in October 1495 he was one of those members who announced to the chancellor the election of the speaker. In that parliament he obtained an act for disgavelling his lands in Kent. About this time he was controller of the royal household; and on 21 April 1496 he was made steward of the lands which had belonged to the Duchess of York in Surrey and Sussex. On 17 June 1497 he assisted in defeating the Cornish rebels at Blackheath, for which service he was created a banneret. In 1499 he and Richard Hatton were commissioned by the king to go in quest of Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, after his first flight to the continent, and persuade him to come back. He had a further charge to go to the Archduke Philip; but the priority was the bringing back of De la Pole, and he was instructed to forego that journey if the refugee would not return without him. In 1500 he went over with the king to the meeting with the archduke at Calais. In the same year he was elected a Knight of the Garter. In 1501, as controller of the household, he had much to do with the arrangements for the reception of Catherine of Aragon. On 4 April 1506 he had what was called a special pardon: a discharge of liabilities in respect of his offices of master of the ordnance and of the armoury, and also as master of the horse. On 7 April 1506 in the same year he made his will. Next day he embarked at Rye along with John Whitby, prior of Gisburn in Yorkshire, on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. They landed next day in Normandy, and passed through France, Savoy, and the north of Italy to Venice, whence, after some stay, they sailed on 3 July. After visiting Crete and Cyprus on their way they reached Jaffa on 18 Aug. But before landing they had to send a message to Jerusalem to the warden of Mount Sion, and they remained seven days in their galley till he came with the lords of Jerusalem and Rama, without whose escort no pilgrims were allowed to pass. Two more days were spent in debating the tribute to be paid by the company before they could be suffered to land, so that they only disembarked on 27 August. They were forced by the Mamelukes to spend a night and a day in a cave, and when allowed to proceed upon their journey both Guildford and the prior fell ill. They did reach Jerusalem, but the prior died there on 5 September, and Guildford the next day. Guildford's chaplain prepared an account of ‚ÄòThe Pylgrymage of Sir Richard Guylforde to the Holy Land, A.D. 1506,‚Äô which Richard Pynson printed in 1511. It was reprinted by Sir Henry Ellis for the Camden Society in 1851. Guildford's will was proved 10 May 1508. Marriages and issue Guildford married firstly Anne Pympe, daughter of John Pympe of Kent, by whom he had two sons and five daughters: * Sir Edward Guildford; married firstly, before 1496, Eleanor West (b. 1481 (daughter of Thomas West, 8th Baron De La Warr, and sister and co- heir of Thomas West, 9th Baron De La Warr), by whom he had a son, Richard, who predeceased him, and a daughter, Jane, who married John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland.

2000‚Äì2010 A row counter for hand knitting is a tally counter for counting rows or courses worked, for counting stitch pattern repetitions, or for counting increases or decreases of the number of stitches in consecutive rows. The first commercially produced one appeared on the market in the 1920s after the general public started regularly knitting from unfamiliar printed and complex patterns. Design variations include on-needle barrel-shaped counters for straight-needle work, stitch- marker counters for knitting on double-pointed and circular needles, complex counters which attempted to assist with decreases, increases and lacework, stand-alone hand-held counters in imitation of the hand-tally, pendant counters worn round the neck and online software for iPhones. Early tally methods in Europe and the United States Five bar gate tally marks made by knitter on pattern, 1960s Until the early 19th century, in Europe and the United States, groups of localised professional hand knitters specialised in a few well-known patterns in which keeping a tally of rows was barely necessary, since the pattern and expected size of the work were known by heart. From the early 19th century, when printed patterns were introduced for the recreational knitter, and until the early 20th century, woollen yarn had clear stitch definition so that rows were easily seen and counted, and a mental tally could be kept. However knitters could tally by moving objects from one pocket to another, or bracelets from one wrist to the other. For lace knitting and complicated increases, a knitter could write five-bar gate tally marks around the margins of a printed pattern. File:Tally b12.svg On-needle row counters =Flat-faced type= Woman's Weekly flat-faced on-needle counter The earliest on-needle row counters seem to have appeared in the UK between 1920 and 1939, when complicated printed patterns increased in popularity among the working population. In the 1920s a grey-brown enamelled unit was manufactured with two rotary dials on the front showing tens and units, and slots on the back for sliding onto a knitting needle. The front was flat and shaped like a figure-8, but was heavier than the back so that the unit hung downward from the needle, making the numbered face difficult to read. A similar bakelite unit was manufactured by Abel Morrell for sale in the US in the 1930s. Around the 1980s to 1990s, Woman's Weekly magazine gave away a plastic on-needle knitting row counter of unusual design. It was presented as a self-assembly kit, in a small blue envelope with assembly instructions and a diagram on the back. According to the diagram, the gadget consists of (a) two blue front and back plates, pierced to show the numbers; (b) an inner white soft plastic frame to hold the number discs and to which are attached the two loops to bend back and thread on the needle; (c) the two number discs. So the disks don't spin on an axis; they spin within circular spaces in the inner frame. =Rotary barrel type= I.X. Products on-needle row counters 1950s In Britain in the 1950s when the baby boom years following World War II caused an increased requirement for hand-knitting, I.X. Products produced a brightly coloured and marketable plastic row counter with patent number 424432. This was a barrel-shaped counter which sat in stable fashion on the knitting needle by the aid of a central metal spring. The assemblage consisted of a double rotating inner barrel and an outer fixed and slotted skin which was pinned to the central spring. Millward Ro-Tally on-needle counters, 1950s The two separately rotating halves of the inner barrel were printed with numbers, and the outer slotted skin rotated over the barrels, revealing a single ten and a single unit at one time. Precise engineering ensured that there was just enough ease of movement for the turning of the barrels, but just enough friction to prevent movement of the barrels while vigorous knitting continued. However the introduction in the late 1950s of double knitting yarn and the consequent popular use of thicker needles tended to damage the springs which were intended for needles of a maximum thickness of 3.25mm. This design and most of the barrel-shaped on-needle counters which followed it had a white or cream central barrel and a decoratively coloured outer skin. 1970s Millward Ro-Tally counters In the 1950s and 1960s the UK knitting accessories manufacturer Millward produced the Ro-Tally, whose name was a pun on rotary. Its design was very similar to the I.X. Products version, it used the same patent number and the precision of engineering was improved, although the inner spring was still too small for 4 mm needles. The Millward Ro-Tally was re-designed quite differently in the 1970s in various sizes, of softer plastic with a plastic spring which fitted large and small needles. These counters were not precisely engineered, so depended on polygonal barrels and outer skin to provide sufficient friction to control unnecessary movement while knitting. Compact luxury on-needle counters, 1960s Counters used in US 2000‚Äì2010 The Compact rotary row counter was manufactured in England in the 1950s to 1960s under a pending patent application, although the general design was similar in principle to the early I.X. Products version. It had the same precise engineering for control of friction, and central metal spring suitable for needles up to 3.5 mm. The basic Compact, however, had a central knurled grip- band, which made the gadget easier to hold and to turn quickly and precisely. The earlier version of the late 1950s to early 1960s had red numerals, and the later 1960s version had black numerals. The luxury version of the Compact was presented in a gift box, it was priced at a guinea and became a contemporary collector's item, tending to be little-used due to impracticality. The assemblage included a thin and delicate 6-inch ‚Äì later 8-inch ‚Äì tape measure in place of the grip band. On this luxury version the tape-measure assembly caused the centre of the gadget to rotate independently, making it difficult for adult fingers to grip the remaining part of the stable outer skin to turn the main assemblage for use as a row counter. Some of the counters in this range featured pearlised plastic outer skins in various pastel colours. Around the 1960s to 1970s Woman's Weekly magazine gave away a soft plastic on-needle knitting row counter of unusual but simple design. Two numbered blue-and-white barrels rotate independently around a central white spindle, which has a number-pointer at one end and a loop to thread onto a needle at the other end. The friction (to prevent the barrels rolling freely) is maintained by the tightness of the number-pointer and shortness of the spindle. 21st century polygonal on-needle counters by Pony and Whitecroft In the 1980s the knitting accessories company Aero produced its own rotary on-needle counter which had a distinctive red inner barrel with thick knurled ends, and a grey outer skin. The red colour of the inner barrel meant that the numbers had to be printed in white, and were more easily visible than the small black printed numbers on earlier versions. Aero later produced a blue and white version of the same design, with the name Inox printed on it. In the 1990s Wrights Boyle and Prym began to produce a similar design with white inner barrels and coloured outer skin which continued to be sold in different sizes until at least 2010. In the 21st century until at least 2010, the manufacturers Pony, Whitecroft and Wrights each made a new version of the 1970s octagonal counter for sale in Europe, the UK and the United States. At the same time the Japanese knitting accessories supplier Clover was exporting a version of the 1980s Aero counter, with dark inner barrels and white numbers, to the same customer base, although at first they supplied a pink version to the UK, and a blue version to the United States. =Jewellery type= Commercial and home-crafted, beaded row counters appeared from 2000 until at least 2010. Some of these involved suspending jewellery from the needle and marking off beads as rows progressed. =Stitch-marker row counters= Stitch-marker counter These tend to be on- needle barrel row counters which have been attached to stitch-marker rings. They are intended to be used with circular or double-pointed knitting needles. In the 21st century Prym has marketed a dedicated stitch-marker row counter, labelling it the Universal Rotally. Complex row counters The MP Handy Guide 1936 Aero complex counter 1960s In 1936 The MP Handy Guide to Knitting and Crochet was patented under number 813814 and manufactured in Britain as a pair of rectangular flat metal plates sandwiching a paper card marked with number lists, and sliders with markers to record current row number, increase, decrease and times. However the metal slides did not work smoothly and could get stuck. The gadget incorporated a small ruler and needle gauge. There is an example of this counter in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The paper instructions pasted on the back carried the following legend: > \\"Rows: When knitting and suddenly called away, mark off the number of rows > reached. > Increase/decrease: For casting on, or casting off stitches. > Times: To mark off the pattern when doing fancy knitting, etc. > Measure: Very handy when tape measure is mislaid. > Needle gauge: For correct sizes from 6 to 12.\\" A paper card version of the MP Handy Guide was published with folded card sliders for the war effort under the auspices of the UK Ministry of Defence during World War II and was intended for use by people knitting gloves, socks and balaclavas for the troops. In the 1960s, The Aero Needles Group Plc of Redditch, England produced the Knitters Companion, a pocket version of the complex counter, consisting of a pierced bar of black plastic containing seven knurled, white, rotary, numbered discs whose numbers would appear through the piercings in the bar. As in the MP Handy Guide, the numbers were labelled Increase, Decrease, Rows and Times. It was supplied with a soft plastic case which was intended to maintain memory of the count by preventing accidental movement of the discs. In 1972, UK magazine Woman's Weekly gave away its own card variation of this, with the numbers on dials with rotary paper pointers to record rows, increases or decreases, and times. Like the MP Handy Guide it incorporated a small inch-ruler and needle gauge, but now added a tension gauge measure and centimetre ruler. Plastic complex counter, 2008 In spring 2008 the UK magazine Simply Knitting no.39 gave away a green plastic version of the MP Handy Guide, without needle gauge or ruler and with a clarified version of the same instructions moulded onto the back: > \\"Rows: move the markers when you have completed each row. > Increase and decrease: keep count each time you need to increase or > decrease stitches. > Times: use the markers when you need to make more than one set of increases > or decreases.\\" This version illustrated the difficulty of mass-producing such a gadget cheaply: the inner card is easily displaced during assembly, thereby misplacing the numbers, and some of the sliders do not move easily. Counters made of card These include the World War II card counter, and the 1972 Woman's Weekly card counter, both mentioned above. The wartime counter was a pierced card glued to a flat backing card; the front card contained strips printed with numerals and with slider-indicators. The numerals represented rows, increase or decrease, and times, as in previous complex counters; it also had a needle gauge and five-inch measure. The reverse contained instructions for use, and the legend: \\"a handy help for the war-time knitter\\". The wartime counter was a version of the 1930s Bestway card counter. In the 1920s to 1930s, various card counters were produced in the UK, including the Little Dorrit counter, and the schoolgirl counter. From around 2006 Maik Remmers designed and manufactured in Germany a series of 3D card counters in the shape of skeins of wool, animals and abstract designs. These are folded and printed on back and front, with a pair of rotatable number discs sandwiched between the layers of card. The discs can be rotated to reveal numerals through two windows in the front layer of card. The outer surface of the card can be written-on with water-soluble ink, and the back surface of the counter contains a form where the knitter can fill in current row numbers. This is necessary as there is not enough friction to prevent the number discs from moving during storage. Viyella needle gauge and knitting counter Viyella row counter The Viyella needle gauge and knitting counter was created between 1936 and 1940. It is sizeable and heavy at high and across, and is enamelled and chromed. The two flat, chromed ends of the drum are pierced to form a needle gauge. The ends rotate on the enamelled drum such that red or white enamelled numbers are revealed through piercings in the sides of both drum-ends. There is a black and a white version of this design and each has a transfer picture of two children in the style of Mabel Lucie Attwell. A third form, in black and without the picture, was possibly an austerity version produced during World War II. Pony total knitting system Pony total knitting system The Pony Total Knitting System was manufactured by Pony in the 1990s, but ceased manufacture around 2008. It consisted of a pair of short needles with flexible cables attached to the ends, so that heavy knitted items did not have to be supported on long, straight needles. The ends of the cables were knobbed to prevent stitches falling off, and one cable had an on-needle- type barrel row-counter affixed to the end. However, unlike the standard on- needle row-counter, this counter was not removable, and there was a counter on one of every pair of needles of this design. Handheld mechanical and electronic row counters 1930s bakelite bookmark counters The earliest of these, alongside the MP Handy Guide and Viyella counters above, was possibly the bakelite knitting pattern bookmark made in England in the 1930s, which incorporated a counter for 1‚Äì16 rows and a needle gauge. The large, red, mechanical Kacha-Kacha handheld counter of 2000‚Äì2010 by Clover is robustly made for adult hands and for older eyes which require large, clear numerals. However it has no toddler-proof or drop-proof lock to maintain the count. Because it does not attach to a lanyard, it is more suited to the stationary workbasket than to travelling needlework. However, there is a similar design with a lock manufactured by KA in pink plastic for sale in the United States in the early 21st century, at least until 2010. =Pendant knitting counters= Pendant counters In the 21st century and at least until 2010, the Japanese company Clover was producing the bright green pendant Mini Kacha- Kacha which is designed like a hand-held mechanical tally counter, but is oriented upside-down on a neck pendant for easy reading by the user. It has a button to advance the numbers singly, access to the knurled number rings for adjustment of numbers, and a lock to prevent interference by the user dropping the gadget or by children playing with it. On this type of gadget it has been possible for the manufacturer to make the numbers larger and therefore easier to read than on the on-needle counter, which needs to be small. In August 2007 the UK magazine Simply Knitting no.32 gave away a free pendant knitting counter in a form of a white sheep, and in June 2010 the same magazine no.67 gave away another one in the shape of a yellow flower. Unfortunately the numerals on the yellow flower version were oriented incorrectly, causing inconvenience for the wearer of the pendant. =Electronic pendant knitting counters= Electronic counter The pendant Electronic Row Counter was produced in the early 21st century and was sold in the United States at least until 2010. Its LCD display counts up to 4 digits, whereas all foregoing knitting row counters were limited to 2 digits. It has add- and subtract-buttons which allow the user to count forwards and backwards in increments of one with an audible beep at each press, and the on-off button can be used to reset the count to zero. Because there is no memory facility, the counter must be left turned on if the count is to be maintained; however the gadget's instructions say that the battery will last for over seven months. There is no lock so that the maintained count is vulnerable to playing children. The more complex version of this counter, the Electronic Row Counter Plus, has ceased manufacture. Row counter software online =Applications for iPhone= The Knit Counter Lite, Knit Counter and Knit Row Counter are applications downloadable for iTunes which can be used on iPhone. JKnit Knitting Project Assistant is a similar application for iPhone, and so is Knitbuddy which has been renamed Vogue Knitting iPhone App. My Row Counter enables the knitter to count rows while reading a knitting pattern. =Applications for PC= The Lo- Fat Row Counter is a basic online facility designed in 2008 for PC. =Applications for Android= The Knitting Buddy application is downloadable from the Google Play Store., and so is the Row Counter application.

Niskin bottles and (blue) CTD-logger A CTD or Sonde is an oceanography instrument used to measure the conductivity, temperature, and pressure of seawater (the D stands for \\"depth,\\" which is closely related to pressure).http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/tools/sonde_ctd/sondectd.html The reason to measure conductivity is that it can be used to determine the salinity. The CTD may be incorporated into an array of Niskin bottles referred to as a carousel or rosette. The sampling bottles close at predefined depths, triggered either manually or by a computer, and the water samples may subsequently be analyzed further for biological and chemical parameters. The CTD may also be used for the calibration of sensors.  Measured properties  The instrument is a cluster of sensors which measure conductivity, temperature, and pressure. Sensors commonly scan at a rate of 24 Hz. Depth measurements are derived from measurement of hydrostatic pressure, and salinity is measured from electrical conductivity.Pickard and Emery 1990, p 100 Sensors are arranged inside a metal or resin housing, the material used for the housing determining the depth to which the CTD can be lowered. Titanium housings allow sampling to depths in excess of . Other sensors may be added to the cluster, including some that measure chemical or biological parameters, such as dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence, the latter an indication of the concentration of microscopic photosynthetic organisms (phytoplankton) contained in the water.  Deployment  R/V Endeavor Deployment of the rosette is from the deck of a research vessel. The instrument is lowered into the water in what is called the downcast to a determined depth or to a few meters above the ocean floor, generally at a rate of about 0.5 m/s. Most of the time a conducting wire cable is attached to the CTD frame connecting the CTD to an onboard computer, and allows instantaneous uploading and real time visualization of the collected data on the computer screen. The water column profile of the downcast is often used to determine the depths at which the rosette will be stopped on its way back to the surface (the upcast) to collect the water samples using the attached bottles.  Technological development  The CTD system was conceived by Neil Brown at the CSIRO Division of Marine Research. Lack of interest by the management saw Brown move to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The CTD overcame the limitations of an earlier similar system also developed by Brown, called an STD. The improvement was made possible thanks to increased reliability and reduced cost of computer technology.Baker 1981, pp 416-418 Prior to this, the Mechanical Bathythermograph (MBT) was the norm  Advantages and limitations  The advantage of CTD casts is the acquisition of high-resolution data. The limitation of CTD sampling is that only a point in space (the sampling site) can be sampled at one time, and many casts, which are costly and time- consuming, are needed to acquire a broad picture of the marine environment of interest. From the information gathered during CTD casts, however, scientists can investigate how physical parameters are related, for example, to the observed distribution and variation of organisms that live in the ocean, thus deepening our understanding of the processes that govern ocean life.

Whyte (born 11 July 1933 in Budapest; died 31 August 2012 in London) was an author, composer, dramatist and art collector. His early education was at Highgate Junior School. A British national of Hungarian Jewish extraction, the Holocaust and the loss of many members of his family in Auschwitz have influenced his creative works which have increasingly focused on the struggle against social injustices especially racism. Career A world authority on the Dreyfus Affair, his Dreyfus Trilogy, created for the Dreyfus Centenary in 1994 has been widely performed and televised. Making extensive use of archival material, he has evolved a powerful dramatic style defined by G√∂tz Friedrich as a 'Protokol f√ºr das Musiktheater' wherein the drama is heightened by opposing texts, repeatedly sung and declaimed, which confront the listener with an escalation of the moral conflict. His literary work 'The Dreyfus Affair ‚Äì A Chronological History' (publ. Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) is recognized as the major reference book on the subject. His latest creation 'Golem 13' was the cultural highlight of the Czech Presidency of the European Union (June 2009). It was premiered at the National Theatre of Prague and commemorated the 400th anniversary of the death of Rabbi Loew, the Maharal, credited with the creation of the Golem of Prague to defend the Jews of the Ghetto. In Golem 13, a Kabbalistic Drama in 2 Acts, (set to music by Noam Sheriff), Whyte dares a balancing act between the past and the future. The first act takes place in the 16th century, the second act, in the future, 500 years later, when the Jewish people, threatened once again, create Golem 13 for their protection. In this visionary work, there appears on the operatic stage, for the first time, a superhuman being composed of Kabbalistic spirituality and advanced technology, to be of eventual significance to all of mankind. Whyte readily collaborates with other composers and artistic talents and constructs his work so that it is adaptable for stage, television and radio. His administrative experience in the performing arts has contributed to the evolution of an artistic legacy largely devoted to the commemoration of the injustices suffered by the Jewish people. George Whyte was inter alia Chairman of the British National Export Council for the Arts (1967‚Äì1973); founder member of the international committee of the Artur Rubinstein Piano Competition (1976‚Äì1988) and Chairman of the Royal Opera House 'The Holocaust A Commemoration in Music' (1987/88). Since 1988 Whyte he has been the Chairman of cultural events at 'Remembering for the Future' (London). For over 20 years he has researched the Dreyfus Affair which has made him a world authority on the subject. Since 1998 he has been Chairman of the Dreyfus Society for Human Rights (London and Bonn). Publications George R. Whyte's works have been published by (inter alia) Palgrave Macmillan (UK and US), Inter Nationes, Artial and Coda Editions; distributed by Boosey & Hawkes Bote and Bock Berlin; his stage works have been premiered by the Deutsche Oper Berlin, Oper der Stadt Bonn, Theater Basel, New York City Opera, Opernhaus Z√ºrich, J√ºdisches Museum Berlin, National Theatre Prague and broadcast on numerous TV channels and radio networks, including WDR, Channel 4, CBS, France Culture, BBC, Sweden STV1, Slovenia RTV, SLO, Finland YLE and Hungary MTV .

With his father Barnett Salmanson (Salk) and brothers Samuel, Donald and Charles, Leonard I. Salmanson opened the family's first stores in 1932 under the name Adams Drug Company in Woonsocket and Pawtucket, Rhode Island, selling health and beauty aids and assorted sundries. Expansion and acquisitions produced one of the largest drugstore chains in the country, with over 500 stores in 14 states employing more than 5,000 people. Under Leonard's leadership, the Salmanson family also diversified into manufacturing and real estate holdings, purchasing the Gong Bell Mfg. Co., in East Hampton, Connecticut, a toy business, the Clover Bead & Jewelry Co., in Pawtucket, and the Colt Plastics Co., North Grosvernordale, Conn. Always seeking to attract new industry, the Salmanson family formed the Ivy Co. to purchase the former Raycrest Mills, in Pawtucket; Wanskuck Buildings Inc., to develop the former Wanskuck Mills, Providence; and the Drake Co., to buy and develop a industrial site on Webster Street in Pawtucket. Many trace Brooks Pharmacy's roots back to Adams Drug Company. At that time Adams acquired several hundred stores under the Brooks Drug banner in Vermont and New York, and also operated stores under several other different trade names throughout the Northeast. In 1984, Pantry Pride, a defunct Florida-based supermarket chain acquired the Adams Drug Company, which had then consisted of about 500 stores throughout the Northeast. The following year, all of Pantry Pride's assets including Adams, were acquired by corporate raider Ronald Perelman's Revlon subsidiary. Shortly after the Perelman acquisition, in 1986, all Adams stores were converted over to the Brooks trade name.

Content  The book's title comes from the fact that the Atari 2600, initially branded the VCS (Video Computer System), did not have a video frame buffer, and required the programmers to write each line of video to the television, one line at a time. As there were only a limited number of machine cycles in which to do this, the programmers were literally racing a high speed electron beam across the screen. Racing the Beam discusses the history of the VCS platform and the design decisions that impacted the types of games that could be written for it. Specific titles such as Combat, Pitfall! and Yars' Revenge are analyzed from a technical and cultural perspective. Racing the Beam is the first in a series of books on early video game platforms, and has been cited by modern Atari 2600 enthusiasts as an inspiration for attempting to write new games for the platform.

The historic building is located in Pocahontas, Iowa, United States. The parish served the Bohemian community that lived in the Pocahontas area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History The first Catholic Mass in Pocahontas was celebrated in 1875 by the Rev. T.M. Lenahan from Fort Dodge. The liturgies were celebrated irregularly in a schoolhouse until 1881. That year Pocahontas was organized as a mission of St. Patrick's on Lizard Creek in Webster County. The Rev. Mathew Norton started celebrating Mass once a month. At that time, the parishes in this area were in the Diocese of Dubuque. In 1882, Warrick Price donated three acres of land east of town for a church and cemetery. Will Hubbel designed the building and directed the construction by men of the local Bohemian community. Hubbel built almost all of the early buildings in Pocahontas. with The altar was built by Charles Andera of Spillville. Mary Payer donated the altar as well as a picture of St. Peter and St. Paul that was painted in Bohemia. The bells for the church, named Agnes and Joseph, were brought from St. Louis, Missouri. The first resident pastor, the Rev. J.P. Bronz, served the parish from 1891 to 1895. The rectory was built at this time. In 1894 the church building was moved from the Calvary Cemetery property on the east side of town to its current location west of the central business district. The church was enlarged and remodeled the following year. A school was begun by the parish in 1896, and the Sisters of St. Francis of the Holy Family from Dubuque served as the teachers. In 1901 Sacred Heart Parish was established in Pocahontas for the Germans and Irish, and school went with them. Saints Peter and Paul became a Bohemian national parish to serve that immigrant community, and it became a parish of the Sioux City diocese when it was established the following year. It was difficult, however, for the bishop to maintain a Bohemian-speaking priest in the parish. The Rev. Michael J. Kolvek was the pastor from 1923 to 1938, and the Rev. John Turza was the pastor from 1954 to 1957. The parish's other pastors could not speak the language. Renovations were made to the church in 1957 which included new floors, pews, altar, and communion rail. It was redecorated in 1964 and changes were made a couple years later which reflected the liturgical changes inspired by the Second Vatican Council. The altar was changed so the priest could face the congregation. By 1975 Pocahontas no longer needed two parishes, let alone a national parish for Bohemians. Bishop Frank Greteman merged both Saints Peter and Paul and Sacred Heart in Pocahontas into one parish named Resurrection of Our Lord. Both churches were initially used for liturgy. Saints Peter and Paul Church was permanently closed in 1983. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The last Mass in the church was held in 1997. Architecture The wood frame building measures and it features a three-story tower. It exhibits a combination of Italianate and Greek Revival elements. The Italianate influence is found in the round-arched windows and the paired brackets on the belfry. The Greek Revival is found in the fanlight over the main entrance; the pilastered corner boards and the fanlight motif on the upper section of the tower; and the lantern that caps the tower. Saints Peter and Paul is significant for several reasons. It was the first Catholic church in Pocahontas County, and its association with the Bohemian people who settled here. The church building is significant for its Italianate and Greek Revival design and its association with its builder, Will Hubbel. It is the last of the wood frame church buildings left in Pocahontas, and one of the last in the county.

In 2008, through the company's non-profit arm, the Meltwater Foundation, Lyseggen launched the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology in Accra, Ghana to provide entrepreneurial, software and business training to its Entrepreneurs in Training (EITs). In 2010, the company announced the release of Meltwater Press, a web-based media contact database that uses natural language processing technology to connect journalists with their most relevant covered topics. After the acquisitions of the Bangalore-based social media monitoring company, BuzzGain in 2010, and the CRM software developer JitterJam in February 2011, Meltwater released the social marketing and business intelligence tool Buzz Engage in June 2011. In August 2011, the company acquired the real-time social search engine, IceRocket, and integrated its functionality into its rebranded Buzz Engage platform, Meltwater Buzz. In 2015, the company launched a new media intelligence platform, called \\"Meltwater\\". In March 2016, Meltwater acquired the analytics startup, Encore Alert, and integrated its functionality into its Smart Alert product offering. In early 2017, Meltwater acquired Wrapidity, an Oxford University spin-out, to add AI to media monitoring capabilities automating extraction of data from unstructured web-based content. That same year, the company acquired the Hong Kong-based big data company Klarity, the media monitoring arm of the Postmedia Network, Infomart, the media monitoring company, Encore Alerts, and the data analysis startup, Cosmify. In August 2017, Meltwater acquired Algo in combination of cash and stock. In March 2018, Meltwater acquired DataSift. In April 2018, Meltwater acquired Sysomos.

Litigation  Meltwater has been involved in legal proceedings surrounding the legality of temporary copies and its online media clipping service. It was ruled unlawful in the United States under the \\"fair use\\" doctrine and lawful in the UK (under UK and EU copyright law). = In the United States = On March 21, 2013, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York rejected Meltwater's claims that its use of Web stories drawn from a scan of 162,000 news websites from more than 190 countries was a fair use of copyright-protected material, in a lawsuit brought by The Associated Press. All claims and counterclaims were dismissed in July 2013. = In the UK = The case revolved around whether a client lacking a license would infringe copyright by being shown, and viewing, the extracts from copyrighted material in this way (it was common ground that to subsequently view a full article would require a license). and was due to be heard in February 2011. In mid-March 2010, in an interim jurisdiction question the Copyright Tribunal ruled in favor of Meltwater and the Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA), with the NLA was ordered to pay the costs of the suit. However, on July 27, 2011, Meltwater lost upon appeal in the UK High Court. The decision was reversed in 2013 by the UK Supreme Court, which ruled Meltwater's activities legal‚Äîsubject to certain questions referred to the European Court of Justice intended to clarify matters of a cross-border nature. The rationale was that viewing of copyright works was not, and had never been, illegal in either the UK or European law, and Article 5.1 of the European Directive 2001/29/EC (which covers \\"temporary copies\\"]) permitted automated copying of a temporary nature for a lawful purpose. As mere viewing by Meltwater's clients was lawful under UK and EU law, the technical automated creation of temporary copies to enable and facilitate this were also lawful.

Biography Nikephoros is the first known member of the Palaiologos family, which would eventually rise to become the last ruling dynasty of the Byzantine Empire from 1259 to 1453. He had two sons, George and Nicholas. George Palaiologos also became a general and was one of the chief supporters of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118). Through George and his great-great-grandson Andronikos Palaiologos, the later Palaiologan dynasty draws its descent.. Nikephoros is first attested during the short reign of Romanos IV Diogenes (r. 1068‚Äì1071). A Doukas partisan, he was hostile to Romanos and a member of the opposition around the Caesar John Doukas and Michael Psellos.. After the fall of Romanos following the disastrous Battle of Manzikert (1071), Nikephoros was dispatched east against the Norman mercenary Roussel de Bailleul, who had rebelled against imperial rule. After gathering some 6,000 mercenaries in Georgia, he confronted Roussel, but his Georgian troops defected and he was defeated. In 1077, he is recorded as doux of Mesopotamia. Although loyal to the Doukas dynasty and Emperor Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071‚Äì1078), he did permit his son George to join the rebellion of Nikephoros Botaneiates, who became emperor as Nikephoros III (r. 1078‚Äì1081).. In 1081, he again remained loyal to Botaneiates when the Komnenoi under Alexios Komnenos rose up, even though his son George and the Doukai supported the Komnenian cause. According to Anna Komnene's Alexiad, father and son even met during the Komnenian forces' entry into Constantinople on 1 April 1081, in what Basile Skoulatos describes as one of the \\"most passionate\\" scenes of the work.. Even then, Nikephoros tried to induce Botaneiates to resist, urging him to give him command of the Varangian Guard and try to defend the imperial palace, but in vain. He then tried to mediate and proposed that Alexios be adopted by Botaneiates and assume de facto control over the Empire, while the latter would retain the honorary position of emperor, but at the insistence of Caesar John Doukas, the Komnenoi rejected this proposal. Eventually, Botaneiates abdicated.. Nikephoros accepted Alexios as his new emperor, and accompanied him in his campaign in the same year against the Normans under Robert Guiscard. He fought and died at the Battle of Dyrrhachium against Guiscard's forces on 18 October 1081.

In the 1870s, the Drummond mine was considered Canada's leading colliery. However, small fires were constantly erupting in the coal seams. On May 13, 1873 Fireman Robert McLeod started a small fire with gunpowder on a ledge of coal and attempted to extinguish it in the usual way, with a bucket of water. Unable to do so after 20 minutes and several buckets, he left and alerted the manager, James Dunn. When he returned, the blaze had grown beyond control. He ran for safety, just as the first explosion occurred, around 12:15. The first explosion killed and wounded many in the mine, including manager James Dunn. As miners on the surface were discussing the rescue of the injured, the second explosion occurred. This was far more powerful, acting with the force of a volcano. Towers of flame spewed miners, timber, and rocks from all the mine entrances. A closed older mine, the Campbell Workings, connected to the Drummond mine was also reopened by the blast. The second explosion was followed by others. The fire was finally contained and extinguished five days later by diverting streams into all openings, republished in and then filling them with gravel, clay and debris. Seventy men either died in the explosion or were sealed in the mine. Cause The causes are uncertain. A firedamp explosion, likely of hydrogen sulfide, that triggered off a coal dust explosion is most likely. The mine had been just re-opened following a strike, leading to a buildup of \\"foul air.\\" A coroner‚Äôs inquest ruled that the fire had followed from the use of gunpowder in the mine.

Plot Jay Mallory is a contract killer living in Montr√©al who works for an unknown international criminal organization. He returns home to his downtown apartment one cold winter day to find that his wife, Celandine, is gone without a trace. Mallory initially thinks that Celandine has left him on her own volition since their marriage was a sometimes stormy, albeit passionate, relationship. However, words from Mallory's main point of contact at the Organization, Burbank, indicate that Celandine's disappearance may be associated with Mallory's last hit. Shortly after their discussion, Burbank himself disappears. The Organization assigns Mallory another job in Suffolk, England. Mallory has a feeling that there is something unusual about this job - he is given little initial information including not knowing who the target is - and that it too is associated with Celandine's disappearance. Despite feeling that he may be being set up, Mallory decides to take the job anyway to see how it plays out and if it leads him back to Celandine. Mallory flies to London as instructed where he meets his new contact, Atkinson, who gives him the weapon to be used for the \\"shy\\" (a code-word the Organization uses to describe an assassination job) and the location and when it will take place. After renting a car and driving to rural Suffolk, Mallory begins to suspect the Organization plans to betray him since Burbank informed him earlier that the Organization often \\"retires\\" (kills) fellow members who are deemed no longer trustworthy or if they are felt to be no longer useful. After breaking into a large country house of his target, Mallory finds that his \\"shy\\" happens to be Deverell, the head of the Organization whom Mallory has never met. Deverell and his fellow aide Edward inform Mallory that they have been expecting him to show up and reveal that Celandine has been having an affair with Deverell behind Mallory's back the entire time and that she just left England the day before that Mallory arrived and that she may have orchestrated the entire \\"shy\\". When Deverell attempts to kill Mallory for knowing too much, Mallory succeeds in killing him and Edward instead and flees to London where he takes the first flight back to Canada. After arriving back at his apartment in Montr√©al, Mallory finds Celandine back where after confronting her, she admits to him that she indeed was involved with Deverell out of frustration to their failing marriage and she also, through the Organization's various channels and middle men, planned for Mallory to assassinate Deverell so she could be free from him and that Mallory could be free from the Organization. Mallory seems to accept this and he and Celandine make love. The next morning, Mallory wakes up confident and decides to cook Celandine breakfast, but after seeing that he does not have enough food in his refrigerator he leaves the apartment alone to go food shopping. A little later, as Mallory returns to his apartment, carrying a large brown paper bag filled with groceries, he stumbles along the balcony outside his apartment to look for his apartment keys when an unseen sniper shoots at him but misses. When a surprised Mallory looks around trying to locate the sniper, the unseen marksman opens fire again and hits Mallory again in his chest with the second bullet, killing him instantly. In the final images, as Mallory lies dead outside the door to his apartment, Celandine sits alone inside the apartment with a calm look on her face, and ending the film with many more questions then answers (i.e.; Who killed Mallory?; The new leaders of the Organization? Deverell's family? An unknown third party? Did Celandine have anything to do with Mallory's murder?, etc.).

Nordstern (en: \\"North Star\\"), often erroneously referred to as Neu Drontheim (en: \\"New Trondheim\\"), was the Nazi plan for the creation of a new German metropolis in German-occupied Norway during World War II. It was planned to have a population of around 250,000‚Äì300,000 inhabitants.Spotts, p. 331. The building site of the city was located southwest of the Norwegian city of Trondheim. Because of the significant strategic importance of Trondheim Fjord to the German military, it was to be constructed in conjunction with a major navy and military base that would give Germany unprecedented maritime control over the North Atlantic area, a move strongly supported by Gro√üadmirals Erich Raeder and Karl D√∂nitz.Thomas, Charles S.: The German Navy in the Nazi Era. Naval Institute Press, 1990. Adolf Hitler stated that the city was to become \\"a German Singapore\\", and it eventually became one of his favorite architectural projects.Spotts, p. 33.Rothwell, Victor: War Aims in the Second World War: the War Aims of the Major Belligerents 1939‚Äì45, page 37. Edinburgh University Press, 2005. During the war itself, the port city was already turned into a major base for German U-Boat submarines, Dora I.The German Northern Theater of Operations 1940‚Äì1945 Strategic importance The conquest of Norway by the Wehrmacht presented the military leadership of the Third Reich with new opportunities for expansion. The city of Trondheim and its accompanying bay were determined to be very favorably located strategically for several reasons. Prior to the outbreak of war, the retired Vizeadmiral and naval strategist Wolfgang Wegener had already long stressed the strategic benefits that acquiring bases along the Norwegian coastline would give Germany.Murray, Williamson; Knox, MacGregor; Bernstein, Alvin H. The Making of Strategy: Rulers, States, and War, pp 365‚Äì366. One notable example of these benefits is the case of the battleship , which had to be continually moved back to Germany for any additional repairs that she required. Due to her sheer size, there were simply no other docks in the north large enough to accommodate her.Zetterling, Niklas; Tamelander, Michael: Tirpitz: The Life and Death of Germany's Last Super Battleship. Casemate Publishers, 2009. After the failure of the Luftwaffe to subdue Great Britain in the Battle of Britain by airpower alone, it was recognized that the fight for the British Isles would have to be fought and won at sea. Furthermore, it would be of major importance if the Kriegsmarine were to pursue any farther-reaching operations in the Atlantic in the near future, for instance if the United States were to engage in war with it. These and other motivations‚Äîsuch as Swedish iron ore shipments from Narvik‚Äîled the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW) to classify the possession of Norway in general and Trondheim in particular as strategically vital to the German war effort. History Preparatory work on the possibility of turning the bay around Trondheim into a new German naval base was already started at the F√ºhrer Headquarters before the project was officially commissioned by Hitler in 1941. As a permanent German possession, it was acknowledged that some arrangements would have to be made for its resident seamen and their accompanying families. Hitler concluded that this new harbor would make the construction of an accompanying city inevitable, with living accommodations for 250,000 inhabitants. He dubbed the new settlement Nordstern (\\"Northern Star\\"). To organize and carry out the necessary planning for the new project, Hitler appointed Albert Speer, at the time his favorite architect and later Minister of Armaments in his Cabinet.Speer, Albert: Inside the Third Reich, page 260. Macmillan Compamny, 1970. On 1 May 1941, Speer received the necessary information on the spatial and structural requirements for a large shipyard from Vizeadmiral of the Oberkommando der Marine (Naval High Command; OKM). He reported to Hitler on the project at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, accompanied by Gro√üadmiral Erich Raeder on 21 June. During this meeting, Hitler determined the precise building site for the city, while also deciding that a large, sub-surface submarine base was to be blasted into the granite cliffs. He further discussed the future city and its military base during an armaments conference on 13 May 1942. In 1943, the first ground detonations were begun. To provide the construction site with labor, a prisoner-of-war camp was built in √òysand. A reserve landing strip for airplanes was also put in place. Special maps were prepared for Hitler from which he studied the optimum positions for the docks and accompanying structures. A metres-wide, highly detailed miniature model was also built for him, which was destroyed during an Allied bombardment in Berlin in 1945. =Abandonment of the project= After the course of the war turned against Germany, construction was eventually stopped and put on indefinite hold. After the destruction of the Tirpitz in November 1944, most of the naval leadership was sacked and the plan abandoned permanently. The few existing remains of the concrete foundations can still be seen on the shores of Trondheim Fjord.√Öldstedt, Finn: Hitlers dr√∏m om Trondheim. Adressa, published 1 September 2006. (In Norwegian). Retrieved 9 August 2010. Location, size and plans It was decided that the city was to be built in the wetlands of √òysand, to the southwest of Trondheim. It was supposed to provide living quarters for about 300,000 German inhabitants (more than three times the size of 1940s Trondheim), and for this purpose 55,000 residential houses were to be built on an area of approximately 300 ha. The city was also to house an enormous art museum for the northern part of Germany‚Ä≤s empire, containing \\"only works of German masters\\".Weinberg, Gerhard L. (2005). Visions of Victory: the Hopes of Eight World War II Leaders, page 26. Cambridge University Press. An Autobahn was to be constructed to Trondheim across the Little and Great Belts of Denmark and further through southwest Sweden and Norway to connect the northern outpost with Germany proper.Weinberg, page 27. The naval base itself was planned to contain extensive shipyards, docks and U-Boat bases for the expected post-war German navy that was to consist altogether of several hundred submarines and dozens of super-battleships, as well as several aircraft carriers. It would, in Hitler's words, render British Singapore \\"mere child‚Ä≤s play\\" by comparison as a military stronghold.Irving, David (1977). Hitler's War. Viking Press. Atlantic Wall As one of Germany‚Ä≤s most important naval bases in the anticipated near future, the city played an important role in German schemes for a massively enlarged version of the Atlantic Wall. During the Nuremberg Trials, it was admitted that Hitler intended to retain not only Trondheim, but also numerous other maritime cities such as Brest and Cherbourg in France as German exclaves (Festungen, i.e. \\"strongholds\\") for the Third Reich, similar to the Soviet military base temporarily established in the Finnish town of Hanko after the Winter War. Nordstern would therefore be one among many military quasi-colonies with almost exclusively German inhabitants. Together with other cities and island chains in both Europe and Africa, it was to form part of a string of German military bases that would span the entire Atlantic coastline from Norway all the way to the Belgian Congo. This was to assist Germany with the re- establishment of a large overseas colonial domain in Central Africa known as Mittelafrika, and was also intended for both offensive and defensive operations against the Western Hemisphere, specifically the United States.

Beijing government Wen Shizhen graduated from the Beiyang Naval College () in 1898. He served for 4 years in the Chinese Navy as a lieutenant while he went to the United Kingdom for training. Later he transferred to the staff of Li Hongzhang. In 1906 he was appointed a secretary for foreign affairs to the Viceroy of Liangguang. In 1913 Wen Shizhen was appointed advisor in foreign affairs to the Military Governor (Dudu; ) Zhejiang. In 1916 he was given an additional post as High Diplomatic Advisor to the Military Governor Jiangxi Li Chun (). In August 1917 Li Chun became Military Governor Jiangsu; Wen accompanied him. In October 1920 he was appointed Superintendent of Customs of Nanjing. The next month he became concurrently Commissioner of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing. The next year he became a member of the Chinese Delegation to the Washington Naval Conference as the honorary councilor. In 1923 Wen Shizhen was treated as an ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. With the Zhili clique's support, Wen was appointed Commissioner of Foreign Affairs and concurrently Superintendent of Customs of Shanghai in September 1924. That year the Zhili clique was beaten by the Fengtian clique in the Second Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War, and Wen was invited by the Fengtian clique's Military Governor Yang Yuting. Later the National Revolutionary Army occupied Shanghai, so Wen defected to Japan, and retired from political life for a while.

Wen also participated in it, and was appointed Superintendent of Customs of Tianjin, Inspector of the Bank of Hebei Province, and Chairperson of the Arranging Commission for tariffs, etc. At that time Pan Yugui () was appointed Mayor of Tianjin Special City. However, his birthplace was not Tianjin, so the leading figures of Tianjin and the Japanese Special Service Agency of Tianjin did not want to support him. While Wen Shizhen was born in Tianjin, his work was better than Pan's, so he won support with people in the political circle.

It is located on the hill of Gretta (Poggio di Gretta), off the Strada del Friuli. At a height of it is one of the tallest lighthouses in the world. History The idea to raise a monument in the vicinity arose during World War I, following capture of Kobarid in the Battles of the Isonzo and following the Battle of the Piave River. Originally the lighthouse was to rise on the coast of Istria, near Pula. However, the location eventually chosen was the hill of Gretta, due to ideal height (60m above sea-level) and the solid foundations of the former Austrian fort Kressich, built between 1854 and 1857. The lighthouse plans took shape following the end of the war, in December 1918. It was designed by Triestine architect Arduino Berlam. One of the reasons for building such a high monument was the desire to build a victory monument higher than the Berlin Victory Column, which was high at the time. Work started only in 1923 and ended on May 24, 1927 with the inauguration in the presence of King Vittorio Emanuele III. The structure celebrates the Italian victory and commemorates the fallen of the first world war, as testified by the inscription \\"SPLENDI E RICORDA I CADUTI SUL MARE MCMXV-MCMXVIII\\" (shine and remind of the fallen on sea 1915-1918). In 1979 the lighthouse was closed for restoration for seven years, and was reopened to the public May 18, 1986. Structure The large base of the lighthouse includes the earthwork of the Austrian fort. The bottom of structure is covered by stone from Carso (specifically from Gabrie) and the top is covered by stone from Istria (specifically from Vrsar). It weighs about and construction involved the use of of stone (or ), of concrete and of iron. Above the column is a capital and a crow's nest, in which the bronze crystal cage of the lantern is inserted. The cage is topped by a copper dome with a scale-like motif, on top of which is the statue of winged victory by sculptor Giovanni Mayer, made of embossed copper and weighing about . A statue of a seaman, also by sculptor Giovanni Mayer, adorns the front of the lighthouse, made from of stone from Vrsar, under which is the anchor of the destroyer Audace, the first Italian ship to enter the port of Trieste on November 3, 1918, is attached. Two projectiles of the Austrian battleship SMS Viribus Unitis are placed on both sides of the lighthouse entry. The light itself is an electrical light since its first lighting. The current light is a 1000 watt halogen bulb. Visiting The site of the lighthouse is open to the public. The lighthouse itself is open Saturday and Sunday 3 pm to 7 pm, from the last Saturday of April to the second Sunday of October. Reaching the top requires climbing 285 steps.

He was the younger brother of the actor Francis Aickin (died 1803) with whom he shared the stage at the Edinburgh Theatre before he gave offence to his public by his protest against the discharge of a fellow-actor. He therefore went to London, and from 1767 to 1800 was a member of the Drury Lane Company and for some years a deputy manager. He quarrelled with John Philip Kemble, with whom, in 1792, he fought a bloodless duel. Biography James Aickin was the younger brother of actor Francis Aickin, and like him brought up to be a weaver. After joining a company strolling through Ireland, and gaining some experience of the stage, he embarked for Scotland, and presently accepted an engagement to appear at the Edinburgh Theatre. He was very favourably received, and gradually, from his merit as an actor and his sensible deportment in private life, became the head of the Canongate Company, playing most of the leading parts in tragedy and comedy. In January 1767 a riot took place in the Edinburgh Theatre because of the discharge by the management of one Stanley, an actor of small merit, in whom, however, a section of the public took extraordinary interest. The inside of the building was demolished, the furniture ransacked, and the fixtures destroyed. It was not until troops from Edinburgh Castle had come to the relief of the city guard that the rioters were dispersed, and the theatre saved from further injury. James Aickin, who had particularly offended the rioters, left Edinburgh, and, accepting an engagement at Drury Lane, made his first appearance there in December 1767 as Colonel Camply in Kenrick's comedy The Widowed Wife. He continued a member of the 'Drury Lane company, with occasional appearances at the Haymarket Theatre during the summer months, until his retirement in 1800. He was for some years one of the deputy managers of Drury Lane, and was reputed to be a useful and pleasing actor, easy, graceful, and natural of manner. \\"His forte lay in the representation of an honest steward or an affectionate parent\\". Boaden states that while the tones of his voice were among \\"the sweetest that ever met the ear\\", he was not happy in his temper. In 1792 he took offence at some of John Kemble's managerial arrangements, was personally rude to him, and challenged him to a duel. The actors met in \\"some field in Marylebone\\", a third actor, Charles Bannister, undertaking the duties of second to both combatants. Aickin discharged his pistol, but fortunately missed his manager, who declined to fire in return; a reconciliation was then accomplished. Kemble afterwards explained that \\"he saw from his adversary's levelling at him that he was in no danger\\".

Synopsis According to Dread Central, the producers claim the film will \\"introduce the accurate mythological concept of the jinn to Western audiences\\". Plot In 1901, a man enters a shack in the forest to confront a jinn sitting, waiting for him, and he starts to recite an Arabic prayer to establish a layer of protection for himself as he nears. The man has only one request, the release of girl being kept hostage by the Jinn, but the jinn refuses to answer and attacks him. After a struggle, the man throws holy water on the jinn. The jinn swears vengeance and states that he will slaughter all of his blood-line from one generation to another. 113 years later, Shawn and Jasmine are a happy couple living in Michigan. Shawn gets a delivery, an early birthday present of a note and VHS tape. Later, he tells his wife about the promotion at his job, and that he thinks they're ready to have their first child, but Jasmine tells him that it's impossible for her to have children, upsetting Shawn. He leaves to think, and in his office he watches the VHS tape. The tape was recorded by his father, with the message that strange things might start happening to him, and he must seek out the helpers who will get him ready to fight the unknown forces. His Father also states that if this tape has managed to reach him, that means he has failed to defeat these forces and protect his family, and that Shawn will now need to prevail in this battle to ensure survival of his family. When he gets home, he finds the furniture stacked up and his wife missing. He calls the police but Jasmine arrives, to his relief. When more odd things begin happening at home, the couple meets Father Westhoff and Gabriel, who explain the concept of jinn to them. Shawn doesn't believe this, but is prompted by Father Westhoff to visit his adoptive parents. He does so and is surprised to have Father Westhoff's story corroborated. They are then attacked by an unseen force that takes Jasmine. Shawn sets off with Gabriel to gather information from Ali, Shawn's estranged uncle. As Ali is of the same bloodline, the Jinns have tormented him, and his failure to defeat the Jinns has driven him mad. Ali, through his supernatural power, shows Shawn that his wife is pregnant. Ali warn Shawn that to save himself and his family, he will have to pass the Chilla (Physical, Mental & Spiritual test) and defeat the Jinns. Ali senses that the jinn has been spying on them and is there to attack him. As they flee, Gabriel sacrifices himself for Shawn. It is revealed that Gabriel is a jinn, though he dies in the fight with the other jinn. Now relying solely on Father Westhoff for help, Shawn finds out the reason the jinn are after him, and Father Westhoff sends him on a quest to learn how to defeat the jinn. Shawn manages to draw the jinn to a scheduled place for their final battle. The Jinns try several physical tortures and mental deceptions, but Shawn manages to survive the Chilla, and he must next confront the main jinn from his great-grandfather's clash over 100 years ago. Ali fights alongside him, but it appears the jinn is only toying with them. Eventually, though, Shawn finally defeats the jinn. Jinns from different dimensions come and ask Shawn for peace but Shawn wants them to leave him alone. He kills one of them as a warning to the others. Father Westhoff shows him that Jasmine is safe in the church, along with the now revived Gabriel. A year later, Shawn, Jasmine, and Ali are at the apartment with the couple's new baby boy. The baby drops his pacifier, and as Ali and Shawn both bend down to pick it up, it moves to the baby's mouth without being touched. They look at each other, knowing that the child has the power to defeat the jinn once and for all.

Some of the shooting for the film occurred at the University of Michigan Law Quad. The film was released on April 4, 2014. Reception Critical reception of Jinn was negative, with a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 18% based on 11 reviews. The film also has a Metacritic score of 24 out of 100, based on five reviews. Joe Leydon of Variety commented on his review that \\"This ponderously paced, needlessly convoluted and altogether unexceptional thriller will be fortunate to reach beyond a thin sliver of undiscriminating genre fans with its bogus mythos about ancient evil spirits bent on world domination.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote on his review that \\"despite the exoticism of its mythology, Jinn proves itself a typically formulaic B-movie exercise that will have little resonance for those unfamiliar with its inspiration.\\" Peter Keough of The Boston Globe wrote: \\"With its awful acting, terrible dialogue, and laughable special effects, Jinn strains for the hapless genius of Ed Wood, but ends up just another bad movie.\\" References External links  * * Category:2014 films Category:2010s action thriller films Category:American action films Category:American films Category:American thriller films Category:2010s chase films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Michigan Category:Genies in film Category:American supernatural thriller films ","title":"Jinn (2014 film)"},{"id":"28308017","text":"Front view of the palazzo Palazzo dei Congressi (formally: Palazzo dei Ricevimenti e dei Congressi) is a building located in the EUR district of Rome, Italy.

He spent the last years of his life in Liverpool, where he designed the Wellington Rooms. Life Aikin came from a Unitarian background. He was the youngest son of Dr. John Aikin, M.D., and was born on 2 October 1780 at Warrington. Arthur Aikin and Charles Rochemont Aikin were his brothers, the writer Lucy Aikin was his sister, and Anna Barbauld was his aunt. In 1784 the family moved to Great Yarmouth, where his father practised as a doctor, and then, in 1792, to Broad Street Buildings in London. Aikin suffered from a speech impediment and was educated almost entirely at home by his parents. He was articled to a builder and surveyor, and following his apprenticeship, set up in business as an architect and surveyor on his own account. Two early designs were for nonconformist chapels in London. In 1808, he designed one in Jewin Street, off Aldersgate Street in the City of London, where Abraham Rees was minister for many years. includes an illustration of the chapel The next year he designed the New Gravel Pit Chapel in Hackney, for the Rev. Robert Aspland, producing plans for a rectangular building with an octagonal roof and seating plan. The foundation stone was laid on 16 October 1809, and it opened on 4 November 1810. Aikin took no fee for the work. R. Brook Aspland (p.230) comments that \\"[Aikin's] intended liberality, however, proved, as it generally does in such cases, very costly to the society. To exercise a watchful and stringent economy in respect to an architect who gives his plans and labour, is ungracious and impracticable. In 1806 he was a founder-member of the London Architectural Society. In 1810 he published a set of designs for villas, preceded by a long introduction in which he criticised the use of the Gothic style in domestic architecture, proposing instead the use of a kind of eastern, or Islamic style, inspired by the buildings shown in Thomas Daniell's Views in India. In 1812 he presented his Essay on the Doric Order to the London Architectural Society. He also wrote an account of St. Paul's Cathedral to accompany a set of drawings by James Elmes, articles about architecture for Abraham Rees Cyclopaedia, and a section on architecture for his sister Lucy's book about the reign of Elizabeth I. He exhibited designs at the Royal Academy between 1804 and 1814. He worked as an assistant to Sir Samuel Bentham, the architect of the Millbank Penitentiary, who was then engaged on works in progress at the Royal Navy's dockyards at Sheerness and Portsmouth, and published designs, made in collaboration with Bentham, for a bridge over the River Swale. The Admiralty had refused funding for Aikin 's post. To Bentham's suggestion that \\"more attention should be paid than hitherto has been in regard to the works of my department, particularly those relative to the dockyards, to the giving them an appropriate beauty and grandeur of appearance\\", they had replied that they were \\"not aware of any buildings or works ordered to be taken in hand which require any particular beauty or grandeur of appearance, and therefore cannot comply with the request of the civil architect and engineer, who has already sufficient assistance to carry on the duties of his office.\\" Instead Bentham employed him, and a draughtsman directly for several months, at his own cost. In around 1814, his Neoclassical designs for the Wellington Assembly Rooms in Liverpool having been accepted by the committee in charge of the project, he moved to the city to supervise their construction. He was based there for the rest of his life. He oversaw the adaptation of an existing mansion as premises for the Liverpool Royal Institution ‚Äì his alterations including the addition of a stone portico ‚Äì and built a number of villas in the area, some, against his natural inclinations, in the fashionable Gothic style. The short biography of Edmund Aikin is described as \\"originally composed for insertion in a collection of Lives of English Architects, which has not yet been given to the public.\\" He died at his father's house at Stoke Newington on 11 March 1820.

The season aired on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm ET, following Buffy.  Origins  Series co-creator David Greenwalt points out \\"there's no denying that Angel grew out of Buffy\\". Several years before Angel debuted, Joss Whedon developed the concept behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer to invert the Hollywood formula of \\"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie.\\" The character Angel was first seen in the first episode of Buffy and became a regular, appearing in the opening credits during seasons two and three. After being turned into a soulless, immortal vampire, he became legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him by restoring his soul, overwhelming him with guilt. Angel eventually set out on a path of redemption, hoping that he could make up for his past through good deeds. In Buffy's season three finale, he leaves Sunnydale for L.A. to continue his atonement without Buffy. Whedon believed that \\"Angel was the one character who was bigger than life in the same way that Buffy was, a kind of superhero.\\" Whedon has compared the series to its parent, \\"It's a little bit more straightforward action show and a little bit more of a guys' show.\\" While the central concept behind Buffy was \\"High school as a horror movie\\" in small-town America, co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make Angel into a different \\"gritty, urban show.\\" Whedon explains \\"we wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It is set in Los Angeles because there are a lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the show a little older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It's those two things that creatively make the shows different.\\" Whedon and Greenwalt prepared a six-minute promotional video pitch, often called the \\"Unaired Angel pilot\\" for the WB Network. Some shots from this short were later used in the opening credits. Early during the life of the series, some effort was made to slightly soften the original concept. For example, scenes were cut from the pilot episode, \\"City of,\\" in which Angel tasted the blood of a murder victim. The episode that was originally written to be the second episode, \\"Corrupt\\" was abandoned altogether. Writer David Fury explains, \\"The network was shocked. They said 'We can't shoot this. This is way too dark.' We were able to break a new idea, we had to turn it over in three days.\\" Instead the tone was lightened, and the opening episodes established Angel Investigations as an idealistic shoestring operation. A first draft script reveals that Angel was originally intended to include the character Whistler, played by Max Perlich, who had already featured in the two-part Buffy season two finale. In an interview, Perlich said, \\"I never got called again. If they had called, I would have probably accepted because it was a great experience and I think Joss is very original and talented.\\" Instead, the producers created a Whistler-like character, Doyle. Cordelia Chase, also from the original Sunnydale crew, joined Angel and Doyle.  Season synopsis  At the end of the third season of Buffy, the 242-year-old, re-ensouled vampire Angel left Sunnydale to give teenage Slayer Buffy Summers the chance to live a normal life. Angel is now living in the big city of Los Angeles. With Buffy gone Angel is now completely cut off from society, every day getting closer and closer to giving in to his vampiric hunger. It's not until he befriends the half demon and fellow Irishman Doyle, who is sent visions of people in trouble by The Powers That Be, and fellow Sunnydale resident Cordelia Chase, who grounds Angel's life in the humanity around him, that he truly begins to take charge of his life and seek atonement for his past sins. He sets up his own detective agency, Angel Investigations and begins to \\"help the helpless\\". Early in the season, Angel befriends a detective named Kate Lockley who at first helps and befriends Angel but turns on him after she finds out what he truly is. As the season comes to a close, Angel gains a semi-ally in the form of a street smart vampire hunter named Charles Gunn who will officially join the team early in the next season. Throughout the year Angel and co. are frequently set upon by the demonic law firm Wolfram & Hart, and the antics of two up and coming lawyers Lindsey McDonald and Lilah Morgan, who have secret plans concerning the vampire with a soul and the role he plays in the forthcoming apocalypse. In \\"I Will Remember You\\" Buffy comes to L.A. during which Angel is cured of his vampirism by the blood of a Mohra demon. He and Buffy then share the perfect day they always dreamed of together. However, Angel asks the Oracles to reverse time so that he can continue to help people in need realizing that he cannot protect the world as a normal human man. He subsequently gives up the one thing he ever truly loved to continue fighting the good fight. A few days later Doyle sacrifices his life as an act of redemption when he saves the lives of a family of half demon refugees. Before he dies he gives Cordelia a long-awaited kiss as the two had slowly been building a relationship all year and passes the godly visions on to her. In his place, ex-watcher Wesley Wyndam-Pryce arrives and aids the team with his extensive knowledge of demonology and the occult. In the two-parter, \\"Five by Five\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\", the rogue Slayer, Faith shows up in L.A. and is contracted by Wolfram & Hart to kill Angel. After torturing Wesley she ends up breaking down in Angel's arms, screaming at him to kill her. She eventually admits to the many crimes she has committed and hands herself in to the police. Seeing someone else so willingly seek redemption allows Angel to re- affirm his role and to willingly cut himself off from Buffy. Angel also develops a friendship with Faith, sharing a powerful bond which would eventually be pivotal in their future alliances. During the season finale Angel comes across an ancient prophecy that concerns his fate. Wolfram & Hart summon the demon Vocah to \\"destroy all avenues to The Powers That Be\\" and summon forth an ancient, terrible evil; Angel's sire, Darla. Wesley finishes translating the prophecy and learns that the word Shanshu means to both live and die informing Angel that if he truly saves the world he will be made human again and his burdens will be forever lifted. Meanwhile, the Angel Investigations offices are blown up forcing the gang to work out of Cordelia's apartment who, after having seen all the pain that infests Los Angeles, has vowed to up her stance in the fight against evil and become a better person.

Greenwalt wrote the most episodes, writing or co-writing five episodes and contributing stories for two other episodes. Tim Minear was hired from the offset and wrote or co-wrote five episodes throughout the season and served as producer and then promoted to supervising producer midseason. He was also the first original Angel writer to write an episode; the first five scripts of the series were all written by Buffy veterans; Whedon, Greenwalt, Jane Espenson, Douglas Petrie and David Fury. Buffy writer/producer Marti Noxon served as consulting producer and did several uncredited rewrites, and co-wrote one episode with Greenwalt. The rest of writing staff included producer Tracey Stern, staff writer Jeannine Renshaw, and consulting producer Howard Gordon (who also served as consulting producer on Buffy season two). After Gordon departed to work on a new pilot, Jim Kouf joined as consulting producer. Garry Campbell was hired to write a freelance episode. Whedon wrote and directed one episode throughout the season, the series premiere \\"City of\\", due to him working on two shows at once. He did however write the story for another two episodes; \\"I Fall to Pieces with David Greenwalt and \\"Sanctuary\\" with Tim Minear. Veteran Buffy director James A. Contner (also co-producer) directed the highest number of episodes in the first season, directing four episodes. David Greenwalt directed two, including the season finale. Episodes = Crossovers with Buffy the Vampire Slayer = Beginning with this season, both Angel and its parent series Buffy the Vampire Slayer aired on The WB Television Network. Both shows aired on Tuesdays, Buffy at 8:00 PM ET, and Angel at 9:00 PM ET. The first season of Angel aired along with the fourth season of Buffy. Both shows would feature crossover episodes where characters would appear on the other show. Along with the title character Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) appeared as main characters on the new series. The first crossover appeared in the premiere episodes, where Angel calls Buffy but doesn't say anything; on Buffy, she answers the phone. After the events of the Buffy episode \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\", Oz (Seth Green) visits Los Angeles in \\"In the Dark\\" to give Angel the Gem of Amarra (a ring that makes a vampire invincible). Spike (James Marsters) also appears in both episodes. In the \\"Bachelor Party\\", Doyle (Glenn Quinn) has a vision of Buffy in danger. This causes Angel to secretly visit Sunnydale in the Buffy episode \\"Pangs\\", to protect her. After Buffy is made aware that he was in town, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) visits L.A. in \\"I Will Remember You\\" to express her displeasure in him visiting but not telling her. Buffy season three recurring character Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) makes his first appearance on Angel in \\"Parting Gifts\\" and would later become a main character for the remainder of the series. After the events of the two-part Buffy episodes \\"This Year's Girl\\" and \\"Who Are You\\", Faith (Eliza Dushku) leaves Sunnydale and goes to L.A. in the Angel two-part episode \\"Five by Five\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" and is hired by Wolfram & Hart to kill Angel. Buffy makes her second and final appearance on Angel in \\"Sanctuary\\". Angel visits Sunnydale again in the Buffy episode \\"The Yoko Factor\\" to apologize to Buffy after the way he treated her in \\"Sanctuary.\\" Angel has a tense confrontation with Buffy's new boyfriend, Riley Finn (Marc Blucas). Buffy recurring character, the vampire Darla (Julie Benz), who was killed in the Buffy episode \\"Angel\\" is resurrected by Wolfram & Hart in the season one finale, \\"To Shanshu in L.A.\\". = Unproduced episode = The original second episode was supposed to be \\"Corrupt\\", an episode written by David Fury. The episode featured the introduction of Kate Lockley, who was originally going to be an undercover cop exploring prostitution who becomes addicted to cocaine and becomes a prostitute in the process of her undercover work. The WB shut down production on the episode before filming as they believed the episode's content was too dark.  Reception  The first season has a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 8 out 10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Angel builds on the solid sex appeal of its lead, forging an unexpectedly worthy spinoff that draws viewers in with character depth, clever humor, and a suitably dark and brooding backdrop.\\" On Metacritic, the season scored 75 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". David Boreanaz won the Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television, while the show was nominated for Best Network Television Series and Charisma Carpenter was nominated for Best Supporting Actress on Television.

In 2011 it had a population of 3,573. History =Early history= Close to Passo Corese is the site of Cures Sabinorum, also called simply Cures. According to Roman historians, it was from here that the Sabine king Titus Tatius marched on Rome, in the seventh year of the city, 747 BC, to avenge the Rape of the Sabine Women, and then agreed to settle in Rome. In the time of Augustus, Cures was merely a village, but it developed in the succeeding centuries, becoming in the 5th and 6th centuries the seat of a diocese, five of whose bishops are known by name because of their participation in synods or because of correspondence with the popes. The Lombards destroyed Cures, probably in 589, and the population dispersed. In a letter of February 593, Pope Gregory the Great ended the existence of the diocese as a residential see, adding its territory to that of Nomentum.Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica, vol. 19, pp. 27‚Äì28Francesco Lanzoni, Le diocesi d'Italia dalle origini al principio del secolo VII (an. 604), vol.

Cohen in 1976 with the mission of fostering the creation of personal relationships between Israel's Arabs and Jews, with the goal of creating greater understanding and promoting peace. After five Arab citizens of Israel were killed in Nazareth by Israeli security forces during the Land Day protest on March 30, 1976, Cohen's congregants from Congregation Mishkan Israel, Hamden, Connecticut provided funding for a mission to Israel for Cohen to promote peace. While on his trip to Israel, he met Agbaria, an Israeli Arab who shared Cohen's vision of peace-building, and the two co- founded Interns for Peace. Initially the group trained American college students, but shifted over the years to training Arabs and Jews from Israel. Interns for Peace aims to foster peace through building personal connections between Arabs and Jews, with Cohen noting that \\"every time you create contact it's successful because it breaks stereotypes\\".Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Rabbi Bruce M.

Models included a sport coupe using a semi-fastback roofline shared with other B-body GM cars, custom coupe with the formal roofline from the Caprice, four-door sedan, four-door hardtop sport sedan, and a convertible, - each of which rode on a new 121.5-inch wheelbase and measured 217 inches overall. Station wagons rode on a longer 125-inch wheelbase. History =Overview= The 1971 redesigned B-body would be the largest car ever offered by Chevrolet. All 1971 Chevrolet engines featured lower compression ratios to permit the use of regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline of at least 91 Research octane per GM corporate mandate in anticipation of the catalytic converters planned for 1975 and later models which necessitated the use of unleaded fuel. A high-performance big block V8 was available in the form of the Turbo-Jet 454, which produced 365 hp in 1971, but power decreased as the years went along. The 1970s marked the impact of the 1973 energy crisis with gasoline prices doubling from 1973 through 1979 and industry car sales plummeted 20 percent between 1973 and 1974. For the first time in recent history, annual passenger car travel in the U.S. declined. The Impala's sales dropped to 176,376 units in 1975, the weakest since its introduction in 1958. An Econominder gauge package was offered for 1975 and 1976 models.The Editors of Consumer Guide =1971= 1971 Impala models offered the same body styles as previous years. Newly standard features included power front disc brakes, inside hood release, and a revised Astro- Ventilation system that utilized air distribution grills in the trunklid. The new body featured a double panel roof for improved rollover protection and flush exterior door handles - both features previously introduced on the 1970¬Ω Camaro. 1971 Impala Sport Coupe Engine offerings included the base 145-horsepower, 250 cubic-inch Turbo Thrift six-cylinder (available only on the Impala four-door sedan as well as the lower-line Biscayne and Bel Air sedans) and 245-horsepower 350 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 (standard on Impala Sport Sedan, Sport Coupe, Custom Coupe, convertible and Kingswood wagon, and optional on the sedan). Optional engines included the 255-horsepower 400 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 (the standard Caprice and Kingswood Estate engine), 300-horsepower 400 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8 and 365-horsepower 454 cubic-inch V-8. Early in the model year, all Impalas came standard with three-speed column shift manual transmissions and manual steering as standard equipment, with power steering and one of two automatic transmissions optional. During the first months of the model year, the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission was optional with all engines while the two-speed Powerglide could be ordered with the 250 6 or 350 V-8s. At mid-year the Turbo-Hydramatic and variable-ratio power steering became standard equipment on all V-8 powered full-sized Chevrolets. Station wagons featured a 'clamshell' design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), dropped below the load floor. The power tailgate, the first of its kind, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate which required marked effort to lift from storage. This design was shared with other full- sized GM wagons from Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick. Subsequent generations reverted to the door-gate style for its full-size wagons. As expected, 1971 Impala production was well below 1970 totals due to the 67-day corporate wide strike at General Motors that began in September, 1970 after initial 1971-model production began and would not end until November. Impala production ended up at 427,000 units including 2,300 with six-cylinder engines and 425,400 with V8 with other series production totals including Caprice, 91,300; Biscayne, 37,600; Bel Air, 20,000; and station wagons (all series), 91,300. =1972= 1972 Chevrolet Impala Sport Sedan The 1972 Impala introduced a lower height grille which extended below the bumper and revised taillights now set in the bumper. 1972 saw the last Impala convertible, the following year moving to the top-of-the-line Caprice Classic. The Impala ragtop sold 6,456 units, placing fourth with just under 9% of the market, right behind the Corvette 6,508, ahead of the Mustang's 6,401.Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1960‚Äì1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p. 865. Total Impala production for 1972 ended up at 597,500 units and other series totals included Caprice, 178,500; Biscayne (in its final year), 20,500; Bel Air, 41,900; and station wagons, 171,700.3rd Edition Standard Catalog of American Cars: 1946-75, pg. 171 The 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine was offered in Impala four-door sedans and sport coupes along with a three-speed manual transmission and manual steering at the very beginning of the model year with 1,500 Impala sixes built. After the short run of early-1972 six- cylinder Impalas were built in the fall of 1971, the six-cylinder engine and three-speed manual transmission were relegated to low-line Biscayne and Bel Air sedans. For most the 1972 model year, all Impalas were V-8 powered and came standard with Turbo Hydramatic transmission, power steering and power front disc brakes. The standard Impala engine was now the 165-net 350-cubic- inch Turbo Fire V8 with optional engines including the 170-horsepower, 400-cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 (the base Caprice/Kingswood Estate engine), 240-horsepower, 400-cubic-inch Turbo Jet V-8 (rated at 215 horsepower on station wagons) or the 270-horsepower, 454-cubic-inch Turbo Jet V-8 ‚Äì these were the engine offerings in 49 states; in California the only engines offered were the 165-horsepower 350 and 170-horsepower 400 Turbo Fire small-block V8s due to that state's much stricter emission regulations. The Astro Ventilation system was redesigned for 1972 with the vents relocated from the trunk lid to the doorjambs for improved reliability and efficiency over the troublesome 1971 system that was a major source of complaints from owners to Chevrolet and its dealers. =1973= 1973 Impala Custom Coupe 1973 Impalas featured a larger, shock-absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required impact protection. The chassis was tweaked for better roadability, and new square taillights were mounted in the carry-over rear bumper. With the convertible now moved to the top-line Caprice Classic series, (continuing through 1975) Impalas were now all closed body styles for the first time in the nameplate's history and the station wagon known as the Kingswood since 1969 rejoined the Impala series. A 145-horsepower 350 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 engine, Turbo Hydramatic transmission, variable ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were standard on all Impalas. Optional engines in all models included a 175-horsepower 350 Turbo Fire V8 with four-barrel carburetor and 245-horsepower 454 Turbo Jet V8; while the Impala Custom coupe, Sport Sedan and station wagons could be ordered with the 165-horsepower 400 Turbo Fire V8 that was standard on that year's Caprice Classic series. All engines were offered nationwide in 1973. =1974= For 1974, the rear bumper of Impalas and other full-sized Chevrolets incorporated shock absorbing cylinders to meet the upgraded bumper standards with new taillights above the bumper, separated by the license plate and fuel filler. The front end featured a new grille and headlight bezels, a new header panel, and a bumper with a drop down center section. The marker lights moved back up beside the headlamps. 1974 Impala Sport Coupe Spirit of America Limited edition A limited-edition Spirit of America package was offered in 1974 on Sport Coupe models; primarily an appearance package, it featured white body paint, a white full vinyl top, white upholstery with red or blue trim, color-keyed seat belts and floormats, special wheel covers, optional white rally wheels, sports-styled dual remote outside rear view mirrors, a vinyl body side molding insert, and red pin- striping. Special fender and dashboard badges announced the package to passers-by and passengers. This was the only year of the 1971‚Äì1976 models the Impala had a different front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous year Caprice front to distinguish the two. The rooflines of the Impala coupes were revised. For 1974 the Custom Coupe was no longer a hardtop, with large fixed rear quarter glass and a thick B-pillar. The Sport Coupe, still a pillar-less hardtop, now used larger roll-down quarter glass like that of the 1971-73 Custom Coupe, and had a narrower, fastback style, flat back window similar to the 1966-68 Caprice coupes. The four-door sedan, four-door hardtop Sports Sedan and station wagons used carryover rooflines from 1973. Engine offerings included the standard 145-horsepower 350 Turbo Jet V-8 on sedans and coupes, optional 150- and 180-horsepower 400 Turbo Fire V8s (the latter standard on Impala wagons), and 235-horsepower 454 Turbo Jet V8. In California, a 155-horsepower 350 V-8 with four-barrel carburetor was standard and the only engine options there were the 180-horsepower 400 and 454 V-8s. =1975= The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice model carried a new front end with a swept back style header panel with recessed headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the radio and climate control graphics. Speedometers read up to , and added kilometers per hour. 1975 officially debuted a high-energy (HEI) electronic ignition system. Catalytic converters were also introduced as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package, intermittent wipers, and a divided 50-50 bench seat (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim). A Landau appearance package was new for 1975. It featured an elk-grained landau vinyl roof (with a chrome band across the roof), a choice of special paint colors, sports-styled dual remote outside rearview mirrors, color-keyed wheel covers, a vinyl bodyside molding insert, and pin-striping. Inside were color-keyed seat belts and floormats; fender and dashboard emblems rounded out the package. (An identical trim package was also sold on the Caprice model.) Sport Coupe models were discontinued after the 1975 model year, leaving the redesigned Custom Coupe, with its wide \\"B\\" pillar and fixed rear window, the only 2-door Impala available in 1976. Engine offerings were similar to 1974 except that the 400 Turbo Fire V-8 was now only offered in four-barrel 180-horsepower form and the 454 Turbo Jet V-8 was no longer offered in California. =1976= 1976 Impala 4-door sedan The 1976 Impala used a previous year Caprice nose, with a new \\"egg crate\\" grille insert. The Impala had round headlamps while the Caprice used the new quad rectangular ones. Engine offerings were the same as 1975 in both 49-state and California offerings. This was the final year for the four-door hardtop sedan, the big block 454 V-8 now yielding 225 horsepower, and the station wagon clamshell tailgate. The pillarless Impala Sport Coupe faded out of the lineup; a formal- roof Custom Coupe was the only Impala two-door. After 1976, the four-door hardtop body style also would disappear. Measuring more than 222 inches overall on a 121.5-inch wheelbase, the Impala ranked as the last of truly big Chevys. Full-size cars made the most of their perimeter frame and full coil spring suspension to deliver a smooth ride. The interior had such luxuries as simulated rosewood vinyl trim on the instrument panel, steering wheel, and doors. Impalas rode steel-belted radial tires and carried an automatic transmission, power brakes, and variable-ratio power steering. The standard bench seat could be replaced by a 50/50 split front seat, as in 1975. The Landau model, for both Caprice and Impala, continued into 1976 as before. A lighted visor vanity mirror was new to the options list. A lower-priced Impala \\"S\\" series, available only as a four-door sedan, was introduced this year for the United States market and functioned as a replacement for the Bel Air, which was dropped after the 1975 model year. The trim and standard features were similar to that of the departed Bel Air series (although this model used the same triple rear taillights as the regular Impala, unlike the twin- taillight setup of the Bel Air). The Impala \\"S\\" was sold primarily to fleet and government customers where luxury was not a concern, although the car was available for purchase by private customers who sought basic low-cost transportation with the convenience of a V-8 powered full-size automobile.

There was one intermediate station, . The line opened in 1855 and was worked by the GNR, but the H&KJR; company remained as an independent entity until 1923. The short line suffered from road competition after that time, and the passenger service was withdrawn in 1954, although a goods service was retained until 1971. There is now no railway activity on the former line.Atterbury, Paul, 2006, Branch Line Britain: A Nostalgic Journey Celebrating a Golden Age, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, page 144 Origins The Horncastle branch after opening of the Coningsby line In the first decades of the nineteenth century Horncastle had become an important centre for the buying and selling of horses, and it was a centre for agriculture in the district; its population in 1851 was 25,089.Horncastle Poor Law Union, from the 1851 census. The Wikipedia page Horncastle, Lincolnshire gives 5,017 for the civil parish. Squires gives 280 on page 83. At the same time Woodhall Spa had developed as a location where people went to take the cure; the spring waters, containing iodine and bromine, had been found by Thomas Hotchkiss to have curative properties, especially for gout.Ludlam, A J, Branch Lines of Lincolnshire: volume 2, Woodhall Junction to Horncastle, Lincolnshire Wolds Railway Society, 2015, Local people saw that a railway connection was a means to developing Horncastle; between 1845 and 1847 there were six unsuccessful attempts to promote a railway connection to the town. The Great Northern Railway operated the nearby main line at Kirkstead, opened in 1848.Anderson, Paul, Railways of Lincolnshire, Irwell Press, Oldham, 1992, In 1851 the GNR built a canal wharf at Dogdyke, enabling to serve Horncastle using the canal as a branch. On 27 September 1853 a meeting was held at the Bull Inn, Horncastle, \\"for the purpose of taking into consideration the propriety of establishing a line of railway between Horncastle and Kirkstead station on the Great Northern loop line.\\" The meeting resolved that \\"the formation of a branch railway from the Kirkstead station to Horncastle would greatly promote the commercial and agricultural interests of the town and neighbourhood.\\" A sub-committee was appointed \\"to confer with the Great Northern Company as to working of the proposed branch railway that company.\\" This resulted in the GNR agreeing to work the line for 50% of receipts.A J Ludlam, The Horncastle and Woodhall Junction Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1986, The Stamford Mercury reported that \\"the meeting passed off vary amicably, with the slight exception of some very irrelevant observations made by Mr. Brailsford, of Toft Grange, respecting compensation to the Navigation Company. Stamford Mercury, 30 September 1853 The Horncastle Canal evidently saw the promotion of a railway as inimical to its interests, and the canal company pressed its opposition in the Parliamentary hearings for the line. In addition, opinion formers in Horncastle were concerned that local people would purchase goods in Boston or Lincoln by travelling there by train, rather than supporting local businesses. Nevertheless the Horncastle and Kirkstead Junction Railway was authorised by Parliament on 10 July 1854; share capital was ¬£48,000, with borrowing powers of ¬£13,000.Awdry states (page 137) that it was incorporated as the Horncastle and Kirkstead Railway, but \\"took its new title\\" (implying \\"Horncastle Railway\\") on 10 July 1854. This seems to be a mistake, based on informal usage of the shorter form by contemporary newspapers. Conversely in a later formal report on authorised railways, the Times newspaper of 2 January 1855 used the full name. The local company built the line, using the contractor Thomas Brassey; Brassey had taken ¬£15,000 in shares on the understanding that he would be appointed as the contractor. The 1854 - 1855 winter was exceptionally severe, and work did not start until March 1855. An intermediate station was to have been made at Roughton but this was not proceeded with and the only intermediate station was Woodhall Spa.Stennett, Alan, Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Countryside Books, Newbury, 2007, The line was inspected for Board of Trade approval for opening by Lt-Colonel Wynne on 6 August 1855. However he reported that \\"I found the permanent way, generally, in a very incomplete state, and the rails especially so much out of adjustment, that I am of the opinion that the Horncastle Railway cannot be opened without danger to the public using the same\\".Correspondence in Report to the Lords of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade and Foreign Relations for the Year 1855, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1856 The Lincolnshire Chronicle reported that \\"Arrangements were made for running special trains ... during the day. This part of the proceedings was... obliged to be abandoned, in consequence of the government inspector (Col. Wynne), who passed over the line on Monday last, having declined to certify the line as fit for passenger-traffic. The late heavy rains having caused the soil to settle unequally in various parts of the line, is reported to be the cause of the withholding of the certificate; but, as this is mere temporary derangement, which a few days' labour will suffice to remedy, the opening of the line for regular traffic will not be long deferred.\\"Lincolnshire Chronicle, 10 August 1855 The line could not therefore be opened for passenger purposes, and it was opened for \\"light goods\\" only on 11 August 1855. An opening ceremony for the line had been arranged for that day, and it went ahead anyway, despite the refusal for passenger operation.Stennett, Alan, Lincolnshire Railways, Crowood Press, Marlborough, 2016, Rectification work must have been accomplished swiftly, for on 11 August 1855 Lt-Colonel Yolland inspected the line and found it satisfactory.Ludlam says in the Oakwood Press version that Wynne also made the second inspection. Opening The line opened fully on 26 September 1855. The directors had negotiated with the Great Northern Railway to work their line; the GNR operated the adjacent main line, between Lincoln and Boston. The new branch was miles in length from a junction at Kirkstead, on the main line. The junction at Kirkstead faced away from Kirkstead station, towards Boston, so branch trains had to reverse direction at the junction. Stations on the branch were Woodhall Spa and Horncastle.Squires, Stewart E, 1988, The Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Castlemead Publications, Ware, Carter E F, 1959, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London The reference to light goods probably refers to packages that could be manhandled on the passenger platform, prior to commissioning of the goods shed and cranage facilities; the line opened fully for the latter traffic on 26 September 1855.Chairman's statement at Shareholders' Meeting on 20 March 1856, reported in The Times newspaper, 24 March 1856 The total earnings for the part year from 8 August to the end of 1855, were ¬£1,537. Part that sum was payable to the Great Northern Railway for working the line and for use of Kirkstead GNR station; ¬£952 was the Horncastle and Kirkstead Railway's portion. A dividend of 3s ld. per share, stated to be \\"equivalent to 4% per annum upon the share capital of the company (less income-tax), leaving a balance of 331. 16s. 7d. for the next account.\\" Woodhall Spa The line was originally operated under the \\"one engine in steam\\" system, but from 3 June 1889 a block post was instituted at Woodhall Spa together with a crossing loop, and block working was operated.Mitchell, Vic and Smith, Keith, Boston to Lincoln, also from Louth to Horncastle, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2015, Train services For some years Woodhall Spa had no goods facility; a siding for the purpose was provided from 4 April 1887. In 1887 the passenger train service consisted of eight trains each way daily; the journey time was 28 minutes; there were additional trains on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and from 1898 one train conveyed a through coach from London. There was a Sunday service at first, but this was discontinued in June 1868. In 1910 the basic train service was six journeys each way with additional market-day services, but by 1938 it had risen again to eight with an additional service on Saturdays. The Autumn Horncastle horse fairs were renowned for the quality of the animals being sold, and the railway provided the means for local horses to be brought in, and despatched to their new owners at destinations countrywide. The late 1800s were the peak years and up to 150 horses arrived at the station every day for several days before. However the trade declined after 1918 as the use of mechanical transport increased. Nevertheless, Horncastle never developed industrially.Anderson, P H, The East Midlands: Regional Railway Handbooks, no 1, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1986, Finances 1890 In 1890 the Board of Trade pressed the proprietors of the railway to improve it in certain respects. The directors considered that this might be the opportune time to sell the line to the Great Northern Railway. They offered to do so on the basis of ¬£10 H&KJR; shares being exchanged for ¬£18 face value of GNR shares. The GNR considered this too high a price, but assisted the H&KJR; in obtaining a loan for the necessary work. After 1900 Kirkstead was renamed Woodhall Junction on 10 July 1922. After World War I the branch passenger trains were operated by a two coach set that had been converted from GNR steam railmotors nos 5 and 6. These vehicles were used until the end of passenger services on the line. (They were subsequently retained in service elsewhere, until 1959.) The Horncastle Railway Company continued in existence until the grouping of the railways in 1923, following the Railways Act 1922; the company had never operated its own trains and was simply a financial entity. Ownership of the line passed to the London and North Eastern Railway. It had \\"rarely\\" paid less than 6% in dividend. Due to the outbreak of hostilities, the line was closed to passenger operation on 11 September 1939, but the service was reinstated from 4 December 1939.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 In 1948 nationalisation of the railways took place, and British Railways took control. For some years the passenger carryings on the line were declining, and the passenger service was discontinued from 13 September 1954,Railway Magazine, October 1954, page 727 following the increase of road bus competition. One goods train ran daily on the line until closure on 5 April 1971, although Woodhall Spa's goods siding had closed on 27 April 1964. For six months prior to final closure, after the passenger services on the line from Lincoln to Coningsby stopped, Horncastle goods trains were the only users of the former Loop Line between Bardney and Woodhall Junction. The solum of the line from Horncastle to Woodhall Spa was later acquired by Lincolnshire County Council and is now part of the Viking Way and Spa Trail long distance footpaths.Woodhall Spa Community Website at http://www.woodhallspa.org/wp/31-2/heritage/railways See also Lincolnshire lines of the Great Northern Railway Notes References External links *Horncastle station and line history *Line history on the Woodhall Spa Community Website Category:Closed railway lines in the East of England Category:Rail transport in Lincolnshire Category:London and North Eastern Railway constituents ","title":"Horncastle Railway"},{"id":"28308131","text":"BlackSpider Technologies Limited was a British software company founded in 2002 and subsequently acquired by SurfControl in July 2006.

Career Coryton was appointed Vice-Warden of the Stannaries in 1603 and High Sheriff of Cornwall for 1613. In 1624 he was elected Member of Parliament for Cornwall. He was elected MP for Liskeard in 1625 and again MP for Cornwall in 1626. In 1620 he was appointed vice-warden of the Stannaries. In July 1627 Coryton was arrested for refusing to subscribe the forced loan of that year, and imprisoned in the Fleet Prison, where he remained until March 1628. His place of Vice-Warden of the Stannaries was in the meantime given to John Mohun. In view of the opening of parliament in 1628, he was released and was re-elected MP for Cornwall. He spoke in the debate on religious grievances on 27 January 1629, in that on tonnage and poundage which followed, and in other debates. His tone was described as \\"studiously moderate.\\" Coryton was present on 2 March 1629 when the Speaker, Sir John Finch, was forcibly held in his seat. After his fellow MP Sir John Eliot had read a remonstrance on tonnage and poundage, the Speaker had refused to put it to the house, and had risen to dissolve the assembly. Finch was then held in his seat by Denzil Holles and Benjamin Valentine while resolutions against Arminianism and illegal exactions were read and declared carried. Coryton was subsequently charged with having aided and abetted Eliot, Holles, and the rest, and even with having assaulted Francis Winterton, member for Dunwich, Suffolk. He was summoned with the other \\"conspirators\\" before the Star Chamber, and appeared, but refused to plead on the ground of privilege of parliament. He was accordingly committed a close prisoner to the Tower of London. An application for a habeas corpus made on his behalf in the following May was refused. He made submission, however, was released, and reinstated in his office in the Stannary Courts at some date prior to 16 January 1630. His administration of justice in the Stannary Courts gave much dissatisfaction to suitors, and in or about 1637 he was arrested on a charge of false imprisonment. The matter, however, was not pressed, and on his release he resumed his judicial duties. In April 1640 Coryton was elected MP for Grampound for the Short Parliament in an apparent double return, and was re- elected MP for Grampound for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He was at the time Mayor of Bossiney and was found guilty on petition of falsifying the returns for the election at the Parliamentary constituency of the same name. He was also found guilty of maladministration in the Stannary Courts and was \\"not admitted to sit\\" in Parliament. At the same time he was removed from the office of Vice-Warden of the Stannaries, and also from the Stewardship of the Duchy of Cornwall and Deputy-Lieutenancy of the County of Cornwall which he then held.

History  The congregation of the Caritas Sisters of Jesus was founded by Italian priests belonging to the Salesians of Don Bosco in 1937 in Miyazaki, Japan. The founder, Fr. Antonio Cavoli, SDB named the congregation \\"Caritas\\" because it started with the love and concern for the poor people. The love and self- sacrificing work of the Caritas sisters for the abandoned won the hearts of many non-Catholics and led them to God, and helped spread the Caritas sisters missionary presence in 11 countries with around 500 Japanese sisters and 500 Koreans. It was in 1992 that the first work offered to them was to set up a school in response to the growing needs of the new community in Laguna Technopark (Philippines). The Salesian community offered them the parcel of land situated at the junction of Sta. Rosa and Bi√±an, Laguna. Since the donated land was still bare, the homeowners of Sta. Rosa Village, a village within the vicinity, offered their Multi-Purpose Hall to be the temporary learning site. As a result, a co-educational school was established in 1994. CDBS had a humble beginning consisting of 21 pre-schoolers and three Caritas sisters together with two lay teachers.

It has homosexual content. Synopsis A man sporting a red jacket seeks shelter at the gas station where he works. He is an anonymous serial rapist known as \\"Crimson\\" and is fleeing a vigilante group which has been pursuing him. \\"Crimson\\" and the younger gas station attendant later leave together and attack and rape a young ballerina. The incident has a life-altering effect on the younger man, who has now become addicted to rape. He also goes on a raping spree, and is joined with \\"Crimson\\" for further attacks. Together the men rape waitresses in an abandoned movie theater. Due to the inability of the police to catch the criminals, vigilante groups have been pursuing \\"Crimson\\". Eventually the duo are tracked down, captured, and taken to an empty swimming pool by a homosexual gang. There the gang sodomizes \\"Crimson\\", bashes out his teeth with a hammer, and forces him to perform fellatio on them. Background Nikkatsu had started its SM line of Roman porno films in 1974 with the hits Flower and Snake and Wife to Be Sacrificed both featuring actress Naomi Tani and directed by Masaru Konuma.Weisser, pp. 51-52. After this first highly successful venture into sexual violence, the studio's output became increasingly rougher. According to director Yasuharu Hasebe, by 1976 the studio was looking for a new direction, and contacted him to develop films in a new style to be called \\"Violent Pink\\".Hasebe, Yasuharu. (1998). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser in Tokyo, 1999, in Asian Cult Cinema, #25, 4th Quarter, 1999, p.39. These would be comparable to the U.S. \\"roughies\\" film genre,Weisser, pp. 53, 326. violent and misogynistic, but without the whips, bondage and other traditional accoutrements of the S&M; genre.Weisser, p. 53. Hasebe had worked with the studio in the 1960s during their \\"Nikkatsu Action\\" era, but was not comfortable with the pink film genre to which the studio had turned with the inception of the Roman porno series in 1971.Weisser, p.368. Reluctant to work in the sex film genre, Hasebe later recalled warning the studio, \\"Are you sure you want me?... You must be aware-- my craft is very bloody.\\" Nikkatsu hired Hasebe, though, realizing that he might push the envelope of acceptability, the studio assigned producer Ry≈çji It≈ç to watch over him. Hasebe had known It≈ç from his days with Nikkatsu in the 1960s, and they had worked well together.Hasebe, pp. 39-40. It≈ç had been Hasebe's assistant director on the Alleycat Rock series.Hasebe, p. 40. In 1976 Hasebe turned out the first two \\"Violent Pink\\" films, Rape! and Assault! Jack the Ripper. Due to the box-office success of these films, Nikkatsu assigned him more work in the genre. The third in Hasebe's \\"Violent Pink\\" films, Rape! 13th Hour has a reputation as the most extreme of the series.Weisser, p. 327. Nervous about the film's graphic violence, Nikkatsu re-edited it before giving it a theatrical release. Nevertheless, the Weissers write that the released version is \\"graphically disturbing\\", \\"incredibly savage\\",Weisser, p. 52. \\"offensively appalling\\", and that it was \\"long-considered the most offensive, the most grotesque movie of all time.\\" Hasebe later recalled with amusement that the studio had made a mistake in assigning producer It≈ç to watch over him, as this most extreme of their trio of \\"Violent Pink\\" films was It≈ç's favorite. In spite of the film's box-office success, it became highly controversial with the public and with critics.Weisser, p. 328. The controversy surrounding the film was similar to that in the U.S. following the release of I Spit on Your Grave a year later in 1978. Because of the outcry over the film, Nikkatsu ordered that the extreme violence in future \\"Violent Pink\\" films be curtailed. Two years later, the successful release of K≈çy≈´ Ohara's Zoom Up: Rape Site, late in 1979, returned the genre to Hasebe's original \\"ultra-violent\\" vision.Weisser, pp. 53, 326, 525-526. Critical appraisal In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser give Rape! 13th Hour a rating of three-and-a-half out of four stars. They write that the film has allegorical meaning beyond the gratuitous on-screen violence. The film is said by some Japanese critics to be a commentary on the state of filmmaking in Japan at the time of its release. The brutalization of women in an abandoned movie theater, for example, is interpreted symbolically. Ruriko, the ballerina who is assaulted by the two men in the film is said to have been named after the actress Ruriko Asaoka, one of Nikkatsu's stars during the pre-Roman porno \\"Nikkatsu action\\" period of the 1960s, and known at the time of the film's release as Tora-san's love- interest Lily in the popular Otoko wa Tsurai yo series. Over twenty years after the first release of the film, Japanese critics held the film in high regard, with Kinema Jumpo placing it on their 1999 list of the 200 best Japanese films of the 20th century. Some Japanese critics, however, found the film to be simply an exercise in cinematic sadism, and dismissed any claims of a message behind the mayhem. Allmovie similarly notes of the film, \\"any point which Rape! 25-ji Bokan may have is lost in the barrage of sickening violence\\". Director Hasebe denied any intention of allegory on his part, claiming that he did not use cinema in this way. He suggested that if such messages were in the film they had come from screenwriter Chiho Katsura and producer Ry≈çji It≈ç. Jasper Sharp also gives the film a negative appraisal, calling it the poorest of Hasebe's films that he discusses in his Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema. He dismisses the film as a \\"preposterous red-blooded macho fantasy\\" which is little more than a series of attacks on women, and writes, that the final scene in which the two rapists are attacked by the vigilante gang, \\"almost seems like an apology for the onscreen outrages committed in the name of entertainment\\". Sharp describes the film as a kind of \\"buddy movie\\" made for men who claim to be attracted by women, but are more comfortable with other men. According to Sharp, the film trivializes the psychological effects of violence on women to a ludicrous degree, showing the victims enjoying the attacks to the point where one actually gives her attacker money, and asks him to return. 10kbullets.com also judges this aspect of the film‚Äîin which the victims come to enjoy their assaults‚Äîto be quite disturbing. Set pieces which stand out, according to Sharp include car chases, fistfights, and the ballerina's rape, set to the music of Swan Lake, with pillow feathers flying around the nude woman as if they were snowflakes. Availability Rape! 13th Hour was released theatrically in Japan on January 22, 1977. The film had not been released on video at the time of Yasuharu Hasebe's 1999 interview with Asian Cult Cinema. The director stated that it might be the film's controversial nature which caused the studio to hold back its release. Once released on videotape, it became a popular item. It was released on DVD in Japan on September 21, 2007, as part of Geneon's ninth wave of Nikkatsu Roman porno series. This release employed a new master struck from the original negative, with scratches and flaws corrected. Extras included the original theatrical trailer and a four- page booklet.

Hopes of success were high due to the emergence of local youngsters Chris Waddle, Peter Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne. Waddle and Beardsley had progressed into potential world class forwards under the management of Cox during the promotion campaign of the previous season, Waddle would win international recognition during the season before being sold to Spurs. Newcastle were now without the inspirational former England striker Kevin Keegan, who had retired from playing after the end of the promotion campaign. After a great start the team slowly drifted down the table, trying to offset this Charlton brought in tall centre forwards George Reilly and Tony Cunningham and changed to a long ball style.

According to the organization's official mission statement, IMCOM G9 delivers \\"quality Family and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs and services supporting the readiness and resilience of the All-Volunteer Army.\\" According to U.S. Army Regulation 215-1, Army MWR is a quality-of-life program that directly supports readiness by providing a variety of community, soldier, and family support programs, activities and services. Included in MWR are social, fitness, recreational, educational, and other programs and activities that enhance community life, foster soldier and unit readiness, promote mental and physical fitness, and generally provide a working and living environment that attracts and retains quality for U.S. Army soldiers, family members, retirees and its civilian workforce. The range of MWR programs offered at Army garrisons is based on the needs of authorized patrons who work and reside there. Programs are managed by garrison commanders within the framework of authorized and available appropriated and non-appropriated funds. Non- appropriated funds are those funds that are locally generated by MWR programs or provided by Installation Management Command (IMCOM) region directors and/or the Family and MWR Programs. AAFES dividends are also a source of non- appropriated funding. Each MWR program is classified by category. Categories are determined by their effect on the military mission and their ability to generate revenue. Objectives Family and MWR supports combat readiness and effectiveness; supports recruitment and retention of quality personnel; provides leisure time activities, which support a quality of life commensurate with generally accepted American values; promotes and maintains the mental and physical wellbeing of authorized personnel; fosters community pride, soldier morale, and family wellness and promotes unit esprit de corps, eases the impact of unique aspects of military life, such as frequent relocations and deployment.

Although the United States Army was founded in 1775,United States Army Center of Military History, The Birthday of the U.S. Army Morale, welfare, and recreation programs did not exist for the Army until the start of the twentieth century. Before that time, troop support came informally in the form of tradesmen and trading posts. The goods they were able to provide included meals, clothing, and laundering. The formalization of MWR services began with limited Congressional oversight established in 1876 over \\"Post Traders\\" and then the establishment of Army \\"PX\\" or The Post Exchange, by Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) in 1895, with War Department General Order No. 46, 1895.Army and Air Force Exchange Service Official Website Profits from the Post Exchange were used to support recreational activities for the troops. In 1903, the United States Congress passed the 1903 Army Appropriations Act, which provided funds to build, operate and maintain PXs, libraries, schools, recreation centers, and gyms for the troops. A 1951 image from Hospital Library Ward Service. U.S. Army Photo. The Army Morale Division was established in 1918, followed by the Army Motion Picture Service in 1920 and the Library Service in 1923. In 1941, the Army Morale Division and these other organizations collectively became \\"Special Services.\\" By 1943, Special Services had grown to include all of Army Recreation Services, the Army Exchange (the precursor to the Army and Air Force Exchange [AAFES]), and the Army Soldier Show. Special Services soon established the first Armed Forces Recreation Center (AFRC) in Bavaria (FMWR currently manages five AFRCs) and, by 1950, Special Services was placed under the Army Adjutant General's Office during an Army reorganization. Services for families, rather than just troops, began to emerge in the mid to late 1960s. In 1965, Army Community Services was created, followed in 1968 by a Youth Activities Program and, in 1971, an Outdoor Recreation Program.

Executive summary The Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality Program (NAFI), is operated by the Army for Department of Defense agencies and MWR programs are established, maintained, and disestablished under sole authority of Army Regulation AR215-1. FMWR's major business partner, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, provides a dividend to Army FMWR based on two distinct agreements. In the first, the Army shares 50 percent of AAFES net income after depreciation with the Air Force based on the number of active duty Soldiers and Airmen in each service‚Äîcurrently the Army receives 30 percent and the Air Force 20 percent of AAFES generated dividend revenue. Through the Army Simplified Dividend, garrisons receive 100 percent of profits from \\"Class VI\\" or personal demand supply items (such as health and hygiene products, soaps and toothpaste, writing material, snack food, beverages, cigarettes, batteries, and alcohol), 80 percent of pay telephone revenue, and 0.4 percent of all local AAFES sales. The latter component is deducted from the Army share of total AAFES profits with the remainder going to the Army Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund. Revenues received from Army Lodging room charges are used solely to sustain and recapitalize the Lodging program and its facilities. Monies derived from user fees and sales, AAFES, and recreation and amusement machine operations are invested and earn interest to benefit Army FMWR operations. When combined, NAF represents 42 percent of all funding, allowing Army FMWR programs to continue to serve more than 3.9 million patrons. Most of this money goes to Army installations and is used to run FMWR operations, programs, and services. What is left is focused on Army-wide capital improvements and minor construction and capital purchases. Total Army Strong/Army Family Covenant Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. George W.

MG Robert M. Joyce FMWR School The Installation Management Academy is a full-fledged brick and mortar institution of professional learning and career development, featuring the Maj. Gen. Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR School. The school includes numerous subject matter experts in various areas of U.S. Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Activities. Nearly 100 courses are offered through online or classroom formats. Recently, 39 courses have received college credit recommendations from the American Council on Education (ACE) and graduates are increasingly transferring them to colleges and universities to receive college credits. Since its inception, employees have completed over 28,400 courses in various Family and MWR program areas.Family and MWR Academy Website Maj. Gen. Reuben Jones and Virginia \\"Ginny\\" Joyce unveil the plaque commemorating the newly named Maj. Gen. Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR Academy at a ceremony 27 May 2010.In May 2010 the Family and MWR Academy was renamed the MG Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR Academy in honor of the first Commander of the Community and Family Support Center. MG Joyce was instrumental in the founding of the Academy and the inspired vision of a professional and developed workforce. Following the transition from a headquarters in Alexandria, Va., to San Antonio, Texas, The Academy became the Maj. Gen. Robert M. Joyce Family and MWR School within the Installation Management Academy. On 7 April 1986 the Commanding General of Community and Family Support Center (CFSC) tasked Colonel Perkins, as Chief of Field Operations, to review training within MWR and its programs throughout the Army. The focus of the review was to identify the system's currently available training, specify its shortfalls, determine the optimum training program, and project the estimated resources necessary to fund an improved program. The ultimate qualifier to apply to the review was \\"What is best for the Army.\\"Family and MWR Academy ‚Äì About Us Upon completion of Colonel Perkins' task, a Master Training Concept was developed and approved, and the MWR Academy was launched. A graphical representation of the Master Training Concept was defined in terms of a pyramid. The Master Training Concept was designed to integrate all levels of training and all programs for training, and ensure availability of training to the workforce. The Master Training Concept is still applicable today. This plan, in conjunction with the Army Civilian Training, Education and Development System (ACTEDS) Plan for Career Field 51 (MWR) forms the basis of the Family and MWR Academy's curriculum. Together, these guidelines provide a structured, progressive, and sequential approach to Family and MWR employee development and training for entry-level through executive-management positions. The Family and MWR School is also an Authorized Provider (AP) of Continuing Education Units (CEUs) from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/ International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET). All Family and MWR-sponsored courses are reviewed for their compliance with ANSI/IACET standards and receive CEUs. Since the Academy's inception, over 28,400 family and MWR employees have been trained in various Family and MWR program areas and at various levels. Funding categories =Category A: Mission-sustaining programs= Considered essential to sustaining readiness, these programs generally enhance and promote the physical and mental well being of Soldiers. Programs in this category have little or no capacity for generating Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) income and are supported almost entirely with funds appropriated by the U.S. Congress (APF). =Category B: Community support programs= These programs are closely related, in terms of supporting the military mission, to those grouped in category A. They satisfy the basic physiological and psychological needs of Soldiers and their Families and provide, to the extent possible, the community support systems that make military garrisons temporary hometowns for a mobile military population. These support programs will receive substantial amounts of APF support, but differ from those programs in category A, in part because of their ability to generate NAF revenues. That ability to generate revenues is limited, however, and in no case may they be sustained without substantial APF support. =Category C: Revenue-generating programs= These programs have less impact on readiness. They offer desirable social and recreational opportunities. Programs in this category have the capability of generating enough income to cover most of their operating expenses, but they lack the ability to sustain themselves based purely on their business activity; consequently, they receive limited APF support. Chapter 5 addresses funding for category C MWR programs located at remote and isolated sites, funding for base closures, and funding as a result of special security conditions. Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFI) Every NAFI is legally constituted as an \\"instrumentality of the United States.\\" The term \\"NAFI\\" includes entities at the garrison level, also referred to as garrison MWR operating entities or simply entities (previously the installation MWR fund). Funds in NAFI/entity accounts are Government funds, and NAF property, including buildings, is Government property. However, NAFs are separate from APFs of the U.S. Treasury. They are not commingled with APFs and are managed separately, even when supporting a common program. Each NAFI/entity operates under the authority of the U.S. Government in accordance with applicable Federal laws and departmental regulations. Because NAFIs/entities operate under the authority of the Federal Government, they are entitled to the same sovereign privileges and immunities as the Federal Government accorded by Federal law. Applicable DOD directives and implementing Army regulations are binding on NAFIs. NAFI/entity programs and facilities are operated, maintained, and funded as part of the U.S. Army's personnel and readiness program.
