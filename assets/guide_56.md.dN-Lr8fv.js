Early career  Morot had taken on various artistic interests since he was around five years old. He drew creatures inspired by those from monster movies; sculpted casts of his friends Star Wars toys; experimented with plasticine, Styrofoam, and Vaseline to make masks; and was making home movies beginning at the age of twelve. Though originally wanting to get into the film business as a stunt actor, his childhood experiences and a reading of a Fangoria feature about The Thing (1982) is what changed his career path to becoming a visual effects artist. Morot tried to break in when he was seventeen by working as a prop assistant and storyboardinging for various films made in Quebec. He quickly grew dissatisfied with being on set and the lack of FX work available in the area. At the age of 20, he went to Los Angeles as part of a tour offered by his friend, Jacques. After showing his portfolio to various workers in the effects industry, including Tom Savini (a man he first knew about from reading Fangoria), he quickly garnered six job offers.

Initially entering politics as a result of a dispute with a developer over her residential neighborhood, Prince returned to school and earned a law degree. She was concerned about over-development, conservation, and city planning, and formally entered politics in 1972, moving from the planning commission to the city council and finally mayor. She also served on state agencies, chairing the regional commission of the state parks authority. Upon leaving office, she worked at a large law firm which focused in the area of civil defense before scaling back her career to work as a director of a senior citizens' facility. Early life Frances Kay Roush was born on October 24, 1937 in San Pedro, California. She attended the San Diego State University, receiving a bachelor's of arts degree in history and political science. While at university, she met her husband Harvey Prince, with whom she had three children and in 1968 they moved to Thousand Oaks. Career Prince entered politics soon after the family's move, after noting the developmental company William Lyon Homes breaking a promise to use some of its land for a park, with it instead being used for the construction of high-density housing. She was one of the residents who founded the homeowner's association for the neighborhood and was elected as its president. The association was active, with Prince fighting developers who failed to live up to their plans or violated their permits. In 1972, she was appointed to serve on the planning commission evaluating development issues at the city-wide level, looking at such things as balancing code violations with safety issues and public desire. She was one of the commissioners who worked on the development of the Thousand Oaks General Plan to ensure that adequate open space reserves were maintained. Prince served on the planning commission until 1975 and was elected to the City Council in 1976. Her concerns were about controlling over development and limiting growth to maintain lower taxes and housing prices, as well as preserving the semi-rural environment of the area. and In 1978, Prince founded and served as chair of Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency to protect area green spaces. She served two terms as mayor with her first term from 1978-1979 and her second from 1983-1984 the first woman elected to that office. She was active in plans to develop the city library, which opened in 1982 and to develop an arts center, and which was finally approved for development as the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza in 1990. During her tenure on the council, Prince returned to school and graduated as valedictorian of her class with Juris Doctor's degree from University of La Verne College of Law in 1980. She was also appointed to serve on the governor's state parks agency conservation commission. Serving on the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the regional board of the state agency, she began as an advisor 1980, became a full member in 1982, and served as the chair on the Conservancy's board of directors until 1984. At the end of her final term as mayor, she chose not to run again, and went to work for a large Los Angeles law firm specializing in civil defense work. In 1991, Prince resigned from the firm and went to work for Senior Concerns, a facility which focused on the needs of older citizens and functioned as a day center for people who had Alzheimer's disease. When the group was given a building to repurpose an apartment complex for their needs, she led the sometimes heated discussion with the City Council and was seen as a pivotal force in the final approval of the project in 1992. and Death and legacy She died on 6 February 2017 and is remembered for her skill as a public policy maker. The Los Angeles Times noted in an article in 1997, that between 1969 and 1984, \\"probably no one had more impact than Prince on the public life of Thousand Oaks\\".

Suppose that S is a monoid with the property that, for all s\\\\in S, there exist only finitely many ordered pairs (t,u)\\\\in S\\\\times S for which tu=s. Let R be a ring. Then the total algebra of S over R is the set R^S of all functions \\\\alpha:S\\\\to R with the addition law given by the (pointwise) operation: :(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)(s)=\\\\alpha(s)+\\\\beta(s) and with the multiplication law given by: :(\\\\alpha\\\\cdot\\\\beta)(s) = \\\\sum_{tu=s}\\\\alpha(t)\\\\beta(u). The sum on the right-hand side has finite support, and so is well-defined in R. These operations turn R^S into a ring. There is an embedding of R into R^S, given by the constant functions, which turns R^S into an R-algebra. An example is the ring of formal power series, where the monoid S is the natural numbers.

Early life Brian Gl√ºss was born in London on 23 August 1930, the son of Joseph Gl√ºss and Otilie (n√©e Tenenhaus). His father, known as \\"Mottle\\", was from Russia and his mother, known as \\"Tilly\\", was from Botosani in Romania. They were all Jewish. In 1940, the family suffered tragedy when their London home was hit by a German bomb killing Gl√ºss's grandmother Anna Tenenhaus nee Goldshlager and his brother, Michael. The family moved to Bedford and Gl√ºss was educated in the town at Bedford Modern School where he excelled. After National Service with the Royal Air Force, Gl√ºss went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, on a state scholarship, matriculating in 1949 and taking the Mathematical Tripos. On graduation he was made a Pembroke Foundation Scholar and he took the Diploma in Mathematical Statistics in 1953. Career On leaving Cambridge, Gl√ºss was made research assistant to Professor Maurice Kendall (later Sir Maurice Kendall), an esteemed statistician who was then at the London School of Economics. After the LSE he worked as an actuarial clerk at Prudential Assurance in London before leaving England for America in 1954 having been contracted to work on the Jury Project at the University of Chicago. At the end of his contract he went to Ottawa as an Assistant to the Senior Researcher in the Bureau of Statistics of the Canadian Government between 1956 and 1958. At the end of his tenure at Ottawa, he returned to Chicago and became a staff member at the Illinois Institute of Technology between 1958 and 1962 before studying for a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Berkeley University; he was awarded his PhD in 1965. After Berkeley, Gl√ºss moved to Santa Monica, California, where he worked for the RAND Corporation under Richard Bellman, an American applied mathematician and pioneer of dynamic programming, a subject on which Gl√ºss wrote 'a well received book'. Following his time at the RAND Corporation he was made a Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and, later, Emeritus Professor following his retirement in 1988. Work on survivor guilt and charitable causes Gl√ºss didn't speak about the tragic circumstances that had befallen his family until he was 25, but instead found consolation in the work of William Niederland, a New York psychoanalyst who had observed, examined and worked with 2,000 survivors of the Nazi concentration camps. Writing to his old school in 2006 about his own experience and his respect for Niederland, Gl√ºss commented: > To varying degrees, he [Niederland] found a bundle of common symptoms, which > he later termed survivor guilt. Then, in the 1950s, he went on to examine > peacetime survivors, in the US, who had lost loved ones to violent death in > peacetime, by murder, suicide, violent accident. Again, in varying degrees, > the same symptoms cropped up. Discovering Neiderland was the key to my final > recovery. Without him I‚Äôd still be in generalized grief. When I work with > survivors, I use his method Inspired by Niederland, Gl√ºss used his own experiences to help others in one- on-one work with other survivors. He engaged in voluntary work in retirement homes in Berkeley, California, and was a voluntary mentor for victims of grief. Personal life Whilst at Berkeley, Gl√ºss married Joan Marie Chodorow, a therapist. The marriage was difficult and ended in divorce but he was fond of his stepchild, Lori Kim Smallwood. A life already beset by tragedy, his stepdaughter was murdered in 1980 which led to Gl√ºss campaigning against handgun ownership; his writings influenced the San Francisco and Berkeley gun control ordinances of 1982. After that sad event and retirement, he devoted his life to charitable and political causes; the tragedies he'd faced ‚Äòdid not diminish his cheerfulness and optimism‚Äô. He died on Boxing Day 2013 in Berkeley. Selected works * An elementary introduction to dynamic programming; a state equation approach.

It is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean where it is of minor importance to commercial fisheries. Description Kyphosus elegans has an oval, laterally compressed body with a small head and a pointed snout, the forehead slopes steeply in front of the eyes. The mouth is small and when closed the maxilla are partially hidden beneath the preorbital bones. The teeth are very characteristic and form a single row in the front of both jaws, they are incisiform and have a rather lanceolate shape, resembling the head of a hockey stick, they have compressed roots and they are set horizontally, creating a striated plate within the oral cavity, There are teeth on the vomer too. The dorsal fin is continuous, the front part contains 10-11 spines which can be folded into a groove which is covered in scales, the rear part has 13 soft rays. with the first few rays being higher than the rest. The anal fin has 2-3 spines and 12 soft with the longest rays being at the front and these are half the length of the base of the anal fin. The caudal fin is forked. Much of the body is covered in small, thick,rough scales except for a patch between the eyes. The lateral line contains 61-69 scales, of which 52-57 have pores. The body may be silvery in colour or it can be bronze or brown, they may also show a mottled pattern of white spots over the body. The mottle pattern is more commonly seen in fish demonstrating territorial behaviour. The tail is dusky. This species has a maximum total length of , although a more common total length is . Distribution Kyphosus elegans is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California to Panama, it also occurs in the Galapagos, and other eastern Pacific islands. Habitat and biology Kyphosus elegans is a coastal fish, the adults are found on reef flats or on reefs, while the juveniles are often found in tidal pools. It sometimes forms mixed schools with Kyphosus analogus and also with Prionurus laticlavius, with which it also grazes. This species feeds mainly on attached algae and will occasionally east plankton and benthic invertebrates. An analysis of the somach contents of sampled specimens indicated that Sargassum is the main algae eaten. It is the host of several ectoparasites such as Caligus chamelensis, C. latigenitalis, C. mutabilis or C. serratus. Fisheries Kyphosus elegans is considered important for commercial fisheries in the Gulf of Montijo in Panama. Species description and taxonomy Kyphosus elegans was first formally described as Pimelepterus elegans in 1869 by Wilhelm Peters from a type purchased in Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa, western Mexico. In 1880 Henri √âmile Sauvage described a species of Kyphosus from Hawaii from specimens which had been sent to him by a French consul there and named it as Kyphosus sandvicensis but there appears to have been a mix up as his description does not match the type specimen lodged in the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris and recent workers have found that K. sandvicensis is a junior synonym of K. elegans, although Fishbase still treats it as a valid species, with a note that it is a synonym of K. elegans.

From 1688 to 1805, this rank was fifth in order of precedence; after 1805, it was the sixth. In 1864, it was abolished as a promotional rank (pictured opposite is the command flag for a Vice-Admiral of the White). History The Navy Royal inaugurated squadron colours during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) to subdivide the English fleet into three squadrons. There were three classes of admirals and differentiated by using coloured flags.. In 1620 the official Flag ranks of Admiral, Vice Admiral, and Rear Admiral were legally established that arose directly out of the organisation of the fleet into three parts. Admiral of the Fleet as an official flag rank was formally created in 1688. The Vice-Admiral of the White was a senior rank of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, immediately outranked by the rank Vice-Admiral of the Red (see order of precedence below). Such senior ranks or offices generally qualify the Royal Navy officers holding them to be considered admirals, a category that consists of the ranks of commodore, rear admiral, vice admiral and admiral of the fleet. From 1688 to 1805 the rank of Vice-Admiral of the White was fifth in the order of precedence; after 1805 it was the sixth. In 1864 it was abolished as a promotional rank. Order of precedence Admirals of the Colour The Navy was divided into three squadrons Red, White and Blue in order of seniority. Admirals were appointed to these squadrons and therefore their rank and squadron split the seniority originally into 9 bands then later 10 with ‚ÄòAdmiral of the Fleet' as senior to all others.. Seniority was therefore from 1805 to 1864: # Admiral of the Fleet # Admiral of the Red Squadron (rank created in 1805) # Admiral of the White Squadron # Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the White Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the White Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Blue Squadron Seniority was therefore from 1688 to 1805: # Admiral of the Fleet, (rank created in 1688) # Admiral of the White Squadron # Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the White Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the White Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Blue Squadron Admirals without an appointment were colloquially referred to as Yellow Admirals. Ships of the Royal Navy flew the Ensign that coincided with the squadron of their commanding officer.

They are united by having simpler genitalia than other araneomorph spiders, lacking a cribellum, and sharing an evolutionary history of synspermia ‚Äì a particular way in which spermatozoa are grouped together when transferred to the female. Synspermia Spermatozoa are produced in a multi-step process. A primary spermatocyte with the full diploid number of chromosomes divides to form two secondary spermatocytes which are haploid, i.e. each has half the diploid number of chromosomes. Each secondary spermatocyte then divides to produce two spermatids which undergo further development to form spermatozoa. In synspermia, two or more spermatids from the same spermatocyte fuse together and are enclosed in an envelope, forming a \\"capsule\\". This contrasts with cleistospermia, where the capsules enclose individual spermatozoa. After transfer to the female in either form, decapsulation and activation are necessary before the resulting spermatozoa can fertilize eggs. Phylogeny In 2014, Peter Michalik and Mart√≠n Ram√≠rez published a study of the morphology of the reproductive system of male spiders, including their spermatozoa. They found a clade within haplogyne spiders, Synspermatia, characterized by the absence of a cribellum and the synapomorphy (shared derived character) of synspermia. Not all members of the clade exhibit synspermia, since it has evolved into cleistospermia multiple times and Telemidae have individually encapsulated sperm cells arranged in densely packed stacks. A much larger molecular phylogenetic study published in 2016 also found Synspermatia to be a clade, grouping with the families Hypochilidae and Filistatidae at the base of Araneomorphae: Families Families placed in Synspermiata are: *Caponiidae *Diguetidae *Drymusidae *Dysderidae *Ochyroceratidae *Oonopidae *Orsolobidae *Pacullidae *Periegopidae *Pholcidae *Plectreuridae *Scytodidae *Segestriidae *Sicariidae *Telemidae *Tetrablemmidae *Trogloraptoridae (Telemidae was not included in the analysis by Wheeler et al., but is placed in Synspermiata in other studies.)

Design and development All the Redline 41 designs are small recreational keelboats, built predominantly of fiberglass and other composites. The earlier two designs were predominately built as cruising sailboats, whereas the most recent boat was conceived as a racer that can also be used for cruising. The original Redline 41, later called the Mark I, was designed by Cuthbertson & Cassian and produced by Bruckmann Manufacturing, although only two were built between 1967 and the following year. The second model, known as the Redline 41 Mark II, was also designed by Cuthbertson & Cassian and produced by Bruckmann Manufacturing starting in 1969, which became part of C&C; Yachts that same year. This version was similar to the earlier version, but used new molds and 35 examples were built. The boat remained in production until 1972, when sales declined and it was discontinued. Lindsay Plastics purchased the molds and produced the Newport 41 from them under the name of Capital Yachts. The Redline 41 name was resurrected in 2014 with a new design by Mark Mills based on his 2001 design, the King 40.

It was reported that these prisoners inside the said cell were being held by the police allegedly to be released only upon payment of ransom. Background On April 27, 2017, the Commission of Human Rights-NCR (CHR-NCR) team, led by Chief Gilbert Boiser, raid the Manila Police District station and discovered the so-called 'hidden jail', measuring five-feet wide, behind the bookshelf, which contained about 12 prisoners and it was poorly ventilated‚Äîexcept for an exhaust fan. CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia told the Philippine Star \\"that the commission confirmed that 12 people have been detained for at least 10 days without the filing of charges.\\" The officials insisted that they are still processing the detainees' arrest notifications and refused the requests of freeing the detainees by the CHR. As a result, MPD station commander Supt. Robert Domingo and other 12 officers were relieved temporarily from his post on April 28. Domingo denied the allegations and said the area \\"is only a ‚Äúholding room‚Äù of the station‚Äôs drug enforcement unit.\\" He also said that the 12 individuals were arrested during their operation on early morning of April 27 for possession of illegal drugs. President Rodrigo Duterte vowed to look into the secret jail, in his interview in Malaca√±ang on April 28, along with Philippine National Police chief Ronald \\"Bato\\" dela Rosa. The MPD jail cell was not the first such secret police detention cell discovered in the Philippines. In January 2014, Amnesty International reported the discovery of a secret torture cell in a police intelligence facility in Bi√±an, Laguna where officers allegedly routinely tortured 44 inmates for fun in a game of roulette. The Commission on Human Rights which raided the facility discovered the ‚Äòtorture roulette‚Äô table which had markings indicating the kind of torture to be used on the detainees. The detainees of the Bi√±an secret cell, most of which were arrested on drugs-related cases, complained of being physically abused to force them to give information. They also accused 10 police officers of extortion. Amnesty International called on the administration of then President Benigno Aquino III to put an end to routine torture in police facilities and for the errant personnel to not just be suspended, but also be held accountable in a court of law. Detainees Some detainees claimed that the police demanded between P30,000 to P100,000 from them in exchange of their release. Others claimed that they were being tortured. One of the detainees inside the secret jail, a woman, in an interview of DZMM-AM, said that one of the police demanded her a P50,000, in exchange of her release, after she is being accused of involvement in an illegal drug trade despite the lack of evidence against her. Reactions On April 28, international non-government organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the anti-drug campaign by Duterte amid the discovery of the secret jail at the MPD station 1. HRW also urged the Philippine government for immediately release of 12 detainees. National Capital Region police chief Director Oscar Albayalde stated that the hidden jail was \\"purposefully used as a staging area.\\" and the purpose of this was unclear. Dela Rosa criticizes the CHR for visiting the station and defended the police, stating that \\"as long as cops were not corrupt and abusive.\\" Albayalde thanked the CHR for \\"taking time to inspect the detention cells of our stations so that they're able to see the real condition of these facilities.\\" Senate minority leader Franklin Drilon urged the Philippine National Police (PNP) leadership to prosecute instead of defending the police officers behind the secret jail. On April 30, Senator Panfilo Lacson stated, in his Twitter account, that defending the secret jail is \\"incomprehensible\\" and \\"it is also very arrogant.\\" On May 2, Senator Bam Aquino sought for a Senate investigation into the secret jail cell. Aquino also criticized dela Rosa who defended the police officers over the jail cell, stating it encourages a ‚Äúculture of impunity.‚Äù References Category:2017 crimes in the Philippines Category:2017 scandals Category:Crime in Metro Manila Category:Law enforcement in Metro Manila Category:Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte Category:Philippine Drug War ","title":"Manila Police District secret jail cell scandal"},{"id":"53921220","text":"Rhodeus meridionalis is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish in the genus Rhodeus.

According to popular tradition, de San Antonio was able to read the mind of a convent servant, named Felipa, who prayed that God would lead her to purgatory after her death. The nun rebuked her, urging her to ask God to go to heaven instead of purgatory. Another miracle attributed to the nun happened when a mason who worked in the convent fell into the void, rushing to the ground gently and swaying, without dying or suffering damage, since the workman had entrusted to the nun.

She was born on 18 January 1901 into a Jewish family and died on 3 November 1978.  Studies and training  Margit Tevan was born on 18 January 1901 in B√©k√©scsaba (Hungary) into a Jewish family whose father was running an important editing house. She started her artistic studies at the Academy of Applied Arts in Budapest and after one year specialized with some of the most famous goldsmiths of the time: Richard Zutt and Ferenc (Francis) Kiss. Not being interested in making jewels, she later joined Arp√°d V√©rtes' workshop which was better known under the name of \\"St√∫di√≥\\" (1927-1928). In 1927 she married the chemical engineer Mikl√≥s Engel and moved to Budapest. By creating boxes and plates, she innovates the goldsmith tradition which at the time was more interested in making vases and bowls.  Influence and creations  The influence of the Bauhaus school is evident in her early work. She then continued her artistic development towards an archaic romanticism, influenced by Romanesque art and the simplicity of the motifs which she used, especially in her friezes which decorate her boxes and plates. Her many objects which she produced during her whole life are mainly hand hammered silver-leafed copper. One can find traces of references to both Jewish and Christian culture in her work. She continued her production during Communism where she kept her poetic register with smaller works that are sometimes offered as presents.  War and persecution  Between 1944 and 1945, she was forced to live in the international ghetto of Budapest and obtained a safe conduct passport from the Swedish authorities.  Acknowledgements and prizes  She participated in numerous exhibitions and received a Dipl√¥me d'honneur for her work during the Paris World Exhibition in 1937. She also obtained a similar diploma during the 1939 New York World Fair. Finally, she won the silver medal at the VII Milan Triennale of 1940. In 1957, she won the Munk√°csy Prize, the highest artistic recognition in Hungary, as well as numerous other prizes between 1971 and 1976. She died in Budapest on 3 November 1978.

Her life was involved in mysticism and controversy.Los 4 m√≠sticos tinerfe√±os (The 4 Tenerife mystics), https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2017/03/galeria-misticos-tinerfenos/ (in Spanish)  Career  The Holy Inquisition tried her as a witch. She was accused of practicing Molinist doctrines.Los conventos de La Orotava. Manuel Hern√°ndez Gonz√°lez. It was hinted that the relationship with her confessor was not appropriate for a religious person. Her biographer and confessor, Andr√©s de Abreu, burned the biography he had written about her.Alrededor de Fray de Abreu (1647-1725): Historiograf√≠a literaria y una obra in√©dita. However, Dominican friar Jose Herrera said that among her virtues was to give sight to the blind, to make the deaf hear, the mute to speak, heal the lame, heal diseases and expel demons. Sr. Maria Justa healed the sick by transferring to her person the evils and diseases that afflicted them. Shamanic priests in other cultures used analogous techniques to cure convalescents. That similarity fed the suspicions of those who called her an \\"alumbrada\\". During these healings, the nun suffered multiple ailments, covering her body in sores and elevating her body temperature, which brought her to the brink of death.  Death  Sister Maria Justa died in 1723. According to the chronicles of the time, her body showed signs of sanctity, such as flexibility, pleasant fragrances and fluidity of her blood. After her death, the Franciscan Order in the Canary Islands conducted a process of canonization that was later halted.  Alumbrados  Her case was ascribed to the phenomenon of the \\"Alumbrados\\" that arose in small Castilian towns two centuries earlier. These were people who professed doctrines considered heretical by the Catholic Church, believing that union with God came only through mystical experiences and private prayer, without the need for Church sacraments..

Analytical study of Alfred Hill‚Äôs String Quartet no. 2 in G minor (Thesis, Master of Arts). University of Otago in Sydney.Donald Maurice. Booklet notes to Naxos 8.570491 The first two quartets were published together by Breitkopf & H√§rtel in 1913 (no full score, only parts). Each of them used to be referred as Maori,E.g.: \\"the two sonorous Maori String quartets\\" (); \\"two Maori String quartets\\" () a feature that can lead to confusions. Today the first one is called Maori, while for the second another (longer) subtitle is retained.In notes to Naxos 8.570491 this quartet is called Maori. However, in Stiles's catalogue this title is reserved for the Second, while the First quartet lacks there any special name. Its approximate duration is 22 minutes.  History  Hill began composing this quartet while he was studying in Leipzig Conservatory (between 1887 and 1891), but the two middle movements (Adagio and Scherzo) were later (after 1896) substituted with new music incorporating MƒÅori ideas. The second theme of the Finale is actually the same MƒÅori tune that was used as a principal (love) theme in Hill's 1896 cantata Hinemoa (though its origin is not indicated in the quartet score). The 1896 as terminus post quem for this quartet is also based on the composition of Hinemoa: it was by its success that Hill became fond of incorporating MƒÅori tunes into his music. Even in its final form this quartet remains clearly European in style. The original Scherzo was used by Hill in his First Symphony (by 1898) and in the Fourth Quartet.  Structure  The Quartet is in four movements: :I. Moderato ‚Äî Allegro :II. Waiata (Songs accompanying the Dance). Haka Dance (Barbaric) ‚Äî Trio. Poi Dance (Graceful) ‚Äî Da capo :III. Tangi (Lament). Lento ‚Äî Con moto ‚Äî Tempo I ‚Äî Allegro :IV. Finale. Allegro moderato The first movement is a sonata form. Its first subject (in B-flat major) consists of two parts: a slow (Moderato) and a fast (Allegro), both played twice. They reappear in the development section and in the reprise. The second theme (Cantabile) is in F major. At the end of the movement it is repeated in B-flat major. Both the exposition and the reprise close with a new statement of the initial slow theme. The Waiata is a scherzo with a trio. Both themes are MƒÅori: a barbaric Haka Dance and a graceful Poi Dance. The main section is in F major, while the trio is in D major. The Tangi is also based on a MƒÅori. It is a sorrowful melody in G minor with a contrasting middle section in fast tempo (Con moto). This movement ends with a brief coda. Just like the opening movement, the Finale is laid out in a sonata form (in B-flat major) with a second subject first stated in F major. It is the longest movement of the quartet and its coda (Animato) provides a splendid conclusion for the whole piece.  Editions  * Alfred Hill. String Quartet No.1 in Bb.

Laid out in the 1860s, its residential character is in marked contrast to the commercial development that predominates around it. The street's buildings, constructed between the early 1860s and 1900, are a cross- section of Victorian architectural styles. The entire length of the street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history Charter Oak Place is located on the southern fringe of Hartford's downtown area. Its northern end is on Charter Oak Avenue between Main Street and Popieluszko Court, and its southern end is on Wyllys Avenue. It may be seen to continue as S. Prospect Street to the north and Groton Street to the south. It is a relatively narrow road, but is lined by trees and represents a quiet urban residential enclave in an otherwise more densely built area. The buildings which line the street are all residential, containing either one or two housing units. The majority of buildings are brick and 2-1/2 or 3 stories in height. Stylistically they are diverse, including examples of Italianate, Second Empire, Romanesque, and Queen Anne Victorian styles. Three of the houses at the southern end are wood frame structures. Some of the properties have a carriage house in the rear. The area that became Charter Oak Place was a country estate in the mid-19th century. Charter Oak Place was informally laid out about 1857, and development proceeded from the 1860s until about 1900. The urban density of the relatively high quality construction and upper class focus is somewhat unusual for Hartford, because most of the city's upper class were during the late 19th century moving to more suburban settings, in neighborhoods such as Clay-Arsenal north of the downtown. Charter Oak Place was populated by merchants, judges, and skilled craftsmen. One notable resident of the street was Richard Jordan Gatling, inventor of the Gatling gun.

Geography  = Location = The Napo moist forests ecoregion covers part of the Amazon basin to the east of the Andes in the north of Peru, the east of Ecuador and the south of Colombia. It has an area of . The ecoregion extends from the foothills of the Andes in the west almost to the city of Iquitos, Peru in the east, where the Napo and Solim√µes (Upper Amazon) rivers join. In the extreme northwest the Napo moist forests ecoregion transitions into Cordillera Oriental montane forests to the west. Otherwise it transitions into Eastern Cordillera Real montane forests in the west. To the south it transitions into Ucayali moist forests, and into a broad belt of Iquitos v√°rzea along the Mara√±√≥n / Solim√µes river. To the east it transitions into Solim√µes-Japur√° moist forests in the south and Caqueta moist forests in the north. The Napo moist forests contain areas of Iquitos v√°rzea along rivers in the south and areas of Purus v√°rzea along rivers in the north.. = Terrain = The terrain consists of floodplains and very low hills. To the west it is bounded by the foothills of the Andes. It slopes gently down from elevations of in the west to elevations of in the east. In the plains of the north the higher land rises no more than above river level. Soils include older material from the Guiana Shield mixed with Quaternary sediments washed down from the Andes. The Mara√±√≥n River defines the southern boundary of the ecoregion. The Cagu√°n River, a tributary of the Caquet√° River defines the eastern boundary in Colombia. The Napo River, a tributary of the Solim√µes, defines the eastern boundary in Peru. Other important Amazon basin rivers that cross the ecoregion include the Morona, Pastaza, Tigre and Curaray, and the headwaters of the Caquet√° and Putumayo. = Climate = The ecoregion has a humid tropical climate. Mean annual temperatures are . At different times of year, different elevations and different distances from the equator monthly temperatures may vary from . Annual rainfall in the furthest west of the ecoregion is up to , while in the east it is , still a very high level. There is a \\"dry\\" season with rather less rain than at other times of the year. At a sample location at the K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. At this location monthly mean temperatures range from in July to in November. Yearly total rainfall is about Monthly rainfall varies from in December to in May.  Ecology  Scene in the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm, in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. The Napo moist forests terrestrial ecoregion is part of the Napo Moist Forests global ecoregion of the northern Amazon basin, which also includes the Ucayali moist forests. The heavy but seasonal rainfall, diverse terrain and soil, and barriers formed by large rivers contribute to great diversity of flora and fauna. In the past the region has undergone large shifts in average temperature and humidity, with new species invading the region or evolving within the region. Large changes in river meanders in the Santa Cecilia region of the northwest of Ecuador may have created barriers that split species into population that then evolved independently. = Flora = In a area of the Napo moist forests over 310 species of trees have been counted. The Yasun√≠ Biosphere Reserve contains about 4,000 species of plants. 138 species of orchid have been reported below of elevation in Ecuador. = Fauna = white-banded swallow (Atticora fasciata) on the Tiputini River in Yasuni National Park common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) in the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve The Yasun√≠ Biosphere Reserve has at least 70 species of mammals. This includes 13 primate species including the silvery woolly monkey (Lagothrix poeppigii), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus),white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth) and monk saki (Pithecia monachus). Other mammals include the South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), jaguar (Panthera onca), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). The region is home to the spectral bat (Vampyrum spectrum), the largest bat in the New World. Endangered mammals include white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) and mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque). The Yasun√≠ Biosphere Reserve has more than 400 fish species. Endangered amphibians include Hemiphractus johnsoni (Johnson's horned treefrog), Hyloxalus cevallosi (Palanda rocket frog) and Pristimantis festae. The Yasun√≠ Biosphere Reserve has more than 500 species of birds. Endangered birds include wattled curassow (Crax globulosa).  Status  The World Wildlife Fund gives the ecoregion the status of \\"Critical/Endangered\\". Studies in the Yasun√≠ area of Napo Province, Ecuador, show that where roads within oil concessions are uncontrolled they are quickly used by colonists who deforest the area so they can grow crops and pasture for cattle. Where the roads are policed, colonization by non- indigenous people is avoided but species whose meat is sold for food are rapidly depleted in areas within walking distance of settlements. As the indigenous Huaorani people become more connected to markets, their farms are expected to increase in size and the pressure on wildlife to intensify.  Conservation  Protected areas include the Cayambe Coca Ecological Reserve and the Yasuni National Park. The Yasun√≠ landscape in Napo, Ecuador, combines the Yasun√≠ National Park and the surrounding Waorani Ethnic Reserve. It contains parts of the lower Napo and Yasun√≠ rivers. UNESCO designated the area the Yasun√≠ Biosphere Reserve in 1989. It protects the heart of one of Ecuador's last remaining areas of untouched, continuous tropical forest, a biodiversity hotspot that is one of the richest on the planet. It is also home to the uncontacted Tagaeri and Taromenane clans of the Huaorani people. Although a large part of the Yasun√≠ Biosphere Reserve is undisturbed, it is in an area where the rule of law is not enforced and where immigrant farmers are advancing along roads build by oil companies and clearing forest so they can grow crops and graze livestock.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The Chapel of Ease at Leytonstone, built in 1749 and rebuilt in 1819. Later used as the Leytonstone National School until 1876, it was finally demolished in 1938. =Chapel of ease= Leytonstone originally formed a part of the ancient parish of Leyton, for which the only Anglican place of worship was Leyton Parish Church. In 1748, some wealthy residents proposed that a chapel of ease should be built in Leytonstone, then a rural but prosperous village; one of them complained that \\"the inhabitants in general find it very inconvenient, and many utterly impossible, for them to resort thither [to Leyton] at least so frequently as they ought for ye public worship of God\\". Despite the opposition of the lord of the manor, David Gansel of Leyton Grange, and the ambivalence the vicar of Leyton, a plot of land was leased on the west side of Leytonstone High Road and a small chapel was built on it, funded by residents including the poet David Lewis and the banker Samuel Bosanquet. The chapel opened in 1749, but was closed soon afterwards when Gansel took legal action to prevent its use, until 1754 when a minister was appointed by the Bishop of London with a stipend provided by pew rents. In 1819 the chapel was enlarged, but because it was built on leasehold estate, it could not be consecrated, although the bishop agreed that it could be licensed for the administration of sacraments. The enlarged chapel, which stood opposite where Barclay Road now joins the High Road, was able to seat 580, with 240 seats being rent free for those unable to pay.Hammock 1904, pp. 58-59 Following the chapel's redundancy as a place of worship, the building was for used by the Leytonstone National Schools, which had previously been housed in buildings in the chapel grounds. The schools moved to purpose built premises in Kirkdale Road in 1876 and the chapel was used thereafter as assembly rooms until its demolition in 1938. =New church and parish= A print depicting the Church of St John the Baptist as it appeared in 1833. In July 1830, the vicar of Leyton preached a sermon in which he pointed out the deficiencies of the chapel at Leytonstone which included \\"the insecure and decaying condition of the edifice, the want of devotional character in its appearance, and the inadequate accommodation which it offers to the labouring classes\\". On 1 August, a committee was formed to raise money for a new church by subscription, ¬£1,000 having already been contributed by an elderly parishioner, probably the mariner and merchant Joseph Cotton. In December, the architect Edward Blore was engaged to draw up plans for a new church and in February 1831, the firm of Curtiss, Dean & Crow were invited to tender for the construction work. Meanwhile, a large plot of land further north along the High Road was purchased at the expense of William Cotton of Wallwood House, a successful merchant and the son of Joseph Cotton, which after much legal negotiation was transferred to the Church Commissioners on 16 June 1832.Hammock 1904, pp. 61-64 The first stone of the new church was laid on 20 July 1832 by the vicar of Leyton.Hammock 1904, p. 64 The design was in the Early English Gothic style, using yellow brick with stone dressing. The building originally consisted of a small sanctuary, a nave, and a pinnacled, three stage bell tower at the western end. There was seating for about 600 people, initially in box pews. The church was consecrated on 31 October 1833 by the Bishop of London, Charles James Blomfield. The churchyard was enclosed by brick walls and iron railings at the end of that year.Hammock 1904, pp. 65-67 A ring of bells was cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and donated by William Davis of The Pastures; all six are named after female members of the Davis and Cotton families.Hammock 1904, p. 76 The creation of a separate ecclesiastical parish for the church was announced in the London Gazette on 11 February 1845,Hammock 1904, p. 67 Reverend Hebert Evans being the first vicar.Hammock 1904, p. 85 The third vicar, Horace Waller, a prominent abolitionist, was appointed to St John's in 1870. He was friends with a number of missionaries to Africa, including David Livingstone. Some sources suggest that Livingstone visited Waller in Leytonstone, however Livingstone had left the United Kingdom for the last time in August 1865. Following Livingstone's death in 1873, Abdullah Susi and James Chuma, Livingstone's African companions, visited England and were invited by Waller to stay at the vicarage in Leytonstone (now the site of a Matalan store), and there they helped Waller to edit and annotate Livingstone's journals which were published late in 1874, shortly after Waller had moved to a new parish in Twywell, Northamptonshire. In the vicarage back garden, Susi and Chuma built a replica of the African hut in which Livingstone had died; a photograph of it survives at the School of Oriental and African Studies. =Additions and enlargements= The arrival of the railway at Leytonstone in 1856 caused social change in the district as the wealthy families sold their estates for streets of terraced houses, which in turn brought about a large increase in the population in the following decades.Hammock 1904, pp. 70-71 To cater for the increase in worshipers, a number of daughter churches were established in Leytonstone; Holy Trinity, Harrow Green in 1874, St Andrew, Forest Glade in 1882, St Margaret of Antioch, Woodhouse Road in 1884, St Catherine, Hainault Road in 1885 and St Columba, Ravenstone Road in 1888. Plans to enlarge St John the Baptist were finalised in 1890, but approval and funding were not in place until April 1893 when work commenced. The new additions included a chancel which could accommodate the choir, a choir vestry and a new seating arrangement allowing 140 new places.Hammock 1904, pp. 71-72 The architect for the work was the firm of Adams & Mann. A new pipe organ of three manuals and 34 stops was installed, built by Brindley & Foster of Sheffield. This replaced a barrel organ which could play a total of 66 hymn tunes and was operated by a local gardener, who was in the habit of cranking it faster than the congregation could sing.Hammock 1904, pp. 77-79 Also added at that time was a stone pulpit, originally designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield for St James's Church in Belgravia where it was found to be unsuitable.Hammock 1904, p. 75 The additions were consecrated by the Bishop of Colchester, Dr Alfred Blomfield, on 30 September 1893. An enlarged vestry for the clergy was completed in 1902.Hammock 1904, pp. 73-74 A road widening scheme caused the relocation of the churchyard walls in 1902, retaining the original railings, and on completion, a row of trees was planted to commemorate the Coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra.Hammock 1904, pp. 80-81 In 1909, work started on a new south aisle designed by W. D. Car√∂e and Herbert Passmore, which was completed in the following year and extended in 1928 to form a side chapel by C. E Kempe & Co. Car√∂e also added a flight of steps leading to the tower door. A prominent wheelchair ramp was added to the south in 2003, designed by Kay Pilsbury Architects. St John's Church was given Grade II listed building status on 24 February 1987. Present day St John's Church from Church Lane E11 in 2010. Reverend David Britton took up the post of vicar in July 2014. =Events= * The Stones Throw Market, where stallholders offer a mix of local designs including jewellery, pottery, glassware, vintage clothing and homemade cakes and tea. * Churchyard Market * Hitchcock outdoor film screenings in churchyard * Tower Tours, views across London to Canary Wharf, The Shard, Gherkin etc. from the top of St John The Baptist's church tower. * Repair Cafe, a Waltham Forest Council scheme, offering free repairs of bikes and electrical items. =Bell ringing= An active team of bell ringers at St John's ring for Sunday services and practice on Monday evenings. A notable former bell ringer was William Pye (1870-1935), who moved to Leytonstone in 1906 and was described by The Ringing World as \\"the greatest ringer of his time\\". Two treble bells were bought for St John's as a memorial to him, making a total ring of eight.

The first eight-part series, which also alludes to hints of the supernatural and horror genres, is based around a disused ski resort in the north of Sweden, and was written by Kvensler, Moa Herngren, Peter Arrhenius, and Jonathan Sj√∂berg, and directed by Sj√∂berg and David Berron. The first series broadcast on BBC Four in the United Kingdom from 16 September to 7 October 2017, with two episodes broadcast back-to-back each week. The first series was later released on Region 2 DVD on 9 October 2017. A second series was announced in 2017, serving as a prequel to the first. The main characters were Filip Berg, returning from the first series, joined by Hedda Stiernstedt, Daniel Larsson, David Nzinga, Bahar Pars and Alida Morberg. The second series follows Johan (Berg) as he and five other participants take place in a rehabilitation programme on the island of Kallsk√§r. The second series broadcast in Sweden and Denmark from October 2018, followed by a BBC Four broadcast commencing on 29 December 2018. A Region 2 DVD release has been set for 18 March 2019. Plot =Series 1 (2016)= Johan takes his brother and six friends to the north of Sweden because he is thinking of purchasing a disused ski hotel close to the border with Norway. It never officially opened because a family of four was murdered in the hotel's cellar shortly before it was due to open twenty years earlier. Johan's girlfriend, Hanne, who suffers long-term guilt over the death of her younger brother, quickly comes to believe that the building is possessed by the spirit of a dead child (a myling). At the same time, the surly caretaker, Erkki, is trying to scare them away from the property, with assistance from two Norwegian brothers who run a nearby snowmobile business. Having accepted Johan's marriage proposal, Hanne becomes friendly with Jostein, the younger of the brothers. Hanne has found a series of child's drawings and these seem to become reality during the stay. Sami words written on paper and walls around the hotel mean \\"kill or be killed\\". The group holds a seance where the ghost of a boy named Mikkel seems to be trying to contact them. Jessan, one of the women, gets a red eye, and starts to behave strangely. Hanne speaks to the detective who investigated the first murders. He tells her that he thinks Helgesen, the resort's previous owner, was not convinced he had done the killings despite confessing to the crime. When Jessan tries to kill her boyfriend, Frank, she is subdued and tied up. Hanne discovers from talking to her that Jessan has been having nightmares. Jessan then discovers her bindings have become loose and hides in the toilet. When the police break down the door, she is found dead with a frozen scream on her face. Osvald, who is secretly dating Johan's brother, gets a red eye and disappears in the cellar. Hanne finds the cellar door open and goes in to investigate, but is attacked and has to flee from the unseen attacker. In the cellar, she finds a secret room that contains medical files, relating to an earlier period when the hotel was a sanatorium. Hanne, her sister Mette, and Frank decide to leave, but Hanne thinks she sees a child in the road, and grabs the steering wheel, causing the vehicle to crash. Lippi is injured in the cellar after finding Osvald's dead body there. Mette, who is a doctor, returns just in time to save Lippi. Meanwhile, Elin, an old flame of Johan's, has a red eye and starts to walk around in a trance. Under the influence of the \\"kill or be killed\\" words, she strangles Lippi. When Johan finds her bracelet and realises she has killed his brother, he strangles her to death. Mette discovers that Erkki wants them gone because he has allowed Dag and Jostein to use part of the cellar for growing cannabis. Johan and Frank confront the brothers, but Dag stabs Johan and slits Frank's throat. When he attempts to kill Hanne, Jostein shoots Dag dead. Hanne walks into the mountains and communes with her dead brother, Jacob. During another seance, Hanne is attacked by something and gets a red eye. All three go to Erkki's house. He eventually admits that he and his half-brother Mikkel lived with their doctor father at the sanatorium. Erkki's mother was a Sami who had a relationship with his father. But because he believed in Aryan superiority he saw Erkki as belonging to an inferior race. After Erkki beat his brother in a fight, his angry father strangled Mikkel for being weak. After returning to the hotel, Hanne notices that one of the child's drawings shows the bed in the cellar's secret room with a space underneath. Climbing under the floor, she recovers the body of Mikkel. Before they can give the body respectful funeral rites, Erkki stops them. Johan, who now has a red eye, has survived the stabbing; he returns and shoots Erkki. However, outside the cellar Hanne kills Johan when he attempts to kill Jostein. Hanne, Mette and Jostein burn Mikkel's body on a traditional funerary pyre. They then pack their things and leave. However, on the drive back to civilisation, Jostein removes his sunglasses to reveal he now has a red eye.

Dilbar lookalike Sohrab, who is a robber by profession, forcibly takes Sanam Jahan (who was finding Dilbar) to his house, and also seize her Naagmani. Sanam Jahan later develops a fake love relationship with Sohrab to regain her Naagmani, but failed to do as Sohrab gave the Naagmani to Madam Kaali, a wolf who is a well wisher of human beings. On the other hand, Dilbar enters Haweli as a doctor for the treatment of Daa Ji (Wajahat), who is in a critical condition since the day Sanam Jahan bites him. Dilbar is basically on an aim to generate a baby through Muskaan, who refused to do so. He seeks the help of Sajna to convince Muskaan. Mehak is now under occupancy of Kaali, while Rayaan has been kidnapped by Salaaj, who sent Rayaan's look-alike Saawan (mongoose) to Haweli so that no one will become doubtful.

Few months later, Rayaan finally succeeds to escape from Salaaj and begin doubting on Muskaan's loyalty and love for him.

Muskaan manages to release Mehak and Daa Ji from Madam Kaali, who later reveals that both Muskaan and Sanam Jahan, and their sister Rani, belongs to royal tribe of serpents. Muskaan is now on a mission to save her family from Sanam Jahan, who has married Salman and has entered Haweli, while Rani has also appeared at the moment, to support her sister Sanam Jahan to avenge the death of their parents.

She went to India as the wife of Sutherland George Gordon Orr who led the 3rd regiment of cavalry. They had married on 7 March 1857 so they arrived as the indian mutiny took place. Sheikh Baran Bukh is given the credit for her survival. Her husband was involved in numerous operations where the British officers were trying to establish order with Indian troops.

Encouraged by the society she created a Handbook to the Works of Robert Browning assisted by advice from the animal artist John Trivett Nettleship. She was given access to Browning's letters by his sister and in 1891 she published Life and Letters of Robert Browning. The following year she re-published what became the sixth edition of Handbook to the Works of Robert Browning which contained her corrections. Orr published other smaller works including a description of the Browning's religious beliefs and articles against the proposal of Women's suffrage.

It is run by Canadians Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault and follows the old- school tabloid-style faux-journalism of its predecessors, such as the Weekly World News. Snopes.com reports that the website perpetrates hoaxes and rumors to prey on credulous readers. The website combines religious and scientific fakery, political conspiracy theories, and \\"the occasional seed of truth\\" to create its false reports. The Washington Post describes the World News Daily Report as a website that \\"delights in inventing items about foreigners, often Muslims, having sex with or killing animals\\". The website carries this disclaimer: \\"WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website even those based on real people are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.\\"  History  Since September 2013,https://web.archive.org/web/20130908120939/https://www.journaldemourreal.com Murray-Hall had been involved in creating a French-language site called Journal de Mourr√©al, intended to spoof the real Journal de Montr√©al. The Journal de Mourr√©al (a colloquial/slang name for the city) was ordered to stop using a similar logo as a trademark violation of the Journal de Montr√©al. Interviewed about the Journal, Legault said that \\"our main goal is to have fun with this medium, but we still want to get a message through. It is a criticism of sensationalism in the media\\". Murray-Hall and Legault founded World News Daily Report in November 2013.http://www.thatsfake.com/worldnewsdailyreport-com-real-fake/ Most fake news sites started after Facebook made significant changes to their newsfeed in March 2013, allowing fake news to proliferate. Radio Canada interviewed Olivier Legault about the Journal de Mourr√©al and World News Daily Report. They asked if he was concerned that people would believe the stories on the second site. Legault replied that the site was intended to encourage self- criticism, but also that it was people's fault if they wanted to believe fake stories. He continued, saying: > \\"The people who take it seriously are people who want to take it seriously. > It's stupid to say, but‚Ä¶ We preach to converts. The majority of people who > share it understand that it's a joke, and others share it because they want > to believe it, not because they really believe in it‚Ä¶ You can invent > everything and anything and people will believe it. Honestly, it's a little > disturbing when you realise that. As long as you confirm what they want to > believe, they will share it. If you go against their opinion, they will > immediately think that this is false news. But if you go in the direction of > their opinion, they will share it right away. They lose their critical > spirit.\\" Legault claimed that since Google had reduced advertising revenue to Fake News sites at the beginning of 2017, the site had become less profitable. \\"The worst thing is that you're doing 100,000 or 200,000 page views a day, but you're not making money on it\\", Legault said. Radio Canada estimated using HypeStat that \\"WNDR would generate some 21,593 page views and $120.80 per day\\" in advertising revenue. Murray-Hall also told Buzzfeed in 2017 that Google's move to reduce advertising revenue to fake news sites had reduced their revenues considerably: \\"Presently we aren't making any money at all, which is a real bummer so we don't know where WNDR is going to go from here. It's just a shame because WNDR is a monster, it can create major traffic like most sites could only dream of with only one post.‚Äù Reception In 2015, listing WNDR ninth among \\"The 9 Worst Fake News Sites,\\" Gizmodo allowed \\"the site doesn't always seem intent on deceiving people. But it's still not very good. Not very good at all.\\" Later that year, The Independent included WNDR among sites that \\"play fast and loose with the word 'news' while delivering material that's completely fabricated.\\" In 2016, fact-checking website Snopes.com said WNDR \\"often take[s] advantage of politically, socially, or religiously divisive issues to drive outrage-based traffic\\". That same year, however, ABC News identified WNDR as \\"a satirical entertainment news site,\\" and reproduced its online disclaimer reading, \\"WNDR assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website‚Äîeven those based on real people‚Äîare entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.\\" Also in 2016, the Columbia Journalism Review labeled WNDR as a fake news site despite having a legitimate-sounding name. At year-end, BuzzFeed recognized WNDR for scoring five times among the year's top 50 Biggest Fake News Hits On Facebook. In 2017, fact-checking website PolitiFact deemed WNDR \\"a satirical news site,\\" as did the Burlington County Times, while the Toronto Star cited WNDR as an example of \\"satirical sites posing as real news outlets.\\" Snopes regularly debunks WNDR articles, calling the site 'dubious', with 'a long record of entirely fabricated and sensationalist stories'. It also described its content as 'hate-baiting' and that its staff have a preoccupation with bestiality.

Flowering plants have up to seven translucent green flowers with darker green stripes. The flowers have a green labellum with a darker stripe down the middle. Non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves on a short, thin stalk but flowering plants lack the rosette, instead having five to seven stem leaves. Description Pterostylis chlorogramma, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Non-flowering plants have a rosette of between three and six lance-shaped to narrow egg-shaped leaves, each leaf long and wide on a thin stalk long. Flowering plants have up to seven translucent green flowers with darker green stripes on a flowering spike high. The flowers are long and wide. The flowering spike has between five and nine linear to lance-shaped stem leaves. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column with the dorsal sepal having a short point on its tip. The lateral sepals turn downwards, long, wide, joined for part of their length and suddenly narrow to thin points . The labellum is about long, wide, pale green with a dark geen stripe along its centre and a dark green mound on the top end. Flowering occurs from July to September. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis chlorogramma was first formally described in 1993 by David Jones and Mark Clements and the description was published in Muelleria from a specimen collected near Grantville. The specific epithet (chlorogramma) refers to the green stripes on the flowers. Distribution and habitat The green-striped leafy greenhood grows in heathy and shrubby forests near the Victorian coast between Yarram and Edenhope. There is some doubt about its distribution because of confusion with similar species of greenhood. Conservation Pterostylis chlorogramma is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"threatened\\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. Threats to the species include weed invasion, grazing by rabbits and macropods, and by tampling by people, during road maintenance and by trail bike activity.

The artist depicted genre subjects and still life elements in his works in a stark naturalist manner. The identity and nationality of the artist are not known. Art historians have yet to arrive at a unanimous view on the nationality, work location and the oeuvre of the artist. He may have been Italian, but a northern European background has also been proposed.Master of the Gamblers, Omnia vincit amor at Sotheby's Discovery and identification of the artist Omnia vincit amor The Italian art historian Gianni Papi coined the notname of the artist after he identified a number of paintings in a Caravaggist style as being by the same hand.Gianni Papi, Il Maestro dei giocatori, anche maestro di temi musicali, in: Caravaggio e la musica, a cura di S. Macioce e E. De Pascale, Roma, 2012, pp. 188-199 In a number of articles on the artist published starting from 1998 Papi has grouped a total of 25 works, which he ascribed to the artist. Master of the Gamblers, A kitchen interior with a sturgeon, a turtle, and the figure of an old man in red at Sotheby's These paintings mainly depict scenes with gamblers, dice players and sellers of food. It this thematic link, which formed the principal reason for grouping them together as by the same artist. The notname Master of the Gamblers was chosen because the first paintings given to the artist depicted players of cards and dice. Papi regards the artist as an Italian who was influenced by Caravaggio and close followers of Caravaggio such as Jos√© de Ribera, Cecco del Caravaggio and Tommaso Salini.Master of the Gamblers, A man holding a wine flask and a pipe at Sotheby's Other art historians have described the characteristics of the style of the artist as situated between the Italian Bartolomeo Manfredi and the Flemish artist Theodoor Rombouts. They therefore believe the artist to be a Flemish or Dutch follower of Caravaggio. Other scholars see similarities with the work of French Caravaggio follower Valentin de Boulogne and therefore believe the artist to be French. The work location of the artist has also been the subject of dispute. While most scholars place the artist in Rome in the 1620s and 1630s some believe he worked in Naples. Work About 25 works have been attributed to the artist. The majority of the work of the artist deals with genre subjects of a picaresque nature such as gamblers including dice players; card players and morra players, musicians, sellers of fruit and vegetables and kitchen scenes, which were the type of low life scenes typically treated by Caravaggio and his followers. Another subject he depicted is The incredulity of St Thomas (At Sotheby's on 14-15 June 2011, Milan, lot 22 as 'Caravaggesque school'), also a theme treated by Caravaggio. An exception is the Omnia vincit amor (At Sotheby's London sale on 9 December 2009, lot 31), which shows a victorious Cupid based on a popular quotation from Virgil's Eclogues. Dice-players and a bird-seller gathered around a stone slab The paintings attributed to the Master of the Gamblers are in a style reminiscent of other followers of Caravaggio but in particular of that of the young Jos√© de Ribera. The artist's work is close to that of the Caravaggesque painter Pietro Paolini who was also active in Rome around the same time. In the horizontal format and stylistic elements as well as his frequent treatment of musicians and musical instruments his works are reminiscent of Paolini. At the same time, the artist was able to forge his own style, which has made it relatively easy to identify his works. The characteristics of the Master's style are a vigorous, almost brutal, expressionism and naturalism, strong linear and characterful depictions of his figures' faces and gestures, crumbled surfaces and treating objects with a dramatic sculptural quality.Maestro dei Giocatori (active in Rome circa 1620/30), The beggar at Dorotheum The Master of the Gamblers showed a strong interest in still life painting and many of his pictures with fruit and vegetable sellers give ample space to the still life elements, which are worked out extensively. The still life elements in his works are rendered with a strong naturalism reminiscent of Cecco del Caravaggio References External links  * Category:17th- century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Italian Baroque painters ","title":"Master of the Gamblers"},{"id":"53922288","title":"Japan-United States Friendship Act of 1975"},{"id":"53922293","text":"Alfred Joseph Ivie IV (born January 22, 1995) is an American football defensive tackle for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL).

Plot One morning in a house, Krazy is sleeping in his bed. He then wakes up to the chirping of the birds, and acknowledges that today is his wedding day. Upon getting up from bed, he kisses every photograph of his spaniel girlfriend. He then heads to the bathroom to shave and shower. The scene then moves to another house where the spaniel is ironing her long ears. The spaniel then heads to a window where instead of donning a wedding gown, she simply takes out one of the curtains, and places it on her head like a veil. Momentarily, Krazy shows up outside wearing a tux, a top hat, and in a car. Krazy elevates a seat from his car which the spaniel boards from the window. The two then set off. Krazy and the spaniel make it to the church. The wedding is hyped up by dancing turkeys and cattle. When Krazy and the spaniel gather in front of the priest, the priest does not say much other than singing \\"do-do-do‚Ä¶\\" in a jazzy fashion. The priest, however, completes the wedding by tying together the tails of the two sweethearts.

As a two-year-old she was rated the best British-trained filly of her generation after winning the Prix du Calvados and finishing second under top weight in the Fillies' Mile. In the following year she was a top- class performer over middle distances, winning the Irish Oaks, finishing third in the Yorkshire Oaks and fourth in both the Champion Stakes and the Washington, D.C. International Stakes. After her retirement from racing she had a successful career a broodmare, producing Street Cry and Helsinki, the dam of Shamardal. Background Helen Street was a \\"big, rangy, quite attractive\\" bay mare with a small white star bred and owned by Arnold Weinstock and Michael Sobell of the Ballymacoll Stud. She was sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. She was from the second of four crops of foals sired by Troy, an outstanding middle-distance performer who won The Derby, Irish Derby, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and International Stakes in 1979. Troy died in 1983, a year before Helen Street began her racing career. Her dam Waterway was a very good racemare (rated 112 by Timeform) who won the Prix du Calvados and finished third to Three Troikas in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. She was descended from the influential British broodmare Sunny Gulf who was the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Sun Princess, Conduit, Neo Universe, Millenary, Petrushka and Spectrum. Racing career =1984: two-year-old season= Helen Street made her racecourse debut in the Virginia Water Stakes, for previously unraced fillies over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse in July. She won by a neck from the Henry Cecil-trained Batave, with a gap of seven lengths back to the other eight runners. In the following month the filly was sent to France and stepped up in class and distance to contest the Group 3 Prix du Calvados (a race which her mother had won in 1978) over 1400 metres at Deauville Racecourse. Ridden by Willie Carson she started favourite against seven opponents headed by the Prix Yacowlef winner Breath Taking. she tracked the leader Exgravity before going to the front at half way and drawing clear in the closing stages to win by a \\"long-looking\\" three lengths from Elisharp and Northern Walker. The form of the race was subsequently franked when Northern Walker finished second, beaten less than a length, in the Group 1 Prix de la Salamandre. Helen Street returned to England for the Fillies' Mile at Ascot in September in which, as a Group race winner, she was required to concede weight to her seven opponents. She made steady progress in the straight but was beaten one and a half lengths by the favourite Oh So Sharp, who was carrying four pounds less. =1985: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old Helen Street contested the Nell Gwyn Stakes (a trial for the 1000 Guineas) over even furlongs at Newmarket on 18 April and finished third behind Oh So Sharp and Bella Colora. She was then stepped up in distance for the Musidora Stakes (a trial for The Oaks) at York Racecourse on 14 May. She started 2/1 favourite but after having trouble obtaining a clear run she finished fourth behind Fatah Flare, Dubian and Ever Genial. Despite her two defeats she was still strongly fancied when she was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 13 July. Dubian, who had finished third to Oh So Sharp and Triptych in the Epsom Oaks started favourite ahead of Sally Brown with Helen Street next in the betting on 3/1. The only other fillies given any chance in the nine-runner field were Alydar's Best (winner of the Grand Crit√©rium) and Fair of the Furze. After restraining his mount at the rear of the field Carson switched Helen Street to the outside to make her challenge in the straight. She took the lead entering the last quarter mile and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths from Alydar's Best with Dubian taking third ahead of Sally Brown. On 20 August Helen Street started the 8/11 favourite for the Yorkshire Oaks but was beaten in a close finish as she took third, three quarters of a length and a head behind Sally Brown and Kiliniski. In her three remaining races the filly was matched against top-class male opposition in major weight-for-age races. In the Irish Champion Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 8 September she reached fourth place early in the straight but then looked outpaced and finished sixth behind Commanche Run, Bob Back, Damister, Scottish Reel and Baillamont with Theatrical in seventh and Triptych tenth of the eleven runners. On her final European start, Helen Street was one of ten horses to contest an exceptionally strong renewal of the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 19 October, and finished fourth behind Pebbles, Slip Anchor and Palace Music. Helen Street ended her racing career with a trip to the United States for the Washington, D.C. International Stakes at Laurel Park on 16 November. Starting a 19.5/1 outsider she stayed on well in the stretch and finished fourth behind Vanlandingham, Yashgan and Jupiter Island, beaten two and a quarter lengths by the winner. Assessment In 1984 the independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 114 p (the \\"p\\" indicating that she was likely to make more than usual progress), making her 11 pounds inferior to their best two-year-old filly Triptych. In the official International classification she was rated the third best juvenile filly in Europe behind Triptych and the Irish-trained Park Appeal. In the following year she was rated 123 by Timeform, eight pounds behind their best three-year- old filly Oh So Sharp. In the International classification she was rated the tenth-best three-year-old filly in Europe eleven pounds behind Oh So Sharp. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Helen Street was acquired by Sheikh Mohammed and was retired to become a broodmare. She produced at least thirteen foals and ten winners between 1987 and 2004: *Ilia, a bay filly, foaled in 1987, sired by Shadeed. Unraced. *Helenus, bay colt (later gelded), 1988, by Danzig.

The fortress was built in 1659 to defend against Tibetan invasions. The dzong hosted a monastic community besides acting as the central administrative center of the Trashigang District, before they were shifted due to the ongoing restoration.  History  The fortress was built in 1659 atop a ledge with steep cliffs on three sides, overlooking the Drangme Chhu and Gamri Chhu rivers. The construction of the dzong was prophesied by Ngawang Namgyal who ordered the Penlop (Governor) of Trongsa, Chhogyal Minjur Tempa to put down local chieftains and construct the dzong. According to legend, the sight of the Dzong scared the Tibetan army which retreated while remarking that the Dzong was a \\"Sky Dzong and was not on the ground\\". The dzong was further expanded by Gyalsey Tenzin Rabgye between 1680 and 1694 and by Dzongpon Dopola in 1936. The dzong was consecrated and named as Trashigang by Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje. After the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Bhutan allowed Indian soldiers returning home to pass through Eastern Bhutan. However they were required to deposit their rifles at the armoury in the Dzong, and proceed through Bhutan unarmed. The rifles lie in the Dzong to this day. The dzong celebrates the four day long Trashigang Tshechu festival every year, with around 1500 people attending the celebrations on each day.  Conservation  The dzong developed wide cracks as a result of the 2009 Bhutan earthquake, whose epicenter was away from the dzong. A partnership between World Monuments Fund, Prince Claus Fund and the Bhutan Foundation was instrumental for assistance in emergency repairs at the dzong. In February 2014, the Government of India allotted Nu.190 million for renovating the dzong. The renovation works are expected to be completed by June 2018, while the costs have risen to Nu.227.5 million. A drasha (monk hostel) for 50 monks, besides a tshokhang (dining area) are built outside the dzong's premises for safety and health reasons. The government is also recruiting local unemployed youth to construct the dzong, and will be using locally sourced materials in the construction, including timber mostly from Bumthang and stones from Chazam. The Trashigang district administrative offices have been temporarily relocated to the Trashigang Middle Secondary School while the clergy were moved to a school in Samkhar Gewog, about 10 km away from the dzong.

The English name wood woolly-foot has been given to this species. Naming This species was originally described by James Bolton in his 1788 book \\"An history of fungusses, growing about Halifax\\" as Agaricus peronatus at a time when all gilled mushrooms were assigned to genus Agaricus. Then in 1821 another Englishman, Samuel Frederick Gray published his ‚ÄúNatural Arrangement of British Plants‚Äù (including fungi) in which he allocated the species to the already existing genus Gymnopus. In 1791 Bulliard described the same species as Agaricus urens, the epithet \\"urens\\" (\\"burning\\") referring to the acrid taste, and in 1836 Fries put it genus Marasmius. Also in 1871 Paul Kummer put this mushroom in genus Collybia, giving it the name Collybia peronata. For many years it was known either as Marasmius urens or Collybia peronata (or sometimes Marasmius peronatus or Collybia urens). The peronatus and urens forms have been distinguished as different species, urens having a lighter- coloured cap, but this view is outdated. In much later work culminating in 1997, Anton√≠n and Noordeloos found that the genus Collybia as defined at that time was unsatisfactory due to being polyphyletic and they proposed a fundamental rearrangement. They resurrected the genus Gymnopus for some species including peronata, and after subsequent DNA studies, this has been accepted by modern authorities including Species Fungorum and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and so its current name has reverted to Gray's combination, Gymnopus peronatus. The species name peronatus indicates that the stem is \\"booted\\" with a hairy covering below (from the Latin peronatus meaning \\"rough-booted\\"). Description The following sections use the given references throughout. =General= Yellowish specimens *The cap grows from about 2 cm to 6 cm, and is yellowish or reddish brown. *There is no ring or other veil remnant. The stem is roughly the same colour as the cap and up to about 8 cm long and only 0.5 cm in diameter. It is typically pruinose (\\"frosted\\") above and strigose (hairy) near the base. *The well-spaced gills are concolorous with the cap or somewhat lighter. *The undamaged mushroom has little smell, but on bruising it has an aroma of vinegar. The taste is acrid or peppery. =Microscopic characteristics= *The elongated comma-shaped spores are around 8 ¬µm by 4 ¬µm. *It has irregular coralloid cheilocystidia. =Distribution, habitat & ecology= This saprobic mushroom grows generally in smaller or larger clumps on leaves or needles in deciduous or coniferous woods and may be found from May to December. It is common throughout Europe, and has also been reported from a few sites in America and Japan. Edibility This fungus is generally regarded as inedible, mainly because of its peppery or acrid taste, and has little human impact. However, according to one Spanish web site it may be dried, ground up, and used as a condiment. One 1948 paper states that this species generates hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in detectable amounts, suggesting that it is poisonous. However the same paper lists other mushrooms normally considered edible, such as Infundibulicybe geotropa, as having the same characteristic, so it is difficult to know how much significance to attribute to this observation.

These projects provided to other countries deal with healthcare, infrastructure, development, alleviating poverty, responding to natural disasters, refugees and internally displaced people. Objectives The purpose of UAE aid is to increase international peace and stability through the eradication of poverty, while guaranteeing improvements in the living standards of individuals regardless of their religion, language, identity and race. Aid is continually provided to ensure the establishment of effective partnerships. The UAE is also committed in executing sustainable development programs in order to support developing countries reach their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A report published for 2017-2021 focuses on country's specific development plans and their priorities of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the UAE also hopes to focus on neglected issues and communities. Another guiding principle is to have aid transparent and focused on results. According to the UAE interact website  History  Foreign aid first began with one of the oldest development agencies in the UAE, called Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, founded in 1971. Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) assists countries through economic support in the form of concessionary loans to reach sustainable socio-economic progress. Administration On February 2006, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Following a restructure of the cabinet in 2016 led to the creation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, where one of its several tasks is to overlook development aid by the UAE. The UAE's official development assistance (ODA) measured as a share of Gross National Income achieved 1.17% in 2014 and 1.12% in 2016. This is higher than the United Nations' agreement for countries to give 0.7% of their Gross National Income (GNI) as official development aid yearly, ranking the UAE as highest contributor of all countries reporting to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC). The UAE also provides funding that falls beyond the scope of Official Development Assistance. Benn, J. and W. Luijkx (2017), \\"Emerging providers‚Äô international co-operation for development\\", OECD Development Co-operation Working Papers, No. 33, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/15d6a3c7-en. Regions While other countries have received aid from the United Arab Emirates, these countries within the two continents have been particularly focused on. = Africa =  Egypt  From 1971 to 2014 the UAE's humanitarian and development aid to Egypt equaled to US$12.8 billion. In 2013, the largest receiver of the UAE's government development aid was directed to Egypt. In that same year, an agreement was created aimed at supporting the economy and financial system. Many different sectors were targeted, including agriculture, transport, health, education, infrastructure development, water and sanitation that have all contributed to the recovery of Egypt.  Sudan  From 2014 to 2015 there has been a sevenfold increase of UAE assistance in Sudan, which received US$108.2 million. The sectors focused on were general program assistance, agriculture and education. The aid was equally divided between loans and grants. For the agriculture sector, assistance was mostly provided by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development to help secure drinking water, increase the size of lands and provide extra electricity through hydraulic generation. For education, the Al Maktoum Foundation donated to support the costs of the International University of Africa. = Asia= Afghanistan The UAE's mission of delivering humanitarian aid to the Afghan people since 2003 has been to maintain security and support social and economic development in remote areas. All of the funds received from the UAE were provided in the form of grants, focusing on infrastructure development, health, humanitarian and emergency relief. The Government has provided US$30million specifically for reconstruction efforts with the UAE Red Crescent investing US$19million in local projects. Additionally, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development has spent US$29 million for the execution of 40,000 social housing units. Some of the contributions include: * 11 schools educating 300 students a day * 1 public library serving more than 400 people * 6 medical clinics that have treated 35,000 Afghani's * 38 mosques each serving 300 people * 160 wells providing drinking water In January 2017, diplomats were expected to initiate several UAE-backed projects including humanitarian, educational and developmental as part of an aid program. One particular project in the city of Kabul was signing an agreement with Kardan University to offer scholarships funded by the UAE. During that trip five of the UAE officials were killed in a bomb attack in Kandahar, the southern of Afghanistan. Survivors stated that the bombs were hidden under sofas in the governor's guesthouse. The UAE's ambassador to Afghanistan was one of the six killed. The UAE leaders have responded to this act of terror by stating they will not be discouraged and the UAE's humanitarian efforts will not stop.

Cunningham and Marguerite) was a 19th-century American author from Iowa. She wrote sketches, short stories, poems, and several novels. Collier is remembered for Lilith, The Legend of the First Woman (1885). Early years and education Ada Langworthy was born in Dubuque, Iowa, December 23, 1843, in the first frame house ever built within the present bounds of the State of Iowa. She was a descendant of James Langworthy, of Vermont; and Sergt. Jonathan Massey and Jonathan Woodbury, of New Hampshire; and a granddaughter of Dr. Stephen Langworthy and Betsey Massey. Her father, Lucius Hart Langworthy, a descendant of New England pioneers, was among the very first to explore the lead regions of Iowa, and he was one of the founders of the city of Dubuque. Her mother, Valeria A. Bemis, was a member of an old Baltimore family. Though she lived a pioneer life, she did not face the hardships known by others. The lead mines made her father and his brothers wealthy, and soon a group of brick mansions were built on a bluff above the city, where the family lived. In early girlhood, Collier studied at a Dubuque girls' school taught by Catharine Beecher. Afterward, she went to Lasell Seminary, Auburndale, Massachusetts, graduating in 1861, at the age of 17, even though she had been ill with \\"brain fever\\". Career Collier began to write for periodicals in her childhood. She was the author of many sketches, tales and short poems, of several novels, and of one long, narrative poem, \\"Lilith\\" (Boston, 1885); the last was her greatest work. She occasionally used pen names, including \\"Anna L. Cunningham\\" and \\"Marguerite\\".

It was developed as one of twenty-four programs scheduled for broadcast on the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries during the 2010‚Äì11 television season. Anna Sandor and Diane Mettler wrote the film; Howard Meltzer, Jane Goldenring, and Ted Bauman served as executive producers. Shannen Doherty and Kavan Smith star as the lead characters. One commentator noted that the film marked a transition for Doherty away from her \\"bad girl\\" reputation. The plot revolves around radio personality Emma Silver, played by Doherty, as she attempts to pay off her recently deceased grandfather's debts by entering a pumpkin growing contest. As the movie progresses, a romance develops between her and her new neighbor Seth Cullen, portrayed by Smith. She must choose if she wants to stay in her rural hometown or accept a promising job opportunity in New York City. Mettler's brother's experiences participating in pumpkin growing contests was the inspiration for the film's narrative. It was filmed and produced over the course of a few days in October 2009. The film premiered on October 23, 2010, as the start of the Hallmark Channel's Countdown to Halloween programming block. It received a Nielsen rating of 2.6 million viewers, which made it the second highest performing television movie on all ad-supported cable television networks for the night. Critical response to Growing the Big One was largely positive; some critics praised the story and Doherty's performance, while others were more critical of the chemistry between the two lead actors. It was released on DVD three days following the film's premiere. Plot Emma Silver is a radio personality who relocated from New York City to establish her career in Seattle. After hearing of her grandfather Walt's death, Emma returns to her childhood home in Valleyville, Washington. After meeting with the attorney Bobby Ellis, Emma discovers that she has inherited Walt's farm and pumpkin seeds. Bobby suggests that Walt wanted Emma to enter the local pumpkin growing contest to keep up a family tradition. In his last letter, Walt instructs his granddaughter to find someone to take care of the farm. Emma's new neighbor Seth Cullen contemplates asking Emma for Walt's seeds so that he can enter the contest and win its grand prize, which would allow him to open his own automobile repair shop. Emma and Seth first meet when he is repairing her front door and she mistakes him for a burglar. During Walt's funeral, Emma learns that Walt was in debt. Bobby tells her that the entire debt must be paid by the end of the year or the farm will be foreclosed. Mayor Kyle Finster informs Emma that he intends to develop the land following its foreclosure. Emma is dismayed to learn that she has been replaced by a younger radio host and is reassigned to a gardening program she is tasked to video broadcast via webcams installed in Walt's farmhouse. Emma talks to Seth about his future business plans, and later learns that the grand prize for the pumpkin growing contest will be doubled if the entry weighs more than the world record. She decides to enter the contest. Her first broadcast is a disaster because of her lack of familiarity with the subject. A group of women from the town known as the \\"Pumpkin Widows\\" spend time with Emma and begin teaching her about growing pumpkins, and tell her of Walt's practice of singing \\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\\" to his seeds. They are called the Pumpkin Widows because their husbands focus all of their energy on growing pumpkins. A video of Emma and the women serenading the pumpkin seeds goes viral, leading Emma's new boss to coordinate a campaign for her program around the pumpkin growing contest. Following the women's suggestion, Emma searches for and finds Walt's journal containing all of his pumpkin growing secrets. She discovers that Walt documented all of his strategies in code. After Seth helps to translate a portion of the journal, he tries to partner with her, but she refuses believing she must grow the pumpkins by herself. Emma is unable to spread manure as she falls down while attempting to use the tiller. During a poker game Seth wins a bet which forces Emma to collaborate with him for the contest. While they work together, Seth participates in Emma's radio program. Bobby informs Seth about her reasons for joining the contest. The pair's pumpkins growth is slow, and Seth and Emma often clash during their collaboration. They grow closer while watching old films together and discussing their pasts. Seth talks about his degree in engineering from Stanford University and his decision to move out of the city in favor of the country, and Emma reveals her childhood dream of hosting her own talk show. When they are interviewed by Emma as part of her show, the Pumpkin Widows share stories of their husbands' obsessions with growing pumpkins. Emma and Seth sneak onto the mayor's farm to find out his pumpkin growing secrets. Emma asks Seth on a date while they appear at a promotional photo shoot in Seattle. Their date is interrupted by Emma accepting an offer from a television executive to be an anchor on a New York City morning news program. The pair's pumpkin starts growing larger; Emma finds the real pumpkin growing journal and learns that the other book was actually Walt's poems to his wife. Emma and Seth win the contest, and beat the record. Rejecting the New York job offer, Emma starts her own talk show in Valleyville along with Seth. Emma pays off Walt's debt with the prize money, and Seth opens his own car repair shop. The film ends with the couple becoming engaged.

Howard Meltzer, Jane Goldenring, and Ted Bauman served as the film's executive producers; Randolph Cheveldave was its producer. Production was handled by GBO Films. The film's music was edited by James Hazell, and Mahlon Todd Williams was its cinematographer. Growing the Big One was promoted as part of Hallmark's collection of original, holiday movies. It was one of twenty-four films scheduled for broadcast on the Hallmark Channel and its affiliate digital cable and satellite television channel Hallmark Movies & Mysteries for the 2010‚Äì11 television season. While discussing the reasons behind the scheduling decisions, Barbara Fisher, the senior vice president of Hallmark Channel's programming, said: \\"Original movies will continue to be the centerpiece of our prime time schedule as we broaden our entire programming mix and as we transition our daytime to home and lifestyle-oriented programming.\\" =Filming and post-production= Filming took place partially in the Canadian village of alt=A yellow two-story building with a freshly-mowed lawn and two flagpoles. On October 14, 2009, the Hallmark Channel issued a press release announcing that Doherty was cast as the star for the television film; Kavan Smith was confirmed as her co-star on March 23, 2010. Filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia with production beginning in October 2009. Several scenes were shot in Fort Langley, British Columbia. Hazell said that the entire project was filmed on location since \\"[they] managed to find great locations to give [the] film its country feeling\\". The pumpkins were modelled after champion pumpkins from the United States and Canada. Doherty completed filming her scenes shortly before her participation as a contestant on the tenth season of the reality competition show Dancing with the Stars. Nancy Mills of USA Today wrote that Doherty's performance in the project marked her transition away from her earlier \\"bad girl\\" image, stemming from her arrest for driving under the influence and vandalism and subsequent anger management counseling. Doherty said that she decided to work on more family-friendly films for \\"[her] goddaughter and for [her] brother's seven kids\\", adding that: \\"[she] get[s] joy out of their watching something [her] brother approves of. They can all sit around and talk about it and call [her] afterward.\\" She found the role and the film to be \\"lighter and fluffier\\" compared with her earlier work. The actress connected with Silver through their shared dedication to their careers and their decisions to re-prioritize their lives. When approaching her character, Doherty felt that Silver's story arc was about \\"honoring her grandfather and finding good friends, a sense of community and love\\"; she connected with this story line because of her close connections to her own family. Broadcast history and release A sneak peek and a behind- the-scenes video were released before the film's debut. Growing the Big One was first broadcast on October 23, 2010, on the Hallmark Channel at 9 pm Eastern Standard Time in the United States. It served as the start of the network's \\"Countdown to Halloween\\" programming block. During the promotion of the television project, the network's executives said that it was \\"the first film to be harvested in the network's three-month countdown to the holidays\\". It received a Nielsen rating of 2.6 million viewers, which made it the second highest performing television movie on all ad-supported cable television networks for the night. It was also the third highest rated movie for October 23, 2010, for women between the ages of 25 and 54, and helped make the Hallmark Channel the fourth highest rated cable network for that day. The movie was released for home viewing on DVD on October 26, 2010. It was released with the tagline, \\"Love Grows In Funny Places\\", and promoted as \\"family entertainment\\". Critical reception Critical response was largely positive, with Angelique Flores of Home Media magazine calling it \\"wholesome, sweet and refreshing\\" and an appropriate alternative to the typical horror films shown during Halloween. Entertainment Weekly's Mandi Bierly praised the film's title, writing: \\"This is one title we'll enjoy adding to the 'city girl needs to move to the country to find a man' genre\\". Bierly compared the filming style and locations to those used in the American comedy-drama television series Gilmore Girls (2000‚Äì2007), and said that she was \\"obsessed\\" with the Hallmark television movie. Echoing Bierly's sentiment, Michelle of the online news magazine TV Equals described Growing the Big One as \\"my absolute favorite kind of television holiday movie\\". The Los Angeles Times' Ed Stockly included the film in his guide to Halloween on television. Jessica Leigh Mattern wrote that Growing the Big One would appeal to fans of the television series When Calls the Heart. Laura Fries of Variety provided a more mixed review of Growing the Big One, calling it a \\"corny, or more adequately, 'seedy' original pic\\" reminiscent of the 1987 film Baby Boom. Fries praised Doherty's performance as \\"showing more warmth and charisma than seen in a good while\\" and the performances and relationships in the small-town community, but was critical of Smith's acting and the chemistry between the two lead actors.

There he deployed to Afghanistan as a HUMINT case officer assigned to provide direct support to US Special Operations Command (USSCOM). Kurush then again deployed to Afghanistan in 2004 in the capacity of the Commander of a Defense HUMINT base where critical HUMINT activities were conducted during US surge operations in Afghanistan. These operations were in support of Afghanistan's first democratic elections after the fall to the Taliban and al- Qaeda. In 2005, Kurush deployed to Iraq as a Senior HUMINT Advisor where he helped facilitate an inter-agency coordination cell. Upon completion of that assignment he later returned to serve as the Chief of the Military Group and Senior Department of Defense Instructor at a prestigious inter-agency intelligence training institution. Finally, in May 2009 Kurush assumed command of the US Army Field Support Center (AFSC). =Death and afterward= KB assuming command at the Army's Field Support Center During his last assignment at AFSC, Kurush was diagnosed and died as a result of pancreatic cancer.

A year later in October 2011, the Defense Intelligence Agency's (DIA) Contingency Operation Base located in Kabul, Afghanistan was renamed to Camp K.B. Reid in honor of Kurush's service. The renaming of Camp KB Reid Additionally, in 2012, DIA established a new DIA training facility in Norfolk, VA dedicated as the Reid Center. These dedications were undertaken to illustrate the considerable impact Kurush had on the US Intelligence Community (IC) at large and the Defense HUMINT function. Finally, in February 2014, the US Army's HUMINT Training Joint Center of Excellence (HT-JCOE) established an Honor Graduate Program in recognition of outstanding student performance in the Source Operations Course (SOC) and the Defense Advanced Tradecraft Course (DATC).Honor Graduate Program Today, both uniformed service members and civilians are awarded the COL Kurush Bharucha-Reid Award for Excellence in HUMINT Tradecraft. Honors, decorations, awards and distinctions In addition to Kurush's career achievements his awards include: The Defense Superior Service Medal, Bronze Star Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, Defense Meritorious Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, Meritorious Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, Army Achievement Medal, and the Ranger, Special Forces, Pathfinder, Master Parachutist, and Military Free Fall Jump Master badges. KB was a Jump Master and High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) certified. In addition, Kurush received the Office of Strategic Service Society's Donovan Award and was inducted into the US Army's Military Intelligence Hall of Fame in 2014.

Her work with glass electrolytes was recognized by Goodenough as important, and she was persuaded to join his group to further this research. Glass-amorphous solid electrolytes in the form of Ba-doped Li-glass and Ba- doped Na-glass are proposed by Braga as a solution to problems identified with organic liquid electrolytes used in modern lithium-ion battery cells. Sodium is easier to obtain and more environmentally friendly than lithium, and the glass electrolyte eliminates the possibility of short circuit. Batteries based on this new design may store three times as much energy as comparable Li-ion cells. In addition, designs based upon Bragas research improve the existing limitation of 500 charge cycles in Li-ion to over 1200 charge cycles and over a wider temperature range. Braga and colleagues at Materials for Energy Research Group in University of Porto host research projects related to glass electrolyte, magnetic refrigerators, catalyst for fuel cell reactions, and other advanced materials research.

In 1143 it affiliated itself as a daughter house of the Cistercian primary Clairvaux Abbey. At this point it was transferred to an allod on the bank of the Garonne, where it carried out viniculture, horse-breeding, and cattle-breeding. Belleperche became one of the largest monasteries in southern France, with eight granges, including Angeville, and 60-80 monks in its heyday. The original building was already replaced by 1230 with a new construction on enlarged foundations on the riverbank. In 1563 a new Abbot's lodge was erected. The abbey's decline began with the Hundred Years' War, and further damages were caused in 1572, during the Huguenot Wars. The monastery was restored (1604-1614), but was dissolved in 1791 as a result of the French Revolution. The abbey was converted into a castle, agricultural estates, and domestic residences, and unused buildings were demolished or fell into ruin. A restoration was begun in 1993.  Buildings and estates  The now demolished church was consecrated in 1263. It was 75 metres long and 20 wide, with polychromatic floor-tiles and an octagonal bell tower, modelled on Saint Sernin in Toulouse, above the crossing. The six bays of the chapter house were vaulted between 1250 and 1255. The rectangular cloister measured approximately 46 x 38 metres.

It was Hewitt's only educational institution up to 1952, hosting first grade through high school at its peak. It was also a key venue for community events, public health services, and extracurricular agricultural instruction. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 for having local significance in the theme of education. It was nominated for its central role in educating and socializing not only Hewitt's children but its adult population as well. Beginning in 1981 the Hewitt Historical Society has developed the former school into the Hewitt Museum & Library. It interprets the history and culture of Hewitt and the surrounding Stowe Prairie Township. Description Hewitt Public School is a cruciform building rising two and a half stories. Its dominant visual feature is a cross-gambrel roof, which rises to on the shorter ridgeline and on the longer. The walls are poured concrete covered with stucco, on a foundation of granite ashlars. The main fa√ßade is symmetrical and complexly fenestrated. Narrow arched windows flank the main entrance and a Palladian window is centered on the attic level. The rectangular windows feature elaborate hood moulds while the arched and round windows feature elongated keystone moulds. The central section projecting toward the street has corner pilasters topped by elaborate cornices. The front entrance leads into a foyer, which has a staircase on either side leading up to the second floor. There are three classrooms on the first floor. The second floor consists of two classrooms on the left, an auditorium in the middle, and three small rooms on the right that served as a superintendent's office, library, and supply room. The basement level contained classrooms for art and chemistry, the cafeteria, restrooms, and a boiler room. A one-story addition is attached to the southeast corner of the school. It contains a gymnasium, a kitchen, a meeting room, and restrooms. The gymnasium was built in 1952 and the rest added in 1980. Background and construction The town of Hewitt was platted in 1891 and opened its first school the following year. By the end of the first decade of the 20th century the original building was getting cramped, due more to state initiatives that improved attendance by farm children than any major population growth. At this time state and national education officials were also pushing for consolidation of schools, doing away with the one-room schoolhouses that peppered the countryside. In 1911 a new state law offered grants for construction and operation of larger schools centrally located in towns. Officials from Hewitt's school district convinced the surrounding rural districts to consolidate with them. The school board hired architect C. Howard Parsons of Minneapolis, who had designed schools in nearby Long Prairie, Wadena, Sauk Centre, and Little Falls. Parsons and the local building committee decided to construct the new school entirely out of concrete. This was a fairly novel building material at the time, garnering widespread praise as durable, fireproof, and modern. Construction began in May 1911 with local laborers under the supervision of Minneapolis-based contractor Medson Brothers. They used a pulley and a horse to raise buckets of cement to cast the two-story walls. Use =Education= The consolidated Hewitt Public School opened in the fall of 1911, originally housing grades one through eight plus one year of high school. Upgrades to the heating, plumbing, ventilation, and electrical systems in the 1920s allowed the district to offer two more years of high school. Government funds for these improvements also mandated better library facilities, lighting, science equipment, administration, and record keeping. With these reforms in place, intended to increase student performance on state exams, Hewitt Public School was promoted to a full four- year high school in 1931. =Public health= Hewitt Public School served as the base of operations in Hewitt and the surrounding Stowe Prairie Township for public health efforts, a growing national focus after World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic. A public health nurse sponsored by the Red Cross worked out of the school beginning in 1920, providing childhood health screenings, vaccinations, and classes for local women on nutrition, cooking, and first aid. In this period the sick were usually cared for at home by family members rather than being hospitalized, so the nurse also provided education to caregivers and housecalls to local tuberculosis patients. =Agricultural instruction= The Smith‚ÄìLever Act of 1914 provided government funding for agricultural and home economics instruction, and once again Hewitt Public School was the main local venue for these programs. Offered by the state's cooperative extension service, they helped introduce agricultural communities to the latest and most effective methods of raising crops and livestock. One popular program was the school garden, which students helped plan, plant, tend, harvest, and preserve (the canned produce then being used in school lunches throughout the year). During World War II, agricultural extension services were a key tool for the national and state government to try to boost farm production and address wartime shortages. These programs helped recruit additional farm labor, collect scrap metal, share fertilizer and machinery, and encourage children to buy war savings stamps. They held classes on cooking with local produce and substituting for unavailable foods. Meanwhile, the school's faculty took charge of local sugar rationing. =Community venue= Like all public schools at the time, the Hewitt building was also intended to serve as a community center. The auditorium hosted plays, concerts, and lectures. Community groups, many led by the school's own teachers, met in the classrooms after hours. Demand for space was high enough that the school board instituted a rental fee in 1922, though organizations open to the public (such as the Boy Scouts) were exempted. Closure and reuse Graduating classes from the high school were never large, hitting a maximum of 16 in 1943. In 1946 only four students graduated. The declining enrollment led the school board to approve closing the high school in 1948, but community members successfully lobbied to keep it open. Despite the local support and the addition of a gymnasium in 1952, the school's superintendent stated that \\"there will soon be too few pupils left to operate even a grade school in Hewitt.\\" The Minnesota State Board of Education, pushing for consolidation with nearby Bertha, finally broke through the opposition by promising that the grade school would remain in Hewitt. Beginning in 1953 the older students began attending classes in Bertha, while grades one through six continued meeting at Hewitt Public School. In 1964, however, that was dropped to just fifth and sixth grades, and the school closed permanently in December 1979. The building and its grounds were sold to the city of Hewitt for one dollar. The Hewitt Lions Club was granted a 99-year lease on the gymnasium for use as a community center, adding a meeting room and kitchen to that wing in 1980. The following year the Hewitt Historical Society organized and began using the main section as a museum. Outside, half of the former schoolyard has been developed as a public park. In 2010 the building's roof and windows were restored with a grant from the Minnesota Historical Society funded by the 2008 Clean Water, Land, and Legacy Amendment. With books donated by the school library of Eagle Bend, the historical society opened a lending library in one of the former classrooms in 2011. The society aims to offer internet access as well to help make up for the lack of a public library in Hewitt.

United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), is a 1968 United States Supreme Court ruling in which the Court held that a defendant was deprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause if a confession by his codefendant was introduced in their joint trial, regardless of whether the jury received instructions only to consider it against the confessor. This has become known as the Bruton rule. The case overruled Delli Paoli v. United States (1957). Reasoning As the basis for its holding, the Supreme Court stated that \\"There are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial. Not only are the incriminations devastating to the defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect . . . . The unreliability of such evidence is intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice, as here, does not testify and cannot be tested by cross- examination.\\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/391/123/#tab- opinion-1947336 See also *Cruz v.

The film was produced by Shawn Levy and Dan Levine, and stars Amandla Stenberg, Harris Dickinson, Mandy Moore, and Gwendoline Christie, and follows a group of young kids and teenagers who are on the run from the government after mysteriously obtaining superpowers. On September 15, 2014, it was announced that 20th Century Fox had bought the rights to the novel and that Levy would produce the film through his 21 Laps Entertainment. Stenberg was cast two years later on September 26, 2016 and principal photography began in April 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. The film was released in the United States on August 3, 2018, by 20th Century Fox. It received negative reviews from critics, with criticisms towards its acting, direction, screenplay, and \\"lack of personality.\\" The film was a box office bomb, grossing $41.1 million worldwide against its $34 million production budget. Plot In a dystopian future, a contagious disease called Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration kills nearly 98% of all children and teenagers, leaving the survivors with unusual abilities. These survivors with superpowers are imprisoned worldwide. Ruby Daly is an Orange which means she has the psionic ability to get into people's mind. She escapes her prison and joins a resistance group (League) to fight for her future. Cate, a worker at the camp, provides Ruby with a panic button that can be activated as a tracker if she is in danger. When Ruby gets visions while touching Rob, another League member, she becomes suspicious of their intentions. Ruby makes her escape with a mute little girl named Suzume (Zu), a Yellow. Zu takes Ruby to Liam, a Blue, and his friend Charles (Chubs), another Blue (Green in the movie). The three agree to let Ruby join them as they try to make their way to \\"East River,\\" a purported safe haven led by an Orange named Slip Kid. The four enter an abandoned mall to gather supplies, where they cross paths with another group of survivors. The others know where East River is, but the only clue they revealdue to the subtle influence of Ruby's powerare the letters \\"E.D.O.\\" Chubs eventually deduces that this is a radio frequency, which reveals a transmission that East River is in Lake Prince, Virginia. Journeying to East River, Ruby and Liam begin to develop a romantic connection, but Ruby refuses to touch him, fearing that her powers will hurt him. At East River, Slip Kid is revealed to be the president's son, Clancy Gray, who is an Orange. He teaches Ruby how to control her powers, and in return, has Ruby teach him how to erase people's memories. During this process, Clancy controls her mind and kisses her. It is revealed that Clancy is using his powers to control the government, and wants to use his new memory-erasing powers to turn Ruby to his side and forget her friends, but she manages to escape with the others. Liam flees with all of the haven kids, while Ruby faces off against Clancy, destroying the camp and making her escape with Chubs. Chubs is severely injured, leaving Ruby no choice but to use her panic button to call the League for help. The League gets Chubs to a hospital and lets Zu leave with a protective family. Ruby convinces Cate to release Liam in return for taking his place as a soldier in the League. Knowing that Liam will never leave without her, Ruby kisses him and erases all of his memories of her. Liam leaves the camp, while Ruby begins her training with her fellow powered kids in the League. Elsewhere, Clancy looks over his army of government forces. Cast Production On September 15, 2014, it was announced that 20th Century Fox had bought the film rights to Alexandra Bracken's young adult novel The Darkest Minds, the first book in her The Darkest Minds series. Shawn Levy would produce the film along with Dan Levine and Dan Cohen through his 21 Laps Entertainment, while the television writer Chad Hodge was hired to write the adaptation. On July 12, 2016, it was reported that animation director Jennifer Yuh Nelson had been hired to direct the film, and it would be her first live-action project. =Casting= On September 26, 2016, Amandla Stenberg joined the film to play the lead role of Ruby Daly, a 15-year-old girl who runs away from her government camp and joins a group of teens. On January 17, 2017, it was reported that newcomer Harris Dickinson had signed on to play Liam, who also develops superpowers surviving the disease. In February 2017, Miya Cech was cast as Zu in her film debut, and Skylan Brooks was cast as Chubs. In March 2017, Mandy Moore was cast to play Cate, a doctor and member of an organization who is fighting against the government, and Patrick Gibson was cast as Clancy Gray, the president's son, whose posters are all over the camp for being ‚Äúcured‚Äù of his powers. He also has the power of telepathy. Gwendoline Christie was also cast in the film to play a bounty hunter of teens who escape from the camp. In April 2017, Golden Brooks joined the film to play Ruby‚Äôs mother. =Filming= Principal photography on the film began in April 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. =Music= Benjamin Wallfisch composed the score for the film. The soundtrack was released by Milan Records. Reception =Box office= The Darkest Minds has grossed $12.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $28.4 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $41.1 million, against a production budget of $34 million. In the United States and Canada, The Darkest Minds was released on August 3, 2018, alongside Christopher Robin, The Spy Who Dumped Me and Death of a Nation: Can We Save America a Second Time?, and was originally projected to gross around $10 million from 3,127 theaters in its opening weekend. However after grossing $2.3 million on its first day, including $550,000 from Thursday night previews, weekend estimates were lowered to $6 million. It went on to debut $5.8 million, finishing eighth at the box office and marking the 12th worst opening for a film playing in over 3,000 theaters. It dropped 64% to $2.1 million in its second weekend, finishing 12th. In its third weekend, the film grossed $255,173 and was pulled from 2,679 theaters (85.6%, 3,127 to 448), marking the largest third-weekend theater drop in history, beating Live by Nights record of 2,659. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 4.04/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Darkest Minds does little to differentiate itself in a crowded field of YA adaptations, leaving all but the least demanding viewers feeling dystopian d√©j√† vu.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club called the film \\"a formulaic hodgepodge of secondhand plot points\\" and \\"an insult to its target demographic\\" of teen moviegoers. William Bibbiani of TheWrap praised the film and the cast, but concedes \\"it's not quite thrilling enough [...] so it plays a bit more like a manifesto than a sci-fi thriller.\\" Monica Castillo of RogerEbert.com wrote that while the film has a \\"promising start\\", it \\"ultimately doesn‚Äôt quite deliver.\\" Potential sequel While the film is based on the first of four novels, three novellas and three short stories in The Darkest Minds series, and the film‚Äôs ending sets the stage for future action, and director Jennifer Yuh Nelson stated that she would be happy to return for a second film in the series, no definitive plans have been announced, and were reported to be unlikely given the poor box office performance of the film.

She served as President of the Irish Federation of University Teachers (IFUT) from 1989 to 1992. She was appointed the first female Registrar and Deputy President of University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland's largest university, in 1994, and remained in that post until her retirement in 2004. She was Chairperson of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment from 1995 to 2000.  Birth and education  Caroline Hussey was born on 3 December 1941 to Frank and Aileen Hussey. Frank Hussey was lecturer and housemaster at Albert College, the UCD agricultural school in Glasnevin (now DCU), and the family lived on campus for a time. She completed her primary and secondary education at the St. Mary's Holy Faith Convent in Glasnevin. Graduating from UCD in 1962 with a degree in Biochemistry, Hussey went on to complete a PhD at Trinity College Dublin in 1966. She continued her research at TCD and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University. In 1973 she returned to UCD, where she was appointed as lecturer in industrial microbiology.  Academic career  During her time as lecturer in industrial microbiology, Hussey served as a member of the Governing Body of UCD and was also a member of the Senate of the National University of Ireland. She had a particular interest in the area of health and safety. This interest led to the initiation of a Diploma in Health and Safety, a multidisciplinary programme that was taught in a number of Irish Universities. Ultimately, this contributed to the passage of the first Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act in Ireland, in 1989. Using the pseudonym H. J. Forrest, Caroline Hussey published two crime novels, set in south Dublin and on the UCD campus, Publish or Perish (1991) and Murder by the Book (1992). = Senior academic administration = In 1994, Hussey was appointed Registrar and Deputy President of UCD, a position she held until her retirement in 2004. She was known for her rigorous defence of academic standards and addressing quality of teaching at UCD. In 1996, she became chair woman of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment making her, according to a profile in the Irish Times, \\"arguably the second most influential woman in Irish education\\". Niamh Bhreathnach was the Minister for Education at the time, and Caroline Hussey strongly supported her decision to abolish third level fees.  Later life and death  In 2011, Hussey was appointed by the Minister for Education Ruairi Quinn as part of an advisory group to convene the forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Irish primary education sector. The group published their report the following year. She died in Dublin on 11 May 2017 after a short illness.

Neighboring regions include Dishnica to the North, Zagori and K√´lcyra to the West, Kolonja to the East, and the Greek border to the South. It is known for its large and disproportionate contribution of intellectuals to the Albanian National Awakening, including most notably of all Naim Frash√´ri.  History  In the late Ottoman Empire, the region contributed disproportionately to the Albanian National Awakening and the Albanian nationalist movement. Greek schools established in the 19th century helped the emergence of a relatively large (for the times) Albanian literary class. Many important intellectuals such as Naim Frasheri were educated in these schools. The Ottoman authorities tried to ensure that only Christian children would be educated in these schools, but Muslim children attended nevertheless. Both the Ottoman authorities and the Orthodox Church tried to thwart the opening of Albanian-language schools as well, but in the early 20th century as the Ottoman Empire fell apart, these too were opened and Albanian children began attending them, further increasing Albanian literacy. The Albanian literati ultimately ended up contributing very significantly to the Albanian National Awakening, increasing feelings of Albanian patriotism, and facilitated the push for independence from the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th and early 20th century. Another vehicle for propagation of Albanian nationalism were the network of Bektashi tekkes in the region, which tended to support and advocate for the movement. After the fall of communism, the region is very heavily affected by emigration. This also occurred a century ago, when much of the population emigrated to, and then returned from, various places including Istanbul, Romania and the United States.  Population  =Ethnicity= The vast majority of the population is ethnically Albanian, while Aromanians are also present in Frash√´ri and P√´rmet. There is also a small Roma population, and nearby √áarshov√´ (sometimes included) also has both Greek and Aromanian minorities present. =Religion= The Albanian population is divided between Muslims (who are mostly Bektashi) and Christians (who are mostly Orthodox), and it is unclear which faith is larger overall. The Roma population is mostly Muslim, while the Greek population is mostly Orthodox Christian, as is the Aromanian population as well. Many Albanian families are of mixed religious adherence, including the Frasheri family which has both Bektashi Muslim and Orthodox Christian branches. Today as in the rest of Albania, there are many people who don't observe any religion. The region has important sites for both faiths, and is dotted by Orthodox churches and Bektashi teqes built side by side.Nitsiakos.On the Border. Page 186. On September 5, there is a major Bektashi festival for which people travel from other parts of Albania to celebrate, and Bektashis and non-Bektashis alike participate.Nitsiakos. On the Border.

Biography  Sten von Friesen was born in Uppsala in 1907, and his father was the Swedish linguist Otto von Friesen. He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy in 1935 at Uppsala University for his research led by Manne Siegbahn on the measurement of wavelengths in the elements X-ray spectrum. von Friesen moved to the newly established Nobel Institute for Physics in Stockholm in 1937 along Siegbahn. Together they started the construction of Sweden's first cyclotron, but von Friesen was mobilized at the Finnish border after the outbreak of World War II shortly after the completion of the cyclotron. von Friesen became a professor at the Department of Physics at Lund University in 1948, and held the post until his retirement in 1972 when was succeeded by Hans Ryde. As a professor he continued his research on nuclear physics, and he was in charge when Lund University received its first particle accelerator. One of the highlights of his research happened when he and his team could show that the presence of elements in the Milky Way is the same as it is in the distant galaxies. For a wider public, he became known through his participation in the TV program Fr√•ga Lund in the 1960s and 1970s, where he was one of six scientists in the Panel who answered questions from the audience. In addition, he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1964. He is buried at Uppsala Old Cemetery in the same tomb as the father.

It was also released as the B-side of the group's \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" single. It has also appeared on several of the Band's live and compilation albums. Lyrics and music The lyrics of \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" concern a servant who offended the mistress of the house and is being sent away. The singer offers sympathy to the servant. The identity of the singer is ambiguous. According to Jason Schneider, the singer is a \\"conscientious friend coming to the aid\\" of the former servant but according to Nick DeRiso it could be a \\"master bidding goodbye to his hand maiden after an embarrassing affair is revealed.\\" As with other songs on The Band, the characters seems to be from the Southern United States. Music critic Barney Hoskyns described the setting as a Southern household from a Tennessee Williams play. David Hatch and Stephen Millward describe the prevailing emotion as being one of \\"regret rather than incrimination.\\" Robertson stated in 1971 that \\"To write a song about this kind of thing is not really a very righteous thing to do, because we're at the point now where there should be no differences between people. Everybody is now so interested in being the same, so I was kinda playing a game in writing this song.\\" According to The Band FAQ author Peter Aaron, the song uses an \\"odd, descending chord progression\\" that is more like jazz than the Band's other music. Hoskyns similarly acknowledges that the song is unlike most rock 'n' roll. Jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason stated that the song sounds like could have been written by jazz pianist Bill Evans. Aaron also states that the song may have been influenced by England's ballad tradition. Bassist Rick Danko sings the lead vocal, which Hoskyns praises for its \\"mixture of bashfulness and regret.\\" DeRiso says it is \\"as observant, and maybe more interesting\\" than Danko's vocal performance on \\"It Makes No Difference,\\" which is often regarded as Danko's best. The instrumentation starts with Robertson on acoustic guitar, Levon Helm on drums and Richard Manuel on piano. DeRiso argues that Manuel's piano and Robertson's guitar work in opposition to each other, with Manuel's piano part sounding \\"ruminitive\\" and Robertson's guitar sounding like it is \\"determined\\" with a sense of duty, and that this opposition adds to the complexity of the song. During the second verse, Garth Hudson adds his soprano saxophone and producer John Simon kicks in on tuba, and DeRiso describes their effect as enriching the song's emotion \\"by a series of mournful moans.\\" The song is unusual for the Band in that it contains two instrumental solos, a guitar solo by Robertson and a saxophone solo by Hudson, both of which Aaron describes as \\"tender.\\" Writing and recording Robertson wrote \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" in Hawaii on a trip he took with Simon shortly before The Band was to be recorded. The released version of the song uses the vocal Danko recorded on the first take. He recalls recording the vocal 30 or 40 more times before they decided to just use the first. According to producer Simon, the \\"moaning\\" horn sound that elicited favorable commentary was not done intentionally but rather came about because those were the only sounds he and Hudson were able to make. Reception Aaron rates \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" as one of the Band's greatest songs. Band biographer Cliff Harris claims that \\"in the space of four minutes and seventeen seconds\\" the song \\"presented a story worthy of Faulkner or Hemingway. DeRiso calls it \\"a wonder of heart- rending honesty.\\" C. Michael Bailey wrote in the April 2012 issue of All about Jazz that \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" and \\"The Weight\\" represented the Biblical American archetype \\"perhaps better than any other place in popular music.\\" Nicholas Oliver wrote in The Rough Guide to Rock that the \\"compelling narratives\\" of \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" as well as \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\" and \\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come),\\" represent Robertson's \\"creative peak.\\" In his autobiography, Elvis Costello identified \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" as his favorite song. George Harrison biographer Simon Leng identifies the Band's first two albums as significant influences on Harrison's solo song writing, and particularly identifies \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" as an influence. Leng identifies a number of elements that showed up in many of Harrison's solo efforts, including \\"the medium tempo, the tension of the second theme...the eccentric chord structure\\" as well as passionate singing that seems to be barely within the singer's range, and the \\"sweet and sour horn arrangement.\\" Leng also notes that the guitar playing style and \\"reverent\\" mood of the song were similar to Harrison's subsequent songs. \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" has been included on several of The Band's compilation albums. These have included To Kingdom Come: The Definitive Collection in 1989, Across the Great Divide in 1994 and A Musical History in 2005.

Hoskyns says this is because it \\"was not only a perfect showcase for Rick [Danko] as a ballad singer but featured a spine-tingling Robertson solo utilizing his remarkable 'trilling' technique and harmonics.\\" The song was recorded live during the performances at the Academy of Music in New York City in late 1971, a selection of which were released on the live album Rock of Ages. Allen Toussaint charted additional horn parts for these performances, and these parts were played by such luminaries as Snooky Young, Howard Johnson, Joe Farrell, and well as Earl McIntyre on trombone and J.D. Parron on alto saxophone. Hoskyns particularly praised Farrell's soprano saxophone fills. Although some of these musicians had played with the likes of Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Ray Charles, Elvin Jones and Charles Mingus, Garth Hudson still played his saxophone solo himself. Robertson's guitar playing also attracted attention. For the live performances Robertson plays electric guitar rather than the acoustic guitar he played on The Band version. DeRiso says that as a result Robertson's guitar \\"even more completely inhabits the steely sense of duty that drives the narrator. In Hoskyns' opinion the guitar solo on Rock of Ages could be one of the ten greatest ever recorded. DeRiso also praises Danko's vocal performance for capturing how unbearable it is to the narrator that his beloved servant is leaving. Gleason similarly concludes that this is \\"an unusually warm, moving version of this exquisite song and is the best vocal Rick contributes, possibly the best he's done.\\" Other live albums containing \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" include Live at the Academy of Music 1971 from the shows on which Rock of Ages was based, released in 2013, and The Night They Drove Old Dixie Town: Radio Broadcast 1970, released in 2016.

The group is noted for helping influencing the powerviolence movement and for their bleak lyrics about topics such as gang violence, misanthropy, and self-hate. The band was known for being mysterious during their initial run; they often used pseudonyms in their liner notes and they never played live shows until their reformation in 2007. They've been described as \\"the angriest band in the world\\" by some. Biography Guitarist Phil Vera first met vocalist/guitarist Chris Elder back when they hosted an underground death metal/black metal-themed radio show called \\"Hour of the Goat\\" on KXLU from 1992-1994. The duo would then recruit bassist and vocalist Lulu Hernandez as well as drummer Rob Alaniz. Hernandez was only 16 when she joined the band. From 1995 to 1996, the group issued a few split 7\\" and compilation tracks through labels such as Pessimiser (which Elder owned and operated) and Slap-a-Ham before quietly breaking up in 1996. During their initial run, the group had a revolving door of members that included guitarist Jerry Flores from Excruciating Terror, drummer Martin Alvarado, and bassist Frankie Knuckles from Stapled Shut and Nausea (Los Angeles). In 2007, the band reunited to perform their first ever live show. Hernandez did not join for the reunion, so to fill in her place the band recruited vocalist Cynthia Nishi and bassist Chris Dodge, operator of Slap-a-Ham and former member of Spazz. In 2011, the group released the split album And on and On... with Agoraphobic Nosebleed, which was issued through Relapse Records. The split included the first material written by the band since their reformation. In 2014, Dodge left the group to focus more on his family.

On 2 September 1944, a platoon of Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) fighters ambushed a government water supply column outside Chortiatis village. Several hours later an Axis penal expedition into the area led to the destruction of the village and the parallel execution of 146 of its citizens, most of whom were women and children. Background On 28 October 1940, Italy began the Italo-Greek War, expecting a swift victory but the invasion failed and the Italians were pushed back into Albania. As the war dragged on into its sixth month, Germany was forced to intervene to support its struggling ally. The small Greek force defending the Greco‚ÄìBulgarian border was defeated by the better-equipped and numerically- superior Germans. The German penetration deep into Greece made further resistance at the Albanian front pointless, ending the Battle of Greece in the favor of the Axis Powers. The British conducted an evacuation and Greece was subjected to a Triple Occupation by Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. Soon, Resistance groups began being formed, and by 1942, the communist-led Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), became the dominant resistance organization in the country. Right-wing resistance organizations such as the National Republican Greek League (EDES), National and Social Liberation (EKKA) and Defenders of Northern Greece (YBE) played a much smaller role. Operation Steinadler (3‚Äì13 July 1944) was the last counter-insurgency operation carried out by German forces in Macedonia. Although wide in its scope it ultimately failed to achieve its objectives as ELAS fighters successfully evaded the German patrols, returning to their hideouts once the operation was over. The civilian population thus became the main target for Axis reprisals. Shortly afterwards the German 1st Mountain Division and the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division departed from the country, while in August Army Group E declared Greece a war zone. German shops and cultural institutions were closed, while civilians and older member of the army, secret police and SS were evacuated. Under Adolf Hitler's orders the Wehrmacht adopted the policy of total war, in response to the rise of ELAS subversive activity which had hampered the summer harvest in areas still controlled by the collaborationist government. Army Group E's staff deemed the preceding Distomo massacre and 1 May 1944 Kaisariani executions as excessive and even damaging to the image of the occupational authorities. The staff stressed the need to arrest insurgents rather than resorting to the collective punishment of civilians. Nevertheless, those orders were disregarded and atrocities continued unhindered. Between June and August, ELAS attacks led to the death of 30 German soldiers, 14 were wounded and 9 more were missing in action. German reprisals in their turn included the execution of 254 people. German occupational authorities further attempted to instill terror in the population of western Macedonia by deploying the collaborationist Poulos Verband and Jagdkommando Schubert, headed by Georgios Poulos and Friedrich Schubert respectively. These units were stationed in Krya Vrysi and Asvestochori, creating a protective axis around Thessaloniki, while Thessaloniki itself was garrisoned by the collaborationist government's Security Battalions. Schubert's previous imprisonment by the Germans, who condemned his ruthlessness and employment of former convicts during his deployment in Crete, was now disregarded, as all available forces were required for the Axis counter insurgency campaign. The pressure from the ELAS attacks around Thessaloniki threatened the ongoing German evacuation of southern Greece; Army Group E came to the conclusion that a show of force was necessary. Massacre Location of Chortiatis. On 2 September, a platoon of ELAS fighters ambushed a government water supply column outside Chortiatis, killing a single driver and gravely injuring his passenger. Half an hour later a second car came under fire on the same location. One German soldier was wounded and taken prisoner along with two Greek workers, whilst the Greek driver and a second soldier managed to flee to Asvestochori. When the denizens of Chortiatis expressed their fears regarding a potential German reprisal towards Antonis Kazakos (the head of the ELAS platoon), he appeared dismissive, exclaiming \\"This area is part of a free Greece. No German will dare to step his foot into this land\\". Shortly afterwards a Wehrmacht patrol spotted a burning car outside Chortiatis, confirming that an attack had taken place. Kazakos convinced the civilian population of Chortiatis to remain in place, but unbeknownst to him 20 cars loaded with German and Schubert's soldiers were already on their way towards the village. The ELAS band and its captives departed to Livadi, whilst the local men left the village for the surrounding fields even earlier. Upon surrounding the village, the Germans assembled the remaining women and children at the village square, while a second group was taken to the local cafe. When the village mayor Christos Batatsiou attempted to beg the Germans for mercy he was stabbed with a knife by Schubert and taken away by his men, who proceeded to loot and burn 300 houses. The women and children from the square were then forced into the house of Evangelos Davoudis where they were burned alive, only two of them managing to survive. Schubert's men led the second group of civilians into the bakery of Stefanos Gouramanis while one of them played a violin and others sung cheerfully. A machine gun was placed in one of the bakery's windows, gunning down those standing inside. Eight children managed to escape the carnage by climbing out of a small window in the back of the building. Afterwards the collaborationists placed grass on the corpses and set them aflame with a flare gun. Several survivors tried to make an escape but they were stabbed and pushed back by Schubert's men, only one man and one woman absconded through the smoke when they were distracted by the village priest. Five women managed to evade death by claiming that their relatives served in the Security Battalions. Eleven civilians were captured and executed in the vicinity of the village, among them one woman was raped. Aftermath The number of casualties totaled 146 people, including 109 women and 37 men ranging from the age of two months to 81 years. 34 were burned alive in the Davoudis house, 76 were killed in the bakery, 34 were shot or stabbed in their homes or outside the village. Following the destruction of Chortiatis, the Axis forces returned to their bases in Asvestochori and Thessaloniki. Fearing the return of the penal expedition and repulsed by the smell emanating from the corpses, the surviving inhabitants of Chortiatis hid in the surrounding forest. Two days later Schubert's men returned to the village to strip it of what little they had left on their previous visit. The Chortiatis massacre was not mentioned in any form in the contemporary German documents. Similarly, during course of the Nuremberg trials, then chief of staff of Army Group E Wilhelm Hammer, only referred to the ambush preceding the massacre. None of the Germans responsible for the massacre were ever convicted of their crimes. Many of them continued to advance their careers in the years that followed the war: Army Group E intelligence officer Kurt Waldheim later became the ninth President of Austria. Schubert on the other hand was arrested in the aftermath of the war, tried and executed in Athens.

Recorded primarily at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California, it was produced by vocalist and guitarist Chad I Ginsburg and released on June 16, 2017 as the group's first album on Entertainment One Music. The album was the band's first to be recorded following the departure of original frontman Deron Miller, who left in 2011, and the last to feature bassist Matt Deis, who returned in 2015. Following Miller's departure in 2011, CKY performed a number of shows in 2012 with new frontman Daniel Davies. The new lineup recorded a number of tracks for a planned album, but other commitments saw Davies leave the group and Ginsburg take over as lead vocalist. Deis rejoined the band in 2015, before the new-look trio recorded The Phoenix in 2016. \\"Days of Self Destruction\\", \\"Replaceable\\" and \\"Head for a Breakdown\\" were issued as singles prior to the album. Recording and production Following the departure of original CKY frontman Deron Miller in 2011, the band began working on an album with his replacement Daniel Davies. However, due to other commitments (primarily a tour with John Carpenter) the material was scrapped and the band started again with guitarist Chad I Ginsburg on lead vocals. Speaking with former Jackass crew member Rick Kosick in March 2017, CKY drummer Jess Margera noted that the band considered putting \\"one or two\\" of the songs written with Davies on the album, but then decided to start over after his departure. Referring to the tracks, Margera suggested that \\"Maybe one day we can revisit some of that stuff and give it a different name, because it was killer material in my opinion. Never say never.\\" The drummer reflected on the situation positively, suggesting that it \\"couldn't have worked out any better, because it sort of forced Chad to step up to the vocal mic, which is where that guy needs to be\\". It was first revealed that CKY was recording new material in January 2016, when Margera posted a photo of Abbey Road Studios in London, England on his Instagram account with the caption \\"Me Chad and Matt Deis. Recording some new CKY next month. Abbey fucking Road. That is all.\\" When asked by a fan in the comments about who would be performing lead vocals since Miller's departure, the drummer confirmed that Ginsburg would be taking over the role. No further updates were provided on the planned sessions, and in May it was announced that CKY would be recording at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California in July for a planned release before the end of the year. The announcement also confirmed that Ginsburg was the band's new lead vocalist. Ginsburg produced the album and later mixed it at Studio 4 Recording in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, where previous album Carver City had been mixed in 2009 with Phil Nicolo. Composition and lyrics CKY frontman Chad I Ginsburg describes The Phoenix as a stylistic follow-up to the band's 2002 second studio album Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild. Speaking to Canadian newspaper The Seeker, he claimed that the album \\"picks up where, Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild ... left off\\", hailing it as the band's \\"crowning achievement\\". In a feature for Alternative Press upon the release of the album's lead single \\"Days of Self Destruction\\", Ginsburg went as far as to suggest that fans could \\"ignore the other two records\\" after the 2002 release, 2005's An Answer Can Be Found and 2009's Carver City, dubbing The Phoenix the direct follow-up to Infiltrate‚Ä¢Destroy‚Ä¢Rebuild. Promotion and release In March 2017, it was announced that CKY had signed a worldwide record deal with Entertainment One Music, with the band's first album on the label scheduled for a summer release. On April 30, 2017, on the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show with Daniel P. Carter, the album was officially announced and \\"Days of Self Destruction\\", featuring Brent Hinds of Mastodon, was premiered as the first single. The track was released as a digital download the following day, along with a music video filmed during the album's recording sessions at Rancho De La Luna. \\"Replaceable\\" was debuted as the second single from the album on the Loudwire website on June 2, 2017. Speaking about the track, Ginsburg described it as being \\"generally about anyone that gets in your way, holds you back or slows your potential with their own blatant insecurity, fears or sickness ‚Äî individuals who you are ultimately and knowingly covering for as they selfishly sabotage you\\". Four days before the album's release, \\"Head for a Breakdown\\" was made available for streaming on the Consequence of Sound website. Ginsburg described the track as \\"a song about taking things too far when you darn right know it won't end well but you do it anyway\\". Critical reception Reviewing the album for Alternative Press, Aaron Burgess praised frontman Chad I Ginsburg's performance as lead vocalist on The Phoenix, noting that he \\"slides perfectly into the singer role, spitting venom through The Phoenix's 10 kiss-off anthems\\", and highlighted the track \\"Wiping Off the Dead\\". Burgess welcomed the return of \\"The inimitably fuzzed-out CKY guitar tone remains [and] the roller-disco grooves\\", but suggested that \\"the vibe feels more traditionally hard-rock than tradition-shattering\\", which he dubbed as \\"not quite CKY as usual\\". AllMusic's James Christopher Monger proposed that The Phoenix features \\"a sleek and sordid set of swaggering disco-post-grunge emissions that fall well within the established CKY sonic parameters\\", highlighting the tracks \\"Replaceable\\", \\"Unknown Enemy\\" and \\"Better Than Get Even\\". Blabbermouth.net's Ray Van Horn, Jr. hailed the album as a progression from Carver City, praising it for \\"entertaining instead of challenging fans\\".

In particular, Reardon has conducted extensive research on segregation in the United States, e.g. between ethnic groups, socioeconomic groups, and in terms of school locations. For example, together with Gary Orfield, Sara Schley and Diane Glass, Reardon observes that Afro-American and Hispanic students are much more likely than White students to find themselves in schools of concentrated poverty.Orfield, G. et al. (1994). The growth of segregation in American schools: Changing patterns of separation and poverty since 1968. Equity & Excellence in Education, 27(1), pp. 5-8. He further finds that segregation between non-Hispanic white students and all other students has increased, on average, while segregation among black, Hispanic and Asian student groups has decreased, with the overall change being mostly attributable to growth in between-district segregation as segregation within districts has decreased.Reardon, S.F., Yun, J.T., Eitle, T.M.N. (2000). The changing structure of school segregation: Measurement and evidence of multiracial metropolitan-area school segregation, 1989-1995. Demography, 37(3), pp. 351-364. Studying the trajectory of racial school segregation in the wake of Brown vs. Board of Education, Reardon finds that segregation gradually increased following release from court order, relative to the trends in segregation in districts remaining under court order, with the increases being more pronounced in the South, in elementary grades, and in districts where prereleease school segregation levels were low; this suggests that court-ordered desegregation plans are effective in reducing racial school segregation but see their effects fade over time without continued court oversight.Reardon, S.F. et al. (2012). Brown fades: The end of court-ordered school desegregation and the resegregation of American public schools. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 31(4), pp. 876-904. Methodologically, Reardon (with Glenn Firebaugh) has argued that information theory indices are better measures of multigroup segregation than indices of dissimilarity, Gini, squared coefficient of variation, relative diversity or normalized exposure, as they alone accord with the principle of transfers and can be decomposed into inter- and intra-group effects.Reardon, S.F., Firebaugh, G. (2002). Measures of multigroup segregation. Sociological Methodology, 32(1), pp. 33-67. Another major topic in Reardon's research concerns spatial segregation between ethnic and socioeconomic groups. In terms of methodology, Reardon and O'Sullivan have argued that spatial information theory indices - i.e. measures of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual - and spatial exposure/isolation indices - i.e. measures of the average composition of individuals' local spatial environments - are better measures of spatial segregation than indices of spatial relative diversity and spatial dissimilarity.Reardon, S.F., O'Sullivan, D. (2004). Measures of spatial segregation. Sociological Methodology, 34(1), pp. 121-162. Moreover, Reardon's research on spatial segregation has repeatedly emphasized the issue of geographic scale, i.e. while some groups are segregated over regions, other groups are mainly segregated across neighbourhoods or even within neighbourhoods.Reardon, S.F. et al. (2008). The geographic scale of metropolitan racial segregation. Demography, 45(3), pp. 489-514. With regard to racial segregation in the United States, Reardon, Barnett Lee and others find that segregation between Blacks and Whites is mainly due to segregation between metropolitan districts rather than to segregation within neighbourhoods, though the latter is the main driver of Hispanic-White and Asian-White segregation.Lee, B.A. et al. (2008). Beyond the census tract: Patterns and determinants of racial segregation at multiple geographic scales. American Sociological Review, 73(5), pp. 766-791. Concerning segregation by income groups, Reardon and Kendra Bischoff observe that - especially for Afro- American families - income inequality increases income segregation, as inequality spurs the large-scale segregation of rich people rather than it segregates poor people or affects small-scale patterns of income segregation.Reardon, S.F., Bischoff, K. (2011). Income inequality and income segregation. American Journal of Sociology, 116(4), pp. 1092-1153. Finally, Reardon has also studied educational inequality in the United States. For example, he finds (with Galindo) that Hispanic children in general and Mexican and Central American children in particular enter kindergarten with an - on average - much lower reading and math aptitude than their non-Hispanic white children, though the gaps in both subjects narrow by about a third within the two first years of elementary school but remain stable afterwards.Reardon, S.F., Galindo, C. (2009). The Hispanic-White achievement gap in math and reading in the elementary grades. American Educational Research Journal, 46(3), pp. 853-891. Moreover, in research on the historical trajectory of educational inequality, Reardon finds that the gap between the educational achievements of children from families in the 10th richest percentile of the income distribution and those from the 10th poorest percentile increased by 30-40% between 1976 and 2001, is now twice as large as the black-white achievement gap, is already large when children enter kindergarten, is driven mainly by a closer correlation between family income and children's academic achievement in families with incomes over the median and not by growing income inequality or a stronger influence of parents' education.Reardon, S.F. (2011). The widening academic achievement gap between the rich and the poor: New evidence and possible explanations. In: Duncan, G.J., Murnane, R.J. (eds.). Whither Opportunity? Rising Inequality, Schools, and Children's Life Chances.. New York City: Russell Sage Foundation, pp. 91-116.Reardon, S.F. (2013). The widening income achievement gap.

It serves as a prequel to his 2013 debut horror film Lord of Tears. The film is set during the 1940s and tells the story of a psychologist that soon finds himself at odds with the Owlman, a sinister owl- headed figure. Plot Finn Galloway is a psychologist that has become obsessed with one of his patients, a young woman who had been terrified of a sinister owl-headed entity called the Owlman. His investigations bear little fruit until he learns of a former ballerina named Elisa Grey, who has sequestered herself at the Baldurrock Estate with only her guardian Lorena Velasco for company. Finn discovers that Elisa suffers from identical fears, which prompts him to begin treating her in hopes of uncovering the truth - only to find that this will likely bring him face to face with the terrifying Owlman.

The episode was written by showrunner Andrew Dabb and directed by Robert Singer. It was first broadcast on January 26, 2017, on The CW. In the episode, Sam and Dean are placed on a black site after \\"attempting to assassinate\\" the President and begin to look for a way to get out of their jails. Meanwhile, Mary and Castiel work together in order to save them from the government. The episode received generally positive reviews although critics wondered what would be the direction of the season. Plot Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) are taken to a government black site in the Rocky Mountain National Park, where they are locked in separate cells until they are willing to talk. After nearly two months, they are found dead by the guards, but suddenly revive and escape. At the same time, Mary (Samantha Smith) and Castiel (Misha Collins) attempt to find them without luck. With the Winchesters gone, monster activity goes on the rise and Castiel begins to see just how important his friends are. After escaping, the Winchesters contact Castiel to meet them when they get out of the forest and go on the run from government soldiers. Sam and Dean are able to defeat the soldiers, then reunite with Castiel and Mary, who have found them with the help of Mick (Adam Fergus) and Arthur (David Haydn-Jones). Driving away, they are stopped by Billie (Lisa Berry) and it is revealed that the Winchesters made a deal with her in which they would temporarily die and come back in exchange for a Winchester dying permanently at midnight or face cosmic consequences. Mary chooses to sacrifice herself for her sons, but Castiel kills Billie instead, telling the horrified Winchesters that they are all too important for the world to lose. At the same time, Mick unsuccessfully attempts to make connections with the American hunters. However, when Mick approaches Mary, she is shown to be more open to listening since he helped rescue Sam and Dean, though she is unaware that Mick had Arthur killed everyone at the black site so as to leave no \\"loose ends\\". Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.72 million viewers with a 0.6/2 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.73 million viewers with a 0.6/2 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 0.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 2 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Supernatural ranked as the most watched program on The CW in the day, beating Riverdale. =Critical reviews= \\"First Blood\\" received generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict: \\"With 'First Blood,' the show sort of decided that Sam and Dean were finally in a bind that Cas, Mary, and Crowley couldn't touch. Not that Crowley would, but specifically, and conveniently, his contacts were useless here. So the boys got to sit alone for over a month and then decide that that was so bad that one of them should die. What worked here was the idea of Sam and Dean's criminal past finally catching up with them. Their reputations as Heartland boogeymen put them in a tough spot. The problem was, it never felt quite tough enough given everything else these guys have faced over twelve seasons.\\" Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 3 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"I was expecting a lot more from this episode, especially for a midseason premiere. I'm interested to see how things play out going forward with respect to killing Billie, but it felt like such a roundabout and unnecessary way to get there with the whole prison and then escape. If anything, at least Sam and Dean are back and ready to get into the next case. After all, they're the guys who saved the world.\\" Samantha Highfill from EW gave the episode a \\"A-\\" and wrote, \\"Altogether, this hour was once again something different for the show. The way the action unfolded felt more like a mini action movie than an episode of Supernatural, and it worked. Yes, we're used to seeing the Winchesters fight on this show, but this time, they weren't facing ghosts. They were facing real, trained soldiers. They're always badass, but this was a new level.

It has been reprinted several times in the 21st century. Lilith, The Legend of the First Woman is a 19th- century rendition of the old rabbinical legend of Lilith, the first woman, whose life story was dropped unrecorded from the early world, and whose home, hope, and Eden were passed to another woman. The author warns us in her preface that she has not followed the legend closely. In her hands, Lilith becomes an embodiment of mother-love that existed forever, and it is her name that lends its itself to the lullabys repeated to young children. Literary basis Collier not only freely changes the legend of Lilith, but is free with the unities of her own story. It is full of internal inconsistencies in narrative, and anachronisms. The legend (doubtless made to reconcile the two accounts in the Book of Genesis of the creation of woman, the first of which represents her made with man, and by implication, coequal; and the other as created second and subordinate), is to the effect that God first created Adam and Lilith, equal in authority; that the clashing this led to was so great, that Lilith was cast out from Eden, and the marital experiment tried again, on a different principle, by the creation of Eve. Lilith thereafter wedded Eblis, the prince of devils, and became the mother of demons and specters; and in vengeance upon her rival, Eve, the mother of mankind, became the special enemy of babies, whom she strangles with a thread of her golden hair. The obvious injustice to Lilith‚Äî who seems to have asked no more than her fair half, while Adam was the encroacher, on the assumption that they were created equal ‚Äîinspired Collier's version of the legend, according to which Lilith leaves Eden voluntarily, rather than submit to dominance, but loses thereby the blessing of motherhood. This alone, not either Adam or Eden, she envies Eve, and at last steals the coveted first human baby, which dies, bereft of its mother, and so gives Lilith the reputation in legend of being a child- murderess. When Collier discovered that the word \\"lullaby\\" (Lilla, abi‚Äîbegone, Lilith!) denoted the songs which mothers soothed their babies, she adapted Lilith's acquired modern meaning, wholly removed from its original signification, into this poem. It enabled Collier to evolve the idea that Lilith, instead of being a fiend, was really a creature of strong maternal instincts and it is in this character that Lilith was presented. Plot Created Adam's equal alike in stature, strength and power, Lilith's spirit is chafed by Adam's insistence on his own supremacy and her subjection, and rather than yield she chooses to find her own paradise without the walls. > :\\"In goodly Eden, Adam, safely bide, :But I. for peace, nor love, nor life,\\" > she cried, :\\"Submit to thee.\\" According to Collier's narrative, Lilith, having left the Garden of Eden, never to return, goes out into the world. For a time, she enjoys the pleasure in Nature's companionship. Far from Eden, she finds a beautiful land where she can rule supreme, though lonely. It is here that she is wooed by Eblis, the fallen angel and prince of the powers of the air, who forgets to mourn the heaven he lost in the heaven of Lilith's love. > :Unheeded, swiftly passed them o'er‚Äî :Glad summer days -till one hour softly > laid :At Lilith's feet a fair lone babe that strayed :From distant Dreamland > far. So might one deem :That looked upon its fuce: or; it might seem :From > other climes a rose leaf blown apart. :Down drifted there to gladden > Lilith's heart. Eblis woos Lilith and she becomes his wife. Lilith's children are little imps without affection for her or her maternal yearnings; in fact, they torture her. When Lilith starts thinking about Eden, Eblis takes her there and, upon looking over its wall, she is annoyed to see Adam with another wife, Eve, who is breastfeeding. Lilith's discovery that she has been supplanted and that Eve's child loves its mother, arouses jealousy and later, Lilith steals the baby, devoting all her affectionate and attention to it, but the child subsequently grows ill. After Adam and Eve are driven from the Garden, Lilith relents and takes the child back to its mother, in whose arms it afterwards dies, and Lilith returns to her own land. > :::::There looking on the sea. :Low-voiced, she sang. So sweet the idle > song, :She said: \\"From Paradise, forgotten long, :It comes. An elfin echo > that doth rise :Upward from summer seas to bending skies. :In coming days, > from any earthly shore :It shall not fail. And sweet forever more :Shall > make my memory. That witching strain :Pale Lilith's love shall lightly > breathe again. :And Lilith's bitter loss and olden pain :O'er every cradle > wake that sweet refrain. :My memory still shall bloom. It cannot die :While > rings Earth's, cradle-song-‚Äîsweet lullaby.\\" Criticism Wakeman stated that Lilith is described as a graceful creation, but the effect of her appearance might have been enhanced if Eblis had been pictured darker in character. Eve is described as love and tenderness, while Adam's characteristics are not strongly marked. The poem has many beautiful, descriptive passages. It is generally smooth in its metrical expression, employing iambics. Kerr critiqued that while the story's verse was unequaled, the poem lacks sustained power. A certain looseness in the construction of sentences implies that the work didn't undergo much revision. In a third review it is said that while Collier's descriptive powers were analytical and microscopic, there is a sameness which results in too often exhibiting one picture in different lights.

History Task Force 157, during the time of its operations, was the United States military's only network of undercover agents that operated abroad using business cover for their operations. The major functions and duties of Task Force 157 involved Soviet vessel movement and nuclear weapon shipments around the world. It also recruited foreign intelligence service agents to infiltrate their respective foreign agencies. The majority of its operating areas are declassified, including, Europe and the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific and the Far East; however, some of the operations are still classified. Task Force 157 was valuable to the United States government because it was able to operate independently, with accuracy, swiftness and extreme secrecy. The Pentagon found it difficult to maintain control over the agents involved with Task Force 157, and because of this reason, it was disestablished in 1977. The United States government wanted to pursue a clandestine operation unit that was more manageable, but at the same time was able to carry out operations at the same standard as Task Force 157. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) failed to fully absorb the missions and agents from Task Force 157; instead, they were spread among the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Army, Air Force, and Task Force 168. In 1981, the United States Army created the Intelligence Support Activity (ISA) to conduct clandestine operations, and to support military operations. In 1989, only eight years after ISA was established, the United States military terminated the unit and established the USSOCOM. Achievements A 1973 declassified activity update outlined the achievements of Task Force 157 from its creation date, to 1973. It was reported that the covert unit issued over 8,000 intelligence reports, with the information being classified as great or moderate value. The human source intelligence report lists the following statistics based on analyst evaluations of one-quarter of the intelligence reports: * 72% of the reports were of great or moderate value * 93% of the reports contained intelligence that was being reported for the first time * 87% of the reports contained valid information That same year, Task Force 157 identified two crucial choke points in Europe in regards to Soviet warship and merchant vessel movements. During this time, the unit recorded over 20,000 ships, while producing over 40,000 pictures of those ships. This intelligence collection allowed the United States government to have a better understanding of Soviet intentions and relations in Europe and the Arab Nations. During this time, Task Force 157 was able to collect intercepted communications, then translate and report them to the proper agencies. Another major achievement that was reported in the human source intelligence report summarized Iraqi and Soviet naval activities in the Persian Gulf in relation to seaborne arms shipments. In 1974, a similar declassified activity update explained that production from Task Force 157 had \\"increased dramatically\\" over the last four years (1970-1974). Operations during this time had foci in the Leningrad area, Black Sea Ports, Kola Inlet and Soviet involved in the Far East. Members of Task Force 157 were able to enter China and North Korea \\"nearly 100 times\\". The purpose of these missions was to collect information, pictures, and any other products of collection of Communist China and North Korean ship construction and naval order of battle. A new Chinese missile-equipped patrol boat was discovered, photographed, and confirmed. Task Force 157 agents were also able to confirm the first North Korean guided missile boat constructed entirely in North Korea. Don Nielsen, the commander of Task Force 157, wrote a memo to the Director of Naval Intelligence (DNI) in 1975 to dissuade him from dissolving Task Force 157. The purpose of this memo was to offer a solution to the decision to dissolve Task Force 157, and to ensure that the DNI was in full possession of the facts. Nielsen explains that he is in shock that the DNI considered disestablishing the leader in Defense clandestine collection. He also explains that cutting Task Force 157 from the Navy will remove any chances of creating a similar task force in the future. Nielsen describes the units actions as irreplaceable because of the unique methods of collection by unconventional means. Task Force 157 was able to avoid traditional government elicitation techniques by relying on commercial and business operations. Nielsen also highlights the amount of resources, projects, and manpower that would have to be transferred to other portions of the Navy, consistently stating that the reallocation of assets would be more wasteful.

Early life and education Fiske was born June 11, 1883 at Fort Bennett in Dakota Territory, son of George E. Fiske, a soldier at the post, and of Louise, n√©e Otter. The elder Fiske originally hailed from Baltimore MD, had been trained as an artist working as a set painter in theatres, spending some time at sea traveling multiple times to South America and enlisting in the early 1870s into the US military, first getting posted to Arizona Territory and later to Fort Sully and Fort Bennett in Dakota Territory. Soon after Frank's birth, his father resigned from the military to take up ranching on a claim approx. 60 miles north of Pierre. By 1888, on account of the persisting drought, the Fiskes gave up ranching and removed to Fort Yates, North Dakota on Standing Rock Indian Reservation, where the elder Fiske found work as a wagon master. Frank attended school at Fort Yates and the local boarding school with Indian children between 1890 and 1900.\\"Which Chosen People? Manifest Destiny meets the Sioux.

Fansler, the post photographer at Fort Yates. When Fansler abandoned the studio in 1900, Fiske took over, aged 17, following into the footsteps of his illustrious predecessors, the legendary photographers Orlando Scott Goff and David Francis Barry. He continued to operate his studio, primarily at Fort Yates, until his death in 1952. Around the same time at the turn of the century, Frank's parents moved to a ranch near Fort Rice. Having grown up among the Lakota people of Standing Rock Indian Reservation Frank developed a great interest and admiration about the Sioux nation, their history and culture documenting many aspects of their lives through his photography. He was fascinated listening to the stories of the old warriors. In 1917 he published his first book \\"The Taming of the Sioux\\".\\"The Taming of the Sioux\\", by Frank Bennett Fiske, 1917, Bismarck Tribune, Bismarck ND https://archive.org/details/tamingofsioux02fisk In 1918 Fiske enlisted in the army and briefly served in World War I, albeit he was not sent overseas. The following year, on his birthday he married Angela Cournoyer, a direct descendant of chief Forked Horn and fur trader Joseph Picotte. In 1921, their only daughter Francine was born. In 1933 Fiske published his second book, \\"Life and Death of Sitting Bull\\". Among Fiske's photographs is one of Red Tomahawk, Sitting Bull‚Äôs assassin, which later was reproduced and now is on North Dakota highway markers. Later life In 1950 Fiske received the North Dakota Art Award for his lifetime achievement as a photographer, earning recognition for his Indian portraits by the State American Art Week Committee.

Ferrocene offers many advantages over pure hydrocarbons when used as a building block of macromolecular chemistry. The variety of possible substitutions at the ferrocene parent body results in a multitude of accessible polymers with interesting electronic and photonic properties. Many polyferrocenes are relatively easily accessible. Poly(1,1'-ferrocene-silane) can be prepared by ring-opening polymerization and has a variety of interesting properties, such as a high refractive index or semiconductor properties. Ring-opening polymerization usually leads to polymers containing ferrocene in the backbone. Besides the latter motif, ferrocene can be attached to the backbone as pendant unit as well.Rudolf Pietschnig: Polymers with pendant ferrocenes. In: Chemical Society Reviews. 45, 2016, S. 5216, . Biferrocene is the smallest unit of polyferrocene.  Potential applications  Polyferrocenes currently have no commercial applications, despite being the subject of research for nearly 50 years. Polyvinylferrocene gives electroactive films that have been investigated as glucose sensors. = Coatings = Satellites charge themselves by the bombardment with charged particles of the solar wind. Charging can lead to an arc discharge which can impair the function of the satellite due to magnetic disturbances and material failure. To avoid these impairments, coatings of electrically weak or non-conductive plastic components of thin films of poly(1,1'-ferrocen-silane) were examined. These carry off the charge generated by the irradiation and thus could protect the satellite from overloads. R. Resendes, A. Berenbaum, G. Stojevic, F. J√§kle, A. Bartole, F. Zamanian, I.

It is about 8 degrees south of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. The nebula is bubble-like (hence its common name, the Cosmic Bubble), surrounding a Wolf‚ÄìRayet star named EZ Canis Majoris. This star is in the brief, pre-supernova phase of its stellar evolution. The nebula is about away from Earth, but some sources indicate that both the star and the nebula are up to away. Yet others indicate the nebula is as close as from Earth.  Star  Sh2-308 surrounds the Wolf‚ÄìRayet star EZ Canis Majoris, also designated EZ CMa or WR 6. Its apparent magnitude varies from 6.71 to 6.95. Its spectral type indicates that the star is very hot and luminous. The spectrum shows that it is devoid of hydrogen at the surface. EZ Canis Majoris is expected eventually to explode in a supernova, therefore subsuming the nebula.  Formation  The nebula was formed about 70,000 years ago by the star EZ Canis Majoris throwing off its outer hydrogen layers, revealing inner layers of heavier elements. Fast stellar winds, blowing at from this star, create the bubble-shaped nebula as they sweep up slower moving material from an earlier phase of the star's evolution. The hydrogen composing the nebula is ionised by intense ultraviolet radiation. The nebula is approximately 60 light-years across at its widest point.  Observation  The most favorable period for observing the nebula in the night sky is between the months of December and April. Its southern declination makes it easier to observe from the Southern Hemisphere, though it is easily visible from most of the Northern Hemisphere as well. It appears as a faint cloud in photographs taken with high-power amateur instruments, with the help of special filters.

Course It flows through Swart-Mfolozi, Ceza, Nongoma and eventually has a confluence with the White Umfolozi near the southeastern boundary of Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve to form the Umfolozi River. The Thangami Safari Spa is also situated on its banks. Empangeni and Mtubatuba are two major areas related to the Lower Umfolozi region. History Zwide, chief of king of the very powerful Ndwandwe tribe had his own domain north and east of the Black Umfolozi River.

Early life and education Joseph was born in Penang, Malaya to Sri Lankan Tamil parents. His extended family were Roman Catholics, with his cousin, Dominic Vendargon, becoming the first Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur. Joseph commenced school at St. Xavier's Institution in Penang in 1935. Joseph prepared for the University Entrance Examination as a science student studying pure mathematics, applied mathematics, physics and geography at St. Patrick's College, Jaffna. In 1949, Joseph entered University of Ceylon (Colombo campus) to study for a four-year mathematics degree, obtaining a first class degree in three years. Career Joseph joined the University of Ceylon (Colombo campus) as an assistant lecturer in 1952 where he stayed for the next 42 years. As one of the prominent mathematicians in Sri Lanka at the time, he represented the country at many international gatherings and organisations such as the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. He was sent by the University to King's College London in 1956 to commence a doctoral thesis in mathematical physics, joining a renowned group of General Relativity specialists, under the guidance of Professor Felix Pirani, to work on developing Einstein‚Äôs Theory of General Relativity. Joseph went on to publish a number of academic papers pertaining to this subject. His output of articles and lectures covering these themes, spanned a period of over 60 years, from 1955 to 2016. During his university career, which spanned over four decades, Joseph taught several generations of students, first as a lecturer and later as a professor. In addition to his university duties, Joseph was Chief Examiner for the GCE Advanced level examinations in mathematics for over twenty years, setting exam questions which were regarded to have been creative. He also authored an A-level mathematics textbook in Sinhala entitled Gathikaya in 1994. He maintained an interest in teaching throughout his later retirement, and in 2016 published an updated English edition of his book, Dynamics: Newtonian Relativity. Joseph gave his final lecture in 2016 entitled \\"Einstein: The Wunderkind\\". Personal life Joseph married Antonia (n√©e Arulanandam) in 1965 and they had two children, Umesh and Arulesh. Joseph and his family were badly affected during the ethnic riots of 1983. According to witnesses, before a mob ransacked his house in Colombo, Joseph was asked whether he was a Tamil or a Sinhalese. He replied in Sinhala: \\"I am a human being\\". Following this statement, he was physically assaulted.

Hotamisligil (born June 24, 1962) is a Turkish-American physician scientist; James Stevens Simmons Chair of Genetics and Metabolism; Department of Genetics and Complex Diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH); Director of the Sabri √úlker Center for Metabolic Research and associate member of Harvard-MIT Broad Institute, Harvard Stem Cell Institute and the Joslin Diabetes Center. Hotamisligil has been a pioneer in research efforts to explain the mechanistic basis of common chronic metabolic diseases; particularly obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease, and atherosclerosis. His work has led to the emergence of novel concepts that have altered the understanding of metabolic disease pathogenesis.  Biography  G√∂khan Hotamisligil was born in Rize, Turkey and after attending elementary schools in Vakfikebir, Turgutlu, and Gediz; he graduated from the public Ankara Atat√ºrk Anadolu High School in 1980. He then received his degree in medicine from Ankara University Medical School in 1986 and his PhD from Harvard Medical School (HMS) in 1994. Hotamisligil joined the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH) as an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition & Division of Biological Sciences. He was promoted to tenured professor in 2003. He founded the Department of Genetics & Complex Diseases in the same year and served as the chair of the department. In 2014, the Sabri √úlker Center for Nutrient, Genetic, and Metabolic Research at HSPH was established by the √úlker family to honor their late father Sabri √úlker and to support the research in the laboratory of Hotamisligil. Dr. Hotamisligil is the founding Director of the Sabri √úlker Center at Harvard. Hotamisligil has been recognized with many fellowships and awards over the course of his career. These include election as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Naomi Berrie Award for Outstanding Achievement in Diabetes Research, the Outstanding Scientific Accomplishment Award from the American Diabetes Association, the Wertheimer Award for Outstanding Basic Research Contributions in the field of obesity from IASO, the Danone International Prize for Nutrition, and the Roy Greep Award for Outstanding Research from the Endocrine Society, EASD‚ÄìNovo Nordisk Foundation Diabetes Prize for Excellence, among others. He has also been the recipient of 2004 TUBITAK Science Award, Ko√ß Science Award and elected member of the Turkish Academy of Sciences. He also serves as a member of the board of trustees of Kadir Has University. Hotamisligil serves in many editorial boards including Science Translational Medicine, Cell Metabolism, EMBO molecular Medicine, Journal of Clinical Investigation, PlosBiology, and others.  Research  Hotamisligil‚Äôs research efforts focus on the molecular and genetic basis of common and complex diseases, particularly obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. His research examines the mechanisms of nutrient sensing and response pathways as they relate to immune and metabolic homeostasis. Hotamisligil‚Äôs work has been instrumental in the emergence of the immunological basis of obesity and diabetes and the field of immunometabolism,,. Today obesity and diabetes are understood as states of chronic, low-grade, sustained, systemic and metabolically orchestrated inflammation; also known as ‚Äúmetaflammation,‚Äù a concept introduced by Hotamisligil; which underlies the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. In a 2002 paper, the Hotamisligil lab established a link between activation of the inflammatory and stress kinase JNK and consequent inhibition of insulin receptor signaling via phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1). Since then, his lab has identified multiple other significant molecules and pathways as key modulators of chronic metabolic inflammation, insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in obesity, including the double stranded RNA dependent protein kinase PKR and the transmembrane protein STAMP2. The Hotamisligil lab also established the importance of organelle homeostasis in metabolic tissues and the role of organelle dysfunction in metabolic disease. In particular, they established that chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction is a feature of metabolic tissues in obesity, linked to regulation of insulin action and glucose and lipid metabolism. In subsequent studies they showed that the increase in ER stress in the obese condition is in part related to defects in autophagy, the cellular recycling system, as well as changes in lipid metabolism and ER membrane composition and result in alterations ER calcium homeostasis. Recently, the Hotamisligil lab also delineated abnormal interactions between ER and mitochondria in the context of metabolic disease that result in aberrant calcium metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Hotamisligil lab integrates these cellular and molecular stress pathways to nutrients through their work in an integrated field on lipid trafficking and signaling with a focus on fatty acid binding proteins, de novo lipogenesis products. In a 2008 paper, Hotamisligil lab described a lipid natured hormone, which they named as a ‚Äúlipokine‚Äù and showed its beneficial actions on lipid and glucose metabolism. In 2015, Hotamisligil lab described a novel hormone that is produced by the adipose tissue during fasting to regulate hepatic glucose production and pancreatic activity. Therapeutic targeting of both of these molecules is pursued for the treatment of metabolic diseases. In a 2017 paper, Hotamisligil lab has identified a transcription factor, NRF1, that both senses and responds to excess cholesterol in the ER and acts together with SREBP2 as yin-yang to keep ER cholesterol levels within a safe, narrow range. As of 2019, Hotamisligil has authored over 185 publications, which have received in excess of 85,000 citations and was named as an inventor on multiple patents. He has an h-index of 105. Hotamisligil has also been a mentor to many students and fellows who are now pursuing their independent scientific careers in many capacities around the world. He has been an advocate of science as a vehicle of diplomacy between cultures and delivered more than 300 lectures around the world.  Personal life  Hotamisligil is married to Selen Ciliv, a physician scientist specialized in assisted infertility treatment technologies and clinical applications and a consultant to World Health Organization. Their two children Leyla and Derin live in the United States and Canada. His late father Hulki Hotamisligil was a physician and mother G√ºner Hotamisligil was a teacher who served in remote regions of Turkey to support public health and education.

The iron hammer works lies on the River Auma in the village of Liebsdorf in the borough of Weida, just below the Auma Dam.  History  In 1770 the first attempts took place to erect a hammer works on this site. The iron hammer forge was built using an available weir which was being used to irrigate the sheep pastures of Liebsdorf. In order to make better use of the water power, the building was dug into the earth, rather like a cellar. This enabled a drop of 2.70 metres for the two overshot wheels. In earlier times, the mill made tools and components for other mills, as well as hammers, wagon parts, metal tyres, fittings, anvils, surface plates, wagon axles and ‚Äì usually in summer when the water level was low ‚Äì horseshoe nails. The bell clappers made here were well known far beyond Weida; several are supposed to have weighed four hundredweight. These clappers may be found today in Naumburg Cathedral, Erfurt Cathedral, in Magdeburg, in Cologne and even in the Church of the Redeemer in Jerusalem. The operation was closed in 1921.  Today  In 1990 work began on renovating the technical monument. With the aid of monument conservation the following work was carried out: renewal of the roofing and roof truss, restoration of the mill ditch and rebuilding of two weirs as well as the restoration of the east wall. These renovation measures were carried out under the supervision of an architect, an statistician and a geologist. In 1990 the hammer mill was sold to a private buyer.  Literature  * B. Gunkel, E.-J.

Early life The Siordets was an Huguenot family from Switzerland, near Geneva, on the France border. In the 18th century they moved to London. They were businessmen: bankers and shipping agents. George Crosbie Siordet, Gerald Caldwell Siordet‚Äôs father, was co-founder of \\"Siordet and Meyer.\\" Siordet studied at Clifton College and Balliol College, Oxford. Career After Oxford, Siordet lived in London trying to make a living as artist, poet, and critic. He worked at the New English Art Club, the Fine Art Society, the Medici Society, the Victoria and Albert Museum. He also wrote freelance reviews for The Studio (magazine) and other art magazines. Gerald C. Siordet, Drawing, 1912, by Brian Hatton Siordet was friend with Glyn Philpot, Gerald Spencer Pryse, Henry Justice Ford, John Singer Sargent, Brian Hatton and William Morris‚Äôs wife, Jane Morris (n√©e Burden). Siordet met Brian Hatton in January 1906. In January 1912 Hatton set up a studio in London and shared it with Siordet: they called it The Bronze Door. Hatton enlisted in August 1914 as trooper in the Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars, a Yeomanry regiment of the British Army. Before leaving for his service, he sold a picture of Siordet wearing a helmet for only 35 guineas. When Siordet heard of Hatton's death during the Battle of Katia on Sunday 23 April 1916, he asked to Captain Val Burkhardt (Siordet's cousin), who was serving in Egypt, for more information. Burkhardt managed for a memorial to be put on the place of the battle. With the name Gerald Caldwell he had two poems printed in the Times. The first poem, \\"Autumn 1914\\" was printed on 13 November 1914. On 30 November 1915, Siordet's second poem To the Dead was first print in the Times; it was subsequently reprinted in A Crown of Amaranth (1917) and included in the collection A Book of Verse of the Great War (1917). Siordet's contribution to the collection has been highlighted by The Dublin Review (1918) and by Henry Seidel Canby in Education by Violence: Essays on the War and the Future (1919). World War I Gerald Caldwell Siordet (1885-1917) In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, Siordet enlisted and at first he joined as a private. In July 1915, he was promoted 2nd Lieutenant in France while with the Rifle Brigade, 13th Battalion. On 1 July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme, he received the Military Cross for \\"conspicuous gallantry\\" in a failed attack that killed one of his closest friends, Geoffrey Watkins Smith. The motivation for his military cross was: Siordet joined the Mesopotamian campaign in January 1917 with the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), 6th Battalion. Death Siordet died on 9 February 1917, leading an attack on the Turkish position near Kut-al-Amara. His body was never recovered. His name is inscribed in the Chapel Passage, West Wall, at Balliol College, together with those other Balliol College's alumni lost during World War I.

Characters =Konron (Kun Lun)= ; * :The protagonist of the series. He is a disciple at Konronsan and Genshitenson's best pupil. He received the Hoshin project from Genshitenson, and became a strategist to defeat the collapsing Yin Dynasty and to help the Buo of the Shu. Although he wears very strange clothes, he has the sharpest mind in Konron. Taikoubo was the son of the leader of the Kyo tribe, and was named Ryo Bo, but he lost his parents in a Yin human hunt. After twelve years on earth, he became a disciple, and with 30 years of study, attained Senin level power. Though, Taikobo is still an average Senin with a low rank, he is the personal disciple of the leader of Konronsan, Genshitenson, so his position in the Senkai (spirit world) is high. At the beginning of the story, he receives a retractable baton-shaped Paopei (Magic Tool) called Dashinben, which grants him the power to create and control wind. Later, because of the Orb of Revival, the Dashinben gets an upgrade, a larger shape and improved abilities. Eventually, his Dashinben is upgraded by fusing with the paopei 'Kyokoki' that can absorb Konronsan's energy for recovery, and the super paopei, 'Taikyokuzu,' that negates all other paopei's power,draw magic seals and can heal injuries. Basically, his speciality is fighting by wits, and using cleverness to swindle his enemies, so that sometimes even his allies boo him. His constant companion, main ally, and mode of transportation is the spirit beast, Supushan. Taikobo's real age is at least 72 years old, and contrary to his boyish appearance, love of peaches and sweet things, and dislike of shots and medicine, his speech and mannerisms are that of an old man. His personality is aloof, and he has a strong belief in a peaceful human world. Additionally, he is left-handed, but during the fight with Inkou (the older), he lost his left arm up to the elbow. Soon after, he received an artificial arm created by Taiitsu Shinjin. :Although Taikobo is often criticized by other characters for being very 'un- protagonist-like,' he was voted first in a Jump magazine character poll twice. From time to time, the author changes his drawing into a simple shape, with a circle and two points for a head and a stick figure like body. The last volume of the Kanzenban came with a limited edition plush toy of this form. ; * :Taikoubou's spirit beast who has the appearance of a white hippo (his original design was more like a dragon). Suupuushan uses the inflection \\"~su\\" at the end of sentences. He has adult-like and serious personality. Originally, he lived in his birthplace in the Suupuu valley in Northern Europe with his parents, Suupuupapa and Suupuumama, but Suupuupapa, Genshitenson's spirit beast, was greatly wounded in a battle with Chou Koumei, and was forced to retire. In order to support the family, a young Suupuushan went off to work. From the beginning, he carries the Orb of Revival, which he uses to come back to life in a temporary adult form after he was killed in the battle with Chou Koumei. In his adult form, his voice and speech patterns change, and, like all adults of his species, can eat paopei energy. The battle with Bunchuu activates a licence designating Supushan as an adult, and from that point forward, he is able to transform at will. Later, he receives a second Orb of Revival, recovered from the ruins of Kingo Island. ; * :A living human-paopei (divine superweapon) hybrid, he was once dead and now revived, with the aid of Taiitsu, built via lotus plant. He exists largely to fight and is more \\"directed\\" by Taikoubou (provided that he actually listens), albeit at times that becomes hazardous to Taikoubou's health, as Nataku has no qualms about shooting his weapons at people. He can fly thanks to his special paopei, Fuukarin, boots which have a metal wheel under each one. He also possesses a weapon paopei in the shape of 2 iron bracelets called Kenkonen, which work as homing missiles and striking his target with tremendous force. Throughout the manga, Nataku gets several \\"up grades\\", namely from Taiitsu who gives him new weapons. Towards the end, Nataku becomes paopei \\"customized\\" and has the super paopei Kinkousen (previously wielded by Chou Koumei) which allows him to summon Dragons made of light. :Nataku may seem cold and emotionless, but, according to himself, he has a serious grudge against his father who was responsible for destroying the grave his mother made for him when he died; Nataku has had many chances to kill his father, but never did. Nataku also has a soft spot for his mother, and also for Ko Hiko's fourth son Tensho, whom he took care of after most of his family died. ; * :A disciple at Konronsan. Actually, he is the son of the leader of Kingoto, Tsutenkyoushu and a yokai senin. He surpassed his teacher and has power equal to a senin, but because he does not want to take a student, remains one himself. His senin name is Kenseijiro Shinkun. He is a person of extreme confidence and takes great pride in his appearance. At first, he doubted Taikoubou's strength, and proposed a test, but finally approved of his means and became an ally. He has the ability to change into the body of any living thing, although his favorite transformation is that of Dakki. When transforming into a doshi or senin, he can use the other's paopei, but if they are a higher level, he cannot copy them perfectly. Because of his ability to transform without using paopei, even the Seninkai call him the genius disciple. Halfway through the series, he learns how to use a partial transformation and only change part of his body. This way, he can copy multiple of paopei at the same time. When he becomes hanyotai, his strength is increased. His own paopei are 'Sansento,' a giant fork shaped weapon that can release a shock wave, and 'Kotenken' a paopei with the appearance of a dog which lives in his sleeve and can be called to attack enemies or used as a riding mount to fly. Towards the end, he obtained the cape super paopei 'Rikukonhan,' which wraps up enemies so that not even their soul escapes. After the final battle, he founded the new Seninkai. ; * :A tennendoushi who used to be a woodcutter in Seiki. He proclaims himself as Taikobo's disciple. His aspiration to become Taikobo's disciple was quickly refused, but later, he saves Taikobo's life, and eventually travels together with him. His personality is natural and true to himself. His eyesight is 10.0, can perceive infra-red light, and can see in the dark. He has the ability to run on water. When he is overly emotional, his fighting strength increases a surprising amount, even enough to injure senin. He has had an abundance of unusual part time jobs, including elephant trainer and bird breeder. Although no one except sendo should be able to touch paopei, Bukichi is seen many times coming into contact with them. ; * :As an infant, he was saved by Ki Sho and became his 100th child. He only had one senin bone, however, he became the disciple of the eccentric Konronsan senin, Unchushi. Under his experiments, Raishinshi's skin became black, and he grew the wind and lighting controlling, wing-shaped paopei, Tensoyoku, from his back. With that power, he successfully escaped from Unchushi's tyrannical experiments, and thought to return to his father, but concerned with his current form, he instead gained fame as thief for the people, during which he fought and lost to Taikoubou. At this chance, he disbanded his group of thieves, and after training in Konronsan, he participated in the Shu revolution. :Because he was busy having his wings remodeled (increasing power and upgrading to three pairs), he has proportionately less screen time than other characters. However, toward the final battle, his number of appearances increase. In the manga version, by the time of his father's, Ki Sho's, death, they had not met, but in the anime they are reunited. Raishinshi is a comedy relief type character with a hot temper. ; * :Originally, the Yin's Chinkoku Buseio. He is the father of Ko Tenka and Ko Tensho. His superhuman is strength is such that he can destroy even paopei with his bare hands. His body can endure very strong poisons, and he has the force of will to withstand mind control by a super paopei, as he is a tennendoushi (a human with senin bones). For generations, his ancestors served the Yin, so he was loyal to Chuo, but could not withstand Dakki's conniving. He met Taikobo who came to defeat Dakki, and they immediately trusted and respected one other. Some years later, Hiko lost his wife, Kashi and his sister, Koshi, to Dakki's schemes and decided to leave the Yin. After which, he was appointed Kaikoku Buseiou by Ki Shou of the Shuu. He has a rough and cheerful personality. Before he left for the Shuu, he was friends with Bunchuu, however, afterwards, they were irreconcilable and ended up fighting during the Sennin war, during which Hiko was hoshin-ed. In the anime, he lived, and he and Bunchuu parted on friendly terms. ; * :A disciple at Konronsan, and Ko Hiko's second son. One of the Juunisen, Seikyo Dotoku Shinkun, discovered and recruited him as a doushi. He appeared to save his father, who was being chased by pursuers from the Yin rebellion. He has his father's upstanding spirit and fighting skills, but his mother's, Kashi's, black hair. He uses the inflection \\"-sa\\" at the end of a sentence, and is always smoking a cigarette. He is master of the lightsaber-like paopei, 'Bakuya no Hoken,' and later receives a fire-emitting, boomerang paopei called 'Karyuhyo,' and the tiny 'Sanshintei.' Lastly, he could use the 'Bakuya no Hoken 2,' which has a blade on either side of the handle. Because of his absolute self confidence in close combat, and too much of a warrior's spirit, he extremely hates to lose. As a result of a cursed wound received from one of Chou Koumei's yokai senin subordinates, his life was shortened. He fought Chuo in order to avenge his mother, but the moment he defeated him, he lost his resolve. Immediately after, he was run through by the sword of a nameless soldier and hoshin-ed; this only happens in the manga, however, as he lives in the anime and even appears to have a love interest. He has a rough attitude and would jump to conclusions. ; * :Ko Hiko's fourth and youngest son, a Tennendoshi who inherited his father's strengths. He views Nataku as a friend and older brother, perhaps ignorant of the destructive tendencies Nataku possesses. After his mother, aunt, father and brother die, Tensho closed himself off, until Nataku told him that he would take care of Tensho, and that he would never lose or die. At first, Tensho used a spear for a weapon, but after his father's death, switched to using Hito. ; :Originally a doshi from Kingoto, she was dispatched by Bunchu as a spy. As a result of falling in love with Dokouson, she turned traitor and joined with the Shu along with her father, Tokyuko. The wrong impression is a violent, wholeheartedly bright young girl. She is not good at telling things like hippos or Capybaras, but she gets along with Supushan and calls Dokoson 'Honey.' Her Paopei, 'Gokoseki,' has the ability that once thrown, it will always hit its target, and give them the appearance of wearing too much make-up, but there was a limiter that suppressed its power to 1/5. When the limiter was canceled, its destructive power increased. After the final battle, she got her wish and married a reluctant Dokoson. ; * :The disciple of one of the Juunisen, Doko Tenson. There is little known about him before he came to the Seninkai. He likes bad puns and sake. However, he is more serious than he appears. His sense of touch is finely attuned, and he uses that in order to fight. His paopei, 'Goumasho' is a boring but powerful, blunt weapon, like a rounded club, which transforms into a sharp edged sword. The side of him that comes out from being around Taikobo is mercenary like and lazy. ; * :A pure blooded Sennyo (a child of two Sennin parents), she can only live in the pure air of the Sennin world, and as the air of the human world is poisonous to her, she rarely descends there. She wields the water paopei, Muroken Konmo, and is constantly surrounded by a protective water veil. She is said to be at a very high level, comparable to Dakki or Bunchu, but because of her condition, she does not fight often. ; * :Raishinshi's master, Unchuushi is one of the freaks of the Sennin World (along with Doutoku and Taiitsu). He likes biology to the point of obsession, and regularly performs experiments on people. Raishinshi is one of the best examples, being given the apricot which would give him wings, then having his wings made bigger and multiplied when asleep. Unchuushi was overjoyed when he found a parasitic paopei on himself, finally given the chance to experiment with his own body. ; * :He does not have a paopei, as he trained in martial arts while in Konron (although he did use a sword to duel Buseio), and his reijyu, Shinyo, is the leader of all birds, therefore, he also has the power to control them. He has a strange way of talking, and is a character that goes at his own pace. ;The :A group of elite Sennin. ; :A former member of the Juunisen who left Konron 500 years before the beginning of the series during a staged fight with Genshitenson. By leaving the Sennin world, he was able to hunt down Jyoka in secret.While he is skilled in the use of paopei , his mastery of 'Magic Spells' allow him to fight without any weapons, capable of even stopping a super paopei with his bare hands. He cares very deeply about his half-sister, Ryukitsu Koshu, to the point that other characters comment on his devotion. :Fujiryu re-used an earlier design he made for the game \\"The Great Sennin World War\\" and recolored the character to create Nentou. ; * :Taiitsu Shinjin is the machine-crazy Sennin who is responsible for putting the Reijyu into Inshi's (Li Sei's wife, and Nataku's mother) stomach, creating the birth of the paopei human Nataku; in a sense, he is Nataku's father. Despite that, Taiitsu is \\"bullied\\" by Nataku for repair of his broken paopei, or demanding new paopei (however, Taiitsu still seems to view Nataku as a son, and cares deeply for him). Even though Taiitsu is rather weak, he is acknowledged as one of the Junisen because of his ability to create paopei; many things like the Kokinrikushi (the flying robot paopei) and Konron 2 were made by Taiitsu. Although he has made many paopei, his main one is a nutshell-like protection paopei (its main use is to shut Nataku in whenever he disobeys him). :Taiitsu also provides some of the comic relief in the story in that he is scared of heights, and that he will always look for the camera and look into it while talking. ; * :Fugen is Taikobo's kind- hearted friend from when the two did their training together, and he is a person very much like Taikobo, in that he does not wish for anyone to get hurt, even if it means the sacrifice of himself. In battle, he always aims for negotiation, and is always smiling even in dire situations. Fugen is also the one who gave Taikobo a straight fishhook, saying that the fish shouldn't suffer just for the sake of Taikobo thinking. He is a Sennin well-versed in chemistry, and his paopei is one which controls the atoms. He is one of the Konron Junisen, the one who replaced Nento Doujin after his faked death. His disciple is Mokutaku. :Fugen perceives Taikobo as family, deciding years ago that he would not allow Taikobo to die, no matter what. He was killed in the Great Sennin War. ; * :Gyokutei Shinjin is the stereotype \\"cool\\" guy, and takes everything too seriously. He is Yozen's master, and one of the few people Youzen sees as being above him, even when Youzen's abilities surpass Gyokutei's. He was killed by Otenkun in the Great Sennin War while protecting Youzen. Gyokutei's paopei, \\"Zensenken,\\" is of a slicing type, being able to cut at high speeds. He is one of the Konron Junisen. ; * :Doutoku is a Sennin obsessed with sports, and also the master of Ko Tenka. He wields the Bakuya no Houken 2, the same as Tenka's lightsaber-like paopei, except double-ended. Before his death in the Great Sennin War, he entrusts Yozen with his paopei, to give to Tenka. He is one of the Konron Junisen. ; * :A member of the Juunisen who has the appearance of a baby with a long tail. He ends his sentences with \\"-chu\\" and acts cutely, although at times he has a much harsher personality, such as when Nataku threatened to leave him behind in Kingo. His paopei, \\"Bannou Bouchou,\\" looks like a knife. His disciple is Igo. ; :A militaristic member of the Juunisen and Inko's master. His paopei is the Bantennin. He was killed in the Great Sennin War while fighting Bunchu. ; :A member of the Junisen, he wields the Onmyoukyou paopei. He trained the younger brother Inkou, and always has a visor over his eyes and carries a sword. He was killed in the fight with Bunchuu. ; :A member of the Juunisen who has the paopei \\"Rakkonsho\\". He was killed in the fight with Bunchu. ; :A member of the Juunisen with the paopei \\"Konsenjou.\\" He was killed in the fight with Bunchu. ; :A member of the Juunisen with the paopei \\"Rurihei,\\" a rocket-launcher type. He was killed in the fight with Bunchu. ; :A member of the Juunisen, and one of the first to die in the fight against Bunchu. ; * :A member of the Juunisen, and one of the first to die in the fight against Bunchu. =Kingo (Jin Yao)= ; * :One of the Sandai Sennin (along with Genshi Tenson and Taijo Roukun) and leader of the Kingoto Yokai. He wields the Super Paopei, Rikukonhan. It is revealed during the course of the series that Youzen is his son, whom he traded with Genshi Tenson for O Eki in order to ease tensions between Kingo and Konron. ; :One of the Sankyou Sennin, a plant based Yokai known for his fabulousness. He has the Super Paopei Kinkousen, which has the appearance of a pair of gardening shears. Its attack releases seven rainbow dragons when fully utilized. He also created the Bakuryusaku, a projection paopei that took him 1000 years to develop. He uses random French phrases in his speech, and is often seen holding a wine glass. His houhin is remarkably gorgeous, including a circle of light and a choir of cherub angels. ;The * :Chou Koumei's three younger sisters, Venus, Queen and Madonna. Their real names are Unshou, Keishou, and Hekishou, but they refuse to be called by that. They use the paopei Kinkousen, Kongenkinto, Kyodaibaopeerobo, and the Mysterious Veil. Venus is in (very unrequited) love with Taikoubou, and Madonna is constantly eating. Madonna is extremely obese but can move by eating special candies made by her sisters, Queen looks like a hideous old witch, Venus looks like a very muscular cross dressing man in a nurses outfit. Together they can use \\"Khyuukyokkukougajin\\" which creates a dimension where the three sisters are the size of giants and the enemy is shrunk to the size of ants on a humongous table full of candy. ; :The parallel organization to Konron's Juunisen. The Jittenkun is a group of ten yokai sennin, headed by Outenkun. They use \\"Juuzetsujin\\" dimensional Paopei. They can combine they dimensions (mostly in pairs that have dimensions that complements one another). ; * :Originally a human disciple of Genshitenson's named Ou Eki, he was traded to Tsuuten Kyoushu for Youzen in order to maintain relations between Kingo and Konron. Because Kingou does not allow humans, he was locked away until Dakki appeared and split his soul into three and giving them yokai bodies. :He has the paopei Kousuijin which causes acid rain, and the paopei dani, an animal type peopei like Youzen's Koutenken, but in the form of tiny ticks that secretly latch onto sennin and drain their energy as if they were constantly using a peopei. ; * :One of the Jutenkun who controls the dimensional paopei \\"Kousajin\\" which creates a sand dimension. He can control all the sand in his dimension and as long as the enemy is in his dimension they start to dehydrate and crumble into sand adding to the dimension. He has very long arms and walks on his fingers with his feet curled up under him, he also wears an armadillo mask with a body and tail that covers his back. He was defeated by Youzen. ; * :A yokai with the appearance of a toy. His dimensional paopei, \\"Keketsujin,\\" uses the form of a child's room, where he has control over all his toys (he can make them explode to attack), as well as the ability to turn his opponents into toys if they lose against him in a game. He is killed by Gyokutei Shinjin. ; * :A Jutenkun who looks like a bug. His \\"Fukoujin\\" dimension paopei only has one pillar suspended above a thin net that can cut through flesh, and permeated by a strong wind. He is killed by falling off the pillar, after being tricked by the Ko family. ; * :A member of the Jutenkun who controls the ice dimension paopei, \\"Kanbyojin.\\" He is indirectly killed by Fugen. ; * :A different Choutenkun to the one above, his appearance is that of a talking stone slab monolith, his dimensional paopei is called \\"Chiretsujin.\\" He is killed by Nataku. ; * :A Jutenkun who is dress in a priest like robe, he wields the dimensional paopei \\"Rakkojin\\", which is a variety of paper runes that cause explosions or fire beams (both attacks damage the enemies body and soul). He fights together with Kinkou Seiba. He is killed by Igo. ; * :A Jutenkun who that wears a witch's hat and a cloak which renders her whole body invisible except for gloved hands. She wields the dimensional paopei \\"Kinkojin\\" which can bend or emit light. Those trapped in her dimension are forced to fight their own shadows (dealing damage to themselves) unless they stay out of the light she emits. She fights as a team with Yotenkun. She is killed by Nataku. ; A Jutenkun that appears as a some kind of stone altar. It wields the dimensional paopei \\"Retsuenjin\\" which can created powerful balls of flames (akin to volcanic eruptions). Working together with Shintenkun's \\"Tenzetsujin\\" to create a barrage of flaming meteors. It is accidentally hoshin-ed by Madonna. ; :Twin yokai who are always conjoined together. They wield the dimensional paopei \\"Tenzetsujin\\" which creates an outer space like dimension full of meteors. Working together with Hakutenkun's \\"Retsuenjin\\" to create a barrage of flaming meteors. They are accidentally hoshin-ed by Madonna. =Shu (Zhou)= ;, * :A benevolent and decent man who rules the West of China. He had 26 wives and 100 children. He is reluctant to turn on his Emperor, despite the absolute evil that the man engages in until his son's murder. He died of self induced starvation because he could not bring himself to eat after learning that he had eaten his eldest son in the form of a meat patty that he jokingly called \\"Hamburg steak\\" in front of the meal server. In the anime, he is able to escape from Chouka thanks to Ko Hiko and with the help of Taikoubou, he returns with his army to overthrow the Yin. ; * :Ki Sho's oldest son. He is true to himself, capable and handsome, but in order to save Ki Sho, he went to the capitol of the In, Choka, and was killed by Dakki. His murder was depicted in chapter 25 titled \\"Dakki and Kibi's 3-Minute Cooking\\", in which the two cheerfully prepared a meal for his father with his flesh. ; * :Ki Sho's second oldest son. He is a gambler, pervert, and idiot, but also capable of ruling a country justly. After his father Ki Shou died, Hatsu took on the throne, leading the Shou to victory against the Yin. When first introduced, Hatsu was a pervert deep in debt, but at the end, he was a king who the people greatly admire and like. ; :Yukyo is one of the few left of the Kyo clan, a relative of Taikobo. Yukyo and Ryo Bo are the only remaining members of the royal bloodline. She was raised by Roshi via hologram. After helping Ki Hatsu win the battle in Bokuya, she stayed in Choka, and eventually became his wife. ; :A general of the Shu. After Kou Hiko came to the Shuu, he dropped to the No. 2 position, so they clashed all the time, but after Hiko's death, Nan Kyukatsu became depressed and missed their competition. He is a very hot blooded man. ; * :The evil but coward father of Nataku is a former Senjin. Instead of a man with good personality, in the manga, he only shows his weakness to his children. Thanks to Taikoubou, Risei wants to change his personality and goes to Konron to continue study Taoist. ; * :Wife of Ri Sei and mother of Nataku, Mokutaku and Kintaku. She is pictured as a somewhat beautiful woman, but with no spectacular intellectual abilities. In fact, we could say Inshi is air headed and doesn't think much. She loves Nataku but refuses to understand both her son's and her husband's mistakes. She does not seem to be bothered by Li Sei's hatred towards Nataku, nor to the latter's attempts at killing his father. She is Nataku's weak point and some enemies took advantage of this weakness on various occasions. Not much is seen of Inshi during the anime or the manga. ; * :The intelligent younger brother of Ki family. He helps his brothers to rule the country and train the Shuu forces. =In (Yin)= ; * :The last Emperor of the Yin dynasty. Chu O, originally a good emperor with only weakness in woman, obeys almost all of Dakki's whims. His moments of sanity are rare and only Bunchuu's influence managed to have an effect upon him. He is the husband of Kyohi and Koshi (actually, his harem consists of almost 200 women) and father of Inko (Yin Jiao) and Inko (Yin Hong). Before Dakki put him under his control, the Emperor cared about the people and his family but after the misfortunate marriage with the fox yokai, he lost all his senses. It is said Chu pocesses Herculean-like strength and has been known to easily wrestle lions and bulls with his bare hands. ; * :The main antagonist of the series. Overtaking So Dakki's body (a young woman who was brought to the imperial palace to be Chu O's 200th wife) Dakki the Sennyo bewitched the Emperor with the aid of her spell of Temptation. Chu O became nothing but a puppet in her hands, doing exactly as Dakki pleased and having very rare moments of sanity. The vixen demon is 5,000 years old, very beautiful and intelligent to the point when she could be labeled as \\"genius\\". In the manga, her character is more complex, but in the anime, she is pictured as the evil, selfish Empress who wants nothing but power and cares only about herself and her two sisters (not blood related, however) O Kijin and Ko Kibi. :She is capable of using multiple paopeis at once (ex: two fans, the Veil of Temptation). Her most important paopei is the Veil of Temptation and she is rarely seen without it. It emits a strong scent which affects all men and bring them under control. In order to resist the spell, one needs an iron will. After her descent into the Human World, she took many names (Ou Shi, Bakki) and seduced the leaders, living in luxury. At first, she was content to throw over the top and overpriced parties, but after several hundreds of years, she mastered the Temptation spell and began her reign of cruelty. :Dakki obviously enjoys other people's torment. She even built torture devices like the Horaku or the Taibon (a pit full of poisonous snakes). She is a very good actress and is capable of hiding her emotions. Another ability would be her good knowledge of human psychology. In the manga, when Chu O's first wife was imprisoned, Dakki knew the woman could not stand the pressure any longer and allowed the guard to give the true empress anything she wished for, knowing that she will ask for a dagger in order to commit suicide. She predicted Bunchu's reaction when Ko Hiko left Choka. Bunchu and Hiko were friends and Bunchu would rather kill Hiko himself than let Dakki decide how and when it would be done. :She shows sympathy only to her sisters and to her adopted son, Ou Eki/O Tenkun. Cruel as Dakki might be, she turned out not to be entirely evil in the end. In the manga the reason Dakki worked for Jyoka was at first due to her desire for power. But after she learned about the Ancients and that they fused with the planet, she was deeply affected and so her secret goal became to obtain Jyoka's body so she too may become one with the world. In this way she was able to save Taikobo at the end. :In the manga, her lines almost always end with heart shapes. ; * :The youngest of Dakki's sisters, she is 1,000 years old and a yokai sennin. Her true form is that of a stone lute. Ou Kijin can be hot headed and this gets her into trouble twice in the manga. The youkai sennin is smart, but she is eventually outwitted by Taikobou. She has an older sister, Ko Kibi, to which she shows affection, especially in the anime, where they can often be seen together. Kijin has the Shiju Hagoromo, made by Tsuten Kyoshu from the silk of a poison moth. It acts not only as a powerful poison and a corrosive acid, but she can ignite it with a spark to cause great damage. ; * :One of Dakki's sisters. Although she is far older than Kijin, she's very childish to the point of being creepy. Her real form is that of a Chikeisei bird (a time bird, whose feathers can turn anyone they touch younger and younger until they are nothing). She acts in a silly manner most of the time and does not understand much, but is caring towards her elder and younger sister (in the manga, she saves O Kijin after she lost a battle and returned to her original form). She has a major crush on Supushan and even surrendered her Nyoi Hagoromo to Taikobo in order to prevent him from hurting Suupuu (of course, that was one of Taikobo's tricks). She has a transformation ability which rivals Yozen's. With the aid of her Hagoromo, she can transform into anyone, even Dakki. Kousen in Houshin Engi Gaiden is her younger brother. Ko Kibi can sense the presence of his younger brother when her younger brother is in same timeline. :In the manga, her lines almost always end with star shapes. ; * :The Yin military strategist, he has been protecting the Yin because of a promise he made to his comrade Shushi, a lively young woman he once trained with. Bunchuu has been the Yin's strategist and protector for 300 years and he had 30 emperors under his care. He was a disciple of T-san and became the second strongest under T-san. Determined to protect the Yin Dynasty, he was a formidable enemy. In the anime, he was the first who killed Dakki, after the Yin dynasty had fallen. His only close friend was Hiko, whose death prompted him to render his obsession meaningless and subsequently chose to end his own life. His spirit travels back to Choka and he bows one last time to Emperor Chu O. Then, he travels to the Yin burial grounds and sees the spirit of Shuushi, who thanks him for \\"doing such a great job\\" with the dynasty. Bunchuu's spirit is seen later in the Houshindai, when he told to his follower Cho Kei to find his own path. :In the anime Bunchu does not die. After Dakki is defeated, he flies off on his spiritual beast. When asked where are they going, he answers: \\"Who knows?\\" ; * :Wife of Buseio and mother of his four children. Kashi is considered to be one of China's most beautiful and graceful women. Her beauty is renowned and reached even Chu O's ear, triggering the unfortunate events that led to her tragic death. She loves her husband deeply and takes great pride in being his wife. In the anime, she took care of the princes while their mother was imprisoned and even went out to face Dakki, in hope of getting Kyohi freed. She is pictured as being a kind, loving and at the same time strong woman, who endangered herself for the sake of the princes, whom she considered \\"the country's future\\". :In the manga, her character gets less scenes and her most important one is when she visits her sister-in-law and falls into Dakki's trap (chapter 26). :Unlike the manga, in the anime her soul is sent to the Hoshindai. ; * :In the novel, she was called \\"Concubine Huang\\" and was one of many Chu O's wives. She is the younger sister of Buseio Ko Hiko. In the manga, she was confined to the imperial harem, but in the anime, she seems to be free to go wherever she wants. Koshi is an admirable character: she tried (in vain) to save the Empress from the soldiers who came to arrest her and even blocked their way in a desperate attempt to prevent them from taking away the Empress. She was the one who took the two princes and placed them in Kashi's care. She is very close to Kashi and tried to protect her from the Emperor's eyes; she was outraged when she died because Chu O violated the rite between an Emperor and his vassals. Realising that Dakki will hold her as a hostage against her brother, she threw herself off the balcony and granted Ko Hiko his freedom. :Unlike the manga, in the anime her soul was sent to the Houshindai. ; * :The lovely daughter of the King of the East, she was considered the most beautiful woman in the empire by her husband (that is, before he saw Dakki and Kashi). Mother of the two princes and legal wife of the Emperor. After Dakki appeared and took over the Emperor's mind, the Empress became very depressed and could often be found crying. After her father was killed, she was accused of treason and imprisoned. Her royal pride and perhaps desperation determined her to commit suicide in her cell. In the anime, Kyouhi not only looks totally different from her manga counterpart, but she's a more lively character. Described by Buseio as being one of \\"the most refined ladies of the country\\" she was a kind, fair and generous person, loved by her people. At the end of Hoshin Engi, there are some family scenes from the life of the royal couple. She always stood by her husband's side and they were shown having a happy marriage. But after Dakki showed up, Kyohi became sad and placed a lot of pressure on her son, Inchao's shoulders, because she wanted him to become a good emperor and an honorable man, \\"just like his father\\". After Dakki accused her of plotting to kill the Emperor, she is imprisoned. Meanwhile, Kashi takes care of her children, thus becoming Dakki's next target. When she found out about Kashi's summoning, Kyohi foresaw Dakki's plan and tried to stop her by ordering her servant to go and call Buseio immediately. Buseiou and Bunchuu tried to make a plan to save the Empress, but failed to present something viable in time. Dakki convinced the Emperor to set his wife free and summoned her to the throne room. Kyohi defies Dakki, but in the end, she is forced by the Emperor to accept her gift. The gift proves to be a dagger that sticks to the hand magically. Scared, Kyohi hides the dagger from the inquiring Emperor, but eventually she unwillingly reveals the dagger. Framed, she sees no other way out and stabs herself with the dagger. Her last request was for Buseiou to take care of her children. :Both the manga and the anime Kyohis were sent to the Hoshin Dai. The only difference was that the manga Kyohi's human soul flew to the platform of souls, determining Taikobou to return to the Sennin World to investigate. Also, in the manga, her name changes into Kyoshi after the first half of the manga. =Unaffiliated= ; * :The most powerful doushi under Dakki's Allies. At the beginning of the manga, he prefers to stay outside of the affair, as to watch it from an angle, and see how things turn out. He is also the first doushi listed on the Hoshin, and is also the first to confront Taikobo (and asks him with an air of excitement if he is on the list to begin with). He, like Taikobo, has a spirit beast named Koutenko. Shinkyohyo's only paopei is the Raikouben; which he has only used against Taikobo. Raikouben's power was so tremendous that when Shinkyohyo first used it, he himself said that he was shocked at its abilities. Towards the middle of the series, he decides to side with Dakki, and persuades Chuuo's eldest son to fight for the Yin. Eventually, though, when Dakki tries to escape Taikobo, she is attacked by Shinkohyo's Raikouben, and helps weaken her when Taikobo slices her in half. Shinkyoho was the only doushi on the Hoshin list that did not get sent to Houshindai, and was still on Earth with Taikobo in the last chapter. ; :One of the Sandai Sennin, he is extremely lazy and spends most of his time sleeping. He created the resilient Taida suit to help him sleep peacefully. He used to be Shinkouhyou's master. ;Kousen :This character is only appear in Houshin Engi Gaiden manga version. :Kousen is Ko Kibi's younger brother. His real form is rare bird youkai Chikeisei. This bird youkai specie can travel freely in the past and future. It is the first time when Shinnou sent Taikobo and Shupushan to the past just at the moment when Kousen was resting up in same moment. He wanted to defeat Taikobo but unfortunately Taikobo didn't meet him in this moment. Kousen's appearance in past caused drastic change in Earth's history. Earth's history changed in large scale then Jyoka resurrected and destroyed the world. =The Original People= ; * :The strongest of the five Original People to come to Earth and the ultimate antagonist of the story. She has the paopei \\"Sangashashoku\\" and \\"Shihoken.\\" Her designs were to create the earth's history exactly the same as her world that evolved to the point where it was destroyed. The other Original People, not wishing for history to repeat itself, argued against this plan and put Jyoka in an eternal sleep, while they merged with the life of the planet, eventually creating the Sennin and Yokai. Jyoka has the ability to work behind the scenes as a spirit, while her body still sleeps, and subtly changes the world to more resemble her own, but when the histories diverge, she simply destroys the world and starts over. No one knows how long this cycle has been continuing until the current history. She has the ability to split her soul, which along with her regenerative abilities, make her a very difficult enemy to destroy completely. In the final battle, her body is taken over by Dakki before she can reach it, and Dakki uses that body to become the Great Mother and merge with the earth, like the other Original People. :There is much foreshadowing of Jyoka's appearance throughout the manga; for instance, Chou Koumei's ship is called the 'Queen Joker.' ; :One of the Original People, and the creator of the Houshin plan. He has the peopei Dashinben, Taikyokuzu, Chusenjin (snow that damages the soul), and Bansenjin. Fearing Jyoka's revival, he chose to remain and not merge with the earth like the other Original People. He became a human named Ou Eki and approached the Sandai Sennin with the Houshin plan, becoming Genshitenson's disciple. Genshitenson, realizing O Eki's ability to split his soul, divided him into two, returning one to O Eki (who would be traded with Tsuten Kyoshu for Yozen, and would become Otenkun) and keeping the other, eventually placing it in Ryo Bo, a deceased baby of the Kyou tribe (who would become Taikobou). Ou Eki loses his memories of being one of the Original People, and does not regain them until Taikobo and Otenkun merge to create Fukki. After merging, Fukki(who still identifies himself as Taikobo since he is the dominant personality) retains the ability to split,and can return to being Taikobo and Otenkun at will. ; :One of the Original People to come to Earth, and the owner of the mysterious Super-paopei Kinkouza (Super-paopei help user travel through time). He merged with the life of the planet but he could maintain his human form in short amount of time at power spot (power spot are places where natural energy concentrated so Original People as Shinnou can maintain human form in power spot). After Taikobo had defeated Jyoka, Taikoko found him to ask about dangerous Super-paopei Kinkouza's trace. He showed Super-paopei Kinkouza with Taikobo and Supushan. Suddenly, he sent Taikobo and Shupushan to the past. ; :One of the Original People came to Earth in ancient times. Suijin along with the other Original People battled against Jyoka and put Jyoka in an eternal sleep. After all, Suijin chose to merge with the life of the planet. ; :One of the Original People came to Earth in ancients times. Shukuyuu along with the other Original People battled against Jyoka and put Jyoka in an eternal sleep. After all, Shukuyuu chose to merge with the life of the planet.

The characters sing throughout much of the episode, with the story being told through the lyrics and the way the characters interact during songs. In comparison to other episodes of Inside No. 9, \\"Empty Orchestra\\" is upbeat, features romantic elements, and lacks explicitly bloody or macabre references. The filming experience and resulting episode was a highlight of the series for Pemberton, but raised technical challenges, in part due to simultaneous singing and talking. Television critics had a mixed reaction to the episode. In both The Telegraph and The National, it was characterised as weaker than others in the series. The change in tone divided commentators, some of whom found the setting and constant noise a distraction. The writing and production, however, were praised, while the cast were commended both for their performances and their willingness to embrace the episode's concept. Production The third series of Inside No. 9 was announced in October 2015, and was heavily publicised beginning in January 2016, at which time Sarah Hadland, Javone Prince and Tamzin Outhwaite were named as guest stars in the series. \\"Empty Orchestra\\" was the fourth episode of the series, and the third of a run of five episodes beginning February 2017‚Äîthe series's first episode being the December 2016 Christmas special \\"The Devil of Christmas\\". It was first shown on 7 March 2017, on BBC Two. \\"Empty Orchestra\\"‚Äîthe name of which is a literal translation of the Japanese word karaoke‚Äîwas written by Pemberton and Shearsmith, and was directed by Guillem Morales. It was the last episode of the series to be written, and was filmed on a set constructed at Shepperton Studios. The sides of the set could be removed for filming purposes, but, for the most part, the performers were confined. \\"Empty Orchestra\\" was originally intended as a wholly musical episode. The initial conceit was that the story would be wholly told through song, but this was not possible. For Shearsmith, the reality of this was difficult to maintain; on the episode commentary, Pemberton expressed a wish that there was less dialogue. The closest example to the original intention of storytelling wholly through singing in the final episode was the performance of \\"I Know Him So Well\\". Nonetheless, the resulting episode, for Pemberton, was \\"a kind of musical\\", in that \\"there's music all the way through it\\". While he would be interested in doing \\"a proper La La Land-style musical\\" in the future, \\"Empty Orchestra\\" serves to \\"[tick] that box to some degree\\". The idea of a love story, which is how Pemberton characterised \\"Empty Orchestra\\", was also \\"very appealing\\". Pemberton ultimately chose the episode as his favourite of the series, calling it very different to other episodes of Inside No. 9. At the series launch, speaking in reference to the previous episode \\"The Riddle of the Sphinx\\", Pemberton said that \\"When you‚Äôve cut someone's bum off and eaten it, you kind of go, well, better try something different!\\" One influence on the episode was Shane Meadows's This Is England; Pemberton drew inspiration from the way that characters' enjoyment of music events was portrayed in the film. =Cast and filming= Tamzin Outhwaite (pictured, 2015) starred in \\"Empty Orchestra\\" as Connie, who is in fancy dress as Amy Winehouse. \\"Empty Orchestra\\" stars Pemberton as Roger, who is celebrating a promotion with five colleagues: Greg, played by Shearsmith; Connie, played by Outhwaite; Fran, played by Hadland; Janet, played by Emily Howlett; and Duane, played by Prince. Rebekah Hinds also stars as Chantel. As an anthology series, Inside No. 9 features a new cast each episode, which the writers say re-energises them. During filming, Outhwaite and Hadland said that Pemberton and Shearsmith would not enjoy working with another cast more; the following week, the writers jokingly sent them pictures with Fiona Shaw and Morgana Robinson (who star in \\"Private View\\"), claiming to be having more fun. Howlett, like Janet, is deaf. Unlike Howlett, however, Janet is \\"quite passive, quiet, sweet and generally happy looking after people, especially her boss\\". As Janet sings, Howlett faced a particular acting challenge. She possesses, she explained, \\"very little understanding of what constitutes music, and no idea at all about things like keys, pitch or melody ‚Äì I even struggle with the concept of 'high' and 'low' sounds\\". The song Janet sings‚Äî\\"Only You\\" by Yazoo‚Äîwas particularly challenging. Howlett sought help from the composer John Chambers, with whom she had previously worked, and with his help, learnt the song's rhythm and then placed the lyrics relative to it. Chambers then produced a \\"board of 'tune'\\", with words sung with a high note placed physically higher on the board, and Howlett tried various methods to train herself to sing different pitches. The whole process took a considerable amount of time, but \\"In the end, it paid off, because I got the role. It was one of the best and most welcoming sets I've been on, especially in mainstream filming. I never once felt like a token Deaf, which is rare and beautiful.\\" The writers opted to have the characters in fancy dress to add a layer of visual interest. Outhwaite, Howlett, and Shearsmith expressed their enjoyment of the fancy dress aspect of the episode. Shearsmith initially wore an inflatable sumo suit, but air in the suit produced sounds that interfered with music. The alternative suit was made of foam. Pemberton's character wore a very minimal costume, and Pemberton himself was mostly unchanged; he simply wore glasses and had his hair brushed forward. Outhwaite had long been a fan of Inside No. 9 and the work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, the former of whom she had worked with in an episode of Hotel Babylon. She was particularly pleased to appear alongside Hadland, as the pair are old friends, and characterised her duet with Hadland as her favourite scene. She loved her \\"selfish, sad and manipulative\\" character, Connie. The filming process was, for her, extremely enjoyable and memorable. Pemberton said that Hadland and Outhwaite \\"brought a bubbly energy which injected into the hysteria of that room\\", naming the episode's production his favourite filming experience from the series. Shearsmith pointed to the scene in which \\"a hen party invades the karaoke room and they start singing. The music was pumped up and we had a mini party, with mad dancing ‚Äì that was a memorable scene to film.\\" The filming introduced a number of technical challenges, with the producer Adam Tandy explaining that the simultaneous singing and conversing made production particularly difficult: \\"To record it all 'clean' and have options in the edit, that was technically hard on everybody.\\" Typically, karaoke scenes in television will see characters sing only the opening lines, but because of the format of Inside No. 9, the characters in \\"Empty Orchestra\\" sing the whole song. Each character sang a song, with the vocals recorded live. For technical reasons, the recording of vocals had to be done without a backing track. The actors wore an earpiece to listen to the music while singing; Howlett's, used so that she could feel the beat, was taped under her wig, and she was counted in by Outhwaite. Filming took a week, with days focussed on particular songs. Plot Greg, dressed in a sumo-themed fatsuit, enters a karaoke booth and begins singing The Human League's \\"Don't You Want Me\\". Connie, dressed as Amy Winehouse, arrives; the two kiss, but break apart when Greg's partner Fran (dressed as Britney Spears) enters. Roger arrives with his assistant Janet; Janet, who is deaf, is dressed as Boy George, and Roger, who has no outfit, puts on a clown's nose when prompted. The group are celebrating Roger's promotion and, to Greg's alarm, Roger has an envelope with a list of names. Fran begins singing Whigfield's \\"Saturday Night\\" before Duane, dressed as Michael Jackson, arrives. He has the group play \\"pills roulette\\"; each take either ecstasy, Viagra, ketamine, Paracetamol, a laxative or a Tic Tac. Roger is distracted, soon leaving for more drinks; Greg is keen to know what he has written, believing someone is being laid off. Duane starts Wham!'s \\"Wham Rap!\\"; Janet \\"listens\\" by placing her hand on the speaker, until Greg quizzes her on lay-offs. Connie takes Duane's phone to text Janet, and Roger returns with shots, which he drinks alone. Janet's text from \\"Duane\\" asks her to sing him a song if she likes him. Watched by Janet, Connie tells Greg to make a choice between her and Fran. Roger starts Rainbow's \\"Since You Been Gone\\" and Greg conspires with Connie and Fran to acquire the envelope. Roger, having danced with Connie, is aroused, but Duane says that all the pills were Tic Tacs. Greg finally reaches the envelope, and Fran's name is circled. Roger reveals that the envelope contains divorce papers; his wife is leaving him. Fran sings \\"I Know Him So Well\\" (Elaine Paige and Barbara Dickson), first to Roger and then Greg. She duets with Connie, and, hugging Fran, Greg mouths to Connie that Fran is getting sacked. Connie and Fran, the latter oblivious, sing to each other, as Roger signs his divorce papers. When the song finishes, Roger sombrely talks to Fran. Janet sings Yazoo's \\"Only You\\" to Duane, who stops the music after Fran whispers to him. Chastising Connie, Duane says that he does not like Janet \\"in that way\\". Roger steps in; someone has to be made redundant, but it will be him, and he has recommended that Fran be promoted. A hen do arrives in the booth, and a newcomer, Chantel, begins \\"Titanium\\" (David Guetta and Sia). Watched by Janet, Connie confronts and kisses Greg; Roger meets eyes with a young woman. Connie mocks Janet, who reminds the former that she can lip read. Janet whispers to Fran, who confronts Greg and Connie; UV light reveals Connie's lipstick on Greg's mouth, and Fran tells them that they are both fired. Fran sings with Chantel, Roger dances with the young woman, and Greg and Connie argue. Duane and Janet meet eyes, and Duane places her hand on his chest; she feels his heartbeat as the two kiss. Analysis \\"Empty Orchestra\\" follows a relatively simple narrative of co-workers on a night out, telling several interweaved stories through body language, muffled conversations, and relevant song lyrics. Phil Harrison, writing for The Guardian, characterised the episode as \\"a study in communication breakdown; how people use booze, loud music and enforced jollity to fill the gaps between them\\". Possibilities for macabre developments are seeded early in the episode, but, contrary to viewer expectations, these possibilities are cut off; for example, Duane's \\"pills\\" are merely Tic Tacs, and Roger's list‚Äîas revealed in his \\"David Brentish\\" speech‚Äîhas no sinister purpose. Viewer expectations (and possible criticisms) are anticipated by Pemberton's Roger saying \\"it's not just going to be one song after another, is it?\\" Much of the story is told by the songs, with the lyrics coordinating with the events of the story. For example, \\"Don't You Want Me\\" introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line \\"we will both be sorry\\"; this is unsung, but nonetheless emphasised. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing \\"don't you want me?\\" when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including \\"Don't forget it's me who put you where you are now // And I can put you back there too\\". Reception \\"Empty Orchestra\\" had a mixed reception from television critics, being awarded four out of five by Mark Ward of the Daily Express, three out of five by Ben Lawrence of the Daily Telegraph, and two out of five by the freelance journalist Dan Owen, who claimed that he \\"never warmed to\\" the episode, but considered it nonetheless worth watching. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau called it \\"a hit\\", and Mark Butler, of i, offered a positive review of an episode that, for him, \\"ended up being a down-to-earth, relatable and ultimately feel-good slice of drama\\". Many critics characterised it as weaker than other episodes of Inside No. 9, though both Julie McDowall (The National) and Lawrence stressed the quality of the programme overall, emphasising that \\"Empty Orchestra\\" was still commendable. The more upbeat story was \\"a refreshingly restrained change of pace for the show\\" for Butler, and possessed its \\"own charm\\" for Owen. Butler wrote that \\"some will have no doubt been disappointed\\" by the lack of a bloody climax, but that \\"variety in tone and story is what helps make Inside No. 9 work so well. You can't begrudge it a happy, straightforward ending every now and then.\\" The episode's plot and production were praised. For Mellor, \\"In barely any time at all, we'd been told a complete story that was satisfying, romantic and unexpectedly uplifting.\\" Owen, similarly, argued that the episode \\"achieved what it wanted to, ending with a fantastic reveal [concerning UV lights] and each of the storylines were resolved quite nicely\\", though Lawrence felt that the \\"twist\\" involving Janet's ability to lip-read was \\"obvious\\". Patrick Mulkern (Radio Times) commended the production, and the inclusion of Janet, while Phil Harrison (The Guardian) called the episode an \\"object lesson in economical narrative\\". Mellor summarised the strength of the production and writing by saying that the elements \\"slotted in with real efficiency. Seeding the UV light early on provided a satisfying pay-off, and the shifts to Janet's aural point of view, along with the use of subtitles and director Guillem Morales' continually inventive shifts in [point of view], kept things varied and lively.\\" Nonetheless, she considered the costumes a missed opportunity, perceiving no meaning behind the choices. The episode's greatest achievement, for Mellor, was the \\"lyrical cleverness\\". A number of commentators were critical of the choice of setting. Though Lawrence claimed that it \\"illustrated how good Pemberton and Shearsmith are at creating maximum tension on a minimal budget\\", others found that it interfered with their enjoyment of the episode. For Owen, it \\"offered a definite production challenge that was made to look effortless ... but an appreciation of how well something was made isn't enough\\". Similarly, Lawrence felt that \\"amid the karaoke din, it was hard to get a proper handle on the characters or, indeed, really care about their fates\\". While Owen did not consider the episode funny, Mellor called Roger's song \\"(tragi) comedy gold to match the farcical comedy of Greg's perpetually thwarted heist attempts\\". Lawrence described the characterisation as \\"painted with the broadest of brush strokes, but that suited the super- annuated, hypercharged nature of the plot and the faintly camp dialogue\\", praising Pemberton in particular. The guest stars were praised for their willingness to support the episode's concept. Dessau picked out Outhwaite's performance as particularly strong; both Mulkern and Lawrence praised Howlett, with Mulkern saying that she put him \\"in mind of a young Victoria Wood and the sympathetic women she used to bring to life\\".

Morgan, 346 U.S. 502 (1954), is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court which provides the writ of coram nobis as the proper application to request federal post-conviction judicial review for those who have completed the conviction's incarceration. Background The ancient writ of coram nobis originated in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century. If a court discovered a factual mistake or error after the conclusion of a case, the writ could be issued by the court to correct the error. The writ of coram nobis was identical to the writ of habeas corpus; except, the writ of habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the writ of coram nobis was available to everyone else.. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided courts in the United States the authority to issue writs to achieve justice as long as the writ does not conflict with constitutional rights or legislative statutes.Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 81-82 In 1911, the authorization of the federal judiciary to issue writs was modified into 28 U. S. C. ¬ß 1651(a) and is known as the ‚Äúall-writs section of the Judicial Code‚Äù.. In 1946, the writ of coram nobis was considered obsolete when Congress added Rule 60(e) to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases. Until this time, federal courts only used the writ of coram nobis to correct errors in federal civil cases because errors in federal criminal cases could be corrected with a writ of habeas corpus. Thus, in its 1947 decision, United States v. Smith, the Supreme Court observed ‚Äúit is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate.‚Äù United States v. Smith, n.4 (1947). Questions about whether the writ of coram nobis would be necessary or appropriate resurfaced just one year later with the Act of June 25, 1948 which codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and provided only those individuals in-custody access to the writ of habeas corpus.Act of June 25, 1948 Prior to the Act of June 25, 1948, the writ of habeas corpus was the sole application for United States federal courts to review convictions of those who had completed their incarceration. Following the Act of June 25, 1948, federal courts were left to decide whether the act eliminated any review of convictions for those who had completed their incarceration or whether the writ of coram nobis (which had been limited to reviews of civil cases in US federal courts) could be expanded to include reviews of criminal cases for those who had completed their incarceration. Morgan resolved these questions by determining that those who had completed their incarceration could challenge their conviction through the writ of coram nobis. Although the Supreme Court states in Carlisle v. United States, ‚Äúit is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate [for prisoners and others serving out a term of a federal conviction],‚Äù. Morgan provides when the writ of coram nobis is necessary or appropriate for those who are no longer in- custody. Case In 1939, nineteen-year-old Robert Patrick Morgan pled guilty to stealing three letters from the US Post Office and was sentenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to four years in federal prison; however, Morgan's constitutional rights were violated because he was not provided an attorney nor did he waive his constitutional right to an attorney. Unfortunately for Morgan, he was unaware that his constitutional rights were violated until after he had completed his sentence. In 1950, Morgan was convicted of attempted burglary in a New York county court. As a result of his 1939 federal conviction, the county court applied New York's Multiple Offenders Law and sentenced Morgan to seven to ten years at Attica Prison. In 1952, Morgan first became aware of the constitutional violations related to his 1939 federal conviction. As a result, he petitioned the district court for the writ of coram nobis. If successful, his state sentence would be reduced because he would no longer be considered a multiple offender. The district court denied Morgan's petition on the ground that the coram nobis petition was to be treated as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2255, which was unavailable to Morgan because he was no longer in federal custody. Morgan appealed the district court's decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The case was argued before the appellate court on January 13, 1953. On February 5, 1953, the three-judge panel unanimously determined that Morgan was entitled to the writ of coram nobis and reversed the district court's decision.United States v. Morgan, Following the appellate court's decision, the attorney's office for the United States petitioned and was granted a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.United States v. Morgan, . Decision In a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.United States v. Morgan was argued on October 19, 1953 and decided January 4, 1954. In a 5-4 decision, the Court agreed with the Second Circuit and held that federal courts have the authority under the all-writs section of the Judicial Code to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.United States v. Morgan, . Justice Stanley Reed wrote for the majority in Morgan, which held: * Federal District Courts, under the authority of the All-Writs Section, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1651(a), may issue the writ of coram nobis.Morgan, 346 U.S. at 506-510. * A motion for a writ of coram nobis ‚Äúis a step in the criminal case‚Äù and ‚Äúis of the same general character as a motion under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2255.‚ÄùMorgan, 346 U.S. at 505, n.4. * A writ of coram nobis should be allowed only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice.Morgan, 346 U.S. at 511. * If no other remedy is available and sound reasons existing for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief, a motion of the writ of coram nobis must be heard by the federal court.Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512. * Since adverse consequences resulting from the conviction persist after conclusion of a sentence, the petitioner is entitled to show that his conviction was invalid.Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512-13. * The writ of coram nobis may be issued to correct a constitutional violation. Thus, Morgan broadened the writ of coram nobis, which had historically been issued only to correct errors of fact, to allow courts to also correct errors of law. Division of circuit courts Map of the United States Courts of Appeals Federal appellate courts are currently divided on the deadline to file an appeal of a district court's decision of a case to petition for a writ of coram nobis. Most appellate courts provide 60 days to file an appeal; two other courts provide only 10 days to file an appeal. The source of this controversy is found in footnote 4 of the Morgan decision in which the Court held the writ of coram nobis ‚Äúis a step in the criminal case‚Äù and also ‚Äúof the same general character as one under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2255.‚Äù The Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth circuit courts held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis is \\"of the same general character\\" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal.Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1) However, the Eighth and Ninth circuit courts held that a writ of coram nobis is governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals because it a \\"step in a criminal case.\\" Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.United States v.

Ay≈üe is known for her many politically motivated marriages. Life =Birth= Born in Constantinople, Ay≈üe Sultan was one of Ahmed's daughters by his favourite consort K√∂sem Sultan. Her birth date is variously estimated as 1605, 1606, or 1608. When mentioning her and Nasuh Pasha's 1612 wedding, 17th-century historian Mustafa Naima refers to Ay≈üe as \\"the youngest of the princesses\\". =Marriages= The Ottoman princesses were normally married away, to influential Ottoman officials, by their mothers or paternal grandmothers, who had the right to arrange their marriages and arranged matches which could be of political use. They had privileges in marriage which separated them from other Muslim females: such as the right to be the only wife of their spouse, to refuse to consummate their marriage until they were ready, and to contract a divorce when they pleased. Due to many of them marrying as children and being widowed and divorced several times, often for political reasons, remarriages were very common. Ay≈üe and her sister, Fatma Sultan are extreme examples of this: they were married at least seven and six times, and entered into their last engagement at the ages of about 50 and 61, respectively. Of the total number of Ay≈üe's husbands, two were executed, one was assassinated and two fell in battle. Ay≈üe Sultan was married firstly in 1612 to G√ºm√ºlcineli Nasuh Pasha (d. 1614), Grand Vizier 1611‚Äì14. The celebrations of their engagement and wedding ceremonies, as well as those of her sister Gevherhan Sultan and √ñk√ºz Kara Mehmed Pasha, which took place in succession over a number of months of 1611 and 1612, were sponsored by Ahmed, and were so elaborate and extravagant that they were observed by the public as if they were festivals marking the end of wars the Sultan had promised. In July of the latter year, the little princess was taken in great pomp to her husband's palace, where he would eventually be executed in her presence, much to her distress. This palace, located opposite the quay known as Salacak in √úsk√ºdar, she retained as her own property.Evliya Celebi. The Intimate Life of an Ottoman Statesman Albany: State University of New York, 1991. P.134. While still a child, Ay≈üe was married secondly to Karaka≈ü Mehmed Pasha (d. 1621), Beylerbey (governor-general) of Buda. However the man soon died while fighting in Osman II's military campaign against Poland, the marriage thus lasting less than a year. In 1626 her mother K√∂sem Sultan offered her hand in marriage to Hafƒ±z Ahmed Pasha (1564‚Äì 10 February 1632), Grand Vizier 1625‚Äì26, 1631‚Äì32; she wed the sixty-year-old man either in the same year or on 13 March 1627. Only a month after the murder of Hafiz Pasha during a Janissary revolt against her brother Murad IV, Ay≈üe was betrothed to Murtaza Pasha (d. 1636), beylerbey of Diyarbekir and Vizier, the nuptials though not being held until his arrival at the imperial capitol of Constantinople in 1635. This old and ailing husband she strongly disliked, according to Venetian reports, died ‚Äì thus saving her from a unhappy life ‚Äì during Murad's military campaign against Revan, which took place in the course of the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì39). She was next married in 1639 to Ahmed Pasha (d.1644), beylerbey of Aleppo and Damascus, and in March 1645 to Voynuk Ahmed Pasha (d. 28 July 1649), beylerbey of Adana, Vizier, Admiral of the Fleet12/22 June 1648 ‚Äì 28 July 1649. In 1643, early in the reign of her brother Ibrahim \\"the Mad\\", Ay≈üe is recorded, like her sisters Fatma Sultan and Hanzade Sultan, as receiving the maximum daily stipend for imperial princesses of the time, namely 400 aspers; yet, later, in circa 1647, the three of them as well as their niece, Murad's daughter Kaya Sultan, were subjected, on what was another assault of the protocol on Ibrahim's part, to the indignity of subordination to his concubines. He took away their lands and jewels (presumably to award them to his Hasekis), and made them serve H√ºma≈üah Sultan, the concubine he married, by standing at attention like servants while she ate and fetching and holding the soap, basin and pitcher of water with which she washed her hands. Because of what he believed was failure to serve his beloved H√ºma≈üah properly, the Sultan then banished them to Edirne Palace. Some five or six years after Voynuk Ahmed Pasha died in battle, by rifle fire, during the Cretan War (1645‚Äì69), in 1654 or 1655, Ay≈üe was betrothed to rebel Ib≈üir Mustafa Pasha (d. 11 May 1655). Thanks to her appeal Mustafa Pasha was given the post of Grand Vizier. She apparently anxiously awaited her intended husband's arrival ‚Äì which he delayed for months Evliya Celebi. The Intimate Life of an Ottoman Statesman Albany: State University of New York, 1991. P.146. ‚Äì for she dispatched several emissaries to bring him to the capitol. Her head servant, Mercan Aƒüa, finally succeeded in the task, and when Ib≈üir and his troops reached her palace in √úsk√ºdar she treated him and the statesmen that had come to receive him to a great banquet,Evliya Celebi.

Their wedding took place on 28 February 1655. Their life together was short, ending upon his execution. Death Ay≈üe Sultan most probably died in or around 1656‚Äì1657. She was entombed in her father Sultan Ahmed I's mausoleum in Sultan Ahmed Mosque.

From 1841 it was the site of a very productive MƒÅori mission station until the Invasion of the Waikato in 1864. The station served Ngati Hinetu and Ngati Apakura. Only a church remains from those days, the second oldest Waikato building.  History  In 1851 Rangiaowhia was described as, \\"About a thousand acres‚Äî soon greatly to be added to . . . under cultivation. . . A very numerous population of natives engaged in industry and agriculture. . . in a few years will be the granary of Auckland. . . The whole scene reminds one of English farms. Yellow cornfields bound the horizon ; orchards cluster round the houses. The mill, the flail, the plough, the spade, are seldom idle. . . the village bell calls to church or school. cultivating and rendering fruitful the wild wastes of their district,‚Äî accumulating guarantees for the continuance of peace, ‚Äî in all ways setting an example to their countrymen . . . I sincerely trust that many Rangiaowhias,‚Äî such remarkable instances of the progress of the Maori race,‚Äî may soon be found throughout New Zealand.\\" In 1852 the village was described as two miles long and with a population of about 700. An 1857 letter suggests that the area was divided between 14 hap≈´, who had converted their 'waste' lands to agriculture. Immediately prior to invasion in 1864, magistrate, John Eldon Gorst, wrote, \\"The land around Rangiaowhia and Te Awamutu, extending to and including part of Kihikihi, belongs to natives of the great Waikato tribe. . . Besides the great villages of Rangiaowhia, Kihikihi, and Kuakotari, numerous little hamlets are dotted about the country, consisting of three or four native houses surrounded by their patches of cultivated land. Even those parts of the country which appear to be only a barren waste of heavy fern land would be found, on enquiry, to have been once under cultivation, and to be now used as a pasturage for horses, cattle, or pigs . . . Rangiaowhia, for instance, is surrounded by a fence many miles in circuit; roads are made in various directions ; bridges have been thrown over impassible swamps; and a good many mill-dams have been constructed. A considerable part of the land was covered, a generation ago, with ancient forest, which the industry of the Waikatos has cleared.\\" = Churches = St Paul's church, with Maungatautari in the distance St Paul's Church was built in Gothic Revival style in 1852‚Äì1856 as part of the Church Missionary Society station, replacing a raupo chapel. It and the slightly earlier St John's, Te Awamutu are the oldest surviving Waikato buildings. It initially consisted of a bell tower, nave and chancel. The chancel has 2 stained glass windows, depicting St Paul's encounter with a magician. They were brought from Britain by Bishop Selwyn in 1855 and thought to have been donated by Lady Burdett Coutts. Missionary teacher, Taati Te Waru, added a steeple around 1857. The church sheltered MƒÅori during the Imperial forces attack and was then empty until repaired in the 1870s as a parish church and school. It continues to be used for services. The Catholic Holy Angels mission station was about 400 metres north of St Paul's. Father Jean Pezant relocated it there from Matamata in 1844. In 1850 he was succeeded by Father Joseph Garavel. Part of the mission station burnt down in an accidental fire in 1865. The church was demolished in 1931. The cemetery remains, with a memorial pou erected in 2015. The bishop's house was across the valley, to the east. = School = Both Anglican and Catholic missions had schools. Rev. John Morgan ran an Anglican school with over 40 pupils, charging ¬£5 a year for board and tuition in English, singing, industry and religion. In May 1860 Father Garaval had 24 boys in the school when he left due to the war. In 1876 the school had only one girl attending. = Crops = Shortly after Rev Morgan took over Otawhao (Te Awamutu) mission station in 1841, wheat was grown there and, next year, also at Rangiaowhia. Soon Rangiaowhia wheat fields covered some . Other crops were barley, oats, potatoes, peach, apple, pear, plum, quince, gooseberry and almond. Cows were also milked and pigs sold in Auckland. A blacksmith maintained the ploughs and other implements. extract of Rangiaowhia area on 1864 military map showing Pekapekarau mill = Mills = In March 1846 a ¬£200 contract (excluding carriage of timber and building the dam and leat) with Stewart McMullen to erect a mill was started. The mill started grinding in 1847. Its scoria millstone came from Mt Eden. By 1848 Rangiaowhia flour was sold in Auckland for about ¬£70 and, in later years, reached about ¬£330. The 1846 mill was at Pekapekarau (or Perepekerau on another 1865 map), in the valley to the west, between Hairini and Rangiaowhia. A replacement mill was built between 1851 and 1855 for ¬£400 on Te Rua-o-Tawhiwhi stream, to the east of Rangiaowhia. Both streams feed the Mangapiko Stream, one of the Waipa's tributaries. There were also mills at most of the surrounding settlements. Governor Grey visited the mill in 1849 and was presented with 2 bags of flour for Queen Victoria. He also spent half a day at Rangiaowhia in 1857, In the gold rushes of 1849‚Äì52, Rangiaowhia flour was often shipped to San Francisco and Melbourne. = Invasion = thumb P≈çtatau was installed as King at Rangiaowhia in 1858, after which it became a target for government control. To guard against this the roads to Rangiaowhia were defended by new pas at Paterangi and Rangiatea (near Te Rahu, north of Te Awamutu). However, General Cameron, in his Invasion of the Waikato, avoided them by taking nearly 1,000 troops overnight from Te Rore via Waiari, just avoiding Paterangi to the north, and Te Awamutu. There were about 200 of Ngati-Apakura and Ngati-Hinetu at Rangiaowhia, supplying food to the garrisons at the pas. At dawn on 21 February 1864 the troops attacked. Most people fled, a few shot at the troops, some sheltered in the churches, 7 were burnt in their whare and at least one attempted to surrender, but was murdered by troops ignoring their orders. About a dozen houses were burned down. 12 MƒÅori were killed and over 30 taken prisoner. As the village was largely occupied by women, children and older men, the deaths have been regarded as murder, rather than an act of war. The role of Bishop Selwyn is also unclear. He came with the invading forces, but also helped with MƒÅori burials. Later that day Paterangi, Pikopiko, and Rangiatea pas were deserted, in favour of digging a rifle-trench with a narrow opening to block the road from Te Awamutu on the crest of the ridge at Hairini. Next morning, the 22nd, the cavalry advanced on Hairini, backed by artillery and foot soldiers. 3 soldiers and about 20 MƒÅori died, though the numbers are disputed. The troops then looted the village, though it has been suggested that the Hairini defence was a diversionary tactic, to allow more time to move more goods and animals south to safety. However, enough was left for looting to continue for at least a month after the invasion. The 150th anniversary was commemorated in 2014 with the unveiling of a plaque. = Redoubt = A 200-man redoubt was built later in February, in what is now the Hall domain, formerly a school. In the 1870s a blockhouse was added, manned by the Armed Constabulary.  Post 1864  Within a month of the invasion, the William Fox government issued a proclamation that rebels who surrendered would get some of their land back, but those who didn't would have their land confiscated. By 1868 there was concern at the resentment the takeover by military settlers was causing. The church was restored in 1875. Rangiaowhia riding was formed as one of 5 ridings in Waipa county in 1876, with Puniu River as its southern boundary. A state school near the hall ran from 1874 to 1939, when several schools were amalgamated into an expanded Te Awamutu school. The school house of about 1900 remains, as does the hall, built on the domain in 1907.

He is also known for his role in the 2014 Venezuelan protests. Early life Around the time of his birth, Pizarro's family moved to the state of T√°chira, where he lived until he was four years old. They then moved back to the same area as before ‚Äî barrio 24 de Julio ‚Äî where Miguel spent much of his young life. He was part of a punk band called Kolumpio when he was a student.  Political formation  From the age of 13 Pizarro participated in political activism, coming from a family with a political activist tradition. His father was of the political left militia from the 1970s, and was a trade union activist and at one point imprisoned in . His mother was one of the founders of the Committee in Defense of Human Rights for political prisoners, and was secretary to the fraction of left parties of the Senate. During his youth, Pizarro subscribed to anarchism, particularly to the ideas of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin akin to anarco-punk. In high school, he founded the antimilitarist movement \\"Ni casco ni uniforme\\" (English: \\"Without helmet or uniform\\"), which opposed the government's implementation of military education in secondary education establishments. Due to his protests, he was expelled from the Franciscan school he was studying at.  2007 student movement  In 2007, Pizarro started and participated in the protests of the Movimiento Estudiantil (English: \\"The Student Movement\\"), with other future politicians like Freddy Guevara, Juan Requesens, Juan Guaid√≥, Yon Goicoechea , Eduardo Massieu and Manuela Bol√≠var when he was a student leader at the Central University of Venezuela, protesting the closure of the television channel RCTV. He also played an active part in the campaign against the intended Ch√°vez-implemented 2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum. National Assembly Pizarro in the National Assembly in 2013 Pizarro was elected as a deputy in the 2010 Venezuelan parliamentary election at age 21, supported by the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD), when he was a member of the Progressive Advance party. He represented the second district of T√°chira as the alternate representative for deputy Gabino Paz. In 2015, he worked on the enactment of the Special Law against Violence in Sports Events, approved in its first discussion. This sought to eradicate the acts of violence in the massive sporting events of the country, especially after the shooting murder of a fan during a football match between the teams Deportivo Lara and Portuguesa F.C. in November 2014. Pizarro has strongly criticized the inefficiency of the National Assembly in resolving the problems it acknowledges as affecting the Venezuelan population. In numerous interviews he has highlighted the need to focus on solving the problems that affect the people, instead of wasting time in political rhetoric discussion with little results: Pizarro is a member of the Commission for Social Development, where he has promoted legislation such as the Organic Law on Sports ‚Äî the first law passed by consensus in its legislative period, having the approval of the Venezuelan Olympic Committee, unions, athletes, and professional leagues ‚Äî and the Law for the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Equality, for people with HIV/AIDS and their relatives. =Reelection as deputy = On 24 June 2015, the MUD announced its candidates for the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election. On 6 December that year, Pizarro was reelected with 64.9% of the vote in the third district of Miranda state, the parish of Petare. Some of the members of his campaign had been attacked by colectivos on 22 November. =Presidency of the Commission for Social Development = During the legislative year 2016, Pizarro was the president of the National Assembly's Commission for Social Development. Among the laws he promoted there were the Law of Bond for Food and Medicines for Pensioners and the Retired the Law of Guarantee of School Meals, and the Law of Recognition and Protection for People with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Similar Conditions. Human rights activism Pizarro during the 2017 Venezuelan protests Pizarro has worked for the cause of human rights for many years, and especially in the case of those detained in the protests in Venezuela that started in 2014, working with their families to seek a just trial for them. Although not supporting violent protests, he gave his voice to the cause of removing the government of Nicol√°s Maduro, saying he respected those who criticized Maduro. Pizarro spoke openly to demand respect in the parliamentary debates related to the murder in 2014 of Robert Serra, a young lawyer and National Assembly deputy, by the PSUV ‚Äî the party to which Pizarro is opposed. Likewise, he demanded to bring to justice the authors of the crime, also demanding repudiation of all violence and its supporters. In November 2016, after Venezuela received Universal Periodic Review documentation denouncing its ignorance towards Human Rights, Pizarro was the deputy who took on the leadership role to disseminate responsibilities to appropriate commissions.

It burned down the next year, and the architect Isaiah Rogers was contracted to rebuild the school. The result, the current building in modified Renaissance Revival style, was completed in 1857. The school later came to be known as the Monsarrat School, after its first principal, Laura Lucas Monsarrat. The Fifth Ward School would serve three hundred children annually. During the Civil War it served as a hospital. During World War II, the building became a dormitory for soldiers. From 1937 to 1951, the Monsarrat School was used to operate the Free Public Library and Museum, on loan from the Board of Education. This was due to the flood of 1937 that damaged the Louisville Free Public Library building. The museum was located on the first floor. Visitors had to pack into the small museum location until a new one could be afforded. On May 20, 1940, the library on York Street reopened; however, the museum continued on at the Monsarrat for another 37 years.

As the name suggests, this subpopulation in the blood is characterized by a shared unique mutation in the cells' DNA; it is thought that this subpopulation is \\"clonally\\" derived from a single founding cell and is therefore made of genetic \\"clones\\" of the founder. The establishment of a clonal population may occur when a stem or progenitor cell acquires one or more somatic mutations that give it a competitive advantage in hematopoiesis over the stem/progenitor cells without these mutations. Alternatively, clonal hematopoiesis may arise without a driving mutation, through mechanisms such as neutral drift in the stem cell population. Clonal hematopoiesis may occur in people who are completely healthy but has also been found in people with hematologic diseases. The clonal population may vary in size depending on the person, where it can be less than 2% of the blood or, at the other end, can sometimes grow close to 100%. The incidence of clonal hematopoiesis has been found to rise dramatically with age. Recent studies have demonstrated that less than 1% of the population under age 40 but approximately 10-20% of the population over age 70 has observable clonal hematopoiesis. Having clonal hematopoiesis has been linked to a more than 10-fold increased risk of developing a blood cancer, though the overall likelihood is still low. Clonal hematopoiesis does not typically give rise to noticeable symptoms, but does lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. History The first major evidence for the existence of prevalent clonal hematopoiesis in healthy people was put forth in the 1990s. Using the HUMARA assay, scientists found that there was nonrandom X-inactivation of the X chromosome in the blood of some healthy women. This means that a greater than expected proportion of the blood had the silencing of one specific X chromosome in the chromosome pair. Just as the observation of the same DNA mutation in a subset of cells suggests a single founding source, this X-inactivation skew suggests that a greater than expected number of cells are being generated from the same precursor. Importantly, these findings described an increase in this nonrandom skewing with increasing age, hinting that unobserved mutations acquired with age could be driving a clonal expansion. In a similar vein, other studies using the HUMARA technology had found that hematologic malignancies are clonal diseases even when there is no apparent chromosomal abnormality, and that there are pre-leukemic clonal populations which precede acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As the HUMARA assay is based on the epigenetic state of cells, the underlying genetic determinants of the clonal expansion remained to be uncovered. This set of evidence led to the suggestion in 2005 that driving mutations in leukemia are acquired in a step- wise manner. This model has received support from studies showing subpopulations of blood cells harboring initiating but not late somatic mutations in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and AML. The combination of these two ideas, that clonal hematopoiesis might be common in the elderly population and that AML evolves from pre-leukemic populations, led to the hypothesis that malignancy- associated mutations could also contribute to asymptomatic clonal hematopoiesis in healthy individuals. This view gained mechanistic support in 2012 when it was found a number of the women who showed evidence for clonal hematopoiesis through X-inactivation skew also had mutations in the hematologic-malignancy-associated gene TET2. Recently, several independent studies have confirmed the presence of malignancy-associated mutations in the blood of individuals who have no clinical signs of hematologic malignancy. In combination, these studies have demonstrated the widespread incidence of clonal hematopoiesis in the healthy adult population and have stimulated further efforts to broaden our understanding of clonal hematopoiesis in health and disease. Population genetics The advent of next-generation DNA sequencing has allowed for the targeted identification of somatic mutations involved in clonal hematopoiesis at the population level. The studies undertaken as of 2017 are largely consistent in their main findings. One common finding has been that observable clonal hematopoiesis is virtually absent from the under-40 population, with a sharp uptick in frequency past 60 years of age. Indeed, the evidence from these studies suggests that between 10% and 20% of the population over age 70 have clonal hematopoiesis. In the U.S. alone, this means that, at the low end, some 2,975,000 seniors over 70 years of age are living with this condition. Number of people estimated to be affected by clonal hematopoiesis out of the total U.S. population, by age group. The other main common finding is that there are many different mutations involved in clonal hematopoiesis. Many of these fall into the categories of epigenetic regulators (DNMT3a, TET2, and ASXL1), signaling proteins (JAK2), spliceosome components (SF3B1 and SRSF2), or members of the DNA damage response (TP53 and PPM1D). Many people identified as having clonal hematopoiesis have a mutation in a single gene, though a significant number have mutations in two or more genes. The number and variety of observed mutations suggests that these mutations may contribute to clonal hematopoiesis by several distinct mechanisms, discussed in more detail below. There is also limited evidence suggesting clonal hematopoiesis may be ubiquitous in healthy adults, albeit at extremely low levels (less than 0.1% of peripheral blood cells). A study employing the ultra-sensitive digital droplet PCR method found that 95% of studied individuals (19 out of 20) between the ages of 50 and 70 had at least low-level clonal hematopoiesis. This finding does not necessarily conflict with earlier reports that clonal hematopoisis is not ubiquitous in this age bracket, as these previous studies' experimental designs compels the use of a higher threshold to identify legitimate clonal hematopoiesis. As of 2017, there is little known about which, if any, genetic and epidemiological factors may influence the acquisition of mutations in clonal hematopoiesis. One study found that there was a strong association between smoking and clonal hematopoiesis. However, as this result was obtained in a diagnosis-specific all-Swedish cohort, it is unclear how generalizable this result will ultimately be. Biology Clonal hematopoiesis is thought to originate with the hematopoietic stem cells that make blood. An adult human has approximately 10,000 to 20,000 HSCs. The fact that these cells are maintained for life and each HSC may acquire about one mutation in a protein-coding exon each decade means that an elderly individual will have a certain amount of genetic mosaicism, or a variety of cells with different unique mutations, within their HSC population. However, this does not lead to clonal hematopoiesis in all cases. It is only when the genetic mutation confers a selective advantage on its host or there is another favorable stem cell dynamic that there is a clonal expansion. = Candidate driver mutations = There are several general mechanisms by which a mutation could provide such an advantage and it is likely that the mutations found in clonal hematopoiesis act through different pathways. First, a mutation could provide a growth advantage, causing HSCs to divide more rapidly and contribute a larger proportion of the mature blood cells. This may be the case for mutations in genes related to signaling, such as that which causes the activating V617F substitution in the JAK2 signaling protein. Mutations in the DNA damage response genes would appear more likely to act via a second mechanism: allowing for HSC survival and proliferation under normally lethal cytotoxic stress. Other mechanisms are more likely to be associated with the disruption of epigenetic regulators, which comprises 80% of observed mutations in clonal hematopoiesis. A third potential mechanism of action is that the mutation makes the HSC-derived progenitor cells less able to differentiate into mature blood cells. This would allow these cells to continue to divide even after they would have normally stopped, since progenitor cells may divide whereas normal mature blood cells cannot. A fourth possibility is that the mutation makes the progenitor cells and cells derived from them more like stem cells in their ability to keep dividing. The previous two possibilities are very similar in terms of physiologic outcome and mainly differ on what is happening at the DNA level: whether differentiation genes are suppressed or a stem cell program is upregulated. A final possibility is that a gradient of epigenetic states is created in the HSC and progenitor cells and the cells with the most favorable epigenetics are able to grow out faster than unmutated cells. = Non-candidate-driver mechanisms = An expansion of blood cells from a single source does not necessarily require a mutation to act as the driving force. A large proportion of the population who exhibit clonal hematopoiesis have no identifiable mutations in known candidate driver genes. One possible explanation is that among a naturally-occurring specturm of inheritable epigenetic states, there are those which augment the self-renewal or proliferation of a stem cell and its progeny. Another explanation is that a process of neutral drift causes the predominance of a clonal stem cell population over time. In this scenario, all stem cells have an equal proliferative potential but some of them die out in a stochastic manner leading some of the remaining cells to proliferate to replace them. This can be equated to a game of chance where all players start with the same odds of winning. As the game is played, winners and losers will arise despite the equal starting positions. Implications for human health Clonal hematopoiesis by itself is not considered to be a hematologic cancer; nevertheless, evidence is mounting that this condition may adversely affect human health. It has been proposed to label the group of individuals who have clonal hematopoiesis defined by a mutation in a malignancy-associated gene but without evidence of disease (such as cytopenia, dysplasia or immature ‚Äúblast‚Äù cells in the bone marrow) as having Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP). A clonal involvement (sometimes referred to simply as the size of a ‚Äúclone‚Äù) of 2% of the blood has been tentatively proposed as a cutoff, though there is discussion that a lower floor that is more inclusive could also be appropriate. This cutoff may ultimately depend on whether clones must reach a certain size before influencing health. The level at which a clone begins to have a potential clinical impact is an open question, though there is already data to suggest larger clones have a larger effect on health. The presence of clonal hematopoiesis/CHIP has been shown to increase blood cancer risk and is correlated with an increased risk of mortality overall. This is true both of clonal hematopoiesis with known candidate drivers as well as in cases without such drivers. = Blood cancer risk = One area of health that CHIP has been definitively shown to influence is the risk of progression to blood cancer. In a given year, a tiny fraction of the general population will develop a hematologic cancer such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or AML; it is estimated that just 3 to 4 people per 100,000 will get MDS in a given year, and 4 people per 100,000 will develop AML. With CHIP, the risk of acquiring a hematologic malignancy like MDS or AML is increased more than 10-fold. Despite this increased risk, people with CHIP are still at low overall risk for developing a blood cancer, with only about 0.5-1.0% transformation per year. = Cardiovascular risk = A second area of health that may be affected by CHIP is the risk for heart attack and stroke. A strong association between CHIP and heart attack/ischemic stroke has been identified in one human genetic dataset, where CHIP was a stronger predictor of heart attack/stroke than if a patient 1) was a smoker, 2) had hypertension, 3) had high cholesterol, or 4) was overweight. In this study, which shows correlation but not causation, people with CHIP were 2.3 times more likely to suffer a heart attack, or 4.4 times as likely if the variant allele frequency in their blood was greater than 0.10, than matched controls without CHIP. It has also been found that there is an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients who exhibit CHIP and receive self-derived stem cell transplantation. The idea of CHIP having a causal role in human heart attacks/strokes has been given support by a 2017 study that showed impairment of the Tet2 CHIP gene in mice causally led to accelerated atherosclerosis, and this finding in mice has been independently validated. The possibility of somatic mutations in the blood contributing not only to cancer risk but also to heart attack and stroke has generated much discussion in top-level scientific publications and a large multi-cohort study published in 2017 appears to confirm the causal link between CHIP and cardiovascular disease in humans. = Comorbidities = In addition to its effects on those who would otherwise be considered healthy, CHIP may have implications in certain disease contexts. It has been shown that patients with CHIP who receive autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as part of their treatment for lymphoma have worse outcomes than patients without CHIP. The poorer prognosis for these patients is due to both an increase in subsequent therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. = Treatment = There are currently no therapies for slowing or targeting CHIP mutations. Together with the fact that progression from CHIP to outright hematologic malignancy remains infrequent, medical experts have argued against preemptive screening for CHIP but suggest routine follow-up for incidental CHIP findings. Associated disorders Clonal hematopoiesis is sometimes compared to the unrelated blood disorders of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) to which it bears similarities in its apparent priming for more advanced hematologic disease combined with a lack of symptoms and overall low risk of progression. The acquisition of additional mutations can cause CHIP to transform into the related blood disorders MDS and AML.

It has a rosette of leaves and up to ten green and brown flowers with a brown, insect-like labellum. It is widespread and locally common in New South Wales and Victoria, growing mostly in drier forests. Description Pterostylis aciculiformis, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a rosette of between five and twelve leaves at the base of the flowering spike, each leaf long and wide. Up to twelve green and brown flowers long and wide are borne on a flowering spike tall. Three to six stem leaves are wrapped around the flowering spike. The dorsal sepal and petals form a hood over the column with the dorsal sepal having an upturned point about long. The lateral sepals turn downwards, curve forwards and are narrower than the hood. They have thread-like tips long and are more or less parallel to each other. The labellum is brown, fleshy and insect-like, about long and wide. The \\"head\\" end is swollen, there are 6 to 12 white bristles on each side and many short bristles on the \\"tail\\" end. Flowering occurs from September to December. Taxonomy and naming The needle-point rustyhood was first formally described in 1936 by William Nicholls who gave it the name Pterostylis pusilla var. aciculiformis and published the description in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1989, Mark Clements and David Jones raised it to species status. The specific epithet (aciculiformis) is derived from the Latin word acicula meaning \\"a small pin\\" and the suffix -formis. Distribution and habitat Pterostylis aciculiformis occurs in disjunct populations south from Wellington in New South Wales and across northern Victoria, growing mostly in drier forests in stony soils. It may also occur in far eastern South Australia.

Five women (Alex Morgan, Hope Solo, Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, and Becky Sauerbrunn) who were members of the United States women's national soccer team filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accusing the United States Soccer Federation of wage discrimination in April 2016. Separately, the Women's National Team Players Association filed a complaint in U.S. District court seeking to void an extension of its collective bargaining agreement with the United States Soccer Federation through the end of 2016. On July 3, 2016, the court ruled that the extension was valid and that the Players Association was bound by a no-strike provision in the agreement. This case does not apply to pay differences between men's and women's professional soccer leagues. Complaint The main complaints from the players involve claims of wage discrimination. The petitioners pointed out that men receive a $5,000 bonus for a loss in a friendly match, while women receive nothing for a loss or a draw. However, when the teams win, the men receive as much as $17,625, but women only receive $1,350. Further, in 2011, when the women placed second in their World Cup, they were awarded $1.8 million, split evenly among the 24 players on the team. The men's team made it only to the round of 16 that year; however, they were awarded $5 million. In 2014, when Germany won the Men's World Cup, the US team was awarded $35 million by FIFA, while the women received 5% of that for their Cup victory in 2015. The United States Soccer Federation responded to the complaint in a statement detailing its efforts to promote women's soccer, including its support of the National Women's Soccer League. In April 2017, the Players Association and the Federation negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement which may render the players' EEOC complaint moot. As of April 2017, the EEOC had not issued a decision. In 2019, twenty eight members of the USWNT filed a gender discrimination lawsuit. Their claims affects not only their paychecks but also where they play and how often, how they train, the medical treatment and coaching they receive, and even how they travel to matches. U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner in Los Angeles has scheduled a trial for Sept. 15 on the players‚Äô remaining claim of discriminatory work conditions. Reactions Joe Biden called on the team to not \\"give up this fight,\\" and demand US Soccer \\"pay now,\\" or \\"when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.\\" References Category:Gender pay gap Category:Sports labor disputes in the United States ","title":"U.S. women's national soccer team pay discrimination claim"},{"id":"53925473","text":"The State Labour and Social Services Inspectorate (ISHPSHS) () is a government agency in Albania tasked to ensure the implementation of legal provisions on working conditions of employees, in the exercise of their profession, duration of work, salaries, insurance, hygiene, welfare, employment of minors, juveniles, women and other labour related issues.http://inspektoriatipunes.gov.al/misioniInspektoriati Shtet√´ror i Pun√´s dhe Sh√´rbimeve Sociale References Inspectorate Category:Albania stubs ","title":"State Labour Inspectorate (Albania)"},{"id":"53925481","text":"Charles Henry Jones may refer to: *Charles Henry Jones (businessman) (1855‚Äì1933), American capitalist and philanthropist *Charles Henry Jones (editor) (1848‚Äì1913), American journalist, editor, and political figure ","title":"Charles Henry Jones"},{"id":"53925524","text":"Bottled seasoning condiments at a store in Trinidad and Tobago This is a list of brand name condiments.

According to Amatus of Montecassino, who is the chief source for the coup of 1052, the first challenge to Guaimar's authority came from the Duchy of Amalfi, which was subject to Guaimar and owed him tribute. In April, Guaimar's representative, Duke Manso II, was forced to flee Amalfi, which began attacking Salernitan shipping. With the revenue from the tribute gone, some of Guaimar's leading men began to waiver in their loyalty. According to Amatus, the leader of the conspiracy to remove Guaimar was Pandulf, who offered to reward with benefices any who would help him become prince. Although Guaimar was apparently aware of the plot, he did not believe he was vulnerable. When the Amalfitans attacked Salerno from the sea, the Pandulf and his three brothers were ordered to defend the shore. They refused and, in the ensuing argument, stabbed Guaimar to death. They also killed his chamberlain and his brother, Duke Pandulf of Capaccio. They tried to kill his other brother, Duke Guy of Sorrento, but he escaped. Amatus gives the date of the assassinations as 3 June, while the Annales Beneventani give 2 June and Guaimar's death was commemorated in the Abbey of Montecassino on 4 June.Prescott N. Dunbar (trans.) and Graham A. Loud (ed.), The History of the Normans by Amatus of Montecassino (Boydell Press, 2004). pp. 96‚Äì97.Vincenzo De Bartholomaeis (ed.), Storia de' Normanni di Amato di Montecassino volgarizzata in antico francese, Fonti per la Storia d'Italia 76 (Rome, 1935), Book III; Odon Delarc (ed.), Ystoire de li Normant par Aim√© (Rouen: A. Lestringant, 1892). Following the assassinations, Pandulf was made prince and his three younger brothers swore fealty to him. His first act was to reverse several confiscations of land made by Guaimar. He succeeded in taking the citadel of Salerno because it was poorly stocked with food and could not hold out. Guaimar's sister and other relatives in the citadel were imprisoned. Guaimar's son and heir, Gisulf, also fell into Pandulf's hands. The failure to kill Guy was the coup's undoing. Guy fled to Humphrey, the Norman count of Apulia and a faithful vassal of Guaimar. A Norman force arrived outside Salerno on 8 June. Two days later the gates were opened. Guy apparently negotiated the surrender of the citadel, promising to spare the lives of Pandulf and his co-conspirators in exchange for his nephew, Gisulf. The Normans did not feel bound by this agreement, and hunted down and killed Pandulf and thiry-five others to avenge the thirty-six wounds found on Guaimar's body. In Amatus' evaluation, Pandulf \\"was ill-advised to attempt to become prince with his three brothers\\". Among those conspirators who were captured and imprisoned were the brothers of the future archbishop of Salerno, Alfanus I.Michelangelo Schipa, \\"Storia del Principato Longobardo di Salerno\\", in La Longobardia meridionale (570‚Äì1077): Il ducato di Benevento, il principato di Salerno (Rome: Edizioni di storia e letteratura, 1968), pp. 209‚Äì10, originally published as Storia del Principato Longobardo di Salerno (Naples: Francesco Giannini e Figli 1887), in which cf. pp. 147-49.

Synopsis An image from the film, in which Jean tells his mother he intends to become a missionary A young man, Jean Liber (Paul Gu√®vremont), who, at the end of his cours classique, decides to leave his rich, happy family and his finance, Pauline (Denise Pelletier), in order to become a missionary in China. This story of his struggle, 'at the crossroads' between love and God's calling, is clearly a pretext for a film designed to encourage young men to enter missionary work. Importance √Ä la crois√©e des chemin was based on a religious drama by Guy Stein, La folle aventure, which had been staged in 1942 for 300th anniversary of the founding of Montreal. Canadian film historian Peter Morris wrote: \\"It [the film] offers a remarkable ideological portrait of Quebec before the Quiet Revolution. Clearly apparent are the values of a lifestyle fostered by a militant Catholic Church: friendship, warmth, and an unproblematic family life. Equally apparent (at least in retrospect) are destructive self-sacrifice, repressed sexuality, and mutually sustaining links between religious and economic establishments.\\" References Category:1943 films Category:History of Catholicism in Quebec Category:Quebec films Category:Films about Catholicism Category:Ren√© L√©vesque Category:Canadian black-and-white films Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in China Category:Canadian missionaries Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films Category:1943 drama films ","title":"At the Crossroads (film)"},{"id":"53925799","text":"An Equal Playing Field is a 2015 sports documentary about American soccer player Christen Press and the challenges of being a women's soccer player.

It is the sequel to Gotha: Ismailia Seneki. It was an exclusive for the Sega Saturn in North America, while in Japan it also appeared on the PlayStation. Plot In contrast to the historical settings of Koei's previous strategy games, Heir of Zendor is set in a science fiction milieu. The planet of Zendor is rich in anti-gravity ore. In the past, pirates grew so strong that they formed a faction called The Guild. The Guild and the Alliance of City States fought for control of the skies for years until accidentally awakening giant battleships. These ships were programmed to protect Terra Sancta (the Sacred Land), a floating continent. The power of the automated battleships was enough to wipe out entire continents, thus ending the war. One man managed to get past the battleships and their defenses at Terra Sancta, and now controls the last of the major water sources in the world. He allows the water to be controlled and distributed by five of his allies, the \\"Five Kings\\". As the population grows and water becomes more scarce, eventually war breaks out between the forces of the Kings, the Alliance of City States, and various rebel factions. The player takes on the role of a Prince of the Royal Alliance Expeditionary Forces in service to the Five Kings.https://segaretro.org/File:HeirofZendor_Saturn_US_Box_Back.jpg Gameplay Heir of Zendor: The Legend and The Land is a turn-based strategy game. At the beginning of each mission, the player can view information on all ships in play and select the ships which will accompany the flagship into battle and their weapons payloads. During battle, each side moves all their ships in turn. In addition to maneuvering and attacking, ships can be moved in formation and be set to automatically retaliate against attacks. The game supports the Saturn Mouse in addition to the standard controller. Heir of Zendor features multiple story branches. After completing the game, the player can start over with the upgraded ships from the last game. Reception Heir of Zendor: The Legend and The Land received mixed to negative reviews from video game critics. Critics generally praised the refined and involving strategic gameplay, but criticized the spartan graphics, especially the use of static screens for cutscenes. Koei's decision to break from their forte of historical settings was also disapproved of by some critics, though Bonehead of GamePro found the story \\"deep\\". GameSpot concluded, \\"it's hard to believe anyone at Sega or Koei let a product this bad onto the market\\", while Next Generation felt that though Dragon Force would be a better choice for the typical gamer, war simulation enthusiasts would find Heir of Zendor very enjoyable.

Etymology The passion fruit is so called because it is one of the many species of passion flower, the English translation of the Latin genus name, Passiflora, and may be spelled \\"passion fruit\\", \\"passionfruit\\", or \\"passion-fruit\\". Around 1700, the name was given by missionaries in Brazil as an educational aid while trying to convert the indigenous inhabitants to Christianity; its name was flor das cinco chagas or \\"flower of the five wounds\\" to illustrate the crucifixion of Christ, with other plant components also named after an emblem in the Passion of Jesus. Appearance and structure Passion fruits are round or oval. They can be yellow, red, purple, and green. The fruits have a juicy edible center composed of a large number of seeds. Varieties Edible passion fruits can be divided into three main types: * purple passion fruit (fruits of Passiflora edulis Sims), * yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa Deg.), * giant granadilla (Passiflora quadrangularis L.). Uses The part of the fruit that is used (eaten) is the pulpy juicy seeds. Passion fruits can also be squeezed to make juice. Nutrition Raw passion fruit is 73% water, 22% carbohydrates, 2% protein and 0.7% fat (table). In a 100 gram amount, fresh passion fruit supplies 97 calories, and contains 36% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C, 42% dietary fiber, B vitamins riboflavin (11% DV) and niacin (10% DV), 12% iron and 10% phosphorus (table).

He is best known for creating the Trix Rabbit, the cartoon mascot for General Mills' Trix breakfast cereal, who debuted in 1959. He also penned the Trix rabbit's memorable commercial tagline, \\"Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids\\", which is still utilized in General Mills' advertising campaign, as of 2017. Additionally, in 1959 Harris, Chet Stover, and W. Watts Biggers co-founded Total Television, which produced Saturday morning cartoons. Harris created some of Total Television's best known characters and series, including King Leonardo and His Short Subjects (1960‚Äì1963), Klondike Kat (1963‚Äì1965), and Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales (1963‚Äì1966). His best known character creation aside from the Trix Rabbit was Underdog, the canine star of the animated series, Underdog, from 1964 to 1967. Biography Joe Harris was born on January 5, 1928, in Jersey City, New Jersey, to Gladys (n√©e Golden) and Charlie Harris. He enlisted and served in both the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. He graduated from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. Harris joined the staff of the New York City-based ad agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample as a copywriter shortly after graduating from Pratt. In 1954, one of Dancer Fitzgerald Sample's clients, General Mills, introduced Trix cereal as a sugar-coated version of its popular brand, Kix. The company experimented with a puppet rabbit for Trix commercials as early as 1955. However, Harris, then an illustrator and copywriter for Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, created the cereal's now iconic animated mascot, the Trix rabbit, who debuted in television commercials in 1959. Harris also conceived the Trix commercial's tagline, \\"Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids\\", utilized as the foil whenever children stop the rabbit from stealing Trix cereal. Harris' tagline, and his famous Trix rabbit, are still used in General Mills' Trix campaign fifty years after its first commercial. Chet Stover, who managed the General Mills' Trix account for Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, fully credited Harris with creating the Trix rabbit in an internal memo to the company, writing, \\"In a business where the only thing we have to sell are ideas, it is of first importance the credit is given where credit belongs ‚Äî and Joe gets all the credit for this one.\\" In 1959, Harris joined with several Dancer Fitzgerald Sample colleagues, including Stover and W. Watts Biggers, to co-found Total Television, which produced Saturday morning cartoons. Harris personally created several of Total Television's iconic cartoon characters, most famously Underdog, the dog superhero and star of the 1960s animated series, Underdog. Harris' also designed other notable creations, including King Leonardo, Klondike Kat and Tennessee Tuxedo. Additionally, Harris drew the storyboards for Total Television's animated shows, while Stover and Biggers, a Dancer Fitzgerald Sample account manager, wrote penned the scripts for the episodes. Harris returned to the advertising industry after Total Television folded in 1969. He also penned and illustrated several children's books, including \\"The Belly Book.\\" Harris died at his home in Stamford, Connecticut, on March 26, 2017, at the age of 89. His first wife, Janet Opel, died in 1981, while his second wife, Vanessa Campbell, died in 2002. He was survived by three daughters, Merrie Harris, Joelle Malec, and Sophie Harris; three grandchildren, and his stepbrother, David.

Mills Dam is a steel dam and generating facility located on the Arkansas River in Arkansas County and Desha County, Arkansas, United States. The dam is part of the McClellan‚ÄìKerr Arkansas River Navigation System, and is named for Wilbur D. Mills, a member of United States House of Representatives from Arkansas. Design Wilbur D. Mills Dam is high, and consists of a long earthen embankment, a long high-level overflow, and a long spillway. History Navigation chart The course of the lower Arkansas River changes significantly downstream from the location of the dam, where the river follows a long winding route until it reaches its outflow at the Mississippi River, approximately southeast. This circuitous portion of the Arkansas River between the current dam location and the Mississippi River was historically bypassed by river vessels; early steamboats instead followed a network of rivers‚Äîknown as the Arkansas Post Canal‚Äîwhich flowed north of the lower Arkansas River, and followed a shorter and more direct route to the Mississippi River. When the McClellan‚ÄìKerr Arkansas River Navigation System was constructed between 1963 and 1970, the Arkansas Post Canal was significantly improved, while the lower Arkansas River continued to be bypassed by river vessels. For this reason, the dam was erected with no lock facilities because the waters downstream of the dam were used only by small recreational boats. Access to the Arkansas Post Canal is northwest of the Wilbur D. Mills Dam. The dam was at first called Dam Number 2, and was constructed between 1963 and 1968. In 1982, flooding along the Arkansas River caused 38 barges to break loose between and upstream from the dam. Fourteen of the barges struck the dam while two passed through the dam's open gate bays. Initial repairs cost $141,000, and additional repairs were initiated in 1990. A hydroelectric power plant was installed at the dam between 1994 and 1999. Completed at a cost of $189 million, the plant has a generating capacity of 102.6 megawatts. Recreation area The Wilbur D. Mills Campground is located on the Arkansas County side of the dam. The campground has 21 campsites and a boat launch.

One significant reason why these students have been marginalized from continuing their education is their being denied federal student aid. Many were disqualified due to the lack of having a high school diploma while others were not able to pass standardized tests which should indicate if their claim to secure aid is justified. With the legislation of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, students with ID can now qualify for student grants and work-study programs. In the past 20 years, PSE programs for students with ID have become prevalent throughout the United States (Plotner & Marshall, 2015). In 2010, the Office of Post- secondary Education provided financial support for the development of PSE programs through grants. While attaining any type of academic degree is not possible for many students with ID, they do stand to benefit from participating in PSE programs. The benefits do not necessarily lead to traditional measures of academic achievement. Instead, students gain increased independence, self-determination, positive social experiences, self-advocacy, problem solving, self-monitoring and goal setting and time management skills. All of these skills help students be more independent, improve their psychological well being and provide them stronger opportunities to find employment. In a study conducted by Ross and colleagues, researchers compared employment and independent living outcomes of 125 graduates from the Taft College Transition to Independent Living (TIL) program designed for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities with outcomes from the general population of people with ID and developmental disabilities. The researchers found that 94% of TIL graduates lived by themselves, with their spouse or roommates in a home that they rented or owned compared to only 16% in the general population. Furthermore, the study found that 95% of graduates continue to socialize with fellow alumni through home visits, phone calls or email. Employment Students with ID have some of the worst employment outcomes of all disability populations (Grigal, Hart & Weir, 2013). In 2009, only 35% of young adults between the ages of 21 and 25 were employed. By contrast, during the same time period, the average employment rate was at 90.2% (Moore & Schelling, 2014). That same year, 40.3% of employees with ID earned less the federal minimum wage (Moore and Schelling, 2014). The combination of an increasing number of jobs requiring some type of education after high school and their history of exclusion from the higher education system have led to this conclusion. In the past, employment options for people with ID have been limited to supported employment and sheltered workshops (Foley et al., 2012). Going to college is often connected with getting well paying jobs and higher employment rates. This premise applies to students with disabilities including those with ID (Butler, Sheppard-Jones, Whaley, Harrison & Osness, 2015). Students that attend a PSE program are more likely to find employment than those who only complete high school (Butler et al., 2015). Smith, Grigal & Sulewski (2012) investigated the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is a national survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau designed to understand changing communities. The researchers compare findings on people with disabilities, with cognitive disabilities and no disabilities. They found that 43% of people with cognitive disabilities and some college credit were employed compared to 31% who had only completed high school. Additionally, students with ID who attend a PSE program are more likely to earn higher wages (Hart, Grigal & Weir, 2010). For example, Ross and colleagues (2012) found that 87% of TIL graduates who were employed earned at least the minimum wage. In one study, Moore and Schelling (2015) compare the employment outcomes of alumni from two PSE programs and a control group made up of people who never attended a program by surveying the participants. They found that students who attended a PSE program were employed at higher frequencies in office support at 58%, sales at 17% and teaching at 17%. Inclusion Efforts to make college a legitimate option and a reality for students with ID have been led by advocacy groups such as the DREAM Partnership and Think College (Grigal, Hart &Weir;, 2013). Although the benefits of entering PSE are plentiful, only 37% of students with ID continue their education after high school (Hart et al., 2004). Once in college, even though students with disabilities participate in campus events and students life, they tend to feel as lonely as non-students (Butler et al., 2015). Still, progress has been made. For example, in K-12 education, students with disabilities are increasingly getting more integrated into mainstream classrooms and are succeeding with reasonable supports (Hart, Grigal & Weir, 2010). Supports and accommodations Several laws exist in the United States that assure individuals with disabilities receive reasonable accommodations in their school. For example, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects the rights of disabled people to participate in federally funded programs, services or benefits (Grigal, Hart & Weir, 2013). Under this act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, students may receive accommodations (Hart, Grigal & Weir, 2010). Accommodations may vary from college to college but usually include the assistance of a designated note taker, extended time for tests, taking tests at a designated quiet space, voice recorders for lectures and assistive technology computer software such as text-to-speech and speech recognition software (Grigal, Hart & Weir, 2013). A common support is the use of peer mentors, coaches or ambassadors who assist students with understanding their assignments, finding campus resources and engaging in campus activities (Grigal, Hart & Weir, 2013). Post-secondary education programs There are two main paths for students with ID that are interested in continuing their education after high school. One path, known as the inclusive, individual support model (Hart et al., 2004; Plotner & Marshall, 2015), is to complete entrance examinations, applications and complete degree requirements with the use of accommodations (Hart, Grigal & Weir, 2015). The second path is to not matriculate but instead enter into PSE program designed for students with ID. In these programs, students may take credit or non credit courses, audit courses or take extended study courses (Hart, Grigal & Weir, 2010). The minimum requirements to be admitted into a PSE program are to read at a third grade minimum and not be considered able to attain a degree with support (Moore & Schelling, 2015). Currently, there are over 220 PSE programs in the United States (Plotner & Marshall, 2015). While wide variation exists among programs, they do share several features. For example, they do not focus on academic access; the focus is on independent living skills and employment development (Grigal, Hart & Weir, 2013; Moore & Schelling, 2015). Programs usually collaborate with outside organizations such as local school districts, the department of rehabilitation and local non-profit community organizations (Grigal, Hart & Weir, 2013). In addition, programs use person centered planning to develop a structure that will help the student meet their goals. PSE programs can be categorized into three types: the dual enrollment model, the substantively separate model and the mixed model. Close to a third of PSE programs in the United States follow the dual enrollment model (Plotner & Marshall, 2015). Programs with this model are funded through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004. The act provides for special education transition services to students with ID up to the age of 21 to attend college (Hart, Grigal & Weir, 2010). In these programs, students attend high school and college courses simultaneously. The college courses may be restricted to non-credit, continuing education or to courses specifically designed for students with ID (Hart, Grigal & Weir, 2010). Programs that follow the substantively separate approach hold student courses and social activities on campus yet the courses are restricted to their program (Plotmer & Marshall, 2015). These programs tend to serve larger student populations compared to the mixed programs (Hart et al., 2004). Moreover, students who participate in this type of programs usually have very little interaction with other students outside of the program (Hart et al., 2004). Mixed model programs attempts to include their students with the rest of the student body. Students are encouraged to be very active in campus activities and they take mostly inclusive courses while completing their program courses which focus on employment building skills (Plotner & Marshall, 2015).

Biography Paul Libby received his bachelor's degree in 1942 and obtained his PhD in 1948, both from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. He also served in the United States Navy in between his Bachelors and Doctorate degree; he was a Junior Grade Lieutenant when discharged. He joined the faculty of Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and advanced to the rank of Professor. At that time, the famous aerodynamist Antonio Ferri, a friend of Theodore von K√°rm√°n, joined the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. Libby worked with Ferri as an assistant for ten years. In 1962, when Sol Penner was looking for faculty for the newly-found School of Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, Libby was recommended to Penner by von K√°rm√°n. He joined UCSD in 1964 as one of the 10 founding faculty members. He served as department chair from 1973 to 1976. He also served as Acting Dean and Associate Dean of Graduate affairs. Research Paul Libby's research focuses on a broad range of topics in fluid dynamics including boundary layers, turbulence, aerothermochemistry and combustion. The structure of shock waves was exactly solved by Morduchow and Libby in 1949Morris Morduchow and Paul A. Libby (1949), On a complete solution of the one-dimensional flow equations of a viscous, heat-conducting, compressible gas. Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences, 16(11), 674-684., demonstrating that the entropy of the gas goes through a maximum upon crossing the shock wave. He, along with Keith Stewartson, were the first to identify the eigensolutions of boundary layer equations and to study the uniqueness of the boundary-layer solutions. Homann flow, axisymmetric stagnation point flows, was generalized by Libby. Paul Libby, along with Kenneth Bray, discovered an important phenomenon known as Counter-gradient diffusion in turbulent flames, in a series of papers in the 80s which are considered important contributions to our understanding of turbulent combustion.Bray, K.

Plot Nine-year-old Isabelle \\"Belle\\" Alvarado listens to a radio broadcast of the Thrilla in Manila with her father Chuck Alvarado, an LAPD patrol officer and former Golden Gloves champion. As they celebrate Muhammad Ali's victory, Carmen Alvarado, Chuck's wife and Belle's mother, reminds them that dinner is ready and that today is her and Chuck's 10th wedding anniversary, which he has forgotten. Chuck volunteers as a youth boxing coach at a local gym, and teaches Belle to box as a form of self-defense, though he's hesitant to have her spar. After some pleading from Belle, Chuck relents and allows her in the ring, where she knocks out a boy in a match. Carmen is furious when Belle comes home with a black eye, and demands that Chuck stop teaching Belle to box. While upset, Carmen grows lightheaded and nearly faints, which Chuck recognizes as one of her increasingly frequent headaches. He implores her to see a doctor. Carmen sees many specialists, who all determine she has a malignant brain tumor and does not have long to live. Fifteen years later, Carmen has passed away, Belle is working as a dance instructor, and Chuck has recently taken the graveyard shift. Chuck's partner, Mario Rodriguez, has a crush on Belle. Mario also coaches local professional boxer Sandra \\"The Lion\\" Lopez, a mutual friend of Belle's. Belle visits them at the gym, and Sandra goads Belle into sparring with her, to see what she still remembers from her lessons as a kid. After being knocked down a couple times, Belle grows angry and manages to knock Sandra down, to the latter's chagrin. In the locker room, the two dispose of any hard feelings, and Sandra suggests that Belle become a pro boxer. She also invites Belle to her next fight. At the match, boxing manager Michael DeMarco introduces himself to Belle, finding her attractive, which annoys Mario. In the fight itself, Sandra suffers a vicious beating and knockout from her opponent, Tanya \\"The Terminator\\" Tessaro, which leaves her in a coma. Saddened and angered by Sandra's injury, Belle takes her suggestion to heart and visits Michael at his office, where she declares her intent to be a boxer. Intrigued, Michael schedules an appointment with boxing promoter Ron Regent to demonstrate Belle's viability as an investment. Belle takes offense to marketing her based only on her looks, and convinces Ron to support her based on her boxing skills. Belle informs Chuck and Marco of her decision, and while initially against the idea, the two eventually accept and help train her. Ron books Belle a fight with a boxer repped by Don King, rationalizing that Belle winning will instantly catapult her career. After a rough first round, Belle knocks her opponent out in the second. Belle's fame skyrockets as she accrues an 8-0 record (most of them by KO) and appears on the covers of such magazines as The Ring and Sports Illustrated. In the meantime, she continues to visit Sandra in the hospital almost daily. Tanya, also repped by Don King, is set to fight for the WFBA lightweight world championship, and should she win, her first title defense will be against Belle, the number-one contender. Ron tells Michael to discuss this with Belle, but Michael explains the contract to her in a way that implies it will take time to land her a title shot. Meanwhile, Sandra has awoken from her coma, and tells Belle she may be paralyzed from the waist down. After she wins the WFBA title, Tanya publicly insults Belle, calling her a coward. Realizing that Michael lied about her contract, Belle angrily confronts him. Michael explains that he doesn't think Belle stands a chance against Tanya, and that he was protecting her. Belle accuses him of caring only about money, and things grow heated, eventually leading to Michael calling Belle a racial slur and her slapping him. Belle drops Michael as her manager. Belle meets with Ron, who denies knowing anything about Michael's intent. They schedule a championship bout against Tanya in Las Vegas. Chuck and Mario are overjoyed at the news, and continue to help Belle train. Belle and Mario leave for Vegas to participate in the media week prior to the fight. Chuck stays in LA for the moment, but says he will attend the fight itself. However, that same night he is killed at his station while protecting an arrestee from being shot by a second, who had stolen another officer's gun. Belle is despondent over Chuck's death. After returning to Vegas after the funeral, Mario convinces her that, while it's difficult, Chuck would not want her to give up her dreams. When he asks if she wants to cancel or postpone the fight, Belle refuses, agreeing that her father would want her to \\"kick [Tanya's] ass and bring home the belt.\\" At the championship, Tanya tries to get under Belle's skin before the fight, including insulting her dead father. Belle responds aggressively during the first round, in which she is knocked down. Between rounds, Mario reminds her to pace herself, as wearing Tanya down over time is key, and not to let her emotions take over. Near the end of round 7, Tanya intentionally headbutts Belle, opening a cut over Belle's left eye. The referee tries to end the fight due to the cut, which would likely result in Tanya winning due to her almost certainly being ahead on points. However, Belle begs him for just one more round, and he agrees. In round 8, Belle knocks the champion down for the first time in her career. Tanya is unable to stand by the count of 10, ending the fight with one second left in the round. Belle wins by knockout and becomes the new WFBA lightweight world champion. During an interview in the ring after the fight, a tearful Belle thanks God for giving her strength and her late parents for the values they instilled in her. She ends by joyfully declaring \\"Mommy and Daddy... I did it, your little girl did it! I'm the champion of the world! I'm the champion of the world!\\" Back in LA, Belle and Mario visit Chuck's grave, where Belle places her title belt on his headstone.

Publication history The Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia was first published in 1991, compiling and revising the major rules from the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Rules, Expert Rules, Companion Rules, and Master Rules boxed sets. Instead of also adding the major rules from the Immortals Rules box set to the Rules Cyclopedia, TSR published a separate product in 1992: Wrath of the Immortals. The box set contains two books: the 128-page core rulebook titled Codex of the Immortals and a 96-page campaign setting titled The Immortals' Fury. The set also includes two poster-sized maps that go with the latter book. Both books were written by Aaron Allston, who also worked on the Rules Cyclopedia. Jeff Easley and Terry Dykstra also returned to provide the cover and interior artwork, respectively. Contents The first book in the box set, the Codex of the Immortals, contains the revised rules on supporting Immortals. The book's introduction lists some of the major rule changes from the Immortals Rules box set, also noting that these rules also supplant those in the Rules Cyclopedia regarding immortals. The book also contains an overview of all the immortal NPCs in the Known World (Mystara) and Hollow World campaign settings. The second book, The Immortals' Fury, is a campaign saga set in the Known World (Mystara) and Hollow World settings. The Dungeon Master is warned that the adventure \\"will result in catastrophic alterations to the world's surface ... [and] the Hollow World setting, as well\\". It also provides a detailed, updated timeline of Mystara that was first presented in both the Gazetteers series and the Hollow World box set, both ret-conning related past events as well as listing events that result because of the adventure (as well as how the player characters interact in these changing events). It is split into three major parts: Phase One, designed for characters of level 1‚Äì5, and taking place four years after the \\"present time\\" depicted in the Gazetteers; Phase Two, to be played when the player characters are at least at level 6, and between five and six years after the \\"present time\\"; and Phase Three, when the player characters are at least at level 16, and roughly seven years after the \\"present time\\". In Phase One, the player characters explore a castle in which they eventually find a being trapped in an artifact, who, after being rescued, becomes a powerfully ally. In Phase Two, all the nations of the Known World are preparing to war with each other, and the being that was previously rescued asks the player characters to find evidence that Immortals are behind these events. In Phase Three, when all the nations are at war, the player characters discover the Immortals' plans and attempt to stop it. One of the two maps in the box set depicts the Known World before the events of The Immortals' Fury, and the other map depicts the changed world in its aftermath.

After working in the field for fifteen years, Fondacaro was promoted to Navy Officer Captain in the Royal Navy of Italy on 24th May 1876.  Voyages  Following the Battle of Lissa, Fondacaro longed to cross the Atlantic Ocean from Montevideo to Las Palmas on a boat of his own design. The boat, called \\"Leone di Caprera\\" in honour of Giuseppe Garibaldi, measured approximately 9m x 2.30m x 1.60m and weighed 3 tonnes. Fondacaro's crew included Pietro Zoccoli and Orlando Grassoni. On 19th September 1880 the \\"Leone di Caprera\\" set off from Montevideo. On 10 February 1881, the crew reached Castello di Farro. On 26th May 1881, the boat was towed to Livorno by an English vessel. Today, the \\"Leone di Caprera\\" can still be seen at the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci in Milan.

It is a biomolecularly engineered molecule consisting of the two main components: (1) antibody; (2) vaccine. (1) The antibody component binds AVEC to the targeted molecule, e.g., to epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on breast cancer cells. (2) The vaccine component elicits an immune response, directed against the cancer cells bound by the antibody component, e.g., immune response to the HBV vaccine mounted by the prophylactic immunity gained by vaccination. It has the potential to be used to treat a variety of types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer and leukemias.http://genomicrx.com/services/ Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of AVEC relies upon the immunity acquired through vaccination or natural illness against microbials (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) being redirected, amplified, and accelerated against the cancer cells. For example, a person vaccinated against hepatitis B virus, but suffering from HER2+ breast cancer receives AVEC, consisting of the antibody against HER2 and vaccine against HBV (AVEC: anti-HER2 - HBV). Since this persons immune system has already prepared a response to the HBV virus, it will instantly attack any cell tagged by it, in this case the breast cancer cells, overexpressing HER2. As such, AVEC attracts the components of the immune response like a lightning-rod attracts the thunderbolts during storms. Research A 2016 compared AVECs ability to induce apoptosis and necrosis in HER2+ breast cancer compared to the commonly used drug Trastuzumab. It found that the cells was treated with AVEC had a statistically significant higher amount of both apoptosis and necrosis. The percentage of necrotic cells due to treatment with AVEC more than tripled compared to necrotic cells due to treatment with Trastuzumab.

Within the IMF, Ireland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement.  2010 bailout  During 2010, the IMF had to use its economic bailout capacity to support Ireland and other European Union Member nations as a result of the economic fallout following the Great Recession. During the recession and the subsequent Post-2008 Irish banking crisis the economy went into an economic downfall which led to economic and political turmoil. EU states drew on international funding packages totaling 85 billion euros, of which Ireland received credit of 22.5 billion euros to fund programmes to restore the banking system back to health, and reduce budget deficits. During the bailout period in 2010 the main focus for the IMF and the EU, and in turn the Government of Ireland, was to get banking systems mobilised properly and to restore the health of the public finance market. This process, which began in December 2010, involved a three- year lending arrangement which was meant to enhance the economy of Ireland and the EU. This was done in three stages, as defined by the IMF and EU. The first stage was to identify those banks that remained viable, and return them to health through reorganisation. The second stage was to recapitalise banks and encourage them to rely on deposit inflows and market-based funding. The third and last stage was to strengthen bank supervision and introduce a comprehensive bank resolution framework. At the time of the bailout the Irish government's National Recovery Plan aimed for savings worth 15 billion euros, roughly 9 percent of the nation's GDP, over the period 2011-14. Savings worth 6 billion euros were undertaken in 2011 alone. = Aftermath = After the bailout the Irish Government followed the IMF's recommendations in regards to investing in banking reform. On 27 July 2016, the Executive Board of the IMF analysed the progress of Ireland's economy in the Article IV consultation, the fifth post-programme monitoring discussion with Ireland since the bailout. The Article IV report stated that the rebound of the Irish economy was exceptional. Ireland's GDP grew by 7.8 percent in 2015 on the back of strong domestic demand and solid export growth. As of 2017 the economic prosperity in Ireland continued to grow. The Irish Times stated that the IMF expected Irish economy to grow by 3.5% in 2017. However amid the recent external economic risks from other nations activities, most notably Brexit, the March 2017 Article IV consultation has stated that while the medium-term outlook remains positive, that Ireland and the IMF should continue to prepare for any future economic hardships from external factors. As of 20 December 2017, Ireland is no longer in debt to the IMF.

Biography  Born in Cincinnati, Zaring moved to Evansville, Indiana at the age of nine when her father became pastor of the Evansville German Lutheran Church. She received her first education at Walters College in St. Louis, the Evansville Commercial College in Indiana, and the Art Students League of New York, where she spent a year under Frank Vincent DuMond from 1893 until 1894. Between 1894 and 1896 she studied in Paris at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and the Acad√©mie Vitti, and from 1896 to 1897 she was at the school of Harry Van Der Weyden and L. R. Garrido in the same city. Her instructors in Paris included Frederick MacMonnies, Edmond Aman-Jean, Rapha√´l Collin, Julien Dupr√©, Andr√© Castaigne, and Louis Dessar. She showed work at the Paris Salon of 1897. Zaring then returned to the United States, where she continued exhibiting widely. She had further lessons in Greencastle, Indiana, where she worked briefly with John Henry Twachtman and William Forsyth; the former would leave an influence on some of her early work, although later her paintings became broader and more painterly in nature. In the summer of 1911 Zaring took lessons at the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis under Forsyth. She also studied at the Cape Cod School of Art under Charles Webster Hawthorne, and in the early 1920s she attended the summer program of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania. Around 1898 she married Dr. C. T. Zaring of Greencastle, in which town she lived and worked until the late 1920s, when she moved to Florida. There she was a cofounder of the Miami Art League in 1930, at which she also taught. Other organizations to which she belonged included the National League of American Penwomen, the Provincetown Art Association, and the American Federation of Arts. During her career, Zaring exhibited work at the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 and in the first Hoosier Salon in 1925, at which she won a prize for Best Marine Scene. She showed work at many other exhibitions throughout the United States before dying in Broward, Florida, in 1970.

Both an alumna and faculty member of Stanford University, Merrill worked with Lewis Terman to develop the second and third editions of the Stanford‚ÄìBinet Intelligence Scales. Early life Merrill was born in 1888 in Owatonna, Minnesota. As a child she lived at the Minnesota State Public School for Dependent and Neglected Children, an orphanage of which her father was the director. She earned a psychology degree from Oberlin College in 1911. Career Employed by the Minnesota Bureau of Research, Merrill was a research assistant assigned to the Faribault Minnesota State Home for the Feeble Minded and she worked as an assistant to bureau head Fred Kuhlmann. After several years with the bureau, she decided to return to school to pursue a Ph.D. in psychology. Merrill wrote to Stanford to inquire about their graduate psychology program, but department head Frank Angell sent her a lukewarm reply asking her why she could not attend a school closer to her. Upon hearing about Angell's reply, Kuhlmann decided to intervene on Merrill's behalf. Kuhlmann wrote directly to educational psychology professor Lewis Terman, a well-known intelligence researcher with whom Merrill hoped to work. Merrill worked with Terman as she earned a master's degree in education. Terman later took over as head of the psychology department, and Merrill earned a Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford in 1923. Merrill became a faculty member at Stanford, where she continued to work with Terman. The pair collaborated on Genetic Studies of Genius, a longitudinal study of highly intelligent people. Terman and Merrill published a second edition of his Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales (1931). Though she retired in 1954 and Terman died in 1956, Merrill released a third edition of the scales in 1960. Merrill was a mentor to budding developmental psychologist Jeanne Block, who became known for her studies of twin and non-twin siblings. Merrill also worked as a consultant for the juvenile courts in San Jose, California. That work introduced her to Judge William Francis James, who she grew fond of and married in 1933. After her marriage she was occasionally referred to as Merrill-James (or Merrill James) but continued to use the name Merrill in her publications. The work for the juvenile courts also inspired her 1947 book, Problems of Child Delinquency. That book explored the environments and temperaments of delinquent children. In a review of the book, Ohio State University professor Walter Reckless said that her work \\"gives ample reason to reconsider the factor of the broken-home family, which many sociologists have discounted in recent years, as well as the IQ level in determining delinquency...\\" Death Merrill died at her home in 1978. She lived on the Stanford University campus for nearly 60 years as a graduate student, faculty member and retiree. She was predeceased by her husband in 1966.

Led by radiologist Eugene L. Saenger, the experiments were funded in part by the Defense Atomic Support Agency within the Department of Defense to study how soldiers in nuclear war would be affected by large doses of radiation. The experiments were conducted without patient consent in the first five years of the study and with disputed levels of consent thereafter. The irradiated patients experienced nausea, vomiting, cognitive impairment, and death. The contract between the researchers and the DOD terminated in 1972 under pressure from Senator Edward Kennedy, marking the end of major human irradiation experimentation in the U.S. that began after World War II and continued throughout the Cold War Era. Although initially fading from public eye, the controversy resurfaced in 1993 and was soon investigated by President Bill Clinton‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments. In 1994, families of the patients filed a class-action lawsuit against the team of 15 researchers. Five years later, the University of Cincinnati settled the case for over $4 million.  Experiments and Controversies  = Department of Defense funding = On September 25, 1958, Saenger sent a grant proposal entitled ‚ÄúMetabolic Changes in Human following Total Body Radiation‚Äù to the Department of Defense, requesting $25,085 to analyze the amino-aciduria levels in the urine of total body irradiated patients. Although multiple military researchers, including the Director of the Division of Nuclear Medicine and Chemistry, wrote to the US Army Medical Research and Development Command that they doubted the practical value of Dr. Saenger's proposed study, the DOD approved the grant proposal due to its possibility of evaluating the combat effectiveness of soldiers in nuclear warfare. The initial grant proposal evolved into an 11-year contract, in which the DOD provided a total of $671,482.79 in funds. Detailing the progress of the experiment were a series of 10 progress reports sent to the DOD from 1960-1972, the first five of which were entitled ‚ÄúMetabolic Changes in Humans Following Total Body Irradiation‚Äù and the last five ‚ÄúRadiation Effects in Man: Manifestations and Therapeutic Efforts.‚Äù The irradiation experiments only began after the DOD funding was received, with the first known experiment occurring on May 24, 1960. There is controversy regarding how the DOD funds were allocated. Dr. Saenger maintained that while the DOD funds were used to buy irradiation equipment, run laboratory tests, and hire personnel, only University funds directly financed the patients' irradiation treatment. However, the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments held that without the DOD funds, Dr. Saenger could not have begun the irradiation tests. = Military purpose = As part of the DOD contract, the radiation experiments attempted to imitate nuclear wartime conditions in order to accurately evaluate the cognitive and physiological effects of radiation on a soldier. During irradiation, patients‚Äô bodies were positioned to mirror a soldier's defensive position; the radiation was intended, but not proven, to be administered unidirectionally to reflect a soldier's exposure; and the irradiation was administered all at once, which diverged from the standard medical practice at the time, where cancer patients were given small doses cumulatively to maximize destruction of cancer cells. Even so, in the progress reports sent to the DOD and in his testimony to the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations in 1994, Dr. Saenger maintained that the primary goal of the study was to provide palliative and therapeutic care to the patients. According to Dr. Saenger, the study of radiation effects on a soldier's performance was a secondary goal. = Patient selection = The patients were referred to Dr. Saenger's experiments by the Cincinnati General Hospital's Tumor Clinic. All the patients had advanced stage cancers, including breast, lung, colon, pancreas, skin, sinus, ovarian, lymph, cervical, rectal, liver, stomach, esophagus, bowel, tongue, brain, tonsil, rectum, intestinal, and bone cancers. Although they were all cancerous, Dr. Saenger sought patients that were in good nutritional health, and who had not been exposed to previous radiation treatment. The patient selection process was the subject of another controversy. David Egilman, a doctor practicing in Massachusetts at the time, criticized the patient selection and irradiation processes in a statement to the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, writing that many of the cancers were radio-resistant and could not have been treated effectively without killing the patient. On the other hand, the American College of Radiology, after sending representatives to Dr. Saenger's laboratory during the irradiation experiments, concluded in a 1972 peer review that the patient selection process and the experiments as a whole ‚Äúconformed with good medical practice.‚Äù = Health effects = The experiments administered between 25 and 300 rad of Cobalt-60 total body and partial body irradiation, comparable to 20,000 chest x-rays, within hours. There were also plans to increase the radiation dosage to 600 rad. In addition, bone marrow was occasionally extracted prior to the irradiation and later reinfused in an effort to alleviate the debilitating health effects of the radiation. The irradiated patients experienced a wide variety of side-effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, emaciation, hemorrhaging, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and hallucinations. 1/4 of the patients died within 2 months of irradiation, and over 3/4 of the patients died within a year. In his testimony, Dr. Saenger maintained that assessing the direct contribution of the irradiation to the mortality rates is impossible due to the variety of health factors acting as confounding variables: prior chemotherapy treatment, localized radiation treatment, and the advanced stage cancer itself. He claimed that the cancer was the primary factor in the patients‚Äô deaths, and that the irradiation had palliative benefits for 31% of the patients. = Consent forms = From 1960-1965, no written consent forms were used in the experiments, in accordance with the requirements of the Cincinnati General Hospital; the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; and the Department of Defense. In April 1965, the patients were given consent forms that, according to Dr. Saenger, appropriately discussed the dangers of the irradiation. However, David Egilman claimed that these forms did not mention any relevant side effects of the irradiation. In 1969, the National Institutes of Health evaluated the Cincinnati General Hospital's ethical practices, prompting Dr. Saenger to adopt a new consent form outlining the purpose, procedure, and risks of the irradiation tests to the patients. Even so, no consent form used mentioned possible death. During the 1994 trial, family members of the patients alleged that the researchers forged certain patients' signatures on the consent forms. = Researchers = * Dr. Eugene L. Saenger * Dr. Edward B.

Varon  Patients  = Statistics = Although only 89 patients have been identified, medical records indicate that at least 90 patients were involved in the experiments. Moreover, the progress reports sent to the DOD suggest that 10 additional individuals were irradiated whose treatments were not included in the medical records. Approximately 43% of the known patients were female, and 57% male. The average age of the patients was 59, but three children aged 9, 10, and 13 were also irradiated. To see a list of the 89 identified patients, see Appendix 1 of The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests by Martha Stephens. = Socioeconomic status = The average patient had 5 years of formal education, with an average IQ of 89. 62% were African-American, and the majority were working class. A report published in 1972 claimed that the socioeconomic status of the patients matched the general makeup of the Cincinnati General Hospital.  Institutional Review (1958-1972)  From the initial budget proposal in 1958 to 1966, the University of Cincinnati had no institutional review boards (IRBs) that evaluated the ethical practices of the Cincinnati Radiation Experiments, and IRBs were not formally required by law for government-funded research until 1974. In 1966, however, the University created the Faculty Committee on Research (FCR) in compliance with an order from the US Public Health Service,Egilman, David (1998). A Little Too Much of the Buchenwald Touch? Military Radiation Research at the University of Cincinnati, 1960-1972.

A Little Too Much of the Buchenwald Touch? Military Radiation Research at the University of Cincinnati, 1960-1972. India: Overseas Publishers Association. p. 89. In March 1966, Dr. Saenger proposed an additional research plan called ‚ÄúProtection of Humans with Stored Autologous Marrow\\" in an effort to expand his research to investigate the palliative effects of bone marrow extraction and reinfusion. While the FCR initially deemed the plan inadequate for not properly informing the patients of potential risks of the treatment, a revised proposal in 1967 entitled ‚ÄúThe Therapeutic Effect of Total Body Irradiation Followed by Infusion of Stored Autologous Marrow in Humans‚Äù received varying levels of approval by the members of the FCR. Dr. George Shields claimed the mortality rate of the experiments at that point in the experiments (25%) was too high, stating that if the proposal was to be approved, the patients would have to be explicitly told of the ‚Äú1 in 4 chance of death within a few weeks due to treatment.‚ÄùEgilman, David (1998).

The FCR did not follow up on its provisions, however, until 1970, when it deemed the experimental protocol to be inadequate, particularly with regard to the effectiveness of the bone marrow infusions in alleviating the debilitating effects of the total body irradiation. Even so, the FCR reapproved the experiments on August 9, 1971.United States. Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (1996). The Human Radiation Experiments. USA: Oxford University Press. pp. 243-244. In April 1972, another proposal entitled ‚ÄúEvaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness of total and partial body irradiation as compared to chemotherapy in humans with carcinoma of the lung and colon‚Äù was sent to the FCR, but the president of the University of Cincinnati soon terminated the contract between the DOD and the UC researchers in a deal with Senator Edward Kennedy following negative press coverage of the experiments.United States.

The new protocol was put on hold until August 1972, when it was finally approved by the FCR as part of a grant proposal sent to the National Institutes of Health. The NIH, however, rejected the proposal in February 1973, cutting off all outside funds for the experiments.  Press Coverage and Department of Defense Contract Termination (1971-1972)  Dr. Saenger's contract with the Department of Defense first gained public attention when the Washington Post broke the story on October 8, 1971, following investigative journalism by Roger Rapoport.Stephens, Martha (2002).

Three days later, the University of Cincinnati held a news conference on the experiments, which prompted three separate investigations of the experiments by the American College of Radiology, the Ad Hoc Review Committee of the University of Cincinnati, and the Junior Faculty Association of the University of Cincinnati, whose reports were all published in January, 1972.United States.

The Junior Faculty Association's report, entitled ‚ÄúReport to the Campus Community,‚Äù was written by Martha Stephens, an English professor at the University of Cincinnati. Stephens based the report on Dr. Saenger's progress reports sent to the DOD, which were released to Stephens by Dr. Edwall Gall, the then Director of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.Stephens, Martha (2002).

The JFA's report evolved into a news conference on January 25, 1972,Stephens, Martha (2002). The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 5. which prompted the Washington Post to publish the JFA's report's findings the next day.Stephens, Martha (2002). The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 11. While Dr. Saenger and Dr. Silberstein criticized the JFA's report, asserting that ‚Äúthe only unfavorable comments had come from a handful of local, and non-medical junior faculty members‚Äù in their unpublished article ‚ÄúEthics on Trial: Medical, Congressional and Journalistic,‚ÄùStephens, Martha (2002). The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 14. the report and the accompanying Washington Post article drew Senator Edward Kennedy's attention, who was already investigating medical experimentation in the United States. As part of his investigation of the Cincinnati Radiation Experiments, Senator Kennedy sought interviews with the patients, an effort resisted by Dr. Saenger and Dr. Silberstein. In April 1972, Senator Kennedy, Ohio governor John Gilligan, and Warren Bennis, the then president of the University of Cincinnati, met and agreed to halt the political investigations of the Cincinnati Radiation Experiments if the contract between the UC researchers and the Department of Defense was terminated.  Renewed Press Coverage and Congressional Hearing (1993-1994)  Although initially fading from public eye after the termination of the DOD contract and the discontinuation of the Kennedy investigation, the Cincinnati Radiation Experiments resurfaced in November 1993 as a result of Eileen Welsome's investigative journalism in the Albuquerque Tribune. While primarily concerned with the Cold War tests at Los Alamos, Welsome's articles prompted the Department of Energy to renew investigations of Cold War human experimentation, and in January 1994, Cincinnati's WKRC Channel 12 news contacted Martha Stephens, the original author of the JFA report. WKRC then aired a program featuring a debate between Stephens, who attacked the experiments, and Congressman David S. Mann, who defended the experiments and the Cincinnati General Hospital.Stephens, Martha (2002). The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 16-19. Following this televised program was a tide of local press coverage which led to the Cincinnati Radiation Experiment's story being covered in the New York Times.Stephens, Martha (2002). The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 20. According to Martha Stephens, the widespread publicity forced David Mann to reverse his political position on the experiments to appeal to his constituents in the upcoming 1994 Congressional Democratic primary election, and David Mann soon called for a Congressional hearing on the experiments.Stephens, Martha (2002). The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 19.

The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 111. A primary concern of the hearing was to evaluate whether or not the families of the patients should be monetarily compensated.  Trials (1994-1999)  The renewed publicity also prompted Martha Stephens and Laura Schneider, a graduate student at the University of Cincinnati, to investigate the identities of the patients and their family members.Stephens, Martha (2002). The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 22. Bob Newman, a human rights attorney, agreed to represent the identified families in a class action lawsuit filed on February 17, 1994 against the individual researchers, the University of Cincinnati, and the City of Cincinnati. In the lawsuit, the families alleged that the experiments violated the patients‚Äô rights to due process of law, equal protection under the law, privacy, and access to the courts. Although the individual researchers sought immunity as ‚Äúpublicly employed physicians,‚Äù District Court Judge Sandra Beckwith dismissed the defendants‚Äô claims, citing the Nuremberg Code's ethical guidelines for human experimentation established in the Nuremberg Nazi doctor trials following World War II.Stephens, Martha (2002).

The United States of America vs. Karl Brandt et al. US Military Tribunal Nuremberg, Judgement of 19 July 1947. After numerous hearings in In Re Cincinnati Radiation Litigation, on May 4, 1999, Judge Beckwith settled the case for over $4 million, paid by the University, the City, and the individual researchers. In addition to the settlement, the trial demanded the creation of a memorial plaque for the patients of the Cincinnati Radiation Experiments.Stephens, Martha (2002). The Treatment: The Story of Those Who Died in the Cincinnati Radiation Tests. Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 289. In October 1999, the plaque with the words ‚ÄúIn Memoriam: Radiation Effects Study 1960-1972‚Äù was erected near the building of the Cincinnati General Hospital where the experiments were performed. However, in June 2001, the building housing the General Hospital was demolished to construct a parking garage, and the plaque was moved to a courtyard near the current University Hospital's outpatient treatment clinic.

He was known to have held the positions of royal adviser and master of the horse. His cruel treatment of serfs sparked the Croatian‚ÄìSlovene Peasant Revolt.  Family  His father J√°nos Tahy held the title of Ban of Croatia in 1524, and died when Ferenc was 10 years old. He was married to Jelena, the sister of famous Croatian nobleman and war general Nikola IV Zrinski. His daughter Margareta was married to P√©ter Erd≈ëdy, Ban of Croatia from 1556 to 1567. Tahy also had a son named G√°bor.Koropec, Jo≈æe, ≈†tatenberg i seljaƒçka buna, Radovi zavoda za hrvatsku povijest vol 5 no1, 1973., page 155 - 157  Biography  Tahy distinguished himself in the wars against the Ottoman Turks, for which he was appointed commander of the royal army in southern Hungary as well as the commander of strongholds in Szigetv√°r and Kanizsa. After his estates in Slavonia and Hungary were seized by the Ottomans in 1556., he acquired new estates in Stattenberg, Styria and in 1564, one half of the Susedgrad-Stubica seigniory, the former estate of the B√°thory family. This acquisition brought him into confrontation with the Henning family who owned the other half of the Susedgrad-Stubica seigniory. In 1565, using the help of local peasants, the Hennings drove out Tahy and his family and defeated the viceroy's army that was sent there to help the Tahys reclaim their new estates. The seigniory was soon confiscated by the Hungarian Royal Chamber. Tahy confronted the Chamber's manager, which resulted in the leasing of the seigneury back to Tahy in 1569. Soon after, a series of rebellions broke out there.  Role in Croatian-Slovene Peasant Revolt  Ferenc Tahy's treatment of Croatian peasants was traditionally known as the key factor which led to the Croatian-Slovene Peasant revolt, although modern historiography emphasizes other causes as crucial factors that caused the rebellion, most notably economic ones.  Death  After the rebellion was crushed, Tahy was seriously ill, but nevertheless continued harassing the peasants. At that point he ordered himself a tombstone which is kept today in Museum of The Peasant Rebellion of 1573 at Castle Or≈°iƒá, Stubica, Croatia. Upon his death, Tahy was buried in the church of the Holy Trinity in Donja Stubica.  In popular culture  Tahy was portrayed by Serbian actor Pavle Vuisiƒá in Yugoslav/Croatian historical war movie Anno Domini 1573. Croatian heavy metal band Podne Rogato made a song named \\"Franjo Tahi\\" dedicated to him.

She wrote two books based on her travels, Eminent Missionary Women and Woman's Medical Work in Mission Fields. The history of the literature produced by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church was closely linked with Gracey, who served as chairman of the committee on literature, and created missionary literature for the Society. She died in Clifton Springs, New York in 1908. Early years and education Annie Ryder was born in Christiana, Delaware, November 4, 1836. She attended the Wilmington Female College, from which she graduated at the age of sixteen. Career Annie Gracey =Missionary= For four years, she taught in her alma mater school. On March 10, 1858, at the age of 22, she married Rev. John Talbot Gracey. In 1861 they were appointed to India and stationed at Sitapur. There, Gracey gathered a few local girls together \\"forming the nucleus of the great work now carried on by the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society.\\" On the veranda of their native house, Mrs. Gracey began the first girls' school in Sitapur. Eventually they added to this compound the Sitapur Girls' School with about 100 pupils and the Annie Ryder Gracey Home for missionaries. The Graceys subsequently settled in Bareilly, and then in Naini Tal, remaining in India for seven years, before returning to the US in 1868. =Activist= In 1868, Mrs. Gracey returned home with Dr. Gracey and when the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society was formed, in 1869, she at once identified herself with it, organizing the Philadelphia Branch. In 1878, she was elected recording secretary of the General Executive Committee, which office she filled for 24 years. In 1883, when Dr. Gracey returned to Genesee Conference, Mrs. Gracey was elected Conference Secretary, which office she held until 1905. Though she was a member of the First Church of Rochester, her influence was interdenominational. At the Ecumenical Conference in 1900, Gracey represented the women of Methodism, on the Committee. She was appointed because of her wide and profound knowledge of missions, to help prepare a seven years interdenominational course of study, covering the entire subject of Protestant Missions. =Literature of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society= Medical Work of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society Eminent Missionary Women The history of the literature of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society was closely linked with Gracey, serving as chairman of the committee on literature and creating missionary literature for the Society. As early as 1877, she saw the demand for a larger provision for this department, and the leaflets, booklets and reports that she wrote and produced make an impressive record. Under Gracey's direction, it developed from nothing to millions of pages annually. In her home, for years, she ran a \\"leaflet room\\" devoted to the Society's publications. Not only did she write many of the leaflets, but she also attended to the printing and mailing, sending every package herself for many years. The Study under her editorial charge became an established part in missionary education. An excellent record of woman's medical work in mission fields was written by her. Woman's Medical Work in Mission Fields, and she also published a book on Eminent Missionary Women, besides doing much general writing for various periodicals. As recording secretary of the General Executive Committee, a position she held for 223 years, she prepared the Annual Report of the Society, which required intimate knowledge of the details of the work and a lot of time in its preparation. She also furnished a quadrennial statement to the General Conference of the work in all parts of the world. Personal life The son, W. A. Gracey, was editor of the Geneva Daily Times.

It was launched on June 12, 1990. Importance of INSAT-1D satellite  Similar to all other INSAT systems, INSAT-1D was also a joint venture of DOS (Department of Space), DOT (Department of Telecommunications), IMD (Indian Meteorological Department), AIR (All India Radio). The objectives of INSAT-1D were meteorological observations over India and the Indian Ocean, and search & rescue services, domestic telecommunications (nationwide direct TV broadcasting, TV program distribution, meteorological data distribution, etc.). Meteorological Data Utilization Center (MDUC, at Delhi), under IMD, was authorized for the dissemination and distribution of INSAT meteorological images and ancillary data. Master Control Facility of DOS was decided to take responsibility for the operation of the INSAT space segment. But the success of this launch meant a lot to India - a country that was setting up own national computer networks. Relying on a lot of communication circuits, microwave, coaxial and fibre-optic telecommunication links throughout the country causes a huge problem; and thus the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) planned at the start of the INSAT-1 series to always have at least two satellites in space to meet the increasing demand of telecommunication links for India's civilian community. INSAT-1A and INSAT-1C had already faced immature death and their plans had suffered a serious setback. Another satellite INSAT-1B, launched in 1983 had already exceeded its planned seven year working life. Launch INSAT 1D was built by Ford Aerospace (now Loral Inc) for the Indian National Satellite System. Initially, the launch was scheduled on 29 June 1989. Unfortunately, 10 days before that, during launch preparation, a launch pad hoist cable broke and a crane hook fell on it damaging its C-band reflector. The fully insured satellite was repaired by Ford Aerospace at a reported cost of $10 million. But that mishap was followed solar panel damage of cost $150,000 suffered during the 1989 San Francisco earthquake. The satellite was finally Delta-launched from Cape Canaveral, United States. It had a 7-year life expectancy. Structure The satellite was box-shaped, measuring . A solar sail and solar panel extended overall length to when deployed. It was housed 12 C-band transponders for telephone and data communications and two S-band transponders for direct broadcast service. A very high resolution radiometer (VHRR) was installed for meteorological imagery for long-term weather forecasting, storm warning and resource management. INSAT-1D played a vital role in replacing INSAt-1B. Moreover, at that moment India already had hired Arabsat's 12 transponders at high cost (the rate of $800,000 per transponder per year). Failure of 1D mission would compel the government to hire more transponders.

Constructed in 1962 and completed in 1963, The Lake Michigan High-Rises (CHA) originally consisted of four 16‚Äìstory buildings; totaling 457 units. The Lake Michigan High-Rises (CHA) was located west of Lake Shore Drive and was included as a part of the CHA Lakefront Properties. Today, only two buildings of the Lakefront Properties exist; they were officially renamed from Victor Olander Homes to Lake Parc Place in 1991.

The first three buildings (1132 E. 42nd Street, 1130 E. 41st Street and 4155 S. Lake Park Avenue) sat 16‚Äìstories high in a u‚Äìshape cluster (also known as the Horseshoe buildings)South Street Journal ‚Äì August 24, 1994 bordered by Lake Park Avenue to the west and Oakenwald Avenue to the east. The other buildings (4040 S. Oakenwald Avenue, which sat 30 yards north from the clustered buildings), and the Victor Olander Homes (which still stands today north of the former Oakenwald building site.) The Lake Michigan High-Rises (CHA) were occupied until December 1985; when all but the one building at Oakenwald Avenue were vacated (which was later vacated in January 1986). In May 1985, The Chicago Housing Authority told the residents the buildings would undergo renovation in the coming months and residents would have to be relocated to other CHA sites. Prior to the proposed renovation plans, Residents were opposed to the relocation; fearing they wouldn't be able to return to the buildings. The authority received $14 million grant from Housing of Urban Development (HUD) to begin the renovation process in December 1985. Eleven families at the Oakenwald building refused to leave. According to residents, The housing authority began the process of forcing them out by extreme measures. The authority turned off heat and electricity in the building, Elevators stopped working and pipes burst which led to water freezing on the stairwells. After the electricity and water was turned off, Residents vacated the building in mid-January 1986.Washington Park: The Dying Hope In December 1987, Developer Ferd Kramer submitted a plan to CHA; proposing to demolish four of the six buildings to build new low‚Äìrise housing in the area. The Illinois Housing And Development Authority supported Kramer's plan.

In 1983, he received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Chicago. Professor Landis has a strong background in organic and inorganic chemistry. He is currently a professor in the Department of Chemistry in the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Research Focuses Landis's research focuses on the asymmetric hydroformylation (AHF) of alkenes and alkynes through rhodium-based (Rh) catalysts with phosphine ligands. Rh catalysts with bisdiazaphospholane (BDP) ligands, shown in Figure 2, could convert substrates into highly enantio- and regio-specific aldehyde products. Landis and co-workers are also the inventors and patent holders of BDP and other diazaphosphacycle metal complexes. AHF Hydroformylation (AHF) converts alkenes to aldehydes. AHF has a wide range of industrial applications, including synthesizing linear aliphatic aldehydes. For example, making butanal from propene. Also, AHF is commercially used to synthesize aromatic aldehydes, including anti- inflammatory agents: ibuprofen and naproxen. Figure 1: General Asymmetric Hydroformylation reaction of olefins to produce aldehydes. AHF is Stereospecific Wilkinson and Brown first discovered Rh-based catalysts in the 70s‚Äô. AHF of alkenes with Rh-based catalysts could yield high ratio of linear chain to branched chain aldehydes. Recent work from Landis group showed how AHF of non-linear compounds with Rh-based catalysts can produce stereospecific aldehydes. Rh-BDP Catalysts and Alkenes AHFs of alkenes, specifically enol esters and enamides, with Rh-BDP catalysts yield high concentration of stereo and regio-specific aldehydes. Adding extra functional groups to the alkenes does not interfere with specificity or degree of AHF. AHF is Affected by CO Concentration_ Complex alkenes with multiple branches and/or multiple chiral centers are more difficult to go through stereospecific AHF, compared to linear alkenes. NMR and IR spectroscopies indicate olefin substrates often rearrange their more substituted chains or carbonyl groups to increase the compounds' thermodynamic stability. CO concentration also affects the rate and probability of isomerization. CO concentration and the relatively complex reaction steps make assigning specific steps in metal-ligand catalyzed AHF as a rate or product determinant a more difficult task. AHF is Affected by Pressure Pressure also affects AHF of olefins by altering the kinetics in the reaction pathways. For example, styrene is converted to linear isomers under lower pressure but branched isomers under higher pressure. Synthesis of BDP Ligand Bisdiazaphospholane (BDP) on Rh increases reactivity and enantioselectivity of olefin AHF. However, BDP is difficult to purify in its enantiopure form through common purification techniques, such as, column chromatography. Jones recently synthesized BDP, resulting in a scalable and commercial production. The processes include the synthesis of racemic mixture of tetracarboxylic acid, separation of an enantiomer by selective recrystallization of diastereomeric salts, amide bond formation, and crystallization of purified BDP. These processes produce high yield of pure BDP, so greater modification of Rh-BDP catalysts could enhance alkene AHF. Figure 2: Bisdiazaphospholane (BDP), the ligand for Rh-based catalyst. AHF Products Prediction A library of BDP derivatives with specific chiral center arrangement and substituents was made to study AHF on olefins. Structure of BDP affects the degree of enantio-, regio- selectivity, and branched:linear ratio of aldehyde products on a wide range of olefin reactants, including 2,3-dihydrofuran and styrene. The data collected helps with predicting the possible aldehyde products from olefin of interest. Rh Catalyst can be Used to Synthesis Polyester Rh-based catalysts also polymerize carboxylic acids into oligo(2-hydroxyacid) s through hydroacyloxylation with alkynes. The oligomer is then modified to remove the alkenyl groups. AHF then converts the oligomer to aldehydes. This novel approach of polyester synthesis needs further adjustments to improve its efficiency so it may be industrially applicable.

Life and career  Klimek was born in Melbourne, Australia. His mother, Luisa n√©e Cester (born 29 January 1916 in Pasiano di Pordenone) was a daughter of the couple Eugenia and Ernesto Cester. In the Summer of 1940 she left Friuli-Venezia Giulia for Australia. After the Second World War, she married Alfons Klimek (died 1998) and gave birth to eight children: Eugenia, Lydia, Naomi (born 1953), Greta, Alfons junior, Robert, and twins Jayney and Johnny (born August 1962). Her sister, Fanny Cester (1921‚Äì1988), emigrated to Australia in 1937 and married racing cyclist Nino Borsari in 1940. The Klimek family lived in various Melbourne suburbs including Kew, Oakleigh and, from 1969, Clayton. Klimek's younger cousins, Nic and Chris Cester, were founding mainstays of Australian hard rockers, Jet (2001‚Äì12). Johnny worked in a number of local garage bands before emigrating to Berlin in 1983, where he started the pop rock band The Other Ones with his sister Jayney and brother Alf. He became active in the Berlin underground trance/ambient/techno scene, and collaborated with Paul Browse of the band Clock DVA on a short-lived musical project, Effective Force. He served as the bass player for singer Nina Hagen's 1996 tour. Klimek has produced numerous film scores with composer Reinhold Heil, beginning with the 1997 film Winter Sleepers. Since then, they have become regular collaborators of its director, Tom Tykwer, and have provided the score to almost all of his films since, including the score to Perfume, Story Of A Murderer. Klimek, Heil, and Tykwer were nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for their critically acclaimed score to the latter's 2012 epic science fiction film Cloud Atlas. He has also worked on television series such as Without a Trace, Deadwood, The Newsroom, and Sense8, thriller films such as Run Lola Run and One Hour Photo, horror films such as Land of the Dead and Blood & Chocolate, and action films like Killer Elite and I, Frankenstein.

The gens Petillia or Petilia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens first appear in history at the beginning of the second century BC, and the first to obtain the consulship was Quintus Petillius Spurinus in 176 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 212 (\\"Petillia or Petilia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Petillius, also spelled Petilius, Petelius, and Petellius, is almost certainly derived from the cognomen Petilus, meaning \\"slender\\", and belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the typically diminutive suffixes -illius and -ellius.Chase, p. 124. The name is regularly confused with that of the Poetelii, an older plebeian family that occurs from the time of the Decemvirs down to the period of the Samnite Wars, but they do not appear to have been the same. Branches and cognomina The only surnames of the Petillii in the time of the Republic were Capitolinus and Spurinus, of which only the former occurs on coins. A number of Petillii are found without cognomina. Spurinus, belonging to one of the earliest Petillii appearing in history, appears to be connected with the Etruscan gentile Spurina, hinting at an Etruscan origin of the gens, or perhaps a maternal ancestor of the Petillii.Chase, p. 114. An alternative explanation might be as a diminutive of the praenomen Spurius, which the Etruscan scholar Wilhelm Deecke discussed in connection with similar Etruscan names. Although Deecke noted the use of the praenomen Spurie by the Etruscans, the orthography used in Greek transliterations argued in favour of a Latin origin.Deecke, pp. 327‚Äì329. The cognomen Capitolinus is said to have been bestowed upon one of the Petillii who was caretaker of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill in the time of Augustus. However, Capitolinus was a relatively common surname, typically signifying someone who lived on the Capitol.Chase, pp. 113, 114. Coins this family depicts the Temple of Jupiter on the reverse, while the obverses depict either a head of Jupiter, or an eagle, as a symbol of Jupiter.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 605 (\\"Petillius Capitolinus\\"). Members * Quintus Petillius C. f. Q. n. Spurinus, as tribune of the plebs in 187 BC, accused Scipio Africanus of having accepted a bribe to deal leniently with Antiochus, and called for an investigation of others suspected of having been bribed by Antiochus. He was praetor urbanus in 181, when he ordered the destruction of some books that were claimed to have belonged to Numa Pompilius. Consul in 176, he was slain in battle against the Ligures.Livy, xxxviii. 50, 54, 56, xl. 29, xli. 14‚Äì18.Valerius Maximus, i. 1. ¬ß 12; 5 ¬ß 9, ii. 7. ¬ß 15.Pliny the Elder, xiii. 14. s. 27.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Numa\\", 22.Aurelius Victor, De Viris Illustribus, 49.Augustine, De Civitate Dei, vii. 34.Obsequens, 64.Fasti Capitolini, .Broughton, vol.

How the two Petillii were related is unknown.Livy, xxxviii. 50, 54, 56. * Lucius Petillius, a scribe who lived at the foot of the Janiculum. In 181 BC, workmen on his land discovered two stone chests, one of which claimed to be the sarcophagus of Numa Pompilius, while the other was supposed to contain his books. No trace of a body was found, but the books were examined and then ordered destroyed by Quintus Petillius Spurinus, the praetor urbanus.Livy, xl. 29. * Lucius Petillius, one of the ambassadors imprisoned by Gentius in 168 BC, and freed following that king's defeat by the praetor Lucius Anicius Gallus.Livy, xliv. 27, 32.Appian, Macedonica, xvi. 1.Broughton, vol.

Both nations are members of the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language, Organization of Ibero-American States and the United Nations. History =Spanish colonization= Stamp from Spanish Guinea The first Europeans to explore the island of Fernando Po and Annob√≥n were the Portuguese who arrived in 1472. In 1778, Portugal ceded the territory to Spain after the signing of the Treaty of El Pardo. These cessions were made so that Spain would have access to slaves for Spanish America and at the same time, it recognized the rights of the Portuguese west of the 50¬∞ W meridian in present-day Brazil.British Britannica: History of Equatorial Guinea Spain controlled its new territory, called Spanish Guinea, from its Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata based in Buenos Aires. By 1781, Spain withdrew from the territory after many of the Spanish settlers and soldiers were decimated by yellow fever. In 1827, Spain leased the island of Fernando Po to the British Royal Navy who required a base to watch for slavers after they abolished the slave trade in 1807. By 1844, Spain took control of its territory and began to use it as a penal settlement for Cubans. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the territory of Spanish Guinea was the last significant territory of Spain. After the Spanish Civil War, in 1959, Spanish Guinea was reorganized into two provinces of overseas Spain and placed under civil governors and the residents of Spanish Guinea were given full Spanish citizenship. By 1963, Spanish Guinea was given some economic and administrative autonomy. =Independence= In the 1960s, there was a movement for the decolonisation of Africa. In 1967, residents of Spanish Guinea began demanding independence. In early 1968, the Spanish government suspended autonomous political control over the territory and proposed a national referendum over a new constitution. The constitution was approved on 11 August by Spanish Guinean residents and on 12 October 1968, Spanish Guinea declared its independence and changed its name to Equatorial Guinea. Spain immediately recognized the new nation and established diplomatic relations.Relaciones Bilaterales entre Espa√±a y Guinea Ecuatorial (in Spanish) That same year, Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema became the first President of the newly independent nation. By 1969, all Spanish troops and most of the Spanish community left the country for Spain.Cuatrocientos sesenta espa√±oles llegan a Tenerife (in Spanish) =Post Independence= In March 1977, Spain suspended diplomatic relations with Equatorial Guinea due to repression by President Nguema and his verbal attacks against the Spanish government.Espa√±a suspende las relaciones diplom√°ticas con Guinea Ecuatorial (in Spanish) In October 1978, relations between both nations dipped to an all-time low when President Nguema, who took absolute power in the country, began to send entire families and villages to their execution or to migrant camps. Spain was prepared to send troops to the nation to intervene and evacuate its citizens if they were particularly targeted by President Nguema.Espa√±a, preparada para intervenir en Guinea Ecuatorial en defensa de los s√∫bditos espa√±oles (in Spanish) In August 1979, a coup d'√©tat was led by Lieutenant Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the nephew of President Nguema.

She is the Ford of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a permanent external member of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG), and a faculty associate at the Center for European Studies (CES) at Harvard University. She received her B.A. from the University of Kansas before obtaining both an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. She is a leading authority on the origins and evolution of political-economic institutions in the rich democracies. She is among the most highly cited political scientists. Thelen completed and published her first book, ‚ÄúUnion of Parts‚Äù, as an Assistant Professor at Princeton University in 1991. Through an analysis of labor relations in Germany between the 1970s and 1980s, she identified the interaction of centralized bargaining and German work councils as the institutional basis for peaceful, negotiated adjustment in the midst of radical economic and political change. After moving to Northwestern University in 1994, Thelen wrote a sole-authored article, ‚ÄúHistorical Institutionalism in Comparative Politics,‚Äù for the Annual Review of Political Science. The article instantly became a classic, and to date scholars have referenced it more than 6,000 times. In ‚ÄúHow Institutions Evolve‚Äù (2004), Thelen examines variations in the nineteenth century settlements between employers and skill-intensive workers, artisans, and early trade unions. She finds that the effects of these settlements were incremental, and can only be understood by making sense of specific types of long-run gradual change. For example, she discovered that German Handicraft Protection Law of 1897, originally designed to shore up support among a reactionary artisanal class, was a historical cause of contemporary Germany‚Äôs vocational training system. The book co-received the American Political Science Association‚Äôs Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award for the best book published in 2004 on government, politics, or international affairs. Thelen left Northwestern University for MIT in 2009. In 2014, she published her third major substantive book, ‚ÄúVarieties of Liberalization and the New Politics of Social Solidarity.‚Äù The book examines contemporary changes in labor market institutions in the United States, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. While confirming a broad, shared, liberalizing trend, Thelen finds that there are in fact distinct varieties of liberalization associated with very different distributive outcomes. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, her study reveals that the successful defense of the institutions traditionally associated with coordinated capitalism has often been a recipe for increased inequality due to declining coverage and dualization. Conversely, she argues that some forms of labor market liberalization are perfectly compatible with continued high levels of social solidarity and indeed may be necessary to sustain it. The book received prizes from section in both the American Political Science Association (APSA) and the American Sociological Association (ASA). She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015 and to the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2009. She has been awarded honorary degrees at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (2013), the London School of Economics (2017), the European University Institute in Florence (2018) and, most recently, the University of Copenhagen (2018).

Ecklund was said to have exhibited symptoms akin to possession beginning at age fourteen, and was forty six-years-old during her final exorcism by Father Theophilus Riesinger, a German Roman Catholic priest. Ecklund's case is considered by theology and paranormal scholars to be one of the most abundantly documented cases of possession in the 20th century, including a profile in a 1936 issue of Time magazine. Early life Emma Schmidt was born in Wisconsin on March 23, 1882 and raised in a Catholic household in Marathon.Ghosts and Demons: The Lost Things - KyL Cobb - Google Books Retrieved 2018-10-05. According to Wisconsin birth records, both of Schmidt's parents were German immigrants. She reportedly began exhibiting signs of possession during her adolescence, demonstrating revulsion of holy objects, \\"disturbed\\" thoughts, and inability to enter churches. Ecklund also began to take part in \\"unspeakable sexual acts.\\" According to an account published in 1935, the believed source of Ecklund's possession was her aunt Mina, a reputed local witch who placed spells on herbs she would prepare Ecklund's food with. Mina was purportedly also a lover of Ecklund's father. Exorcisms & Death On June 18, 1912, Ecklund underwent an exorcism by Father Theophilus Riesinger, a Capuchin priest originally from Bavaria, Germany, entrusted by Bishop Thomas Dunn of Des Moines, Iowa. Riesinger had been a monk at the community of St. Anthony's in Marathon, Wisconsin. Little was documented concerning this initial exorcism; however, Ecklund was not consulted for over two decades after the 1912 exorcism. In the summer of 1928, Riesinger was again consulted to perform a second exorcism on Ecklund. Father Joseph Stieger of Earling, Iowa, a friend of Riesinger, suggested the exorcism be undertaken at a convent owned by the Franciscan Sisters in Earling. Ecklund was taken to the convent on August 17, 1928, and reportedly exhibited numerous symptoms, including falling into fits of rage over food that had been sprinkled with holy water, and hissing like a cat. With the help of the Franciscan sisters of the convent, the exorcism began on August 18. The exorcism was reportedly violent, with Ecklund levitating, howling, and hanging from the frame of the doorway. The first session lasted until August 26; a second session occurred between September 13 and September 20, followed by a final eight-day session that lasted from December 15 to December 23, 1928. The extensive exorcism resulted in deterioration of Ecklund's body, as she refused to consume food, also vomiting foul debris and what appeared to be tobacco leaves. Her head, lips, and face reportedly swelled, and she also was able to speak in multiple languages unknown to her. The exorcism was reportedly so grueling, and Ecklund's behavior so violent, that several nuns in the Franciscan order asked to be relocated to a different convent. Ecklund was believed to be possessed by Judas Iscariot, as well as Jacob, her own father, who had cursed her with the help of his lover, her aunt Mina, for refusing his incestuous sexual advances during her adolescence. During the exorcisms, Ecklund also spoke in a high falsetto voice, which Riesinger interpreted as the voice of her aunt Mina. On December 23, the final day of the exorcism, Father Riesinger commanded the demons in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary to depart to Hell. Ecklund collapsed on her bed and began to shriek, \\"Beelzebub, Judas, Jacob, Mina,\\" followed by, \\"Hell! Hell! Hell!\\" She opened her eyes, and then spoke in her own voice, saying: \\"My Jesus, Mercy! Praised be Jesus Christ!\\" Riesinger's exorcism was reportedly successful, and Ecklund only exhibited \\"milder\\" and \\"quite manageable\\" possessions after it. Her true identity was kept protected from the public in written accounts. Anna Ecklund died on July 23rd 1941 at age 59. In culture In 2016, a fictionalized British-produced film entitled The Exorcism of Anna Ecklund was released, documenting her possession and exorcism. =Published accounts= Carl Vogl, a theologian, wrote an account of the possession in German, titled Begone, Satan, in 1935, using the pseudonym Anna Ecklund. According to Francis Young, a theology scholar, elements of the account published by Vogl were repeated in a written account of a thirteen-year-old possessed boy, Robbie Mannheim, in Mount Rainier, Maryland, in 1949 by Jesuit priests. Young views the publication of the Ecklund case as integral in exemplifying the \\"American exorcism.\\" In February 1936, the 1928 exorcism was also profiled in Time magazine.

The channel first launched on September 26, 2005, originally a joint venture between PBS, Comcast, Sesame Workshop, and HIT Entertainment, devoted to children's television programming aimed at a preschool audience. Following Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal, the company gradually bought out the remaining owners' shares in the channel, reaching full ownership in 2013. The network's operations were subsequently relocated from Philadelphia to New York City, and the \\"PBS Kids\\" name was dropped from its branding. On September 9, 2017, the network rebranded as Universal Kids (derived from sister film studio Universal Pictures), and began to devote its evening and primetime lineup to programming targeting a youth audience, including DreamWorks Animation content, unscripted programming (including game shows, and youth spin-offs of reality series from its sister networks, such as American Ninja Warrior and Top Chef), and imported series from other countries. Universal Kids continues to air a block of preschool programming during its daytime schedule. As of January 2016, the channel was available to approximately 56 million American pay television households (48.2% of households with television) in the United States (when it was still primarily known as Sprout). Background Universal Kids traces its origins to the PBS Kids network (referred to as the PBS Kids Channel in press materials), which launched on September 6, 1999 coinciding with the rebranding of PTV, PBS‚Äô children's programming block, to PBS Kids that day. The PBS Kids feed was available on high-tier subscription providers, and was also offered to PBS member stations for use on a \\"cablecast\\" service (a subscription-based local channel provided by the member station) or for use on the member station's free-to-air analog channel to provide a portion of the daytime PBS Kids programming on the station. Participating stations were required to pay an annual fee of $1,000 to use the feed. At launch, 32 PBS member stations had signed up to use the service. The channel was created, in part, to compete against Nick Jr. and its sister network Noggin. Because the pay TV rights to the Children's Television Workshop's program library were owned by Noggin (which CTW owned a 50% interest in at the time), the channel did not broadcast any CTW programming, including Sesame Street, a longtime staple of PBS' children's programming, with the exception of Dragon Tales (which premiered during the PTV era). The channel was unsuccessful and had only reached 9 million households as of 2002, compared to Noggin's 23.3 million households at the time. Once the channel shut down on September 26, 2005 (alongside PBS YOU), many member stations which had been using the PBS Kids channel on their cablecast channels or free-to-air digital subchannels continued to operate their children's channels as local services scheduled independently of a satellite feed, while other member stations shut down their kids channels entirely and redirected viewers of those channels to the newly launched PBS Kids Sprout. PBS later revived the PBS Kids Channel on January 16, 2017, this time being structured as a multi-platform service with an online streaming option in addition to utilizing largely the same distribution methods that had been used for the original channel. History =As PBS Kids Sprout/Sprout (2005‚Äì2017)=  PBS era  Former logo used as PBS Kids Sprout from September 26, 2005 to November 12, 2013. On October 20, 2004, PBS announced that it had entered into a joint partnership with cable provider Comcast, and production companies HIT Entertainment and Sesame Workshop to launch a then- unnamed subscription-based channel aimed at preschool children. On April 4, 2005, Comcast announced that the network would be known as PBS Kids Sprout, launching initially as a branded video on-demand (VOD) service before launching its linear pay-TV channel. The network would be advertising- supported, but ads would only air between programs in small quantities, and would be aimed towards parents and caregivers. The linear network officially launched on September 26, 2005, with a reach of around 16 million viewers across Comcast and Insight cable providers. The multi-platform approach was designed to appeal to different viewing habits, with the linear channel focused on variety, and the on-demand services focused on instantaneous access to specific programs. The linear service was designed around dayparted programming blocks, featuring activities and other feature segments presented by on-air hosts. Some of these segments were designed to promote supplemental content (including activities and interactive features) on Sprout's website. Sprout chose to not follow the convention of bundling short-form series into half-hour episodes with interstitial segments for U.S. broadcast, electing to air such programs individually in their original format. Andrew Beecham, a former director of worldwide programming strategy for the Playhouse Disney brand, stated that with this practice, \\"you get to sample a huge variety of material. You'll get all these smaller shows that translate into something bigger.\\" In September 2010, PBS Kids Sprout launched a high definition simulcast feed. Effects of Comcast/NBCUniversal merger (NBC era) Final Sprout logo used from November 13, 2013 to September 8, 2017. However, between 2008 and 2013, this logo was previously used in tandem with the original PBS Kids Sprout logo. Comcast acquired a 51% majority stake of NBCUniversal in January 2011, and would assume full ownership of the company in 2013. As a result, Comcast's interest in Sprout was turned over to the company. When Apax Partners sold HIT Entertainment to Mattel on October 24, 2011, HIT's ownership interest in Sprout was never included in the deal and was retained by Apax Partners. In December 2012, Sesame Workshop sold its interest in Sprout to NBCUniversal, which in turn later acquired Apax and PBS's shares in the network on March 19, 2013 and November 13, 2013 respectively, therefore giving Comcast full ownership. Its operations were then merged into its NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group subsidiary. As a result of Comcast earning full ownership of the brand, the \\"PBS Kids\\" branding was dropped from the network's name (leaving the network as simply Sprout), and operations were moved from Philadelphia to New York City. On July 7, 2012, Sprout began to produce a Saturday morning block for NBC aimed at preschoolers, NBC Kids, along with MiTelemundo, a Spanish-dubbed version of the block airing on sister network Telemundo that airs on weekend mornings, which replaced Qubo (a recent joint venture between NBCUniversal, Ion Media, Corus Entertainment, Scholastic, and Classic Media, which was later acquired by DreamWorks Animation and is now, in turn, owned by NBCUniversal), which had been airing on NBC and Telemundo since September 2006. Under NBCUniversal ownership, the channel began to shift away from its original focus on library content, and invested more heavily in original programming to displace older, licensed content to better compete with fellow preschool-oriented pay-TV networks Disney Junior and Nick Jr. Under NBCUniversal, programs seen on the network such as The Chica Show earned increased visibility airing on NBC as part of the NBC Kids block. In mid 2016, it was announced that Sandy Wax would be leaving NBCUniversal at the end of 2016. Deirdre Brennan, formerly of Corus Entertainment, was named the new president of Sprout in January 2017. =As Universal Kids (2017‚Äìpresent)= Former Universal Kids logo used from September 9, 2017 to April 11, 2019. On May 1, 2017, NBCUniversal announced that Sprout would rebrand as Universal Kids on September 9, 2017. With the rebranding, the network revamped its evening and primetime programming to aim preteens aged 8‚Äì12. Universal Kids continues to broadcast preschool programming, initially retaining the Sprout brand, occupying 15 hours per-day of programming from 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. LT. Network president Deirdre Brennan claimed that Universal Kids' new programming would be renowned from its competitors, stating that \\"we're offering something to 2 to 12 year olds that has a slightly different purpose ‚Äî widening their eyes, opening their minds and celebrating many aspects of being a kid. We have great [shows] for the preschoolers, which is important, but we needed to grow up with the rest of the family.\\" Universal Kids will initially focus on acquired programs and unscripted series (such as Top Chef Junior, a spin-off of the Bravo reality franchise Top Chef), with plans for scripted original programming in the future. NBCUniversal intended to make \\"significant\\" investments in original content for Universal Kids over the next three years. The launch lineup included a large number of international acquisitions, particularly from the U.K., Australia, and Canada; Brennan acknowledged that since youth audiences had become \\"globally aware\\", the network wanted to showcase foreign series that had not yet aired in the United States. Universal Pictures' acquisition of DreamWorks Animation in 2016 would also be leveraged by Universal Kids to bolster its programming; industry observers felt that the DWA purchase and the launch of Universal Kids were meant to help NBCUniversal establish a viable multi-platform presence in children's media, and give the company a competitor to other major children's networks such as Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel. Universal Kids has also aligned itself with Canada-based DHX Media and its Family, Family Chrgd and Family Jr. television channels by acquiring and co-producing a number of series together. DHX had previously signed a partnership with DreamWorks. The channel has seen a significant decrease in viewership since the relaunch, with Michael Schneider (then of IndieWire) reporting a 30% decline in 2017, followed by a 73% drop in 2018. Brennan was replaced by Frances Berwick as network president in February 2019. On April 12, 2019, Universal Kids unveiled a new logo and branding designed by the design agency Kill 2 Birds. On June 19, 2019, it was reported that in a bid to ensure long- term viability, Universal Kids had ceased developing new original series, leaving it to focus on acquired content, and productions from DWA. The network's then-upcoming original shows, such as the new series Powerbirds, Where's Waldo? and Norman Picklestripes would air as scheduled, along with other upcoming originals such as the DHX co-commissioned Bajillionaires, Create the Escape, and Top Chef Junior: Remix. Programming Original programs produced for the network include the Top Chef youth-oriented spin-off Top Chef Junior, a U.S. edition of the Japanese game show The Noise, a revival of Beat the Clock, and American Ninja Warrior Junior. In addition, following the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation, the channel airs several programs that were originally Netflix-exclusive: All Hail King Julien, DreamWorks Dragons, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show, Noddy, Toyland Detective, The Adventures of Puss in Boots, Dinotrux, and Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh. The Hoobs. The rest of the network's programming is mainly programming from the international children's market. In the summer of 2020, the network began to program marathon 'best-of volume' blocks of one program featuring individual segments for several hours rather than a traditional block of consecutive episodes, emulating the model of the official YouTube channels for mainstream children's series, which either feature a continuous live stream of the series, or an uploaded video several hours in length containing multiple episodes. = Universal Kids Preschool = Universal Kids Preschool serves as the channel's current daytime block, which runs from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time/3:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time (6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time/3:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time). Up until January 26, 2018, the block utilized the network's former name, Sprout. Deirdre Brennan emphasized that Universal Kids would continue to focus on its preschool programming, stating that \\"the greatest thing is, there is nothing to fix there. Sprout is a beautiful brand. If anything, we want to invest more in original production. There is more we can explore there.\\" Prior to the Universal Kids rebranding, the network replaced its long-running morning block Sunny Side Up with Sprout House (renamed Snug's House in 2018), which debuted on August 14, 2017 and is hosted by Carly Ciarrocchi and the new character Snug, a talking dog portrayed by puppeteer Chris Palmieri, through 90-second segments throughout the block. The program was designed to be more flexible to produce than its predecessor, with a different \\"tiny house\\" set with additional areas and camera options. Unlike Sunny Side Up, the segments are pre-recorded instead of broadcast live; supervising producer Vinny Steves felt that the live format was too \\"limiting\\", and stated that the new format was also designed to enable the segments to be distributed on digital platforms such as social media. With the launch of Sprout House, the network began to downplay its longtime mascot, Chica, although she will continue to be featured in certain segments (such as Chica at School). Since 2017, the network has been bringing back older shows that aired on its channel when it was originally known as Sprout. The Wiggles on June 5, 2017, Barney & Friends on December 17, 2018 and The Chica Show on May 20, 2019. However, with the introduction of \\"best-of\\" blocks which take up channel space, this is no longer the case.

He was a Dodge Professor of History and African American studies at Princeton University. Palmer was an author of several monographs pertaining to the history of diasporic Africans. His work mainly focused on the effects of the enslavement and colonization of Africans. The effects that he discusses are known as the African Diaspora . Palmer attended the University of the West Indies for his bachelor's degree, followed by a masters and PH.D from the University of Wisconsin. He went on to teach at several institutions including Oakland University, the University of North Carolina, and the City University of New York. One of his most notable works, Freedom's Children, contains an in-depth overview of British colonialism in Jamaica one hundred years after the ending of slavery, and is centered upon the impact that the Labour Rebellions of 1938 had on the development of working-class consciousness and the collective disposition to act. It provides insight on Alexander Bustamante's association with the imperial regime, together with demonstrating the roles that Bustamante and, his cousin, Norman Manley played in the rise of trade unions and the beginning of party politics in Jamaica. These topics are thoroughly detailed in this work, bringing the harshness of the British regime to light. Colin Palmer's works concerned the history of Blacks from several regions, including Jamaica, Mexico, America, and Africa. In addition to his books, Palmer also published academic articles in journals such as The Black Scholar. He later worked as a managing editor for the Blacks Studies Center and teaches at the University of Princeton. Palmer died in Kingston, Jamaica on June 20, 2019.

Constable and Raymond F. Toliver dedicated to the life and career of the German fighter pilot of World War II, Erich Hartmann. Originally released in the United States in 1970, it was published in Germany the next year, as Holt Hartmann vom Himmel!. The Blond Knight was a commercial success and enjoyed a wide readership among both the American and the German public. The book has been criticised by American and German historians as ahistorical and misleading in recent historiography. Background Trevor J. Constable and Raymond Toliver are American authors who produced 10 non-fiction books on the fighter aces of World War II. Toliver is a former U.S. Air Force pilot and official historian of the American Fighter Aces Association. Criticism The Blond Knight of Germany was criticised by historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies in their work The Myth of the Eastern Front as one of the key works that promoted the myth of the \\"clean Wehrmacht\\". They described the book as a \\"hallmark of romanticization\\", with its \\"insidious\\" title that suggested medieval chivalry that \\"not only fails to characterize the conduct of the Wehrmacht during the Soviet-German war, but, indeed, marks its opposite\\". The historian Klaus Schmider notes that the authors are \\"sympathetic\\" to Hartmann, and that the book \\"tip[s] over into out-and-out hero worship\\". The historian Jens Wehner notes that the German-language version of the book, released in 1971 as Holt Hartmann vom Himmel! Die Geschichte des erfolgreichsten Jagdfliegers der Welt, was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerassen (\\"aces\\") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could be traced to the prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, the political and social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.

Academic career Lee graduated from National Taiwan University with a bachelor's degree in economics and later earned a doctorate in the subject from Ohio State University in the United States. Outside of politics, Lee has taught finance at National Chengchi University. Political career Lee was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 2001 via the People First Party proportional representation party list. In 2004, he was named a defendant in two court cases, as Chen Che-nan and Chang Ching-fang separately charged Lee with libel. Later that year, Lee offered to resign his legislative seat, as PFP chairman James Soong attempted to join the body and engage President Chen Shui-bian in debate. After Lee's first term expired, he was nominated by the People First Party to join the National Communications Commission. In 2011, Lee was again placed on the party list ballot as a PFP legislative candidate. During his second legislative term, Lee served as caucus whip for the People First Party. In November 2012, he attended a student-led protest against the monopolization of media in Taiwan. Lee opposed the 2013 passage of the Senior Secondary Education Act and Junior College Act because he believed that the laws did not allocate enough money to the education system.

It is unusual in having one arm aloft and the other resting on a knee. The part of the figure showing genitalia is less well defined than the upper body, possibly as a result of weathering or an attempt to obscure that part of the image at some time in the past. The Sheela na Gig at Fiddington was examined and brass rubbed by Mick Aston in the late 1970s, Aston who later found fame through the television programme Time Team was at that time county archaeologist for Somerset. He noted that the figure is only one of three currently known in Somerset (the other two are at Wells Cathedral). Aston hinted at a date in the 11th or 12th century for the figure, noting that the stone on which the figure is carved is reddish-purple sandstone and forms a quoin in the south wall which is contemporary with the surrounding herringbone masonry.‚ÄúA Shiela-Na-Gig at Fiddington‚Äú (leaflet) (1977) by Michael Aston BA FSA MIFA The interior includes a 15th-century piscina.

History Most of the information below refers to Shapwick House; somebody needs to sort out this article. The manor of Shapwick originally belonged to Glastonbury Abbey, forming part of its Pouholt (Polden) estate in 729. The building that is known as Shapwick House, not the Manor, was built for the almoner of Glastonbury Abbey in the Middle Ages. A survey in 1327 includes a garden, moat and fishponds. Shapwick House, and not the Manor, dates to around 1475; originally Shapwick House was moated, but the moat was filled in during the rebuilding in the first quarter of the 17th century. During World War I and II Shapwick House, not the Manor, was used as a convalescent home for injured servicemen. Between 1956 and 1980, Shapwick Manor was a boarding house for boys at Millfield School, and was later home to Shapwick School, which closed definitively in March 2020. Architecture Shapwick Manor is a two-storey stone building that has an asymmetrical frontage with a glazed veranda supported on iron columns to one side of the building. The stable block, which was built in the 17th century, is also Grade II listed. The dovecote is medieval but was restored in the 18th and 19th centuries, with a new roof being installed in the 20th century. The stone screen and flanking walls were built around 1658.

Cumming models occasionally, and has modeled for several well known designers and has appeared in global campaigns for H&M; and Diesel. Cumming is also a political activist and is active in the Model Alliance. She has produced and directed a video featuring her fellow models, encouraging young people to become politically active.  Early life  Cumming was born in Manhattan to Alec Cumming, a television writer/producer, and Cynthia Harden, a physician and epileptologist. (Harden is currently chair of the epilepsy section of the American Academy of Neurology.) In the 1990s, Alec and Cynthia were a creative partnership as well as a marital one - writing, performing, and releasing songs in the alternative pop band Bite The Wax Godhead (1990-1998). Julia grew up in the East Village, Manhattan, attended New York City public schools, and started a band - Supercute! - along with neighborhood friends June Lei and Rachel Trachtenburg (of the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players) in 2009. Supercute!, a bubblegum-girl-group-psychedelic-pop amalgam, created (in Cumming's words) \\"ukelele rock operas\\"; the band lasted through 2013 with Cumming and Trachtenburg serving as their creative core. \\"It was almost an art project about not letting your age or being a girl stop you from trying anything,\\" Julia told the New Musical Express in 2016. Cumming and Trachtenburg also co-hosted a talk show (Pure Imagination, 2011-2013), on the Progressive Radio Network, aimed at encouraging fellow teens to become involved in art and political action. In 2014, Cumming graduated as a vocal music student at Professional Performing Arts School, made her acting debut in the movie short People Who Don't Know Me, and performed solo gigs with original musical material at local clubs, often with her father accompanying her on bass. She also interned at the Museum of Modern Art, where she curated an off-site show about instagram art. There she met choreographer Dean Moss, who cast her for a leading role in his dance piece johnbrown, which debuted at The Kitchen on October 16, 2014.  Sunflower Bean  Nick Kivlen and Julia Cumming performing with Sunflower Bean. In August 2013, Cumming joined guitarist Nick Kivlen and drummer Jacob Faber in Sunflower Bean, a power trio initially based in Glen Head, New York that had started off a spin-off of the band Turnip King. In the following year, the band moved to Bushwick, Brooklyn and became a part of the borough's thriving \\"DIY\\" scene, playing over eighty shows that year and earning themselves title of New York City's \\"hardest- working band of 2014\\". The band's appearance at the 2014 CMJ Music Marathon received good notices from All Songs Considered's Bob Boilen and from The New York Times's Jon Pareles, who wrote \\"New York is still home to bands as varied as Sunflower Bean, whose music suggests what might have happened if psychedelia had emerged after punk and the Police rather than before.\\" The band recorded their debut EP Show Me Your Seven Secrets (initially self- released on January 27, 2015) and was signed to Fat Possum Records later that year. The album Human Ceremony was released on February 5, 2016, garnering largely positive reviews; \\"I Was a Fool\\", the first single released from Sunflower Bean's upcoming second album Twentytwo In Blue, debuted on NPR's \\"Songs We Love\\" series on November 3, 2017. Twentytwo In Blue was released on March 23, 2018 by Mom + Pop Music in the U.S. and Lucky Number Music worldwide. Modeling career Although Cumming had done occasional modeling jobs in the Supercute! era, her fashion career was bolstered in February 2014, when she was asked to walk in Yves Saint Laurent's Ready To Wear Fall Winter 2014 show in Paris. Saint Laurent's creative director Hedi Slimane signed the musician to an exclusive modeling contract, using her in three campaigns and in six shows for Saint Laurent; Cumming was frequently referred to as \\"Hedi Slimane's muse\\" in the press at the time. Since then, she has modeled for Anna Sui, Elsa Schiaparelli, Max Mara, Rochas and Fausto Puglisi, appeared in global campaigns for H&M; and Diesel, and was seen on the cover of Harper's Bazaar Kazakhstan and in many fashion editorials, most notably in many of Vogue's international editions (US, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Japan).

Featuring more than 2,200 objects, it is one of the largest of its kind in the United States. Asmat art is widely collected in major Western museums despite the difficulty in visiting the remote region to collect work; the \\"exceptionally expressive\\" art \\"caused a sensation in art-collecting circles\\" which led to large-scale collecting expeditions in the post-WWII era, according to art scholar and ethnology Dirk A.M. Smidt. The gallery includes a permanent display of Asmat works such as ancestor poles (bis) and canoes, and a rotating exhibition highlighting aspects of Asmat art and culture. Much of the collection is accessible through the museum's online database. The museum was founded by Bishop Alphonse Sowada, a Minnesota native who worked with the Asmat people in Agats, Indonesia, for decades starting in 1958. Sowada, who had earned a master's degree in cultural anthropology from Catholic University of America, wrote books on Asmat art and culture and collected hundreds of artifacts, which later formed the core of the museum's collection. Sowada was also instrumental in founding the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress in Agats in 1973, described by the artist Tobias Schneebaum as \\"a museum designed for the local people, not the nonexistent tourist,\\" as well as an annual woodcarving competition and auction to recognize outstanding carvers in Agats, held in October since 1981. After Sowada's retirement and return to the United States, he housed the collection in Hastings, Nebraska, and Shoreview, Minnesota, before donating it to St. Thomas in 2007. The current museum was opened in 2012.

Early life and education Fahd bin Abdullah was born in Mecca on 3 January 1948. His parents are Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Saud Al Kabir and Seeta bint Abdulaziz Al Saud. Fahd's father, Abdullah, was Mohammed bin Saud Al Kabir's son. Princess Seeta, who died on 2011, was the sister of late King Abdullah. Prince Fahd has five blood siblings: Turki, Bandar, Noura and Nouf. Prince Fahd had received his primary and secondary education at the Capital Institute in Riyadh. After advanced education in English in the United Kingdom, he joined the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF), where he received pilot training followed by tactical training in the U.S. He graduated from the U.S. Air Force Command and Staff College. In 1965 he also completed T33 jet qualification training in Randolph Air Force Base. Career As a squadron commander, he oversaw the introduction of the F-5 fighter into the RSAF. In 1975 he was appointed Director of Operations in HQ RSAF, rising to the rank of Brigadier General in 1982. As Director of Air Operations, he oversaw the introduction of the F-15 fighter, AWACS as well as an extensive command, control and communication system. He thus made a significant contribution towards the modernization of this highly capable air force. Prince Fahd's overall objective was to create a self-sufficient fighting force. To demonstrate this capability, he deployed a RSAF squadron to the U.S. to participate in war games with U.S. Air Force units. The success of this deployment was noted by the U.S. Secretary of Defense and was instrumental in his approval of the AWACS and a modern command and control system, both of which would be under the control Saudi Arabian authority. In 1984, Prince Fahad was appointed as assistant to the minister of defense. His role included regulating the Saudi Meteorological & Environmental Protection Agency (MEPA). He was president of the executive office of the Arab Ministerial Council of MEPA from 1987 to 2003.

Under his leadership, the EOP generated investments in excess of SR 21 Billion and created more than 7,200 jobs with 56% Saudisation. Economic Offset companies accumulated revenues in excess of SR 49 Billion, almost 25% of which was from exports. Prince Fahad was taking his objective of self-sufficiency to the private sector. He structured the program to develop industries which could support both the national defense and private sector commercial requirements. In November 2011, Prince Fahad was appointed to a new position as President of the General Authority for Civil Aviation (GACA) and Chairman of the board of Saudi Arabian Airlines. The GACA is responsible for the running of all national airports and controls civil air traffic within the kingdom. Prince Fahd oversaw the introduction of the modern fleet to the Saudi Arabian Airlines 747-8 cargo, 777, and 787. Having established GACA on a very firm footing, Prince Fahad left the government in 2015. Personal life Prince Fahd has six children, including Saud. He spends his time focusing on a non profit organizations and giving back to the public. He is also a member of the board of trustees at The Princess Seeta bint Abdulaziz Foundation for Social Excellence.
