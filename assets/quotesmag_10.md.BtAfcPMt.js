The dean of the law school responded, \\"Columbia does not admit women to its law school. If you're interested in going to college, apply at Barnard.\\" Despite the admonishment, Wolman later became a distinguished and noted lawyer. In 1920, her family moved again to the Park Circle neighborhood of Baltimore. She briefly enrolled at Goucher College, but withdrew to finish a three-month program at Baltimore Business College and start at the University of Maryland School of Law in 1921.

It offers in-patient and transitional treatment for adults, as well as research facilities. There are 13 outpatient facilities and 11 residential programs in the four surrounding counties. The facility shares space with the co-located Nathan Kline Institute. The inpatient treatment center has 410 beds. The current hospital replaces an older hospital on the same site. Abandoned Rockland State Hospital building in 2015  History  Rockland State Hospital was originally established in 1926 by the State of New York. Dr. Russell Blaisdell was appointed the hospital's first superintendent in July 1930, and its first patients were admitted in January 1931. Blaisdell created a new method of classifying patients, streamlined admissions, and took particular interest in children's care, culminating in the creation of a Children's Group unit and a separate building on campus for that purpose in 1936. Rockland began employing insulin shock therapy in 1937, and later, electroconvulsive therapy. By its peak in 1959 Rockland had more than 9000 residents and a staff of 2000 on a sprawling campus. In 1970, the Children's Group unit closed, its services moved to a new building by a new name, the Rockland Children's Psychiatric Center immediately to the west of the existing original Rockland campus. In the meantime, by the decade of the 1970s the overall inpatient population had been greatly reduced at Rockland by the evolving practice of deinstitutionalization. The hospital's name was changed to Rockland Psychiatric Center in 1974. By 2010, the Rockland Children's Psychiatric Center had closed, and services were moved once again, this time to the Rockland Children's Center, a 56-bed facility also on the sprawling Rockland Campus. In the meantime, the site of the shut down Rockland Children's Psychiatric Center was repurposed as a filming location for the Netflix television series Orange is the New Black. The oldest abandoned buildings on the Rockland campus that are still standing are generally closed to the public. The campus at its largest size once represented one of the largest intact psychiatric hospital facilities in the United States. In 2003, the state of New York transferred sold of the former hospital campus no longer in active use to the Town of Orangetown. In 2017, 60 acres of the land containing abandoned buildings were sold to JPMorgan Chase for the construction of a data center, and significant demolition of most buildings in that parcel was completed in 2018.

Palladius made sure the Bible was translated from Latin to Danish, the language the common people understood. Christian III approved it in 1550 and every church could obtain a copy.

The film predominantly covers the story of American pilot Al Schwimmer and his covert operation to deliver weapons to the Israeli Army prior to and during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. It was first released on PBS to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Synopsis In 1948, months before what was considered an imminent Jewish State and an imminent invasion by neighboring countries such as Jordan and Egypt, the United States publicly announced their refusal to send military aid to Israel out of concern for antagonizing Middle Eastern countries during the Cold War. Al Schwimmer had been a flight engineer of World War II, and he maintained many contacts after the war had ended. He used his World War II experience and contacts to illegally smuggle surplus rifles, machine guns, bullets and fighter planes to Israel. These supplies mainly came from Czechoslovakia, where many of the arms had been used by the Nazis. They arrived in Israel just as British rule ended, and Schwimmer returned to the United States to buy and smuggle out B-17 bombers. His men participated in the ensuing war. They took control of the skies and formed the Israeli Air Force. In 1950, after turning themselves in, Schwimmer and nine of his men were convicted for violating the US Neutrality Acts for smuggling arms into Israel. Although they avoided prison sentences, they were stripped of their civil rights and fined $10,000 each. Schwimmer refused to ask for a pardon, believing that smuggling weapons to help create a Jewish State was the moral decision to make. In 2001 President Bill Clinton pardoned Schwimmer. The film ends listing the fates of many of the pilots who had flown on the mission, the last of which is Schwimmer himself, who died in 2011. Background Boaz Dvir first became fascinated with the project after hearing about his grandfather‚Äôs experiences in Israel following the Holocaust. ‚ÄúHe told me in 1948 when he came to Israel, he was sent to the desert to fight,‚Äù Dvir said. ‚ÄúWhen he got there, he thought he was going to die because his platoon had no weapons. One day they did get rifles. When he looked closely at his rifle, he saw a swastika on it.‚Äù‚ÄòA Wing and a Prayer‚Äô to play at Penn State Great Valley, Daily Local News, October 12, 2015 Neither of them knew where the weapons came from, so Dvir began research he figured would take a few days. The actual process took many years. Dvir conducted lengthy interviews with Schwimmer one year before his death. He also interviewed 29 other veterans, family members and historians. Included was Lou Lenart and Harold Livingston. The interviewees were located predominantly in the United States and Israel, and Dvir made sure that each story was corroborated on by two independent sources for the sake of accuracy. Many of the people he interviewed described their actions as preventing a \\"second Holocaust,\\" something that Dvir had otherwise not considered. \\"I came to understand why they viewed a loss by Israel as a second Holocaust.\\" Dvir said. \\"It would‚Äôve meant the death of tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of people; the destruction of the only entity on Earth willing to take in Holocaust survivors; and the stamping out of the Jews‚Äô 2,000-year aspiration to return to their ancient homeland.\\" He put in seven years researching and producing the film (working on Jessie's Dad and Discovering Gloria simultaneously) on a modest budget of $135,000, half of which came out of pocket.Israeli Air Force, particularly its scrappy beginnings, inspires 3 films, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, May 12, 2015 Additional funds came from private donors. Dvir explained, ‚ÄúOne [donor] led me to another who led me to another.

His work was influenced by ideas and sentiments of the Romantic-Nationalism like other poets of the national Awakening before him. Life Siliqi was born in a simple family in Shkod√´r, today's Albania, back then under the Ottoman rule. His father was a baker. He pursued his first education in the Serbian language school in his town, and later in Ruzdiye (Turkish middle school), where he would immediately spike out for his anti-Ottoman propaganda among the students. At a certain point he got close to being arrested, and his family sent him to Cetinje, Montenegro where three of his brothers had settled before. Siliqi did not stop his nationalist activity for the 10 years that he was in exile. Together with his brothers he opened a small hotel named \\"Albania\\" which served as meeting station for patriotic activities. He also traveled to Romania and Bulgaria to meet with the Albanian communities there. Siliqi was an active arms-in-hand participant of the Albanian Revolt of 1911, and together with his collaborators Hil Mosi and Luigj Gurakuqi member of its leadership structure \\"the Albanian Committee\\" (Alb: Komiteti Shqiptar). He participated in the meeting of G√´r√ße (Gerƒçe, today's Montenegro) and was a signatory of the G√´r√ße Memorandum. Meanwhile, all these events inspired him to write; many of his patriotic poems would appear in newspapers of the Albanian communities. The First Balkan War would find him in Cetinje. After being informed by Austrian intelligence that he was on the list to be arrested together with other Albanian emigre there, he left Cetinje and hid in Kotor. He and others came to Shkod√´r in 1913 via an Austrian ship. The Montenegrin court meanwhile condemned him to death in absentia as \\"enemy of the Montenegrin state\\". Monument in remembrance of G√´r√ße Memorandum in 2011, with Siliqi's name on it The political situation in Shkod√´r was turbulent as well. As home of many communities supported by different European powers' interests, there were sharp contradictions and not enough support for the newly created Albanian state. Risto started working immediately on the unification of stance between Christian and Muslim communities. At that time, there were two main propagandist press-organs in Shkod√´r: Taraboshi of the Arberesh Terenzio Tocci, openly pro-Italian, and Seda-i Millet (Nation's Voice) of Musa Juka, pro-Turkish. At the same time, Essad Pasha Toptani had already established his area of control in central Albania, supported by the participants of the London Conference of 1912‚Äì13, and his propaganda units were also established in Shkod√´r. Siliqi managed to take an open stance against all of these. He was a founding member of the patriotic club \\"Lidhja Shqiptare\\" (Albanian League), and editor-in-chief of the newspaper Shqypnija e Re (New Albania), with Hil Mosi as director and Karlo Suma as treasurer. Beside the patriotic activity, the twice-a-week newspaper gave him the possibility to publish many of his creations which he could not publish as a book due to financial issues. Siliqi resigned from the \\"Lidhja Shqiptare\\" due to his disagreement on calling the Montenegrin side for military help in order to suppress the Essadist and pro-Turkish units in Shkod√´r. He joined the volunteer units that went to aid Prince Wied against the Muslim rebels of Haxhi Qamili. The Montenegrin invasion of Shkod√´r of 1914 during World War I found Siliqi there; he was immediately arrested together with Luigj Gurakuqi. speed trialed, and received a death sentence. The Austri- Hungarian offensive against Montenegro and the capitulation of the later saved his life. On a professional point of view, Siliqi had already started practitioner as a layer. With the end of World War I, he focused his energies on the law field. The endeavors of the new Albanian state left him with a bitter disappointment. He worked as a judge in Vlor√´ in 1921, and in 1923 he became First Secretary of the Ministry of Justice. Nevertheless, in 1924 he resigned and returned to his home town without engaging anymore in politics from 1925. He worked as a lawyer for the rest of his life, precisely until 1 May 1936. Poetry Siliqi completely possessed Albanian language as a language of letters after he got in touch with the work of other National Awakening poets. At the same time he started writing poetry; this was around 1900. Though his language was heavy in dialect as well as Slavic or Turkish borrowings, his poetry shows a talent in progress. Even after 1915, when his lexicology and phraseology obtained a clear Albanian language shape, his orthography remained the same. As a metric, his first works are clearly based on the Albanian folkloric octosyllable verse style. He mostly used trochaic verses with a very few iambic. He also used 6,7,10,12,16 syllable verses, where 6 and 7 mostly in the iambs, and 6,8,10 dominate the trochees, sometimes even mixed metrics. Siliqi finished his high school studies while in Cetinje. There he got in touch with classics as Homer, Tolstoy, and Lermontov. His first poetry was of personal nature, sometimes with notes of humor or social grief. Such were Dlirsija (Purity), Grave pa evlad (To women without children), K√´nga e pijes (Booze song), N√´ vetmi (In solitude), etc, which show him as a disturbed romantic soul trying to live in peace only with its inner world. But the main themes for Siliqi were the patriotic ones. Filled with optimism and rage against any kind of oppression, Siliqi is clearly the poet who call for action and criticisms stagnancy and passivity. His message was clear \\"S'kemi c'presim nga Evropa\\" (we can't expect anything from Europe). The only collection of poetry Siliqi managed to publish while alive was Pasqyra e dit√´ve t√´ p√´rgjakshme (Reflection of the bloody days) published in Trieste in 1913, in 176 pages, highly influenced by his experiences of the 1910-1911 revolts. Other poetry's of his were collected from journals of the time. Similar to Asdreni, Siliqi gives social nuances to his poetry in addition to patriotic ones. His \\"hero\\" is the idealist peasant, who leaves all behind and goes to fight for his own country.Letersia - Risto Siliqi (in Albanian) During 1912-1915 he wrote many poems, in around 4,000 verses. After World War II, there was a direct interest in collecting and publishing his work since 1945. The first collection of his selected poetry, both previously published or unpublished, came in 1956, one year after direct guidelines from the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania demanding the figure of Siliqi to be studies and brought to light. It was named Risto Siliqi - Vepra te zgjedhura (Risto Siliqi - Selected works) with Dhimit√´r Fullani as editor, published by the Institute of History ( as part of the back then Institute of Sciences).WorldCat - Vepra t√´ zgjedhura Unlike other Rilindas he was not annihilated by the Communist regime. Trivia Siliqi's love for poetry were passed to his son Llazar Siliqi, and nephew Drago Siliqi, both affirmed names in Albanian literature. A street in Shkod√´r is named after him.

It is regarded as a collaborative approach to qualitative research that promotes the inclusion of the participant in the method of data collection (Burdick, M., 2011). Qualitative researchers are beginning to recognize the value of using transcription poetry as a way of giving more \\"voice\\" to the research participants‚Äô experiences (Bhattacharya, K., 2013). Its value is by creating a \\"snapshot\\" of the original interview text using an art centred approach that makes for a more emotional impact statement to the reader. In her article, Burdick (2011) states, \\"These poems not only reveal critical insights and perspectives of our 2 participants, they also aim to convey intrinsic details of feelings, critical experiences, and/or epiphanies in their lived experiences.\\" History In the early 1990s, sociologist, Laurel Richardson started incorporating poetry into the research method as a way of bringing more participant voice into the qualitative research method. Richardson took notice that the poetic method was not warmly embraced by the scientific community as it did not follow the already established norms and practices of research methodology. However, Richardson saw that a change was occurring, \\"as these researchers begin to examine issues of culture, power, and authority in new ways (2011). In her article, Burdick (2011) wrote, \\"poetry offers something \\"profoundly different\\" to the world of educational research. When using poetry, researchers must be willing to trust the process more than finding the right answer. Poetry is meant to focus on different questions and contribute a new narrative to how knowledge is perceived and created.\\" Method Transcript poetry is found between fieldnotes/texts and the final research report. Researchers work through the transcript texts and code them for themes, thereby condensing larger transcripts to poems that act as a synopsis for part of or the whole transcript. The researcher collaborates with the participant ensuring the message of the original transcript is intact (Ratkoviƒá, S., 2014). See also *Narrative inquiry References * Balan, N. B. (2005).

Cole is a case decided by the Arkansas Supreme Court concerning the adoption rights of unmarried couples. On April 7, 2011, the Arkansas Supreme Court unanimously struck down Arkansas Act 1, passed by voters two and a half years earlier. Background On November 4, 2008, Arkansas voters passed \\"Act 1\\" prohibiting unmarried couples from jointly adopting. The law disproportionately targeted gay couples, as they could not marry in the state at the time. On December 30, 2008, plaintiffs Sheila Cole amongst others filed a lawsuit in Pulaski County Circuit Court against the Arkansas Department of Human Services and others seeking to declare the statute unconstitutional. The plaintiffs contended that the act violated Articles 2, Section 2 and Section 15 of the Arkansas Constitution as well as the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Circuit Court Opinion and Appeal On April 16, 2010, Judge Chris Piazza of Pulaski County Circuit Court struck down Act 1, ruling that it violated the Arkansas state constitutions' guarantee of right to privacy. Piazza cited Jegley v. Picado, a case decided by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 2002, which struck down the state's law prohibiting unmarried couples from sexual intercourse based on the right to privacy. On May 16, the judge entered the final order striking down Act 1, but stayed his ruling pending appeal. Arkansas Supreme Court On April 7, 2011, the Arkansas Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the lower court's ruling. The court determined that the fundamental right to privacy was being infringed upon, and thus the court applied heightened scrutiny in finding Act 1 unconstitutional. Justice Robert L. Brown wrote the majority opinion, concluding that under the act, ‚Äúthe exercise of one‚Äôs fundamental right to engage in private, consensual sexual activity is conditioned on foregoing the privilege of adopting or fostering children. The choice imposed on cohabiting sexual partners, whether heterosexual or homosexual, is dramatic. They must choose either to lead a life of private, sexual intimacy with a partner without the opportunity to adopt or foster children or forego sexual cohabitation and, thereby, attain eligibility to adopt of foster.‚Äù The court, like the court below it, relied upon Jegley v. Picado in finding a fundamental right to privacy, which Act 1 infringed upon by forcing unmarried adults to choose between adopting children, and their fundamental right to privacy. The ruling had the effect of same-sex couples being able to adopt in Arkansas for the first time. Prior to the act, same-sex couples were not permitted to jointly adopt as state law did not allow for it. Thus, the ruling made Arkansas one of the first few states to recognize adoptions by same-sex couples. Almost four years exactly after Judge Piazza struck down Arkansas' ban on adoption, he struck down the state's prohibition on same-sex marriage as well. His ruling was not affirmed by the state Supreme Court before the Supreme Court of the United States ruled Ohio's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional.

This concept arose from the necessity to work with a bunch of groups satisfying certain special property (for example finiteness or commutativity). Since set theory does not admit the \\"set of all groups\\", it is necessary to work with the more general concept of class.  Definition  A class of groups \\\\mathfrak{X}~ is a collection of groups such that if G\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{X}~ and G\\\\cong H~ then H\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{X}~. Groups in the class \\\\mathfrak{X}~ are referred to as \\\\mathfrak{X}-groups. For a set of groups \\\\mathfrak{I}~, we denote by (\\\\mathfrak{I}) the smallest class of groups containing \\\\mathfrak{I}. In particular for a group G, (G) denotes its isomorphism class.  Examples  The most common examples of classes of groups are: * \\\\emptyset: the empty class of groups * \\\\mathfrak{C}: the class of cyclic groups. * \\\\mathfrak{A}~: the class of abelian groups. * \\\\mathfrak{U}~: the class of finite supersolvable groups * \\\\mathfrak{N}~: the class of nilpotent groups * \\\\mathfrak{S}~: the class of finite solvable groups * \\\\mathfrak{I}~: the class of finite simple groups * \\\\mathfrak{E}~: the class of finite groups * \\\\mathfrak{G}~: the class of all groups  Product of classes of groups Given two classes of groups \\\\mathfrak{X}~ and \\\\mathfrak{Y}~ it is defined the product of classes \\\\mathfrak{X}\\\\mathfrak{Y}~=(GG \\\\text{ has a normal subgroup } N\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{X} \\\\text{ with } G/N\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{Y}) This construction allows us to recursively define the power of a class by setting \\\\mathfrak{X}^0=(1) and \\\\mathfrak{X}^n=\\\\mathfrak{X}^{n-1}\\\\mathfrak{X} It must be remarked that this binary operation on the class of classes of groups is neither associative nor commutative. For instance, consider the alternating group of degree 4 (and order 12); this group belongs to the class (\\\\mathfrak{C}\\\\mathfrak{C})\\\\mathfrak{C} because it has as a subgroup the group V_4 which belongs to \\\\mathfrak{C}\\\\mathfrak{C} and furthermore A_4/V_4\\\\cong C_3 which is in \\\\mathfrak{C}. However A_4 has no non-trivial normal cyclic subgroup, so A_4 ot\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{C}(\\\\mathfrak{C}\\\\mathfrak{C}). Then \\\\mathfrak{C}(\\\\mathfrak{C}\\\\mathfrak{C}) ot=(\\\\mathfrak{C}\\\\mathfrak{C})\\\\mathfrak{C}. However it is straightforward from the definition that for any three classes of groups \\\\mathfrak{X}, \\\\mathfrak{Y}, and \\\\mathfrak{Z}, \\\\mathfrak{X}(\\\\mathfrak{Y}\\\\mathfrak{Z})\\\\subseteq(\\\\mathfrak{X}\\\\mathfrak{Y})\\\\mathfrak{Z}  Class maps and closure operations A class map c is a map which assigns a class of groups \\\\mathfrak{X} to another class of groups c\\\\mathfrak{X}. A class map is said to be a closure operation if it satisfies the next properties: # c is expansive: \\\\mathfrak{X}\\\\subseteq c\\\\mathfrak{X} # c is idempotent: c\\\\mathfrak{X}=c(c\\\\mathfrak{X}) # c is monotonic: If \\\\mathfrak{X}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathfrak{Y} then c\\\\mathfrak{X}\\\\subseteq c\\\\mathfrak{Y} Some of the most common examples of closure operations are: * S\\\\mathfrak{X}=(GG\\\\leq H, \\\\ H\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{X}) * Q\\\\mathfrak{X}=(G\\\\text{exists }H\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{X} \\\\text{ and an epimorphism from }H \\\\text{ to }G) * N_0\\\\mathfrak{X}=(G \\\\text{ exists }K_i\\\\ (i=1,\\\\cdots,r)\\\\text{ subnormal in }G\\\\text{ with }K_i\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{X}\\\\text{ and }G=\\\\langle K_1,\\\\cdots,K_r\\\\rangle) * R_0\\\\mathfrak{X}=(G \\\\text{ exists }N_i\\\\ (i=1,\\\\cdots,r)\\\\text{ normal in }G\\\\text{ with }G/N_i\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{X}\\\\text{ and }\\\\bigcap\\\\limits_{i=1}^rNi=1) * S_n\\\\mathfrak{X}=(GG\\\\text{ is subnormal in }H\\\\text{ for some }H\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{X}) References * * See also Formation Category:Properties of groups Category:Group theory Category:Algebraic structures ","title":"Class of groups"},{"id":"48438173","text":"Heavy Gear is a 1997 computer game made for the Windows 95 operating system, based on the Heavy Gear role-playing game. A sequel, Heavy Gear II, was released in 1999. Plot The story follows the crew of the CNCS landship Vigilance (an enormous hovercraft carrier) as they played a cat-and-mouse game across the badlands with a rival landship from the AST, the Draco. Development Faced with the loss of the BattleTech-MechWarrior property, Activision acquired exclusive worldwide rights to video games based on the Heavy Gear series. Heavy Gear was developed by largely the same team which created Mechwarrior 2, though with the significant addition of Frank Evers, then best known for Earthsiege 2. The game used an enhanced version of the Mechwarrior 2 game engine, and was partly derived from existing MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries code. Before the release of the PC game, an arcade version based on the Virtuality Hardware Platforms was developed but never released. Reception In Computer Gaming World, Greg Fortune wrote, \\"The most disappointing thing about this game is that you see lots of parts of the game that really do show care and creativity.\\" He considered Heavy Gear a missed opportunity that failed to live up to its competitor, the MechWarrior franchise. Fortune concluded, \\"As it stands, the game feels more like a beta than a finished product and is woefully incomplete in many areas.\\" Alex C of Computer & Video Games dismissed the game as \\"yet another tweak to the aging MechWarrior 2 engine.\\" Writing for Computer Games Strategy Plus, Tom Chick summarized, \\"It's not a total loss, but what's good about Heavy Gear is the stuff that was good about the MechWarrior games all along. But what's bad about Heavy Gear is inexcusable coming from a veteran team of game designers.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"In creating Heavy Gear, Activision has a different universe and a better engine but a roughly designed game. Mechwarrior 2 still holds the edge with flamboyant mech designs and a sweeping storyline.\\" The reviewer from Pyramid #30 (March/April, 1998) stated that \\"A lot of hype heralded the Heavy Gear Computer Game. For months prior to its release, gaming magazines touted it as a 'Mechkiller' and the game to 'make Mechwarrior fans forget Battletech.' Briefly, it's not and it won't.\\" References External links *Heavy Gear at MobyGames Category:1997 video games Category:Activision games Category:Heavy Gear video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Video games about mecha Category:Video games based on tabletop role-playing games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Heavy Gear (video game)"},{"id":"48438174","text":"Heavy Gear II is a mecha based first-person shooter video game. Set in Dream Pod 9's Heavy Gear universe, the game was developed and published by Activision in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, it was ported to Linux in 2000 by Loki Software. It is a sequel to the 1997 video game Heavy Gear. Plot An atrocity caused by the New Earth Concordat (NEC) ‚Äî the destruction of the Badlands city of Peace River by an antimatter bomb ‚Äî leads to a formal cease- fire between the Northern and Southern Leagues. A team of elite Special-Ops pilots from across the planet, equipped with advanced prototype Gears and a newly unveiled intersystem assault shuttle, are sent through the interstellar Tannhauser gate to the planet Caprice, the nearest NEC base, to find out more and strike back at the enemy. Gameplay Heavy Gear II incorporates third- person and stealth elements. Development Development of Heavy Gear II began during the autumn of 1997 with an aggressive 13 month schedule which aimed to ship the game in autumn 1998. The Heavy Gear II team was a newly formed group within Activision, composed of some of the best and brightest employees that the firm had available, each of whom had experience working on several 3D games previously. The design team wanted to move away from the larger BattleMech style gears as found in the original Heavy Gear, and to smaller, more agile gears, staying truer the Heavy Gear universe and allowing for faster paced and more diverse gameplay. Work began on a new game engine, named Dark Side, to power the title. Built in C++, the first priority for the engine was stability, with a focus on memory management and leak tracking, allowing developers to spot memory leaks as soon as they occurred, rather than later on in a test cycle. By adopting a modular approach to their engine design, developers could easily switch in and out different systems as they experimented during the development process. Although there were debates within the team regarding the issue, it was concluded that software rendering was insufficient to deliver on the teams' visual goals, and so support was dropped from the engine, making video cards a necessity to run Heavy Gear II. This allowed the team to focus on delivering a single high quality product, saving the team from having to replicate in-game assets at lower level of details for lower specification machines, cutting time in production and testing. By targeting only video card equipped machines, Heavy Gear II could feature more units on screen and greater environmental detail. Offloading the visual rendering to dedicated video cards allowed for CPU cycles to be freed up for other uses such as AI systems. The approach to AI was to go for a high level \\"autopilot\\" system, whereby non-player characters could decide for themselves what objectives to achieve and how to go about it. This reduced the need for individually scripted actions, and enforced a consistent feel across all missions. Enemy units have a tactical awareness on the battlefield, and will keep track of the successes and failures of different approaches against the player character, varying their tactics depending on the situation. Enemy units may split off into separate fireteams, call upon reinforcements or order artillery strikes against the player. Multiplayer was an important element in the game, and it was implemented using an internal Activision networking SDK early in development, before even the single-player portion of the game. Although co-operative multiplayer was also planned, this feature had to be dropped, as it proved impossible to populate the game with enough enemy units to make the game challenging. The missions designed for the planned co-op mode were however, saved for the standalone single-player \\"Historic Missions\\" in the final game. Despite the experience of the team, Heavy Gear II did not adhere to the intended schedule. The team underestimated the work needed to produce a demo, and did not factor in costs involved with employee turnover into their original schedule. When the game was released in June 1999, it had missed the intended ship date by approximately nine months. This slippage also had a negative impact on the effectiveness of the marketing campaign. The Dark Side engine would be used again in Activision's Interstate '82, released later that year. In October 1999, it was announced that Loki Software would be porting Heavy Gear II across to Linux. The Linux port took Loki Software approximately 6 months to complete, and was described by Loki as \\"their most challenging product to date\\". As Heavy Gear II uses Microsoft's proprietary Direct3D API for graphical rendering, Loki had to port this to OpenGL in order for it to run on Linux. To realise the game's 3D sound on Linux, Loki worked with support from Creative Technology to build an open standard audio API from scratch with a cross-platform free software implementation, named OpenAL. Heavy Gear II was the first Direct3D game to be ported to OpenGL, and was the first to implement OpenAL. The Linux port was released in April 2000, and a demo followed in June. Reception Heavy Gear II was commercially unsuccessful. In the United States, it sold 15,000 units by the end of July 1999, according to PC Data. Mark Asher of CNET Gamecenter called these figures \\"pretty awful\\" and remarked that it \\"has to be a major disappointment for Activision.\\" The game's sales in the United States rose to 28,598 copies by the end of 1999. Daily Radar's Andrew S. Bub named it the most unfairly overlooked simulation title of the year. Critical reception towards the game was generally positive, receiving a rating of 81% on review aggregation website GameRankings. The game was compared favourably to its predecessor, Heavy Gear, with PCZone stating that it was a huge improvement over the first game, and GameSpot believing that Activision had redeemed itself for the failures of the original. Critics praised the gameplay. Next Generation described the game as \\"a big, splendid mech sim, with lots of depth and excellent balance between action and strategy\\". PC Zone echoed similar sentiments, calling it \\"a commendable stab at creating a balanced blend of strategy and all-out bot-blasting action\\". IGN highlighted the diversity on offer, stating that the \\"variety in environments, variety in Gear loadout and variety in gameplay\\" was above and beyond that offered by others in the genre. The Dark Side powered graphics were well received. GameSpot described the graphics as being \\"very impressive, with detailed, heavily articulated gears and vehicles, natural-looking fauna [and] vivid landscapes.\\" Maximum PC described the engine as \\"gorgeous\\", praising it for providing \\"sharply rendered mechs and terrain details, as well as eye-popping explosions that light up the landscape\\" and other graphical effects. It did note however, that there were \\"a few clipping and polygon-collision-detection glitches\\", similar detractions were noted by Linux Journal and IGN. Performance wise, PC Gamer found it ran surprisingly well, even below the minimum requirements, while Maximum PC noted that the game maintained a consistent 30 fps on their test machine. IGN warned however, that they encountered several crash bugs on the instant action and historical mission modes. Critics enjoyed the Gear customisation options. IGN, Next Generation and Linux Journal all highlighted the sheer number of options available. Although GameSpot felt that the \\"threat level\\" limitation was artificial, it praised the flexibility it offered. PC Zone stated it was \\"a joy to give birth to these new creations and see them succeed in the task they were created for\\", in regards to the Gear customisation process. Response to the AI was mixed. GameSpot praised the AI as challenging, and PC Zone described the enemy AI as being \\"clued-up on battle tactics\\", able to \\"dodge and weave all over the place\\" as well as seek reinforcements. PC Gamer disagreed, accusing the AI of being \\"absolutely, hilariously terrible\\", a view shared with Linux Journal, who described the AI as being \\"basically pathetic\\", both critics cited examples of poor pathfinding. Critics reacted favourably to the multiplayer options. PC Zone described it as being \\"well-conceived and well-supported\\", highlighting the various modes of multiplayer gameplay and the \\"thriving clan structure\\". While IGN felt that there was nothing particularly new or innovative in the multiplayer game, and Maximum PC felt that it was not as strong as the single player experience, both critics still felt the multiplayer experience to be worthwhile. GameSpot compared the multiplayer element favourably to that of rival mecha game, MechWarrior 3, but like Linux Journal, found the lack of co- operative multiplayer a disappointment. Some critics pointed out difficulty in adapting to the controls. PC Zone found the controls frustrating, warning readers about the \\"virtually insurmountable learning curves\\". The control system was described as the most notable flaw in the game by IGN, with the critic having to resort to using a printed controls reference card included with the game. Linux Journal looked at it from the other direction though, pointing out that once mastered, \\"the payoff, however, is extraordinary; the level of control a player has in HG2 is amazing.\\" Although a sequel was reported to be in production at Savage Entertainment, this was ultimately cancelled. Activision would discontinue development on the Heavy Gear franchise in 2002, believing that strictly PC games such as Heavy Gear II did not have a viable future with the launch and growth of sixth generation consoles. No further news of Heavy Gear video games appeared until 2012, when Dream Pod 9 announced that Stompy Bot Productions were to produce a new game. In 2013, Stompy Bot launched a crowdfunding campaign, aiming to raise $900,000 towards the development of Heavy Gear Assault. Though the Kickstarter element of the campaign failed, development of the game is still ongoing.

It premiered on November 3, 2015 on Fox, after a week hiatus due to the 2015 World Series. The episode was directed by Barbara Brown and written by Ryan Murphy. The episode centers around the Chanels' effort to contact the deceased Chanel #2 (Ariana Grande) using a Ouija board to dig information about the killer, and Dean Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) dealing with facing her ex-husband (Philip Casnoff) and his young mistress (Tavi Gevinson). This episode was watched live by 2.44 million viewers and received negative reviews from critics. Plot In the Kappa House, Chanel (Emma Roberts) organizes a funeral for Chanel #2 (Ariana Grande), as her parents ironically go on a cruise to celebrate their daughter's confirmed death. Chanel gives a scathing eulogy, calling her multiple curse words as she felt that Chanel #2 never had her back and that she slept with Chad (Glen Powell) (Even though all Chanels did the same behind Chanel's back). Concerned for their leader, Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd), Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin), and Hester/Chanel #6 (Lea Michele) bring a Ouija Board for them all to contact #2 from beyond the grave. Thinking that was ridiculous at first, Chanel decides to go along with it. Chanel #2 answers various questions via the Ouija Board, up until she tells them that Chad is cheating on Chanel, which angers Chanel. Chanel wants to prove her wrong. Chanel walks into the Dickie's house, calling for Chad until she walks into his room and catches him shirtless with a goat on his bed. At first, she thinks that he was having sex with the goat, but Chad then explains that he's lactose intolerant and his reason for having the goat is that goat's milk is lactose free. Chanel apologizes, realizing that Chanel #2 was lying, as Chad says that she's just angry because she's dead. After the Ouija Board tells Chanel and her minions that Chanel is the killer, her minions find out and start to devise a plot to kill Chanel. While Chanel is asleep, Chanel #2's ghost comes to her room and tells Chanel that she has been sent to Hell and tells her about her awful experiences there. In order for her to make it into Heaven, she must make things right with Chanel, so she apologizes to her for her mistakes and also for sleeping with Chad. Chanel asks her why she said that she's the killer, and she answers that she's just in a bad mood because Adolf Hitler was motor boating her breasts. Before she leaves, she warns Chanel that her minions are plotting to kill her. This provokes Chanel to confront her minions and instead, persuade them to believe that Grace (Skyler Samuels) and Zayday (Keke Palmer) are the killers. Gigi (Nasim Pedrad) brings up whether Grace and Pete (Diego Boneta) have considered investigating Feather McCarthy (Tavi Gevinson), as she claims she had a feud with Dean Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) during her time in Wallace University, and says that Munsch is most likely guilty for the crimes on campus. Meanwhile, Feather reveals that she had an ongoing affair with her Beatles 101 professor, Steven Munsch (Philip Casnoff), the ex-husband of Cathy Munsch. After Steven announced that he wanted a divorce with Cathy, she went ballistic, forcing Steven to temporarily move into the Kappa House. Everywhere Feather went, Cathy would be there, dressed exactly like her, until one day she got Feather kicked out of Kappa, forcing Feather to finish her education online. Soon after, Steven managed to get his house back after the divorce, asking Feather to move in with him. Except one day when she took a bath with her transistor radio, it is revealed that Dean Munsch may have attempted to murder her by pushing the radio into the bathtub, seemingly attempting to murder her the same way a previous Dean died. Pete asks Feather whether she would be able to go on record as a source, to which she willingly agrees. Later that night, Feather returns home only to discover Steven's severed head in a fish tank. Dean Munsch is seen being placed under arrest by Detective Chisolm, as he says he has evidence leading to her murdering Steven. Grace Gardner and Pete Mart√≠nez investigate and manage to link Cathy Munsch to many of the other murders that happened on campus, and so, Cathy is suspected to be the Red Devil and is taken to an insane asylum. Grace and Pete share a kiss, thinking the whole Red Devil case is over, and Cathy Munsch sends Grace a text, asking her and Pete to come and visit her. The following day, they visit her in the asylum, where she reveals she can't eat bologna because it would put her into an anaphylactic shock. It occurs to Pete that the killer made a sandwich at the scene and had taken a bite out of it and they decide to find out what kind it was. Pete and Grace return to the scene to find out that it was a bologna sandwich, and thus, decide Cathy couldn't have been the killer. Feather was incarcerated in solitary confinement, deemed insane for killing Steven. Eventually, Cathy is released from the asylum and reclaims her position as dean of the university. An ending sequence shows Cathy dancing to the song \\"Beware of Young Girls\\" and her narration reveals that she had in fact killed her ex-husband and she made the bologna sandwich as a cover-up so that Feather would get framed. She figured that since the Red Devil was on the loose murdering people, it would be the ideal time to kill Steven. Then we see Feather in the mental asylum where she is locked in a room, completely distraught. We go back to the sorority, where we see the Chanels observing Grace and Zayday Production Ariana Grande returns as a special guest star, portraying Sonya Herfmann / Chanel #2, the deceased member of the Chanels and Kappa Kappa Tau. Many fans and viewers express disappointment regarding her death in the Series Premiere, and in response, Ryan Murphy tweeted about her return in later episodes. On August 4, 2015, it was announced that Tavi Gevinson would be joining the cast as Feather, the mistress of Jamie Lee Curtis's character's ex-husband. Philip Casnoff was cast as Cathy's ex-husband on August 9, 2015.

It first aired on November 10, 2015 on Fox. The episode was directed by Michael Uppendahl and written by Ian Brennan. In this episode, Grace (Skyler Samuels) is getting more determined to find out about the bathtub baby identity, believing it to be her, just as the shocking truth is revealed. Dean Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) goes psycho after the Red Devils attacked her, and Denise (Niecy Nash) becomes the new house mother for Kappa Kappa Tau. The episode's title is a reference to the film of the same name, released in 1981. The episode was watched by 2.51 million viewers and received positive reviews from critics. Plot Grace (Skyler Samuels) and Cathy Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) discuss about the baby in the bathtub incident. Despite making a promise to Grace and Pete to reveal the events of what happened that night in 1995 in exchange for pursuing Feather, Cathy claims she has no memory of ever saying that. She says she was probably high on Klonopin, and so she can't be held accountable for anything she may have said during that time. Cathy also says that because Feather is the killer, the murders have nothing to do with what happened at Kappa 20 years ago, and since Feather has been caught, there's nothing to worry about. Grace is angry that Munsch will not offer up any information, especially since it would greatly help solve who the murderer really is. She tells Cathy that she knows for a fact that Cathy is going to ignore everything that's going on at Wallace University until it personally sneaks up behind her and stabs her in the heart. She then storms out of Cathy's office. That was proven when Cathy is attacked by two Red devils and one more killer dressed as Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia when she was about to take a shower (a remake to the infamous shower scene from the movie Psycho, where Curtis' mother, Janet Leigh stars in the same scene). She fights the 3 of them, and, unable to defeat the Dean, the killers flee. Since Cathy personally got attacked by the killers, she is now willing to give some information to Grace, just as Grace had predicted. Cathy tells Grace that she hypothetically would be an accessory to homicide if she did in fact witness the death at Kappa in 1995 and proceeded to cover it up. She says that even if she did think the murders were linked to what happened 20 years ago, she couldn't start offering up information to the authorities because she would risk implicating herself. She also says that she thought someone would just shoot the killer and it would all be over with, but now, since they are coming after her, and Wallace University would not survive without her, something needs to be done. She then hands Grace a file that contains the name of the girl who died in the tub. Grace then looks at the name of the bathtub baby's mother - Sophia Doyle (McKaley Miller). She immediately gets confused because she was convinced that she was the bathtub baby, but her mom's last name was Mulligan, according to her dad. Dean Munsch tells Grace that she acts like she's a hero who's trying to solve the murders and bring justice to the campus, but really it's just about her finding out who her mother is. Grace gets angry and says she wants to solve the murders, but she also wants to know if she's the reason why they're happening. Cathy then says to Grace she might have something for her but she's gonna get filthy doing it, and Grace storms out the office. Back at Kappa house, The Chanels gather evidence they discovered that prove Zayday (Keke Palmer) and Grace are the killers. Hester (Lea Michele) says she found out that Zayday and Grace are on the pill, with synced cycles, just like their thirst for murder. She says that \\"those who pill together, kill together\\" and Chanel gets annoyed because that's not even a saying. Next, Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin) says she knows for a fact that Zayday is the murderer and plans on killing again because the anagram of Zayday Williams is \\"I MAY SLAY LIZ DAW\\". She says she has no clue who Liz Daw is, but clearly Zayday is contemplating slaying her. Chanel goes mad since the clues are ridiculous and pays two British detectives to do the job. Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd) discovers that Denise (Niecy Nash) has moved into Kappa House and offers her money to prove that Zayday is the killer. Later, Denise and Jennifer \\"The Candle Vlogger\\" (Breezy Eslin) talk about Zayday but get overheard by Zayday, who is mad and warns them to stay away from her. Jennifer is later murdered by the Red Devil when she's hosting her web show. The Chanels and Denise find her body is posed in the dinner table covered in melted wax and surrounded by candles. Jennifer's murder leads Cathy to close the university indefinitely, and a candle light vigil is held for Jennifer. Grace and Pete (Diego Boneta) discover from the painter in the asylum that Gigi (Nasim Pedrad) is The Hag of Shady Lane and that the Hag took care of two babies, and Grace goes to confront her, only to be shut down. In Kappa House, Chanel asks the two detectives about Zayday and Grace, but instead they find something suspicious on her housemate, Libby Putney. Chanel has no idea who that is, and they tell her she might know Libby as Chanel #5. Chanel states she only wants them to prove that Zayday and Grace are the killers. Then, Grace realizes that Gigi must have known her mom from the bathtub incident, which means Wes must have known Gigi. Grace assumes her dad might have something to do with the murders, so she tells him to stay away from her as she runs out of the house. Grace heads back to Kappa, where Chanel is waiting for her in the living room. She presents Grace with a folder containing her mother's criminal records. It turned out the Grace's mother was Bethany Stevens (Anna Grace Barlow), the ruthless Kappa president in 1995 who refused to help Sophia. She hooked up with Wes and married him before having Grace nine months later. The birth of her daughter caused Bethany to change her name to Mary Mulligan and later was arrested for multiple criminal charges. Wes then sued for custody and won. Mary then died a month later in a fiery car crash while intoxicated. The news causes Grace to slap Chanel and storm out. Wes later confirms it to her. Meanwhile, Chanel is forced to apologize to Grace by Denise, being threatened that if she doesn't apologize, she will steal Chad (Glen Powell) away from her. Chanel later apologizes to Grace, and the two make amends. The episode ends with the return of Boone (Nick Jonas) at the gym, who wears a fake beard and disguises as Joaquin Phoenix. He is on the phone with the Red Devil and states that Gigi is the only thing standing in their way and he plans to get rid of her. Production For this episode, Jamie Lee Curtis recreated the infamous shower scene featuring her mother, Janet Leigh from the 1960 film Psycho. Special guest stars returning in this episode include Nick Jonas as Boone Clemens, who faked his death and has been absent since the end of the second episode, Hell Week, and Niecy Nash as Denise Hemphill, the kick-butt but strange security guard. The other recurring characters are Jennifer \\"Candle Vlogger\\" (Breezy Eslin), Bethany Stevens (Anna Grace Barlow), who is revealed to be Grace Gardner's mother who changed her name to Mary Mulligan after the events of 1995 flashback incident, Dan Hildebrand as Detective Baxter, and Daniel Donahue as Detective Chiselhurst, the latter two are the British detectives hired by Chanel to prove Zayday and Grace are the killers.

It first aired on November 17, 2015 on Fox. The episode was directed by Michael Uppendahl and written by Ryan Murphy. The episode focuses on Denise (Niecy Nash)'s attempt to calm The Chanels down by telling them ghost stories and urban legends, which start to become true. The episode also features the return of special guest star Nick Jonas as Boone Clemens, whose activities while being absent are revealed in this episode. The episode was viewed by 2.37 million viewers during its premiere and received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot As Boone Clemens (Nick Jonas) continues his disguise as Joaquin Phoenix as he calls an unknown person over the phone, his fake beard falls off, just as he runs into Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd). He realizes that he's been caught and as soon as he starts to confess, she mistakes him for a ghost. Confused, Boone decides to play along with it and tells her he is the ghost, scaring her away. When she goes back to Kappa House and informs the other Chanels of her encounter with Boone, Denise (Niecy Nash) tells them a couple of ghost stories, stating that they'll be so scared of the cautionary tales that their minds off of the Red Devil and Boone's ghost. The stories only make the Chanels more frightened, with a lore about killers that drag people in the toilet while they're using it, or killers that murder you based on your decision of toilet paper. Later, Boone pays a visit to Chad (Glen Powell), who also thinks he's a ghost. He asks Chad if he can borrow a 'date shirt' of his, saying that the only way for him to be 'among the living' would be to have sex with Zayday (Keke Palmer), much to Chad's confusion at first, knowing Boone is gay, but later complies. Denise is then seen about to use the bathroom, sitting down only to find a choice of blue and red toilet paper. Suddenly, the Red Devil pounces from above, attempting to give her a swirly. She barely escapes, rushing over to the rest of the girls, saying that she needs a ghost story to calm her down. Hester (Lea Michele) begins a story about a meathook killer that runs away and is never found. The legend is that a girl driving a car and got honked by a truck behind her who tried to warn her about a meathook killer in the back seat of her car. Nobody seems to have enjoyed the tale. Denise, feeling much more refreshed, unlocks the doors. Later, Hester told everyone that she is pregnant with Chad's baby. An outraged Chanel goes to confront her boyfriend, who doesn't deny it. She threatens to kill him. Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin) has had enough of being hunted down by the Red Devil, stating that she's leaving and driving home. Sitting in her car, on the radio there is an announcement that warns all passersby of Wallace University to be on the lookout for serial killer, Boone Clemens. The radio then reverts to a calming song, but she is then suddenly interrupted by the honking of a truck driver behind her. She begins to speed up, as we see the Red Devil in her car being honked by the truck driver every time he pops up. She then pulls up in a gas station alongside the truck driver, kicking him in the groin. The truck driver says he was only trying to protect her. As he's explaining this to her, the Red Devil sneaks up behind him and fatally stabs him with a machete. Libby escapes and drives back to campus. Zayday and Earl Grey (Lucien Laviscount) are passionately kissing on Zayday's bed until Earl stops them, saying that he wants everything to be perfect, running quickly to get his 'equipment', implying they want to have sex. Boone climbs through her bedroom window, trying to seduce Zayday, still pretending to be his ghost. Zayday does not buy into it at all and realizes Boone is one of the Red Devil. Grace walks in and realizes everything that's going on. They try to drag him away so they can turn him in, but he shoves them away and falls out the window. But when they look out the window, he has disappeared. Before he can make it back to Zayday's room, Earl is fatally stabbed by the Red Devil. Before Earl dies, the Red Devil removes his mask, revealing him as Boone. Arriving back at the Kappa House, Libby returns with news that the Red Devil attacked her, but Chanel (Emma Roberts) says that this was just mirroring the tale that Hester had told them before about the meathook killer. Libby still continually rants about how nobody is consoling her, as Zayday still grieves the death of her boyfriend Earl. Boone is at Gigi's (Nasim Pedrad) house, telling her that he'd had enough following her instructions. He did everything; including pretending to be gay, to follow her schemes. He is intent on murdering her with the help of the other Red Devil, only to be turned on by the other Red Devil, who fatally stabs him in the chest. Back at the Kappa House, The Chanels try to prove that Hester isn't actually pregnant, which succeeds. But Hester says that she will still have Chad get her pregnant. Angered, Chanel pushes Hester down the stairs, presumably breaking her neck and the Chanels stare at her lifeless body while Chanel announces that they've made their \\"own ghost story\\". Production Nick Jonas and Niecy Nash return as special guest stars, playing Boone Clemens, the former member of the Dickie Dollar Scholars who faked his death and the ally of the Red Devil, and Denise Hemphill, the kick-butt but odd security guard.

She became most widely known for The Great Cosmic Mother, a cross-disciplinary study that cites numerous archaeological, anthropological, historical and mythological texts and artifacts as evidence of women's role as creators and first practitioners of humanity's earliest religious and cultural belief systems. She was published by Athena Press, WomanSpirit, Second Porcupine Press, Harper & Row, and The Oliver Arts & Open Press. Her poetry was included in Fired Up with You : Poems of a Niagara Vision, edited by the poet Will inman (Border Press 1977) Beat origins Attracted by the Beat Movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Mor lived and wrote in the Santa Cruz Mountains, Baja California, and Los Angeles before settling in San Diego to attend San Diego State University, where she became deeply involved with the Feminist Movement. She taught poetry, gave readings and lectures, and helped compile and edit a variety of poetry anthologies, as well as being Poetry Editor for WomanSpirit magazine. Early work Mor spent the mid-1970s in Taos, New Mexico. During this period she wrote and published three volumes of poetry, Bitter Root Rituals in WomanSpirit 1975, Mother Tongue 1977, and Winter Ditch (Second Porcupine Press, 1982). =The Great Cosmic Mother= When Mor published The Great Cosmic Mother in 1987, the book met with immediate critical acclaim. It has never been out of print and remains on the curricula of many college and university Women's Studies and Mythology programs. It was considered an important reference books for students who studying ancient history and religion by the School Library Journal. Mor's original and preferred title for the book was 'The First God', but her choice was over-ruled by publisher Harper & Row. The book began as a short pamphlet written in the 1970s by Monica Sj√∂√∂, a Swedish artist, writer, and feminist. Mor and Sj√∂√∂, having learned of one another through WomanSpirit magazine, collaborated in expanding the pamphlet to an 80-page small book, which was published by Rainbow Press, in Trondheim, Norway, in 1981. However, after this time Mor dedicated herself, independently, to research, extend, deepen, and expand the book to its present heft of almost 500 pages, this being the volume that was published in 1987 by Harper & Row. Said the publisher at that time, \\"For this American edition, the book has been completely rewritten and updated by Barbara Mor.\\" Mor's comprehensive analysis of world mythologies traces the origin of ancient spiritual beliefs, ceremonies, and rituals as related to Women. She argues that the goddess-centered beliefs that dated from humanity's Paleolithic age were violently destroyed and replaced by war-like patriarchal cultures and religions during the rise of agriculture and the erection of the first cities in Sumeria and elsewhere. With the displacement of matriarchy by patriarchy, the foundations of \\"modernity\\" were laid down, helping explain the rise of war, the manifestation of the Inquisition, and even the Salem witchcraft trials. With royalties for The Great Cosmic Mother late in coming, Mor attempted to parley the success of the book into a teaching position, but ultimately could not find even menial work and ended up destitute and homeless for several years. She moved to Portland, Oregon in the 1990s, but her experience of homelessness and poverty in the American southwest even as The Great Cosmic Mother was being taught in colleges throughout the country provided much of the material for her next and last two books The Blue Rental and The Victory of Sex and Metal. Later work =The Blue Rental= Mor's years as a self-described \\"bag lady\\" in the southwest provide the scenery and thematic backdrop to her collection of prose-pieces, The Blue Rental (The Oliver Arts & Open Press, 2011). Most of the narratives included in The Blue Rental take place in Arizona and New Mexico and focus on poverty, violence ‚Äì particularly against women ‚Äì and trying to survive in a culture hostile to both poverty and women. =The Victory of Sex & Metal= Mor's last finished work, a 60-page long-poem, was posthumously published by The Oliver Arts & Open Press in October, 2015. The poem takes place in an impoverished urban region of the American Southwest and examines the bleak psychological and external and physical landscapes of a destitute young woman and her male partner living hard lives in the ruthless and unforgiving environment of a modern American city.

It was built in 1944 for T H Spencer (mill owner) by Wilson Hart Limited. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 September 2010.  History  The Elgin Vale sawmill, an open- air timber structure containing a steam operated mill, was built in 1944 by Wilson Hart Limited of Maryborough, replacing an earlier sawmill established in 1927. Queensland's pastoral frontier and its associated disruption of traditional Aboriginal lifestyles spread throughout the Wide Bay-Burnett district during the 1840s. In 1847 John Mortimer selected Manumbar, a holding between Nanango and present day Goomeri, which included the site of the Elgin Vale sawmill. When land was resumed from the Gallangowan run of Manumbar in 1878, were set aside for a Camping and Water Reserve (R.81) at the confluence of the Gallangowan and Moonda-Waamba Creeks. It was on Mortimer's recommendation that this area was gazetted, as it was the only permanent source of water in the locality. The following year Messrs J & A Porter took up much of the surrounding land, constructing a homestead \\"Elgin Vale\\" in close proximity to the reserve. By the 1870s, timbergetters were working in the South Burnett, servicing the small local markets of Nanango and Kilkivan and hauling logs to Queensland's \\"timberopolis\\", Maryborough. The construction of the branch railway to Kilkivan from Theebine in 1886 enabled logs and sawn timber to be sent to Maryborough and Brisbane more efficiently, creating conditions for a viable and larger scale timber industry in the South Burnett. Timber revenue provided the chief justification for the extension of the Kilkivan branch line and after extending through to Goomeri (1902), Murgon (1904) and Kingaroy (1904), the timber industry was a major contributor to the initial growth of these settlements. In townships and in close proximity to forested areas, numerous steam operated sawmills were established to process timber. The first sawmill located on Camping and Water Reserve 81, (also known as Scrubby Paddock), was established by Ross and Company in 1908. This operation is thought to have moved to Goomeri in 1914. While the softwood vine forests of the South Burnett contained a variety of millable trees, it was the abundance of hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), in towering stands on the ridges and ranges, that provided much of the district's timber. Easily worked, with a fine, uniform grain, the pale cream to light yellow-brown wood of the hoop pine was widely used in the construction of timber buildings throughout Queensland, as well as for decorative and other purposes. The hilly terrain immediately south of Camping and Water Reserve 81 was dense with hoop pine and in 1914 an area of was gazetted as State Forest R.154. Just outside Kilkivan, about north of the Elgin Vale site, Mudlo National Park currently protects one of the area's few remaining stands of native hoop pine vine forest, which illustrates its attraction for the timber industry. In 1926, TH (Harry) Spencer began negotiations to establish a new mill at Elgin Vale, with the intent of shifting his sawmill at Sefton (north of Kilkivan) to the reserve. Spencer had previous involvement in timber industry of the Wide Bay-Burnett and came to play a prominent role in civic and business interests in the (former) Kilkivan Shire. In March 1926, the year Queensland began to formally regulate the amount of timber that could be cut in State Forests and Timber Reserves, Spencer negotiated with the Queensland Provisional Forestry Board to procure 10 million super feet of hoop pine timber from State Forest Reserve 154, adjacent to Reserve 81. In conjunction with this agreement, Spencer received permission from the Lands Department and Kilkivan Shire Council to establish a large sawmill at an estimated cost of , with a special lease of five years. In September 1926, Spencer's lease was extended to seven years, while the area of land under lease was enlarged to encompass the whole of the reserve. The need to extend the area of land under lease was determined by the need to provide accommodation for employees. The development of small self- contained \\"timber towns\\" in relatively remote locations occurred throughout the Wide-Bay Burnett. Other examples existed at Wengenville, Manumbar and Eel Creek. At Elgin Vale, two houses for the manager and tally clerk, a number of smaller family cottages, a boarding house, and barracks for single men were constructed. A small school was also built on the reserve, which remained in operation until 1977 (later adapted to a QCWA meeting room and regazetted to form a separate reserve). When a new set of barracks were later built (s), the earlier building was converted into a community hall, which became an important social space for the settlement. In 1961 two houses, seven cottages, a set of barrack's and community hall (in addition to the sawmill and detached office) were recorded on-site. During 1926‚Äì27, Spencer moved all of the machinery and building materials from the mill from Sefton to Elgin Vale, with commercial processing of timber underway by late 1927. After expending considerable effort to establish the milling operations and provision for workers, Spencer owned the mill for a very short period. At the end of 1927, Wilson Hart Company Limited, a long established timber company of Maryborough (1866), had taken over operations. After relinquishing ownership, Spencer operated the mill on behalf of Wilson Hart, maintaining the logging contract to provide timber and to haul milled timber to Goomeri railway station into the 1940s. During his operations at Elgin Vale, Spencer was responsible for introducing modern forms of transport in the district to obtain and transport timber, in the form of Linn caterpillar tractors (the first in Queensland) and motorised trucks. During operations between 1927 and 1930, the mill's output included 150 000 butter boxes for the Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Association, linking what were then two of the region's most important industries. The effect of the Depression caused periods of closure at the mill during the 1930s, a common occurrence at this time at sawmills across the state. The 1934 burning of Wilson Hart's sawmill at Maryborough saw the relocation of a large number of staff to Elgin Vale. This was a particularly active period at the mill, with three shifts worked over a 24-hour day and the timber town's small population temporarily swelling to accommodate the extra workers. During World War II, the heavy demand for timbers, for defence and other \\"essential uses\\" made Queensland's timber industry a protected trade. In this period, the Elgin Vale mill was sending sawn timber to Wilson Hart's Maryborough mill for the production of ammunition boxes. A fire in May 1944 completely destroyed the 1927 Elgin Vale sawmill, with only the sawn timber in the yard saved. By October of that year, Wilson Hart had constructed a new mill, probably in the same position as the previous structure. The position and internal layout of the Elgin Vale mill followed the basic design principles for steam powered softwood sawmills of the era, to maximise efficient movement of logs through the mill. The sloping foreground on the southern side of the mill, inset with a series of large logs ramp-assisted the movement of large logs onto the rolling (Canadian) bench, where they were split by the breaking down saw. From here the flitches (long lengths of timber), were transported across wooden skids to the \\"number one bench\\", to be cut into boards. If required, boards and off-cuts were then resized at the \\"number two bench\\". Both the \\"one\\" and \\"two\\" saws had docking benches for further cutting of required lengths. Waste timber, used for the boiler's furnace and for fruit cases was sent down a chute close to the number two bench. Narrower logs were also processed through the frame saw. Vertical saws contained within the frame cut a number of boards simultaneously, with the feed grips of the frame adjusting automatically to the taper of the log. A planing machine for further processing was originally located in the north- eastern corner of the mill, but was later removed. Once cut to the desired specification, the sawn timber was transported on trolleys aligned to rail lines into the holding yard at the eastern end of the mill to season. The mill was positioned close to the banks of Moonda-Waamba Creek to procure water for the boiler. Situated below the main floor, in the north-west corner were the boiler, engine and drive equipment. The engine, manufactured by T Robinson and Son of England, is thought to have been originally used at a sawmill in Drayton in the early 1900s before being moved to Elgin Vale. Water (which required chemical treatment because of 'hardness') was pumped up to a water tank from Moonda-Waamba Creek and heated by the boiler's furnace, fed on the mill's by-products of sawdust and off-cuts. The steam generated from the boiler powered the engine. A drive belt set over the engine's flywheel was attached to the main drive shaft, and pulleys attached to the shaft drove the various saws on the main floor. Also below the main floor was a workspace for maintenance and sharpening saws, situated near the main engine. Another area was set aside to cut waste timber into fruit cases, which would then be parcelled up and sent away for assembly, with two men generally working at this task. By the end of the 1940s, the State Forests and Timber Reserves of the South Burnett provided just over 20 percent of Queensland's pine. There were around forty sawmills in the district and during 1947‚Äì48, nearly of timber was loaded at South Burnett railway stations. At this time, the Elgin Vale sawmill was thought to be one of the state's largest. Although electricity became available at Elgin Vale in 1965, the steam driven operations of the mill were maintained, with electricity only used for lighting. Between 1968 and 1979, the mill's daily operations varied from 5000 to 23 000 superfeet a day, dependent on various factors such as availability of timber, weather and machinery problems. In 1971, Elgin Vale's licence allowed for the production of 642 000 superfeet of timber a year. While Elgin Vale may not have been the most modern mill in its latter decades, it continued to be a viable operation into the 1970s. The quality of the hoop pine sawn at Elgin Vale ensured a constant demand and a ready market for its product. Because of the relative remoteness of Elgin Vale from its parent company in Maryborough, the mill was largely self-contained, with the staff largely responsible for maintaining and conducting necessary repairs to the steam operations and other components of the mill. In 1978 Wilson Hart was brought out by the Carrick's Group. Following the acquisition, Carrick's disposed of a significant portion of Wilson Hart's assets and the Elgin Vale mill was placed in the Wood Product's division, separate from other former Wilson Hart operations. By 1986, the Elgin Vale sawmill had exhausted its allocation of timber in the district. Elgin Vale's use of superseded steam- driven technology, in an era when sawmills throughout the Wide Bay-Burnett region were becoming increasingly larger and modernised, coupled with a downturn in the building industry, increased its vulnerability to demise. During its final year, the mill resorted to purchasing timber from elsewhere to supplement its operations. At this time, an average of 20 cubic metres was processed daily, with 11 men employed on-site. The Elgin Vale sawmill ceased operating as a commercial venture on 16 March 1987, with manager Bob Mercer running the last log through the mill. Following the closure of the sawmill, the Kilkivan and Nanango Shire Councils purchased the mill and remaining buildings, with the intent of maintaining the site as a museum. The original boiler was replaced with one formerly located at Kingaroy Hospital. A large store room, 2 six-roomed dwellings, 3 five-roomed dwellings and other miscellaneous items were all sold for removal from the site. The manager's and tally clerk's houses were retained, renovated and a caretaker was established on-site. In 1993, Nanango Shire Council ended their involvement with the Elgin Vale sawmill. Kilkivan Shire Council retained responsibility for the mill, publishing a book on its history in 1997. Following council amalgamations in 2008, ownership of the mill was transferred to Gympie Regional Council. As recently as 2006 the steam driven operations of the Elgin Vale sawmill were operated for visitors, offering an insight into a now rare, but once common practice throughout the Wide Bay Burnett/Queensland region.  Description  The Elgin Vale sawmill complex stands at the end of a short access road east of the intersection of the Manumbar-Nanango Road and the Goomeri-Elgin Vale Road, Elgin Vale, approximately southwest of Gympie. The complex comprises a large open mill shed, detached office, remnants of the former mill township, two cottages and a toilet shed. = Mill shed = The milling operation is accommodated in a large, rectangular open sided timber framed shed standing on a site sloping down to the northeast. It is sheltered by a gabled roof clad with corrugated iron sheeting with the roof line notable for two small decorative projecting gable roofs to the southwest side. The milling operations are organised around the main floor of the shed which has narrow platforms running along the short sides, a workshop standing to the east corner and the boiler/engine room standing to the north. The northwest platform, workshop and boiler/engine room are sheltered by skillion roofs. A small rectangular enclosed office stands within the shed to the south. An elevated hardwood timber floor supported on round timber stumps provides a platform for the milling plant with the drive shafts, belts and pulleys accommodated below connecting to the steam driven flywheel. A line of large round logs perpendicular to the mill floor is along the southwest side of the shed forming a log ramp feeding logs to the breakdown saw bench. The milling plant comprises benches, rollers, saws and other milling plant (all retain pulleys and belts), winches, a gantry crane and tramways (timber and steel rails) with trolleys. A winch stands in the yard to the southwest of the log ramp The traverser rails and trolley run along the southeast side on a narrow timber platform lower than the main floor. A set of timber stairs descends to the northwest from the timber floored walkway along the northwest side. Two boilers, a steam engine and a large flywheel stand at ground level to the north corner with a corrugated iron water tank on a tall timber standing further to the north. A tall metal stack projects from the boiler. Two timber framed and clad shutes between the workshop and boiler room discharge to the waste/sawdust and boiler/furnace areas to the northeast. = Office = The mill office is a small rectangular timber framed and weather board clad building supported on low timber stumps and sheltered by a corrugated iron clad gable roof standing up the slope to the southeast of the mill shed. An open rectangular entrance porch is accommodated to the east corner from which two solid timber doors (northwest and southwest) open into the office. Other openings include a solid timber door to the centre of the southwest side and small windows to the northwest and northeast sides. = Township = The remains of the township are on land that slopes up gently to the south of the mill shed. Approached along a dirt track south of the mill office, the remnants include timber stumps, concrete slabs, pieces of metal sheeting, small piles of debris, timber and barbed- wire fencing and three electrical poles, most lying to the west side of the track. The area is now grassed and has a scatter of vegetation. = Cottages and toilet shed = Two timber cottages and a small timber shed accommodating toilets stand to the southwest of the mill shed. The interiors of these cottages are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Elgin Vale Sawmill was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 September 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Elgin Vale sawmill is important in demonstrating the development and subsequent decline of steam driven sawmilling operations in the Wide-Bay Burnett region, an important region associated with Queensland's timber industry. Built in 1944 to replace an earlier mill established in 1927, it was thought to have been one of the state's largest sawmills by the late 1940s. The Elgin Vale sawmill, in its retention of original fabric and layout, is exceptional for its ability to demonstrate the process of using steam technology to mill the natural resource of hoop pine, historically one of Queensland's principal building materials. The Elgin Vale sawmill is important in demonstrating the pattern of establishing softwood sawmills in close proximity to naturally occurring stands of hoop pine, while the remains of the township, constructed from 1927, demonstrate the associated provision of accommodation for workers and their families in relatively remote timber milling locations in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Elgin Vale sawmill is a rare example in Queensland of a steam driven softwood sawmill in operating condition, demonstrated in its substantial level of intactness and high degree of integrity. Steam driven sawmills were once common throughout Queensland with around 40 operating in the Wide Bay-Burnett district alone in the 1940s. There are no known sawmills in Queensland comparable to the Elgin Vale sawmill in terms of retention of original layout, fabric and operating ability. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The remains of the Elgin Vale township, established in 1927 to accommodate workers and their families associated with the sawmill, have the potential to contribute to our understanding of the organisation and domestic life of timber settlements that existed in twentieth century Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The substantially intact Elgin Vale sawmill is an exceptional example of a steam driven softwood sawmill, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. Located adjacent to a creek for water and in close proximity to well timbered areas, the mill is positioned below sloping ground to assist the movement of logs. Internally, the layout and the sequence designed to maximise the efficient movement and cutting of logs within the sawmill remain: the long open-sided tin and timber shed, log ramp, breakdown saw, number one and two saw, frame saw, docking benches, waste chute, rails and trolleys. Below the main floor are the boiler, engine and attached drive equipment that provide the power for the operations on the main floor. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Elgin Vale sawmill site is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place possesses evocative qualities, generated by the strong visual impact of a tough industrial aesthetic of weathered timber and corrugated galvanised iron, juxtaposed with its quiet rural setting. The remains of the township evoke a sense of isolation and decline of a self-contained way of life that has largely vanished in Queensland.

History James Ogilivy, the 5th Lord of Airlie, built Forter Castle as a \\"fortalice\\" (fortification) in 1560 to protect the Balloch Pass route to Glenshee from intrusion. One report explains the rationale for the building: \\"At the time of construction, marauding bands of caterans threatened the settled folk in this area and the clan feuds, stoked by religious differences, as Protestantism came in to supplant the old Catholic religion, made it necessary to build a new fortalice for the house of Ogilvy\\". James Ogilvy‚Äôs grandson James Ogilvy, the 7th Lord of Airlie, was named the 1st Earl of Airlie by Charles II in 1639. In 1650, James refused to sign the National Covenant, so Forter castle was burnt down by the Duke of Argyll, Archibald Campbell, along with Airlie Castle. The Ogilvys moved to Cortachy Castle. =Restoration= In 1988, the castle was purchased by Robert Pooley who decided to rebuild and refurnish it with guidance from Scottish Heritage. The exterior work consumed two years. A summary of the project states that \\"they studied the scarring in the remaining stones to recreate the original layout of a traditional L-shaped 16th century fortified house. The only deliberate change was to make the Laird‚Äôs bedroom the full expanse of the castle and the same dimensions as the Great Hall\\". The interior renovations and decorating started afterwards.\\"THIS CASTLE FOR SALE AT pounds 1.5MIL; ..but this one's worth only pounds 1.96m.(News).\\" The Mirror (London, England). MGN Ltd. 2007. HighBeam Research. 28 Oct. 2015 The interior of the rebuilt castle was designed by Pooley's daughter, Katharine Pooley. As of 2020, the castle was owned by Katherine Pooley (since 2003); it was used at times by Katherine and her spouse Daniel Voyce. At other times, the castle was rented out on a self-catering basis. The Chapel in the basement was sometimes used for weddings. One report on the completed castle stated that \\"all 21st century creature comforts have been added whilst retaining complete authenticity with the castle‚Äôs original history\\" and that \\"Katharine‚Äôs interior design has incorporated antiquated touches.\\" Architecture An 1899 report by D MacGibbon and T Ross provided these specifics about the castle: > \\"This castle consists of an oblong block c. 39' x 26'6\\" with a tower at the > SE corner measuring c. 21' square, so that it is a variation of the L-plan. > The entrance is in the tower, in the re-entrant angle. Above the main stair > landing - in the tower - the ceiling is vaulted. The ground floor of the > main block was divided into three vaulted compartments, with a passage > leading to them. One of these was the kitchen, and has an unusually large > fireplace. The Hall was on the first floor with a large fireplace in the S > wall, and another in the W wall. Above the Hall, there appears to have been > second and third floors with an attic. On the third floors were corbelled > turrets on the NE and NW angles\\". A 1958 visit to the site by an archaeologist produced this updated summary of its condition at that time: > \\"a roofless ruin of the late 16th century, remaining generally as described > and planned by MacGibbon and Ross ... except that vault and fireplace > features have been destroyed. A circular stair turret protrudes in the re- > entrant angle above the door-way on the S. The rebuilt castle consists of a main block with a wing projecting from the southeast corner. The ground floor of the castle was divided into two cellars and a kitchen, all of them vaulted, although the subdividing walls were missing prior to the restoration The hall is on the first floor and there are another two floors above it with an attic. The kitchen in the basement fills the area that would have been the dungeon in the original building. The castle has five floors. On first floor there is a hall, the second floor has a master bedroom, and the third floor has three more bedrooms.\\"This time it's for keeps This time it's for keeps; PROPERTY.\\" Daily Mail (London).

She was able to archeologically confirm that chocolate was a byproduct of fermenting beer. She is also an expert in evaluating the archaeological records of society and the implications that sexuality and gender play in culture. Biography Rosemary A. Joyce was born in 1956. She is a Professor of Anthropology at UC Berkeley. Research Joyce has conducted social archaeology in Honduras since 1977, focusing on analysis of households, ceramics and the cultural roles of sex and gender which are found in both the material remains and physical remains of Mesoamerican societies. Central America and Mexico were regions where sexuality and gender in ancient societies began being studied in the 1960s. Iconography showed that women had held positions of power in society even though men were more often portrayed than women. Joyce has stated that artistic works show that young males were often subjects being viewed by both men and women, which indicates a more fluid gender spectrum. In a comparative study conducted in tandem with Lynn Meskell, who has done similar studies on ancient Egyptian society, Joyce and Meskell contrast Maya civilization and that of the New Kingdom of Egypt. On the one hand, both societies existed before Plato's concept in dualism‚Äîthe mind and body are separate‚Äîentered into acceptance. Also in both cultures, the archaeological remains tend to be objects, writings, and images of elite males. Both were phallic cultures but in Egyptian imagery the penis is exaggerated and perfect male bodies are the subject of female adoration. In the Mayan culture, penile imagery is also exaggerated, but typically the phallus is hidden, but highlighted, and offered by a young male to the gaze a politically dominant male. Egyptian women appear to be sexualized, even as girls, indicating no demarcation between childhood and adulthood, but Mayan women appear as unsexualized beings and are usually draped unless suckling an infant. Thus studies can give insight not only into how ancient worlds viewed sexuality and gender roles but how objects they used might have been used differently. Spiritual practices also show the concepts of sexuality and gender were different in pre-conquest Mesoamerica, as throughout the region deities, like the Mayan corn or moon gods, had both male and female attributes. Another aspect of Joyce's work was a study conducted with John Henderson, an anthropologist from Cornell University. Traces of cacao found on Honduran pottery shards were examined and discovered to have been used to produce beer. Initially the pod was fermented and the seeds discarded. At some point, ancient beer makers began to use the seeds to make a non-alcoholic beverage, which was a bitter chocolate drink. To confirm their findings, Joyce and Henderson contacted archaeometrist Patrick McGovern and chocolate chemist for Hershey Chocolate, Jeffrey Hurst, to analyze the residues. They confirmed the presence of theobromine, a chemical found in cacao, but rare in other plants. The research connected the Honduran site to Mayan cacao fields which were thousands of kilometers away. Though clear evidence of trade, studying the civilizations in Honduras, Joyce found that they do not have the same social inequality as existed in the Maya world. Institutionalized power did not take hold and evidence points to smaller cities linked together in which \\"women were as likely as men to have held positions of power\\".

It was designed by Frederic Herbert Faircloth and built from 1843 to 1880s circa. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992.  Heritage listing  Barambah Station homestead, 1906 Barambah Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Barambah station was established in 1843 by Ferriter and Uhr in the wake of Henry Stuart Russell's exploration of the Burnett district in 1842. The Barambah site once comprised a complete homestead complex, with some structures reputedly built during the 1870s. Today, the timber residence built in -06 stands as testimony to the development of Barambah as one of the earliest principal pastoral holdings in the Burnett district. The physical improvement of the site reflects the growth of the Queensland rural economy during the early 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Despite extensive renovations to the house, the main original divisions between the living areas and private spaces, such as bedrooms, and the internal core and encircling verandahs, remain intact, with the exception of the rear enclosed vernadah areas. The place demonstrates the principal characteristics of a substantial Queensland timber residence built in the first decade of the 20th century. The significant associated buildings present in the homestead complex assist in demonstrating how this kind of pastoral property would have operated. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Drawing Room, 1914 The residence exhibits a high standard of workmanship and architectural design, and its elevated position, amidst early garden remnants and overlooking a watercourse, enhances the aesthetic appeal of the site. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Barambah has a special association with the Moore family, who owned the property for nearly 100 years and who developed it during that time as one of the pre-eminent cattle stations in the Burnett district.

History  Hall of Memory, Goomeri, 1930 The Hall of Memory at Goomeri was opened in 1926 to commemorate all those from the district who had served in World War I, but this dedication has since been extended to also honour all those who have served in subsequent wars. European settlement in the district took place in 1843‚Äì50 as large pastoral holdings were taken up. By 1870 these had been subdivided into smaller grazing farms. In 1902, the Nanango railway line reached Goomeri and at that time was used principally by local farmers and to transport timber. In 1911, a sale of town commercial and residential blocks was held. More farms were established and a butter factory was built. The town of Goomeri developed with a school, showground and churches as a rural district centre in the 1930s. The First World War (1914‚Äì1918), although fought in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, had a profound impact on Australia. At the outbreak of war Australia, settled as a British colony and with strong ties to the \\"motherland\\", immediately entered the war in support of Britain and her allies. Over 300,000 Australians out of a population of 4 million volunteered for service overseas, with approximately 60,000 of these making the supreme sacrifice. Virtually every Australian community, including that of Goomeri, lost young men in this war. Following the war, most communities wished to erect a memorial for those who served, and particularly those who had not returned. At Goomeri, a memorial was erected in Digger Perrett Park, although the Goomeri War Memorial Clock, which stands opposite the site, replaced this in 1940. The Goomeri sub- branch of the RSL received its charter on 1 January 1926 and members of this branch were a driving force behind the establishment of the Hall of Memory. A public meeting was held in March 1926 and a Memorial Hall Building Committee comprising Messrs. Mayne, Stanton, Wimberley, Maudsley and Wise was appointed with authority to obtain land and a building for use as a community hall. At the time, this was not a common form of memorial, most tributes to Queensland volunteers and war dead being monuments. It was not until the wake of World War II that such practical memorials as buildings and community facilities were favoured, so that the Goomeri Hall of Memory is one of only a small number of such buildings remaining. The building committee purchased an existing timber store building from Cuthbert Butt at Nanango and A Kopp and W Toop had erected it on the site by May 1926. A crow's ash floor was laid for dancing and the hall was painted. It was initially leased to a Mr A Rich, who moved his silent picture show there from Boonara. Mrs Rich had a sweet stall under the hall, which appears to have been enclosed soon after the relocation. Funds to clear the debt and cover the purchase of furniture, crockery and other essential items were raised by holding a series of events from 1927. These included a concert and ball, a sports day and procession and a popular girl competition, won by Myrtle Wieland who was also one of the cinema pianists. These events were announced to have cleared the debt of at Easter 1929 with a surplus of just . Debutantes Ball at the Hall of Memory, 1930s In 1931 a large supper room with a kitchen was added. This room was also used for meetings and small functions. In 1935 sections of wall were removed between the hall and the enclosed verandahs to increase available space. Mr A Duffy held a long lease on the hall to show films. He also acted as caretaker and installed electricity and equipment to show \\"talkies\\". In the 1940s he became one of the first operators in the country to install CinemaScope. During the Second World War, the basement area was used to store of emergency supplies for the area in case of Japanese invasion. Following the war these were removed and the area was partitioned as clubrooms for the RSL. The Citizen's Military Forces also used the RSL space as a drill room and the grounds of the hall for parades. World War II memorials to match those for WWI were ordered in 1950 from Smiths Rubber Stamp, Brass Plate and Stencil Manufacturing Coy in Brisbane for the sum of 7 guineas each. Murray Studios in Gympie supplied the photographs and the memorials were unveiled on Anzac Day 1951. In the 1950s, the demand for film shows fell. Films were shown only once a week and were eventually discontinued in the late 1950s, although the hall continued to be used for other events. In 1971, the Kilkivan Shire Council accepted responsibility for the hall at the Trustee's request. Following this, the kitchens were modernised and a bar and cold room installed at the supper room end of the hall. The RSL kitchenette was modernised in 1991 and it is thought that the hall was re-roofed in 1995. The hall is still in regular use for a wide range of entertainments and social functions.  Description  The Hall of Memory is a high set timber building with a corrugated iron roof, which is prominently sited on Boonara Street, at the corner of McGregor Street, Goomeri. It is set in well-tended gardens and comprises a rectangular hall with a gabled roof and a smaller gabled addition set at one end. To the rear, toilet blocks are connected to the hall and it has been built in underneath to form a basement storey. The main hall is a long rectangular building with its long axis presented to the street elevation. Along this elevation is an enclosed verandah and central gabled porch entry flanked by stairs. On the porch gable is the Commonwealth coat of arms surmounted by the words \\"Hall of Memory 1914 ‚Äì 1918\\". A decorative timber ventilator surmounts the main roof. Attached to one side of the hall is the smaller separately roofed building which has a front verandah and separate stair entry. The main hall is lined with beaded boards and has a timber ceiling and floor. One end has a stage with a curved front and a space for a piano to one side. The rear of the room has a modern bar with a projection box over. The access stair to be projection box has been removed to accommodate a steel cold room. Behind the bar is a large supper room leading into kitchens. There is a large kitchen range in the smaller room to the rear, although a modern cooking stove and kitchen cabinets have been installed in the larger room. Inside the main room of the hall are a number of memorials. These include a modern timber roll of honour for Goomeri and District; timber framed metal honour rolls for World War I and 21 individual memorials in the form of decorative bronze plaques with an inset photograph of those honoured. Nine are for the First World War and twelve for World War II. There is also a benefactors' memorial in the form of an open metallic book on a marble plaque. It reads: In grateful memory of John T Mayne a patriotic benefactor and Mary Mayne his wife and partner in benevolence. The verandah along the front of the hall has been built in with casement windows glazed with obscure and green glass. There are large openings from the hall into them forming two long rooms. The central porch contains a ticket box accessed by a door in the hall and flanked by pairs of entry doors into the hall. The basement area has been built in and has high, narrow windows. The toilet block on the corner is constructed of fibrous cement planks on a base of concrete blocks and has a skillion roof and sliding aluminium windows.

The Goomeri Hall of Memory demonstrates the principal characteristics of a building designed for the use, both recreational and administrative, of returned soldiers and their families, with its honour rolls, meeting rooms, supper room, and dance hall. The large hall remains important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type, with a timber floor laid especially for dancing, a stage, supper room and large banks of windows to the street elevation. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Hall of Memory has landmark qualities as a large and well-detailed building on a prominent elevated site and makes a major contribution to the character of the townscape of Goomeri. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Goomeri Hall of Memory has a spiritual and social association with the Returned Services League as both a war memorial and a meeting place. It also has a special association with community of Goomeri and district because of its long use for many social functions, including balls, concerts and the showing of films.

It was built in 1940. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. History The Goomeri War Memorial Clock was unveiled on 15 November 1940 by RSL State President Raymond Douglas Huish. The concrete memorial honours the 9 local men who fell in the First World War and the 12 who fell in the Second World War. Goomeri Memorial Clock Tower was unveiled with the names of the local men who died in service or killed in action during the First World War. The names of those killed in the Second World War were added later. It was erected at a cost of which was raised by the Goomeri Returned Services League Sub-Branch. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60 000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the digger statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair. Although many different types of war memorials were erected throughout Queensland, the clock type of memorial was comparatively rare. It is not known who designed the memorial; however the metal work was produced by Ernest Gunderson and was originally part of an earlier monument which also commemorated the First World War. Gunderson established his metalworking company in Brisbane after migrating from Norway. The company operated until the mid 1930s and supplied honour boards and plates for memorials statewide. His work was distinctly original, often incorporating both Australian and British motifs. The monument is painted, with details now picked out in darker colours. Description World War I list of deaths, 2019 The First World War Memorial is situated in a traffic island in one of the main intersections of Goomeri. It is a dominant landscape feature from most locations in the town. The traffic island is located in the centre of the intersection, level with the road on the eastern side and dropping away on the western side. A flagpole is located on the north side of the monument which sits on a stepped concrete pad with short square concrete bollards at each corner. The painted concrete monument rises to a height of and comprises a tapered tower with clockfaces at the apex. Fixed to the west face of the foundation and to the north face of the clocktower are metal components from Goomeri's former memorial to the First World War. The tower is subtly divided into three sections: a base, the body and the clock. The base has shallow simply moulded details around the base and at each corner and has applied moulding at the termination of the base section. A substantial metal door bearing a bronze Australian Coat of Arms surrounded by a laurel wreath is recessed into the north face. The dates 1914 and 1919 are located above and below the wreath, also in bronze. On each of the other faces are polished granite plaques with the engraved names of those who made the Supreme Sacrifice (died). The southern face bears the names of the nine who fell in the First World War and the dates 1914 ‚Äì 1919. The western face displays the names of the twelve who fell in the Second World War, and the eastern face is blank. Above the base is the body of the tower which is plain except for a simple central decorative element, painted dark brown. The uppermost section of the body has stop-chamfers to each corner which continue into the clock section. The clock itself is located at the top of the tower and comprises four faces which are illuminated at night. The letters \\"Lest we forget\\" (reading clockwise) replace the numerals on each clock face.  Heritage listing  Goomeri War Memorial Clock was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. It also has special association with Brisbane metalworker Ernest Gunderson as an example of his workmanship. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is one of the few memorials in Queensland in the form of a clock tower and has uncommon decorative features. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. Unveiled in 1940, the war memorial at Goomeri demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the use of appropriate materials and design elements. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The memorial is of aesthetic significance as a dominant landmark in the main intersection of Goomeri, being the reason the town is known as 'the Clock Town.' The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has a strong and continuing association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event and as the focal point for the remembrance of that event.

Etymology The name of the place was originated from the local word \\"kinalasan\\" which means the flesh shredded off from the carcass of a wild cimaron. It was said by old folks that people before had the difficulty of pronouncing the word that eventually led to its change of name to \\"Kinalansan\\". Historical account The place is near Sabang, thus, the life of the people is usually affected by the frequent raids of Moro pirates. Because of this difficult situation, the people could not work at their farms which led them to butcher their livestocks and animals for food. The manner of butchering their animals was done accordingly by separating the flesh from the bones which they called as \\"pagkalas\\". While the flesh is being consumed as food, the bones were collected and hanged on the trees which the natives called as \\"kinalasan\\". It was in this account that the place was called \\"kinalasan\\", and later, a Spanish priest changed it to \\"kinalansan\\" due to people during those times had the difficulty of pronouncing the word \\"kinalasan\\".

It was built circa 1915 by Queensland Railways to facilitate settlement in the Mary River Valley. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2011.  History  The Imbil Railway Bridge over Yabba Creek is located near the town of Imbil on the Mary Valley branch railway (now the Mary Valley Rattler line) from Monkland station on the North Coast railway line. The Mary Valley railway line between Monkland station and Brooloo in the upper Mary Valley was constructed between 1911 and April 1915 to facilitate closer settlement of the Mary River valley. The Imbil Railway Bridge remains as evidence of the economic importance of the Mary Valley to Queensland agriculture during the 20th century. This half-through Pratt truss (or Pony truss) bridge, completed in January 1915, is one of only six bridges of this kind known to be remaining in Queensland. European settlement in the Mary Valley commenced when squatters took up pastoral leases there in the 1850s. Closer settlement in the Mary Valley started after half of Imbil station land was resumed for settlement under the Crown Lands Act 1868 and made available for selection. The gradual opening of the large pastoral holdings of Amamoor, Imbil and Traveston in the Upper Mary River Valley for closer settlement from the late 1870s was a catalyst for the development of small cropping and dairying activities in the region. The changing patterns of land use and settlement in the Mary Valley occurred while nearby Gympie evolved from its beginnings as a makeshift settlement and alluvial field of late 1867 into an important regional town and major deep reef gold producer by the 1880s. The township provided a ready market for the growing number of agricultural producers in the surrounding district. In the Mary Valley, maize and potatoes were the dominant early crops, although experimental plantings of tobacco, rice, sugar cane, peas and pineapples were also undertaken. At the beginning of the 20th century the Queensland government promoted the construction of branch railways in rural areas to assist growth in population and agricultural production. In the 1880s a Mary Valley route had been among the proposals for the line from Brisbane to Gympie, but was rejected. Local agitation for a Mary Valley branch railway (with varying proposals for the route's alignment) increased during the 1900s. The Railway Commissioner investigated and surveyed a proposed line for the Mary Valley in 1910, with the accompanying report contending \\"considerable traffic in agricultural produce, timber, livestock and dairy products\\" would eventuate. Subsequently, a route deviating from the North Coast line at Monkland (south of Gympie) and extending to Brooloo was approved, a decision aided by the availability of timber for freight and construction, and Gympie City Council's offer to fund 1/3 of construction costs. Work commenced in June 1911 and by 1913, 550 men were working on the project. The Mary Valley Railway Line included four major (concrete and steel) bridges and one tunnel at Melawondi. The line reached Kandanga in February 1914 and the terminus of Brooloo in April 1915, the month the whole line was officially opened for passenger and goods traffic. Along the line, subdivisions of a number of larger holdings into farm and town allotments near rail stops increased the availability agricultural land for settlers and led to establishment of small townships at Kandanga (1912), Brooloo, Imbil and Amamoor (1914) and Dagun (1917). The Imbil Railway Bridge illustrates the evolution in the principal characteristics of steel railway bridges around the turn of the century, especially the change to the through and half-through Pratt trusses from 1908, which increased the structural strength of rail bridges. Early rail bridges in Queensland were half-through or deck-type lattice girders with through hogback central spans until the 1893 after which the Whipple truss (double intersection through Pratt truss) was used for strength until the introduction of the through Pratt truss in 1897. For the next two decades many of Queensland's rail bridges were of the through Pratt design, including the half-through Pratt for lighter loads (introduced 1909), which features top and bottom chords connected by vertical and diagonal members but no portal or lateral bracing between the two parallel trusses on either side of the rail deck. The Warren truss was introduced later. During the interwar period the rapid increase in production in the Mary Valley made a significant contribution to the Gympie region's status as one of Queensland's most productive dairy areas. In response to cream supply outgrowing production capacity, the Wide Bay Co-Operative built what was claimed as Australia's largest butter factory in 1925, and was receiving cream from 2,000 suppliers by 1935. By 1927 the Gympie district was responsible for 10% of Queensland's milk production, the majority of which was used for butter making. In 1929 the Wide Bay district (of which Gympie was a part) was the second highest milk producer after the Moreton district, and by 1939 the 12 butter factories in the Wide Bay-Burnett region (not including Cooroy), produced almost 1/3 of Queensland's butter. In the same year, 4,500 cream cans were forwarded from Kandanga alone. In 1952 the Gympie district produced 15% of Queensland's butter, and 1953 was the Wide Bay Co-Operative's record year for payment to its suppliers. However, a downturn began in the 1950s, which reflected changes occurring across the industry in Queensland. Butter consumption per capita in Australia dropped from to between 1957 and 1972, and a major butter market was lost in the early 1970s, after Britain joined the European Economic Community. Changing to milk production rather than cream, required larger herds and new equipment, and resulted in many small-scale farmers leaving the industry or switching to beef cattle. Stricter regulations for the running of dairies, lower prices, foreign imports and competition from margarine producers all took their toll. Between 1973 and 1976 28% of the Wide Bay Co-op's farmers left the industry. As milk production increased, farm storage in vats and road transportation by tankers became the norm. The last butter was churned in Gympie in May 1978, ending nearly 80 years of production at the site. While fruit continued to be transported on the Mary Valley railway following the demise of cream production, the line became increasingly unprofitable during the 1970s. By the late 1980s, the future of the line was increasingly precarious. In 1988 station masters/mistresses were removed from Imbil, Amamoor and Dagun and a number of railway buildings such as goods sheds, waiting sheds and residences were sold for removal. The reduction of infrastructure and services on the railway made it increasingly apparent that the line was to close. Strong protests by the district's pineapple growers helped to delay any final decision on the line's future. However, the last goods train ran to Kandanga in 1995 and thereafter pineapple growers took their produce to Traveston station on the Brisbane-Gympie North line. Despite this, the line was not formally closed and in 1996 the Mary Valley Heritage Railway Board negotiated to conduct tourist train services on the line. The Mary Valley Heritage Railway commenced operations on the former Mary Valley branch on 23 May 1998. The \\"Valley Rattler\\" steam train tours and rail motor rides have since become a major tourist attraction for the region. A large group of volunteers and trainees contribute to the operation and maintenance of the line, rolling stock and buildings between the (former) Gympie railway station and Imbil railway station. The Imbil Railway Bridge remains as evidence of the economic importance of the Mary Valley to the Queensland dairy industry during the 20th century. The Imbil Railway Bridge is a rare intact example of a half-through Pratt truss railway bridge, a style of bridge used by Queensland's Railway Department in the first three decades of the 20th century. The half-through Pratt truss structure, which differs subtly from the more widely used through Pratt truss bridge, in that its girders are not high enough to allow cross bracing at the top between the trusses on each side of the bridge. Half-through Pratt truss bridges were designed to carry a smaller load than through Pratt truss bridges. Other intact bridges of this type that are extant are: Harlin Rail Bridge, Harlin (1912); Sleeper Log Creek (1915); Saltwater Creek (1915); Crystal Creek (1916) and Murray Creek (1923).  Description  Imbil Railway Bridge, 2009 The Imbil Rail Bridge is a high level steel and concrete bridge over Yabba Creek, located from Monkland on the Mary Valley branch line. Its total length is and its maximum span is . The bridge has five steel eight-panel half-through Pratt trusses and is supported by two concrete abutments and nine concrete piers. The bridge comprises (North to South): * 2 √ó 3 x rolled steel joists, decking, concrete abutment, common concrete pier on cylindrical base (piers 1 and 2); * 5 x riveted 8-panel half- through Pratt trusses, decking, common concrete piers with octagonal ends with capping on cylindrical bases (piers 2 to 7); * 2 √ó 3 x rolled steel joists, decking, common concrete pier on cylindrical base, concrete abutment (piers 7 and 8). It retains its rails and timber sleepers.  Heritage listing  Imbil Railway Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Imbil Railway bridge, opened in 1915 as a major engineering work on the Mary Valley Branch Railway Line, is important in demonstrating the Queensland Government's policy of establishing branch railway lines to promote closer settlement. Establishment of this branch railway accelerated the settlement of the Mary Valley for agricultural purposes and contributed to the production that made the Wide Bay Burnett district a major agricultural region of Queensland during the first half of the 20th century. The bridge is highly intact and provides physical evidence of early 20th century railway bridge design and construction in Queensland. The Imbil Railway Bridge illustrates the evolution in the principal characteristics of steel railway bridges around the turn of the century, especially the change to the through and half-through Pratt trusses from 1908, which increased the structural strength of rail bridges. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Imbil Railway Bridge is a form of railway bridge that has always been uncommon. It is one of 11 half-through Pratt truss bridges that were built by the Queensland Department of Railways and Public Works during the first three decades of the 20th century. Of these only six remain. The structure is intact and retains a high level of integrity. Other intact railway bridges of this type that are extant are: Harlin Rail Bridge, Harlin (1912) (Harlin Rail Bridge); Sleeper Log Creek (1915); Saltwater Creek (1915); Crystal Creek (1916) and Murray Creek, North Coast line (1923). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Imbil Railway Bridge is a good example of a half- through Pratt truss railway bridge designed by the Department of Railways and Public Works. This bridge type differed subtly from the through Pratt truss in that its girders are not high enough to allow cross bracing at the top of the truss, which is a feature of through Pratt truss bridges. The bridge comprises nine concrete piers, two abutments, five steel eight-panel trusses, rolled steel joists, decking, timber sleepers and steel rails. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. In its setting the Imbil Railway Bridge is picturesque, making a dramatic visual statement and evoking a strong aesthetic response through the juxtaposition of its man-made materials-tall concrete piers and steel trusses-against its natural backdrop of mountains and grassy fields, trees and river. Views that place the bridge in this setting are accessible from road, rail and water.

Tucker Company from 1958 to 1986. He is best known for leading development and revitalization efforts in downtown Indianapolis. In his tenure as the leader of the F.C. Tucker Company, he helped establish the Hilton Indianapolis, Market Square Arena, the OneAmerica Tower, One Indiana Square, Merchants Plaza, and many other projects. He was recognized as \\"Realtor of the Year\\" by the Indianapolis Real Estate Board and the Indiana Real Estate Association in 1967 and served as the president of the National Association of Real Estate Boards (now the National Association of Realtors). Early life and education Tucker was born and grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana. His father, Fred C. Tucker, Sr., founded the F.C. Tucker company the same year that Tucker, Jr. was born (1918). Tucker, Jr. attended DePauw University and graduated in 1940. While in college, he served as the fraternity president of DePauw's Delta Tau Delta chapter. During World War II, Tucker, Jr. served in the United States Navy. The F.C. Tucker Company operated as a sole proprietorship prior to Tucker, Jr. joining his father. Career Tucker began work at the F.C. Tucker Company in 1947. When his father died in 1958, Tucker, Jr. purchased the company with three friends and fellow businessmen: Robert Houk, John A. Wallace, and Edward Joseph \\"Joe\\" Boleman. In the early 1960s, the ownership group devised the \\"Talk to Tucker\\" slogan which appeared on T-shaped yard signs. \\"Talk to Tucker\\" continues to be used by the company into the present day. In 1967, Tucker convinced investors to finance a $3.5-million Hilton hotel project in downtown Indianapolis. The project would eventually lead to the construction of the hotel at Monument Circle in 1971. Tucker also spearheaded development on Merchants Plaza, an area southwest of Monument Circle that contained office space, a new hotel, apartments, a convention center, and an open-air plaza. In the early 1970s Tucker also worked closely with then mayor Richard Lugar on a new arena project for the Indiana Pacers. Tucker oversaw the planning and design of what would become known as Market Square Arena. The arena cost $32 million to build and was funded by the city and other private investors (including the F.C. Tucker Company and the Indiana National Bank). The F.C. Tucker Company had a 30% ownership stake in the Pacers. The arena was completed in 1974. Three years later, the cash-strapped Pacers threatened to relocate if they couldn't come up with 8,000 season ticket holders by the beginning of the season. The F.C. Tucker Company led a \\"Save the Pacers\\" campaign that culminated in a live telethon in order to keep the Pacers in Indianapolis. In 1971, Tucker was elected president of the National Association of Real Estate Boards. He was also the president of the Indianapolis Real Estate Board and the Indiana Real Estate Association. He served as a member of the President's Rent Advisory Board and was also the Chairman of the Depauw University Board of Trustees. In 1974, he was elected president of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Tucker worked at F.C. Tucker into the 1980s. He invested in redevelopment projects like the Canterbury Hotel in 1982. In 1986, he retired as CEO and president of the F.C. Tucker Company. He sold the company to his son, Fred C. Tucker, III, and two other businessman: David Goodrich and current F.C. Tucker president, James Litten. He continued serving as president of Tucker Investment Company, a subsidiary of F.C. Tucker. Tucker died on December 10, 1994. Recognition and awards Tucker was named the 1967 \\"Realtor of the Year\\" by the Indianapolis Real Estate Board and the Indiana Real Estate Association. In 1986, he was honored by the Northwood Institute with an award for outstanding business leaders. The F.C. Tucker Company holds an annual awards ceremony to honor employees. One of the awards is called the \\"Bud Tucker Volunteer of the Year Award\\" in honor of Fred C. \\"Bud\\" Tucker, Jr. Personal life Tucker was married to Ermajean Tucker until his death in 1994.

The policy change is colloquially named after Matt Giteau as the rule was seen as primarily to bring Giteau into the Australian side for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Background Previously, players could only play for the Australian national rugby union team if they played for an Australian team in the Super Rugby competition. Head coach Michael Cheika devised Giteau's Law to enable key overseas players to be eligible for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In April 2015, the Australian Rugby Union announced this new arrangement. The criteria to be selected for the national team under this law are: * Minimum 60 Test caps for Australia; and * Minimum 7 seasons at Super rugby level The rule also allows players to return to Test duty immediately if they have signed with a Super Rugby club for the following two years. Effect Assistant national coach Stephen Larkham said the rule enabled the Australian world cup squad to benefit from more experienced players. He said \\"\\"It‚Äôs not just a team that‚Äôs a little bit older and therefore more experienced (but) we‚Äôve got the right number of experienced guys, the right number of older guys and the right number of younger enthusiastic guys.\\" The New Zealand Rugby Union Chief Executive Steve Tew said he would not implement such a rule as New Zealand \\"didn‚Äôt often follow Australia\\". Besides Giteau, Drew Mitchell returned from France for the 2015 World Cup under this rule.

Etymology The name of the place was derived after the many \\"Camagong\\" trees that grew before in the place. History In the early days, the place was a sugar cane plantation. There were two sugar mills built here as the evidence of stone ruins were still seen until the 1950s. Also, one of the three cemeteries of the town was found here at Sitio Balinghayo, a parcel of land donated by the late Claro Pena, Sr. and was intended for those who died non-Christians or Protestants during the Spanish time. The same cemetery was also used for the burial of unbaptized babies and those whose relatives could not afford to pay the burial fees for the dead. Today, the cemetery is being used also as the graveyard even for Catholics. According to old folks, there were trenches that were built in the place stretching towards its neighbor barangay San Rafael, Lagonoy accordingly for the use of Filipino soldiers known before as \\"insurectos\\" (insurgents) who are spying the arrivals of the Americans. They were using poles made into tubes in order to see the activities of their enemies. However, due to passage of time, the traces of these trenches can no longer be seen today.

Sergei Ryzhkov is the current head of the Directorate.  History  On September 15, 1987, an agreement between the USA and USSR was signed for the establishment of National Centers for nuclear risk reduction in Moscow and Washington. Thus, On December 14, 1987 the Government of the Soviet Union established the NTsUYaO (–ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –ø–æ —É–º–µ–Ω—å—à–µ–Ω–∏—é —è–¥–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ ,–ù–¶–£–Ø–û) National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center which was subordinate under the Soviet Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union. From its establishment the center has been tasked with informing the government about launches of missiles, but soon its tasks increased due to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the United States about the removal and elimination of intermediate and short range missiles, from December 8, 1987. Shortly, after that the center become the primary body responsible for control and inspection of nuclear and strategic weapons in Soviet Union. Since February 24, 1988 the center has been active full time, and since April 1 in the same year, a hotline between the center and its US counterpart, the Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, was established. Its purpose was to create an additional channel of communication for the prevention of nuclear war, in addition to the Hot Line and diplomatic channels. The Center is online 24 hours a day and relays information regarding the arms activities of both nations so as to prevent accidental outbreak of nuclear war. The Center is taking part in open skies agreements. The Treaty on Open Skies establishes a program of unarmed aerial surveillance flights over the entire territory of its participants. It was signed in March 1992 and became one of the major confidence-building measures in Europe after the Cold War. It entered into force on January 1, 2002, and currently has 34 States Parties, including Russia and the majority of the NATO countries. Moscow ratified the Treaty on Open Skies on May 26, 2001. The treaty allows its participants to openly gather information on each other's military forces and activities.

Footballs are often made of cow hide leather, as such a material is required in professional and collegiate football. Footballs used in recreation, and in organized youth leagues, may be made of rubber or plastic materials (high school football rule books still allow inexpensive all-rubber footballs, though they are less common than leather). History =Early balls= Richard Lindon with two rugby union balls in 1880 In the 1860s, manufactured inflatable balls were introduced through the innovations of English shoemaker Richard Lindon. These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying easier. These early footballs were plum-shaped. Some teams used to have white footballs for purposes of night practice. Georgia Tech back Judy Harlan once spoke of Joe Guyon, a full blooded Indian, and his antics: \\"Once in a while the Indian would come out in Joe, such as the nights (John) Heisman gave us a white football and had us working out under the lights. That's when Guyon would give out the blood curdling war whoops.\\" A white football signed by the members of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star Team, including president Gerald Ford The football changed in 1934, with a rule change that tapered the ball at the ends more and reduced the size around the middle. This new, sleeker ball made it much easier to handle, particularly for passers, while at the same time making the drop kick unreliable and obsolete. Hugh \\"Shorty\\" Ray, at the time a college football official and later the NFL's head of officiating, is generally credited with conceiving the pointed football. =\\"The Duke\\"= From 1941 to 1970 and since 2006, the official game ball of the National Football League has been stamped with the nickname \\"The Duke\\" in honor of Wellington Mara, the longtime owner of the New York Giants, who was named after the Duke of Wellington by his father, Tim Mara, founder and first owner of the Giants. Wilson Sporting Goods, the manufacturer of the NFL ball since 1941, named the ball after Wellington Mara at the urging of George Halas, the owner of the Chicago Bears, to reward Tim Mara for arranging the contract that made Wilson the official supplier of footballs to the NFL. The nickname was originally used until 1970, when Wilson changed the game ball upon the merger of the NFL and AFL. Wellington Mara died in 2005, and Wilson returned \\"The Duke\\" to the game ball the following year in his honor. Properties Early American footballs were essentially rugby balls, later redesigned to make them easier to throw. In this 1907 photo, Bradbury Robinson, who threw the first legal forward pass, demonstrates an \\"Overhand spiral‚Äîfingers on lacing\\"Cochems, Eddie, \\"The Forward Pass and On-Side Kick\\", Spalding's How to Play Foot Ball, American Sports Publishing, Walter Camp, Editor, Revised 1907 edition Coach John Heisman (the namesake for today's Heisman Trophy) was a Shakespearean actor in the offseason, and would open each season by saying to his freshmen football players: Leather panels are typically tanned to a natural brown color, which is usually required in professional leagues and collegiate play. At least one manufacturer uses leather that has been tanned to provide a \\"tacky\\" grip in dry or wet conditions. Historically, white footballs have been used in games played at night so that the ball can be seen more easily; however, improved artificial lighting conditions have made this no longer necessary. At most levels of play (but not, notably, the NFL), white stripes are painted on each end of the ball, halfway around the circumference, to improve nighttime visibility and also to differentiate the college football from the pro football. However, the NFL once explored the usage of white-striped footballs ‚Äì in Super Bowl VIII. The leather is usually stamped with a pebble-grain texture to help players grip the ball. Some or all of the panels may be stamped with the manufacturer's name, league or conference logos, signatures, and other markings. Four panels or pieces of leather or plastic are required for each football. After a series of quality control inspections for weight and blemishes, workers begin the actual manufacturing process. Two of the panels are perforated along adjoining edges, so that they can be laced together. One of these lacing panels receives an additional perforation and reinforcements in its center, to hold the inflation valve. Each panel is attached to an interior lining. The four panels are then stitched together in an \\"inside-out\\" manner. The edges with the lacing holes, however, are not stitched together. The ball is then turned right side out by pushing the panels through the lacing hole. A polyurethane or rubber lining called a bladder is then inserted through the lacing hole. Polyvinyl chloride or leather laces are inserted through the perforations, to provide a grip for holding, hiking and passing the football. Before play, according to the NFL rules, the ball must be inflated to an air pressure between . The ball weighs . =Other leagues= In the CFL the stripes traverse the entire circumference of the ball; its ball used slightly different dimensions prior to the 2018 season, when the league adopted the NFL specifications for its ball with the previous striping retained.CFL TO ROLL OUT NEW BALL FOR 2018 SEASON The UFL used a ball with lime-green stripes. The 2001 XFL used a novel color pattern, a black ball with red curved lines in lieu of stripes, for its footballs; this design was redone in a tan and navy color scheme for the Arena Football League in 2003. The 2020 XFL is standard brown but with X markings at each point. Three indoor American football leagues; the Can-Am League, UIFL, and AIF, used a ball with red, white and blue panels. The USFL (1983‚Äì85) used the same Wilson football the NFL used at the time, with the only differences being the word markings and signature. The World Football League's football was a distinct orange color, said to be more visible during the night as most of that league's games would be played in the evenings. Regulations Typical modern American football as used in the NFL, manufactured by Wilson In an NFL game, the home club must have 36 balls for an outdoor game or 24 for an indoor game, and they must be available for the referee to test with a pressure gauge two and a half hours before the game. Twelve new footballs, sealed in a special box and shipped by the manufacturer, are opened in the officials‚Äô locker room two hours and 15 minutes before the game. These balls are specially marked with the letter \\"K\\" and are used exclusively for the kicking game. The visiting team may also present 12 balls to the referee for outdoor games for inspection. Since 1941, Horween Leather Company has been the exclusive supplier of leather for National Football League footballs. The arrangement was established by Arnold Horween, who had played and coached in the NFL. Horween Leather Company also supplies leather to Spalding, supplier of balls to the Arena Football League. Despite the moniker \\"pigskin\\" sometimes used to refer to footballs, cow leather is used. Recreational variations Minnesota Vikings kicker Fred Cox, during his NFL career, is credited with developing an all-polyurethane foam football, which he sold to Nerf.

It was designed by Queensland Railways and built by Queensland Railways. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2011.  History  The Mary Valley branch railway cream sheds, located at Amamoor, Kandanga and Melawondi, were built between the 1920s and 1940s by Queensland Railways, in response to the strong growth of dairying in one of Queensland's most important dairy producing regions and the reliance on rail to transport dairy produce during this period. The gradual opening of large pastoral holdings of Amamoor, Imbil and Traveston (established 1850s) in the Upper Mary River Valley for closer settlement from the late 1870s was a catalyst for the development of small cropping and dairying activities in the region. The changing patterns of land use and settlement in the Mary Valley occurred while nearby Gympie evolved from its beginnings as a makeshift settlement and alluvial field in late 1867 into an important regional town and major deep reef gold producer by the 1880s. The town provided a ready market for the growing number of agricultural producers in the surrounding district. In the Mary Valley, maize and potatoes were the dominant early crops, although experimental plantings of tobacco, rice, sugar cane, peas and pineapples were also undertaken. From the late 1800s, a number of critical factors aided the expansion of the dairy industry into one of Queensland's principal primary industries by the interwar period. These included: the introduction of mechanical cream separators in the 1880s; Babcock testing to accurately measure cream content in milk; The Meat and Dairy Encouragement Act 1893 which made provision for government loans to construct butter and cheese factories; and the Department of Agriculture and Stock's use of a \\"Travelling Dairy\\" to demonstrate techniques and equipment to potential dairy farmers throughout Queensland. The introduction of pastures such as paspalum and Rhodes grass and the increased cultivation of fodder also occurred, to improve milk yields and to provide adequate feed during the less productive months of winter. Hugo Du Rietz, a Swedish born architect, made an important contribution to the development of the dairy industry in the Gympie district by his introduction of the first mechanical cream separator into Queensland in 1882. The Queensland government's travelling dairy visited Lagoon Pocket, in the Mary Valley, in September 1890. By 1894 there were 120 dairies in the Gympie Land Agent's district, although most production was milk for town supply. In the Mary Valley, Frank Chippindall was transporting butter produced by local settlers into Gympie around 1885‚Äì1886, as was Peter Meyers in 1893. By the early 1900s co-operatives were becoming the dominant form of ownership of cheese and butter factories, a pattern that defined the Queensland dairy industry for much of the 20th century. In 1897, Gympie's first dairy co- operative for butter production, the Gympie Central Dairying Company was established. By 1897 the Silverwood Dairying Company had taken over the factory and in 1906 the Wide Bay Co-Operative purchased the operations. In the year ending 30 June 1907 there were 322 suppliers to the Wide Bay Company, who were paid a total of for their cream. Metal cans containing the cream produced by dairy farms surrounding Gympie was carted into the Wide Bay Co-operative's factory by contractors. In the Mary Valley, some cream was also sent from the Traveston railway station on the North Coast railway line to butter factories further south. At the beginning of the twentieth century the Queensland government was promoting the construction of branch railways in rural areas to assist growth in population and agricultural production. In the 1880s a Mary Valley route had been among the proposals for the line from Brisbane to Gympie, but was rejected. Local agitation for a Mary Valley branch railway (with varying proposals for the route's alignment) increased during the 1900s. The Railway Commissioner investigated and surveyed a proposed line for the Mary Valley in 1910, with the accompanying report contending \\"considerable traffic in agricultural produce, timber, livestock and dairy products\\" would eventuate. Subsequently, a route deviating from the North Coast line at Monkland (south of Gympie) and extending to Brooloo was approved, a decision aided by the availability of timber for freight and construction, and Gympie City Council's offer to fund one third of construction costs. Work commenced in June 1911 and by 1913, 550 men were working on the project. The line reached Kandanga in February 1914 and the terminus of Brooloo in April 1915, the month the whole line was officially opened for passenger and goods traffic. Along the line, subdivisions of a number of larger holdings into farm and town allotments near rail stops increased the availability agricultural land for settlers and led to the establishment of small townships at Kandanga (1912), Brooloo, Imbil and Amamoor (1914) and Dagun (1917). While timber freight was initially the main income generator for the Mary Valley Railway, cream was transported on the line from its very beginnings. Transportation by rail was a far more efficient way of delivering cream to butter factories, with contractors and individual farmers able to deliver their cream direct to the nearest railhead. Following delivery and washing of the cans at the factory, they were returned by rail, with each can inscribed with the name of its owner for identification. In its first four weeks of operations following the opening of its station in 1914, two tons of cream was sent from Kandanga. After the disruption of World War I, dairying and agricultural activity increased rapidly, with a corresponding increase in the transportation of produce on the railway. In 1921 there were 93 dairies located between Dagun and Brooloo, milking 2,900 cows (an average herd size of 31) and producing of cream. In October of that year, a combined total of around 350 cans were sent from Kandanga and Imbil railway stations each week. In January 1922, of cream, equal to around of butter, was sent to the Wide Bay Co-operative Factory at Gympie from suppliers between Brooloo and Amamoor. The expansion of dairy production during the early twentieth century led to the construction of cream sheds by Queensland Railways at stations and sidings throughout the state. Cream sheds were built to a standard design; measuring , clad and lined with horizontal hardwood boards separated by open spaces, with the interior boards offset to cover the outside spaces. The spacing of the boards improved air circulation, resulting in a cooler storage space, reducing the risk of the cream spoiling before reaching the butter factory. Double doors opened out to platforms on either side of the shed for placement and retrieval of cream cans. Sheds were set on low stumps and were sheltered by a gabled roof. By 1921, the heavy handling needed to load cream cans and their exposure to heat at Kandanga station was noted. The Railway Commissioner's inspection of the Mary Valley Railway in late 1924, noted the ongoing increase in \\"cream traffic\\" along the line and the arduous work involved for guards who were lifting the cans from platforms on rail level. The Commissioner agreed to cream sheds being provided at Amamoor and Dagun stations and Lagoon Pocket siding. The construction of the cream shed at Amamoor as well as a shed at Imbil was approved in February 1925 at a cost of and respectively. The following month the cream shed at the Lagoon Pocket siding was approved at a cost of . A shed at Dawn siding was built sometime after this date and a shed at Melawondi was built in 1946. The provision of cream sheds along the length of the line demonstrated the extent and expansion of dairying in the Mary Valley. Cream supply was generally at its highest during the wetter summer months and this was when cream sheds were most heavily used. The lower output that occurred during winter is reflected in the returns for the week ending 24 August 1931, when 207 cream cans were forwarded to Gympie and 11 cans were sent to Pomona from Kandanga, Imbil, Amamoor and Dagun. The Mary River was subject to serious flooding during the wet season and the railway crossing near the Dawn often became impassable. The importance of cream freight was evident on these occasions, with a special train organised to pick up cans from the cream sheds until it reached the river crossing, from where the Wide Bay Co-op boat would ferry the supplies over the river. The interwar period saw the dairy industry expand greatly in Queensland. Between 1927 and 1937 the total number of dairy cattle rose by 50 per cent. Dairying was geographically Queensland's most widespread agricultural industry in the 1930s and the state's second most profitable export industry from 1936 to 1941, accounting for 20 per cent of primary production. By the late 1930s, around one in eight Queenslanders were living on dairy farms. The rapid increase in production in the Mary Valley during the interwar period made a significant contribution to the Gympie region's status as one of Queensland's top dairy producing areas. In response to increased cream supply outgrowing production capacity, the Wide Bay Co-Operative built what was claimed as Australia's largest butter factory in 1925, and was receiving cream from 2,000 suppliers by 1935. By 1927 the Gympie district was responsible for 10 per cent of Queensland's milk production, the majority of which was used for butter making. In 1937 the Petty Sessions District of Gympie was Queensland's largest milk and butter producer, with the greatest number of dairy cattle in milk. By 1939 the 12 butter factories in the Wide Bay-Burnett region (not including Cooroy), produced almost a third of Queensland's butter. In the same year, 4,500 cream cans were forwarded from Kandanga alone. In 1952 the Gympie district produced 15 per cent of Queensland's butter, and 1953 was the Wide Bay Co-Operative's record year for payment to its suppliers. However, a downturn began in the 1950s, which reflected changes occurring across the industry in Queensland. Butter consumption per capita in Australia dropped from to between 1957 and 1972, and a major butter market was lost when Britain joined the European Economic Community in the early 1970s. The transition towards the production of milk rather than cream, requiring larger herds and new equipment, saw many smaller scale farmers leaving the industry or switching to beef cattle. Tougher regulations for the running of dairies, lower prices, foreign imports and competition from margarine producers all took their toll. Between 1973 and 1976, 28 per cent of the Wide Bay Co-op's farmers left the industry. As milk production increased, farm storage in vats and road transportation by tankers became the norm. The last delivery of dairy produce to Wide Bay Co-op's Gympie factory in a can (from Miva, west of Gympie) occurred in 1973 and the last butter was churned in May 1978, ending nearly 80 years of production at the site. The decline of cream production and the realignment of transport arrangements for dairy producers saw the removal of some cream sheds on the Mary Valley railway, while those that remained were used for storage. The cream shed at Lagoon Pocket was removed in 1965 and at Dawn in 1968. In 1963 Dagun's cream shed was incorporated into the north corner of the goods sheds (erected 1938). At least one other example of a combined goods and cream shed is known to have been built in Queensland ‚Äì at The Summit (near Stanthorpe). While fruit freight (predominantly pineapples) continued to be transported on the Mary Valley railway following the demise of cream production, the line became increasingly unprofitable during the 1970s. By the late 1980s, the future of the line was increasingly precarious. In 1988 station masters/mistresses were removed from Imbil, Amamoor and Dagun and a number of railway buildings such as goods sheds, waiting sheds and residences were sold for removal. Queensland Railways opted to retain the cream sheds at Kandanga, Amamoor, Melawondi Dagun and Imbil (later removed) for storage purposes. The reduction of infrastructure and services on the railway made it increasingly apparent that the line was to close. Strong protests by the district's pineapple growers helped to delay any final decision on the line's future. The last goods train ran to Kandanga in 1995 and thereafter pineapple growers took their produce to Traveston station on the Brisbane-Gympie North line. The line however, was not formally closed and in 1996 the Mary Valley Heritage Railway Board negotiated to conduct tourist train services on the line. The Mary Valley Heritage Railway commenced operations on the former Mary Valley branch on 23 May 1998. The \\"Valley Rattler\\" steam train tours and rail motor rides have since become a major tourist attraction for the region. A large group of volunteers and trainees contribute to the operation and maintenance of the line, rolling stock and buildings between the (former) Gympie Railway Station and Imbil. The cream sheds at Melawondi, Kandanga and Amamoor remain as evidence of the growth and economic importance of the dairy industry to the Mary Valley during the twentieth century.

Heritage listing  Mary Valley Railway Cream Sheds was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mary Valley railway cream sheds are important in demonstrating the growth of the dairy industry in the Wide Bay-Burnett, one of Queensland's most important dairy producing regions during the twentieth century. The construction of the branch railway (1911‚Äì1915) and the associated increase in closer settlement in the Mary Valley was a catalyst for the expansion of dairying in the district. The provision of cream sheds along the length of the line during the 1920s to 1940s demonstrates the extent of this expansion. More widely, the cream sheds illustrate the historical importance and role of railways in transporting dairy produce in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The highly intact Amamoor, Kandanga and Melawondi cream sheds demonstrate the principal characteristics of railway cream sheds built alongside Queensland railway lines to facilitate the transport of dairy produce during the twentieth century. Located adjacent to the railway line in station yards and built to a standard design, the small square sheds are clad and lined with horizontal hardwood boards separated by open spaces on both the interior and exterior, with those on the interior offset to cover the spaces on the exterior. The boards are spaced to improve air circulation, resulting in a cooler internal storage area. The sheds stand on low stumps, are sheltered by gabled roofs and have double doors that open out to platforms on either side of the shed for placement and retrieval of cream cans.

Background In early 1947, the Peloponnese peninsula was relatively peaceful, but fighting eventually occurred in late 1947. Throughout 1948, communist control of the interior of the peninsula made the central and southern regions inaccessible to government. The communists provided good treatment to the local inhabitants in areas they controlled, and the region suffered less than other parts of Greece. Campaign The location of the Peloponnese isolated the communists there from their comrades in northern and central Greece. During the course of the campaign, the communist leadership (operating in northern Greece) suffered a split between those loyal to Markos Vafiadis and the pro-Soviet faction of KKE General-Secretary Nikos Zachariadis, as a result of the Tito‚ÄìStalin split. At the same time, relations between the Greek communists and Tito's Yugoslavia were beginning to break down. Bibliography *Studies in the History of the Greek Civil War, 1945‚Äì1949.

Life  = Late Qing Era = Lu Rongting came from a peasant family and joined secret societies during his youth in order to make a living. He became a regular in the Qing army after the outbreak of the Sino-French War in 1884. Between 1903-05 he actively participated in the suppression of revolutionaries in Guangxi. In the fall of 1904 Viceroy of Liangguang Cen Chunxuan appointed him commander of the 4000-man Guangxi Border Guards unit. This army would later form the core of the Old Guangxi clique. In December 1907 Long Jiguang and Lu Rongting led Qing forces in suppressing the Zhennanguan Uprising. The successful suppression of the revolt led by Sun Yat- sen and Huang Xing consequently forced Sun to flee to Singapore, and he did not return to China until the Wuchang Uprising. The Qing court awarded Lu with the Baturu title. With Long Jiguang leaving for the position of Viceroy of Guangdong, Lu was promoted to become the Viceroy of Guangxi. = Leader of the Old Guangxi Clique = In July 1911, following the Wuchang Uprising, Guangxi Gov. Chen Bingkun proclaimed independence and formed the Guangxi military government. Following the departure of Shen Bingkun and Wang Zhixiang, Lu assumed control over Guangxi province. On 8 February 1912 Yuan Shikai formally appointed Lu the governor of Guangxi. In the GMD-initiated \\"second revolution\\" in 1913, Lu sided with Yuan Shikai and suppressed the Nationalist revolutionaries in Guangxi. Soon afterwards Cai E and Tang Jiyao (Yunnan Clique) started the National Protection War and Lu joined them against Yuan's monarchial ambitions. In the process Cen Chunxuan, an enemy of Yuan Shikai, was secretly recruited by Lu. Some scholars have suggested the reason for Lu's sudden change in allegiance was due to his discontent about Yuan's preferential treatment, which prevented him from expanding his influence into Guangdong.ÈªÑÂÆóÁÇé„ÄåÈôÜËç£Âª∑„ÄçË∞¢Êú¨‰π¶‰∏ªÁºñ„ÄéË•øÂçóÂçÅÂÜõÈòÄ„Äè‰∏äÊµ∑‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ„ÄÅ1993Âπ¥„ÄÅ53-55È°µ„ÄÇ Nevertheless, the National Protection War led to the abdication of Yuan Shikai. Long Jiguang proclaimed Guangdong's independence from Yuan on 6 April 1916. With the death of Yuan Shikai in June, Lu and Li Liejun attacked Long and forced him to retreat to Hainan. In the same year Lu assumed the position of governor of Guangdong province. His control and jurisdiction over both Guangdong and Guangxi was affirmed by Li Yuanhong in April 1917. = Start of the Warlord Era = Lu's gift to RFC Hedgeland, dated 19 October 1919. Caption reads: ‚ÄúLu Jung-T'ing, Governor General and Commander in Chief of Guangdong and Guangxi, Canton‚Äù. Sun Yat-sen initiated the Constitutional Protection Movement in 1917, and Lu played an important role. Under the military reorganization in 1918, Tang Jihao and Lu were appointed joint chiefs. This organization was instrumental in establishing peace between the Beijing government (under the Zhili Clique) and the Constitutional Protection Movement armies. However, schisms within the movement appeared, with Sun opposing Lu's (Old Guangxi Clique) nuanced stance against the Zhili Clique-led government in Beijing. Furthermore, the people of Guangdong gradually became opposed to Lu's control over the province. By July 1920 Chen Jiongming (with Sun's support) ousted Lu and Cen Chunxuan from Guangdong. = Military Comeback = After Lu's loss in Guangdong, he gained the support of the Beiyang government in an attempt to recover the province. In June 1921, the second conflict between the Old Guangxi Clique and Guangdong took place. However, due to defections within his own army and the loss of the strategic city of Chongzuo in September, Lu declared his decision to step down from the governorship in Nanning, and he subsequently fled to Shanghai. Due to the polarization of relations between Chen Jiongming and Sun Yat-sen, Lu was re-appointed to become governor of Guangxi province in 1923 by the Beiyang government. However, he was unable to fully recover his influence over the province due to the formation of the New Guangxi Clique led by Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. Within Southern China three forces emerged, the most powerful led by the coalition of Lu and followed by Shen Hongying and the New Guangxi Clique. In 1924 Lu's forces were surrounded by Shen's troops and at the same time were under attack by the New Guangxi Clique. Nanning was lost to the New Guangxi Clique and by August that year Lu had also lost Guilin to Shen.

The album edition of the project was released by Ash International as a vinyl record in January 2016.http://www.ashinternational.com/editions/ash_112_ande_somby_yoiking_with_the_winged_ones.html Yoiking with the Winged Ones is also presented as an art installation.

The project is performed and produced by √Ånde Somby, an artist deeply rooted in the yoik tradition. In this project, Somby contributes to the tradition of yoik with pretty epressive style of yoiking. The title references to 3 inspirations. The first is the traditional story that the underground fairies (gufihttarat) were the ones that taught the S√°mi people to yoik. The second inspiration is the Norwegian song Nisser og Dverge. That song is according to Somby the start of Norways war against their own fairies and elf and thereby the earth that has a soul. The third inspiration is the myth about Narcissus and Echo. Reception The LP Yoiking with the Winged Ones has been reviewed in Somby's native language S√°mi as well as in Danish and Norwegian. The album is reviewed also in Italian, German, French, Dutch, Japanese, and English. According to PassiveAggressive, he is almost on the border of the human voice. Somby's yoiking has been described as having the energy that punk rock had before it was tamed in the music studios, with Klassekampen comparing Somby's work to that of the English punk band Cockney Rejects. Track listing In yoiks, there can sometimes be epic lyrics containing long narratives. Other times, there can be poetic texts. There can also be no lyrics at all. In this project, there are no lyrics. Production Sound recording at a lake whose echo features in Yoiking with the Winged Ones The recordings and post production were by Chris Watson, a sound artist and sound recordist from Newcastle upon Tyne. The sampling of sounds took place in Kvalnes, Lofoten in June 2014.

In the southwest, the hill of Kleftis changed hands repeatedly. With heavier casualties against a numerically superior opponent, the communists had their wounded and artillery moved across the border to the People's Republic of Albania, while the remaining 8,000 retreated to Mount Vitsi. Aftermath Although the Hellenic Army failed to completely defeat the communists, the latter realized the lack of assistance they received from the Soviet Union, while the royalist government became stronger with assistance from the United States (Truman Doctrine). During the campaign, the Tito‚ÄìStalin Split developed between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union which would eventually split the Greek communists into separate factions.

Plum Memorial Library is a public library in Lombard, Illinois.  History  Josiah Reade established the first public library in Lombard at the First Church of Lombard in 1905. The Helen Plum Library and Lilacia Park were founded in 1927, according to the will of the late Colonel William R. Plum. Josiah Reade's collection was moved to the new library. The library was originally located in Plum's house, but moved to its current location in 1963. In 2003, the library received a $360,000 donation for books, equipment, and the establishment of a scholarship fund. In 2013, the library was given the Muslim Journeys Bookshelf by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Library Association. This project aims to educate the public about the culture and history of Muslims in the United States. Barbara Kruser, the current director of the library, aims to increase programming and raise funding for a new building for the library. In late 2015, the Board of Trustees began meeting to decide whether to expand or replace the current building. In March 2016, the library decided to keep the library at the current location. In November 2016, voters approved a referendum for the library to borrow $22.3 million to replace the library's current building. In 2020, the library announced its intent to develop a former grocery store property in Lombard.  References   External links  * * Helen M.

In its heyday it was home to over 1,200 miners and other residents. Today the town is deserted; however, it still attracts many four-wheel-drive and mining enthusiasts. History Donnelly's Creek was named after John Donnelly, the leader of a party of miners who discovered gold there in August 1862. The other members of his group included Soloman Chalmers and a miner by the name of De Crocket. Donnelly and De Crocket left the creek to register the claim in Sale. In the meantime, Chalmers went back to the gold-mining town of Jericho to obtain tools and supplies. On Chalmers' return he was followed by four miners who jumped half of the Donnelly group's claim. Despite appeals to the authorities, they were unsuccessful in regaining control of the ground because of legal technicalities. In the meantime the publicity attracted more miners to the area, who quickly pegged out the entire creek.Gippsland Times 22 August 1862 The claims returned an average of one ounce per man per claim per day. (In 1866 Donnelly and his two mates finally received a reward of ¬£650 from the Victorian Government Gold Reward Board for the discovery.) By the end of 1862 the source of the alluvial gold found in the creek had been uncovered. Four reefs were found, the most prominent of these was named Edwards' Reef, after George Edwards. Mining continued in the area until 1911, when the last mine ‚Äì the White Star ‚Äì closed. By 1922 the region had been all but forgotten; however, it was worked by scattered individual prospectors up until the outbreak of World War 2. Since then, the area has been mostly used for outdoor recreation: four-wheel driving, fishing, and camping. In February 2013, fires destroyed four shelter huts in the area from Donnelly's Creek to Aberfeldy. Mining The four main reefs found at Donnelly's Creek were * Edwards' Reef, which returned 5,877 oz. of gold from 8,151 tons of quartz * Crinoline Reef, which yielded 4,938 oz. from 9,893 tons * White Star Reef, which produced 2,801 oz. from 6,854 tons * Bismark (United Star) Beef, which crushed 7,424 tons for 11,488 oz. of gold There were a number of other, smaller mining operations in the district, including the Hit or Miss, Boy's Reef (discovered by a nine-year-old boy, James Frederick Porter), the Nil Desperandum and Watson's Reward.

It has linear, grey- green or green broad leaves, tall stem with 2‚Äì3 branches, holding up to 9 scented flowers, in shades of violet, purple, lavender blue and light blue, with a yellow and white or orange and white beard. It is listed as a synonym of Iris germanica in some sources. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, including being planted in graveyards and cemeteries. Description It is often confused with Iris trojana (now classed as a synonym of Iris germanica) and Iris cypriana. It is also similar in form to Iris cypriana but outer bract (spathe) is brown and papery in the upper third only.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) It is a geophyte, that has thick rhizomes, which are stoloniferous, and semi-buried in the ground. It has linear, green,British Iris Society (1997) or grey-green, glaucous leaves. The sheathing leaves, can grow up to between long, and 5 cm wide. The leaves are wider than Iris cypriana. It has a tall stem, or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall.Kelly Norris It has 2 or 3 branched stems. The stem has broad, spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are green in the lower half, and (scarious) membranous or brown and papery, in the upper third of the leaf. The stems (and the branches) hold between 3 and 8, or 9 flowers. Each stem carries 2‚Äì3 flowers, at the terminal end of each branch, there is always a single flower per stem. It blooms early in the season, between late spring and early summer, between May, and June. The large flowers, are scented, and come in shades of violet, purple, lavender blue (similar in shade to Iris junonia), and light blue. There are occasionally bi- toned flowers. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate or cuneate (wedge shaped), with a white haft (section closest to the stem), that has bronzy purple veins, or lines. In the centre of the fall, is a row of hairs called a beard, which are yellow, or orange yellow, at the base, turning white at the front of the petal. The standards are obovate or unguiculate (claw shaped), they are paler than the falls, and have a pale haft that is also marked with bronzy-purple. It has a long perianth tube, which is wider and shorter than the perianth tube of Iris cypriana. It has a rounded ovary, blue-purple style arms, violet crests, white filaments and cream anther. After the iris has flowered, it produces an oblong or trigonal seed capsule, that is long. Inside the capsule, are large, pyriform (pear-shaped), brown wrinkled seeds. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. Iris mesopotamica is a tetraploid iris, which have developed from an autoploid.J. Schulz-Schaeffer It was counted by Sturtevant and Randolph, in 1945, as 2n=45. Taxonomy It is commonly known as 'Mesopotamian Iris',Efraim Lev and Zohar Amar or 'aram naharayim Iris', which is the old Hebrew word for Mesopotamia. It is sometimes called 'Mardin Iris', which is also a common name for Iris germanica.Elaine Nowick It is known in Hebrew as ◊ê÷¥◊ô◊®◊ï÷º◊° ◊ê÷≤◊®÷∑◊ù-◊†÷∑◊î÷≤◊®÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù It is written in Arabic as ÿ£ŸÑŸÑŸëÿ∫ÿ© ÿ¢ŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®ŸäŸëÿ© ÿ≥Ÿàÿ≥ŸÜ ÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇŸä The Latin specific epithet mesopotamica refers to the former region of Mesopotamia, which equates to the current countries of Iraq, Syria and Kuwait. In the 1800s, Mr Michael Foster was sent several rhizomes of wild plants collected in Turkey, and the eastern part of the Mediterranean. These included Iris cypriana Foster & Baker and Iris trojana A. Kerner ex Stapf. Several iris rhizomes were then sent to Mr Dykes at Charterhouse School (in Surrey), from Mardin in Armenia, by another Charterhouse school teacher. Some were later classified as Iris gatesii and others were then named and described as Iris mesopotamica by Dykes. It was first published and described by William Rickatson Dykes in his book, 'The Genus Iris' (Gen. Iris) page176 in 1913. It was also published in The Gardeners' Chronicle Vol.73 page237 on 21. October 1922 (with an illustration). Later Brian Mathew, then altered Iris germanica to include other tall 48-chromosome tetraploids, including Iris cypriana, Iris mesopotamica, and Iris trojana. Iris kashmiriana and Iris croatica are also connected with this group. Some authors still regard Iris mesopotamica as a form of Iris germanica. But others disagree. It is not completely known whether this is a true natural species of iris or a cultivar. In the iris trade, they are often confused with Iris cypriana and with Iris trojana, (which is commonly listed as a synonym of Iris germanica). It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003 and then updated on 1 March 2007. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, as a synonym of Iris germanica. It is listed as a synonym of Iris germanica by The Plant List. Iris mesopotamica is listed as a synonym by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to Asia, within the Middle East, or the Levant, (eastern Mediterranean,Thomas DeBaggio and Arthur O. Tucker ). =Range= It is found in Turkey (including the region of Hatay Province,), Syria, and Israel (within Mount Hermon, Galilee, and Golan ). It is endemic in Israel. It was originally found in Armenia, and Cyprus, but not any more. Paul Mouterde (French botanist 1892‚Äì1972) stated that wild populations exist in the mountains of north Syria. =Habitat= It grows on dry rocky slopes, grasslands, and on the semi-steppe shrublands. They can be found at an altitude of above above sea level. Conservation It was thought not to be growing wild, apart from in Israel. Populations can be found on Mount Hermon, where it is listed as common, on Mt. Gilboa and Bet Shean Valley, it is listed as V. Rare. These populations are all protected. Cultivation It is hardy, to European Zone H2, meaning Hardy to ‚àí15 to ‚àí20 ¬∞C (5 to ‚àí4 ¬∞F). or RHS Hardiness Rating H5 (‚àí15 to ‚àí10 ¬∞C (5‚Äì14 ¬∞F)). It prefers well drained soils, but can tolerate heavy soils. It prefers positions in full sun. The rhizomes can be susceptible to 'iris root rot', also the leaves may also be affected by leaf spot (heterosporium gracile). The leaves can also be eaten by slugs and snails. Dykes recommends a planting time of between August and September. It can be found for sale in some specialised nurseries, in Europe. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. It sometimes produces tall seedlings with tall widely branching stems, that are sometimes too weak to hold up the flower.US Department of Agriculture =Hybrids and cultivars= Michael Foster was the first to use the species in hybridisation. He crossed with Iris germanica to create larger plants. Then in the early 20th century, William Mohr, and Sydney B Mitchell (from California) used the iris in breeding programmes of tall bearded varieties. The first tetraploid forms appeared in 1900, by 1943 there were up to 145 diploid, 23 triploid and 247 tetraploid cultivars.A. Vainstein (Editor) Known Iris mesopotamica cultivars include Iris 'Ricardi' and Iris 'Ricardi Alba'. Known Iris mesopotamica crosses include; Iris lutescens X Iris mesopotamica ‚Äì 'Autumn Gleam' Iris mesopotamica X Iris germanica ‚Äì 'Eglamour', 'Father Time' and 'Mme. Claude Monet' Iris mesopotamica X Iris pallida ‚Äì 'Andree Autissier', 'Blanc Bleute', 'Carthusian', 'Mlle. Jeanne Bel' and 'Mlle. Schwartz' Iris iberica X Iris mesopotamica- 'Ib-Ric'. Cultivar 'Purissima' (Stern 1946) comes from Iris cypriana x Iris pallida and Iris 'Juniata' x Iris mesopotamica Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Uses Iris mesopotamica has been used in the past in folk medicine, for various uses including; treating animals bites and poisons, treating Haemorrhoids and sexual diseases, treating Internal diseases, treating inflammations and skin diseases. The rhizomes also contain a plenty of starch, including isoflavone and essential oils which are used in perfumery, similar to Iris florentina. Culture In the past, up to hundreds of years ago, in the Levant, Arabs, and Muslims, planted Iris albicans, (another white flowering bearded iris) and Iris mesopotamica in cemeteries, and graveyards, beside the graves, as an ornamental. Including in Israel, Palestine, North Africa and Syria (since the 16th century). Some graveyards and cemeteries were later abandoned, allowing the iris to become naturalised in some sites.

History  After a fire in 1800 that destroyed a previous opera house, also located on Place Broglie, the Strasbourg municipality set up plans for a new one in 1804. As the Napoleonic Empire came and went, the plans for the th√©√¢tre municipal were altered several times, until the building, designed in the Neoclassical style by architect Jean-Nicolas Villot (1782‚Äì1857) finally opened to great acclaim in 1821. The monumental fa√ßade is adorned by sandstone statues of six muses by Landolin Ohmacht (three muses were left out: Clio, Thalia and Urania), each statue corresponding to a column below. During the Siege of Strasbourg in 1870, the opera was heavily damaged by Prussian artillery. It was faithfully rebuilt by the architect , who also rebuilt the H√¥tel de Klinglin nearby, and reopened in 1873. In 1888, a semi-circular wing was added at the rear by Johann-Karl Ott (1846‚Äì1917). The auditorium has 1,142 seats and a height of from the floor to the ceiling.

He was doctor for the Scotland national football team for 228 full international matches, part of his involvement with football that spanned more than 40 year during his medical career. He was vice-chairman of the UEFA medical committee and medical advisor to FIFA. Early life William Stewart Hillis was born on 28 September 1943 in Clydebank, but was always known as Stewart. He was the son of a foreman at John Brown's shipyard. He was educated at Linnvale Primary and then Clydebank High School. He studied medicine at the University of Glasgow, graduating in 1967. He married Anne and they had three sons and a daughter. Academic medicine Hillis spent a year working at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1977, he was appointed as a consultant cardiologist at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow, then working at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow. Hillis started Bachelor of Science and Masters courses in Sports Medicine at the University of Glasgow in 1995 and was course director until 2012. In 1997, the University of Glasgow awarded Hillis a personal chair in cardiology and exercise medicine. Sports medicine =Club football= In 1970 Hillis became the team doctor for Clydebank F.C. and remained in this position for 27 years. He had a brief spell as club doctor at Rangers F.C. but during this period the club signed Daniel Prodan in 1998 without some significant medical problems being discovered before the completion of the deal. When the club's owner David Murray rushed the deal for the player through, Hillis hadn't been allowed the normal amount of time to complete his medical checks. =International football= In 1976, he began working with the Scottish Football Association to provide medical support for the Scotland national under-21 football team and he covered 54 matches. In 1982, he was promoted to cover the Scotland national team doctor. In 1985, at the Wales vs Scotland football match in Cardiff, the Scotland team manager Jock Stein collapsed and although Hillis and the team attempted resuscitation, Stein died from a heart attack. Hillis helped establish the Sports Medicine Centre inside Hampden Park, the first of its kind in a national stadium. He stepped down as the Scotland team doctor in 2010, but remained involved research and he continued to be involved with the SFA. He became the medical director of the SFA. In 1986, he became a member of UEFA's Medical Committee and he had several stints as vice-chairman of the committee. He was a medical adviser to FIFA. =Commonwealth Games= Hillis had been working with the medical team to prepare for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma in May 2014, however he continued to work until the middle of June. Awards and honours In 2008, Hillis was awarded the prestigious Sir Robert Atkin prize by the Institute of Sport and Exercise Medicine. He was awarded an OBE in the 2010 New Year Honours list for services to medicine and sport. In 2014, the British Association for Sports and Exercise Medicine (BASEM) awarded him the Roger Bannister medal, recognising an outstanding contribution to the field of Sport and Exercise Medicine over his lifetime. In July 2015 a project to look at how best to treat mental health issues encountered by footballers in Scotland was funded by the UEFA Research Grant Programme and was dedicated to Hillis. In October 2015, he was posthumously admitted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame.

July was the warmest ever month on record in the north- west. Events The July heat wave started after a week, when H√§rsn√§s in √ñsterg√∂tland County recorded after hot continental air came into the south of the country. The southerly coastal areas recorded particularly warm nights, with Karlskrona recording a night minimum of on 9 July. The heat remained stabled and quite normal until the second half of the month, when heat warnings were released by the Meteorological Office. The heat affected all of Sweden, but was particularly abnormally hot in the north. Tropical nights were recorded in the coastal north and by the Atlantic in the south on 22 and 23 July Ume√• had its warmest temperature since 1882 with . The temperature record of nearby islet Holm√∂n was beaten by more than three degrees and topped on an outlying island north of 63 degrees latitude. Several thunderstorms struck the country in some areas at this time, with the precipitation being unevenly distributed. fell on the same day in Motala, whilst nearby Link√∂ping only had of rainfall in all of July ‚Äì akin to mediterranean climates. The highest figure was on the same day in Emmaboda in the southern inland areas. The temperatures started to rise to new exceptional levels the final week of July and first week of August. Small islets Stor√∂n and R√∂dkallen on the central Norrland coast had a night minimum at on 26 July. The intense sunshine and warm winds brought temperatures to in H√∂kmarksberget in Skellefte√• Municipality the following day, with even a marine station (Bjur√∂klubb) going above for the first time ever. As seen in this official picture, temperatures were a lot warmer than usual with daily means being above in the most southerly areas, with temperatures approaching such means even far north. Even gloomy mountain areas such as √ñstersund and Storlien had warm months. Although the temperatures in the mountain ranges topped on average, more significant though was that both locations significantly bettered the July sunshine records. In August the heat wave in the far north got somewhat tempered, but for the first week the heatwave got new proportions in the southern and central parts of Sweden. After a few relatively calm days around a high- pressure system originating in the Baltic states came into the eastern parts of the country on 3 August, ensuring new nationwide high temperatures for the heatwave, although not matching the historic all-time highs. H√§rsn√§s once again tied for warmest in the country with , matching the values from Renbergsvattnet. 4 August was the hottest day of the year and for a few years before when far inland town Falun recorded , Other areas got affected by thunderstorms moderating temperatures the same day, but √ñrebro recorded ‚Äì the highest temperature in that city for decades, as well as Uppsala setting a new August record with . The highest overnight low was reached on 3 August on the uninhabited isolated island of Gotska Sand√∂n with a mere 0.1 ¬∞C below the nationwide all-time record for warmest low. Following this event, the heat cooled off and August in general was quite normal in terms of temperatures, with plentiful of precipitation. The warm waters surrounding Sweden during the autumn still led to thunderstorms happening as late as early November, something that is highly unusual. Milestones Several heat records were broken and the summer was unusually warm by such northerly marine standards. Apart from in neighbouring countries the heatwave was very much localised, and average temperatures were somewhat neutered by cooler spells interrupting the various intense bursts of heat, as well as the cool nights in Sweden that bring average temperatures down. In a Swedish context this was still a remarkable event, in particular the extremely warm temperatures far north. Small village Kvikkjokk north of the Arctic Circle had a July average high of and Lule√• had a daily mean of in a coastal location north of the 65th parallel. Sweden's second city Gothenburg tied for the warmest July month on record with a high of , a low of and a resulting mean of . Gothenburg's mean was the warmest in the country, but the warmest high mean was in Falun. The all-time record of the mean for Link√∂ping a 100 years earlier did however stand. A July average low of was measured at M√•sesk√§r off the west coast, where temperatures never fell below all month. The warm and dry local weather also contributed to intense wildfires in V√§stmanland County in early August that took several weeks to get under proper control. With the heat wave as a contributing factor along with the following mild autumn, 2014 was the warmest year on record in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂ ‚Äì the three largest cities in the country. The yearly mean of in Falsterbo was also the highest on record for the official stations mentioned every month in SMHI's data report. Lund recorded an average year high of . Among other unusual consequences of the heat wave was that Kiruna had a yearly mean of just above the freezing point, and Lule√•'s mean topping for the first time. Regions =Sk√•ne= Skan√∂r med Falsterbo set a new Swedish record for warmest yearly mean with . Its marine features rendered less severe daytime heat during the heat wave, but rather very warm nights. Daily July means went above , but the temperature record and individual monthly record both stood, with Falsterbo only once recording in its recorded history (as of 2016). In spite of the hypermarine features of the climate Falsterbo recorded 20 days above during the summer. In the wake of the heat wave Falsterbo had an October average low of the very mild . Lund in Sk√•ne had its warmest year on record, but its extremely warm July still did not match its 2006 record for the warmest month. Lund recorded 33 days with temperatures above . Its July mean of was also the warmest in the country, due to the very warm nights by Swedish standards, averaging around . Unlike areas further north, Lund did not experience a summer drought. =Eastern G√∂taland= Norrk√∂ping and the surrounding coastline through V√§stervik to the south Nyk√∂ping to the east had a very warm summer in spite of the near-coastal location. Norrk√∂ping had a yearly mean of , a new all-time record. Although the year was record warm, July did not beat the 1994 records, but it was still far warmer than a normal year. In total, 32 days of the year reached in Norrk√∂ping. =Svealand= Falun in Dalarna saw the warmest temperature of the year in the country with in early August. Its July was also the hottest in Sweden during daytime. July was so dry that it could easily be compared to mediterranean climates. August compensated for that with heavy rainfall. √ñrebro, (namesake county) had a very warm year with uneven precipitation patterns, with a summer drought and heavy rainfall in many other parts of the year. =Northern Norrland= Lule√• (Norrbotten), recorded the warmest month in Northern Norrland since 1925 with a July mean of . Considering the airport being in a rural setting, the urban area may well have surpassed Haparanda's 1925 reading. In spite of the high means a mere 14 days above was recorded in Lule√•. The warm temperatures both in July means and yearly means were due to the mild summer nights by the coastline. Lycksele saw a record warm summer with an extremely hot July considering its northerly latitude with summer highs approaching . As many as 31 days reached or went above .

It lies near the railway station (Gare d'Abbeville), next to the canal aqueduct over the River Somme. It was erected in 1907, by public subscription, in commemoration of the ordeal of Fran√ßois-Jean de la Barre, known as the Chevalier (enKnight) de La Barre. In 1766, at Abbeville, La Barre was tried, found guilty, and executed for failing to salute a religious procession. The monument is today an annual gathering point for defenders of secularism and freethinking. Chevalier de La Barre =Ordeal= On 1 July 1766, at Abbeville, a young man of 18 years of age, Fran√ßois-Jean Lefebvre de La Barre was beheaded for having failed to show religious respect. In applying the law, the judge committed him to have his bones crushed until he confessed his crime and denounced his accomplices, his tongue torn out, his right hand and head cut off, and their ashes thrown to the wind. The three principals in the case said that they had expected the judgment, having \\"been tried and convicted of letting pass twenty-five steps of a procession without doffing the hat on his head, not genuflecting, singing an unholy song, and making reference to infamous books, among which can be found Mr. Voltaire's Dictionnaire Philosophique\\". =Symbolism= An allegorical photograph depicting of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. After the French Revolution, the French National Convention of 15 November 1793 (in the French Republican Calendar, 25 Brumaire an II) pardoned La Barre posthumously as a \\"Victim of the Superstition\\". At the turn of the 19th to 20th centuries, with embattled public schools and the secularisation of institutions, which culimated in the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, La Barre became a symbol of the anticlerical battle. In 1904, the Paris City Council recovered that had been unlawfully obtained by the Archbishopric, and moved to build a statue of de La Barre there, in line with the Grand Portal of the Sacr√©-Coeur de Montmartre. This statue by Armand Bloch was inaugurated on 3 September 1905, witnessed by 25,000 people. It was removed in 1941 by the Vichy Government. It would take more than sixty years before a replacement was erected, not far from the original, in the Nadar Square. Beginnings In 1902, two teachers and two students of the lyc√©e in Abbeville founded the and moved to revive the memory of La Barre. On 14 July, Bastille Day, they laid a bouquet at his place of execution. The local authority () removed it immediately. This initiative was continued in the following years, culminating on 7 July 1907 when the La Barre Monument was unveiled. 15,000 supporters travelled to Abbeville by the trainload. The monument was funded by a lottery of 100,000 tickets at 25 centimes each. The monument has the form of a tapered column, on which is written the inscription (\\"Monument erected by the People to the Full Emancipation of Human Thought\\"). A bronze plaque was inserted into it, which represents the torture influcted on La Barre. This plaque reads (\\"In commemoration of the Martyr Knight La Barre tortured at Abbeville 1 July 1766 at the age of 19 years for having failed to salute a procession\\"). During the First World War the plaque was removed and placed on a train to be melted down, but a railway worker hid it in a stream, whencefrom it was recovered after the war. Ceremony In July 1903, following the 1902 gesture, around fifty people laid a wreath, which was again immediately removed by the local authority. In 1904, for the first time, the labour organisations of the Vimeu region, associated themselves with the event. A thousand people paid homage to the victim of religious intolerance. The framework of the (\\"La Barre Ceremony\\") was established, and remains to this day. From 1907, the ceremony's point of departure was the Monument La Barre and it finished at the place of his execution, near the town hall. For nearly sixty years, there was a joint ceremony of freethinkers, often coming from very far away, and the Department's workers' movements and secular organisations. In 1963, around twenty organisations - political parties and trades unions - took part in the ceremony. In 1986, the F√©d√©ration nationale de la libre pens√©e moved to commemorate the 220th anniversary of La Barre's execution. Thanks to this, the ceremony has once again become a model secular gathering. Vandalism The monument has been vandalised on numerous occasions. As of February 2015, the latest act of vandalism was on 22 June that year. Two crosses and a heart mounted on a cross, a symbol of Civitas, a right-wing Roman Catholic pressure group, had been drawn on it in black paint.

Crimes included the Wounded Knee incident, Patty Hearst kidnapping, court-martial of Clayton Lonetree, the murder of Vicki Morgan, and the Don Bolles car bombing. In a series of true crime books, Headley wrote about his investigations. Early Life and career Lake Headley was born in Indiana. He attended Goshen High School in Indiana. In the yearbook for 1948, at around age 16, he stated in that he wished to be a lawyer. He began his career as a police officer in Las Vegas, but his killing of a suspect when a young officer, prompted him to quit policing and become a p.i. In 1962, he left the force, where he was a detective, to become one of the first private detectives in Las Vegas. He went on to work for thirty years in the field, and was considered one of the best. Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi called Headley, \\"the best private investigator on earth.\\" Patty Hearst and the SLA During the Patty Hearst kidnapping saga, two of the families of SLA members, including Willie Wolfe's father, contracted Headley to investigate the matter. Headley concluded his investigation, and filed a sworn affidavit of his findings. Among these included: > That Patricia Campbell Hearst and her parents disagreed bitterly over > Patricia's political and personal relations. That a love affair between a > black man and Patricia Hearst did take place prior to her relationship with > her fianc√© Steven Weed. That Mrs. Randolph A. Hearst subjected her daughter > to extreme pressure to change her personal and political relationships. On May 4, 1974, Headley, along with freelance writer Donald Freed, held a press conference in San Francisco. They presented 400 pages of documentation of their findings, some of which included: * a year before the kidnapping Patty Hearst had visited convict, Donald DeFreeze, who later became the SLA's figurehead. * DeFreeze's arrest records; * the work of Colston Westbrook with Los Angeles Police Department's CCS (Criminal Conspiracy Section) and the State of California's Sacramento-based CII (Criminal Identification and Investigation) unit.;Churchill, Ward & Vander Wall, Jim, \\"Agents of Repression: The FBI's secret wars against the Black Panther Party\\", 2002 and * evidence of links of the CIA to Police Departments.Russell, Dick, \\"Who Ran the SLA?\\", Argosy, Ann Arbor Sun, January 22, 1976, On May 17, 1974, The New York Times ran the story of DeFreeze and the Los Angeles Police Department.Kifner, John, \\"Cinque: A Dropout Who Has Been in Constant Trouble; School Dropout On Welfare Wanted to Sell Bombs Recommendation Ignored Cooperation Indicated Charges Dropped\\", The New York Times, May 17, 1974 However, the story was largely overlooked due to this being the day of the shoot out and conflagration that killed DeFreeze and five other members of the SLA. In a book he co-wrote with freelance writer, William Hoffman, Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Detective, he presented well-documented evidence that Donald DeFreeze, was a police informant and an agent provocateur. Headley also uncovered evidence that, in the house fire in LA that killed six members of the SLA, at least one of the suspects was shot in the back while trying to surrender.

First trials of a system called Weigh and Vend were run by Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd in April 2004 in three selected Post Offices. While the machines catered for a range of different mail categories, the apparent complexity and relative slowness deterred customers. Post and Go machines from three suppliers (IBM, Fujitsu, and Pitney-Bowes) trialled in 2007 in nine locations, and in 2008 these machines were replaced by Nixdorf machines, and 700 machines were rolled-out nationwide. The first Nixdorf Post & Go machines were installed in The Galleries, Bristol, on 8 October 2008, followed by those in Sunderland and South Shields post offices on 10 October 2008. There are two main groups of Post & Go stamps: * Those with service inscriptions and without an explicitly imprinted value exist for a variety of postal services such as letters and postcards of the lowest weight steps to be sent First Class Mail, Second Class Mail, or Air Mail. They can be printed both on labels bearing the so-called Machin head effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, or with a field showing a pictorial design and a small silhouette of the Queen's head in the corner of the latter. * Another group are stamps for services like heavier letters and small parcels, where the price depends on the weight. These show the type of service and the price. Originally, they only showed a security print on their left side and a \\"post by\\" date (for posting no later than the day after issue) and were not supposed to be cancelled (this in line with the usage of Horizon labels). The current Open value stamps are only printed on labels with the Machin head design, do not show a \\"post by\\" date and are treated as any other postage stamps. Pictorial designs of Post & Go stamps of the United Kingdom include until now (2015) the Union Flag, various animals and flowers, sea travel, and heraldic beasts. Post & Go stamps have also been issued in Jersey since 2014, and in Guernsey, Gibraltar and Qatar since 2015. Jersey has issued stamps showing the country's flag as well as a set showing protected animals, while all stamps of Guernsey and Gibraltar show their flag. The stamps of Qatar show the country's coat of arms. Post & Go stamps with extra inscriptions have been issued on occasion of various philatelic events, and also for selected institutions. The large number of possible combinations of service types, designs, and additional inscriptions pose challenges to collectors. An overprint code in the lower left corner of the stamps allows to trace their origin, since the first six figures in the code correspond to the vending machine from which the stamps were sold.

It has been serialized in Shueisha's Jump Square monthly magazine since November 2015. The series follows Mirai Kakehashi, a student who attempts suicide but is rescued by his guardian angel, Nasse, who not only has vowed to protect him, but bestows him special powers as he is also one of 13 candidates chosen by different angels to take the role of God, who is to retire in 999 days. Platinum End is licensed by Viz Media in North America and the United Kingdom, with its chapters released digitally in English as they are published in Japan. Plot Mirai Kakehashi is a young student fed up with a life of abuse from his uncle and aunt who raised him since his parents' death, but is saved by a Guardian Angel called Nasse after attempting to commit suicide. Upon learning from Nasse that his foster parents were responsible for the deaths of his father and mother, Mirai uses the powers she bestowed him in order to confront them and enact justice. However, Mirai's ordeals are just beginning as Nasse soon after informs him that God will retire in 999 days and thirteen candidates to replace him were selected including Mirai himself. To make matters worse, not only can Mirai not refuse to take part in the contest to decide the next God, but among the other candidates there are those capable of anything to win, including killing all the competition as soon as possible. Characters =Main= ; :The main protagonist. He was raised by his abusive uncle and aunt after his family were killed in a car crash. The abuse he endured resulted in him trying to commit suicide by throwing himself from a tower block, but he is saved by Nasse. Using the arrows he discovers that his uncle and aunt murdered his family, he accidentally kills his aunt and then makes his uncle turn himself in. Upon knowing of Metropoliman's plans, Mirai joins forces with Saki and Nanato to stop him, not only to protect themselves, but to prevent him from becoming God as well. ; :Mirai's angel. All angels bestow special abilities on their hosts and based on their rank, the abilities they bestow vary. Nasse is a special-rank angel, granting Mirai all three angel abilities including wings which grants Mirai the ability to fly, a white arrow that allows the user to instantly kill anyone it hits, and a red arrow that allows the user to make whoever it hits fall in love with them for 33 days, though not if the target is already under the influence of another user's red arrow. Her main desire is to make Mirai happy. Despite having a cute face, she has the habit of making some cruel remarks. ; :Saki is Mirai's classmate, his love interest, and coincidentally, a God candidate as well. Once she learns that he does not intend to kill her, Saki joins forces with Mirai to deal with Metropoliman. Saki and Mirai were once childhood friends, but after his parents' death, Mirai became the target of bullying from his classmates and Saki did nothing to stop them out of peer pressure. She witnessed Mirai's suicide attempt in the beginning of the series, and out of guilt, she also did so by trying to drown herself on the sea, leading her to meet Revel and become a God candidate. ; :Saki's angel. He is rather calculating and manipulative, a trait that is considered by Nasse to be the reason why he was relegated to be second-rank angel, thus capable only of bestowing Saki with the red arrow. Once he decides to become more useful to Saki, Revel decides to study the knowledge of the heavens, in order to increase his rank and grant wings to Saki, but fails. However, when Revel sheds tears at not being of further use to Saki, God promotes him to first- rank and bestows him the title of \\"Angel of Emotion\\", as no angel had shed tears for a human before. This rank raise grants him the ability to bestow wings onto Saki. =God Candidates and Angels= ; :The main antagonist of the series who intends to become God by all means necessary, including killing all other candidates. He is the grandson of the principal of the prestigious Joso Academy and wishes to become God in order to bring his dead sister back to life. So far he had killed four other candidates using the alias \\"Metropoliman\\" and had claimed their wings and arrows, becoming even more dangerous upon realizing that several arrows can be combined to increase their range, and that the arrows and wings he obtained can be bestowed to other individuals to do his bidding. ; :Kanade's angel of the special-rank, also known as the \\"Angel of Lust\\". ; :A god candidate who is a failed comedian. He uses his red arrows to make women fall in love with him so that he can have sex with them. He is the first God candidate to be killed, being murdered by Kanade as Metropoliman. ; :Tonma's angel of the second-rank. ; and :Two god candidates who disguises themselves as different versions of Metropoliman when Kanada asks the God candidates to attend a gathering at a baseball stadium. They are friends who want to help each other after doing badly in their exams, and are saved from committing suicide by their guardian angels. However, the gathering is a trap and both are killed by the real Metropoliman. ; and :Shogo and Saburo's angels respectively, both of the first-rank. ; :Chiyo is the youngest God candidate. She is a young girl who was bullied at school. She attends the gathering and asks Metropoliman for help. Kanade first strikes her with a red arrow, but then uses her as a hostage saying he will kill her if no other God candidates reveal themselves. As no-one does, Kanade kills Chiyo. ; :Chiyo's angel of the second-rank. ; :Nanato is a God candidate working as the product planner for an apparel company. He is suffering from terminal cancer, and first uses his red arrows to secure enough money for his family after he dies, then to hire private detectives to find more God candidates. He decides to team up with Mirai and Saki in order to prevent Kanade from becoming God, to the point of obtaining firearms from the JSDF in order to have a better chance to kill him. Mirai agrees on the grounds that Nanato continues his treatment. ; :Nanato's angel of the first-rank, also known as the \\"Angel of Knowledge\\", she once were of the special-rank, before being demoted for unknown reasons. ; :Born poor and ugly, Hajime was always shunned by others until his mother commits suicide and Balta appears to become his angel. Using Balta's powers, Hajime manages to obtain money and a new, beautiful face by plastic surgery, but still is unable to attract a girl himself due to his poor communication skills. He develops an obscession with Kanade and offers to become his subordinate, which he accepts, but only in exchange of capturing another God Candidate. He then manages to discover Nanato's identity and kidnaps his wife and daughter in order to draw him to a trap. He manages to capture both Nanato and Mirai, but waiting for a chance to kill them, he ends up struck by Saki's red arrow. ; :Hajime's angel of the first-rank, also known as the \\"Angel of Intuition\\". ; :Yoneda's angel of the special-rank, also known as the \\"Angel of Destruction\\". ; :Susumu Yuito's angel of the first-rank, also known as the \\"Angel of Games\\". ; :Yuri Temari's angel of the second-rank, also known as the \\"Angel of Truth\\". ; :Shuji Nakaumi's angel of the first-rank, also known as the \\"Angel of Darkness\\". =Others= ; :An amateur model, known as the \\"Serial Killer Girl A\\", she was arrested for the murder of several female middle schoolers until Kanade breaks her free and lends her a red arrow and a pair of wings from the God candidates he previously eliminated, in order to lay a trap for other God candidates who may appear intending to stop her after she starts killing again. Media =Manga= Platinum End has been serialized by Shueisha in its Japanese monthly sh≈çnen manga magazine Jump SQ since its December 2015 issue, which was released on November 4, 2015. They began collecting the chapters into tank≈çbon volumes with the first published on February 4, 2016. As of September 4, 2020, thirteen volumes have been released. On October 5, 2015, Viz Media announced that it has licensed Platinum End for release in North America and the United Kingdom. In March 2016, Viz confirmed that they would start releasing print editions of Platinum End, with the first volume released in October 2016. The manga is licensed by Kaz√© in France. Volume list Chapters not yet in tank≈çbon format Reception The first volume of Platinum End debuted at number two on Oricon's weekly list of the best-selling manga, with 105,213 copies sold. When reviewing the opening chapter, Ian Wolf writing for Anime UK News compared Platinum End to Ohba and Obata's earlier series Death Note, saying: \\"the central character is a teenage boy fed up with life, who is guided by a supernatural force and given great power. Both leads seemingly find themselves on the path to becoming a deity. However, while Light Yagami uses his powers for diabolic ends, killing anyone he suspects of doing anything wrong while being observed by a shinigami, Mirai Kakehashi is guided by an apparently more benevolent force.\\" He also writes that the series is an example of a death game, citing the death of one of the God candidates in the second chapter. Writing for The Fandom Post Jarius Taylor gave the series a B+ rating and compared Platinum End to Future Diary writing: \\"while I don't have too much doubt it'll be stronger overall, the overt edginess here isn't something I was quite expecting from Ohba. Still it's a pretty interesting read from beginning to end, and there's a lot of potential in terms of both thriller aspects and the overall theme. Hopefully, it'll be able to differentiate itself from Future Diary more going forward, but for now the idea of Ohba and Obata taking a crack at their own version of it seems pretty good to me.\\" References External links *Platinum End official website * Category:2015 manga Category:Dark fantasy anime and manga Category:Death games in fiction Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Shueisha manga Category:Supernatural thriller anime and manga Category:Takeshi Obata Category:Viz Media manga ","title":"Platinum End"},{"id":"48440163","text":"Tommy Chuck Yiu Kwok (, born 29 May 1994 in Hong Kong) is a former Hong Kong professional football player who played as a forward.

History  Diablo Blvd was founded in 2005 by vocalist Alex Agnew, known as a successful stand-up comedian in Benelux and guitarist Dave Hubrechts. The band was completed by guitarist and songwriter Andries Beckers from Born From Pain, bassist Tim Bekaert from A Brand and drummer Kris Martens from Tangled Horns. In 2006 the band released the demo Scarred and Undefeated on cassette and signed a contract with PIAS, Play It Again Sam. Over a period of two years, Diablo Blvd was working on their debut album The Greater God, which was produced by Ace Zec. The album reached #33 in the Belgian album charts in 2009. The band started playing at mainstream festivals in Belgium such as Graspop Metal Meeting and Pukkelpop. In 2011 they released their second studio album Builders of Empires, mixed by Swedish producer Jens Bogren. The album debuted at #21 in the Belgian album charts. The single \\"Black Heart Bleed\\" still builds to almost anthemic proportions at every live show they play. They shot their first music video for the song \\"Saint of Killers\\", which is based on a fictional character who appears in the acclaimed comic book series Preacher. In May 2014, their third studio album Follow the Deadlights was released by Sony Music and went up to #3 in the Belgian album charts. The album was recorded in the ICP Studio in Brussels and mixed by Jay Ruston and mastered by Paul Logus who both have previously been behind the sound of Anthrax (band), Stone Sour, Meat Loaf and Steel Panther. In November 2014, Diablo Blvd signed a worldwide deal with Nuclear Blast. CEO Markus Staiger was loudly impressed with the song \\"Rise Like Lions\\". Follow the Deadlights was released by Nuclear Blast on January 23, 2015. Dave Hubrechts left the band and Tim Bekaert switched to guitar. At the same time, the band played in clubs and festivals during a European promotion tour of 17 months as well as opening act for Epica, Machine Head, Ace Frehley and Life of Agony in US. On June 28, 2018, it was announced the band would be breaking up following several shows to take place throughout the rest of the year, with the final show taking place on December 10 at the Ancienne Belgique.  Influences  Building on groovy riffs, catchy choruses and a charismatic stage presence, Diablo Blvd offers what made their heroes great within a wide range of influences from the heavy genre like Danzig, The Cult, Guns ‚ÄòN Roses, Black Label Society and Type O Negative and classic rock. The band name Diablo Blvd comes from a song of the American band Corrosion of Conformity from the album America's Volume Dealer. Vocalist Pepper Keenan came with the idea for this title when he visited his friend James Hetfield, the singer of the band Metallica one day in his house. The street behind Hetfield's House is called Diablo Blvd.  Diablo Fest  In May 2014 Diablo Blvd organised their own ‚Äì soldout - metal festival Diablo Fest in Trix, Antwerp to promote their third studio album Follow The Deadlights and to give a platform to upcoming bands in the Benelux metal scene, like Vanderbuyst (NL), The Setup (BE), King Hiss (BE) and Your Highness (BE). In October 2015 they celebrated their 10th anniversary with a second edition of Diablo Fest. The line-up featured Bark (BE), Born From Pain (NL), Fifty Foot Combo (BE) and John Coffey (NL).

It yields some 60 000 ‚Äì 80 000 cubic meters of water per day, and is affected by exploitation and pollution by the gold mining industry in the region, deep‚Äìlevel gold mining having markedly impacted on the dolomitic aquifers. http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/3/1/291 This spring is located in dolomitic rock that is part of the larger Boskop‚ÄìTurffontein dolomite compartment in the Transvaal Basin. Dolomite is a sedimentary carbonate rock, a swath of which runs parallel to the Magaliesberg, and has a tendency to form large underground lakes and reservoirs. Potchefstroom is one of the largest towns in the area and was established in 1838. Water from the spring is used for the domestic needs of Potchefstroom, and is also utilised by local farmers. The farm on which the spring is located was known to the Voortrekkers and was first occupied by a certain Gerhard Breytenbach, also in 1838. Emil Holub travelled through the region in 1873, and later described the natural springs he encountered in his book 'Sieben Jahre in S√ºd Africa' published in 1881. He also remarked on the funnel-shaped sinkholes he came across. Sammy Marks, the pioneer industrialist of the Transvaal, bought the farm in the 1890s and constructed an irrigation canal to supply water for his crops. The contractor who built the canal was Pieter Bezuidenhout, who had in 1880 refused to hand over his wagon in lieu of unpaid taxes levied by the British authorities - this action led to the First Boer War. http://www.ruralexploration.co.za/Gerhard%20Minnebron.html Environmental issues The strong discharge of groundwater from the spring has created an area of peatland or karst fen. The vast majority of peat is located in the high-rainfall regions of the northern hemisphere and its occurrence in South Africa is rare. The spring is fed by water issuing from a system of interlinked dolomitic aquifers or compartments. Four of the nine compartments which feed the Wonderfonteinspruit are affected by deep level gold mining. Large-scale pumping of water has led to a lowering of the groundwater table by up to 1000 metres, the trapping of uranium-bearing tailings in caves and sinkholes, the discharge of pollutants into the Wonderfonteinspruit, and seepage from tailings into the aquifer beneath. http://www.imwa.info/docs/imwa_2009/IMWA2009_Winde.pdf External links *Peatlands as Filters for Polluted Mine Water?‚ÄîA Case Study from an Uranium- Contaminated Karst System in South Africa References Category:Springs of South Africa ","title":"Gerhardminnebron"},{"id":"48440211","text":"Anton Balthasar K√∂nig was a German historian and genealogist.

In addition to the Camadevivamsa, which is also known in English as The Legend of Queen CamaSwearer and The Chamadevivongs,Harza Bodhiramsi also composed, in 1417, the Tamnan Phraphutthasihing,Swearer. p xxi another chronicle which describes the history of the Phra Phuttha Sihing image, from its creation in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) to its enshrinement in 1411 at Chiang Mai, the capital of Lanna. Historical background Haripunchai was a kingdom affiliated with Dvaravati, a Theravada Buddhist culture that existed in a loose confederacy of Mon-ruled principalities in the area of present-day Thailand from the sixth to thirteenth centuries.Rohanadeera pp 47‚Äì49 Known as a center of scholarship and Theravada study at a time when other kingdoms in the area were still practicing a form of Hinduism, Dvaravati played a major role in diffusing Buddhism and Indian culture to the rest of Southeast Asia. The southern portion of Dvaravati came under increasing influence from the growing Khmer Empire culminating in an invasion by Suryavarman II in the early twelfth century. Haripunjaya remained independent and flourished until defeated in 1281 or 1292 by Mangrai, leader of the fledgling Tai city states in what is now northern Laos. Mangrai united the city states and, incorporating conquered Haripunjaya, founded the kingdom of Lanna. Lanna embraced and adopted the Indianized Buddhist culture of Haripunjaya, continuing the tradition of scholarship and spreading the Theravada religion to the Tai peoples. It was in this context that Bodhiramsi wrote the Camadevivamsa. The text The Camadevivamsa is a palm leaf manuscript written in the Tai Tham script and is housed at a monastery in Northern Thailand. The first, and only, edition of the complete Pali text was published, in Thai script with a side-by-side Thai translation, in 1920 and is currently located in the Wachirayan Library in Bangkok. Five years later, George C≈ìd√®s published a commentary on some of the Northern Thai Chronicles in which he included a French translation of chapters 12, 13 and part of 14.Swearer, pg xxv A Thai translation was printed in 1967 by the Fine Arts Department and the Social Research Institute of Chiang Mai University holds a microfilm copy of the original palm leaf manuscript. A full English translation and commentary, which, in contrast to previous analyses, treats the Camadevivamsa as a religious \\"mythic-legendary (narrative) in which etiology, cosmology and Buddhist doctrine take precedence over historical facts\\",Swearer, pg xxiii was published in 1998 by Donald Swearer. Early study of the Northern Thai Chronicles by Western scholars was focused on searching for factual and historical details within the texts to compare and contrast with those of other documents and inscriptions. Little attention was given to the cultural implications such as religious, mythological or legendary significance. For example, George C≈ìd√®s criticized the Camadevivamsa for its lack of verifiable historical facts.C≈ìd√®s, 1925 However, modern scholarship recognizes the text as a 15th-century religio-cultural work written primarily as a foundation myth for the ancient Mon Hariphunchai to establish its connection and cultural continuity with the Thai city of Lamphun in the Lanna kingdom,Swearer, 1998 as well as to substantiate the legendary visit of the Buddha to the region and legitimize both the Buddha relic and the temple in which it is housed.Swearer, pg 5 Narrative structure The Camadevivamsa displays elements of both a Jataka and tamnan, or Thai chronicle of the development of Buddhism in relation to Thai history.Kasetsiri, Chapter 1 The narrative opens with the story of the Buddha's past visit to Haripunchai and relates his prophecy that a relic will be found there centuries later by King Adittaraja, an event which occurs in the final chapter, framing the narrative in a manner similar to that of a Jataka, in which the final chapter serves a literary device connecting past and present.Swearer, pg 5 The second chapter also recounts a legend from the distant past, telling of an ascetic sage (rishi) named Vasudeva. Jamadevi, a pregnant Mon princess of the Lavo Kingdom, with Vasudeva's help, \\"create order out of chaos\\" and \\"build a walled, moated city ... out of the jungle ... and bring civilization\\" to the indigenous people called Millakkha, which is believed to refer to the Lawa,Swearer, pg 6 the animist Mon-Khmer people who inhabited the region north of Lavo before the arrival of the Mon. Chapter three tells of the building of Haripuchai and in chapter four, Jamadevi is consecrated as its Queen. Following this, chapters five and six for a synopsis of events recorded in another Northern Thai chronicle, the Jinakalamalipakarnam. Chapter seven recounts the battles between Jamadevi's new city and the surrounding Lawa people, which culminates in a victory for Haripunchai. In the following chapter, Jamadevi arranges for her two sons to marry the two daughters of the defeated Lawa chief, bringing all of the surrounding peoples under the subjugation of Haripunchai. Chapters nine, ten and eleven tell of Jamadevi's expansion of Haripunchai and her expeditions to the reaches of her realm, including the new cities which she founded. In chapter eleven is also found the story of her death. Chapter twelve chronicles the long line of royal succession of the Jamadevi dynasty which culminates with Adittaraja, whose reign is recorded in chapter 13. The remainder of chapter 13 and the following chapter tell of Adittaraja's war with Haripunchai's sister kingdom to the south, the Mon Lavo, and his eventual victory. The chronicle ends with Adittaraja's discovery of the Buddha relic in chapter 15. Modern folk veneration Popular folk veneration of Jamadevi has seen a resurgence in the modern era, especially in the Northern region of Thailand. A memorial statue was built in Lamphun that has become a devotional center for worshipers. Nationwide media coverage was given to a former television personality who claims to be possessed by the spirit of Jamadevi and people across Thailand seek Jamadevi's blessing on things as mundane as picking lottery numbers.Thai Rath, 31 August 2014 Notes References   * * Category:Pali Buddhist texts Category:Thai chronicles Category:Mon people Category:15th century in Siam Category:Thai Buddhist texts ","title":"CƒÅmadeviva·πÉsa"},{"id":"48440269","title":"1992‚Äì93 FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup"},{"id":"48440280","text":"Department of Geodesy Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology ‚Äì continues the tradition of the Department of Surveying and Cartography, established at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology in 1945 (formal appointment of the new Department: October 1, 1945, and the formal appointment of the head of the Department: September 1, 1946).RozporzƒÖdzenie Ministra O≈õwiaty z dn. 16 marca 1946 (Nr IV-2035/46), w sprawie utworzenia katedr na Politechnice Gda≈Ñskiej, z mocƒÖ obowiƒÖzywania od 1 pa≈∫dziernika 1945.

His parents were the Hannoversche Major Georg Poten (1799‚Äì1882) and Juliane Dorothea Kannengie√üer (1804‚Äì1841). His uncle Friedrich Poten (1779‚Äì1845), Hanoverian lieutenant colonel, was made hereditary baron in 1827 by Grand Duke Ludwig I of Baden. His nephew continued the baronial lineage. In 1861, Poten married Anna Sophie Elisabeth Behncke (1837‚Äì1905) in Celle. They had a son Heinrich Georg Wilhelm Alexander von Poten (1863‚Äì1920) also a Prussian major general and commander of the Cuirassiers in Brandenburg. Poten died in Berlin on 22 November 1909. Career Berhard von Poten served from 1847 to 1866 in the Hanover Military services. In 1847, he was a second lieutenant, and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1854 and in 1863 to captain. As such, he belonged to the Hanoverian Queens Hussar Regiment. In 1867, Poten was squadron leader in Hussar Regiment no. 4. His promotion to major came in 1870. Between 1871 and 1874, he was on the staff of the regiment and 1874‚Äì1884 adjutant at the General Inspectorate of the military education and training system. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1875, and then to colonel in 1878.

His classmates included Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, who became five-star generals. White graduated 158th in the class of 164. World War I Commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 26th Infantry on 12 June 1915, White's first posting was to Brownsville, Texas, where he served with the Pancho Villa Expedition. He became a first lieutenant in the newly-formed 36th Infantry on 1 July 1916. He transferred to the 17th Cavalry on the Mexican border on 13 January 1917. With the United States' entry into World War I, artillery was in greater demand than cavalry. White was transferred to the field artillery on 13 July 1917, with a promotion to captain backdated to 15 May 1917. He was assigned to the 11th Field Artillery on the Mexican border at Douglas, Arizona, except for a brief posting to the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, from 11 August to 1 October 1917. He married Therese Sterling Bain, a Vassar College graduate from Canajoharie, New York, in Douglas on 15 September 1917. They had a son, Arthur Bain White, who was born in 1921. The 11th Field Artillery moved to Camp Doniphan, Oklahoma, on 24 April 1918, where he was promoted to major on 3 July 1918. He commanded the 3rd Field Artillery Training Regiment at Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky, from 9 July to 4 August 1918, and was with the 37th Field Artillery at Camp Lewis, Washington from 9 August 1918 to 20 February 1919, as its commander from 15 December 1918. On 5 March 1919, he was transferred to the 83rd Field Artillery at Camp Knox, Kentucky, where he remained until 9 September 1919. Between the wars White served overseas with American forces in France from 9 September 1919 to 14 November 1919, when he returned to the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill for a battery commander's course. Like many other officers, he was reduced in rank to captain on 13 February 1920, but was promoted to major again on 10 September 1920. He served with the 82nd Field Artillery at Fort Bliss, Texas, from December 1920 to May 1921, and then with the 11th Field Artillery at Schofield Barracks in the Territory of Hawaii from October 1921 to July 1924. He was reduced in rank to captain again on 4 November 1922. He was then posted to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served with the 5th Field Artillery from November 1924 until August 1926. While there he was promoted to major for the third and final time on 16 September 1925. From August 1926 to June 1927, White completed the Advanced Course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas from September 1926 to June 1928. From 9 July 1928 to 27 June 1934 he was Assistant Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Harvard University. He then returned to the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, this time as an instructor in Tactics and Communications from 1 August 1934 to 22 June 1938. After nearly 20 years as a major, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 11 January 1937. This was followed by a tour as executive officer of the 1st Field Artillery there from 3 July 1938 to 30 June 1939, and with the historical section at the Army War College from 15 August 1939 to 12 November 1940. World War II On 18 November 1940, White became Assistant Chief of Staff (G3) of the VIII Corps at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. He was promoted to colonel on 26 June 1941. For this service, he received a Commendation Ribbon. In December 1942 he joined the staff of Major General Alexander M. Patch's XIV Corps in the South Pacific Area, initially as Assistant Chief of Staff (G4), and then as Chief of Staff. He participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign, for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit. White returned to the United States with Patch in April 1943, to become Chief of Staff of Patch's new command, the IV Corps, which was then based at Fort Lewis. IV Corps conducted training in Washington, and then desert warfare training in the California-Arizona Maneuver Area. In March 1944, IV Corps headquarters departed for North Africa. While most of the headquarters traveled by sea, Patch, White, Lieutenant Colonel William W. Quinn (G2), Colonel John S. Guthrie (G3), Lieutenant Colonel Eldon H. Larecy and Captain John M. Warner (Patch's aide) travelled by air in a C-54, arriving in Algiers on 2 Match 1944. On arrival, Patch discovered that the Commanding General North African Theater of Operations (NATOUSA), Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers had appointed him to command the Seventh United States Army. The previous commanding general, Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr. Patton, had taken most of his staff to the European Theater of Operations (ETOUSA), so Patch replaced them with members of his IV Corps staff. All of the officer's Patch had brought with him on the plane were transferred to Seventh Army, along with the G1, Lieutenant Colonel William H. Craig. All took up the corresponding post at the new headquarters, except for Larecy, who became deputy to the G4, Colonel Oliver C. Harvey, who remained from Patton's staff. All were in their thirties except White, who preferred to work with young officers. The mission of Seventh Army was Operation Anvil, the Allied landing in the south of France. Patch and White traveled to London in May to confer about the operation with Eisenhower and Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee. White took the opportunity to visit Eton and St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. In keeping with his new responsibilities, White was promoted to brigadier general on 24 May 1944, although his substantive rank was of colonel from 1 June 1944. White served as Seventh Army Chief of Staff throughout the campaign in Southern France and later Germany. He was promoted to major general on 15 November 1944 on the same promotion list as classmate James A. Van Fleet. For his services with the Seventh Army he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and an oak leaf cluster and an oak leaf cluster to his Legion of Merit. He was also made an officer of the French Legion of Honor and awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm. Later life White commanded the 75th Infantry Division, then in the process of preparing to redeploy to the Pacific, from June to November 1945. He then commanded the 71st Infantry Division in Bavaria until February 1946. He returned to the United States, where he assumed command of the V Corps Artillery, with the rank of brigadier general from 1 August 1946. For this, he was awarded a second Commendation Ribbon. He was promoted to major general again on 24 January 1948, with the substantive rank of brigadier general. His final command was of the 9th Infantry Division, which he assumed on 8 March 1948. He retired from Army on 30 September 1949, with the rank of major general on the retired list. In retirement, White settled in Asheville, North Carolina, where he liked to hunt and fish and pursued his hobby of carpentry. He subsequently moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina, in 1971. On 5 November 1980, he suffered a stroke, and was hospitalized in the Fayetteville Veterans Administration Hospital, where he died on 21 October 1981, his 92nd birthday. He was survived by his wife Therese and son Colonel Arthur B. White. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

From Bahrain, the business spread to Saudi Arabia in the 1930s. Business overview The family business first made its name in the shipping industry, challenging the long- established British firms that had come to dominate the Arabian Peninsula. Kanoo Shipping is the first Arab shipping agency in the region in 1911 and one of the founders of S5 Agency World Ltd. At present, Kanoo Shipping is the largest regional shipping agency in the Middle East which operates in 20 countries and all principal ports and offshore tanker loading terminals around the Arabian Peninsula, including Iraq.

History  The industrial revolution of the 19th century led to a dramatic increase in accidents at work. Therefore, in 1877 the St. John's Ambulance Association of the Order of St. John was established in England. In many cities, medical schools were set up and volunteers trained. In the summer of 1881, the German surgeon Friedrich von Esmarch (1823-1908) met St John's Ambulance Association leadership in London and founded a Samaritan school on his return to Germany. Numerous notes from the German-Samaritan-Federation were subsequently issued, however, they were directed primarily to senior health officials and were inclusive of the broad mass of workers. In 1888, six carpenters in Berlin took the initiative and set up the first course on the First Aid in the event of a disaster on 29 November 1888, and founded the first column of what would become the Workers' Samaritan Federation Germany. Soon these courses became a regular commitment of the association, which changed its name in 1895 to \\"Samariterkursus f√ºr Arbeiter und Arbeiterinnen\\" (Samaritan courses for workers). In 1909, 11 Samaritan workers columns joined forces to form the Workers' Samaritan League at a founding meeting in Magdeburg. The first seat of the federation was Berlin. In 1923, two chemist Samaritans, Theodor Kretzschmar and Eugen Richter, were elected as Federal Councilor and Federal Treasurer of the ASB. This meant the relocation of the ASB's headquarters to Chemnitz. In Herchen, the ASB operated a recreation centre during this period. In 1933 about 48,000 members of the ASB were active in 1,510 columns. Arnd Kr√ºger, James Riordan (Eds): The German way of worker sports, in: The Story of Worker Sport. Champaign, Ill.: Human Kinetics 1996, 1‚Äì25. Beckmanns Sportlexikon. A-Z. Otto Beckmann, Vienna 1933, column 164 f. After the rise Adolf Hitler, the ASB was placed under National Socialist leadership. After 1945, in the Soviet occupation zone, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany suppressed the ASB, which consequently did not exist in the later German Democratic Republic. In Western Germany, former workers' Samaritans in various regions of Germany sought to rebuild the ASB immediately after the end of the war. With the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany, the ASB developed supra- regional structures. In April 1952 ASB Deutschland eV was officially founded. The seat of the federation was initially Hanover, then with the construction of new federal headquarters, the seat was moved to S√ºlz. After German reunification, the ASB was established in 1990 in the eastern federal states.

Migration history During the period of French rule, there were almost no official controls on settlement by French nationals into the colonies. The European community of Dakar was dominated by the French, but also including whites from outside France. The community was marked by significant divisions of social class: in particular, French men in the colonial administration looked down on the rest of the European population. Aside from the administrators, the French population in Senegal during the period between the world wars contained rich merchant families from Bordeaux as well as smaller traders and their employees, as well as a large transient population of missionaries and travellers. French people required no identity cards or passports to travel in Senegal, making it easy to assume false identities and creating significant difficulties in policing them. Administrators expressed frustration with the influx of criminals and other \\"undesirables\\" from metropolitan France, which ran counter to what they saw as the French \\"civilising mission\\" to present \\"morally upright\\" role models for Africans to emulate. When Senegal achieved independence in 1960, there were estimated to be 40,000 French people in the country, three-fourths in Dakar alone. Though Dakar in particular featured a far higher proportion of non-indigenous population than many surrounding African countries in which racial conflict had become apparent, inter-ethnic relations there were characterised by an \\"apparent absence of any colour problem\\" . It had been expected that most French would soon return to France after independence, but a decade later, there were still 29,000 living in the country, involved with French aid and capital investment; their presence reflected the continued dependence of France's African colonies on the m√©tropole. By the 21st century, Senegal had also become home to an increasing population of poor and even destitute French expatriates. Taking advantage of low-cost air travel, they arrived in Senegal as sight-seers but then remained in the country due to the relatively lax entry requirements, and cut off their ties with French society. Some of them developed health issues such as meningoencephalitis, staphylococcal infection of the skin, and the like, worsened by their failure or inability to seek medical attention. Politics 9,517 French expatriates came to polling stations in Dakar to vote in the 2007 French presidential election.

Five crewmen died. The ship was so damaged that attempted to scuttle it soon after. Construction The Wentworth was built by Richardson, Duck & Company of Stockton on Tees in 1919. She was originally named the War Phlox. Sinking In April 1943, Wentworth, under the command of Reginald Gilbert Phillips, joined Convoy ONS 5 (outward, northbound, slow) from Britain to North America. The convoy was made up of 42 ships, of which 12 or 13 were sunk after the convoy came under sustained attack from German submarines hunting in packs. In the early morning of 5 May, Wentworth was south of Greenland and east of Newfoundland when it was hit by a torpedo fired by a U-boat, , under the command of Rolf Manke. Manke had sunk Bristol City not long before. The torpedo hit Wentworth on its port side, creating a hole in the hull that allowed the sea into the engine and boiler rooms.

Its projects engage people in activities promoting social justice. The organisation is funded primarily through donations and grants and has been awarded multiple national and international prizes for its projects. Goals The organisation's aim is to make socially conscious engagement attractive and visible to a broad public. It strives to raise awareness for social issues, get people engaged in social activism and provide solutions which do not instill pity. Projects The project Pfandtastisch helfen makes it possible for customers to donate their bottle recycling receipts at supermarkets. The funds raised from the receipts are donated to other nonprofit organisations throughout Germany. The food bank in Berlin, Berliner Tafel, for instance, was able to raise more than 100,000 euros per year in this way. The project Wheelmap.org is an online map for finding and marking wheelchair accessible places. Users can mark public places such as caf√©s, cinemas, stores and doctor's offices using a simple traffic light system, which indicates if a place is fully, partially or not at all wheelchair accessible.This Massive, Open Source Map Makes the World More Wheelchair Friendly, Gizmodo. The project gained national fame because of a Google Chrome TV advertisement featuring the map and its founder, Raul Krauthausen. The map is available in 22 languages on the website and as an iOS, Android (operating system) and Windows Phone app. In May 2012 Sozialhelden introduced the project BrokenLifts.org. The project‚Äôs aim is to create a central platform where users can inform themselves about the state of repair of elevators in public transportation systems. Starting in November 2011 information regarding malfunctioning elevators in the two transportation systems in Berlin was collected and analyzed hourly. On October 8, 2014 a revised version of the service was launched in cooperation with the public transportation providers Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg, the S-Bahn Berlin GmbH and the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe. Elevators in the system report their operational state to BrokenLifts.org and the malfunctioning elevators are shown on the website and app of the service. In addition, the broken elevators are also shown on the online schedule of the transportation providers. Currently the project is limited to the Berlin region, but a collection of data nationwide is envisioned. On August 16, 2012 the organisation published the project Leidmedien.de in cooperation with the Robert Bosch Stiftung. The project, which was developed together with several journalists, is directed at reporters and commentators who work for the press, in radio broadcasting or other media. It gives directions and support on what phrases and expressions to employ when writing about people with disabilities, without stigmatising them. The aim of the site is to raise the public‚Äôs awareness by making journalists consider the way language shapes our realities and thus has the power to represent people with disabilities in a realistic way, devoid of stereotypes. The project also gives a voice to people with a wide spectrum of disabilities, giving them a platform for perspectives that are rarely heard in the mainstream media. Sozialhelden emphasize that Leidmedien is not there to instruct journalists but rather to sensitise and change perspectives and give support in finding appropriate language.

The project aims to use the latest technologies to help the Mekong river region protect its vital ecosystem. It helps to connect USAID's development network with NASA's technology and satellite data to provide mapping information and satellite imagery. History The first such experimental hub was launched in Panama in 2005 to serve the near region. The project was initially undertaken by researchers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. In the Earth Observation Summit, 2007, SERVIR was recognized as a model for the effectuation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In 2010, the organisation had a presence in the Himalayas when a hub, SERVIR-Himalaya, was established at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Kathmandu, Nepal. The organization has launched similar projects in the past for other regions in Latin America, Africa and Asia. Target The project stresses the vital issues associated in the Mekong river basin region which encompasses all the five countries which are also known as the rice bowl of Asia. The project will also allow these countries to better deal with natural disasters and climate studies like green house gas emissions and its effects. It also enables them to use their water resources more efficiently. Geographical and strategical importance Mekong River Basin Area is about 5000km long The Mekong basin is covers almost from Tibetan plateau up to the South China Sea region. It gives livelihood to almost 40 million people. The environment is considered one of the most volatile ones in the world. The project uses space applications and helps to create geospatial data which is later analyzed to avoid natural disasters like floods and others in the lower Mekong region. Implementation The implementation of the project is undertaken by the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) in consortium with Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Spatial Informatics Group (SIG) and Deltares. The first phase of the project was launched on 31 August 2015. Future perspectives SERVIR-Mekong is an example of the technical collaboration in the region and development of a common analysis. It also aims to see environmental planning agencies leading in technical support and take better development decisions. SERVIR has also served in development of more than 30 countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia which includes providing tools and training to thousands of people of the region.

Overview The Brunei dollar is one of strongest currencies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, a factor discouraging tourists in the region from visiting Brunei. One Brunei dollar is equal to around 9,740 Indonesian rupiah, 2.8 Malaysian ringgit, 32.9 Philippine peso and 25.5 Thai baht. According to some travel agencies, because of Brunei's strong currency tour packages are expensive compared with those of other countries in the region; local tourists prefer other ASEAN countries, although tourists from outside the ASEAN prefer Brunei. In 2014, 95 percent of foreign tourists arrived in Brunei by land; four percent arrived by air, and one percent by sea. Government initiatives The Brunei government budgeted $300,000 for tourism in 2015, and provisions for tourism were also made in the country's National Development Plan (NDP). Brunei is seeking foreign direct investment in tourism and collaboration with a number of agencies. =Tutong Destination Programme= The Tutong Destination Programme is a pilot project to increase tourism in Tutong District, a major tourist destination in the country. The programme, created by the district government in collaboration with travel agencies and the NGOs, began in 2013. More than 2,000 tourists have visited Tutong (which has more than 30 potential tourist destinations) since the project was introduced. The district was visited by 50 delegates from the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP- EAGA). =Bird Watching Workshop 2015= Birdwatching is one aspect of nature tourism identified in the Brunei Tourism Masterplan. In 2015, a three-day birdwatching workshop was sponsored by the Tourism Development Department of Brunei in collaboration with Sunshine Borneo Tours and Travel, the Malaysian Nature Society (MNS), the Birding Conservation Council (BCC) and volunteers from the Brunei Birders Group. Recommendations Islam is the state religion of Brunei, and tourists should observe Islamic etiquette. Women should dress modestly in conservative and rural areas. During the month of Ramadan, visitors are not permitted to drink or eat during the day in public areas. Most major tourist attractions in Brunei are Islamic mosques. Foreign, non- Muslim tourists in proper attire may enter mosques; women should cover their head, shoulders and knees. Although the sale of alcohol is prohibited in Brunei, non-Muslims over age 17 may bring two bottles of liquor or wine and 12 cans of beer into the country; 48 hours must elapse between each importation.

She was the daughter of Edward Ernest Villiers (1806‚Äì1843) and Elizabeth Charlotte Liddell. She was the granddaughter of George Villiers, and the niece of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon. The Pre-Raphaelite portrait of her by George Frederic Watts was painted when she was 21. She was then the only unmarried daughter as her twin sister Elizabeth had married Henry Loch, 1st Baron Loch in 1862. (There is a tale that Henry proposed to the wrong girl by mistake and then refused to admit it.) Edith was living with her widowed mother at the home of her uncle, the Earl of Clarendon. She had been trained in dancing, music and art, but she had not received a structured education. Villiers married Robert Bulwer-Lytton (later 1st Earl of Lytton) on 4 October 1864.

Robert, an aspiring diplomat, was relatively poor for a member of the British upper classes, although his father Edward Bulwer- Lytton was a well-known writer and was raised to the peerage in 1866. His father controlled his son and it was his choice for his son to become a diplomat. Having previously broken up a match between Robert and another girl, he also disapproved of the marriage to Edith. For the first year he refused to speak to her but eventually warmed to the marriage. Edith accompanied her husband during his diplomatic career, and several of their children were born abroad.

The following year Edith, as Vicereine, was invested in the Imperial Order of the Crown of India. Edith was also decorated with the honorific Lady, Royal Order of Victoria and Albert. Edith and her daughters restyled the court which they considered inferior to the courts of Europe. Fashions were ordered from Paris.

History  The Shipstern Conservation & Management Area, formerly known as Shipstern Nature Reserve, was officially opened by the Minister of Natural Resources in September 1990. Long recognized as being of the more important private protected areas due its geographic position and its biodiversity, it has appeared on official maps ever since its inception. In 2012, the Corozal Sustainable Future Initiative entered the reserve into a trust in perpetuity, whereby on the one hand the owner CSFI commits to manage the reserve as an IUCN Category II national park, and the Government of Belize, on the other hand, has included Shipstern C&MA; in the National Protected Area System of Belize.

He created (at what today still is the headquarters of the protected area) a butterfly production centre designed to supply various butterfly exhibits in the United Kingdom. In 1989, unable to sustain further the costs of maintaining and protecting such a large area, he sold the land to the freshly created International Tropical Conservation Fund.ITCF.

In 2012, the Corozal Sustainable Future Initiative proposed to the Government of Belize to help manage the Honey Camp National Park and the Freshwater Creek Forest Reserve, two contiguous protected areas located to the South West of Shipstern, both at risk or in the process of witnessing illegal agricultural encroachment. In 2013, CSFI and the Government of Belize signed co-managements agreement for both areas. In terms of management, CSFI has a three-pronged approach, namely conservation, tourism and sustainable forest management.

Shipstern harbours several types of forests, the most noteworthy being the Yucatan semi- deciduous medium-sized forest (following Mexican terminology) and the Pseudophoenix Palm dry coastal forest. This latter forest type has a very limited range not only in Belize bit also on the Yucatan Peninsula, while also having a very patchy distribution. Forests in Shipstern are still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Janet in 1955. Although still secondary in stature, the forests within Shipstern have been regenerating with hardly any disturbance since Hurricane Janet. In view of the widespread deforestation and degradation of forests in northeastern Belize over the past three decades, these forest certainly now rank among the most pristine still to be found in this part of the country.  Fauna  Until recent years, fauna was still abundant in northeastern Belize, not only thanks to the large extent of forests, but also thanks to the fact that the Shipstern area was long isolated and only really reachable by sea, However, deforestation in recent decades and particularly since 2005 has affected wildlife. Shipstern as well as the other protected areas managed by CSFI have become the last refuges for fauna in the northeastern part of Belize. In Shipstern, fauna is still very diverse, with almost 300 species of birds, among which many Yucatan endemics, as well as many species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians. = Mammals = All five cat species of Belize (jaguar, puma, ocelot, margay & jaguarundi) occur and are still fairly regularly seen. Other mammals include two species of peccaries, two species of deer, tayra, white-nosed coatis, Yucatan squirrel, Mexican anteaters, the endangered Baird's tapir, among many other small mammals, including 22 species of bats. Monkeys are no longer present, probably due to the devastating effects of Hurricane Janet in 1955. In recent years, a small population of 21 black howler monkeys (in Belize commonly known as baboon) was reintroduced in the Shipstern forest.Wildtracks. Wildtracks Blog. Retrieved 2015-11-02. = Birds = Thanks to its variety of habitats and its geographic position between the drier Yucatan and more humid Central American forests types, Shipstern hosts a large number of bird species, many of which are Yucatan endemics and can, in Belize, only be seen in Shipstern. Extensive research has shown that close to 300 species inhabit the area, among which the keel-billed toucan, the lineated woodpecker or the Yucatan jay (in Belize commonly known as Yucatan blue jay). In 1992, the American woodstorks returned as a breeding species to Shipstern Lagoon, and specific conservation measures were implemented to protect colonies. Over the years, these reached up to several hundred birds, but recently breeding has become erratic, which may be linked to water level fluctuations caused by human activities. Shipstern is the only known mainland habitat of the black catbird. = Reptiles and amphibians = 78 different species of reptiles and amphibians have been documented in Shipstern Conservation & Management Area. They include salamanders, frogs, toad, iguanas, snakes and the Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii). Due to overharvesting, the Mexican musk turtle (Staurotypus triporcatus) has probably disappeared from the area. Other turtles, among which the scorpion mud turtle (Kinosternon scorpioides), the furrowed wood turtle (Rhinoclemmys areolata) or the white-lipped mud turtle (Kinosternon leucostomum), are still fairly common. = Fish = The aquatic systems of Shipstern also consist in a mosaic of many habitats, differentiated by their permanent or temporary status, as well as salinity. Many species of fish seem to show high degrees of adaptability to either fresh or saline water. In forest pools, species typical of flowing streams are found, which suggest a vast underground aquifer connectivity. The critically endangered sawfish, of which several unconfirmed sightings have been reported, is most certainly extinct in the Shipstern Lagoon. = Arthropods = 122 different butterfly species belonging to swallowtails (Papilionidae), whites (Pierinae) and brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae) have been recorded. A further 21 different grossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae) and 51 skipper butterflies (Hesperiidae) were also documented over the years. Estimates put the number of species of butterflies at 300 of which around 10% are, in Belize, only to be found in the area. Adult butterfly diversity seems to be highest at the onset of the dry season, early in the year. Another peak seems to occur in August, during the small dry season.  Hawk-moth  49 different hawk-moths have been identified in the area. Some, like Manduca wellingi, are common for the drier Yucatan vegetation types, while others, like Agrius cingulata or Xylophanes tersa inhabit the tropical rainforest within Shipstern.  Silk moths  16 species of silk moths were recorded, most of them belonging to the families Ceratocampinae and Hemileucinae. Members of Arsenurinae and Saturniinae sub-families have also been documented, but they seem less common.  Odonata  A total number of 54 different dragonflies (Zygoptera) and damselflies (Zygoptera) were recorded for the Shipstern Conservation & Management Area.

During his time in Virginia Cheeseman served on the Virginia House of Burgesses and the Governor's council. Little is known about Cheeseman's early life but it is believed that he was born around 1598, in England. He traveled to Virginia in 1621 and settled in what eventually became Elizabeth City County, Virginia. Historical records show that Cheeseman was likely the same John Cheeseman that married Anne Willett in 1616 and it is known that he took a wife named Margaret, with whom they had at least one child. While in Virginia Cheeseman acquired multiple acres of land and built a plantation. He was appointed a county justice and was made a captain of the militia. By April 1652 he was appointed lieutenant colonel. Cheeseman was also appointed to the House of Burgesses and was present at the first meeting that the burgesses and Council members met separately on March 2, 1643. Cheeseman eventually returned to England, where he and his wife lived in Surrey. His exact date of death is unknown, but Cheeseman wrote a new will in December 1663 and on May 2, 1665 his will was proved valid in the prerogative court of Canterbury.

Life He was born the son of Richard Tylden of Milsted Manor, Kent by his second wife, Jane, daughter of the Reverend Dr. Samuel Auchmuty and brother of Samuel on 8 April 1790. Sir John Maxwell Tylden was his elder brother. After passing through the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich at Woolwich, London, Tylden received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 6 November 1806, and was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 May 1807. He embarked for Gibraltar on 8 January 1808, arriving on 10 March, and was employed in the revision of the fortifications. In September 1811 he went to Malta, and thence, at the end of October, to Messina. He was promoted to be second captain on 15 April 1812. Tylden was commanding royal engineer, under Lord William Bentinck, at the siege of Santa Maria in the Gulf of Spezzia, and at its capture on 29 March 1814, and was thanked in general orders for his exertions. He was mentioned in despatches and Admiral Rowley expressed his indebtedness to him for assistance to the navy at the batteries. Tylden was also commanding royal engineer of the Anglo-Sicilian army under Bentinck at the action before Genoa on 17 April, when the French were defeated, and he took part in the investment of the city and the operations which led to the surrender of the fortress on 19 April 1814. He was thanked in general orders, mentioned in despatches (London Gazette, 8 May 1814), and on 23 June received promotion for his services to the brevet rank of major. He was also appointed military secretary to Bentinck, commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, and occupied the post until his return to England in August. In November 1814 Tylden joined the army in the Netherlands, and took charge of the defences of Antwerp. In 1815 he organised and commanded a train of eighty pontoons, with which he took part in the operations of the allies, the march to and capture of Paris, and the occupation of France. He returned to England in 1818. In June 1822 he went again to Gibraltar, and served there as second in command of the royal engineers until May 1823, when he returned to England, and was stationed at Portsmouth. He was promoted to be first captain in the royal engineers on 23 March 1825. In November 1830 he was appointed commanding royal engineer at Bermuda. He returned home in July 1836, and was commanding royal engineer of the eastern military district, with headquarters at Harwich. He was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel of royal engineers on 10 January 1837. In May 1840 he went to Malta as commanding royal engineer, returning to England in October 1844, when he was appointed commanding royal engineer of the south-eastern military district and stationed at Dover. He was promoted to be colonel of royal engineers on 21 Sept. 1850, having arrived at Corfu in June of that year as commanding royal engineer in the Ionian Islands. =Crimea= From Corfu Tylden was sent in February 1854 to join the army in the east. He arrived at Constantinople on the 12th of that month, and on the 21st was made a brigadier-general on Lord Raglan‚Äôs staff and commanding royal engineer of the army. He was busy until May with the defences of the lines of Gallipoli. On the change of base from Gallipoli to Varna, Tylden went there, and when the Russians raised the Siege of Silistra in the middle of June, and it was decided to invade the Crimea, he prepared the necessary works for embarking and disembarking the army and its munitions of war, and collected siege materials. On the occasion of the great fire at Varna on 10 August Tylden was chiefly instrumental in saving the town from entire destruction by protecting two large gun¬¨powder magazines with wet blankets when the fire had reached within thirty yards of them. Tylden proceeded to the Crimea with the army, and took part in the Battle of the Alma on 20 September 1854. Lord Raglan in his despatch referred to him as being ‚Äòalways at hand to carry out any service I might direct him to undertake.‚Äô He was taken ill with virulent cholera on the night of 21 September, and died on the evening of the 22nd. He was buried in a vineyard before the army marched on the morning of the 23rd. In the orders issued on the occasion it was stated that ‚Äòno officer was ever more regretted, and deservedly so.‚Äô It was announced in the London Gazette of 5 July 1855 that, had Tylden survived, he would have been made a knight commander of the Bath, and in the Gazette of 8 September 1856 his widow was authorised to bear the same style as if her husband had been duly invested with the insignia. Family Tylden married first, at Harrietsham, Kent, on 20 August 1817, Lecilina, eldest daughter of William Baldwin of Stedehill, Kent; and secondly, at Dover on 20 February 1851, Mary, widow of Captain J. H. Baldwin, and eldest daughter of the Reverend S. Dineley Goodyar, rector of Otterden, Kent. He had two sons by his first wife, William, curate of Stanford, Kent, and Richard Tylden (1819‚Äì1855) who followed his father into the Royal Engineers and was on his staff in Crimea. The other son, the Reverend Richard, became curate of Stanford, Kent.

History of term  Essays in Lib√©ration and France 24 on the history of this term do not claim to find the definitive origin of this term, rather, both publications trace the term as far back as a 2002 use in New Judeophobia, a book by Pierre-Andr√© Taguieff, historian of ideas, who describes Islamo- fascism as a type of anti-Zionism popular among \\"the new third-worldist, neo- communist and neo-leftist configuration, better known as the 'anti- globalization movement\\". Interviewed in 2016 by Liberation journalists Sonya Faure and Frantz Durupt, Taguieff is not certain whether he coined it or had heard it used, but he points out that the phrases Islamo-progressives and in the 1980s Palestino-progressives were used as self-descriptions by the French left. According to Alain Badiou and Eric Hazan, Islamo-leftists was coined by French police for reasons of simple utility. Al Jazeera claims that the term Islamo-leftism was coined by Marine Le Pen, who uses it \\"to describe what she considers an unhealthy alliance between \\"Islamist fanatics\\" and the French Left\\".  Definitions  French philosopher Pascal Bruckner understands Islamo-leftism as \\"the fusion between the atheist Far Left and religious radicalism\\". According to Bruckner, Islamo-leftism was \\"chiefly\\" conceived by British Trotskyites of the Socialist Workers Party. Because these dedicated leftists perceive Islam's potential for fomenting societal unrest, they promote tactical, temporary alliances with reactionary Muslim parties. According to Bruckner, leftist adherents of Third-Worldism hope to use Islamism as a \\"battering-ram\\" to bring about the downfall of free-market capitalism and see the sacrifice of individual rights, in particular of women's rights, as an acceptable trade-off in service of the greater goal of destroying capitalism. Bruckner contends that Islamists, for their part, pretend to join the left in its opposition to racism, neocolonialism and globalization as a tactical and temporary means to achieve their true goal of imposing the \\"totalitarian theocracy\\" of Islamist government. Political scientist Maurice Fraser regards Islamo-leftism as part of a \\"striking and recent abdication of the Enlightenment project of human rights, freedom, secularism, science and progress\\" on the part of the political left, particularly among the anti-globalization activists of the New Left. Bernard- Henri L√©vy has described \\"Islamo-leftism\\" as \\"this grand new alliance between the reds and the new browns, of the axis which runs from Le Monde diplomatique to the death squads\\" and as a sort of \\"anti-American religion\\". According to Mark Silinsky of the United States Army War College, Islamo-leftism is alliance of Islamists and leftists in opposition to Western values that can also be also referred to as the \\"red-green axis\\". Silinsky characterizes the black-green alliance between Black Lives Matter and the Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations as an example of Islamo-leftism. According to Robert S. Wistrich, \\"[a] poisonous anti-Jewish legacy can be found in Marx, Fourier, and Proudhon, extending through the orthodox Communists and \\"non- conformist\\" Trotskyists to the Islamo-Leftist hybrids of today who [are allied with] the Islamist anti-Semites of Hamas\\". Alvin Hirsch Rosenfeld describes Islamo Leftism as \\"the hope, entertained by a revolutionary fringe, of seeing Islam become the spearhead of a new insurrection, engaged in a 'Holy War against global capitalism\\". = \\"Islamo-leftism\\" in Iran = Shireen Hunter credits Mahmoud Taleghani's reinterpretation of Islam in the light of Marxist theory in the 1970s with inspiring the \\"Islamo-leftist\\" group Mujahaedin-e- Khalq. According to Hunter, one of the goals of Islamo-leftism in the Muslim world during that period was to combat the left by borrowing parts of its platform, thus hoping to attract economically disadvantaged groups like the Shia to Islamic politics. The result of these developments was the left-wing \\"radicalization of Islam\\" and \\"the emergence of what could be described as a leftist Islam\\". Hunter describes the way in which \\"Islamo-leftist intellectuals (the Mujahedin e Khalq) and Islamo-liberal intellectuals (the Islamic wing of the National Front and later the Freedom Movement) also directed anti-Pahlavi activities\\" which included guerrilla warfare. Frictions later between the various Islamic groups that had participated in the Iranian Revolution, with Morteza Motahhari, a socially progressive ally of Ruhollah Khomeini, being assassinated by an Islamo-leftist followers of Ali Shariati. According to Olivier Roy, the three major Iranian political groups‚Äîleftist, Islamist and Islamo-leftist‚Äîactive in the 1970s had revolutionary rather than liberal democratic ideologies.  Use in fiction  In his 2015 novel, Submission, Michel Houellebecq has Robert Rediger, the fictional character who is a convert to Islam and university professor turned politician, describe Islamo-leftism as \\"a desperate attempt by moldering, putrefying, brain-dead Marxists to hoist themselves out of the dustbin of history by latching onto the coattails of Islam\\".

She is also an assistant professor of Department of Chinese Literature at the National Tsing Hua University. Yang sees Lu Xun, Zhang Ai-ling and Yang Mu as the influences of her writings. Yang is regarded as an iconic poet of the cyber-age. Her works, including The Civilization of Holding One‚Äôs Breath and Sea Breeze and Sparks, are described as incorporating classical concepts and modern perceptions. Yang was also the youngest poet to be included in the Comprehensive Anthology of Contemporary Chinese Literature in Taiwan(Vol. 2), and the youngest entrant of the Thirty Years of Elite Taiwan Literature: Thirty New Poets.  Biography  = Early life and education = Born in 1978, Yang Chia-hsien experienced Taiwan's transition from a militarized society to a democratic, free society after the lifting of martial law in 1987 when she was a child. Yang was born and raised in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan. Her life in Kaohsiung is mentioned in some of her works and interviews. In her prose The Flowing Room, Yang writes about her teenage and her family; Yang and her younger sister lived with their parents in an apartment, but her parents divorced when she was studying at university. In her school days, Yang immersed herself in the classical Song Poetry, as well as modernist poetry such as the works of Xi Murong and Chen Yizhi. These works have great influence on Yang's poetry. She was also the editor of the school newspaper in high school. She moved to Taipei when she was eighteen to attend the National Chengchi University. After earning the BA in Chinese degree, Yang continued to study towards her master and PhD in Chinese degrees at the National Taiwan University. = Career = Yang started writing when she was in high school. Although she won the first prize of the poetry category in the writing contest held by her school, her early works were mostly prose. She started creating a large amount of poems when she was at university. The popularization of the Internet from late 1990s to early 2000s provided her with the platform to share her works with the world. Yang frequently posted her works on poetry BBS and her blog, from 1998 to 2002, she has published around 230 poems and 90 prose online. Since the establishment in 1998, in three years' time her blog had been viewed for over 260 thousand times, which made Yang an internet self-publishing celebrity and pioneer in Taiwan. In 2003, Yang published her first poetry collection, The Civilization of Holding One‚Äôs Breath; the next year she published her first prose collection, Sea Breeze and Sparks. After getting her PhD degree, Yang works as an assistant professor of the Chinese Literature Department at the National Tsing Hua University. She has published various critical article and research books of contemporary Chinese and Taiwanese literature. To promote Chinese and Taiwanese literature and poetry, Yang occasionally gives lectures at different literary events. Also, she has been one of the curators of the Taipei Poetry Festival since 2011.  Writing style  Yang's prose place great emphasis on the exploration of space and the expression of love and pain. They also discuss fashion trends and consumerism in modern city life in a calm style and with an occasional poetic form. Yang's poems are written in classical structure, but the transformation of the shape, sound or meaning of words exhibits modern images and content. Her poetry has been commented by Yang Mu as ‚Äúextensively creating a variety of ever-changing realms and emotions, and boldly utilizing traditional literary allusions.‚Äù Tang Juan-ping, a reputable Taiwanese poet and critic, also points out that, ‚Äúwhen the lines carry on, the soul promotes a kind of classical concept, while the body bursts forth with a kind of modern perception. These two aspects often create paradoxes, wrestling with each other and forming a unique style.‚Äù Also, her poetry is described as presenting to readers \\"a world of emotional expression, a world of pure expression; drama and narration play a lesser role.‚Äù The foundation of her aesthetics, ‚Äúcan be described in a general sense as modernism, while its spirit merges Western symbolism with high modernism.‚Äù  Awards  * 2003: National Student's Literature Award, Quality Award of Degree level(Poetry), Â§ßÊ∞¥‰πãÂ§úÁ≠â‰∏âÈ¶ñ\\"The Night of Flood and Three Other Poems\\" * 2004: Taipei Literature Award, Annual Prize, ÊàëÁöÑÊ∫´Â∑ûË°ó, ÂèäÂÖ∂‰ªñ \\"My Wenzhou Street, and Other Stories\\"  Works  Yang Chia-hsien's works include prose, poetry, non-fictions, compilations, and critical essays.

They are attested from the medieval period, claiming descent from the oldest son of Emperor Montoku, Prince Koretage (844‚Äì897), whom they credit with the invention of the wood lathe (rokuro). Originally the kijiya occupied the more populous parts of central and southern Japan and are said to originate from a single village, Higashi- Ogura, in Kanzaki District, Shiga Prefecture, leading them to take on the surname, \\"Ogura\\". As migrant minority group they moved about in groups of a few families, collecting wood in the mountains. Contact between these groups was achieved through two shrines, enshrining the legendary princely ancestor. Shrine officials traveled through the country, collecting contributions and handing out licenses for collecting wood and for pursuing their profession. In 1872, 1536 families were managed by one of these shrines. In the course of the Meiji Restoration the kijiya lost the right to collect wood and had to abandon their migratory lifestyle, settling in villages where they worked in furniture or lacquerware producing companies, or became farmers or charcoal makers. As late as 1939, small kijiya communities were reported in Fukushima Prefecture, though it is assumed that only individuals of these groups survive today, mainly in mountains and villages of Tohoku.

Along with the Korean National Council of Women (KNCW), KWAU helps coordinate non-governmental organization activities dealing with women's issues and feminism throughout Korea.  History  The KWAU was founded in February 1987. It was made up of left-wing, pro-labor feminists in the wake of the sexual assault charges brought by Kwon In Suk against the Korean government. The women involved were a diverse group of blue-collar workers, clerical workers, professionals, housewives, college students, rural women and poor women living in cities. KWAU was also connected to the minjung movement and the national democratic movement. This period involved a focus on women's rights. This focus included an emphasis on a few areas in the fight against inequality including lifelong equal work, the protection of maternity, sexual violence as the violation of human rights, and the pacifism of women. Initially, there were 21 organizations who came together to create KWAU. Some of the original organizations of KWAU included the Women's Society for Democracy, the Korea Women's Hot Line, the Women's Newspaper (now the Women's News), Korean Women Workers Association, Korean Catholic Farmers, Women's Committee and others. KWAU directly opposed the military Jun government and participated in the struggle against these forces which it saw as leading the country in a wrongful manner. KWAU was significant in that it, unlike other women's groups in Korea at the time, took an \\"oppositional stance toward the repressive state\\" run by Chun Doo-hwan. The minjung social movement ultimately led to direct elections and the resignation of President Chun Doo-hwan of which KWAU is largely credited for its role and participation in this movement allowing for success. KWAU helped the individual organizations under its umbrella to obtain financial support, conducted meetings on behalf of the groups and organized leadership training. KWAU worked to not only bring women on an equal footing with men, but also worked to transform the social structures which were oppressive to women. KWAU helped promote maternity leave, childcare issues and equal pay for equal work. This was done in various ways some of which included demanding the reevaluation of the protection of maternity and working to convince the public of the protection of maternity being a problem of labor to appeal to a wide range of people for support. KWAU was also active in addressing sexual violence against women. In April 1992, KWAU established a Special Committee for the Legislation of a Special Law against Sexual Violence. This led to the government announcing \\"substantial proposals against sexual violence including legislation of a special law.\\" Between 1992 and 1993, KWAU focused on developing a large social campaign calling for the abolition of sexual violence of women in society. In addition, KWAU formed an alliance of concerned women corresponding with the presidential election during this time. This alliance encouraged presidential candidates to incorporate the enactment of a sexual violence protection law into their campaign platforms. KWAU can be credited with advocating for the amendment of the \\"Sexual Equality Employment Act,\\" the enactment of the \\"Infant Care Act,\\" the defense against the abolition of menstruation leave, and resistance to the enactment of the \\"Act on Worker Dispatch System.\\" By the mid-1990s, the women's movement was largely focused on advancing its agenda through a \\"woman's perspective\\" of viewing society. In 1994, KWAU shifted its objectives slightly and worked to promote the cooperation between women's organizations in an effort to create unity. Women's welfare also saw an increased role in the goals of KWAU during this time. The strategies utilized to further these objectives included lobbying for the passage and improvement of laws and institutions that promoted women's rights and interests, implementing programs for women's welfare and female workers in general, and advocating for certain programs that enhanced national unification. KWAU also placed focus on women's participation and representation in local politics. By 1995, the organization had helped to significantly increase women's participation in politics through recruiting and promoting female candidates; 14 out of 17 of which were elected that year. Also in 1995, KWAU was granted legal status by the government. With the election of President Roh Moo-Hyun in December 2002, KWAU saw a new opportunity to further women's causes and empowerment. A few of the new administration's key national priorities included advocating for the \\"realization of a society with gender equality\\" and \\"the abolition of the family-head system.\\" Along with these tasks, the Roh Moo-Hyun administration focused on the necessity and importance of active participation of civil society and often recruited from some of the main supportive organizations when seeking nominees for appointment to significant government positions. In this process, Chi Eun-hee, the then President of KWAU resigned her position to join the administration ultimately becoming the Minister of Gender Equality. This appointment allowed Chi Eun-hee to implement the feminist agenda in close consultation with active members in KWAU at the time. Another example of this increased influence was Han Myeong-sook, who was a past president of KWAU and was appointed Minister of the Environment.

He is the former head chef of the three Michelin star restaurant Le Jardin des Sens in France. He is known for his \\"Octo-philosophy\\" of eight elements which make up his dishes. In 2017, his Michelin 2-star eponymous Restaurant Andr√© was named the Best Restaurant in Singapore, and the second- best in Asia by Restaurant magazine. Early life Andr√© Chiang was born in Taiwan, but spent his early life in Japan where he learnt to cook from his mother. He initially expected to follow her into the family business and eventually take over but found that his imagination exceeded those bounds and wanted to learn the food of other cuisines. He specifically wanted to learn French cuisine because he felt that it was most unobtainable. Culinary career Chiang moved to France, initially expecting to stay for a short period and return to Asia. Instead, he spent the next fifteen years living there having gained a position at the three Michelin star restaurant Le Jardin des Sens run by Jacques and Laurent Pourcel despite Chiang not speaking any French at the time. Over the course of the next nine years, Chiang worked his way up through the kitchen to the position of chef de cuisine. During his time in France, he also spent time in the kitchens of La Maison Troisgros, L'Atelier de Jo√´l Robuchon and Restaurant Pierre Gagnaire. After his time in France, Chiang took a position at the Maia Luxury Resort in the Seychelles, a move that he later credited with allowing him to discover his own style of cooking, a pursuit he felt had gotten lost during his work in French restaurants. It was during this time that he developed his \\"Octo-philosophy\\" of preparing dishes, which he describes as the eight elements of \\"pure, salt, artisan, south, texture, unique, memory and terroir\\". He described the meaning of pure as presenting the dish without seasoning, but allowing each item on the plate to naturally complement each other. While the rest of his dishes have evolved over time, Chiang keeps one dish, entitled \\"Memory\\", the same as when he first created it in 1997. It is a warmed foie gras jelly served with a black truffle coulis. Chiang has called this a \\"pure Andr√© dish\\", having been the first dish he developed on his own. In 2008, he opened Jaan par Andr√© at the Swiss√¥tel The Stamford in Singapore, and after 18 months at the restaurant it was placed at the 39th spot in the overall list of The World's 50 Best Restaurants. He closed the restaurant in 2010 to move out of the hotel and open Restaurant Andr√© in the Bukit Pasoh area of Singapore. At his self-titled restaurant, he and his team create a menu on a daily basis depending on the quality of produce available in the markets, crediting this for making both him and his team think about the courses and the techniques that they can use. In 2014, Chiang opened the restaurant RAW in Taipei, Taiwan. Awards During his time at his restaurant Jaan par Andr√©, Chiang was named the Rising Chef of the Year for 2009 at the World Gourmet Summit Awards of Excellence. Restaurant Andr√© has placed in the top 10 in Restaurant magazine's list of the top 50 restaurants in Asia since 2013, *2013 *2014 *2015 *2016 and was named the best restaurant in Singapore and the second-best restaurant in Asia in 2017. His Taipei restaurant RAW was named the best restaurant in Taiwan and ranked number 24 in Asia in the same list.

He was member of several committees and advisory groups on management of natural resources, population growth, the environment and conservation. Through his career he placed emphasis on the need of a sustainable management of the natural resources. A key element of Ackerman thinking is the concept of system and the interactions between the people and the nature. According to Ackerman \\"the objective of Geography is to understand the great system that encompasses the humanity and its environment on Earth's surface\\".White, G. F. (1974), Edward A.

Patton, Geographical Review Vol. 64, No. 1 (Jan., 1974), pp. 150-153, Published by: American Geographical Society Biography Ackerman was born in Ohio and was an orphan. He attended Coeur D‚ÄôAlene Highschool, in 1930 he was awarded a scholarship to study at Harvard University. During his first term at Harvard his talent was noted by Derwent Whittlesey then the professor of Humane Geography in the Geology and Geography Department at Harvard. Whittlesey became his professor, mentor and promoter, and supervised Ackerman PhD. thesis which he completed in 1939. Upon graduating Ackerman was teacher at Harvard during the period 1940 - 1948. During the Second World War, Ackerman was contracted by the Coordinator Of Information (COI), a dependency that would be the origin of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) (that latter would be the origin of the CIA).Reconstructing Conflict: Integrating War and Post-war Geographies - S. Kirsch C. Flint, Chapter 11 Mapping Intelligence, American Geographers and the Office of Strategic Services and GHQ/SCAP (Tokyo), Trevor Barnes and Jeremy Crampton. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2011.330 pages. From this post he collaborated with the military effort, initially working in the Geographic Report Section of the Geography Division. Ackerman was responsible for planning and managing the drafting of documents that provided intelligence information on the different geographic areas where the war was taking place, including the assessment of beaches for disembarkments, and even the level of empathy and political and social preferences of the people living in the places where the US Army would be moving through. In 1942 ha was appointed Manager of OSS Topographic Intelligence subdivision of the Europe-African Division. The Geographic Reports he helped to produce, were later the base of what would be the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Surveys (JANIS) and latter would become the source material for the CIA World Factbook. After Japan was occupied by US in September 1945, Ackerman was commissioned to develop the policies for the development and management of Japan resources; he work on this assignment between 1946 - 1948 as member of the Natural Resources Section (NRS). Among the tasks undertaken by the NRS was the redistribution of the agricultural land, given that up to late 1945 Japan's agriculture system was essential a feudal one, with the poor peasants paying a fee for the land they laboured. A third of the agricultural land changed hands as a result of the implementation of the redistribution policy. In the period 1952 - 1954 he was vice general director of the Tennessee Valley Authority, being the director of the programme \\"Hydric Resources for the Future\\" (1954 - 1958).

The site puts a comedic spin on current news topics and broader social observations. The site is based in inner Sydney, but takes its name from the deserted regional town of Betoota, Queensland, and purports to be \\"Australia's oldest newspaper\\".  History  = Origins = The site was started in 2014 by journalists Archer Hamilton and Charles Single, who began working on the idea for The Betoota Advocate after meeting publisher Piers Grove through their work in the media industry. Single, formerly a writer for The Canberra Times, had lost his job in a wave of redundancies at the newspaper, and Hamilton had become disillusioned working in political campaigning for NGOs following a short stint at Hill FM as a newsreader. The pair, who attended Charles Sturt University together, teamed up with Grove, an entrepreneur and executive producer of the ABC satirical news show The Roast, to create the site. The trio runs The Betoota Advocate in Alexandria, Sydney alongside their PR consultancy firm Three Rivers. Hamilton and Single both work as writers for the publication, operating under the pen-names Clancy Overell and Errol Parker‚Äîalter-egos for which they remain in character in nearly all public and media appearances. The idea for the site stems from an idea Hamilton originally had to create a conservative newspaper in his hometown of Mitchell, Queensland. Hamilton had grown up near Mitchell where his parents worked as graziers, before moving to Brisbane in the 1990s. Hamilton‚Äôs love for the oddities of living in a country town led to the idea‚Äôs transformation into a satirical publication. Single also hails from the country and worked as a jackaroo at Nockatunga Station in Queensland prior to starting university. = Growth in popularity = The Betoota Advocate has grown to be Australia's most popular satirical news site, garnering a larger readership within Australia than popular U.S. satire site The Onion and Australian site The Shovel. It places an emphasis on highlighting Australian youth culture and lampooning contemporary issues in a sarcastic manner, including through the use of slang and colloquialisms. Its growing readership base is driven largely via its presence on Facebook, where it boasts over 750,000 followers. The popularity and consequential virality of its posts is described by the pair as being a result of their ability to scan through the news and put their spin on the topics of the moment, with Single suggesting that the site seeks to \\"make the line between what's real and what's not even blurrier\\". Alongside its ordinary satirical posts, the website has also run video interviews with high-profile politicians, including former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and then Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, with Hamilton and Single taking on their alter- egos, Overell and Parker, in both. In 2016, the pair were involved in a controversial television ad for politician Bob Katter's re-election campaign, in which they appeared in character. = Business model = The Betoota Advocate is funded via advertising revenue and sponsored brand placements within articles. Through their PR firm Three Rivers, the trio work with brands that wish to be mentioned in articles but do not want to be formally associated with the controversial publication. In May 2017, the site moved into branded content when it released an advertisement via its Facebook page in which characters Overell and Parker endorse superannuation company Grow Super. In August 2017, it launched a similar campaign for Virgin Mobile. Products making use of the Betoota brand have also been launched. In October 2016, the site published a book, The Betoota Advocate Round-Up, consisting of a compilation of articles sourced from the website. In January 2017, the site teamed up with Sydney brewery Yulli's Brews to launch a branded line of beer, Betoota Bitter, to be made available at a number of pubs throughout Australia. The site aims to expand the beer's availability into regional towns that share an affinity with the broader Betoota Advocate brand. In September 2017, the beer was made available for purchase online in an effort to diversify the website's revenue streams. Controversies Several Betoota Advocate articles have been mistaken for real news items by major Australian media outlets. In November 2014, Weekend Today reported as fact a Betoota Advocate article about a Sydney city parking ranger who accidentally booked himself. In January 2015, Deadspin reported that the 2016 Olympics would have 3-on-3 basketball, before realising that the source was a satire site. In March 2015, 4BC reported as fact a Betoota Advocate article about a 78-year-old man fighting off a home invasion. The website has also attracted criticism over the way it has portrayed certain individuals and organisations. In December 2014, the RSPCA Australia criticised the site for publishing an article announcing that it was trialling having veterinarians present at dog fights in Queensland without making it clear that the story was satire, as well as including made-up quotes attributed to them in the article. In October 2015, former Wallabies captain John Eales criticised The Betoota Advocate for an article attributing to him a quote that referred to Australian-born fans of the All Blacks as being \\"worse than ISIS\\". In February 2017, Queensland MP Leanne Donaldson said that the site had \\"missed the mark\\" by making light of Bundaberg's problems with alcohol fuelled violence after it published an article suggesting that the town would be building a giant statue of a black eye.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been built by Pandyan ruler Harikesari Parakkirama Pandian during the 16th century, with later additions from Madurai Nayaks. Shiva is worshipped as Kasi Viswanathar and his consort Parvathi as Visalakshi. The temple was the scene of temple entry movement in 1899, followed by Sivakasi riots when 22 people were killed. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple is open from 6 am - 12 pm and 4 - 8:30 pm on all days except during new moon days when it is open the full day. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmostavam festival during the Tamil month of Vaiakasi (May - June) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend The first precinct As per Hindu legend, a Pandya king Harikesari Parakkirama Pandian wanted to construct a temple for Hindu god Shiva at Tenkasi and went to Kasi to bring a lingam, the most common iconic representation of Shiva in South India. While returning to his palace with the prized lingam, he rested under the grove of a vilva tree, the favourite tree of Shiva. When a cow carrying the lingam refused to move from the spot, the king realised that it was a divine wish of Shiva, and he placed the lingam in the place where the cow halted. The place where the \\"shivalingam brought from Kasi\\" was installed came to be known as Sivakasi. Since he brought the lingam from Kasi, it came to be known as Kasi Viswanathar temple. History Pillared hall leading to the sanctum Sivakasi was established during the early 15th century CE. Between 1428 and 1460, a Pandya king Harikesari Parakkirama Pandian ruled the southern part of Madurai region, comprising the modern day Sivakasi and it surroundings. Sivakasi was a part of Madurai region during the 16th century. Madurai became independent from Vijayanagar Empire in 1559 under the Nayaks and the temple started receiving gifts from the rulers of the dynasty. There are no indication of history of the temple after the Nayak rule ended in 1736 and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740 ‚Äì 1754), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725 ‚Äì 1764) in the middle of 18th century. In 1801, Madurai came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency. During the 1800s, Nadars, then aspiring business community, established their commercial base in the town. By the end of the 19th century, the Nadars‚Äô rapid rise as a business community lead to confrontation with the Maravars. The Nadars were denied entry to the temple and when they tried to enter in 1899, it led to a series of riots which became known as the Sivakasi riots. A total of 22 people were killed, as many as 800 houses and Big chariot in center of the city (used by temple during festival) were burnt during the riots. Eventually the riots came to an end after the intervention of the military in mid-July 1899. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture The temple is located in the Bazaar street, a busy business locality in Sivakasi. The temple has a three- tiered gopuram (temple tower). The temple has a pillared hall from the entrance leading to the flagstaff hall. The sanctum is located axial to the entrance facing east. The image of Kasi Viswanathar in the form of lingam is housed in the sanctum. The images of Vinayaka and Subramanya are located on either side of the hall leading to the sanctum. The shrine of Sivakami is located parallel to the sanctum facing East. There is a second flagstaff located axial to the Sivakami shrine and perpendicular to the flagstaff facing Viswanathar shrine. The right of the main entrance facing the Sivakami shrine is the temple water tank. There are smaller shrines of Ayyappa, Dakshinamurthy, Arumugar, Durga, Navagrahas and Nataraja in the precinct around the shrines of Kasi Viswanatha and Visalakshi. Festival temple tank The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:30 p.m., and Aravanai Pooja between 8:00 \\\\- 8:00 p.m. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.

Education Warmus holds a B.A. in art history from the University of Chicago in 1975 and was enrolled in the Masters in General Studies in the Humanities program in 1976. Career He is a Fellow at the Corning Museum of Glass where he was the curator of Modern Glass from 1978 to 1984 as well as the founding editor of the New Glass Review, and editor of Glass Quarterly magazine from 1986 to 1989.

As noted in \\"The Corning Museum of Glass: Notable Acquisitions 2016\\" (Corning: The Museum) p.54: \\"Warmus continues to be an important voice analyzing and evaluating contemporary glass. His journals chronicle the development of his theories, which predicted the end of the Studio Glass movement (1995) and posited \\"Glass Secessionism\\" with the artist Tim Tate (American, b. 1960). Warmus's philosophy of \\"Reticulate Aesthetics\\" considers the structure of art as a net or web, rather than a hierarchy.\\" His theory of reticulate aesthetics is outlined in \\"From a Tree to a Web,\\" American Craft, v.75, no.2, April/May 2015, pp.104-107. His observations about the end of the studio glass movement are in \\"The End?,\\" Glass Quarterly, no. 60, Fall 1995, pp.42-45. Critic and curator Lydia Matthews, writing in American Craft Inquiry (‚ÄúDaring to Dive Deeply: A Conversation about Craft Writing and Criticism‚Äù Volume One, Issue One, November 2016) observed that Warmus developed his theory of Reticulate Aesthetics partly as a response to the critical positions of Clement Greenberg: ‚ÄúTo address this expansive complexity in the contemporary craft scene, Warmus increasingly recognized that Greenberg‚Äôs focus on materiality and form alone no longer seemed viable. Inspired by the kind of embodied knowledge acquired through experiences as a scuba diver, he began to envision a new way of looking at craft ‚Äì one more akin to viewing the rich underwater world. He described this analytical viewpoint as ‚Äúreticulate,‚Äù which the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines as: ‚Äúgenetic recombination involving diverse interbreeding populations.‚Äù There is no judging ‚Äúgood,‚Äù ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù ‚Äúbest‚Äù when comparing an octopus, shark, and a coral, so why would you want to impose hierarchical critical criteria to ‚Äúspecies‚Äù in the craft world rather than seeing them as coexisting or hybridizing within a larger, more intricate ecosystem? Reticulate criticism proposes a more horizontal, weblike, and networked approach to writing about craft, one which recognizes that our field evolves organically over time, in response to specific environmental conditions.‚Äù In 2020 Warmus curated ‚ÄúVenice and American Studio Glass‚Äù with Tina Oldknow at the Stanze del Vetro Museum in Venice, exploring the profound impact of Venice on American Studio Glass artists, beginning in the 1960s.

Venice 1956) is an Italian academic, writer and translator. Biography Palandri graduated with a degree in Dramaturgy from the DAMS (The Disciplines of Art, Music and Theatre) school at the University of Bologna, where he studied with Gianni Celati, Giuliano Scabia and Umberto Eco. During the Movement of 1977 in Italy, he curated a book on Radio Alice, Fatti Nostri with Carlo Rovelli, Maurizio Torrealta and Claudio Piersanti. Palandri‚Äôs first novel, Boccalone, is also set in Bologna during this same timeframe. The novel was published in 1979 through L‚Äôerba voglio press, run by Elvio Fachinelli, and then republished various times by Feltrinelli and Bompiani. Palandri moved to London in 1980, where he worked as a language coach for the Royal Opera House and as a journalist (collaborating with RAI, the BBC and numerous newspapers). In 1993, Palandri was given a Writing Residency post at the University College (London). As of 2003, he also taught a semester each year at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.. He still holds the posts of Writer in Residence and Professor of Modern European Literature at the UCL. Palandri has given talks on literature at universities in South America, Russia, China and Taiwan. Palandri‚Äôs novels, articles and essays have appeared in multiple languages and have received numerous prizes (Fenice Europa, Dessi‚Äô, Mastronardi, etc.). In 2003, he was conferred the title of ‚ÄúCommendatore‚Äù in the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity for his cultural contributions by Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. =Publication History= After Boccalone, Palandri collaborated with Marco Bellocchio to write the script of the film Diavolo in Corpo (Devil in the Flesh) (1986). He then published six novels: Le pietre e il sale (English: Ages Apart) (1986), La via del ritorno (English: The Way Back) (1997), Le colpevoli ambiguita‚Äô di Herbert Markus (1997), Angela prende il volo (2000), L‚Äôaltra sera (English: The Other Evening) (2003), I fratelli minori (2010). In this cycle, reworked in a single narrative and published by Bompiani with the title \\"Le condizioni atmosferiche\\" (2020) such themes are explored as: ‚ÄúHistorical events and social changes of great importance: from the student movement of 1977, to political terrorism, to the fall of the Berlin Wall to the radical changes imposed on European society due to the global phenomenon of migration.‚Äù (1) Palandri has written short stories and other pieces published in newspapers and review journals, collected in large part in the volume Allegro fantastico (1993). Palandri has published two ballads in verse: La strega mia amica (English: Little Witch) (1986) and Orfeo a teatro (2007). Palandri has also translated into Italian works by Eudora Welty, Robert McLiam Wilson and the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith. =Critical Contributions= Pier (2005, on Pier Vittorio Tondelli) and Primo Levi (2011, on the Piedmont writer of the same name) are a monograph and an anthology respectively, with prefaces and commentaries which contextualize the corpus of work written concerning the two Italian authors. The volumes La deriva romantica (2002) and Flow (2011) are, instead, books with a very strong theoretical focus. They discuss, in large part, questions relative to style, to the process of textual generation and the generation of metaphors, which are attributed to an independent vitality, not rhetoric but dynamically linked to content, and which qualifies literature. Flow begins with this phrase: ‚ÄúPoems and novels are the metaphors by which reality is brought into focus‚Äù. A single conversational flow is articulated through literary surfaces, in expression, and in profundity, in an atemporal dimension which creates cracks in those surfaces, which gives rise to the invention that the work is the space itself. In this volume, observations made in 16 appunti sulle metafore are added onto theoretical articulation, observations published and elaborated on various times in different contributing contexts before being collected in La deriva romantica. Lectures on diverse subjects given by Palandri at various universities have been published and are available online. \\" Verso L'infinito\\" is a monograph on Giacomo Leopardi's poem. =Works= * Boccalone: storia vera piena di bugie, Milan: L‚Äôerba voglio, 1979; n. ed.

Choita River is a branch of Ichamati river. Choita River debouches into the Jamuna River in Gaighata. The length of the river is 40 km. The river is currently separated from the Ichamati river at the debouch and the river has lost its normal flow speed due to flooding. A wetland to the east side of village had been transformed into productive farmland. Agriculture made wealth, and wealth made Kharua Rajapur areas. Fish embankments are being constructed and fish are being cultivated by splitting the river bed, blocking the river flow. During summer, fish food is available in the river. A crocodile jaw was found at Kinarmath village while excavating this river. Farmers grow crops which they export to other states and many villagers travel to work outside the area. So fertile is the soil here that anyone who owns just a few acres can earn a decent living. Villagers grow enough rice for their own needs. Here the Choita is rich in wildlife. A combination of climatic change and hunting pressure has reduced many animals. The Chaita provided an abundance of food all kharua rajapurian waited in anticipation of an infusion from this artery of life. Every monsoon rains saturate the land and swell the river. Rajapurian built their civilization with the wealth generated by grain. This river is merged with another important river called Chalundia river in the Gaighata area. River flow The Choita River is part of the Ganges River system. The river is 40 km long and merges with the Jamuna River in Gaighata. The river crosses Gopalnagar, Talikhola, Khedaitala, Chaitapara, Kharua Rajapur , Kinarmath, Rampur, etc. in the way of flow. All these are associated with the agricultural activities of the land along the river. An influx of tide can be seen in the flow of the river from Gaighata to the northern part of the village of Kharua Rajapur. Floods The river produces floods every year during the monsoon season. Floods cause the river to overflow. On August to September 2000, a severe flood occurred on the banks of this river. This flood is known to the people of this region as the 2000 India‚ÄìBangladesh floods. The river was also flooded in 2010 and 2015. Every year, the crops gets destroyed by the floodwaters of the river. At present, the river is in demand for renovation. Biodiversity There are plenty of freshwater fish, such as Channa striata, Latta, Walking catfish, Horn, Kai stingaree, Nayana, Pakala, Grass carp, Rohu, Mrigal, Asian swamp eel, Swamp barb, Khalase, etc. Besides, aquatic birds such as Heron, Little cormorant, Openbill stork, Weavers are also found.

The most popular story is relating to Kuveni, who was the first consort of King Vijaya. According to that legend, Vijaya had to marry a princess from India in order to become the king of his new found kingdom (Sri Lanka).

He wrote it under the name of Andrew Moreton Esq., presented as a dissatisfied middle-class old man extremely concerned about the increase in criminality around the 1720s. As in other essays, such as Every-body‚Äôs Business, Is No-Body‚Äôs Business (1725), The Protestant Monastery (1726), Parochial Tyranny (1727) and Augusta Triumphans (1728), Moreton here inquiries into a range of different social and moral issues: the increase in highway robberies, the inefficiency of the night watch, the wicked trade of gin shops, and the \\"infestation\\" of prostitutes, beggars, and vagrants all around London. Moreton's declared intention is \\"to break up street-robbers, nest and egg\\", providing practical solutions for a reformation of the night watch, manners, places and even the theatre, reforms which would improve the quality of life. Defoe was particularly inclined to use pseudonyms, acquiring in this way the reputation as one of the most chameleon-like English writers. These multiple personalities allowed him to freely express his opinions on London's social and moral qualitiesWall C. 'Defoe and London', in Richetti J. (2008), The Cambridge Companion to Daniel Defoe, New York: Cambridge University Press, p.166. (not without an hint of criticizing humor), and at the same time to express a resolute sense of duty, felt to be an essential characteristic of the eighteenth-century English citizen.  Preface The pamphlet is dedicated to His Majesty, \\"the king of our hearts; the king of our wishes\\" George II and his Queen, Caroline, but copies were also presented to the Lords Spiritual, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Defoe had a long-lasting admiration for the House of Hanover and his address to King George as \\"a king naturalized to us, a king who loves us, a king whose person as well as mind, the whole hero appears\\" recalls his past worship of King William III. Defoe's schemes and social projects were actually obtaining a warm widespread approval in this period. In the preface Moreton goes beyond the complimentary introduction and pleas to be heard conventional in such pamphlets, but he skilfully turns it into an opportunity to make criticisms and level accusations. Firstly, he denounces the abuse of \\"the liberty of the press, that from a benefit it becomes an evil and demands immediate regulation\\". This probably refers to the anti-Walpole journal The Craftsman, accused of turning an instructive and effective means of communication into an instrument used to achieve personal interests and even spread slander and scandal. Secondly, Moreton expresses his indignation concerning the anonymous gentleman author of Discovery to Prevent Street Robberies, whom he accuses of having copied and even made money out of the schemes he had presented in his earlier pamphlet, Augusta Triumphans. Describing Second Thoughts as an amended and enlarged version of his previous plan for the City of London, Moreton is eager to stress that his proposals are \\"humbly offered for the public welfare\\", nevertheless he will \\"stand prepared for the sneers of those who despite everything and everybody but their dear selves\\". The Watch =\\"Decrepit, Superannuated Wretches\\"= A city of London watchman, drawn and engraved by John Bogle (1776)One critical issue addressed by Moreton in this pamphlet involves the night watch, a highly significant institution in the panorama of eighteenth-century London. As described by Moreton, the watchmen were \\"decrepit, superannuated wretches, with one foot in the grave and the other ready to follow\\" and therefore more suited to the Poor House than for patrolling of the streets: \\"so little terror they carry with them, that hardly thieves make a mere jest of them\\". He even supposes that some of them, discouraged by their low social status, might decide to make their fortunes by passing to the other side and enlarging the ranks of criminals. Along with many of his peers, Moreton believes that English society is completely at the mercy of a dramatic rise in numbers of street-robberies, burglaries, and house-breakings, crimes which are generating anxiety among all social classes in the capital. House-breaking especially seems to directly concerned the entire metropolis, including the more wealthy and fashionable parishes. Moreover, the latest changes of the urban surroundings have hardened the policing of the streets, especially with shops, taverns, coffee-houses, theatres, pleasure gardens, remaining open in the evening and such a large number of people moving around after dusk. In the early eighteenth-century London, the night watchman was indeed an old controversial figure (established for the first time in the 1285 Statute of Winchester), deeply-rooted in the belief that the individual citizen had to perform his social and moral duty for the well-being of the society. Hence, every London parish requested its householders to perform by rotation the watch-duty on an unpaid and amateur basis, from dusk until dawn, and with only a stick or an halberd as a weapon.Beattie J.M. (2001), Policing and punishment in London 1660‚Äì1750, Urban Crimes and the Limits of Terror, Oxford: Oxford University, Press, p.170, ; Tobias J.J. (1979), Crime and Police in England: 1700‚Äì1900, Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, p.33, Each watchman was assigned with a short length of street to patrol every hour, and he had to examine all suspicious characters from his assigned watch box (a sentry box with half- door). The performance of such duty took away a great amount of money and energy, so by the late seventeenth-century it grew up the practice to pay a substitute (often another parishioner) to take up your watch duty. The fact that this service had to be arranged locally by parish officers rose a great number of issues. Firstly, the only men willing to take on this job for a very small wage were those who had little prospect of some other employment, usually old men hired as an alternative to the poor law grant. Secondly, Moreton suggests that \\"parochial misapplication\\"Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.13. were commonplace around constables and beadles, appointed to collect the individual fee for the night-watch. They were often accused to spend as little as possible on hiring watchmen and pocket the difference as a recompense for the unpaid service they had performed. =Needed a reform?= Moreton proposes a pragmatic scheme (already in use in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields) for a more effective night watch. This should be \\"composed of stout able-bodied men\\",Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.12. arranged in a sufficient number, one every forty houses \\"for it is observable that a man can not well see distinctly beyond the extent of twenty houses in a row\\". To avoid any possible abuse or misapplication in the distribution of the public money, Moreton suggests that the watch should be elected and paid by the householders themselves through an arranged rating and collecting system, and their annual wage should be increased to 20 pound,In Parochial Tyranny (1727) Moreton affirms that a watchman is paid 6d. a night, too little to attract any good candidate. (Beattie, 2001, p.190). so that \\"a poor man, who with frugality may live decently thereon\\". Furthermore, watchmen should be adequately armed with firearms and swords in order to dispose of an efficient mean to prevent crime and to protect their person if needed. They should also be equipped with a lantern and a horn to sound the alarm. Although some kind of reform was obviously needed to contrast the criminal problems of the streets, nowadays critics believe that watchmen were actually vigorously engaged in catching offenders, and that their work might be concealed in the records because the official arrest would be recorded by the constable in charge of the watch. The Old Bailey Session Papers report many examples of watchmen being very capable and brave in confronting and arresting offenders.See: Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 7.2, 31 October 2015), September 1719, trial of Thomas Jones (t17190903-21); Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 7.2, 31 October 2015), April 1724, trial of John Winderam (t17240415-8); Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 7.2, 31 October 2015), May 1724, trial of Thomas Mobbs (t17240521-29); Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 7.2, 31 October 2015), July 1726, trial of Mary Blewit , alias Dickenson, alias Bowler (t17260711-34). Probably the statutory reward to be earned from the arrest of a street robber or a burglar was quite a good incentive, not to mention possible private gratuities and local rewards. Regardless, Moreton is sceptical about the honesty of watchmen, and he doubts about their suspicious close relation with the criminal underworld in different contemporary pamphlets.See Defoe D. (1727), Parochial Tyranny, or the Householder's Complaint, p.20. Watchmen also appear as the accused in the Old Bailey Session Papers under trials for murder and theft,See: Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 7.2, 31 October 2015), January 1723, trial of William Harris (t17230116-35); Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 7.2, 31 October 2015), January 1725, trial of John Hewlet (t17250115-8); Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 7.2, 31 October 2015), August 1725, trial of Richard Brecknell (t17250827-68). while the bribe they received from street prostitutes was quite common knowledge in eighteenth- century London. Reforming society =Prostitutes= A Fool and His Money Soon Parted (1790) by Cruikshank, Isaac, 1756?‚Äì1811?, printmaker In Moreton's reform for the security and prosperity of the city, a pressing issue is represented by prostitutes, depicted as agents of destruction that easily mislead men into criminality and seem to be \\"the first motive to their villany, and egg them in all manner of mischief\\".Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.15. London prostitutes were vigorously denounced in early eighteenth-century England, especially for their obscenities and aggressiveness. It was a common belief that these vicious women might corrupt young men, particularly apprentices and servants. Watchmen, as guardians of the peace of the streets, were supposed to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken. Moreover, Moreton denounces night houses and cellars as places where prostitutes and thieves meet and carry on their hellish trade. Here criminals \\"wait for signal of their scout; here they cast their schemes, and bring in advices; here they encourage and initiate young thieves; here they barter and sell their stolen goods; these are their exchanges and asylums after mischief\\".Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.17. Thus, night houses stand as wicked fortresses for criminals and they must be suppressed. They were indeed real headquarters of felons, ideal places for the arrangement of their business and for the exchange of goods and information. Apparently they functioned as an unorthodox \\"club\\" for wandering criminals where you could be sure to be welcome and to find companionship if a juicy goal just came out. =Servants= An insidious and internal threat was embodied by servants, having long been a problem in eighteenth-century London. A significant number of domestic servants were accused and stood trial for different levels of theft. London was the principal destination for young people looking for work and fortune, and most of them were employed as servants or apprentices in houses and shops. Defoe presents a detailed inventory of the servants classes in The Behaviour of servants in England (1725), including not only shop-keepers, manufactures, cooks, and footmen, but even clerks to lawyers, attorneys, and gentlemen in public offices.Wall C. 'Defoe and London', in Richetti J. (2008), The Cambridge Companion to Daniel Defoe, New York: Cambridge University Press, p.171. Servants were, in Moreton's opinion, an integral part of the household they worked for, and they should behave as adopted children, being entirely loyal to their employers. On the other hand, their masters and mistresses should also assume their responsibility towards them and \\"see that servants of both sexes go not a rambling when sent to church, but that they keep good hours; for many have been ruined by junketing and staying out, instead of being at church or at home\\".Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, pp.15-16. Yet the temptations of the city and corrupting companionships could easily lead a perfectly diligent servant into the path of crime. A mounting anxiety grew between eighteenth-century Londoners regarding the danger posed by servants seeking employment in order to steal or open the house at night to their accomplices. According to Defoe, living in fear and suspicion of your servants, as feeling unsafe outdoors at night, means to live in an hostile country, a depiction unworthy of his idea of a flourishing England. =Soldiers and sailors= Social security was seriously threatened by the periodic disbandment of the military forces, a common situation at the conclusion of wars that led to hundreds of soldiers and sailors rambling around the streets of London without an occupation or a decent living arrangement. Periods of peace were commonly marked by an increase of violent crimes. In a post-war London competition for a job was fierce and the criminality rate for robbery and property crime rose alarmingly. Although sailors could eventually sign on some merchant ships, soldiers had not such prospects. Moreover, at the moment of their dismissal, cavalrymen had the possibility to keep their horses, having paid for them with their allowances. Adding their experience with weapons and their acquaintance with accomplices in a similar position, there were all the perfect premises for the rising of gangs of robbers and criminal alliances. Moreton appears to be quite clever in tackling this issue. He starts asking for a state surveillance of the soldiers' quarters (to be maintained even after the war), with \\"surveyors that should call at the quarters of every soldier or sailor at a limited hour, to see if they are there or no, and register them at home or absent accordingly; absence to be penal\\",Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.16. and then he progressively moves into employing them in his own project. To keep the streets free of highway robbers and footpads he proposes that soldiers on horses and on foot might be employed to patrol the streets and the surroundings of the city, and also to keep records of the convoys leaving and arriving.Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, pp.20-21. The additional wage for the performance of this service might even keep them from starting a criminal career. =Hackney coach drivers= Among those who earned their living in the streets of London, the more criticized were the hackney coach drivers. Moreton defines them \\"the scum of the people, and, generally speaking, the worst of rogues\\", robbing their customers on a regular basis, and often in league with highway robbers. Hackney coach travellers were generally at the mercy of their carriers, and even the simplest travel could easily turn into a real danger. Even the most \\"honest\\" among them were used to rework the city routes and rates as they pleased in order to increase their profits.Wall C. 'Defoe and London', in Richetti J. (2008), The Cambridge Companion to Daniel Defoe, New York: Cambridge University Press, p.174. Hackney coach drivers were so severely criticized for being rude and abusive, that in 1682 the Common Council had to pass an act for their regulation aiming: to limit their number, to establish a valid licence and a fair charge, and to set out places where they could wait for hire. Moreton brings the attention of the reader on a technicality that might explain why these drivers most of the time managed to walk unpunished. As a matter of fact, the renter of the coach rarely appears to be the actual driver (although they might be in league), therefore \\"the penalty, which used to be on the renter, being now on the driver, the renter or owner of that figure is clear, and the driver has nothing to do but to be absent and laugh at the complainant\\".Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are best, p.18. For this reason, the law needs to be amended so that both the driver and the renter (for Moreton equally guilty) might be accountable for extortion, insolence, or offences. In addition, the renter should be obliged to register and respond for the behaviour of the driver he rented his coach to. =Beggars and vagrants= Shoe Cleaner (c.1759) by Paul Sandby The group that most characterized London streets were beggars and vagrants. The broad eighteenth-century definition for beggar embraced not just the poorest people having to live on the street, but virtually anyone who would stop you asking for money, work, or offering you a service such as: shoe cleaners, linkboys, milkmaids, chimney sweeps, etc. Begging was quite an art, the way you held your body, the sores you showed or not showed, the tone of the voice, your gender and age, the time of the year, the narrative strategies you decided to adopt, all these elements affected the way you begged and had to be consider carefully. Moreton regards beggars and vagrants as potential criminals in disguise and affirms that they \\"should be suppressed, who lounge about all day, to see where they can steal at night\\" and that \\"all shoe- cleaners, I mean boys and sturdy vagrants, be suppressed, [...] as for link- boys, alias thieves with lights\\". Shoeblacks are a peculiar example of a vagrant occupation. Established as an employment at the end of the seventeenth-century, shoe cleaning provided a perfect excuse for approaching passers-by without incurring a penalty. Both legislators and pamphlet writers complained about the long-standing existence of beggars in the streets of London and pushed for their imprisonment and reform.An attempt to regulate begging on the streets was made through the Badging Act (1697), declaring that the poor of a certain parish had to wear a badge for identification. This badge was considered a sort of license to beg in one's own parish. Despite the wide range of seventeenth-century and eighteenth-century anti-vagrancy legislation, some forms of begging were still considered acceptable. Many people were able to maintain their life on the streets, particularly women (especially if pregnant or with children) could keep on begging without being troubled by constables and watchmen. Moreton, however, is not unconcerned of the situation of the decent poor people and vagrants, so he suggests that > barracks or barns should be built at convenient ends of the town, where all > vagrants should be obliged to render themselves at a stated hour, where they > should have clean straw allowed them, and be kept orderly and out of harm's > way; they may be let loose if they have apparent means of honest livelihood, > otherwise they should be sent to the workhouse of their respective parish, > or to a general workhouse, of which there is great need; and of which more > hereafter. This proposition can be valued as an hint of the eighteenth-century ambivalent frame of mind towards these individuals. On one hand restrictions and penalties were vigorously demanded by the English society. On the other hand, not only some kinds of begging activities were allowed but, common people strongly felt a social and religious obligation to give something or to answer a plea. =Geneva shops or the \\"Trade of Wickedness\\"= Gin Lane (1751) by William Hogarth Among the principal causes for the dangers of the streets of London, Moreton lists the abuse of alcohol specifically geneva or gin. In the Gin Era of 1720‚Äì50 very cheap liquors were sold indiscriminately, often resulting in a debauch of spirit-drinking, whose effects were seen on the streets, in the workhouses, in the growing misery of the poor and in an increase of criminality and violent acts. Moreton argues that this wicked trade will be the doom of the English nation, and it represents a real threat to the entire community: > suppose a man able to maintain himself and family by his trade, and at the > same time to be a Geneva drinker. This fellow first makes himself incapable > of working by being continually drunk; which runs him behindhand, so that he > either pawns, or neglects his work, for which reason nobody will employ him. > At last, fear of arrests, his own hunger, the cries of a family for bread, > his natural desire to support an irregular life, and a propense hatred to > labour, turn but too many an honest tradesman into an arrant desperate > rogue. And these are commonly the means that furnish us with thieves and > villains in general.Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.11. The extensive consume of alcohol and the following addiction are widely described in the eighteenth-century newspapers and pamphlets. Bernard Mandeville, a British philosopher and satirist, states that alcohol abuse can produce devastating consequences for a person's judgment: \\"it makes man quarrelsome, renders 'em brutes and savages, sets 'em on to fight for nothing, and had often been the cause of murder\\".See Bernard Mandeville (1714), Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits. Even Henry Fielding, an active participant in the advancement of London law enforcement, points out in his 1751 essay An Enquiry into the Causes of the late Increase of Robbers that such a limitless consumption among the poor seriously threatens the public order and therefore a strict regulation and discipline must be adopted. However eighteenth-century society struggled with the relation between drunkenness and responsibility especially when crime was involved. On one hand, it was believed that intoxication could alter a person's nature leading him to criminal behaviour, and consequently the judges and jurors were inclined to be tolerant towards these infractions. On the other hand, both citizens and law authorities shared the opinion that drunkenness was an unacceptable excuse, so if a crime was committed in such a state the felon must be fully prosecuted. With the harsh punishments of the Bloody Code pending on the head of the offender, English judges and jurors were usually willing to admit a plea for drunkenness. It was often regarded as an extenuating circumstance and most frequently resulted in the possibility of mitigation, acquittal, or pardon. Moreton defines the Gin Craze as the \\"bane and ruin of our lower class people\\".Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.10. He considers the English society as a set of cogs in a machine: if one collapses all collapse. \\"Those who deny an inferior class of people to be necessary in a body politic, contradict reason and experience itself; since they are most useful when industrious, and equally pernicious when lazy. By their industry our manufactures, trade, and commerce, are carried on\\".Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, pp.10-11. To stop this great evil Moreton proposes that all public houses and gin shops should be shut up at 10 p.m. and, considering the large quantities of gin consumed, gin shops should be subjected to licenses so that they can be kept under control. =Reforming manners and social values= Moreton believes that the rising criminality in the streets of London is a result of a late radical change in the English society, which seems to be pervaded by greed and hunger for power at all levels. The love for luxury and a public short-sightedness have shaped a new reality based on avarice and on criminal behaviour, as a consequence of \\"our effeminacy, our toupee wigs, and powdered pates, our tea, and other scandalous fopperies\\". This shift towards greed and social ambition was not prerogative of the middle and upper classes but it could be retrieved even in the lower classes, eager to climb the social ladder. These criticisms are expressively restated in Defoe's Applebee articles: > What can be said in Favour of that Luxury, which is not content with the > Equipage of a Lord; a Coach and Six, a Revenue, with Servants and > Establishments in proportion; but that, to have two Coaches and Six, and two > Sets of Servants, and two Revenues, &c.; would Mortgage Faith and Honour, > Character and Principles, and even run the Risk of losing the Estate they > had, and starving their Posterity? and even in his fictional works such as Moll Flanders and Roxana. Moreover, Moreton is interested in showing how the greediness of a small group of people might affect the entire community. He puts on trial especially bakers, coal merchants, butchers, and tallow chandlers that have dramatically risen their prices because \\"usual and moderate profit will not content them; they cannot drink malt liquor, and the poor must pay for the wine\\".Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.19. Being these basic necessities, \\"for men not being able to support their families by honest labour, and being made beggars by reason of the dearness of provisions, ofttimes grow desperate and turn rogues\\". Moreton proposes a state regulation upon tradesmen, hoping that the \\"government will make them honest, even against their will\\",Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.20. but he also advocates a return to home industry, bringing prosperity to national trade and providing an opportunity to exercise the long-standing tradition of English craftsmanship. The end of the seventeenth-century and the beginning of the eighteenth-century witnessed an increasing concern for vices and immorality spreading all over the country. There was a general sense of falling into the worst possible form of behaviour and a common feeling that avarice, vice, idleness, blasphemy, vagrancy and crime were all entangles together pushing people (poor and wealthy, young and old) into a slippery slope to damnation. A drastic social reformation was required and, at the end of the seventeenth-century, societies for the reformation of manners started emerging with a rank of proper paid agents operating locally. Indeed, Defoe was just one of the many eighteenth-century voices believing that at least part of the falling of the offender was due to a weakening of the social and moral values of the English society. Reforming the streets =Street lighting= As we have seen so far, Moreton pays close attention to the most practical points of his project, as it also happens with the inadequacy of the street lighting system in London; after all his aim is to render the city \\"strongly guarded, and so gloriously illuminated\\".Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.1. Moreton proposes that: > a convenient number of lamps be set up, and those not of the convex kind, > which blind the eyes, and are of no manner of use; they dazzle, but give no > distinct light, and further, rather than prevent robberies. Many persons, > deceived and blinded by these ignes fatui, have been run over by coaches, > carts, &c.;, people stumbling more, even under these very lamps, than in the > dark. In short, they are most unprofitable lights, and, in my opinion, > rather abuses than benefits.Defoe D. (1729), Second Thoughts Are Best, p.14. Between the seventeenth-century and the early eighteenth-century the lightning system of the streets of London was radically transformed with the adoption of lamps with convex lens: a bull's eye glass that had the effect of concentrating the light. This new type of lamp lit up much more of the street than it was usual with candles and lanterns with horn sides; though they produced such a concentrated beam of light to dazzle the passers-by, and preventing them from seeing possible near dangers. According to Moreton, this is not just a minor annoyance but a real peril for the common citizen's life and conversely an unexpected facilitator for criminals. A new lighting legislation was enacted in 1736, setting up a new kind of seal oil lamp giving a better light even during winter. It was also decided that lamps on the main streets should be twenty-five yards apart (and not thirty as before). These changes were well received by the public opinion, and even in the Old Bailey Session Papers was not uncommon to read about victims and witnesses claiming to be able to identify the accused because of a better street lightning. =Securing the streets= Improving the conditions of the streets of London is not just a question of how to prevent crime or to apprehend robbers, Moreton actually recognises how the architectonic structure of roads, lanes, and avenues might make a difference, otherwise \\"all by-turnings, courts, alleys, lanes, &c.;, which may favour a street-robber's escape, and make our project ineffectual\\". London criminals had endless opportunities to escape from a pursuer, and as Henry Fielding wrote in 1751 in his essay An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers: > Whoever indeed considers the Cities of London and Westminster, with the late > vast Addition of their Suburbs; the great irregularity of their Buildings, > the immense Number of Lanes, Alleys, Courts and Bye-places; must think, > that, had they intended for the very purpose of Concealment, they could > scarce have been contrived. Upon such a view, the whole appears as a vast > Wood or Forest, in which a Thief may harbour with as great Security, as wild > Beasts do in the Deserts of Africa or Arabia. And indeed, as we also learn from Defoe's fictions, if you knew where to look the city might offer unexpectedly comfortable corners. London fascinated Defoe and more specifically the many Londons overlapping on the streets: the economically advanced London of shops, merchants, apprentices, and servants; and the dark underworld London of thieves, stockjobbers, ragged children, lurking in the shadow of a street corner.Wall C. 'Defoe and London', in Richetti J. (2008), The Cambridge Companion to Daniel Defoe, New York: Cambridge University Press, p.158. Reforming the theatre The Beggar's Opera (1728) by William Hogarth In each of his pamphlets Andrew Moreton reprimands the theatre and its effects on the English society, especially in the case of The Beggar‚Äôs Opera (1728), a ballad opera by John Gay, where \\"thieves are set out in so amiable a light [‚Ä¶] it has taught them to value themselves on their profession rather than to be ashamed of it\\". Moreton also includes in Second Thoughts Are Best harsh criticisms against the obscure The Quaker's Opera (an imitation of The Beggar‚Äôs Opera) by Thomas Walker, even more wicked than the former. He emphasizes the social impact that such plays might have on simple-minded people, and considers their relevance to the issue of community's well-being: \\"too many weak minds have been drawn away, and many unwary persons so charmed with his appearance on the stage, dressed in that elegant manner, and his pockets so well lined, they have forthwith commenced street-robbers or housebreakers; so that every idle fellow, weary of honest labour, need but fancy himself a Macheath or a Shepherd, and there is a rogue made at once\\". Such objections to The Beggar‚Äôs Opera were widely shared by many contemporary critics, who expressly blamed the play, in various 1728 newspapers, for a new increase in street criminality after a recent decrease. Indeed, during the middle part of the eighteenth-century, highwaymen enjoyed a strange popular adulation. Common people, intrigued by their stories and personalities, would often crowd Newgate prison in order to see them. Jack Sheppard, James Maclean, Dick Turpin became figures of legend in the popular imagination, inhabiting the realms of both reality and fiction. In truth, Daniel Defoe was not immune to this fascination. In 1724 he published History of the Remarkable Life of Sheppard and A Narrative of All robberies, Escapes, &c.; of John Sheppard, portraying the famous robber as a refined criminal exchanging jokes and performing clever tricks. Defoe was captivated by the criminal life, especially when it involved witty stratagems and subterfuges, and as it is clearly shown in his fictions, like Moll Flanders and Colonel Jack, his intent often seems more amusing than didactic. Nevertheless, whenever Defoe deals with social and moral problems he always tries to reach his reader with clarity and practical proposals. The theatre, being a highly influential form of entertainment, \\"ought to be reformed, and nothing exhibited but what might be represented before a bishop\\". The example Moreton recommends is [The Provoked Husband (1728), a play that Colley Cibber, reworked from an unfinished manuscript of John Vanbrugh. It had an enormous success, during its first run it was on stage for twenty-eight nights in a row and it opened two Drury Lane seasons. The play exposes the dynamics of a disrupt marriage, revolving around a frivolous headstrong wife who spends her days gambling, keeping bad companies, spending extravagantly, and speaking insolently to her husband. Yet at the end, moved by her husband kindness and firm principles, she reforms and eventually expresses her gratitude and unworthiness, a turn that bears many similarities with Defoe's fictional works.

It has approximately 115 employees. Crescent Communities creates multifamily and commercial communities in many of the fastest growing markets in the United States. Since 1963, their development portfolio has included more than 57 multifamily communities, 20 million square feet of commercial space, and 60 single family master-planned communities. Its multifamily communities are branded NOVEL by Crescent Communities. The company is actively building in 10 states and operations offices in Charlotte, DC, Atlanta, Orlando, Dallas, and Denver. History In 1939, Duke Power (now Duke Energy) established a forestry department to manage company land not used for power generation. In 1963, this department became the company South Carolina Land and Timber. As the holdings expanded to include land in North Carolina, the organization was renamed Crescent Land and Timber in 1969. Some of the original land was sold to Crescent Land and Timber by the Singer Corporation. In the mid-1980s, the company was renamed Crescent Resources as it began to actively develop residential communities. Crescent Resources began work on its first commercial development, Coliseum Centre, in 1990. As of 1991, Crescent Resources managed 270,000 acres of land. Holdings included part of what became Lake James State Park, which it later sold to the state of North Carolina. Crescent Resources became a separate entity from Duke Energy in 2006, with Duke Energy selling its 49% stake to Morgan Stanley. Crescent Resources filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and has emerged from it separated from the utility company. The company aimed to rebrand itself, renaming itself \\"Crescent Communities\\" in 2013. Fielding Homes  Homebuilding business  Taking advantage of increasing housing demand in the Southeast, and to further diversify their business operations, Crescent Communities launched a single family homebuilding company in early 2016 under the name Fielding Homes.  Sumitomo Forestry  In July 2018, Crescent Communities was acquired by Sumitomo Forestry America, Inc. (‚ÄúSumitomo‚Äù), a comprehensive housing and wood products corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Forestry Co., Ltd., Sumitomo acquired the three key businesses, including single-family residential, multifamily, and commercial businesses. The acquired business retained the Crescent Communities name and remains headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, under the existing management team led by Todd Mansfield, Chief Executive Officer. As part of the acquisition, the Fielding Homes single family home building business became a subsidiary of Dan Ryan Builders, also part of the Sumitomo Forestry America family of companies. Additionally, Palmetto Bluff, the acclaimed 20,000-acre resort community with a Montage branded hotel located in Bluffton, South Carolina, was retained by Crescent Communities‚Äô previous owners.

In 2015 he won six consecutive races including the King's Bishop Stakes, Phoenix Stakes, Breeders' Cup Sprint, and Malibu Stakes, notably without use of the common raceday medication Lasix. He was named American Champion Sprint Horse for 2015. Background Runhappy is a bay horse bred in Kentucky by Wayne, Gray and Bryan Lyster. He is from the first crop of foals sired by Super Saver, the winner of the 2010 Kentucky Derby. Super Saver made a very promising start at stud, with his early progeny also including Competitive Edge (Hopeful Stakes) and Embellish The Lace (Alabama Stakes). Runhappy's dam Bella Jolie won two minor races at Delaware Park Racetrack in 2010. She was descended from Queen Nasra, a broodmare who was the ancestor of many important winners including Balanchine. As a yearling the colt was consigned to the Keeneland Sales in September 2013 and was bought for $200,000 by Jim McIngvale, who made his fortune in the furniture business. The colt was initially sent into training with McIngvale's racing manager and sister-in-law Laura Wohlers. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= Runhappy made his first appearance in a maiden race at over six and a half furlongs on the synthetic track at Turfway Park in Kentucky on December 28. Ridden by Adrian Garcia he started second favorite in an eleven-runner field. He went to the front soon after the start and won by eight and a quarter lengths despite showing his inexperience by veering to the right in the straight. =2015: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Runhappy was moved up in class for the Grade III Lecomte Stakes at Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans on January 17. He suffered at least two serious bumps from his opponents and finished ninth of the eleven runners behind International Star. After the race, Maria Borell took over from Wohlers as the colt's trainer. On his first appearance for Borell, Runhappy won an allowance race over six furlongs on a sloppy track at Indiana Grand Race Course on July 7. On a fast track at Ellis Park Race Course later that month, he won a six and a half allowance, leading for most of the way to beat Springboard by two and three quarter lengths. In both races, he was ridden by Erin Walker. Edgar Prado took over the ride when Runhappy was moved up sharply in class for the Grade I King's Bishop Stakes over seven furlongs at Saratoga Race Course on August 29. Before the race, Borell explained that she would not use the common raceday medication Lasix, saying, \\"I don't like drugs and I don't want to run on Lasix if a horse doesn't need it. Runhappy doesn't need it and he's run Lasix-free in all of his starts\\". Holy Boss, the winner of the Amsterdam Stakes, started as that race's public betting favorite. The other runners included Competitive Edge (Hopeful Stakes), March (Woody Stephens Stakes), Mr Z (Ohio Derby), and Grand Bili (Carry Back Stakes). Runhappy raced in second place before overtaking outsider Limousine Liberal after the first quarter mile. He maintained his advantage and then drew away from his rivals to win by four lengths from Limousine Liberal in a race record time of 1:20.54 with Holy Boss two lengths back in third. After the race, Prado commented, \\"The plan was to break good out of the gate. He was doing everything so easy and I was very confident in him going into the first turn. When he started pricking his ears and looking for competition, that made me feel good. When I asked him on the top of the stretch and he picked it up, I knew we were in good shape.\\" On October 2, the opening day of the Keeneland Fall meeting, Runhappy started 7/5 favorite for the Grade III Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs on a sloppy track. Holy Boss was again in opposition, but the main danger appeared to come from Work All Week, the reigning American Champion Sprint Horse. Ridden again by Prado, Runhappy led for most of the way and kept on in the straight to win by one and three quarter lengths from Hutcheson Stakes winner Brabados, with Work All Week tking third ahead of Holy Boss. After the race, Borell said, \\"He's very talented. He's an amazing horse. I'm so lucky and blessed to have him. Thank you so much, James McIngvale and Laura Wohlers. I'm so blessed.\\" She also reiterated her stand on Lasix, saying, \\"We've never given him any drugs, and we're proud of that\\", while Laura Wohlers said, \\"Maria's very happy about being in a barn that doesn't believe in drugs. She's excited to train clean, and it's good to know he's out there running and that's him\\". At Keeneland on October 31, Runhappy, ridden again by Prado, started 8/5 favorite in a fourteen-runner field for the Breeders' Cup Sprint. The multiple Grade I winner Private Zone was second in the betting ahead of Wild Dude (Santa Anita Sprint Championship), Salutos Amigos (Tom Fool Handicap), Limousine Liberal, Masochistic (Triple Bend Invitational Handicap), Kobe's Back (San Vicente Stakes), Big Macher (Bing Crosby Handicap), Holy Boss, and Barbados. Holy Boss took the early lead before Private Zone took over a quarter of a mile from the finish. Runhappy, however, had always been going well behind the leaders and ran on strongly in the closing stages to take the lead 75 yards from the finish and win by three quarters of a length from Private Zone in a track- record time of 1:08.58. Outsider Favorite Tale took third ahead of Holy Boss and Salutos Amigos. After the race, McIngvale said, \\"We're going to run him next year and see how he does and try to stretch him out [run over longer distance]. Should be a lot of fun. My favorite words are authentic, genuine, real, and transparent. I think if we're going to talk the talk and walk the walk, we've got to do it. No Lasix for us. No drugs. Just hay, oats, and lots of water\\". On November 1, the day after the Breeders' Cup, Wohlers, acting as racing manager for McIngvale, dismissed Borell from her position as the colt's trainer. Wohlers claimed the decision had been made prior to the Breeders' Cup. Borell claimed, however, that she had been dismissed because she refused Wohlers' request to send the colt to the track for exercise after finding heat and mild swelling in one of his legs. The ensuing debate between the parties initially played out largely on social media for several days until Borell filed suit against McIngvale on November 10, 2015, alleging breach of contract and defamation. While Borell initially named Keeneland in her suit, requesting that the track hold in escrow a portion of the purse money that was claimed in the lawsuit, the Fayette County Circuit Court held that the court could not order Keeneland to do so. McIngvale had a long history of summarily firing horse trainers, over 30 , including Hall of Famers Bob Baffert and Bobby Frankel. After Borell was dismissed, Wohlers took over again as the colt's trainer. Runhappy was sent to California, where he won the Grade I Malibu Stakes on December 26, 2015, while giving five pounds to the field. His lengths win was the first Grade I win for Wohlers. His connections stated after the race that they intended to race him in 2016 and attempt longer distances. In January 2016, Runhappy was named American Champion Sprint Horse for 2015 at the Eclipse Awards after taking 255 of the 261 votes. In the 2015 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Runhappy was rated the joint fifth best sprinter in the world behind Able Friend, Muhaarar, Lankan Rupee, and Chautauqua. Runhappy at the 2016 Breeders' Cup =2016: Four-year-old season= On February 28, Runhappy returned to training, following a two-month break at a farm in Texas.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse- racing/articles/209303/runhappy-returns-to-kentucky-training-center He was initially targeting the Grade II Churchill Downs Stakes,http://www.courier- journal.com/story/sports/horses/2016/02/10/report-champion-sprinter-runhappy- pointed-to-churchill-downs-stakes/80200772/ but slight bruising on his right hind heel delayed his return to the races by a few weeks.http://www.courier- journal.com/story/sports/horses/2016/03/31/report-runhappy-injured-wont-run- kentucky-derby-day-at-churchill-downs/82464240/ He remained in light training with a protective bar shoe covering his bruised heel. On March 31, McIngvale announced that Runhappy would be pointed to the Grade I Metropolitan Mile.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/210335/runhappy-targets- met-mile-for-season-opener However, Runhappy's hoof bruise continued to limit his training into April, making it uncertain whether he would race. On April 13, Wohlers stated: \\"He galloped for us Sunday, and when we asked him to gallop again Monday, he kind of looked like he didn't want to, so we didn't push it. We'll just jog him until the end of the month and see where we are with him then.\\" On June 11, Runhappy was diagnosed with a bone bruise on his right front cannon bone, putting him on the sidelines for 60 days.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/212384/runhappy-on-the- shelf-for-60-days He returned to racing on October 1 in the Ack Ack Handicap at Churchill Downs, where he finished fourth. He then was sent to California for the 2016 Breeders' Cup, where he was entered in the DIrt MIle. Though he gained an initial lead in the race, he began to fade by the pole and finished eighth out of nine horses.http://www.equibase.com/static/chart/pdf/SA110416USA7.pdf Although McIngvale had paid $1 million to purchase a slot in the inaugural running of the Pegasus World Cup in January 2017, after the Breeders' Cup, he decided to retire Runhappy, who was sent to stand at stud at Claiborne Farm with an initial stud fee of $25,000. Title sponsorship of race meets In 2019, Runhappy ‚Äî through Claiborne Farms and McIngvale ‚Äî became the title sponsor of the racing meet held at Kentucky Downs near Franklin, Kentucky, which stages a short meet each summer on a European-style turf course. The meet is believed to be the first in the U.S. to be sponsored by a race horse, and one of the first to have a title sponsorship of any kind. The sponsorship was renewed in 2020.

Born in Frampton, Lincolnshire, Holmes left education at the age of nine to work on a farm, and at the age of eleven, briefly became a sailor. He then returned to farm labour in Lincolnshire, but lost his job when he tried to organise a strike. In 1882, he gained work with the Great Northern Railway Company in Spalding, and he quickly rose within the company to become a signalman in Retford.David Howell, Dictionary of Labour Biography vol.XI, pp.130-140 Holmes joined the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants in the early 1880s, but did not become active in the union until around 1890, when he was president of the Retford branch. He was also active in the Liberal Party and the Labour Electoral Association, supporting J. T. Yoxall at the 1892 general election in Bassetlaw. Soon after the election, he admitted breaching railway regulations and his employer decided to downgrade him. He refused offers of less senior posts and was instead sacked. He sued the company for wages for a period in which he had been suspended, but lost the case. The ASRS supported him, and although he found work at the Singer Sewing Machine Company in Doncaster, he remained active in his old union. In 1896, Holmes stood unsuccessfully for Doncaster Town Council as a Lib-Lab candidate. He became a full-time organiser for the ASRS in 1898 in Wales and Western England, but he found it difficult to work with the union's new general secretary, Richard Bell, who tried to dismiss Holmes after his involvement in the Taff Vale Case in which damages were awarded against the ASRS. Holmes retained his position on a vote of members, but was censured, and in 1906 moved back to Doncaster to organise in northern England, where he remained for the rest of his career, staying post when the ASRS became the National Union of Railwaymen. Holmes stood for the Labour Representation Committee in Birmingham East at the 1906 general election, taking 47.4% of the vote and narrowly missing out on election. He then stood in the 1907 Kingston-upon-Hull West by-election for the renamed Labour Party, where he took third place with 29.1%, then finally he contested the 1912 Crewe by-election, where he took only 17.7%. Holmes was strongly supportive of Britain's role in World War I and spoke at recruitment meetings, although he opposed conscription. He left the Labour Party and, although he was active in supporting the railway strike of 1919, he was keen to emphasis his opposition to Bolshevism. He retired in 1922 and died twelve years later.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been built during the 18th century with later expansion during the 19th and 20th centuries. The temple has a five-tiered gopuram, the gateway tower and a granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple is open from 6am - 12 pm and 5 - 8:30 pm on all days except during new moon days when it is open the full day. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which Panguni Pongal and Chithirai Pongal festivals being the most prominent.

By the end of the 19th century, the Nadars‚Äô rapid rise as a business community lead to confrontation with the Maravars. The Nadars were holding the ownership of the Badrakali temple and other smaller shrines in the north of the town. The Nadars were denied entry to the Kasi Viswanathar temple and when they tried to enter in 1899, it led to a series of riots which became known as the Sivakasi riots. The Badrakali temple was closed for a number of days during the riots and the festivals were cancelled.

He is known for his numerous art collections across Europe. Early life Ivan was the eldest son of landowner and sugar manufacturer Nikola Tereshchenko and his wife Pelageya. From 1883 to 1891, Tereshchenko worked in the Kiev City Council. He was a co-founder of the Sugar Refinery Factories' Association of the Tereshchenko Brothers. In 1897, he decided to build a villa on the French Riviera, on the hills above Cannes. The rapid economic growth of Russia in the late 19th-century, as well as friendly relations between Russia and France, allowed many wealthy Russian industrialists to settle on the C√¥te d'Azur. At that time, the Russian Navy had leased the French Bay of Villefranche-sur-Mer over a number of years. Mykola Tereshchenko (b. 1820, d. 1903) and his sons, Ivan and Aleksander Tereshchenko, were well-known patrons of the arts; Nikolay was a financial supporter of the Kiev and Glukhov art museums, and Ivan supported the Kiev Drawing School. Together with his younger brother, Alexander, Ivan Tereshchenko studied at the Kreyman private school in Moscow, after which he enrolled at the University of St. Vladimir, and graduated with a Gradus Academicus in law. He briefly served as a cornet at the Grodno Hussars Life Guards. During his years of military service, he became close friends with Vasily Vereshchagin, the official artist of the Russian army. Ivan Tereshchenko as a Cornet of the Life Guards regiment of Grodno, 1880. Collections Ivan was a connoisseur and collector of art, for which he became well known throughout the Russian Empire, devoting his life to his collection and patronage. The first paintings purchased by Ivan Nikolovich were the Vereshchagin works depicting battle scenes. One of these battlefield paintings, the \\"Winners 1878-1879,\\" was a scene from the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78). The work depicted victorious Turkish soldiers removing the boots and uniforms from the corpses of Russian mercenaries who had fought on the side of Serbia, leaving the dead and wounded at the mercy of birds of prey. This painting, exhibited in St. Petersburg, shocked Russian civilians and stirred up national pride, following which Emperor Alexander II of Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The battle paintings became the first masterpieces in Nikolovich's huge collection. His collection reflected his fondness for Art Nouveau. Philanthropy In May 1876, painter and art teacher Mykola Murashko asked Ivan for funding for his new art school. This led Tereshchenko to become a patron of the Murashko school for nearly 25 years. During the period, he was also appointed as honorary trustee of the Kiev and Alexander craft schools. Personal life Ivan married Elizabeth Sarancheva, the daughter of Colonel Saranchev. History states that when he asked Elizabeth to marry him, her father declared that they would not get married until after the first snowfall. The next morning Ivan arranged for the whole street leading to the bride's house to be covered with sugar. Ivan's father, however, was not impressed by this ruse, and in April 1880, at the insistence of his father, Ivan resigned and went to Europe to collect art. By the turn of the century, they owned approximately 153,000 ha and were among the largest landowners in the Russian Empire. Death  Ivan Tereshchenko is buried next to his daughter Olga, who was born in 1882 and died in childhood. They are buried in the Tereshchenko family's estate, where an angel crafted in white marble watches over Olga's grave.

He was obliged to emigrate and in 1935 was in France where after 1940 he joined the French Resistance. He died in an accident during the late summer of 1942 while attempting to escape from collaborationist France to Switzerland. Life Alfred Benjamin was born in Elberfeld, then a rapidly growing industrial town, today part of Wuppertal. His father was an ironmonger. The family identified as Jewish. Benjamin trained for work as a bank clerk. As a young man he studied Marxist texts and became aligned with the Labour movement, and in 1930, by which time he lived in D√ºsseldorf, he joined the Communist Party and the Federation of Independent Employees (Allgemeiner freier Angestelltenbund / AfA-Bund). In the aftermath of the World Economic Crisis he lost his job. However, he took on responsibility for political communication on behalf of the Communist Party in the D√ºsseldorf, targeting employees of the larger manufacturing businesses and distribution companies. He also founded a cabaret group called \\"Kolonne Stehkragen\\", himself writing the lyrics for most of their songs. In 1932 he received a prison sentence for distributing leaflets. Two months after Germany's 1933 regime change, in March 1933 Alfred Benjamin was taken into what the new government termed Protective custody (\\"Schutzhaft\\") and interned in the \\"Ulmer H√∂he\\" concentration camp, transferred later to the camp at Esterwegen, where he was held till October 1933. He was then detained in the Camp at Lichtenburg bei Torgau till December 1933 or December 1934 after which he was encouraged by the Gestapo to emigrate to Palestine. He initially rejected police requirements that he should emigrate and instead made contact with his comrades, to resume his political activities on behalf of the now illegal Communist Party. Threatened with further arrest, however, during or before Summer 1935 he was instructed by the party to emigrate to France where the German Communist Party had already established its exiled headquarters in Paris. In September 1935 he was arrested by the French police after he had made an appearance at a trades union meeting in order to call for solidarity with the German socialist Alfred Kayser, who had recently been sentenced to death. It was only with difficulty that Benjamin avoided deportation to Spain following this incident. He nevertheless remained in France, and in 1936 started producing the news-sheet \\"Trait d‚ÄôUnion\\", which he used to inform French workers about the situation in Germany and the anti-Fascist resistance struggle. As well as this he worked as editor for the (German language) Communist Party news-sheet \\"Frage und Antwort\\" (\\"Questions and answers\\"). In September 1939 both France and Britain declared war on Germany. It would be some months before it became clear what this would mean for Germany, but in the meantime, in both Paris and London, large number of German political exiles who had emigrated to escape the Nazi government at home were identified as enemy aliens and arrested. Albert Benjamin was arrested and in October 1939 interned in the camp at Rieucros, close to the border with Spain. In February 1942 all the detainees who had been held at Riecros were transferred to a recently converted camp at Brens, near to Albi. By this time, on 22 February 1941, he had married Dora Davidsohn (following her second marriage known as Dora Schaul). The two had met in 1934, probably in Amsterdam, as two of many Jewish German Communist exiles looking for a new home. In 1935 they had settled in Paris where he had been known to her as \\"Benn\\", and they had lived together till arrested in 1939. By August 1942 Albert Benjamin was being held at a labour camp at Chanac in central southern France. That was the month in which he managed to escape. The escape appeared timely because during the later summer of 1942 German and Polish Jews still held in southern France were being separated from the other detainees and deported to concentration camps outside France where, a matters turned out, many were later killed. Following his own escape both Albert Benjamin and his wife (who had escaped from a different internment camp a few weeks earlier) headed separately towards Switzerland. Unfortunately Albert Benjamin died in an accident in eastern France before reaching Switzerland. Much of the available information on his life and death has survived only because of his widow's later determination to ensure that their story should never be lost.

The rangkiang is a distinctive feature of Minangkabau architecture. The structure is traditionally found in the courtyard of a rumah gadang, the traditional house of Minangkabau people. Etymology The word rangkiang is a shortened version from the Minangkabau word \\"ruang hyang (Dewi Sri)\\" (\\"room of goddess (Dewi Sri)\\"), the goddess of rice. Architecture Two rangkiang in a photo circa 1895 of rice granaries in the Minangkabau architectural style in Batipuh in the Padang Plateau, Sumatra A rangkiang is a structure built over a raised pile foundation, an Austronesian legacy that can be found anywhere else in Indonesia. It has a distinguished roof shape known as gonjong (\\"spired\\") roofs, similar to a Minangkabau traditional house, the rumah gadang. The gonjong roof symbolically identifies it with buffalo horns. Similar to the rumah gadang, the roof of a rangkiang is traditionally a thatched roof made of palm fibre (ijuk), and it is also similarly decorated. The only opening to a rangkiang is a small rectangular hatch high up in the gable end, into which the harvested rice is placed. A ladder is required to reach this hatch. A rangkiang is traditionally built on the courtyard of a rumah gadang. There are three types of rangkiangs according to its function. A rangkiang which is used to store rice that is to be consumed by the inhabitants of the house is known as si bayau-bayau. This rangkiang, the largest of all rangkiang, is traditionally supported by a minimum of six poles; in the case of a royal palace ‚Äîsuch as the rangkiang of the Pagaruyung Palace‚Äî it can be supported by as many as twelve poles. This rangkiang is traditionally located to the right end of a rumah gadang's courtyard. Another type of rangkiang is si tinjau lauik (\\"the one that explores the sea\\") used to keep rice that is to be sold. The resulting money is used to buy things that the family cannot produce themselves. This rangkiang is traditionally located in the middle of a rumah gadang's courtyard. It is supported by four poles. Another type of rangkiang is the si tanggung lapar or si tangguang lapa or si tangka lapa (\\"the one the supports hunger\\"), which is used to store surplus rice for use in times of scarcity. This type of rangkiang is traditionally positioned to the left end of a rumah gadang courtyard. It is basically identical with the si tinjau laut, being supported by four poles. A model of a rangkiang Other rangkiang, known as rangkiang kaciak (\\"little granary\\"), is used to keep rice seedlings (padi abuan) for agricultural purpose. This rangkiang used a simple gable roof instead of the elaborate Minangkabau roof form, thus it looks the simplest of all rangkiang. The number of rangkiang, as well as the degree of ornaments that decorates the rumah gadang, shows the wealth of the owner. The more rangkiang possessed by a family, the more prestigious the owner is. Modern use A facade of a Minangkabau restaurant is sometimes decorated with a single gonjong roof which represents the roof of a rangkiang as a symbol of rice and food provision for people.

The game was initially released in early access in October 2013 after a successful Kickstarter campaign, and it was officially released on Steam July 2, 2015. Gameplay Legends of Eisenwald is a fantasy role-playing game set in a fictitious duchy of Eisenwald in medieval Germany in times of Holy Roman Empire. The main focus of the story in the main campaign revolves around the life of the youngest child of Baron Lahnstein who on return to his lands finds that the family castle is impossible to enter. There are two separate single scenarios: The Masquerade and Cursed Castle that are separate stories happening in other locations of Eisenwald. The gameplay is divided into two main parts: global map interactions including completing quests, buying and selling armor, weapons, potions and other equipment and items, equipping the army, managing castles, and other possessions, and finally the battles themselves. Battles consist of confrontations between a hero's squad (which can take up to eleven other troops) and an enemy squad. At the end of the battle, the winning side receives experience points. All units receive XP proportionally to their contribution in the battle. If sufficient XP is accumulated by a unit, it may then upgrade to another, determined by its upgrade tree if any. Upgrade of the units is free and even if a unit is not upgraded right away, its extra upgrade points are saved for later. At the beginning of a campaign, the player may select his or her class (Knight, Baroness, or a Mystic). Each class has its own advantages. For example, a knight can learn to ride a horse, a baroness can use both bows and crossbows, and a mage can learn mass spells. Unlike regular units, heroes don't change their look when they upgrade, they can learn new skills. Hero skill trees are divided into three parts: combat, feudal and command. Combat skills are unique for each class whereas feudal and command skills are shared among the three heroes. The game features many different units including soldiers, spearmen, nobles, pikemen, priests, monks, healers, witches and more that have different parameters and skills.

The membership is made up of the heads, or deans of the medical schools. It was formerly known as the Council of Heads of Medical Schools. History The origins of the Medical Schools Council dates back to 1947, when the Conference of Deans of Provincial Medical Schools was formed. In 1989, this merged with the Conference of Deans of London Medical Schools, and in 2006 the organisation changed its name to the Medical Schools Council.https://www.medschools.ac.uk/about-us/history Widening participation The Medical Schools Council is involved in aiding medical schools improve access for applicants with a broader range of backgrounds. In the late nineties, the Medical Schools Council (then CHMS) looked at admission data and concluded that men and people from ethnic minorities were suffering from discrimination when they applied to medical schools. It was noted that the gender variation may \\"reflect the fact that girls are doing better academically than boys in school.\\" While men still currently outnumber women in the medical profession, the General Medical Council reported that the number of female doctors is continuously increasing. A 17% increase was also reported in the number of UK Graduate GPs who are Black and Minority Ethnic (BME). Medical schools have been criticized for failing to enroll enough students from lower-income backgrounds with research showing that 80 percent of applications to medicine came from only 20 percent of schools. It was also found that approximately half of all applicants came from private or grammar schools. In 2008, after the Tooke inquiry into Modernising Medical Careers, the Council were again asked to look at selection of medical school applicants. Much of the Medical Schools Council's widening participation work was initiated as response to the 2012 report Fair Access to the Professions from the Child Poverty and Social Mobility Commission. This report stated that \\"‚Ä¶medicine lags behind other professions both in the focus and in the priority it accords to these issues. It has a long way to go when it comes to making access fairer, diversifying its workforce and raising social mobility.\\" In July 2013 the \\"Selecting for Excellence\\" project began, which the Medical Schools Council had commissioned to widen participation in medicine and analyse the barriers for applicants from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The report found that in the preceding three-year period, just under half of the schools and colleges in the UK did not provide any applicants to study medicine at British universities. The final report launched with 68 recommendations which are currently being implemented in December 2014. Medical schools were encouraged to do more to help disadvantaged students with their applications and preparations for admission tests. In conjunction with National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), the Medical Schools Council planned to organise for volunteers from the medical profession to visit pupils at the country's 18,000 primary schools during October 2015. The campaign was entitled \\"Who's in Heath?\\" and included the participation of the Chief Medical Officers of Scotland and Wales. However, there were some criticisms that primary children were too young to be introduced to medicine and instead the focus should be on the years closer to applying to university.  Assessments  The Medical Schools Council plays a role in coordinating medical schools as they develop assessments. Much of the Council's assessment work is now carried out through MSC Assessment, formed in 2014. = Education Performance Measure and Situational Judgement Test = In 2010, the Medical Schools Council was commissioned by the UK Department of Health to lead an appraisal of approaches for selection of medical graduates into the UK Foundation Programme. After considering evidence the project group decided to pilot two new selection methods: Educational Performance Measure and a situational judgement test. The Educational Performance Measure (EPM) is a measure of clinical and non- clinical skills, knowledge and performance up to the point of application to the Foundation Programme. The Situational Judgement Test is a multiple-choice assessment of aptitude for employment and professional attributes as they relate to medicine. Following pilots, both Educational Performance Measure and Situational Judgement Test now form the entry into the Foundation Programme. Along with the UK Foundation Programme Office, the Medical Schools Council continues to administer the Situational Judgement Test through MSC Assessment. During the first use of the Situational Judgement Test for medical students in 2013, an error in the machine-marking process meant that all test papers had to be remarked by hand. Job offers were reissued and the Medical Schools Council apologised to affected medical students. = Prescribing Safety Assessment = MSC Assessment, jointly with the British Pharmacological Society, developed the Prescribing Safety Assessment, originally called the Prescribing Skills Assessment. This is an assessment of the prescribing skills of final-year medical students with the intention that it ‚Äòallows all students to demonstrate their competencies in relation to the safe and effective use of medicines‚Äô. It was initiated as a response to a General Medical Council sponsored study in 2009 which found that 9% of hospital prescriptions contain errors. The assessment was developed and piloted from 2011 to 2013, with further drive added to the initiative by a 2014 General Medical Council report which surveyed newly graduated doctors and found that prescribing was consistently the area they found most challenging. The assessment is now becoming part of the final year landscape in publicly funded UK medical schools. In 2016, the Prescribing Safety Assessment was shortlisted at the BMJ Awards for \\"Education Team of the Year\\".  Other Projects  = Clinical Academia = The Medical Schools Council works to promote clinical academic careers i.e. for those doctors who are employed by universities and undertake teaching and research alongside their clinical commitments. This is vital to maintain the standard of medical research in the UK. In cooperation with the Dental Schools Council, the Medical Schools Council has produced a survey of clinical academic staffing levels in UK medical and dental schools since 2000, producing the reports annually since 2003. The two councils launched the Clinical Academic Jobs website in 2008 as a means for universities to advertise specialist clinical academic roles. = Student Fitness to Practise = The Medical Schools Council regularly works with the General Medical Council to develop guidance for medical schools on how to run robust and fair fitness to practise processes. Fitness to practise procedures are the mechanism through which medical schools address concerns about a student's professionalism rather than their academic performance. The Medical Schools Council also works with the General Medical Council to develop advice to students as to how they can ensure that they behave professionally whilst at medical school and maintain the trust that the population as a whole has in doctors. Medical school culture Data analysed by the House of Commons library has shown that demand for General Practitioners in the UK is increasing, while the number of actual GP's is drastically falling. The British Medical Association has said that GP surgeries are at \\"breaking point.\\" In October 2014, Maureen Baker, Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) announced that she was to attend a meeting with the Medical Schools Council, to look at why some medical schools appeared to have a ‚Äòtoxic anti-GP culture‚Äô. To combat this, the Medical Schools Council is working with the RCGP to promote general practice careers and said that its members have made a \\"commitment to articulate the importance of general practice to students.\\" Governance The membership of the Medical Schools Council consists of UK medical schools. The Council has 42 members, of which 41 represent undergraduate medical schools and one represents a post-graduate only medical school. The chief executive is Katie Petty-Saphon. The current co-chairs, appointed in August 2019, are Professor John Atherton, Pro Vice Chancellor and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Nottingham School of Medicine and Professor Malcolm Reed, Dean of Brighton and Sussex Medical School. It has headquarters in Woburn House, London. Each medical school pays a yearly subscription to be part of the Medical Schools Council. In 2015 it had an income of around ¬£1million. In 2015, it took part in a review, along with Dental Schools Council to try to improve equality and diversity across its own organisation.

Born in Moresby, near Whitehaven, Stephenson left school at the age of fourteen and followed his father in working at the Walkmill Colliery. Inspired by Tom Cape and various socialist speakers, Stephenson joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and became active in the Cumberland Miners' Association (CMA).Keith Gildart and Gidon Cohen, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XI, pp.266-274 Stephenson rose to promince during a lock-out of miners in 1921, and was also a leading figure in a fifteen-week strike in 1923. During the UK general strike, he called for the nationalisation of the mines. In August 1926, he was convicted of intimidating strikebreakers and was sentences to one month of hard labour. He was elected as a Labour Party member of Whitehaven Town Council in 1923. He supported the ILP disaffiliating from the Labour Party in 1932, although he stated that he would have supported them remaining if the ILP had been allowed to organise in Parliament. Following the disaffiliating, Stephenson was chosen as the North East representative on the ILP's National Administrative Council. He was consistently re-elected to Ennerdale Rural District Council, and he was selected as the ILP candidate for Whitehaven at the 1935 general election. However, he took only 3.3% of the votes cast and, although he remained loyal to the ILP, he began to focus his work in the labour movement. Stephenson was elected as financial secretary of the CMA in 1935, then when Cape retired, he became general secretary, moving to Workington. He was elected to the national executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain in 1939, where he was the leading proponent of strikes during World War II. Within the ILP, he was criticised for supporting armed support for the Soviet Union. He stood down from its national council in 1942, and left the party in about 1946, his wife paying his membership to the Labour Party. He remained known as a militant trade unionist until he retired in 1960. Shortly after, he suffered the first of several strokes, and died in 1962.

He developed a work on predicting the passage of the moon which was in use during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Life Liu Hong was from Mengyin County (), Taishan Commandery, which is present-day Mengyin County, Shandong, and was a descendant of Liu Yu, the Prince of Lu, a son of Emperor Jing ( 157‚Äì141 BCE). He developed an interest in astronomy at an early age. He was made an officer at the Imperial Astronomy around 160 CE which led to him writing the lost works Qi Yao Shu (‰∏ÉÊõúË°ì; The Art of the Seven Planets) and Ba Yuan Shu (ÂÖ´ÂÖÉË°ì; The Art of Eight Elements). After the death of his father, Liu Hong retired for a short time but returned to his work, collaborating with Cai Yong on the Qian Xiang Li (‰πæË±°ÊõÜ; Qian Xiang Calendar), this was considered so advanced for its time that it was adopted by the Han government immediately. The calendar predicted the movement of the moon, the first time such considerations had been made in ancient China. This system marked the first appearance of the argument of periapsis, a means to calculate syzygy (the calculation between three celestial bodies), and a means of charting the moon through the seasons. His means of establishing the accuracy of the calendar was by the detection of eclipses. This system replaced one which had been used by the Han dynasty since 85 CE, and following the end of the Han dynasty and beginning of the Three Kingdoms period, it was adopted by the Eastern Wu state (229‚Äì280 CE) until China was re-unified under the Jin dynasty in 280 CE. In 179 CE, he was asked by the Imperial Secretariat to consider proposals made by a private scholar called Wang Han regarding lunar calendars, but did not support those proposals. A year later, the Minister of Ceremonies assigned him to review alternative means of calculating eclipses Throughout his service under the Han government, Liu Hong held various positions, including: Internuncio (), gucheng menhou (), Commandant of the East District of Kuaiji (), Administrator of Shanyang (), and Chancellor of Qucheng ().

On 14 March 1925 Farrell played in a 2‚Äì1 home defeat against the Welsh Football League XI. His teammates on this occasion included Ernie MacKay, John Joe Flood, Dave Roberts and Johnny Murray. On 7 November 1925 he played again against the Welsh Football League XI in a 2‚Äì2 away draw. On 13 March 1926 he scored in 3-1 win against the Irish League XI at Dalymount Park. On both of the latter occasions all of the \\"Four F's\\" also featured. Bob Fullam and Flood scored in the away game against the Welsh selection. Fulham also scored against the Irish League XI. =Ireland trialist= In March 1926 Ireland were preparing to play Italy in a friendly. Farrell took part in trials for the team and also played for a Leinster XI against a Munster XI in an unofficial trial. He had played poorly in this interprovincial match and failed to impress the national team selectors. The day before he had scored a hat-trick while playing for Shamrock Rovers in a League of Ireland Shield game against Brideville but had picked up a hip injury in the process. Despite his prolific goalscoring record and experience playing for the League of Ireland XI, Farrell was left out of the squad for the Italy game and was overlooked in favour of Ned Brooks and Fran Watters.

Pritchard, is the head of oncology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Canada, specializing in breast cancer therapies, and leading the clinical trials division of the centre. She has authored numerous studies on women's health, breast cancer, hormone replacement therapy, public health, and research methodology. According to Thomson Reuters, Pritchard was one of the most cited researchers in the world in 2014 and 2015. Biography Kathleen I. Pritchard, CM, grew up in Deep River, Ontario. She graduated from the local high school in 1964. She earned her Bachelor's in Science in 1968 from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and attained her medical degree there in 1971. Her practicum in Internal Medicine was completed at Wellesley Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, and Toronto General Hospital. Between 1973 and 1974 at the University of Toronto, Pritchard focused on research into melanoma and tumor immunology, and then in 1977 began researching breast cancer in clinical trials as a research fellow at the University of Toronto. Between 1978 and 1984, Pritchard conducted clinical trials at Women's College Hospital under an award granted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC). In 1984, she was appointed head of Medical Oncology and Haematology at Women's College Hospital and chair of the Breast Cancer Site Group of the NCIC. Three years later, Pritchard moved to the Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre in Toronto where she has served as head of Medical Oncology. A decade later, in 1997, she was appointed to head the Clinical Trials and Epidemiology at the Odette Cancer Centre of Sunnybrook. She has been involved in numerous studies and is one of Canada's most-known academic physicians, researching such topics as chemotherapy verses hormone therapy, the effects of aging and menopause for risk of breast cancer, and drugs which aid in non-recurrence. Research Pritchard is an oncologist and researcher with involvement in numerous clinical studies. Her research spans a range of topics, but it focuses primarily on women's health and breast cancer therapies. Her research goals include the development of individualized patient therapies and the advancement of prognostic tests. Some of her research investigates the use of genetic factors to predict disease progression and to formulate tailored treatment plans. In addition to looking at genetics, Pritchard's research aims to better understand primary and secondary combination treatments, taking into account the patient's age and stage in life. Pritchard's clinical trials have yielded findings that have transformed breast cancer treatment approaches worldwide. Pritchard is published in numerous significant journals of oncology, including The New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, The Journal of Clinical Oncology, The Lancet, and The Lancet Oncology. One of Pritchard's self-proclaimed \\"eureka\\" moments was in a clinical trial concerning the use of the drug Letrozole as an adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women who had taken tamoxifen for five years as a primary breast cancer treatment. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that reduces estrogen production, which is necessary for tumor growth. Pritchard followed over 5,000 postmenopausal women that had taken tamoxifen for their breast cancer and treated them with either Letrozole or a placebo. Letrozole treatment reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence by over 40%. The study ended early because of overwhelmingly positive results. The drug also prevented metastasis of the cancer to other regions of the body. Results from this clinical study were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2003, and two years later the therapy was approved by Health Canada. Later studies suggested that extending treatment with an aromatase inhibitor like Letrozole to ten years further increases disease-free survival rates. Another study looked at the effects of adjuvant therapies like Letrozole in women of different ages, both premenopausal and postmenopausal. Pritchard found that Letrozole favorably impacted women in both groups but was overall more effective in premenopausal women that had been previously treated with tamoxifen. The overarching conclusion from this study was that anti-estrogen treatments like Letrozole generally benefit patients when administered anytime after the primary treatment. Pritchard has postulated that women with breast cancer and high levels of the Her-2/neu protein are predisposed to respond more favorably to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy drugs than women with normal Her-2/neu levels. The target of anthracycline drugs is Topoisomerase II, and its location in regards to the Her-2 gene on the chromosome is what allows the anthracycline drug to be effective in patients with heavy expression of the Her-2/neu protein. Pritchard demonstrated that women with high levels of Her-2 expression have a better response to the anthracycline containing drugs in a clinical trial. Pritchard's research suggests that the Her-2 gene could be useful as a possible predictor of the adjuvant therapy that is most effective in certain patients. Her study demonstrated ways in which chemotherapy can be tailored to the specific patient. The goal of such tailored therapy is that patients can be spared the toxicity and side effects of drugs that they do not actually need. Some of Pritchard's most recent research has to do with Endocrine Therapy combination strategies for the treatment of HR1/HER2‚Äì Advanced Breast Cancer in postmenopausal women. The best sequencing for Endocrine therapy combination treatment has yet to be determined, but there has been much evidence supports some combinations help with first line defense and other combinations work as second line defense. First line therapy for advanced breast cancer patients could either be a combination of fulvestrant and anastrozole or palbociclib and letrozole. Combinations of everoli-mus and extremstane or palbociclib plus fulvestrant are good second-line therapies. With second-line therapy combinations there are some risks for toxicity, which can be controlled by early and regular monitoring. Pritchard also collaborated on a study that looked at different irradiation approaches as primary therapies for early stage breast cancer patients. Pritchard looked at the outcomes of whole breast irradiation with or without additional nodal irradiation in early stage breast cancer patients. Patients were either given whole breast irradiation or whole breast irradiation with additional nodal irradiation. The researchers followed up with patients after ten years. There was no significant difference in the rate of survival between the two treatment groups. However, the group treated with additional nodal irradiation did have a lower incidence of recurring breast cancer. Recent research explores Oncotype DX as a prognostic tool in predicting the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence. Oncotype DX is a genetic recurrence-scoring tool that measures expression of certain genes associated with breast cancer. A higher score indicates a higher chance of recurring cancer. One project, the TAILORx study, uses the Oncotype DX score to gauge the need for adjuvant therapy and to predict the response to such adjuvant chemotherapy treatments. Pritchard was able to confirm Oncotype DX as a useful tool in deciding upon treatment for low scoring patients. Current results are inconclusive as to Oncotype DX's predictive ability for middle scoring patients. Pritchard also explored the effects of HRT on women and the potential for developing breast cancer. HRT is usually given to women who are estrogen deficient or menopausal women to lessen their symptoms of menopause. Through her studies of long-term HRT effects, Pritchard discovered there is a 53% higher risk for women developing cancer with a HRT combination of progesterone and estrogen, but only a 34% higher risk in women who just receive estrogen. Another risk of HRT is its cardiovascular effects such as blood clotting and dense breast tissue making it harder to read a mammogram. Pritchard suggests alternatives to combat estrogen deficiency and menopausal symptoms. Alternatives include Vitamin E, calcium supplements, venlafaxine, clonidine, and diet. She concludes that it may not be as effective, but it does not have the increased risk for breast cancer. Memberships Pritchard was a founding member of the Canadian Oncology Society in 1978 and a founding member of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncology in 1988, serving as its president from 1990 to 1992. She served as Chair and Co-Chair of the Ontario Practice Guidelines Initiative's Breast Cancer Site Group between 1990 and 2002. She served on the Board of Directors for the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2006. Awards and honors In 2005, Pritchard was awarded the O. Harold Warwick Prize by the Canadian Cancer Society for her clinical trials work on breast cancer. In 2015, she was the Scientific Honoree at the 14th Women of Action awards luncheon hosted by the Israel Cancer Research Fund in Toronto. In December 2017, it was announced that Dr. Pritchard has been honoured as a Member of the Order of Canada (CM).https://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=17061&lan;=eng Selected publications  * (with Henri Rochefort)   * *  References  External links * WorldCat Publications list Category:Living people Category:Canadian women physicians Category:Canadian oncologists Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:21st-century Canadian physicians Category:20th- century Canadian women writers Category:20th-century Canadian writers Category:20th-century women scientists Category:21st-century women scientists Category:21st-century women physicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kathleen I.

Members of an anarchist group established the organization in April 1921. Prominent feminists Yamakawa Kikue and Noe It≈ç were advisers for the group, which participated in that year's May Day activities, published the magazine Omedetashi, held seminars and lectures, and distributed anti-war leaflets to the army. Their manifesto condemned capitalism, arguing that it turned women into slaves and prostitutes. The Sekirankai was the first women's socialist association and clashed with Shin Fujin Ky≈çkai (the New Women's Association). The organization dissolved eight months after its creation. History = Founding = The Sekirankai was formed at time in Imperial Japan when socialist thought gained enough momentum to be expressed publicly. The Sekirankai was founded in April 1921 from an anarchist group established by Sakai Magara, Kutsumi Fusako, Hashiura Haruno, and Akizuki Shizue. It was the first women's socialist association. Advisers for the organization were Yamakawa Kikue and Noe It≈ç. The society had about 42 members, 17 of whom were active. As members of the Sekirankai had personal ties with Nihon Shakai Shugi D≈çmei (Japan Socialist League), the organization has been referred to as the \\"women's office\\" of the league. The Sekirankai sought to overthrow the capitalist system. Their platform stated \\"We will fight any form of oppression that keeps us and our brothers and sisters in ignorance, poverty, and positions of subordination.\\" = May Day Protest = One of the first activities of the organization was to plan for that year's May Day, a day adopted by socialist and communist groups to represent International Worker's Day. The previous year's May Day activities, held in Tokyo's Ueno Park, were Japan's first public celebration of May Day and were estimated to include 5000 people. For the event, Yamakawa Kikue drafted a manifesto titled Fujin ni Gekisu (Manifesto to Women) that decried capitalism for engendering imperialism and framed the problems of capitalism from a feminist standpoint, and it the manifesto made into leaflets to be distributed at the event. The manifesto read: Japan's first Labor Day in 1920 About 20 women members of the Sekirankai marched during the May Day activities. They carried red and black flags that were made by Hashiura Haruko and smaller flags painted with \\"R. W.\\" for Red Wave. They paraded through the political meeting. All of the women were arrested. Sensational accounts of the event from journalists resulted in government restrictions on the organization's movements but the women's activities were placed into the national spotlight. During the Mayday demonstration of the following year, women's participants would be seen all over the country. = Other Activities = In June 1921, members of the Sekirankai held a lecture on women's issues at Kanda Seinen Kaikan. Yamakawa Kikue, It≈ç Noe, Kutsumi Fusako, Fujimori Seikichi, Sakai Magara, Eguchi Kan, and Ishikawa Sanshir≈ç were lecturers at the meeting. In July, the Sekirankai held a five-day seminar and published the magazine Omedetashi (Auspicious Magazine). In October 1921, they participated in the Guntai Sekka Jiken (Communization of the Army Incident) and distributed anti- war leaflets to the army through the mail. = Conflicts with the New Women's Association = The Sekirankai were also critical of their fellow Japanese women's organization, Shin Fujin Ky≈çkai (New Women's Association), formed in 1920. The _Sekirankai_ found the bourgeois nature of the New Women's Association to be antithetical to the cause of women's rights, and Yamakawa offered harsh criticisms in an article for the July 1921 issue of Taiy≈ç, \\"The New Women's Association and the Red Wave Society.\\" She wrote there that \\"Revolution is essential for women. Only the Sekirankai can provide the answer.\\" The article alone would have been a blow to the New Women's Association, but the timing of it made the impact even more profound, as the article appeared right on the tail of prominent New Women's Association leader Ichikawa Fusae's resignation from the organization. In the article, Yamakawa focused her criticism on New Women's Association leader Hiratsuka Raich≈ç, believing that the group focused solely on the problems of upper-class women while ignoring the harsh realities that working class women faced. = Dissolution = By the end of 1921, the activities of the Sekirankai had come to a halt. At the time, the restrictive Public Order and Police Law of 1900 (Ê≤ªÂÆâË≠¶ÂØüÊ≥ï Chian Keisatsu H≈ç) prohibited worker strikes and labor organizations in a crack down on speech and assembly. Due to Article 5, women in particular were prohibited from attending political meetings or joining political organizations. In addition to this governmental oppression, pressure from the public eye was a powerful detractor. Throughout newspapers, feminist and socialist societies were vilified as degenerates and were the object of derision for numerous cartoonists such as Okamoto Ippei and Kitazawa Rakute. This created a distrust of these kinds of organizations within the public consciousness, and those who may have otherwise been swayed to join found themselves averse to the idea. This public criticism combined with the governmental oppression and the animosity of other women's organization to contribute to the dissolution of the organization in December, only eight months after it was founded. Many members of the organization went on to form spin-off groups such as the discussion group Suiy≈çkai (Wednesday Society) and the organization Y≈çkakai (Eighth Day Society), which would continue to carry Sekirankai ideals.  Ideology  The group approached feminism through a Marxist lens, exploring the problems that women faced as issues of class and commodification. Much of the group's ideological tenets found root in the writings of Yamakawa Kikue, a Japanese feminist and socialist writer who was also a prominent member of the Sekirankai. Under these Marxist lines of thought, the Sekirankai believed that economic independence was a crucial step in achieving gender parity; however, according to their manifesto, they believed that the abolition of capitalism in favor of socialism was a prerequisite for this.

It dates from the 11th century. Location The Andone castrum was built in the medieval diocese of Angoul√™me. It is now to the south of the Boixe forest, but in the 10th century the forest was much larger, and began no more than away. It is about to the east of Montignac on the Charente River, which meanders from north to south. It lay to the north of the great road from Saintes via Limoges to Lyon, which crossed the Charente at Montignac. The castrum is in an isolated location on a natural mound known as the \\"butte de la Garenne\\". The site was occupied by an Iron Age necropolis, and then by a Gallo-Roman villa. The villa was abandoned in the 4th century. History Around 950 Angoul√™me went through a disturbed period as the Carolingian political structures disintegrated. Count Guillaume II Taillefer resigned his power as Count of Angoul√™me. around 945 and became a monk at the Abbey of Saint-Cybard. He left a bastard son, Arnaud Manzer, but was succeeded by his cousin, Count Bernard of P√©rigord. After Bernard's death in 962 there was a power struggle between Bernard's sons and Arnaud Manzer. Arnaud established himself of Count of Angoul√™me in 975. It seems that he reoccupied Andone during this period of struggle. The site was most likely occupied from around 970‚Äì980 until 1028. The site may have been abandoned in part due to lacks of an interior water supply or to the cramped interior. More important, the transfer of the count's residence to Montignac, on the banks of the Charente, may have been due to the count's wish to ally himself to the bishop who controlled that area. The move seems to have taken place at the same time as the move of the monastery of Saint-Amant-de-Boixe, which had been close to Andone. The site has been relatively undisturbed since being abandoned. Between 1971 and 1995 Andr√© Debord undertook an investigation of the castrum. His findings were reviewed, reinterpreted and published in 2009 under the direction of Luc Bourgeois. The excavation gives useful insights into daily life around the year 1000 in an aristocratic home. The fort has been classified Monument historique since 13 August 1986. Structure The fortification was surrounded by a stone wall, around which there was a walkway, then a large U-shape ditch up to wide. It was thought by Debord that there may have been a second moat, but this has been shown to be incorrect. The surrounding woods contained oak, beech and maple, which were used indiscriminately for fuel. The woods had clearings for pasture or crops. The stone wall was jointed with mortar, and may have had a walkway on top protected by a parapet. The wall was protected by an earth rampart on the outside. The irregular oval outline of the wall, in 14 juxtaposed sections, conforms to the shape of the hill. The remains of the wall are about wide but rise no more than above their foundations. They may have originally been high. There were two gates, wide, giving access to the enclosed space from the east and the west. The enclosure was about in area and held seven stone buildings and two courts. In the northeast there was a long room connected to two others, which appears to have been the base of the ducal hall. There was no fireplace on the ground floor, so there may have been a second-floor room above, about . The ground level would have been a service area. In the south there were four buildings, of which three shared the same facade. The function of the smaller buildings to the south is not clear, but they may have been used for workshops, storage and for housing the count's staff. The stone construction is unusual, since most buildings of that period in France were of wood, other than the great royal residences. File:ANDONE vue depuis l'est.jpgView from the east in 2004, ducal hall to the right Game pieces, now preserved in the Mus√©e d'Angoul√™me Lifestyle Findings include coins, tools, weapons, many horse fittings, small glass vessels, flat glass plates, furniture of stone, bone and wood, ceramic vessels and small earthenware objects. There is evidence of weaving and a smithy, with abundant metal objects. These include ironwork from doors, furniture and chests. The weapons do not include swords or lances, and suggest hunting rather than combat. Locally made chess pieces give evidence of an aristocratic lifestyle. 80% of the domestic animals used for meat were pigs, the remainder being cattle and sheep. Wild game accounted for 4% of the total, including deer (63%), hare (20%), birds (10%) and wild boar (6%). The remains of four horses and seven donkeys were found, as well as a few bones of dog, squirrel, badger, cats and black rats, which were numerous.

He has two children, Terry Michael Emmert, who is vice president of Emmert International, and Christine Vessey, the Vice President of Multrec Corporation.Touchdown Terry: Clackamas County tycoon Terry Emmert is bringing pro football players to Portland.

The company specializes in the most massive and heavy-hauling and rigging projects in the world moving everything from houses to airplane engines.Emmert International Company Information =Sports ownership= An avid sports fan, Emmert began dabbling in the world of professional sports. In 2002, he and his close friend former Portland Trail Blazers legend Clyde Drexler worked on finalizing a deal to purchase the Portland Fire of the WNBA after that franchise had three bad seasons under the ownership of then (and current) Blazers owner Paul Allen. Unfortunately, Drexler, Emmert and the WNBA could not come to a deal to finalize the sale of the franchise and it eventually folded. Portland Chinooks Emmert was the principal owner of the Portland Chinooks of the International Basketball League. He bought the team due in part to his problems with the ABA's Portland Reign, yet did not escape problems with the Chinooks in his attempt to bring minor league hoops to Portland. His choice to have home games played at Portland's Eastmoreland Racquet Club created a furor among members, and forced the Chinooks to find a new venue for the team's second season (this decision was also influenced by the need for a larger venue). Portland Thunder In 2013, Emmert finalized a deal with the Arena Football League to purchase the franchise rights to the Milwaukee Mustangs team and relocate them to Portland. The deal was finalized and the team became the Portland Thunder and began play at the Moda Center on March 17, 2014 against the San Jose SaberCats (televised on CBS Sports Network). Emmert's franchise is the second AFL team to play in Portland after the now-defunct Portland Forest Dragons. His team made the playoffs twice with 5‚Äì13 records, yet fired its coaches in each of the first two seasons. On January 6, 2016, the AFL announced that it had taken over operations of the Thunder from Emmert.League Takes Over Operations of Portland Thunder, ArenaFootball.com, January 6, 2016 He told the Portland Tribune newspaper that the future of the team was up in the air because he was concerned with the league's medical insurance policies and was hoping to try and attract more investors to help fund the team.Thunder's AFL future up in the air, Kerry Eggers, Portland Tribune, January 1, 2016 This prompted league officials and the board of directors to take control of the franchise and look for new owners.Arena Football League Takes Ownership of Portland Thunder Away From Terry Emmert, Aaron Mesh, Willamette Week, January 6, 2016 However, Emmert had trademarked all logos, the colors and the \\"Thunder\\" name, similar to what Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had done with the Dallas Desperados. Thus the AFL has no alternative but to create a new franchise with a new identity.AFL Commissioner Butera promises 'outstanding team' for Portland in 2016, Steve Brandon, Portland Tribune, February 3, 2016 His former franchise would soon be rebranded the Portland Steel under the league's ownership. The Steel folded in October 2016. This may open the door for Emmert to take his identity to another league, likely the Indoor Football League much like former AFL/af2 teams in the past such as the Green Bay Blizzard, Tri-Cities Fever, Iowa Barnstormers and Spokane Shock. (The Shock would later become the Spokane Empire due to trademark issues with the AFL's Shock identity.) This is only if the current Portland AFL franchise folds after the 2016 season or beyond.

Basic income charity is run in the small community of Quatinga Velho in Brazil. History \\"The independent basic income program, in line with the principles of universality and unconditionality, began 25 October 2008 in Quatinga Velho, Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil. All local residents in the community were informed that they would get the money regularly without any discrimination or requirement to reciprocate, as long as they wanted to take part in the pilot. The project was originally expected to last for one year and pay a monthly amount of R$30,00 to 27 members of this community. However, at the meeting in November, the consortium decided to continue the project for another year. After 15 months, the project paid unconditional income to 67 residents of Quatinga Velho.\\" ‚ÄúRecivitas has been running a privately funded basic income for a small, impoverished rural community in the state of S√£o Paulo, Brazil for three years now. Recivitas was founded and is run by Bruna Augusto Pereira and Marcus Vinicius Brancaglione. The project pays 30 Brazilian Reais (about US$15) per month to people in the community of Quatinga Velho, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. This amount of money sounds very small to people from industrialized countries, but it has a large impact in a rural area of Brazil. The coordinators have verified gains in nutrition, clothing, living conditions, health (especially in children), construction of new housing, and improvements to existing ones. In informal interviews, the coordinators have noticed increased self-esteem and social interaction, reduction of social insecurity, and rising expectations of the future, especially regarding children. They noted that they have not observed increased use of alcohol or illicit drugs; significant changes in labor relations, birth, migration or emigration, or generation of political relations and economic dependency. Although the project leaders are examining the effects of the local basic income, the coordinators of the project told USBIG that the point of the project is not to study BIG. They are already convinced that model has been proven effective; they want to put it into practice. The goal is to put the policy in place. If governments are not ready to do it on a national scale with tax funding, Recivitas is attempting to do it on a small scale with private funding. Theses and results \\"The basic income model should be consistent with the libertarian spirit, should be formulated not as aid but as a universal human right to social security. So we make a cash transfer project, conceived as integrated pedagogical process, in which the community changing is the school, combining the security of vital political emancipation and cultural transformation. Model based: on direct democracy, radical transparency - where all the funds collected are passed on to beneficiaries, and community self-determination - designed as a social networking site formed by the mutual recognition of the residents and not delimited by geopolitical boundaries or others. Even with the benefit of low- riding, the first results were observed by the third month of the project. Verified: gains in nutrition, clothing and living conditions and health, especially in children, construction of new housing and/or improvements to existing ones. In general, the use of income stuck to buying basic needs, although some families have the time to plan the use of the benefit using the resource in microenterprises, included poorer families. It was also noticed increased self-esteem and social interaction, reduction of social insecurity, and rising expectations of the future, especially regarding children. Was not observed: increased use of alcohol or illicit drugs; significant changes in labor relations, birth, migration or emigration justified by the basic income, or generation of political relations and economic dependency, whether in relation to basic income, or the filmmakers the project. You can still see increased integration and community participation, with significant impact on measurements of social capital.\\" Conclusions \\"From experience, it is observed that the value of the amount is not only subjective or relative to cost of living location. There is a reason, in which the value of the amount of basic income is comparatively higher for those who need more of the same. For the same reason that there is less private interest, but not the collective, participate in the project to those with higher purchasing power, implying that the particular interest in taking part of this program is proportional to the subjective valuation of the basic income. This proportional ratio between need and allows evaluation, self-governing or participating projects, the focus of the audience by setting the amount of basic income, they may be rightly prioritize the poor without the undesirable effects of conditionalities. Procedure more efficient, economical and unbureaucratic to fight poverty and promote social security, avoiding the evils of discrimination and segregation, as well as the associated operational costs. We also observed a negative relationship between uncertainty and the perspective on life - understood as a psychological phenomenon corresponding to the very opening of the horizon of possibilities of the person, the basic income and the ability to act directly in the social and psychological phenomenon, promoting human and economic development while generating social capital and financial security, trust and perspectives needed to free enterprise, responsibility and entrepreneurship. Constituting themselves as a possible foundation for solidarity economy, just to leverage social technologies such as microcredit. We conclude that the method employed was the key to the extrapolated results to material improvement. The model applied suggests the possibility of enabling the basic income scale replication and propagation in the network via the integrated civil societies, if strategically applied economic centers to the suburbs, can become an instrument of pragmatic policies, governmental or otherwise, to eradicate extreme poverty and empowerment. The study also suggests the possibility of enabling the Basic Income by social pact and associations, banking and financial models, avoiding taxation.\\" Conditional x unconditional \\"(...) Mathias Rudolph (2010) obtained this exact consequence as one of the results of his research. The residents of Quatinga Velho noticed that the existence of the BIG project improved the level of participation by the residents of the community. That is, what it was a disperse group became a community. Many are the examples of the project, even if it is a small scale initiative, attending almost 90 people. They are examples collected by ReCivitas itself and confirmed in field analysis and by the independent study of Mathias Rudolph, which prove the bonding capacity of BIG and its capacity of becoming and a safety net for those involved. The certainty of BIG, regardless of the family‚Äôs socioeconomic status or of the ability to comply with conditions allowed those involved to develop and implement plans. There are cases such as the mother who was able to set BIG aside for the development and growth of her small daughter, without compromising the household expenses. Such as the two young men who were able to buy a motorbike together to move around between the farms where they work. The example of the woman who discovered she had chronic health problems and was able to go to the doctor and buy medicines for her monthly treatment. The mother who could save her son from pneumonia, with the purchase of medicines. The mother who buys her medicine in installments from the city pharmacist, who knows about her right and about the certainty of the BIG, in the same way as the local grocery owner. The families who were able to feed their children with meat and fruit, to give them school supplies, clothing. The mothers who had better pregnancies with babies born without malnutrition, which used to be so frequent. The child who can read today for 15 having glasses. The families who built their houses, vegetable gardens, cages, chicken coops. Who paid their debts with banks. The difference, therefore, between a conditioned program and the unconditional citizen's income goes far beyond normative structures or different theoretical conditions. The non-conditionality allows a result that was not only not reached by a program with conditions, but even prejudiced.\\" Social capital \\"In opposite to surveys in industrial countries the participation in social capital surveys in development countries is almost 100 per cent ‚Äì so in rural S√£o Paulo. In Quatinga Velho neighbourhood in all forms seems to be the most important social common. The time dedicated to others outside the family without being paid is more than the average working time per capita in many developed countries. This represents an enormous asset to maintain, to develop and to grow. The recently published World Giving Index ranked Brazil No. 76* and published the following table: Brazil Chile Haiti Colombia Percentage giving money 25 48 40 24 Percentage Volunteering time 15 16 38 20 Percentage helping a stranger 49 49 35 63 The database of the World Giving Index is the result of a Gallup survey with samples in all states. The poor result for Brazil ‚Äì only 15 per cent of the people provide volunteering time ‚Äì can not be testified by our survey. In opposite it seems that volunteering defined as help for neighbours is the major social common. (‚Ä¶)The BIC project in Quating Velho shows, that providing a Basic Income may be the cheaper solution with a better effect on the local social capital and commons.\\" Conclusions from coordinators =Possibilities= \\"The possibilities opened by the first experience we emphasize those with the greatest potential for innovation: 1.focusing by value; 2. the validity of a Basic Income in nature; 3. feasibility of a non-governmental Basic Income. Although not used as a criterion to prioritize the most needy, self-management systems, you can use the definition of value to promote a gradual strategic expansion of a real BI focused on the poorest; perfectly consistent, therefore, the principle of unconditionality, since there could be no discriminatory process or impediment to any person of a particular community would receive the BI from the manifestation of his will. As the focus value is not required to segregate the same community, or make any kind of \\"triage\\" of the poor to prioritize them. However, we should not pulverize the same BI for a large territory. First, because the focus value has its efficiency reduced by the greater variation between the costs of life in the same location - being much more functional when applied in different ways for each community or local economy. And second, because, taking into account that social inequality tends to be reflected also in the geographical distribution of wealth, we can make a much more efficient use of resources by directing them to the neediest areas, or more specifically providing priority to locations with greater social risk, the resources needed for training and provision of new communities protected by Basic Income. This way if allying with the value in targeting communities self-determined democratically with a strategic plan designed from the core of geo-referencing the poorest, we have the possibility of using the model developed in QV to make an accelerated plan for the eradication of poverty, more efficient and effective in both developed socioeconomic point of view, as also human. Still in the strategic point of view that spread through the multiplication of communities nuclei added to the focus value is much more feasible than the expected formation of a majority and only then begin execution of an unconditional Basic Income. So the reason that validates the value focus - namely: participation in the system is derived from the comparative value of Basic Income with the earnings of each individual - is the realization of a BI which value is not irrelevant for everyone, a valid action for gradually reaching a Basic Income either closer to the ideal the more significant this is becoming to a growing number of people - first because of the relative and subjective value of their amounts, and then due to the widespread perception of their security-productive effects, for the whole society. The project opens the possibility of establishing a system to redistribute income that is not played or rather monopolized by government institutions, not necessarily supported by their taxes, or any kind of monopoly. Formed through new social contracts executed automatically from banking systems, the proposition that the Basic Income can be implemented systematically by free enterprise within the market from banking systems contracted by collectives or individuals who recognize their common interests, not flees in absolute definition of a Basic Income, on the contrary adds a key component of its empirical definition, providing in an integrated way provision and financing: the free system of equal contributions of all income, for the provision of an equal BI for all, strictly a social contract before a government program or nongovernmental.\\" =Understanding= \\"Occasionally these are the most significant changes provoked in our understanding of the experience. Concepts that not only reflected in the methodology, but influenced the strategic guidance and policy for the achievement of the BI. They are: i. The need for a democratic place for the existence of a genuine Basic Income; ii. The perception of the political community with social networking site regardless of geopolitical boundaries; iii. The legitimacy and necessity of civil society organizations to carry out new policies; iv. The importance of direct democracy and self-determination for the full exercise of citizenship; v. The need to discuss social action and educational process, not segregated from daily life; vi. The understanding of human development from the expansion of life perspectives; vii. And finally the measurability of the social contract, or more specifically the quality of systems to accomplish it through: a. Measure effectiveness by ensuring real freedoms as fundamental rights equal; b. Effectiveness measured by re-distribution of enforcement of fundamental rights; c. And efficiency is measured from the operational effectiveness compared to economy.\\" =Means= We emphasize those of the developed methods that were the key to the success of the experience and consolidation of a model capable of replication: i. Self-determination for mutual recognition; ii. Self-management for direct democracy; iii. And the pedagogy of inspiration; Each of these methods as a product corresponding to the respective approach taken in the same order: i. The libertarian understanding of BI; ii. The identification of the community as a network; iii. The vision of the project as integrated pedagogical process. As we have said we do not deny that the methodology has influence on the results, but also reaffirm that the congruence between the object and its method is itself inseparable from the empirical definition, and determining not only the fulfilment of the purpose of the process or system, but the character and authenticity of the program or project. The congruence between the principles and methods is not only fundamental to achieving the goal, or only determinant of the degree of correspondence between the object and its primary concepts or theoretical, is the foundation that defines the process, or more precisely the principle that is indeed. Something that involves serious objections to a Basic Income unconditional initiatives within authoritarian regimes. A Basic Income can even exist within a weak democratic, authoritarian or populist, but not exactly under the responsibility of such a scheme, but as the product of free civil society initiative. Being the way, democratic self-management. The disintermediation that requires not only the power of individual and collective decision, but freedom of information and self-determination - essential to the exercise of fundamental rights to life and liberty that the BI is proposed to supply. In addition to self-management on the direct democracy, the self-determination for mutual recognition also proved a very effective method to identify and secure community and their integration, being the trigger for the exercise of the first decisions through direct democracy and even the constituent element of the community network. In its turn, this approach to the audience as a social network, was the key to the formation of QV as a real political community rather than mere location, this not only allowed to overcome the distortions generated by harnessing land ownership or proof of residence but also most well social connections consolidated settled on trust and reciprocity, to achieve an essential any system based on freedom and that aims for true democracy. Furthermore, considering that a community network not only focuses on social relations, but the link that connects people composing their relations, had the design of the project as a learning process approach to promotes the construction of meanings shared that make up the community connections. Just as direct democracy, the so-called pedagogy of inspiration was not only an added value to the project, but a constituent element of BI, that by taking part of its constitution in fact, also became part of the model developed in the experience of QV for practical design of the BI. Acted as absolutely essential for practical configuration of Basic Income, as the method by which they gave: the knowledge of the meaning of the Basic Income, the direction of the project, and the character of its agents. The project design as a libertarian and critical pedagogical process, not only saved the incorporation of conventional educational processes to fulfill the function of providing the necessary knowledge about the BI, but provided that the project will develop as its method of education for citizenship, mediated by experiences of social transformations and questions inherent in this - both about their reasons, and their results.\\" Some related impacts of experiment =Use of income= ‚ÄúThe of people not spending incomes responsibly leading to a preference of state transfers ‚Äúin kind‚Äù or pegged to certain conditionality, is empirically defeated: very poor households with little access to paid work, have been shown to spend money received on basic consumption goods and education and healthcare for family members (Schubert, 2005; ReCivitas, 2009), well capable of taking strategic decisions on how to improve family livelihood in the medium and long term through responsible spending patterns (Standing, 2008).‚Äù -Alice Krozer, \\"A regional basic income: towards the eradication of extreme poverty in Central America\\".

Children especially enjoy this QV benefit. The project ReCivitas succeeded with the use of extremely limited financial resource, to achieve significant social effects. Should be emphasized the positive impacts to the satisfaction of basic needs and quality of life of the project participants. The results indicate that the BI has contributed to sustainable development in QV. The effects were convincing, particularly in the area of assurance of basic needs, improving the quality of life and social skills.\\" Mathias Rudolph, Leuphana Universit√§t L√ºneburg, 2010. =Direct democracy= \\"Eligibility for recognition in the assembly model is preferable in small communities where social control is possible. Although the rules are not always clear and objective, it just allows in one hand, complex deliberations and decisions \\"case by case\\", and secondly, a drastic reduction of costs of legislation and supervision (Pereira; dos Santos & dos Santos Neto, 2009, p. 5). Furthermore, this model for determining eligibility in the assembly is closer to the emancipation policy pursued by BI.

This was the only fatal incident involving a Tu-114. A committee investigating the accident found that the crash was due to multiple human failures. Accident On 16 February at 23:35 pm the crew of flight 65 were preparing for departure and received a weather report of visibility , with mist, light snow and a relative humidity of 100 percent. Recent snow had been cleared from the runway but not from its full width. A strip approximately wide had been plowed down the center of the concrete runway leaving snow deep along the runway edges. The visibility minimum for takeoff of a TU-114 was . At 1:37 am the aircraft crew radioed the control tower requesting the actual visibility and the controller reported . The controller later testified that he counted the runway edge lights he could see looking down the runway. He believed the distance between these lights to be when in fact it was . At 1:38 am the aircraft began its take-off roll one degree to the right of the runway center line. Approximately 30 seconds later the aircraft was down the runway when the crew realized they were approaching the plowed snow on the right edge and overcorrected to the left four degrees. When the aircraft reached , down the runway the pilot rotated the nose wheels off the ground. At a distance of meters from the beginning of the runway, accelerating through , the left main landing gear entered the deep snow, causing the aircraft to yaw left and pitch down. The left main gear then impacted a runway edge light. Instead of aborting the take-off the pilot banked right, striking the propellers of engines 3 and 4 on the runway. The aircraft then spun to the right, flipped over and burst into flames. The forward fuselage and main wing section were completely destroyed. The force of the impact tore away the tail section and it came to rest inverted separated from the burning forward section. Many of the survivors were seated in this part of the aircraft. Aircraft The accident aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-114 with aircraft registration CCCP 76491 and manufacturer's serial number 64M472. The airliner was manufactured in 1964, delivered to Aeroflot on 12 December of that year and entered service on 18 November 1965; it was the last Tu-114 produced. At the time of the accident it had accumulated 93 hours with 19 take-off/landing cycles, and flown approximately . Investigation In a report released 12 May 1966 the investigating board indicated the main cause of the crash were errors made by the aircraft crew and poor organization of the airport traffic control service. Contributing factors included limited visibility in poor weather conditions and failure to properly clear the runway of snow.

Personal life Vivian Perlis was born in Brooklyn, New York. After growing up in Long Island, N.Y., she attended the University of Michigan, studying classical harp and piano. In addition to her bachelor's degree, she earned a master's degree in music history at the University of Michigan (BM 1949, MM 1952). She was also an enrolled as a doctoral student at Columbia University between 1962-1964). During this time she also taught music history at a number of college throughout New England. Vivian eventually moved to Westport, Connecticut with her husband, Dr. Sanford J. Perlis, and three children. While performing as a harpist with the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, she took a job as a reference librarian at Yale University in 1959. She died on July 4, 2019 at the age of 91.Obituary of Vivian L. Perlis Willowbrook Cemetery. Retrieved 6 July 2019. Oral history career As a music librarian for Yale, Perlis worked with The Charles Ives Papers. In 1968, she had an opportunity to interview the elderly Julian Myrick, Ives‚Äô insurance business partner. Recognizing the profound usefulness of recorded memories such as these, Perlis began collecting interviews with other acquaintances of Charles Ives. These amounted to sixty-two tapes and transcripts. In 1974, Perlis used this collection to write the book Charles Ives Remembered, which was the first documentation of a musical figure through the use of oral history. In 1975, the book won the American Musicological Society's Otto Kinkeldey Award, their most prestigious book award. Perlis was the first female recipient, and this was the first time the award was given for an American musical subject. The book was also honored with the Connecticut Book Publishers Award. While conducting her Ives research, Perlis recognized the value of oral history to document musical figures, and she founded the Oral History of American Music (formerly Oral History, American Music) in 1969. Perlis and composer Aaron Copland first became friends while working on the Ives project. Copland later wrote the preface for her book, Charles Ives Remembered. As the Ives project finished, Perlis focused on Copland as her new subject. From 1975-‚Äô76, she conducted many hours of interviews with Copland and those closest to him. Finally in 1984 and 1989, their efforts culminated in the autobiographies, Copland: 1900 through 1942 and Copland: Since 1943, co-authored by Perlis. Oral History of American Music (OHAM) holds over 2,200 interviews and transcripts and is a special collection within Yale University‚Äôs Irving S. Gilmore Music Library. The core unit, Major Figures in American Music, includes interviews with composers, classical performers, and jazz musicians. OHAM also holds projects on Ives, Paul Hindemith, Steinway & Sons, and Duke Ellington, video interviews with Yale graduate composers, and acquisitions. In 2005, Perlis released a new book, Composers‚Äô Voices From Ives to Ellington, which was co-written with Libby Van Cleve. The book celebrates 20th century composers and includes two CDs of interview material. Perlis announced her retirement from Oral History of American Music in 2010. She died at her home in Weston, Connecticut on July 4, 2019 at the age of 91, following an illness. Media production Preceding the success of Charles Ives Remembered, Perlis produced and wrote the liner notes for Charles Ives, the 100th Anniversary, a five-record set, which includes excerpts of Perlis‚Äô oral history interviews. The box set was nominated for the Grammy Awards' Best Classical Album in 1975. Then, in 1977, Perlis was historical consultant to the PBS Ives documentary, A Good Dissonance Like a Man. This documentary also used excerpts from her oral history interviews. In the next thirteen years, Perlis went on to write and produce three documentaries about other oral history subjects and interviewees for the PBS American Masters Series: Memories of Eubie (Eubie Blake; 1980), Aaron Copland: A Self Portrait (1985), and John Cage: I Have Nothing to Say and I Am Saying It (1990).

Due to several conflicts, including low occupancy, the facility closed in 1893. The building was subsequently used as the seat of the Utah State Legislature, as a hotel, as officer's quarters in WW2, then finally as a private club until it was demolished in 1985. History The Industrial Christian Home Association was founded by Angie Newman in March 1886. Newman, a member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, was a resident of Nebraska when she became aware of polygamy in Utah while visiting relatives there in 1876. She was determined to provide a safe haven for women in polygamous marriages, and by 1883 had financial backing from the Methodist Episcopal Woman's Home Missionary Society. When she eventually parted ways with the missionary society, Newman teamed up with women who were largely Protestant and ex-members of the defunct Ladies Anti- Polygamy Society (or the Womans National Anti-polygamy Society), including among their number the active Jennie Anderson Froiseth, editor of The Anti- Polygamy Standard. Representing the group before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor in Washington D. C., Newman applied for federal funds and was successful in securing an initial $40,000. The Industrial Christian Home opened in a temporary location in December 1886, overseen by a Congressionally appointed \\"Board of Control\\" (the Utah Commission), headed by territorial governors Eli H. Murray and Caleb Walton West. A dispute ensued when the women challenged who should administer the financial oversight. Newman appealed for intervention directly to President Grover Cleveland, who delegated the request to the Secretary of the Interior. Difficulties between the board and the staff caused organizational problems, which were exacerbated by Mormon attempts to discredit the whole enterprise. A total of 154 applications were made in the first nine months, most of which were refused by the board, who reasoned that monogamous wives, first wives, and children of polygamists would not be helped by the home. Mission staff restricted access to those whose marriages they considered illegal ‚Äì second and third wives. Also excluded were those who refused polygamy, or indeed Mormonism as a whole. In 1888‚Äì1889 Congress approved funds for an elaborate new home. An additional appropriation of $80,000 ($75,000 for building and $5,000 for contingent expenses) paid for the construction of a large building at 145 South 500 East in Salt Lake City. The home opened in June 1889. It never had enough residents to fill its capacious accommodation. It closed in 1893. Later uses of the building Briefly the building was the home of the Utah legislature. Afterwards it became a residential hotel ‚Äì the Fifth East Hotel. During World War II it housed military officers. In 1945 it became the Ambassador Athletic Club. The building was demolished in 1985.

The fictitious speaker of this pamphlet, Andrew Moreton, is a man in his sixties who offers suggestions for the improvement of London. In particular, he fosters the establishment of a university, an academy of music, a hospital for foundlings and licensed institutions for the treatment of mental diseases. Moreover, he encourages the introduction of measures to prevent moral corruption and street robbery. Augusta Triumphans is part of a group of works which were issued under the nom-de-plume of Andrew Moreton. It includes also Every-body's Business, Is No-body's Business (1725), The Protestant Monastery (1726), Parochial Tyranny (1727), and Second Thoughts are Best (1729). They respectively deal with high salary of servants, disrespect towards elders, corruption of parishes, and crime prevention. They all revisit themes which their author, Daniel Defoe, had already discussed in An Essay Upon Projects (1697). Compared to this earlier work, however, they are more project-oriented than focused on moral criticism. As Maximillian Novak points out, Defoe chose a \\"grand title\\" for Augusta Triumphans. It highlights his ambitious aim of making London stand out even at a universal level. This city has a significant role in both his biography and work. Firstly, his travels started and ended in this place. Secondly, it is \\"the implicit or explicit setting\\" of the majority of his writings. Subject and overall structure Beer Street and Jin Lane (1751) by William Hogarth Augusta Triumphans offers suggestions for the enhancement of the city of London. It begins with two introductory paragraphs. The former is a brief reflection on ‚Äúprojecting heads‚Äù and the attitude of the English towards them.‚ÄúProjecting heads‚Äù, that is to say individuals who create schemes for social improvement, are invited to make proposals without fearing to be ridiculed. They should exclusively focus on offering honest advice. In addition, the possible shortcomings of their projects should be forgiven in that ‚ÄúIt is a kind of good action to mean well, and the intention ought to palliate the failure‚Äù. As for the English, they are described as the least clement nation towards such individuals. They ‚Äútreat them in the vilest manner‚Äù and it is because of this reason that their country is ‚Äúesteemed so bad at invention‚Äù. In the second opening paragraph, the narrator explains the reason why he has written this pamphlet. He wants to make good use of the remaining time of his life by putting innovative proposals down on paper. On the whole, this work is intended to be the ‚Äútestimony of‚Äù his ‚Äúgood will to‚Äù his ‚Äúfellow-creatures‚Äù. Immediately after this introductory discourse, Andrew Moreton moves on to illustrate the project upon which he has reflected most. He fosters the establishment of a London university to oppose the contemporary corruption of learning and education. Subsequently, four titled sections come one after the other and present other schemes for social improvement. Section one calls for the establishment of a foundling hospital. It would prevent many mothers from freeing themselves of their illegitimate offspring through abortion or abandonment in parishes which do not offer them decent living conditions. Section two shows how a real academy of music would \\"prevent the expensive importation of foreign musicians, & c\\". Section three firstly offers advice to rescue \\"youths and servants\\" from moral corruption. Secondly, it denounces certain social evils: prostitution, gambling, and a series of dissolute manners to spend one's free time on Sunday such as alcohol misuse. Thirdly, it makes a digression on husbands's abuses of their wives and comments about contemporary private madhouses. Section four encourages the adoption of measures to stop street robbery. They include moral education and the introduction of a competent and paid body of watchmen as well as an adequate system of street lighting at night. The final part of Augusta Triumphans is titled ‚ÄúOmissions‚Äù. It is a revision of two aspects of the projects which have been illustrated so far. Andrew Moreton begins with rejecting his initial idea of founding a London university composed of ‚Äúonly a hall or public room‚Äù. Rather, ‚Äúit should be a large house or inn, in the nature of a college, with store of convenient rooms for gentlemen, not only to study separately, but wherein to lodge their books, for it would be most inconvenient to lug them backwards and forwards‚Äù. He then expands his ‚Äúdiscourse on madhouses‚Äù, particularly by offering a suggestion to impede the unjust confinement of widows or other women who find themselves with a fortune and no male guidance. In order to prevent them from becoming victims of greedy and manipulatory ‚Äústrangers‚Äù, the nearest male relative should succeed the deceased gentleman in the management of the estate. At the end of the pamphlet is attached a letter ‚ÄúTo Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Robinson‚Äù which is dated ‚ÄúSept. 23, 1728‚Äù. Its signatory, Andrew Moreton, begins with briefly congratulating the addressee for his ‚Äúelection into the chamberlainship of the city of London‚Äù. He subsequently poses a series of questions to understand the purpose of ‚Äúthe orphan‚Äôs tax‚Äù.  ‚ÄúSchemists‚Äù and their time The theme of human capability to project is touched upon at the beginning of Augusta Triumphans when Andrew Moreton briefly comments on ‚Äúschemists‚Äù. These figures are mentioned also in An Essay Upon Projects. In its introduction, the author points out that his country ‚Äúswarms with [‚Ä¶] a multitude of‚Äù planners. This project-oriented climate originates from the widespread need to cope with contemporary problems and chaos. Moreover, since no other age was characterised by such a trend, his epoch could be defined as a ‚ÄúProjecting Age‚Äù. Daniel Defoe dealt with ‚Äúthe theme of [‚Ä¶] man‚Äôs capacity to project‚Äù also in An Essay Upon Projects (1697) and Robinson Crusoe (1719). They respectively are an explicit and an implicit treatment of the same topic. In addition to be characterised by opposite approaches, they differ in perspective. An Essay Upon Projects is socially oriented in that it addresses issues which are of importance for a whole community. Robinson Crusoe, on the other hand, focuses on the interests of a single human being. Andrew Moreton's proposals for the improvement of London =The establishment of new institutions= Thomas Coram in front of his Hospital with an Infant by J. Brooke (1751), after B. Nebot (1741) In Augusta Triumphans, Andrew Moreton promotes the foundation of a university, an academy of music and a hospital for foundlings. He begins with calling for a university in London and stresses the reasons for making it non-residential. Firstly, by keep living under the same roof with their families of origin, students are not left to their own devices. and are less likely to fall into temptation. Young men who are sent to Cambridge or Oxford, on the other hand, waste their time drinking rather than learning themselves. Secondly, by daily returning to their family's quarter, they contribute to the cultural flourish of London society; they can spread the academic knowledge they acquire through conversation. Overall, the privileged beneficiary of this plan is the gentry whose residential areas are included in the list of places where Moreton advises establishing colleges: Westminster, St. James and Ormond Street. This social group is also invited to finance the whole project ‚Äúby subscription‚Äù. Subsequently, Andrew Moreton urges the establishment of a foundling hospital. This would prevent many mothers from getting rid of their illegitimate offspring through abortion or abandoning them in parishes which are incapable of offering them adequate shelter. This issue recurs in Defoe‚Äôs other works, particularly in the novels Moll Flanders (1722), Roxana (1724), and in the essay Conjugal Lewdness (1727). In the early eighteenth century, a large number of abandoned children. were either left on the streets of London or put into the care of parishes. However, the latter were not considered reliable. Some dissipated the money which was supposed to be spent on the support of children; others were accused of entrusting orphans to the care of dishonest nurses selected on the basis of the cheapness of the service they provided. Lastly, Defoe‚Äôs fictitious speaker fosters the establishment of an academy of music ‚Äúto prevent the expensive importation of foreign musicians & c.‚Äù. He points out that the then existing Italian opera, which is financed by upper class lovers of this art, is ‚Äúimproperly called academy‚Äù in that it just hires costly foreign musicians. It does not encourage the ‚Äúpropagation of science, by training up persons thereto from younger to riper years, under the instruction and inspection of proper artists‚Äù. When Augusta Triumphans was published, there existed a joint stock company whose denomination was Royal Academy of Music. Founded in 1719, it became operative in 1720. Thanks to governmental subsidies, it could afford to pay salaries which were ‚Äúbeyond the theatre‚Äôs inherent capacity to pay‚Äù. =Preventing the moral corruption of youths and servants= A Harlot's Progress, Plate 1 (1732), etching an engraving by William Hogarth Andrew Moreton encourages the introduction of measures to render servants faithful to their job. Firstly, they should be offered salaries which are not excessively high. In particular, their amount could be set on the basis of their capability of working and managing money. Secondly, the judicial system should not allow them to resign without just cause. Lastly, masters ought not to abuse them. This scheme aims primarily to keep servants away from idleness and bad company that may lead them into vice and crime. Eighteenth-century London was populated by a large number of migrants seeking job opportunities. Being alone and unaware of city dangers, they could easily become pray of unscrupulous people. Young girls, for instance, could be led into prostitution by manipulative individuals approaching them at their arrival. Procurers could take the advantage of ‚Äúthe custom of mistresses to meet the wagons which brought country girls to London in order to find and engage servants‚Äù. According to M. Dorothy George, ‚Äúthe first scene in Hogarth‚Äôs Harlot‚Äôs Progress was one frequently played in real life‚Äù. =Reforming the madhouse system= In the Madhouse - Plate 8 in A Rake's Progress (1735) by William Hogarth Andrew Moreton reflects also upon the contemporary system of private madhouses and denounces its inefficiency. In the first place, he notices that it allows the institutionalisation of individuals who are affected by no mental disease. For instance, they frequently admit healthy wives. confined by abusive husbands for the sole purpose of getting rid of them. In the second place, he points out that they do not guarantee adequate treatment of patients in that their staffs neglect or abuse them. In the light of this, he suggests substituting them with ‚Äúlicensed madhouses‚Äù which are ‚Äúsubject to proper visitation and inspection‚Äù and where nobody can be ‚Äúsent [‚Ä¶] without due reason, inquiry, and authority‚Äù. In the eighteenth century, private madhouses were much discussed. Nicholas Hervey points out that Defoe was ‚Äúamong the first to question the practice of these institutions in Augusta Triumphans (1728)‚Äù. He was late followed by Tobias Smollett who wrote the novel Sir Lancelot Greaves (1762). in which the hero of the title criticises unfair detention in madhouses. and reflects upon the difference between sanity and mental illness. In 1763, the Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine also denounced the abuse of a series of patients in asylums. Nicholas Hervey also notices that Defoe ‚Äúattacked the way husbands were able to confine their wives for the most spurious of reasons‚Äù. This practice was later also denounced by Mary Wollstonecraft in The Wrongs of Woman (1798). On this point, Elizabeth Foyster claims that this ‚Äúwas an issue which caused much concern in eighteenth-century England‚Äù. Men‚Äôs right to confine their wives was frequently debated. In the essay At the Limits of Liberty: Married Women and Confinement in eighteenth- century England (2002), she argues that husbands‚Äô detention of their spouses in family dwellings and madhouses had become a new form of conjugal violence. Her study is based on documents of the King‚Äôs Bench, the court which held jurisdiction over this issue. =Prevention of street robbery= The Idle 'Prentice Executed at Tyburn - plate 11 and The Industrious 'Prentice Mayor of London - plate 12 in Industry and Idleness (1747) by William Hogarth The last scheme of Andrew Moreton aims to prevent street robbery ‚Äúfirst by heavenly, and then by earthly means‚Äù. The former consist in ‚Äúenforcing and encouraging a reformation of manners, by suppressing of vice and immorality, and punishing profaneness and licentiousness‚Äù. Widespread immoral habits are the reading of lustful ballads, swearing, and alcohol abuse. The latter include the introduction of an efficient system of surveillance and lighting of the streets. First of all, it is necessary to substitute the current inept watch with a body of competent and physically strong men. These new guards should carry firearms, swords, and a horn to alert their co-workers. They should be assigned to areas which are not too large to be effectively monitored. In particular, ‚Äúno watchman‚Äù should ‚Äústand above twenty doors distant from his fellow‚Äù. Moreover, they ought to be given salaries in recognition of their efforts. Secondly, streets need to be rendered visible a night. Therefore, it is important to set up a reasonable number of lamps which are technically capable of providing adequate lighting. In this section, Andrew Moreton recalls three peculiar aspects of the culture in Defoe‚Äôs time. The first to be mentioned is the movement for the reformation of manners. Throughout the 18th- century, large numbers of Englishmen denounced what they saw as the high degree of social immorality and the difficulty of prosecuting victimless offences. From 1690 on they gathered and founded a series of Societies. During the early decades they concentrated on organising and conducting the prosecution of targeted sinners. They could take you to court for offences such as drunkenness, swearing, gaming and sodomy. Later their members shifted their attention to teaching religious and moral values through the delivery of sermons and the production and distribution of pamphlets. The second cultural peculiarity is the night watch which existed since the thirteenth century. It consisted of men monitoring the streets during dark hours. It had been introduced to favour safety at night together with the enforcement of rules of curfew. Early criticism about this system date back to the Restoration. Some of its shortcomings were also reported in the city marshals' accounts of the 1690s. They noticed that poor areas could not afford financing this service. Moreover, watchmen would not carry appropriate weapons and, in some cases, would leave before shift ended. In the 1720s, a significant public debate over crime prevention was ongoing and Defoe participated to it through a series of pamphlets. In addition to Augusta Triumphans, he investigated crime in Some Considerations Upon Street Walkers (1726), Street Robbery Consider'd (1728), Second Thoughts Are Best (1729), and An Effectual Scheme for the Immediate Preventing of Street Robberies (1731). Lastly, Andrew Moreton deals with street lighting in connection with night watch. As J. M. Beattie explains, several changes were made to the urban environment of London for the purpose of improving aspects such as paving and the availability of drinkable water. Plans were also made to improve street lighting which, compared to other issues, was considered of the utmost importance to prevent crime. By rendering places visible to both pedestrians and part-time officers, life was made difficult for felons and this point was highlighted in petitions to Parliament. Street lighting eventually became a public system through the Lighting Act of 1736. It was financed by taxes and provided by private companies.

Jones is a research climatologist specializing in the climatology of viticulture, with a focus on how climate variation influences vine growth, wine production and the quality of wine produced. Jones serves as the Director of the Center for Wine Education and is Professor of Environmental Studies at Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon. Previously he served as the Director of the Division of Business, Communication and the Environment at Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon and was Professor in the University's Environmental Science and Policy Program. Background Gregory V. Jones (born 1959 in Murray, Kentucky) obtained a BA (1993) and Ph.D. (1998) in Environmental Sciences with a concentration in the Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Virginia Department of Environmental Sciences. His dissertation described research in Bordeaux, France on the climatology of viticulture investigating the spatial differences in grapevine phenology, grape composition and yield, and how these are related to wine quality. Jones is best known for his research in climatology, meteorology, agriculture and hydrology; the phenology of plant systems; the interaction between biosphere and atmosphere; weather patterns and climate change; and quantitative methods in spatial and temporal analysis. Jones has been invited to speak on climate and wine-related research at hundreds of regional, national and international conferences, and is a well-known applied research consultant to the grape and wine industry in Oregon. In 2014, Jones participated in a panel, A New World of Wine: How the Viticultural Map is Changing at the prestigious Institute of Masters of Wine's 8th annual conference in Florence, Italy. Jones is a regular presenter at the biennial International Terroir Congress, most recently at the Xth International Terroir Congress in Tokaj-Eger, Hungary. As organizer in 2016, Jones brings the XIth International Terroir Congress to the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Research Jones' research focuses on the role of climate in the structure and characteristics of agricultural systems. As such he is interested in how climate influences whether a crop is suitable to a given region, how climate controls crop production and quality and ultimately drives economic sustainability. His main focus on climate's influence on agribusinesses is in viticulture and wine production where climate is arguably the most critical aspect in ripening fruit to optimum characteristics to produce a given wine style. Jones examines climate's role in growing wine grapes and wine production from a holistic perspective trying to understand 1) the weather and climate structure necessary for optimum quality and production characteristics, 2) the climate suitability to different wine grape cultivars, 3) the climate's variability in wine producing regions, and 4) the influence of climate change on the structure, suitability, and variability of climate. Jones' research has been described and his expertise noted in wine trade publications and websites including: Wine & Spirits magazine (May 2015), The Oregonian newspaper (May 2015), Southern Oregon Wine Scene Magazine (Summer 2015), Great Northwest Wine (April 2015), Slate.com (December 2014), Vine2Wine (March 2014), Wine-Searcher (November 2013), Willamette Week newspaper (September 2013), Wines and Vines magazine (November 2012), and the Mail Tribune newspaper (June 2009).

For the next twenty years she performed at Covent Garden, the Haymarket Theatre and Drury Lane. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography summarises her acting career thus: In 1821 she sought an annulment of her marriage, unsuccessfully; she left her husband for William Farren (1786-1861), whom she married in 1853 after her first husband's death. He had two sons, actors Henry Farren (1826?-1860) and William (1825-1908); while the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that these were Harriet's sons, the records of the Garrick Club Collections describe them as the sons of \\"an unknown woman (his first wife?)\\".

Biography Falkowski was born in Pohulanka near Vilnius in 1912. In 1934 he entered to Polish Air Force Academy in Dƒôblin. He was promoted first lieutenant (podporucznik) in October 1936. Then he began his career in Toru≈Ñ. In 1938 he was sent to Dƒôblin as instructor. During the Invasion of Poland, on 3 September 1939, he flew a PZL.26, three German planes attacked him. Falkowski reduced the flight almost to the ground and using aircraft maneuverability caused that one German fighter crashed into the ground, and the other interrupted the attack and turned back, most likely due to the small amount of fuel. After the Soviet invasion of Poland he crossed the border with Romania, then he came to France where he became instructor at Polish School in Lyon‚ÄìBron Airport. On 31 May 1940 he took command of section no. 10. When France capitulated, he arrived in the United Kingdom on 27 June 1940. He was assigned to No. 32 Squadron RAF. He shot down his first plane on 16 January 1941. During the battle, his plane was badly damaged, Falkowski had to jump with a parachute and broke his leg on landing. After treatment he was sent to the No. 315 Polish Fighter Squadron. In August 1941 he downed three Bf 109 over France. In September he scored two victories. On 22 September he became commander of \\"A\\" Flight. He also served in No. 316 Polish Fighter Squadron and No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron. On 30 January 1945 he was named commander of the 3rd Polish Fighter Wing. During one flight over the Netherlands, on 9 March 1945, he was hit by flak, due to the failure of the aircraft, Falkowski had to save himself by jumping with a parachute once again. He was fired upon by the Germans. One of the bullets wounded him in the leg. He was taken POW. On 9 May 1945 he came back to England. After the demobilization in 1947, he settled in Canada and had a farm 20 miles away from Toronto. In the 1960s he wrote an autobiographic book, Z wiatrem w twarz (With the wind in my face), edited in Poland in 1990. Jan Falkowski died on 27 July 2001 in Peterborough, Canada.

Hugh Herbert, Joseph Moncure March and George Beck. The film stars Louise Platt, Donald Woods, Wynne Gibson, Robert Armstrong, Eduardo Ciannelli and Jack La Rue. The film was released on March 15, 1940, by Republic Pictures. Plot Factory worker Judy Wingate financially supports her stepmother Frances, who is keeping company with Eddie Nolan, a gangster. Eddie makes a pass at Judy, who knocks him cold with a skillet. A furious Frances finds Eddie recovering, strikes him again and kills him. But it is Judy who is arrested, convicted and sent to prison for five years. A reporter covering the trial, Dan Donahue, develops a romantic attraction to Judy, who finds prison bearable, at least being far from her wicked stepmother. A guilty conscience persuades Frances, however, to offer $10,000 from Judy's life insurance policy to mobsters Gorno and Mullins to break her out of jail. All spirals downhill from there. Judy threatens to go to the police and tell all she knows. Mullins, angry with Frances, runs her down with a car. On her deathbed, Frances attempts to confess, but Gorno shoots her before she can speak. Donahue and the police, however, are able to get the better of the villains and clear Judy's name once and for all.

It is similar in meaning to the English word Hello. Linguistically Specifically, Jambo is a Swahili language word that belongs to noun classes 5-6 for \\"collectives\\". Jambo primarily means 'affair', in the sense of commercial, professional, public or personal business.Nurse, Derek, and Hinnebusch, Thomas J. Swahili and Sabaki: a linguistic history. 1993. Series: University of California Publications in Linguistics, v. 121. Etymologically it is from amba (-amba) meaning to say. It is a cognate with Zulu. Secondary meanings include dealing with a thing, issue or matter. First use The spoken word \\"Jambo\\" was once used as a greeting among traders of the Swahili coast of southeast Africa. See also: Prins, A.H.J. 1970. A Swahili Nautical Dictionary. Preliminary Studies in Swahili Lexicon ‚Äì 1. Dar es Salaam. While less formal, it is in widespread use in East Africa and beyond.Ashton, E. O. Swahili Grammar: Including intonation. Longman House. Essex 1947. While similar in use to the English word \\"hello,\\" it really meant to come and settle one's affairs in the business sense. It was used by traders from India, China and other lands before the Portuguese Vasco da Gama visited the area in 1498. It is in current use.What is the meaning of Jambo?12 Swahili words to know before traveling in East Africa by Kelly LalondeUseful Swahili Colonial use During the European \\"Scramble for Africa\\" which brought a period of Imperialism and East African European colonialism, the Swahili word \\"Bwana\\" was used to refer to the Europeans.R. Mugo Gatheru (2005) Kenya: From Colonization to Independence, 1888‚Äì1970, McFarland, Briefly the word today refers to as \\"Mister\\" or big boss or an important person and occasionally used in a derogatory manner. But the historical reality of it was simply \\"Master.\\" The British dictionary or older English usage refers the word \\"Master\\" as a male person who is in charge of others or of a task.Concise Oxford Dictionary, Tenth Edition on CD ROM 2001 Version 1.1, from the Oxford University Press, Great Clarendon Street, Oxford OX2 2DP, UK cites: 1 chiefly historical a man who has people working for him, especially servants or slaves. √ò dated a male head of a household. √ò the male owner of a dog, cat, etc. 3 a person who has complete control of something: he was master of the situation. 4 a man in charge of an organization or group. √ò chiefly Brit. a male schoolteacher, especially at a public or prep school. √ò the head of a college or school. ... In many ways in East Africa the combined phrase \\"Jambo Bwana!\\" (Hello, Master!) became viewed as \\"Hello, Slave Driver\\" or \\"Hello, Slave Master\\" by those seeking independence especially in Colonial East Africa.Maloba, Wunyabari O. (1993) Mau Mau and Kenya: An Analysis of Peasant Revolt, Indiana University Press, 0852557450.Evelyne Jone Rich, Immanuel Maurice Wallerstein , Africa: Tradition and Change (1971) Post Colonial use After independence and over a half century of Independence, many still use the word \\"Jambo!\\" And some enterprising East Africans use the old imperialist welcoming phrase \\"Jambo Bwana!\\" as a welcome greeting seeking tourist dollars. \\"Jambo Bwana!\\" (translated as \\"Hello Mister!\\"), is also notably one of the best internationally known Kenyan hotel pop songs. That welcoming song, with some local variations including the informal name of the \\"Jambo! Jambo!\\", is sometimes used to greet visitors to Kenya.Jambo song in Sawhili from YouTube. Today, more traditional greeting or welcoming terms are encouraged for tourists to better understand and to relate to the local people. For example: In Tanzania and for the Swahili language, there are many tourist guides and educational pages which provide common phrases. Below are four basic ways in Swahili to say \\"Hello!\\" and a basic polite reply after the dash. 1\\\\. Hujambo - more correct than Jambo! (how are you?) ‚Äì Sijambo (seeJAmbo) (I am fine / no worries) 2\\\\. Habari? (any news?) ‚Äì nzuri (nZOOree) (fine) 3\\\\. U hali gani? (oo HAlee GAnee) (how are you) ‚Äì njema (fine) 4\\\\. Shikamoo (a young person to an elder) ‚Äì marahaba Surname use \\"Jambo\\" is also a surname in southern Africa. An example is Zhaimu Jambo, a retired Zimbabwean football player.

It is a member of the Canadian Translators, Terminologists and Interpreters Council (CTTIC), and was founded with the aim of fostering and promoting the translation and interpreting industry within Saskatchewan. Members of the association are professional translators and/or professional interpreters, and have either passed an admission exam attesting to their translating and/or interpreting skills or have transferred their membership from another CTTIC affiliate. ATIS members work in many languages, including: French, Spanish, Chinese, Cree, Japanese and American Sign Language, and are bound by a professional code of ethics. Membership There are five different categories of members within ATIS: founding members, affiliate members, retired members, associate members and certified members. Founding members are those who contributed to the creation of the society in 1979-1980 and are members of good standing in one of the other categories. Affiliate members are those who practice the profession of visual language interpreting and are members of the Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada (AVLIC). Retired members are those who were formally active members of the association and who would like to stay in touch with the ATIS community. Associate members are those who have passed the ATIS admission exam, which includes both a language proficiency exam and a translation exam. Certified members are those who have passed the CTTIC national certification exam or who have had a sample of their work successfully evaluated by ATIS. In 2012, ATIS had 65 members. All categories of members are expected to abide by the ATIS Code of Ethics. Governance ATIS is governed by a board of directors that is currently composed of seven members: Elisabet R√†flos-Sagu√©s, President; Cristina Torres de la Hoz, Vice-President; Robert Clark, Secretary; Gis√®le Pich√©, Treasurer; Julie Pednault, Director of Public Relations; Shannon Bachorick, Exam Coordinator; and Tatiana Zotova, Member at Large. The ATIS Board of Directors is elected by the membership at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). There are also a set of bylaws that assist in governing the organization. Professional development ATIS holds two half-day workshops each year, one during the spring AGM and one during the fall meeting. These workshops focus on a range of issues that are of interest to translators and interpreters who work in a number of language pairs. In spring of 2015, the half-day conference focused on computer assisted translation (CAT). The goal of these workshops is to promote the continued development of qualified translators and interpreters. Sometimes, ATIS also offers reduced registration fees to its members so that they may attend continued education courses through organizations such as the Institut Fran√ßais at the University of Regina. ATIS is also looking into bringing web-based learning to its members.

It tells the story of the orphan Allan who falls in love with his protectress, Mme de Scudemot, who has become indifferent due to erotic excesses in her youth; Allan eventually marries his lover's daughter Camille, but has been smitten by the older woman's indifference. The book is divided into two parts, where the first focuses on Allan and Mme de Scudemot and the second on Allan and Camille. The narrative uses techniques from the Gothic novel and its French counterpart, the \\"roman fr√©n√©tique\\". The novel was written between 1833 and 1836, originally under the title Germaine ou La Piti√©. It was the first full-length novel to be written by Barbey d'Aurevilly, although for a long time it was left unpublished. It was revised and published in 1884. An English translation was published in 1902, falsely attributed to Oscar Wilde under his pseudonym Sebastian Melmoth. Reception In his 1967 monograph The Novels and Stories of Barbey D'Aurevilly, Brian G.

French Indochina in the 1940s was divided into five protectorates: Cambodia, Laos, Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina. The latter three made up Vietnam. In 1940, the French controlled 23 million Vietnamese with 12,000 French soldiers, about 40,000 Vietnamese soldiers, and the S√ªret√©, a powerful police force. At that time, the U.S. had little interest in Vietnam or French Indochina as a whole. Fewer than 100 Americans, mostly missionaries, lived in Vietnam and U.S. government representation consisted of one consul resident in Saigon.Logevall, Fredrik (2012), Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam, New York: Random House, p.32, 72 The years 1940 to 1946 saw the rise of the communist-led Vi·ªát Minh insurgents whose objective was independence from France. The Vi·ªát Minh was most prominent in northern Vietnam (Tonkin) with a plethora of other, semi-allied insurgent groups developing in central (Annam) and southern (Cochinchina) Vietnam. During World War II (1939‚Äì1945), Japan stationed a large number of soldiers in Vietnam and reduced French influence. The Vi·ªát Minh also contested the growing Japanese influence. Late in WW II the United States gave limited assistance to the Vi·ªát Minh to assist it in its struggle against the Japanese. After World War II, France attempted to regain its colonial domination of Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) which led in 1946 to the outbreak of an insurgency against France by the Vi·ªát Minh. The U.S., which initially favored Vietnamese independence, came to support France due to Cold War politics and American fears that an independent Vietnam would be dominated by communists. Until 1949, the French divided Vietnam into three parts: Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China. The most important events occurring in the 1940‚Äì1946 period were: (1) The creation of the Vi·ªát Minh by Ho Chi Minh and other communist leaders in 1941; (2) The Japanese takeover of the government of Vietnam from France in March 1945; (3) The partition of Indochina into two occupation zones to be pacified by the British in the south and China in the north as decided at the Potsdam Conference in July 1945; and (4) The August Revolution in August and September 1945 in which Ho Chi Minh declared independence from France; (5) The beginning of the First Indochina War, usually dated in December 1946, although preceded by many clashes, as France attempted to regain full control of Indochina.Tonnesson, Stein (1985), \\"The Longest Wars: Indochina 1945‚Äì1975\\", Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 22, No. 1, p. 10. Downloaded from JSTOR. This timeline is continued in 1947‚Äì50 in the Vietnam War and subsequent articles. The article titled First Indochina War describes in more detail the struggle for independence from France led by the Vi·ªát Minh. 1940 ; 22 September The French government agreed to allow Japan to station soldiers in Tonkin after clashes between French and Japanese soldiers. During World War II Japan would station a large number of soldiers and sailors in Vietnam although the French administrative structure was allowed to continue to function.Bowman, John S. (1985), The World Almanac of the Vietnam War, New York: Pharos Books, p. 14 ; 23 December The rising power of Japan in Vietnam encouraged nationalist groups to revolt from French rule in Bac Son near the Chinese border and in Cochin China. The American Consul in Saigon reported that \\"thousands of natives have been killed and more are in prison awaiting execution.\\" He described \\"promiscuous machine-gunning\\" of Vietnamese civilians\\" by French soldiers.Spector, Ronald H. (1983), Advice and Support: The Early Years, 1941‚Äì1960, Washington, D.C.: Superintendent of Documents, p. 18 1941 ; 10 May The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, chaired by Ho Chi Minh (then known as Nguyen Ai Quoc), held its 8th Plenum in the Vietnamese village of Pac Bo in Cao B·∫±ng province, near the border of Vietnam with China. This was the first time that Ho had set foot in Vietnam since 1911 after living in England, France, the United States, the USSR, and China. The Central Committee created the Vi·ªát Minh as a broad-based, nationalist organization to struggle for independence from France and Japan. \\"By founding the Vi·ªát Minh, Ho Chi Minh brought together...the dynamism of nationalism and that of international communism.Logevall, pp. 34‚Äì36 As a temporary measure, the Central Committee emphasized patriotism and nationalism more than communist objectives. The resolution of the Central Committee toned down its previous support for seizing the land of landlords to redistribute it to peasants, instead promoting reductions of rent for land and land seizures only from French colonialists and Vietnamese \\"traitors.\\"Duiker, William J. (1996), The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam, Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, p. 721-73 The Central Committee also concluded that the independence of Vietnam would be won only by armed rebellion which linked urban nationalism with rural rebellion. Armed forces were to be created in all areas of the country in which the Communist Party was active. V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p would become the primary leader of the armed forces.Duiker, pp. 73‚Äì75 ; 14 July Japan demanded and received approval from the Vichy French government to establish military bases in southern Vietnam in addition to bases in northern Vietnam.Logevall, p. 39 ; 25 July News that Japanese warships and troopships were near Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam caused the U.S. to freeze Japanese assets, impose an embargo, and terminate the export of petroleum to Japan. For Japan the potential economic consequences of the U.S. actions were dire. The U.S. \\"now preferred to risk war rather than allow Japan to become more powerful.\\"Logevall, pp 41‚Äì42 ; 8 December The United States declared war on Japan after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and launched invasions throughout Southeast Asia. Japan already had garrisoned 50,000 troops in Vietnam with the consent of the Vichy French government.Spector, p. 18 1943 ; April U.S. Navy Commodore Milton E. Miles, stationed in Chungking, China proposed that twenty Office of Strategic Services (OSS) agents be parachuted into the Central Highlands of Vietnam to organize guerrilla bands among the highland peoples to oppose the Japanese forces. The plan was approved, but never implemented. The United States, however, established a network of Vietnamese and French colonials for intelligence and espionage.Spector, pp. 26‚Äì27 1944 ; 24 January President Roosevelt of the United States wrote that \\"Indo-China should not go back to France...France has had the country...one hundred years, and the people are worse off than they were at the beginning.\\" Roosevelt envisioned a post-World War II trusteeship for Indochina.Spector, p. 22, Tonnesson (1985), p. 11 ; 8 July The French S√ªret√© discovered a Vi·ªát Minh base in Cao B·∫±ng Province with arms and other material and warned of an immediate need \\"to re-establish authority.\\" The Vi·ªát Minh at this time controlled much of the border areas on northern Vietnam in Cao B·∫±ng, B·∫Øc K·∫°n, and L·∫°ng S∆°n provinces. ; 27 December U.S. General Albert C. Wedemeyer in Chungking reported that Ambassador Patrick J. Hurley was displeased with aid given to intelligence operatives in Vietnam. Hurley \\"had increasing evidence that the British, French, and Dutch are working...for the attainment of imperialistic policies and he felt we should do nothing to assist them in their endeavors which run counter to U.S. policy.\\" Hurley was reflecting President Roosevelt's position.Spector, p. 28 ; 31 December The Vi·ªát Minh claimed to have 500,000 members of whom 200,000 were in Tonkin, 150,000 in Annam, and 100,000 in Cochinchina. The Vi·ªát Minh military and political structure was strongest and best organized in Tonkin.\\"Pentagon Papers, \\"Vietnam and the U.S., 1940‚Äì1950\\", p.

The British were conducting clandestine operations in Indochina without informing the United States.Spector, p. 47 ; February A famine began in northern Vietnam which would result in about one million people dying‚Äîapproximately 10 percent of the population of Tonkin and Annam‚Äîwithin a few months. Vietnamese blamed France and Japan for the disaster. The Vi·ªát Minh were credited with seizing stocks of rice and distributing it to the poor to ameliorate the famine.Logevall, p. 81 ; 20 February President Roosevelt at the Yalta Conference said he was \\"in favor of anything that is against the Japanese in Indochina provided that we do not align ourselves with the French.\\"Spector, p. 30 ; 7 March U.S. General Claire Lee Chennault in Chungking said that \\"any help or aid given by us [to Vietnam] shall be in such a way that it cannot possibly be construed as furthering the political aims of the French.\\"Spector, p. 30 ; 9 March Japan demanded that the French colonial government of Vietnam be placed under its control, including the banks and French and Vietnamese armed forces. When the French did not immediately accede to their demands the Japanese seized the government by force, defeating the French in several battles. The reason for the Japanese action was a fear that the United States would invade Vietnam. Japan was fortifying its defenses and eliminating the remaining French influence in the country. Japan persuaded the former emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i to declare Vietnam independent of France and set up a puppet government headed by Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim.Logevall, pp. 67‚Äì72 ; 10 March U.S. General Robert B. McClure in China authorized air support to the French resisting Japanese control of Indochina. However, President Roosevelt in Washington said that he wanted \\"to discontinue colonialization\\" in Southeast Asia and did not wish that any military assistance be given to the French in Indochina.Spector, pp. 31‚Äì32 ; 14 March French Leader Charles de Gaulle in Paris criticized the United States and its allies for not helping the French in Indochina. De Gaulle affirmed that France would regain control of Indochina.Logevall p 73 ; 17 March Ho Chi Minh and Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng met with American Captain Charles Fenn who worked for the Office of Strategic Services in Kunming, China. Three days later the OSS agreed to provide radio equipment, arms, and ammunition to the Vi·ªát Minh. Ho agreed to gather intelligence, rescue downed American pilots, and sabotage Japanese installations. Fenn was favorably impressed with Ho.Logevall, pp 82‚Äì84 ; 18 March Yielding to pressure from the French and his advisers, President Roosevelt authorized American aid to the French in Indochina. The French would charge that U.S. aid was limited and late.Spector, pp. 33‚Äì34 Historians disagree about whether or not Roosevelt's action was a change in his policy of opposing a French return to power in Indochina.See \\"Tonnesson, Stein, \\"Franklin Roosevelt, Trusteeship, and Indochina: A Reassessment\\" in The First Vietnam War (2007, Eds. Mark Atwood Lawrence and Fredrik Logevall, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 56‚Äì73 ; 24 March France issued a declaration, which assumed that France would regain control of Vietnam, announcing the formation of an Indochinese Federation in which France would extend additional rights to Indochinese, but retain control of defense and foreign affairs. Vietnamese nationalists of all political persuasions condemned the declaration, especially the continued division of Vietnam into three parts: Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina.Logevall, pp. 75‚Äì76 ; 29 March Ho Chi Minh met with U.S. General Chennault in Kunming, China. Chennault thanked Ho for rescuing downed American pilots. Ho requested and received an autographed photograph of Chennault which he used to demonstrate the support he had from the United States.Logevall, p. 84 ; 7 April The United States Department of War authorized General Wedemeyer in China to support French forces in Vietnam \\"providing they represent only a negligible diversion\\" from U.S. priorities. Wedemeyer was hard pressed for resources and dropped mostly medicine to the French.Spector, p. 34 ; 12 April U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt died. Harry S. Truman became President. ; 13 April U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Robert A. Lovett said that former President Roosevelt's prohibition on a definite U.S. policy regarding Indochina was a \\"serious embarrassment to the military.\\" Lovett's statement initiated a debate among Washington government agencies.Spector, p. 44 ; 16 April A policy paper given new U.S. President Truman by the European office of the Department of State advocated a pro- French policy in Indochina. Southeast Asian specialists at the State Department complained later that the policy paper deliberately excluded information about President Roosevelt's opposition to the French in Indochina.Tonnessson (2007), p.68-69 ; 30 April The United States Department of State approved a policy paper stating that the U.S. would not oppose restoration of French sovereignty in Indochina, but would seek to ensure that the French permitted the Indochinese peoples more autonomy. This new policy was a large step away from Roosevelt's previous opposition to the French, but, except for Asian experts in the State Department, there was little support in the U.S. government for continuing to follow Roosevelt's policy.Spector, p 44 ; 28 May U.S.General Wedemeyer in China complained of a \\"British and French plan to reestablish their pre-war political and economic positions in Southeast Asia\\" and said they were using American supplies to \\"invade Indochina...and re-establish French imperialism. In the response from Washington, Wedemeyer was informed that the U.S. now \\"welcomes French participation in the Pacific War.\\"Spector, p. 49 ; 2 June The U.S. Secretary of State sent a report to President Truman stating that \\"the United States recognizes French sovereignty over Indochina.\\" Thus, the U.S. had reversed Roosevelt's opposition to supporting the French in their efforts to regain control of Indochina.Spector, p. 45 ; 16 July Three U.S. soldiers from the OSS led by Major Allison Thomas parachuted into the Vi·ªát Minh's base camp in northern Viet Nam. They were cordially greeted. Thomas said \\"Vi·ªát Minh league is not Communist. Stands for freedom and reforms against French harshness.\\"Logevall, p. 85 The objective of the Americans was to organize a guerrilla group to attack a Japanese railroad. Ho Chi Minh introduced himself to them as Mr. Hoo.\\"Ho Chi Minh and the OSS\\", History Net, http://www.historynet.com/ho-chi-minh-and-the-oss.htm, accessed 29 Oct 2015 ; 26 July The Potsdam Conference of victorious allies decided that the British would accept the surrender of Japanese troops in Indochina south of the 16th parallel and China would accept their surrender north of the 16th parallel. ; 17 August The August Revolution broke out. The National Congress of the Vi·ªát Minh declared a general uprising to take political power in Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh was elected to preside over the National Liberation Committee. The call for the general uprising was prompted by the news that Japan would surrender.Duiker, p. 92, 96 ; 19 August The Vi·ªát Minh organized a very large demonstration in Hanoi and took charge of the government in the city and much of northern Vietnam.Duiker, p. 98 ; 22 August American intelligence officer Major Archimedes L. Patti arrived in Hanoi to secure the release of American POWs held by the Japanese in Indochina. Accompanying Patti was a French team headed by Jean Sainteny, ostensibly in Indochina to care for French POWs. Ho Chi Minh warned Patti that Sainteny's real objective was to reassert French control over Vietnam.Logevall, p. 100 Patti reported to his superiors in China that \\"Vi·ªát Minh strong and belligerent and definitely anti-French. Suggest no more French be permitted to enter French Indo-China and especially not armed.\\" Patti refused to allow the release of 4,500 French soldiers imprisoned in Hanoi by the Japanese.Spector, p. 57-59 ; 26 August Ho Chi Minh entered the city of Hanoi. The Vi·ªát Minh military force that had taken control of Hanoi consisted of about 200 men. The Vi·ªát Minh army numbered about 1,200 trained men and hundreds of thousands of militia, men and women, most of them without firearms.Logevall, p. 93; Marr, David G. (2007), \\"Creating Defense Capacity in Vietnam, 1945‚Äì1947\\", in The First Vietnam War, Mark Atwood Lawrence and Frederik Logevall, eds., Cambridge: Harvard University Press, p. 76 ; 2 September Japan signed the instrument of surrender in Tokyo Bay ending World War II. In Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh declared independence from France, the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the formation of his government. In his speech Ho referred to the U.S. Declaration of Independence and appealed to the victorious allies of World War II \\"to oppose the wicked schemes of the French imperialists, and...to recognize our freedom and independence.\\"Logevall, pp. 97‚Äì98 In Saigon and southern Vietnam, there was political disorder with competition, often violent, among religious sects and political factions. The Vi·ªát Minh organized a large demonstration which resulted in attacks on French residents of the city. A recently arrived team of American OSS personnel enlisted Japanese soldiers to protect French citizens.Spector, p. 66 ; 9 September The main force of a 150,000 man Chinese army arrived in Hanoi to accept the surrender of Japanese forces and preserve law and order north of the 16th parallel of Vietnam. Many accounts described the Chinese soldiers as like \\"a swarm of locusts.\\" Ho Chi Minh initially cooperated with the Chinese who unceremoniously evicted the French from the Governor-General's Palace.Logevall, pp. 109‚Äì110 American advisers accompanied the Chinese but were ordered \\"not be become involved...in French-Chinese relations or in any way become associated with either side in possible conflicts.\\"Springhall, John (Jan 2005), \\"'Kicking out the Vietnminh': How Britain Allowed France to Reoccupy South Indochina, 1945‚Äì46, Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 40, No. 2, p. 119.

Historian Frederick Logevall has suggested this as the start date for the Vi·ªát Minh war against the French.Logevall, p. 115 ; 24 September In Saigon, the Vi·ªát Minh declared a general strike and they and other nationalist groups attacked French, British, and Japanese, and European civilians. About 20,000 French citizens lived in Saigon. Over the next several days, 150‚Äì300 French and Eurasian civilians and about 200 Vietnamese were killed.Pentagon Papers, p. B-38; Logevall, p 115; Springhall, p. 123 ; 26 September Lt. Colonel A. Peter Dewey, son of U.S. presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, was killed, apparently by mistake, by Vi·ªát Minh soldiers in Saigon ‚Äì the first American to die in Vietnam. Dewey was in Saigon to arrange for the repatriation of American prisoners of war captured by the Japanese. Dewey had complained about abuses of power by British and French soldiers in Saigon and had been prohibited by British commander Douglas Gracey from flying a U.S. flag on his vehicle. The Vi·ªát Minh apparently thought that he was French. Dewey's appraisal of the situation was that \\"Cochinchina is burning, the French and the British are finished here, and we [the United States] ought to clear out of Southeast Asia.\\"Logevall, p. 117 French general Marcel Alessandri, visiting Hanoi, asked help of U.S. General Gallagher in persuading the Chinese military forces to release all French prisoners, rearm the French police and military, and return control of the radio station and public utilities to the French. The Chinese commander agreed only to release French prisoners.Spector, p. 64 ; 27 September In a meeting with U.S. Army officers General Gallagher and Major Patti, Ho Chi Minh \\"expressed the fear that the Allies considered Indochina a conquered country and that the Chinese came as conquerors.\\" Gallager and Patti attempted to reassure him and urged continued negotiations with the French.Spector, p. 64 ; 4 October U.S. General Gallagher in Hanoi reported a \\"noticeable change in the attitude of the Annamites [Vietnamese] here...since that became aware of the fact that we were not going to interfere and would probably help the French.Spector, p. 64 ; 5 October French general Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque arrived in Saigon as head of a regiment of French soldiers. He and General Gracey and a large number of Japanese troops pushed the Vi·ªát Minh out of Saigon and captured nearby areas. More than 1,000 Japanese soldiers deserted rather than fight with the British and French and fought on the side of the Vi·ªát Minh. By early November, the British and Japanese fighting the Vi·ªát Minh had suffered 19 and 54 soldiers killed respectively.Logevall, pp. 117‚Äì118 ; 9 October The British and French governments concluded an agreement in London in which the British recognized France as the \\"sole legitimate authority\\" south of the 16th parallel. The United Kingdom agreed to help transport French troops to southern Vietnam to reinforce General Leclerq. In the meantime, the agreement specified \\"close and friendly cooperation between the French and British commanders.\\"Pentagon Papers, p. B-39 The ships used to transport French soldiers included eight U.S. flag vessels, the first significant American aid to the French in Vietnam.Logevall, pp. 118‚Äì119 ; 25 October French General Leclerq with 35,000 French, British, and Japanese soldiers launched an offensive against the nationalist forces, including the Vi·ªát Minh, who controlled much of the countryside of southern Vietnam. By the middle of December, Leclerq had gained control of most towns and cities south of the 16th parallel. The Vi·ªát Minh and others began a guerrilla campaign against the French. A journalist said, \\"What was needed was not 35,000 men...but 100,000 and Cochinchina was not the only problem.\\"Pentagon Papers pp. B-39-40; Logevall, p. 119 ; 31 October Former Catholic monk and supporter of French leader Charles de Gaulle, Thierry d'Argenlieu arrived in Saigon as High Commissioner for Indochina. Described by one wag as having \\"the most brilliant mind of the twelfth century\\", D'Argenliu shared De Gaulle's belief that the French empire, including Indochina, should be retained intact.Logevall, pp. 124‚Äì125 ; 11 November At a meeting in Hanoi the Indochina Communist Party dissolved itself, citing a need to foster national unity in search of independence from France as the reason. Communist domination of the Vi·ªát Minh had been criticized by other nationalist groups and Ho Chi Minh had apparently decided that unity was more important for the moment than communist ideology.Pentagon Papers, pp B-42-43 ; 1 December Ho Chi Minh began negotiations in Hanoi with French Commissioner for Tonkin, Jean Sainteny. Ho's concern was that the 150,000 Chinese troops in northern Vietnam would not go home and that they were aiding the Vi·ªát Minh's rival nationalist groups, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party and the Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam. Ho had decided to seek cooperation with the French even thought that might delay Vietnam attaining independence from France.Logevall, p. 128 ; 12 December U.S. General Gallagher departed Hanoi and shut down the U.S. advisory mission in northern Vietnam. The U.S. was blamed by the French for colluding with the Vi·ªát Minh and by the Vi·ªát Minh for facilitating the resumption of French control over IndochinaSpector, pp 72 ; 31 December The French estimated that the Vi·ªát Minh army in northern Vietnam, mostly Tonkin, numbered 28,000 men.Marr, p. 101 1946 ; 1 January After negotiations with other nationalist groups, a new government in Hanoi was set up with Ho Chi Minh as President and Nguyen Hai Than as Vice President. Elections were to follow to elect a national assembly with some seats guaranteed to two nationalist organizations. Earlier, Ho had abolished the communist party of Vietnam to emphasize his nationalist credentials.Duiker, pp. 116‚Äì117 ; 6 January In an election for the National Assembly in northern Vietnam, the Vi·ªát Minh and allied nationalist groups won 300 of 350 seats. Most observers believed the elections were fair, although there were a few charges that voters had been intimidated.Duiker, p. 122 ; 5 February French General Leclerq declared that, as a result of his military campaigns against nationalist groups, \\"the pacification of Cochinchina [southern Vietnam] is entirely achieved.\\"Marr, p. 77 Author Bernard Fall later commented that Leclerq gained control of Cochin China but only \\"to the extent of 100 yards on either side of all major roads.\\"Logevall, p. 131 ; 20 February Despite his apparent success pacifying Cochinchina General Leclerq appealed to France to grant concessions to the Vi·ªát Minh. At this time Ho Chi Minh was engaged in negotiations with French representative Sainteny in Hanoi. De Gaulle and d'Argenlieu opposed any concessions toward independence for Vietnam.Logevall, pp. 131‚Äì132 ; 27 February Twenty-one thousand French soldiers boarded ships in Saigon for Tonkin with the goal of reoccupying northern Vietnam, putting pressure on Ho Chi Minh to come to terms in his negotiations with France about the future of Vietnam, and gaining the release of 3,000 French soldiers still held prisoner in Hanoi.Logevall, pp. 132‚Äì133 ; 28 February France completed an agreement with the Chinese government for the withdrawal of Chinese soldiers from Vietnam north of the 16th parallel.Pentagon Papers, B-47 Vi·ªát Minh leader Ho Chi Minh sent a telegram to U.S. President Truman appealing to the U.S. \\"to interfere urgently in support of our [Vietnamase] independence.\\" This was one of several letters and telegrams that Ho sent to the United States appealing for support. The U.S. never answered him.National Archives, https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=228;, Logevall, p. 104 ; 4 March The British completed their withdrawal from Vietnam south of the 16th parallel, leaving French forces in control of the government of Cochinchina.Pentagon Papers, B-47 ; 6 March In the morning, the French armada of 35 ships and 21,000 men attempted to land at Haiphong in Tonkin. Their landing was prevented by Chinese soldiers occupying the harbor who exchanged fire with the French ships. The Chinese pressured both the French and the Vietnamese to sign an agreement. In the afternoon, Ho Chi Minh and Sainteny concluded a provisional agreement. France recognized the \\"Republic of Vietnam\\" as a \\"free state\\" within the French Union. The Vietnamese agreed to the stationing of 25,000 French troops for five years in Tonkin to replace the departing Chinese. France agreed to allow an election to decide whether the three regions of Vietnam would be united. Ho Chi Minh was severely criticized by other nationalists for the agreement, which offered Vietnam less than independence and that only on a provisional basis. He reportedly said that \\"I prefer to sniff French shit for five years than eat Chinese shit for the rest of my life.\\"Logevall, p. 133 ; 10 April Insurgent leader Nguy·ªÖn B√¨nh in Cochinchina announced the creation of a National United Front to unite nationalist groups to fight the French and gain independence. In June, Nguyen would join the Communist party but would retain some independence from the Vi·ªát Minh in northern Vietnam.Logevall, p. 153 ; 31 May Ho Chi Minh left Vietnam for negotiations concerning Vietnamese independence in Paris. He was warmly received in France.Logevall, pp 137‚Äì139 ; 1 June French High Commissioner for Indochina Thierry d'Argenlieu in Saigon said that the 6 March agreement between the Vi·ªát Minh and the French did not apply to Cochinchina and announced the formation of the Republic of Cochin China for southern Vietnam.Spector, p. 79 ; 8 June General Leclerc (who had departed Vietnam) wrote a letter to the French ruling party stating that the war in Vietnam was practically won and that France should not concede much to the Vietnamese negotiators in Paris. Leclerq said \\"it would be very dangerous for the French representatives at the negotiations to let themselves be fooled by the deceptive language (democracy, resistance, the new France) that Ho Chi Minh and his team utilize to perfection.\\"Logevall, pp. 149‚Äì150 ; 15 June The last Chinese soldiers departed northern Vietnam. The Chinese army apparently delayed its departure in order to extract as much wealth as possible from their occupation.Pentagon Papers, p. B-47 ; 21 June Illustrating the paucity of military capability among the Vi·ªát Minh and other nationalist groups resisting the French, a commander named Nguyen Son in the Central Highlands had about 12,000 fighters under his command, but one of his brigades had only 1,500 rifles for 4,000 men. Nevertheless, Nguyen was able to turn back a French offensive aiming to capture the coastal city of Qui Nh∆°n.Marr, p. 94 ; 9 August The U.S. vice-consul in Hanoi, James L. O'Sullivan, reported \\"an imminent danger of an open break between the French and Viet Nam\\", and said \\"that, although the French could quickly overrun the country, they could not...pacify it except through a long and bitter military operation.\\"Spector, p. 79 ; 31 August A report by the French authorities in southern Vietnam (Cochinchina) was much more pessimistic than earlier reports. Insurgent groups, earlier reported as destroyed, had reconstituted themselves and the Vi·ªát Minh was gaining strength by accepting \\"semi-complicity\\" by the population, e.g. cooperating openly with the French and secretly with the Vi·ªát Minh.Marr, p. 96 ; 14 September In Paris, Ho Chi Minh achieved a modus vivendi in negotiations with France by which a ceasefire in southern Vietnam was to come into effect on 30 October. France, however, did not promise independence for Vietnam. The fact that the ceasefire proved to be effective was a measure of the control the Vi·ªát Minh had over nationalist groups in southern Vietnam even though its power base was in the north.Tonnesson (1985), p. 13 ; 20 October Ho Chi Minh arrived in Haiphong after an absence of more than 4 months. He had been negotiating, with little success, for Vietnamese independence with the French government in Paris.Tonnesson, Stein (2009), Vietnam 1946: How the War Began, Berkeley: University of California Press, p 89 In his absence, Vi·ªát Minh military leader V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p had prepared for war with the French. With the departure of the Chinese army in June, Giap had crushed the pro-Chinese nationalist groups in northern Vietnam, killing hundreds or thousands of their followers and, despite a cease fire, engaged the French when they attempted to expand their control out of the cities to the countryside. The Vi·ªát Minh, said historian Frederik Logevall, \\"previously had genuine legitimacy in calling themselves a broad-based nationalist front\\" but were now \\"synonymous with the Communist movement.\\"Logevall, p. 151 ; 31 October The French estimated that Vi·ªát Minh fighters in northern Vietnam (mostly Tonkin) numbered 40,000 to 45,000, an increase from an estimated 28,000 at the end of 1945. In southern Vietnam, there were probably only about 5,000 Vi·ªát Minh fighters of unquestioned loyalty, although many other nationalistic insurgent groups existed. The French had 75,000 soldiers in Vietnam, more than one-half in the north.Marr, p. 101 ; 8 November The Vi·ªát Minh in Hanoi demanded that the three regions of Vietnam‚ÄîTonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina‚Äîbe united into one.Spector, p. 81 ; 10 November The anti-communist leader of the French-backed government of Cochinchina, Dr. Nguyen Van Thinh, committed suicide.Logevall, p. 154 ; 20 November Fighting broke out in Haiphong between the French and the Vi·ªát Minh. A cease fire was arranged.Spector, p. 81 ; 22 November The French commander in Tonkin was ordered \\"to teach a hard lesson to those [the Vi·ªát Minh] who have so treacherously attacked us. By every possible means you must take complete control of Haiphong and force the Vietnamese government and army into submission.\\"Logevall, p. 157 ; 23 November After giving the Vi·ªát Minh an ultimatum to withdraw from Haiphong, the French under General Jean √âtienne Valluy began a naval and aerial bombardment of the city that endured 2 days and destroyed much of the Vietnamese and Chinese quarters of the city. An estimated 6,000 civilians were killed. French Commissioner General d'Argenlieu in Paris informed Valluy that he approved of the bombardment.Logevall, pp. 157‚Äì158; Spector, p. 81; Tonnesson (1985), p. 13 ; 5 December As American diplomat Abbot Low Moffat prepared to meet with Ho Chi Minh in Hanoi, Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson instructed him to \\"keep in mind Ho's clear record as [an] agent of international communism.\\" Acheson said that the worst outcome of the French/Vi·ªát Minh struggle in Vietnam would be a \\"Communist- dominated, Moscow-oriented state.\\" The policy struggle in the Department of State about Vietnam between the Europeanists, represented by Acheson, and the Asian hands had been won by the Europeanists whose priority was maintaining a friendly French government in power in France to further American aims in Europe.Spector, p. 83-84 ; 9 December American diplomat Moffat reported to the Department of State about his visit to Hanoi. Moffat had met with Ho Chi Minh. His brief was to assure Ho of U.S. support of \\"autonomy\\" for Vietnam but to warn Ho not to use force to achieve his objective. Ho asked for U.S. assistance and offered a naval base to the U.S. at Cam Ranh Bay. Moffat reported to Washington that the Vi·ªát Minh communists were in control of the Vietnamese government and that a French presence in Vietnam was required to prevent an expansion of Soviet and possible Chinese communist influence. However, Moffat also expressed sympathy with the nationalist aspirations of the Vi·ªát Minh and said that France had no viable option other than compromise.Logevall, pp 158‚Äì159 ; 17 December The U.S. Department of State in Washington informed its personnel worldwide that the Vi·ªát Minh were communists and that the French presence in Vietnam was imperative \\"as an antidote to Soviet influence [and] future Chinese imperialism. Thus, Vietnam was identified by the United States as a participant in the intensifying Cold War tension between the Soviet Union and the United States. In the opinion of some authorities, this was a moment in which the U.S. might have averted the First Indochina War (and the later Vietnam War) had the U.S. told France bluntly to observe the 6 March agreement which recognized the Vi·ªát Minh as a legitimate government authority.Logevall, pp 158‚Äì160 Socialist L√©on Blum became premier of France. A few days earlier, Blum had stated that \\"We must reach agreement [with the Vi·ªát Minh] on the basis of independence [for Vietnam]\\". Blum's assumption of power came too late to decelerate the movement toward outright war between the French and the Vi·ªát Minh. France feared that any concessions to the Vi·ªát Minh would inspire rebellion in France's African colonies plus the takeover by the Vi·ªát Minh of all French assets in Indochina.Logevall, p. 160; Tonnesson (1985), p. 16 French and Vi·ªát Minh forces clashed in Hanoi with casualties on both sides as the French advanced to take control of the city.Logevall, p. 162 French leader Charles de Gaulle met with French High Commissioner for Indochina Thierry d'Argenlieu in France and expressed support for the Commissioner's uncompromising stance against independence for Vietnam.Logevall, p. 165 ; 19 December The Vi·ªát Minh launched their first ever large-scale attack against the French. The Vi·ªát Minh military leader, V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p, had three divisions of soldiers stationed near Hanoi and used his few pieces of artillery to blast away at the French. French negotiator Jean Sainteny was seriously wounded when a land mine blew up his car. It would take the French two months to expel the Vi·ªát Minh from Hanoi as combat spread to all parts of Vietnam. This date and the Vi·ªát Minh attack‚Äîactually a counter- attack‚Äîis often considered by pro-French historians the beginning of the First Indochina War.Logevall, p. 161-164 ; 21 December Ho Chi Minh broadcast by radio a nationwide appeal to Vietnamese to rise up in resistance to French rule.Spector, p. 83 ; 23 December The Communist Party of France voted in favor of a message supporting French troops in Vietnam. The communists were attempting to maintain a place in the Cabinet of Ministers and in mainstream politics of France and had little interest in supporting the Vi·ªát Minh in Vietnam.Tonnesson (1985), p. 17 ; 24 December U.S. State Department Asian expert John Carter Vincent wrote that the French lacked the military strength to gain control of Vietnam, lacked public support in France for the war, and had a weak and divided government. He predicted that guerrilla war would continue indefinitely.Spector, p. 83 ; 31 December The Vi·ªát Minh army numbered about 60,000 of whom 40,000 had rifles. Another 40,000 were in militia and para-military organizations.Asprey, Robert B.

It also commissions and co-produces new works, often in collaboration with international festivals, arts organisations, funders and other partners. Founded in 1994, Sonic Acts organises the biennial Sonic Acts Festival in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Over the years, it has established itself as a thematic festival with a strong focus on contemporary and historical developments at the intersections of art, technology, music and science. The festival has invited many well-known artists and musicians such as the Vasulkas, Autechre, Pauline Oliveros, and Florian Hecker, as well as theorists and scientists such as Graham Harman, Saskia Sassen, Tim Morton, Benjamin H. Bratton, Raphael Bousso, and George Dyson. Each festival edition explores the chosen theme by means of an international conference, a wide range of concerts and performances, exhibitions and screenings, and embraces a broad spectrum of fields, practices and disciplines. The 25th anniversary edition of Sonic Acts Festival took place in 2019 at Paradiso (Amsterdam), Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, De Brakke Grond, Muziekgebouw aan het IJ and Arti et Amicitiae. More recently, Sonic Acts organises the biennial Sonic Acts Academy, which alternates each year with the festival. The Academy is a new platform that aims to grow, expand, sustain and disseminate stimulating discourse about artistic research. Its first edition took place in 2016 at various locations in Amsterdam. The most recent edition of Sonic Acts Academy was held from 21 to 23 February 2020.  Sonic Acts Festival  Entrance of Sonic Acts Festival 2015 at Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ Sonic Acts Festival takes place every two years in a variety of locations in and around Amsterdam. From a small festival, it has grown into a platform for the research, development and presentation of cutting-edge art, science, music and technology, with a large well-attended festival for over 20 years. The festival comprises a varying programme of concerts, a multi-day international conference, an extensive film programme, masterclasses, workshops, an exhibition and site-specific work. = Early years (1994‚Äì1998) = Sonic Acts was founded in 1994 by Paradiso and the ArtScience Interfaculty (Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, and Royal Conservatory of The Hague) to provide a stage for new developments in electronic music and interdisciplinary art forms. The festival was initially organised on a yearly basis in Paradiso, a music venue that had become synonymous with counterculture. In the early years of Sonic Acts, increasing attention was given to demonstrations and workshops, as the festival broadened in scope to focus on the theoretical as well as the practical aspects of artistic developments. In 1995, Sonic Acts began to introduce new forms of electronic music, such as IDM and electro, as the festival featured performances by English electronic musician Mike Paradinas and ambient techno duo Plaid, among others. In the following years, the festival continued to present new genres of electronic music that were emerging in the early 1990s, with performances by pioneering acts including Robin Rimbaud and English IDM duo Autechre. = Turn of the century (1999‚Äì2009) = The festival was held in August each year until 1999, when it took place from 20 to 23 December. This year also marked enlargement of the festival, with a four-hour boat trip along the IJ to various indoor and outdoor locations in addition to Paradiso. For the first time the festival had a connecting theme, as participating artists took the music of Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi as a starting point for their work. Since 2001 each edition of the festival has been named after its theme. In the early to mid 2000s, Sonic Acts shifted its focus to digital arts and their historical contexts. Under the name Sonic Light, the ninth edition of Sonic Acts was devoted to the art of composed light: ‚Äúthe shaping in time of light and colour in a way which is comparable to the way sound is shaped into music‚Äù. The festival featured projections by the late German-American filmmaker Oskar Fischinger and Japanese artist Yasunao Tone, as well as Dutch artist Joost Rekveld, who presented a history of abstract animation and light art. Sonic Light also featured renowned and emerging sound artists such as American composer Maryanne Amacher, avant-garde musician Francisco L√≥pez, Japanese composer Ikue Mori and Canadian electronic musician Venetian Snares. In 2004, Sonic Acts held its tenth edition of the festival. Titled Unsorted, the festival explored emerging art forms that were rooted in the information society. Particular attention was paid to artists from the labels Raster-Noton and Touch, as well as the breakcore scene. Performing artists included Carl Michael von Hausswolff, Jon Wozencroft, Philip Jeck, BJ Nilsen, Fennesz, Chris Watson and Sickboy. The following edition, titled The Anthology of Computer Art, was held from 23 to 26 February 2006 in Paradiso and De Balie. The festival focussed on the history of computer art and described itself as ‚Äúa tribute to the work of the early pioneers‚Äù. A DVD and a book exploring the theme were published to coincide with the festival. Between 2006 and 2010, the link between art, science and technology was developed and the symposium grew. In 2008, the twelfth edition of the festival promised a comprehensive overview of the cinematic experience, proposing that ‚Äúrecent technological developments in digitalisation, higher definition imagery and sound, ever-faster communication networks and new types of portable video players make it necessary to re-address the question of what cinema actually is\\". = Recent years (2010‚Äìpresent) = From 2010, Sonic Acts began to fulfil more functions as an organisation and expanded its activities through international collaborations, organising large-scale projects such as the Kontraste festival in Austria and the international research project Dark Ecology. This led to new commissions, workshops, masterclasses and lectures, as well as substantive research and publications, which were incorporated into the festival. Sonic Acts also evolved to explore expansive themes. The title of the 2010 edition of the festival, The Poetics of Space, was derived from the English translation of the book La Po√©tique de l‚ÄôEspace (1958) by the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard,Sonic Acts XIII - The Poetics of Space while the 2012 edition offered ‚Äúan intense experience of time‚Äù under the title Travelling Time. In 2013, Sonic Acts addressed the theme of The Dark Universe, as inspiration was sought from cosmology and physics. Lectures were given by Dutch physicist Gerard ‚Äôt Hooft, sociologist Saskia Sassen and American architect Keller Easterling, among others, and new works were presented by artists such as Matthijs Munnik, Yamila Rios and Joris Strijbos. With 2015‚Äôs The Geologic Imagination, Sonic Acts shifted its focus to planet Earth. The starting point for the festival was the thesis that we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. It featured lectures by American philosopher Graham Harman and design theorist Benjamin H. Bratton, as well as work by artists Raviv Ganchrow and Jananne Al-Ani. The festival attracted nearly 9500 visitors. Sonic Acts Festival 2015 at Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ In 2017, Sonic Acts continued the festival‚Äôs gradual change in perspective, exploring what it means to be human against the backdrop of the Anthropocene and the rapidly changing relationship between humans and machines.Sonic Acts Festival 2017 - The Noise of Being Titled The Noise of Being, the seventeenth edition of the festival was visited by 10,625 people. Participating artists and speakers included Eyal Weizman, JK Flesh, Roly Porter, Kara-Lis Coverdale, Jennifer Walshe, Le1f, Evian Christ and Christina Vantzou. The opening night featured four new Vertical Cinema films by Susan Schuppli, HC Gilje, Lukas Marxt, and BJ Nilsen & Karl Lemieux. The Noise of Being received positive reviews. The Wire Magazine described the festival as ‚Äútriggering the imagination necessary for an urgent debate‚Äù. Crack Magazine wrote that the festival ‚Äúkept its audience shifting, rotating, and reversing around the normalised ideas we all share‚Äù. The latest edition of Sonic Acts Festival was held under the name HEREAFTER in 2019 and focused on the current crisis and challenges confronted on a daily basis as well as the consequences they cause. The festival hosted more than 120 artists and speakers including Beatriz Ferreyra, Timothy Morton, Straub-Huillet, Rosi Braidotti, Sondra Perry and Ulrike Ottinger.  Evolution and growth  Sonic Acts has grown into an organisation that is active throughout the year, producing and presenting work both in the Netherlands and abroad. Recent projects include the three-year art, research & commissioning project Dark Ecology, predominantly taking place in the Arctic region, and its globally touring program Vertical Cinema. Sonic Acts has developed into a hub for an international network of artists, curators and specialists, focusing on future developments as well as the rich histories of art, science and technology.  Sonic Acts Academy  In 2016 Sonic Acts launched Sonic Acts Academy, a new platform that aims to grow, expand, sustain and disseminate stimulating discourse about artistic research. Its first edition took place from 26 to 28 February at various locations in Amsterdam. Sonic Acts Academy is presented as an exploratory event with a symposium, film screenings, concerts, installations, masterclasses and workshops. The most recent edition of Sonic Acts Academy was held from 21 to 23 February 2020 with artists and speakers including Holly Herndon, No Bra, T. J. Demos, and Terike Haapoja.  Projects  = Dark Ecology = Dark Ecology was a three-year art, research and commissioning project, initiated by Sonic Acts and Kirkenes-based curator Hilde Methi, and in collaboration with Norwegian and Russian partners. Dark Ecology unfolded through research, the creation of new artworks, and a public program that was presented on both sides of the border between Norway and Russia in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The program included lectures, presentations of newly commissioned artworks, guided walks, a discursive program, concert evenings and a workshop. = Vertical Cinema = Vertical Cinema is a series of ten newly commissioned large-scale, site-specific works by experimental filmmakers and audiovisual artists, which are presented on 35 mm celluloid and projected vertically with a custom-built projector in vertical cinemascope. The 90-minute program premiered at Kontraste Dark As Light Festival 2013 and had its international premiere on 24 January 2014 at International Film Festival Rotterdam. A further four Vertical Cinema films were commissioned for the 2017 edition of Sonic Acts Festival, The Noise of Being. = Kontraste = Kontraste, a music and art festival in and around Krems an der Donau, Austria, was curated by Sonic Acts in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Kontraste presented sonic and audiovisual experiments, contemporary music and related art forms in a thematic, historical and interdisciplinary context. The programme offered unconventional concerts, live performances, installations, lectures, screenings and presentations. = Re-Imagine Europe = In May 2017, Sonic Acts announced Re- Imagine Europe. Re-Imagine Europe is a four-year project presented by ten cultural organisations from across Europe, with an aim to respond to the social and political challenges currently facing the continent. Funded by Creative Europe, the project involves artistic residencies, commissions, workshops and symposia.

History and naming In the 1950s, a real estate developer dammed an unnamed stream located to the west and south of Sussex Borough and created Lake Neepaulin. The lake was the center of a planned private lakeside residential community. In 2002, an organization known as Friends of Lake Neepaulin, began using \\"Neepaulakating Creek\\" as a new name for an unnamed stream that was dammed to create the lake. After a review of resources available on the internet, topographic maps, and other government and historical documents, a state engineer reported there was no evidence the stream had any previous name.Correspondence from William P. Graff (NJDEP) to Roger L. Payne (USGS) (September 9, 2002). Retrieved June 26, 2015. The name chosen, Neepaulakating, was a combination of portions of the names \\"Neepaulin\\" and \\"Papakating\\".

Overview =Mission Statement= \\"The WASC is deeply committed to the continuation and expansion of leadership development in the State of Wisconsin.\\" History The Wisconsin Association of School Councils founded at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1935. In that year, it was named the Wisconsin High School Student Council Association. (WHSSCA) From 1935 to 1946, WHSSCA held statewide conferences for high school student councils, sponsored by and at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1946, Gerald Van Pool voiced concern about the how the organization was being run. He then began serving as the Executive Secretary to strengthen the organization of the association. Van Pool accepted a job at the National Student Council Association in Washington, D.C., in 1947 after serving as Executive Secretary for one year. Van Pool influenced the WHSSCA into joining the National Student Council Association. In January 1948, the name of the association changed from the Wisconsin High School Student Council Association (WHSSCA) to the Wisconsin Association of Student Councils (WASC) This happened under the direction of Bernard A. Kennedy of Prairie du Chien, the Executive Secretary from 1947‚Äì1951. The WASC‚Äôs third Executive Secretary was George Heatherington of La Crosse, (1951‚Äì1957), the fourth was Ralph Mithy of Janesville, (1957‚Äì1959) and the fifth was Donald A. Wendt of Madison (1959‚Äì1972). During Wendt‚Äôs term, the WASC was subject to protest and request to change, but the association remained constant. In YEAR, a monthly Newsletter was created and was edited by the Executive Secretary. In 1961, Gerald Van Pool and Donald A. Wendt structured the first WASC Summer Leadership Workshop, held in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. In 1972, the sixth Executive Secretary, Larry Hanson, Plainfield, was elected (1972‚Äì1973). During his term, a new constitution and by-laws were established, and the Wisconsin Secondary School Administrators Association (WSSAA) began sponsoring the WASC. The new constitution was ratified in October 1973, which created a State Governing Board and Executive Committee. These consisted of an equal ratio of students and adults elected from within six regions. There was to be also an equality of representation of junior and middle school (JAM) and senior high schools (SHS). The member schools of each region were required to have two annual meetings, and the state conference was moved from fall to spring. With the implication of the State Governing Board and Executive Committee and new stipulations, the WASC became the country's only student council organization with equality of students and adults as voting representatives. Donald C. Larsen was hired in the fall of 1973 and worked as the first shared WSSAA/WASC Executive, and served as the WASC's Executive Director, a position previously named Executive Secretary (1973‚Äì2000). To more correctly describe school involvement in their organization, the WASC replaced the word \\"Student\\" with the word \\"School\\" in their title; making their name the Wisconsin Association of School Councils. Larsen created a foundation committed to enhancing student leadership in the WASC. The WASC State office was created in Stevens Point, but moved to Madison in 1979. A series of programs were established in the 1970s and 1980s for students and advisors to advance their leadership abilities. Some include Annual WASC Advisor Conference (1973), Cheer/Poms Camps (1975), Annual Nation Honor Society State Conference (1977), and Annual Elementary School State Conference (1979), Advanced Summer Leadership Camps, Wisconsin Association of Cheer/Pom Coaches (WACPC) (1988). In the 1990s, two more state offices were added to the organization for JAM schools. On December 15, 1997, the WASC Governing Board approved the WASC FOUNDATION and ENDOWMENT organization and the WASC TORCH BEARERS. Succeeding Donald C. Larsen as Executive Director was Roger L. Chambers (2000‚Äì2005), then Michelle McGrath (2000-). Structure =Regions= The WASC splits Wisconsin into six regions. Those are, I: Whitetail Region; II: Northlands Region; III: Fox River Valley Region; IV: Metropolitan Region; V: Capitol Region; VI: Big Rivers Region. Each region has their own bylaws and elect new Regional Officers each year. Student officers serve for one year, and adults serve for three years. =Regional Bylaws= Each regions' bylaws consist of ordinances regarding name, membership, organization and management, caucuses, regional officers, duties of regional officers, vacancies, and amendments.

Early life Dixon was born in Bath, UK. He moved with his family to Andalusia, Spain when he was seven years old. Studying art and design he began working as a graphic artist and moved to Australia in his late teens. Career After graduating from Art college, Dixon began his career in marketing by working for a Japanese publishing house and spent time in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. After several years he returned to Austria and hired a small film studio where he wrote, directed, edited, produced, and animated, \\"Force Five\\" a stop animation film. \\"Force Five\\" followed five secret agents who were part of C.E.N.T.E.R (Central Enforcement Network Targeting Evil Rogues) who would parachute into southern Bavaria during WW2 in order to kill the head of O.C.T.O (Official Crime & Terror Organisation). Dixon built the sets and designed the miniature characters by using remote control technology with mini servers in the characters heads. The movie was shot on a Bolex 16mm film camera. To fund his film he word work part-time for a SPFX company, building movie props and set pieces for Fox Studios. Moving to Sydney in 2001, Dixon began working on his first feature film. The story follows two brothers trapped inside a comic book and caught up in a scheme to blackmail the Devil out of his souls. Shot on super 16mm, the film premiered in Sydney and went on to win \\"Best International Feature\\" in LA. In 2007 Dixon wrote the screenplay for Origin Unknown, a WW2 horror/creature movie that takes place in the catacombs of German occupied Paris on 19 August 1944, the day of liberation. He produced and directed a 6-minute faux scene segment for it and began shopping it around the studios in Hollywood. While under the management of The Collective, in Beverly Hills, the film was being packaged and pre sold to foreign territories Dixon was signed to the Paradigm Talent Agency. Once the global financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 hit, many of the financiers were forced to back out of the project leaving it in limbo. After trying to resurrect it Dixon later signed with (WME) William Morris Endeavor to develop other projects. In 2010, Dixon returned to Australia and began working on his next film Wrath, a horror film set in the Australian outback.

Wilder-Smith specializes in the use of light and optics in tracking and treating oral cancer. She has developed innovative noninvasive laser technology used to examine and treat mouth lesions. Career Wilder-Smith attended Guy's Hospital at the University of London (United Kingdom), receiving her dental degree with honors and distinction in July, 1983. Also in 1983, she was awarded the Diplomate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain. In 1985, Wilder-Smith received a doctorate from the University of Bern (Switzerland) for her work in restorative dentistry. Wilder-Smith served as junior faculty at Guy's Hospital in the department of oral medicine and at Heidelberg University in Germany, gaining certification in the specialty of oral medicine from Heidelberg in 1986. She was awarded the inaugural Research Prize for Endodontology by the European Society of Endodontology in 1987 for her innovative work applying Laser Doppler flowmetry techniques to oral research. While at Heidelberg, she received the University's Best Clinician Award in 1988, and Best Lecturer Award and Stauffenberg Award for innovative research in 1989. In 1999, Wilder-Smith was awarded a doctorate in biomedical optics from Aachen University. In 1991, Wilder-Smith joined the Beckman Laser Institute at the University of California, Irvine as Assistant Director of the Dental Program. She became Associate Director of the Dental Program and Adjunct Assistant Professor as of 1993, Director of Dental Program and Adjunct Assistant Professor as of 1995, Director of the Dental Program and Associate Professor as of 1998, and Director of the Dental Program and Professor as of 2008. Research Wilder-Smith's research focuses on noninvasive optical techniques such as fluorescence and optical coherence tomography and their use in the diagnosis of oral cancer. She is particularly concerned with developing technologies for the early detection of precancerous and cancerous tissues in the mouth. She has collaborated with researchers at the City of Hope, UCLA, the University of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, publishing more than 100 publications in over 20 years. She has received funding from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Defense, and others. Dr. Petra Wilder-Smith is working with Dr. Zhongping Chen at the University of California, Irvine, Dr Rongguang Liang at the University of Arizona's College of Optical Sciences, and Dr. M. A. Kuriakose at the Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center in Bangalore, India to develop an inexpensive portable device for detection of oral cancer, which accounts for 35% of cancer deaths among Indian men. The solar-powered device, slightly larger than a shoebox, uses mobile phone technology to send laser images of oral lesions to specialists for assessment. Future laser devices may snap onto smartphones. By reaching patients who have little access to oral care, and diagnosing cancer in its extremely early stages, the potential for early intervention and more successful treatment outcomes can be increased. The instrument sends a beam of light through oral tissue to a depth of 2 mm. This is compared to a reference beam, and an image of the tissue surface and subsurface is constructed. The information gained about the microarchitecture of the tissue is similar to that gained from histological slides in a biopsy, without invasion of the tissue and resulting pain. 90% diagnostic sensitivity and 85% specificity have been reported. The system's diagnostic algorithm triages patients into three categories: no intervention required, monitor on a three- or six-month basis, and immediately refer to a specialist. Wilder-Smith serves on advisory boards of the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery, the Diagnostic Sciences Group of the International Association for Dental Research and the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

From a young age he was interested in performing arts. He has said that \\"My will to be an actor is the only thing that I completely understood in my life. I didn't know anything about anything, but I just knew from a very young age that this is what I am going to do.\\" Since Golan grew up in Canada, he said that he feels very comfortable speaking English and that the language gives him a sense of freedom to show his comic side. Career Golan attended Telma Yalin Arts High School in Givatayim.

The offensive consisted of separate operations in three different areas: Tell Brak, al-Hawl, and the southern al-Hasakah city countryside. Background The offensive =Al-Hawl= The offensive was launched on 31 October 2015. During the first week of the offensive, SDF forces captured a number of villages and other positions from ISIL near Al- Hawl, and to the southeast of Al-Hasakah city. ISIL responded by detonating a number of VBIED's. One of those VBIED's targeted an SDF convoy, killing and wounding dozens of fighters. A Canadian SDF fighter was among the SDF casualties that week. He was first reported to have been killed by an ISIL suicide bomber in a farm that was contested. However, it was later reported that he died due to blood loss caused by a bullet in his hip. A Dagestani ISIL leader was also killed that week. The SDF claimed that they were in control of 12 new villages since the start of the offensive. On 6 November, SDF forces captured the area around the village of Nazilah, including the Tishreen Oil Field. The second week started with SDF forces seizing parts of the Al- Hasakah‚ÄìAl-Shaddadi road and two villages from ISIL. By this time, the SDF forces had reportedly captured over 36 villages, 350 square kilometers of land, and killed 178 ISIL militants. Two days later, SDF forces seized a hill and two vehicles from ISIL. On 11 November, the SDF continued its offensive and captured al-Khatuniyah, northeast of Al-Hawl, while also advancing in the southern countryside of Al-Hasakah city. At least 7 SDF fighters were killed in the clashes. The next day, SDF captured two villages and weaponry from ISIL, while at least 14 ISIL militants were killed by U.S. airstrikes. On 13 November, SDF forces captured the town of Al-Hawl, killing dozens of ISIL militants and seizing large quantities of weapons and ammunition left behind. On 14 November, SDF forces captured three villages around Mount Abdulaziz, and also advanced near the Tishreen Oil Field, while ISIL detonated an VBIED near Al-Hawl. On the next day, four ISIL militants and one SDF fighter were killed, while a new VBIED was detonated. On 15 November, SDF forces captured Abu Hajirat Khuatana, Khuwaytilah, and the Al-Hawl Grain Silos, allowing the SDF to capture a pocket of ISIL-controlled area to the northwest of Al-Hawl. On 16 November, SDF forces captured the Al-Hawl Oil Field, to the southwest of Al- Hawl. By 16 November, SDF forces had captured nearly 200 villages, reportedly seizing 1,362 square kilometres (545 square miles) of territory. According to the SDF, 493 ISIL militants, 33 SDF fighters, and four civilians were killed during the operation. =Southern Al-Hasakah city countryside= On 17 November, SDF forces began advancing on the Regiment 121 base from the east. On 22 November, SDF forces captured the Regiment 121 base, Khama'il, the al- Melabiyyah granaries, the cotton factory, and the villages around it. During the next week, the SDF continued their offensive, advancing from the Regiment 121 base to the south, and from Al-Hawl towards the southwest, capturing multiple villages in the southern Al-Hasakah countryside and along the Sinjar- Al-Shaddadi road (Highway 47). On 22 November, SDF reached the northern part of the South Hasakah Dam, capturing the neighboring village of Taban. On 25 November, SDF forces captured the village of Ghunah, near the Jabisah Oil Field, to the southwest of Al-Hawl, and severing a segment of Highway 715. On 30 November, SDF forces captured Umm Madhah, and they also captured the South Hasakah Dam and the nearby village of Qana, bringing SDF forces within of Al- Shaddadi from the north and the northeast. Eventually, it was revealed that the SDF had captured 240+ towns and villages during the entire operation. Aftermath After the SDF captured the South Hasakah Dam on 30 November, the SDF continued their offensive southward, towards the city of Al-Shaddadi, ISIL's last stronghold in the Al-Hasakah Province. On 1 December, Arab tribal leaders were reportedly urging ISIL to withdraw from the city \\"peacefully,\\" in order to prevent civilian casualties and the possible collapse of the economic infrastructure in Al-Shaddadi, if a destructive battle between the SDF/Coalition forces and ISIL were to occur. It was also reported that ISIL was beginning to evacuate some of its positions near Al-Shaddadi, and that some ISIL militants were moving their families from the area to ISIL-held territories in the Deir ez-Zor Province, in preparation for the upcoming battle. On 7 December US airstrikes killed at least 36 civilians, including 20 children, in the town of al-Khan, near al- Hawl.https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/12/09/syri-d09.htmlhttp://time.com/4140046/syria- airstrikes-coalition-civilians/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle- east-35031531 On 14 December 2015, SDF forces began to heavily shell the ISIL headquarters in the town of Al-Arishah, in preparation for storming the town. By 23 December, the SDF had captured the town of Al-Arishah. However, on 23 December, pro-Assad militias attacked the SDF headquarters in Al-Arishah, but the SDF was able to repel the attack. The attack came after the pro-Assad militas had allegedly warned ISIL about a potential offensive on Al-Shaddadi, and urged civilians in Al-Shaddadi to resist any Kurdish offensive, earlier in the week. On 27 January 2016, it was reported that ISIL had banned civilians from leaving Al-Shaddadi, in an attempt to use them as human shields in the event of an SDF offensive on the city. It was also reported that food and other basic supplies were running out in Al-Shaddadi. On 31 January 2016, the US-led Coalition bombed 3 ISIL checkpoints in their stronghold of Al-Shaddadi, killing 14+ ISIL militants. On 16 February 2016, the SDF launched an offensive to capture the strategic city of Al-Shaddadi and the surrounding countryside. On 19 February, the SDF captured Al-Shaddadi city and the surrounding countryside. On 20 February, the SDF advanced further southward, capturing the town of Al-Fadghami. On February 21, SDF forces advanced further southward, coming within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of the Deir ez-Zor Governorate, and capturing the town of Markada. During the offensive, the SDF liberated 2,400 square kilometers (1,491 square miles) of land from ISIL forces.

It is a duty, which can be described as the Core Halal. In Islamic Marketing, firms must perform Wajib. Mandoob is something that is likable and preferable but not obligatory. This can be described as Supplementary Halal and should be done if possible. Makrooh is something that is despised and discouraged by the religion, and is usually only used as the last resort. * Mushtabeh are acts that Muslims should refrain from because they might be Haram themselves. Businesses should keep away from doubted acts like these. * Haram are acts that are condemned by the Islamic religion. Engaging in these acts is a sin.Alserhan, Baker A. The Principles of Islamic Marketing. Al Ain: Gower publishing. pp.6-7 Islamic marketing can also be defined as a process of value creation for customers and other stakeholders while keeping this process in accord with the principles of Islamic transaction. There are five principles of Islamic transaction (see below). History The history of business in Islam begins with Prophet Muhammad and his wife Khadijah who were merchants. The Prophet himself is known as a trader, and as truthful. The Sharia law that has derived particularly from the Quran and Hadith, deals with a lot of things like banking, business, economics, politics, contracts etc.Azizan, Muhammad H., Wahid, Nabisah A. Business in Islam: a Reviewed Essay. p.1. Since early days of Islamic History, Muslim business producers had to follow the rules and requirements of Islamic Sharia when conducting production and marketing activities.Eid, Riyad., El- Gohary, Hatem.,2015. Emerging Research on Islamic Marketing and Tourism in the Global Economy. Hershey: IGI Global. The focus on ethics in Islamic Marketing resulted in early Arabian merchants converting into Islam.What is Islamic Marketing, from islamicmarketing Since 2000, the importance of the Muslim market began to appear in consultancy reports. The majority of the 1.6 billion Muslim population are quite poor, but the number of consumers with purchasing power is significant enough for Islamic Marketing to be discussed. The goal of these reports are to educate Western multinationals about Islam and Muslim lifestyles. After this attention, research has intensified. Some research has been done on consumption practices of Muslims as well as implications of Islamic ethics on marketing practices, however there is still missing scholarly literature on the subject.Sandikci,√ñzlem, 2011. Researching Islamic marketing: past and future perspectives. Bingley: Emerald Group Publishing, Limited. On the 29th to 30 November in 2010, practitioners like scholars, academics, policy makers and managers met in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to discuss Islamic Marketing and branding at the \\"1st International Conference\\"International Conference on Islamic Marketing and Branding. The Journal of Islamic marketing was launched in 2010, and it lays the foundation of Islamic Marketing as a new discipline.  Definition: Value-creation Perspective  Islamic marketing can be defined as a process of value creation. He argues that value can be created in many ways including transforming product/services to make them more attractive for customers and buyers, socially interacting with stakeholders to increase a product‚Äôs valuation, adding symbolic meanings, and improving access to supply chains. Value creation targets not only customers or consumers, but also general public, communities, society, and the natural/living environment. Value creation happens at three levels: transactions, multi-level exchanges, marketing-systems. Such value creation must be in accord with the principles of Islamic transaction (e.g. harm minimization). There are five principles of Islamic transaction: \\\\- P1. Harm minimization and benefit maximization \\\\- P2. Riba is a non-transaction. \\\\- P3. Value is to be created through tangible effort. \\\\- P4. Mutual consent is the main condition of trade. \\\\- P5. Marketing activity must minimize the likelihood of post-transaction dispute. Ethics Islam has four sources for their ethical system, and these are the Quran, the sayings and behaviours of Prophet Mohammad, the example set by his companions, and the interpretations of Muslim scholars of these sources. These sources emphasize the importance of human well-being and good life, religious brotherhood and sisterhood, socioeconomic justice, and a balanced satisfaction of both the material and the spiritual.Alserhan, Bakr A. The Principles of Islamic Marketing. Al Ain: Gower publishing. p. 9 Islamic marketing ethics aims at maximizing equity and justice for the welfare of the society. It does this by inhibiting customer exploitation, and avoiding dishonesty, fraud and deceit in business. Any unethical actions will do injustice and go against brotherhood and equality of humanity which form the core of Islamic vision.Hassan, A., Chachi, A. and Latiff, S.A., .2008. Islamic Marketing Ethics and Its Impact on Customer Satisfaction in the Islamic Banking Industry. J.KAU: Islamic Economics. In today's society, business often relies on free market economy where firms experience the pressure of competition and seek profit maximization. This may lead to Islamic ethics being overlooked, which makes the application of ihsan impossible. In an Islamic setting, the application of ihsan can strengthen relationships with customers and communities, which will again improve a firm's public image and make it more competitive.Rice, Gillian., Sandikci, √ñzlem., 2011. Handbook of Islamic Marketing. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing Limited. Application of marketing To understand Islamic Marketing, it is important to remember that there are religious factors that define it. Islamic Marketing follows certain sets of rules. * Production and sales that are considered unclean is forbidden. Examples include activities that are related to marketing of alcohol, gambling etc. * Adulteration with something concealed in the sale and purchase is forbidden. This means it is forbidden to omit and fabricate the quality and quantity of products. * Sales and marketing of all the instruments meant for prohibited acts are forbidden, for example instruments meant for entertainment like lyre, flutes, harps etc., as well as gambling instruments like backgammon. * Sales and marketing of weapons to the enemies of Islamic faith, or any faith, are forbidden when used for war against Muslims. * Drawing pictures in stone, wood, metal, or any other concrete forms, of living beings from among human beings and animals is forbidden. * Performance of magic, as well as learning and teaching it is forbidden.  Islamic marketing as macromarketing  Islamic macromarketing focuses on reformed marketing systems which represent societal provisioning mechanisms designed based on Islamic values and principles and with a view to minimise long-term harm and maximise welfare for both Muslim and non-Muslim populations. Islamic macromarketing is a societal technology for provisioning a broad range of necessities supporting comfortable life directed to success in this worldly life and the hereafter. Islamic macromarketing must enable the individual lifestyle that is beneficial rather than promoting lifestyles that might involve long-term harm such as material pursuit or excessive consumption. Islamic macromarketing focuses on the question: ‚Äúhow well are marketing practices and thoughts serving societal purposes?‚Äù. Muslims, through engaging in marketing practices, should be able to help to improve living standards, community well-being, healthcare outcomes, educational institutions and societal justice. Issues There are several issues that arise when Islamic Marketing is introduced to Western countries. The first is the conceptualisation of \\"Islam\\" and \\"Islamic societies\\". The Western often has a set view of ideas, beliefs and practices called \\"theoretical structures\\", which makes it difficult for the Muslim world to define their own theories and philosophies. Secondly, it is easy to oversimplify and reduce the meaning of Islam to something that is purely a marketing tool. Thirdly, sacralisation of Islam can occur which will reduce tolerance and hamper the acceptance and growth of critique.Jafari, Aliakbar.,2010. Islamic marketing: insights from a critical perspective.

Its headquarters are located in Tokyo, Japan.  Overview  JFC is a policy based financial institution whose co-function is the provision of business loans to SMEs and business start-ups; and educational loans to individuals for school entrance fees and related expenses. All these are with the aim of complement financial activities carried out by privately owned financial institutions as well as improve the living standards of the Japanese people. The company has 152 branch offices in Japan, 2 representative offices overseas, and a workforce of 7,364 employees.  History  Japan Finance Corporation was founded on 1 October 2008 with the passing of the Japan Finance Corporation Act. This Act led to the merger of four policy-based financing institutions i.e.: * The National Life Finance Corporation (NLFC) * The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Finance Corporation (AFC) * The Japan Finance Corporation for Small and Medium Enterprise (JASME) and * The International Financial Operations of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). In April 2012, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation Act was passed. This led to the separation of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) from JFC. JBIC has since operated as an independent entity.  Operations  JFC has divided its operations in three units: = Micro Business and Individual Unit = This unit acts (Micro Unit) as a community based financial institution and provides loans to small businesses, business start-ups and educational loans to individuals. The the Micro Unit had made loans to 0.95 million businesses. It is estimated that 77,000 jobs were created and 110,000 educational loans are issued annually as a result of the Micro Unit. = Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and Food Business Unit = This unit (AFFF Unit) contributes to the development of domestic agriculture, forestry, the fishery industry and improved quality of food. This is by providing access to finance for individuals and businesses operating in these industries. = Small and Medium Enterprise Unit = Recognizing that SMEs play a key economic role in the Japanese economy, this unit assists in the development and growth of SMEs through the provision of financial support in the form of loans and credit insurance.  Ownership  JFC is wholly owned by the Japanese government.  Governance  JFC is governed by a five-person board of directors with Koichi Hosokawa as the Governor and Chief Executive.

Video games are becoming an integral part of occupational therapy practice in acute, rehabilitation, and community settings. The design for video games in rehabilitation is focused on a number of fundamental principles, such as reward, goals, challenge, and meaningful play. ‚ÄòMeaningful play‚Äô emerges from the relationship between player action and system outcome, apparent to the player through, visual, physical and aural feedback. Platforms that feature motion control, notably the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft's Xbox Kinect, Sony's Eye Toy, and virtual reality have all been effective in this field of research. Methodologies have been applied to all age groups, from toddlers to the elderly. It has been used in a variety of cases ranging from stroke rehabilitation, cerebral palsy and other neurological impairments, to tendinitis and multiple sclerosis. Researchers have promoted such technology based on the personalization of gaming systems to patients, allowing for further engagement and interaction. Additionally, gaming consoles have the ability to capture real-time data and provide instant feedback to the patients using the systems. Currently, several researchers have performed case studies to demonstrate the benefits of this technology. Repeat trials and experiments have shown that outcomes are easily replicated among various groups worldwide. Additionally, the outcomes have increased interest in the field, growing experiments beyond simple case studies to experiments with a larger participant base. History Since the early 1980s, there has been evidence in the literature of commercially available video games used for therapeutic purpose for different patients. The use of virtual feedback has been seen scattered throughout history for quite some time. However, though the feedback was virtual, the performances were not widely virtual until the 1990s. With the early-stage experimentation, not many positive results were found causing some doubt of the systems. Some even found that too much virtual feedback increased poor performance outside of the controlled environment. As virtual reality systems and virtual environments became more accessible and affordable, though, so too did the implementations of and research on them. The use of these systems in positive motor skill development began somewhere in the late 1990s as more researchers realized the benefit of internal, corrective feedback in such environments. Additionally, at the same time, researchers across the world began experimenting with the effect of virtual reality in therapeutic measures for anxiety disorder and phobias. With positive results, such as better motor control and lower anxiety in relation to phobias, coming from these experiments, researchers began looking into virtual reality systems as a form of rehabilitation in the early 2000s, and the research has expanded since. Now, common gaming consoles such as the Wii and Kinect allow researchers to use cheaper, more readily available systems in their labs, as well, opening up new possibilities for games and rehabilitation options. Case studies and use of systems in actual therapy offices have suggested that this field has the potential to impact therapy outside the lab setting, as well, making it a rapidly growing field of interest. Currently, several reviews of the findings have also suggested positive effects of this form of rehabilitation, garnering support for this field as well. Several studies have been conducted regarding the potential of applying virtual reality to different therapies. A systematic literature review published in 2012 analyzed 963 publications regarding virtual reality and rehabilitation from 1996 and 2010. Investigators found an increasing number of research done in the field yearly, from less than 10 articles per year in 1997 to more than 40 in 2010. More than the number of articles analyzed, this literature review found important issues to be addressed in future studies: i) the need to consider a greater number of participants in each study to best represent the target populations; ii) to improve the use of control groups; iii) to enhance the uniformity of the tests applied and iv) to execute more follow up studies in the field. These aspects would allow the comparison among different studies and the conceptualization of the results from different studies. Lastly, this investigation cites the importance of research in the field of virtual reality and rehabilitation, once the potential of this technology is recognized to support the neural and cognitive rehabilitation of different patients. Rehabilitation through gaming vs. regular methods Throughout its development, gaming in rehabilitation has gained a large amount of support for its differences in comparison to regular therapeutic methods. The biggest of these differences is the user engagement and enjoyment. It has been extensively shown that people feel more engaged in a gaming environment and less contained in a doctors office when interacting in a virtual reality, gaming environment.Griffin, Murray, PhD, Teshk Shawis, MBCHb FRCP, Rebecca Impson, MSc, Joseph Shanks, BSc, and Matthew J.D. Taylor, PhD. \\"Comparing the Energy Expenditure of Wii Fit-Based Therapy Versus Traditional Physiotherapy.\\" Games for Health Journal: Research, Development, and Clinical Applications 2 (2013): n. pag. 4 Nov. 2013. Web. Additionally, those who are able to participate in gaming rehabilitation have also been shown to use less energy than those participating in normal therapeutic methods. While this may not be positive for all patients, this is beneficial for those patients who may be elderly or have minimal energy to expend in therapy-type settings. Saving energy while still participating in therapy has proven effective for these groups of people, since they are still able to progress in their goals towards rehabilitation, but not over-work themselves in the process. On the other hand, normal physical rehabilitation routine requires commitment to lengthy periods of difficult exercise which causes the patient to drop out of the therapy routines. Rehabilitation through gaming provides the opportunity to address two important areas: accessibility of rehabilitation and patient motivation. The ability for gaming consoles to exist anywhere and be purchased by anyone also allows this sort of therapy to be quite personalized to the patient. Patients who use gaming rehabilitation have been shown to be more engaged in the therapy efforts and more likely to continue their therapy outside of the doctor's office than those engaging in regular therapeutic efforts. Being able to bring their therapy into the comfort of their own home and at a relatively low cost contributes to these outcomes. Additionally, as a result of their increased adherence to therapy and motivation to engage in therapy, patients who engage in gaming rehabilitation have also shown improved outcomes of their efforts. Another benefit to using games for rehabilitation purposes is that they have the ability to be customized to real-life scenarios more so than typical therapy methods do. When asked about their therapy, patients have reported that they don't see the relation to their every-day life when performing the activities. Instead, they see it as an activity they do simply in their doctor's office, away from their regular life. Virtual reality-based rehabilitation has the ability to be designed to introduce real-life challenges and every-day hurdles that can be seen in the real world. They're tailored to the needs of the individuals and to the environment that they are expected to encounter on a regular basis. This consideration contributes to the \\"ecological validity\\" of the rehabilitation method. With gaming through rehabilitation, medical doctors have witnessed cancer patients who utilize video games during procedures have a lower pain tolerance when using an active distraction vs, a passive distraction. Typical rehabilitation methods have also been seen to present difficulties to those participating in them. At times these difficulties keep anywhere from 30%‚Äì66% of people from reaching their goals for their therapy.Lucca, Lucia Francesca, MD. \\"Virtual Reality and Motor Rehabilitation of the Upper Limb after Stroke: A Generation of Progress?\\" J Rehabil Med Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine 41.12 (2009): 1003-006. Web. When the goals are not achieved people are generally made to participate in longer therapy sessions, more therapy sessions, or more in-depth and difficult sessions than before, such as constraint-induced movement therapy. In each of these cases, patients are generally forced to pay more than before and are also put through more work than they initially planned. It has been found through research, however, that virtual reality situations can likely increase a person's desire to participate in therapy and therefore increase their chances of reaching their therapy goals, unlike those left underachieved with regular methods. Physical rehabilitation The University of Essex conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of including the Wii in an established falls prevention training program to improve balance, mobility, and educate recovery from the instance of a fall. After a 7-week falls prevention training, the results indicated that Wii can positively support a standard rehabilitation, although the use of the game alone would not be encouraged. On the other hand, participants found the experience of Wii game as enjoyable, which can support patients engagement to training. A follow up longitudinal study would be needed to conclude if the incidence of falls can be reduced along time. Extending this study, another research conducted by the same University of Essex found that training with Wii can imply on mood and self-esteem. This behavior was observed in women who participated in this last mentioned research for fall prevention. As said by investigators, it would not be appropriate to generalize, however one participant who had the biggest improvement on the functional measures had the largest positive changes in well-being, which may indicate that the use of the Wii as an adjunct to standard falls prevention training can improve not only functional but also psychological outcomes. There are many advances in the physical rehabilitation community, advances such as technology has created a more effective and easier way for patients to approach their rehabilitation journey. Neurological rehabilitation Several games have been created to support stroke rehabilitation and to alleviate boredom and frustration patients can face with frequent visits to the therapeutic centers. The gaming therapy can be prescribed by physicians, physical or speech therapists to support the recovery of the damaged muscles and the brain to re-learn to control the damaged movements. As an example, 'Circus Challenge', created by Newcastle University scientists, is a Wii based game developed specifically to support hands and arms' muscles recovery.Video Game Helps Stroke Patients Regain Motor Skills , The Stroke Foundation Also,Wii Sports in Video Game Rehabilitation benefit the patient's recovery and provide motivation for alternative leisure actives. The difficulty of the game is increased as the patient recovers, and their progress can be tracked by therapists. Also to support the recovery of upper extremity muscles, ARMStrokes was recently introduced as a mobile app to help stroke survivors to complete their rehabilitation exercises. The game is a real-time application that provides a communication platform to facilitate interaction of patients with their therapists or physicians. Research to evaluate if this technology can positively impact the stroke recovery process is currently underway.Jin Guo, Ted Smith, David Messing, Ziying Tang, Sonia Lawson, and Jinjuan Heidi Feng. 2015. ARMStrokes: A Mobile App for Everyday Stroke Rehabilitation. In Proceedings of the 17th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers & Accessibility (ASSETS '15). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 429‚Äì430. Cerebral palsy has also been target of using games to support both children and adults affected by this disorder. Research has indicated that children with cerebral palsy can benefit from Wii games such as jogging, bicycling, snowboarding, and skiing to increase their physical activity levels. This physical activity can be challenging and limited to these children due to accessibility problems that financial and societal barriers impose, such as a lack of equipment or availability of exercise instructors, and even transportation issues. While there is great interest in using video game rehabilitation with children with cerebral palsy, it is difficult to compare outcomes between studies, and therefore to reach evidence-based conclusions on its effectiveness. Because video gaming is popular, it may help children's motivation to continue with the therapy. There is moderate evidence for improvements with balance and motor skills in children and teens, but it is not recommended as an effective therapy. One invention aimed towards Cerebral Palsy patients is THE ORBIT Gaming System which improves Cerebral Palsy patients with hand impairments. The orbit Gaming System contains the results of utilizing both hands to physically trains the patients strength in their hands while creating a fun environment for recovery. Mobile phone applications Expanding outside of virtual reality and gaming systems, a newer segment of video game rehabilitation focuses on games that can be played on mobile phones or tablet computers - mobile apps. While these are not necessarily the standard video gaming console, these are being seen more frequently as alternatives with the introduction of more and more smart phones in the market. As such, researchers have recently begun to experiment with how mobile phone applications can also contribute to rehabilitation measures. While still relatively new, this concept has shown to be effective in wrist and hand rehabilitation on multiple different occasions. Wrist rehabilitation through a droid-based game, for example, revealed that patients can have more flexibility in their therapy sessions by keeping track of their progress on their phone and taking exercises home with them. It was also found that they could create a more customized therapy session through use of a patient's mobile device. Increasing finger use after a stroke is another area this methodology has proven effective for. In this case, the common mobile app, Fruit Ninja, was used to track patient use of their fingers and control of their hand when making fine movements such as cutting a fruit in the game. Another app that can increase recovery is iTherapy, a mobile app designed for cognition and language rehabilitation. It allows therapeutic interaction between medical professionals and their patient that increases their recovery journey. Not only does the app keep track of a stroke survivor's progress, but it also allows the patient to send personalized messages when they have met their current recovery goal. This app is a therapist on the go. An app to improve one who has suffered from a stroke is called Dragon Dictation which converts speech into text which can help patients to work on their speaking abilities instead of writing. This helps recovering stroke patients to recovery some of life simplest tasks. Positive results suggested that a patient's interaction with the game could determine and complement other therapy methods being used. Evidence in studies show that these types of game systems (apps and haptic devices are effective in the rehabilitation process.  Results  The Wii Balance Board, which is bundled with Wii Fit, measures both a person's weight and center of balance. Timed Up and Go test (TUG) scores have been seen to improve after having engaged in gaming rehabilitation. Several studies have produced output that suggests that Wii games are able to effectively increase patients' scores after a certain period of rehabilitation through them.Deutsch, J. E., Robbins, D., Morrison, J., & Bowlby, P. G. (2009, June). Wii-based compared to standard of care balance and mobility rehabilitation for two individuals post-stroke. In Virtual Rehabilitation International Conference, 2009 (pp. 117-120). IEEE. http://doi.org/10.1109/ICVR.2009.5174216 Stroke recovery patients and patients with an Acquired brain injury are two such examples of this output. Both patient classes have been shown to display slightly better improvements when using the Wii game or Wii balance board than when engaging in regular therapeutic methodologies. Continuing past these classes, studies are continually proving that these scores can be increased in a variety of patients with a variety of physical disabilities and from a variety of backgrounds. In recent studies, professionals have proven that the therapist and patient create a positive relationship during physical rehabilitation with video games. Balance and energy expenditure are other great improvements seen amongst patients of gaming rehabilitation methods. Methods such as using the Wii Fit board and Wii Sports games have proven effective at increasing these numbers amongst a variety of patients. Elderly and cerebral palsy patients have been the focus of these outputs, as both have the ability to improve these categories of their lives. Specifically, elderly have been shown to display poor balance and mobility due to aging conditions, resulting in a need for rehabilitation intervention and cerebral palsy patients display a combination of poor posture and poor balance which result in a need for therapy, as well. Both, after a period of engaging in a variety of Wii-based games, have shown improvement comparable to, or better than, what they display during regular methodologies, gaining support for these systems. Specifically, for the elderly community, interactive video-game based system exercise on the balance can improve balance after 6 weeks of implementation Elderly patients with Parkinson's disease showed improved performance in activities of daily living after 14 sessions of balance training, with no additional advantages associated with the Wii-based motor and cognitive training. Finally, motor- skill rehabilitation has been proposed as another possible way in which games can be used for rehabilitation purposes. Stroke patients suffering upper extremity motor difficulties have been the primary focus of this subject and, in this case, a variety of gaming environments have been experimented with. Output has shown that their Fugl-Meyer UE scores and their Functional Independence Measure scale score increase after a period of engaging in virtual rehabilitation, suggesting that their mobility dysfunction decreased and their degree of independence increased due to the intervention. Additionally, output has suggested improved motor skills on a higher level, having several researchers suggesting positive improvements in their stroke patients as a result of virtual rehabilitation methods. At this higher level, researchers have suggested improved ability to walk, or ambulation, and improved use of larger motor skills after intervention. One other class of patients that has been studied less frequently in this category of rehabilitation is cerebral palsy patients. Ability to walk certain distances without the use of an assistive device was the method of measurement for this category. After a period of working with a Wii-based system, it was shown that a patient who struggled with walking large distances before, was able to walk a noticeably longer distance. This suggests an improvement in larger motor skills, whereas the stroke patients demonstrated an improvement in finer motor skills, focused strictly on their use of upper extremities during the gaming rehabilitation. =Negative results= If by one hand rehabilitation through gaming may be beneficial since it can improve motivation to the rehabilitation and reduce distraction from the routine of a tedious medical treatment, injuries arisen from excessive gameplay have been occasionally reported, such as tendonitis, dislocation of patella or hand laceration. A recent study proves that when incorporating video games into a patient's therapy routine can increase their chance of developing musculoskeletal. Although these injuries might be occasional or rare, a large scale study would be needed to investigate the occurrence of these damages facing the millions of users of games worldwide. It's also been suggested that the use of gaming systems for home-based rehabilitation may promote a lack of communication between the therapist and the patient. In these cases, it is difficult to track the progress of the patient appropriately, and the effects of the therapy are unknown. It's also possible in these scenarios that a lack of tracking also increases time spent on task, since the therapist does not properly see what level the patient is performing at. Another challenge in video game rehabilitation, can result to lack of computer skills on the part of therapists, lack of support infrastructure, expensive equipment, inadequate communication infrastructure, and patient safety concerns. Additionally, common effects of virtual reality environments, such as dizziness, nausea, and disorientation, have also been found to result in the case of rehabilitation through these methodologies. As these scenarios work the same as other virtual reality scenarios, they are not exempt from the negative results that can be seen across the board from these sorts of systems, and patients have shown this to be evident. Virtual reality systems have also proven difficult to maintain and sanitize after use, which has caused some to stray away from their use and stick to regular methodologies instead.Burdea, Grigore. \\"Keynote address: Virtual rehabilitation-benefits and challenges.\\" 1st International Workshop on Virtual Reality Rehabilitation (Mental Health, Neurological, Physical, Vocational) VRMHR. sn, 2002. Finally, gaming technology is believed to promote physical activity on clinical populations with multiple sclerosis, although there is no consensus about training duration, intensity or outcomes used to assess the clinical effectiveness, which suggests that randomized controlled trial should be carried out comparing gaming technology to traditional exercise for this population. Similarly, the same can be said with results in the field of video game rehabilitation with elderly patients. While there are consensus's being built, there are still some results that seem insignificant in their findings and remain inconclusive either way. There is not much data available about adverse results such as falls when using video games as part of rehabilitation.  Theories  In the next 100 years, researchers believe technology will be at the heart of occupational therapy as a fundamental part of human occupation and the human experience. Moving in the future, technology will grow stronger and stronger and will emerge deeply into the occupational career. Video game rehabilitation will take over the occupation career and what it use to be.

She has conducted research all over the world and is one of the scientists Thomson Reuter's has named as most cited scientists since 2006. She is known for her work with purinergic receptors and identification of GPR17. In 2014 she was awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic for her individual scientific accomplishments. Biography Maria Pia Abbracchio was born in Milan and completed her initial education there. In 1979, she earned a master's degree in Pharmacy and then studied as a post-graduate from 1980 to 1981 at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. In 1984, she completed a specialization in toxicology from the University of Milan, a PhD in Experimental Medicine at Rome in 1988, and post-doctoral studies as an Honorary Research Fellow at the University College London from 1992 to 1993. In 1994, she worked with Professor Geoffrey Burnstock, the scientist who named purinergic receptors and then she became the founder of the Purine Club, a non-profit scientific association for international researchers studying the pathophysiology of purinergic transmission. Since 2003, she has worked with an interdisciplinary group of scientists to improve scientific research at institutions both within Italy and abroad. In 2006, Abbracchio presented findings at a symposium in Atlanta for the Society for Neuroscience which illustrates the approach of using biochemical compounds at the cellular level to inhibit brain damage after stroke. Her work has proven that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)s play a role in controlling cellular behavior. By combining research efforts from various scientific disciplines, scientists are looking at neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and even heart attacks and stroke to see how various drugs interact with GPCRs. One receptor identified early in her research by Abbracchio, called GPR17, has shown that it reacts with certain drugs to reduce brain inflammations and improve memory and learning abilities. Abbracchio is a full professor of Pharmacology at the University of Milan and directs a team of 12 scientific researchers at the Research Observatory of the university. She has authored or co-authored some 150 scientific papers and since 2006 has been listed on the Thomson Reuter's list of most cited researchers. In 2014, she was awarded the level of Commander in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by the President of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 15, 2016, and is written by Damien Fahey and directed by Julius Wu. The title is a play on the 1998 German film Run Lola Run. Plot During lunchtime at school, Principal Shepherd reminds the students to nominate for this year's Homecoming King. After a brief discussion, Chris is nominated by just his best friend Neil Goldman. At home, Chris announces the news to Lois, Brian, and Stewie, to Lois' concern. The next day, Chris unexpectedly wins the election, much to the surprise of Lois, Brian, and Stewie, who had come to console him after he lost. Meanwhile, at the Drunken Clam, Cleveland leaves for a moment to go to the bathroom. Peter, Joe, and Quagmire head out, leaving Cleveland to pay the bill for the boys. Cleveland complains to Jerome, and they bond over more drinks. Later, Cleveland ditches his friends to hang out with Jerome, surprising them. Wanting to get Cleveland back, they decide to try and win him back through antics such as dancing foolishly on his lawn. All of these efforts are met with failure as Cleveland continues to spend time with Jerome. At home, Lois and Peter give Chris plenty of respect and congratulations for his success, causing him to act like a King. Meg however is skeptical about the votes, saying that they are part of an elaborate prank by the popular students, on account of the high school's liking of \\"making unpopular kids look stupid\\". Brian and Stewie go to the school to clarify this. They attempt to disguise themselves and sneak in, but Brian gets distracted by two attractive teen girls and is subsequently thrown out of the school. At night, they see a news story about Chris, 'a big guy with a heart of dreams', becoming homecoming king, and realize after hearing his interviewed classmates responses that he was elected because they pitied him upon knowing of his \\"records\\". When Chris comes home he continues to believe he is a King of high importance and power, much to Stewie and Brian's irritation. The next day, an exasperated Brian reveals the truth to a skeptical Chris, who refuses to believe it. After Peter, Joe, and Quagmire unsuccessfully attempt a third method to get Cleveland back, they address the idea that Cleveland may be hanging out with Jerome because they're both black people. They head to the Brown house dressed like famous black people to win Cleveland back, but he reveals that he is still angry about the unsettled bar tab he was stuck with and feels Jerome is a better friend. That night, Cleveland tells Jerome of the guys' theory and learns that there's some truth behind it, as Jerome personally considers Cleveland boring but feels a connection to him because of their shared race nonetheless. Brian and Stewie attend the homecoming dance after Stewie realizes that they were a little too harsh on him and should support him anyway. Principal Shepherd introduces Chris as the prom king. However, when Chris steps up to give another bizarre speech, his classmates give sympathetic comments. When Principal Shepard introduces the Homecoming Queen, which turns out to be a memorial to a girl who died in a car accident, it dawns on him that they merely elected him because they thought he was mentally challenged just like his father and wanted him to feel good about himself. Outside the school, Chris reconciles with Stewie and Brian, having learned from the experience that he doesn't need pity, just support from his family and friends. After reuniting and patching things up with his friends at the Griffins' house, Cleveland plays Double Dribble with Peter, where Peter takes advantage of a glitch. Peter starts to win, but hits a wrong button at the last minute before the episode ends. Reception The episode received an audience of 2.65 million, making it the second-most watched show on Fox that night behind The Simpsons. =Controversy= Fox received complaints after the original video of the Double Dribble gameplay used in the episode, from YouTube content creator 'sw1tched's channel was taken down due to a copyright claim. Fox later released a public statement that the copyright claim had been made by a programmed bot that looks for any possible stolen Family Guy clips, and that Fox slapped the copyright claim unwittingly. Seth MacFarlane also apologized for the incident on Twitter, saying that he was out of the country and was unable to get the issue resolved sooner. The original video has since been restored.

Biography Den was born in Asakusa district of Tokyo in 1931. Den's birth name was . His hometown was subjected to American airbomb raids in 1945, though he and his family were able to move south to his mother's home in Kagoshima before they were attacked. At the conclusion of World War II, Den returned to Tokyo and began high school, which he completed in 1952. While in high school, Den organized a strike that resulted in the removal of the school principal. Den suspected this organizing experience was one factor that allowed him to enroll into Waseda University that was governed by a leftist student organization. While Den studied Chinese literature there, he also had considerable involvement in several violent demonstrations in 1952. Consequently, Den was dismissed from Waseda. Den fled from Tokyo to escape possible arrest for his activities and worked as a laborer in a Kobe port. He had also traveled to Germany after working for about six months, but Den was reportedly unimpressed and subjected to racial harassment. In 1958, Den went to Sado Island for the first time. Den became familiar with a local style of taiko performance on the island called ondeko during his stay. He left the island after six months, but returned to the island in 1968 with his family with the intention of living there. Den died in 2001. His last words, according to a performer in Ondekoza, translated to, \\"We‚Äôre going to go with Ondekoza of Mount Fuji,\\" referring to the decision to move the group from Sado Island to the city of Fuji in Shizuoka prefecture, and rename it accordingly. Ondekoza Shortly after Den permanently resided on Sado Island, Den held a summer class on music in 1970; Den was interested in revitalizing public interest in taiko performance and in Japanese folk music in general. In 1971, Den officially founded Ondekoza, and some of the approximately 40 students who attended the summer class became some of the core members of Ondekoza. Performers in Ondekoza lived on Sado Island in a communal setting, and Den had them undergo a rigorous training regiment including a 10-kilometer run every morning at 4:00 AM.
