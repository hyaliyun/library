He is also a member of the Metacosa Movement.  Biography  As an athlete he played in the Sailing Viareggio, together with his brother Francesco Luporini before the Serie A and then the national basketball team. He studied engineering at the University of Pisa in 1953 leaving studies to paint and move to Rome. In 1956 he was in Milan and participated in several exhibitions together with the painters of the Bergamini Gallery, taking part in the events of existential realism . She lives in the same neighborhood as a young songwriter: Giorgio Gaber . Between the two, after the casual acquaintance in the bar they both attended, a friendship began soon in artistic collaboration: the two write together the lyrics of the plays and the theatrical performances while Gaber interprets. The first collaboration between the two is, however, for a song played in 1961 by Maria Monti, Sono the ninth, which the singer presents on the record as \\"written by a friend of mine, describing Milan just as he would represent a painter\\" ; In the back cover the author's surname is incorrectly reported as Luparini . His pictorial activity continues: Luporini exposes paintings in the most important national shows, obtaining awards and prizes. In 2005 the City of Pisa, in collaboration with Adac di Modena, presided over by Adriano Primo Baldi, dedicates a personal exhibition to the Teatro Verdi. On this occasion is published in addition to the catalog of the paintings \\"Sandro Luporini - Metaphysics of the newspaper\\" with texts by Giuseppe Cordoni, Marilena Pasquali, Eugenio Riccomini, also the volume \\"Images, words and notes in the work of Sandro Luporini\\", a collection Of materials and texts on the theater of Giorgio Gaber and Sandro Luporini, curated by Micaela Bonavia. Sandro Luporini, together with Giuseppe Bartolini, Giuseppe Biagi, Gianfranco Ferroni, Bernardino Luino, Lino MannocciAnd Giorgio Tonelli belongs to the artistic movement of the Metacosa. The first exhibition was held in 1979 in Brescia, with the presentation of the critic Roberto Tassi.  The meeting with Gaber  So Luporini described the encounter with Gaber: \\"It was a very casual thing, in the sense that we lived near Milan. We were on the same bar. They presented me by saying that he was the singer, I was the painter. So I went to see his performances and he came to see my paintings. We became friends. I remember finding a kid who was nineteen, thin like a nail, and I went to listen to him. He played the rock in English, I did not understand anything, but I was bewildered by the energy he was wearing. We have become very friends, then we have often visited. At some point, attending our study (I had a studio with other painters friends), we spent the days talking. One day he said to me, \\"But why do not we try to write something together?\\" And so we started the first attempts that remained in the drawer, Because they were a bit extravagant and not so commercial. He then still performed through normal channels, television to understand. So at the beginning it was just a game, just a game. This is the first impact.

He worked for twenty years as a bond trader on Wall Street; in 2011, he started documenting the lives of poor people and their drug addictions, and commenting on the state of the society of the United States. He did this through photographs posted on social media and articles in various media, most often The Guardian. He does not call himself a \\"journalist\\", though some journalists object to his methods and other sources refer to him as a journalist. Early life Arnade was born around 1965 and was brought up in San Antonio, Florida, a conservative, Roman Catholic community. His father was of Jewish heritage, had escaped Nazi Germany and had become a professor in the US. His mother was a homemaker, raised a family of seven children (six boys and one girl) and then became an academic librarian. He went to college and then to Johns Hopkins University, where he earned a PhD in particle physics. Career Arnade started working on Wall Street in 1993 as a quantitative analyst. A former colleague told The Wall Street Journal that he frequently argued politics with other traders, most of whom were in the \\"libertarian wing of the Republican Party;\\" Arnade eventually tired of \\"hearing [traders] who had lost millions and gotten bailed out complaining that Obamacare raised their taxes.\\" Arnade called his work on Wall Street \\"intellectual grift\\". Arnade worked on Wall Street for 20 years, with the last position being on foreign trading desk at Citigroup. As the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 unfolded, Arnade became more disillusioned with his industry, and began riding the subway to its last stop and then walking home, which often led him through the Bronx, where he talked to people and began taking their pictures. He also did volunteer work in the Bronx, with the Hunts Point Alliance for Children, which led him into engagement with people who lived there. In 2012 his mother died, and that same year Citi shut down the trading desk he was working on due to new regulations. He accepted a buyout from Citi in 2012 and retired. Then, he began to spend all his time exploring the lives of poor and working-class people. To deal with the reduced income, his family moved from Brooklyn to upstate New York. By 2013, he had published a series of photographs of sex workers and addicts in the Bronx on Flickr called Faces of Addiction. That work was criticized by photojournalists, who have a system of ethics that forbids paying people. It also received criticism by advocates for poor people, as well as by Michael Kamber, a former journalist for the New York Times and the director of the Bronx Documentary Center, who said that Arnade manipulated his subjects, and that Arnade's pictures reinforced stereotypes and humiliated their subjects. Arnade in turn criticized what photojournalists do, and asked ‚ÄúWhat right do you have to make someone‚Äôs suffering pretty?‚Äù In 2014, Arnade started to take trips driving across the country, visiting small towns, many in the Rust Belt, as well as cities, and would photograph people and talk with them in the street or in the places where they spent time, like fast food restaurants. He also started getting his stories and pictures published in The Guardian and The Atlantic, which brought in some income. He mostly published on social media, like Twitter and Flickr. He came to a perspective that there is a division by social class in the United States between what he calls the \\"front row kids\\" and the \\"back row kids\\", with knowledge workers, including many people in American media, in the \\"front row\\", and most of the poor and working-class people in the \\"back row\\"; he explained the victory of Donald Trump as being due to Trump's articulation of the unmet needs, and unheard voice and hopelessness, of the \\"back row kids\\" and Democrats' failures to hear or address the needs of most Americans due to the Democratic leadership being \\"front row kids\\" themselves. When Trump accepted the nomination as the Republican candidate for the 2016 election, Arnade was in Ohio, but not at the convention; he was in a strip club in Parma, a working class suburb of Cleveland, watching people celebrate. Arnade identifies politically as a socialist.

She has released three albums: Two Horses (2011), Future Snowbird (2016), and The Shape of Your Name (2019) . Early life Cornfield was born in Toronto, Ontario and played piano, drums and French horn as a child. She began to pursue music as a solo artist after moving to Montreal, Quebec, where she studied jazz drumming at Concordia University. Career Her music has been compared to the work of The Band, Courtney Barnett, Bob Dylan, Randy Newman, Angel Olsen, Elliott Smith, Sharon Van Etten, Townes Van Zandt, and Neil Young. She has named David Bowie, Karen Dalton, Joni Mitchell, Lou Reed, Van Etten, Gillian Welch and Young as influences. As of 2017, her touring band comprises Bramwell Park, Craig Schram, and Stephen Tchir of The Provincial Archive. As of 2010, Cornfield also played drums in the band Bent by Elephants and the jazz quartet Takk. =It's Like That Here (2008)= Cornfield's debut EP, It's Like That Here, was released in 2008. =Collage Light (2009)= Cornfield's EP Collage Light was released in 2009. She cites Jeff Buckley, Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell as influences, and has said the EP deals with themes of \\"people coming and going and drifting apart\\". Reviewing the EP in Hour, Dave Jaffer wrote that \\"Cornfield is destined for good-to-great things, and new EP Collage Light is a harbinger of that.\\" =Two Horses (2011)= Cornfield's debut album Two Horses was released in October 2011. The album was recorded over a four- month period and features Cornfield on guitar, bass guitar, drums and piano as well as vocals. The critic Bob Mersereau of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation praised the album as \\"a strong collection of songwriter tunes backing by a solid rock groove\\", and wrote \\"there's a definite spark about\\" Cornfield. =Future Snowbird (2016)= Cornfield's second album Future Snowbird was released in March 2016 through Consonant Records. The album was recorded live at Rooster Studios in Toronto, Ontario, was produced by Don Kerr and features appearances from Tim Darcy of Ought and Johnny Spence of Tegan and Sara. Cornfield said of the album: \\"I think the sound of the record is more upfront than Two Horses. It's got a kind of raw quality.\\" The album's lyrics were inspired by Cornfield's time spent living in Brooklyn, New York City. Music videos were released for \\"Big Volcano, Small Town\\" and \\"Time Bomb\\". The writer Sean Michaels praised \\"Mercury\\", writing that \\"Her songwriting is ravenous. Even here, in uneasy happiness, [Cornfield] sounds like she will wolf down her life as fast as she is able. The windfalls, the crises, the concerts, the chance encounters ‚Äì she'll sprint through them all, collecting burs.\\" Michaels also named \\"Mercury\\" as one of his favourite songs of 2016. Sarah Greene, reviewing Future Snowbird for Exclaim!, wrote that Cornfield \\"usually opts for unlikely, slightly awkward rhymes and metaphors, her oddball lyrical choices walking the line between heartfelt and goofy but always quotable, with songs often landing in delightfully unexpected places\\" and concluded that \\"Kerr got some lovely organic performances out of Cornfield and the band, who sound like they lived in the songs a while before they recorded.\\" Liam Prost of BeatRoute Magazine wrote that Future Snowbird was \\"substantially more listener friendly\\" than Two Horses, but argued that \\"her narratives just don't land nearly as hard as she proves herself capable of on her older cuts\\". =The Shape of Your Name (2019)= The Shape of Your Name was released on April 5, 2019, through Next Door Music, an imprint of Outside Music. The album features collaborations with Kevin Drew, Brendan Canning and Charles Spearin of Broken Social Scene, Shawn Everett and Leif Vollebekk. A music video for \\"Andrew\\" was released in January 2019. Cornfield said of the ideas behind the album: \\"With this record I was really thinking about space and breath, and I feel like it came from a meditative space of reflection. My life up to that point had been a lot of push, push, push, but then of a sudden I was in my late 20‚Äôs, feeling a little more settled, a little bit wistful, and I think that really informed the songwriting process. I was not afraid of going slowly, and so there are a lot of slow jams and I‚Äôm alright with that.\\" Reviewing The Shape of Your Name for Exclaim!, Kaitlin Ruether described Cornfield's songwriting as \\"biting, lucid and nourished.\\" Ruether praised \\"Storm Clouds\\", \\"Andrew\\" and \\"Up the Hill\\" for their \\"electricity and emotion\\", and concluded \\"The Shape of Your Name has an elegiac quality to it: there is plenty of mourning within these songs, but there are also rays of a bright future.\\" Writing in Pitchfork, Joshua Copperman noted that the album focuses \\"on the patience and reflection required for relationships with others\\", praised Cornfield's delivery and songwriting as \\"authentically conversational\\", and concluded that the album \\"benefits from not trying to be a masterpiece. Instead, it stays small and approachable, a reward reserved for those paying attention.\\" The Shape of Your Name was longlisted for the 2019 Polaris Music Prize and named by Exclaim! as the fifth-best folk or country album of 2019. =In My Corner (2020)= In My Corner, a four-track EP featuring two original songs alongside covers of Lucinda Williams and Yo La Tengo, was released in March 2020. Other work Cornfield features on Joel Plaskett's 2020 album 44.

She is the head coach of the Spanish National Synchronized Swimming Team.  Early career as a swimmer  Due to the influence of her parents, who were both avid swimmers, Fujiki learned swimming at an early age. When she was seven years old, she began attending a swimming school in Osaka and started to learn synchronized swimming. When she was 14 years old, she won the Japanese National Junior Olympic and was selected to represent Japan at the Junior World Championships. In 1992, Fujiki moved to the United States and attended the Las Lomas High School in Walnut Creek, California. While she was in Walnut Creek, she joined the Walnut Creek Aquanuts, which was regarded as one of the best synchronized swimming teams in the world at that time. At Aquanuts, she was trained by coaches such as Gail Pucci, a world champion herself, whose creativity and the skill as a coach has been teaching how to be a teacher for the athletes. Fujiki also sought guidance from Santa Clara Aquamaide's Chris Caver, who remains as a close confidant and mentor to Fujiki since she retired from swimming and began coaching. The mentorship and guidance by these seasoned veterans continue to support Fujiki navigating her career to this day. While at Aquanuts, she met her future teammates and notable synchronized swimmers such as Tamara Crow DeClercq and Heather Pease Olsen. In 1993, she won the solo-preliminary category at the U.S. Open Synchronized Swimming Championships in Irvine, CA. After successfully completing her junior year at the Las Lomas High School, Fujiki returned to Japan in 1993. After completing high school in Japan, she moved to Tokyo to attend the Nihon University, where she studied English Literature and specialized in Intercultural Communications. While she was at Nihon University, she joined the Tokyo Synchronized Swimming Club. In 1995, she was selected to be part of the Japanese National Team for the 1996 World Cup. Then in 1996, she was selected to be one of the swimmers to represent Japan in the Atlanta Olympics. There were only team events at the Atlanta Olympics and Fujiki's team won a bronze medal. In 1997, as part of the Japanese National Team, she participated in a Duet event and won another bronze medal in the Swiss Open Championships. In 1998, Fujiki moved back to California to join the Walnut Creek Aquanuts again and took part in the US National Championships and US Open in 2000. She was also one of the eight American swimmers that performed in the Rome and Spain Opens in 1999 and 2000, respectively. In 2000, she retired from swimming and began coaching in 2001 at Walnut Creek Aquanuts.  Coaching career  Before 2010 Between 2003 and 2010, she worked as a coach for the Spanish National Team. She trained some of the most notable synchronized swimmers of that time, including Gemma Mengual, Paola Tirados and Andrea Fuentes. Spanish Team had a series of breakthrough victories under Fujiki's coaching, frequently competing for the top three medals with Russia, Japan and US. Fujiki led the team to win three medals in 2003 Barcelona World Championships (the first time for Spain to win a medal in World Championships), 2005 Montreal, and 2007 Melbourne World Championships. In 2008 at the Beijing Olympics, her team won its first silver medal. Leading US National Team (2010-2014) From 2010, she served as the head coach for the US national team, which competed in the duet at the finals in London Olympics. In 2011, she was the head coach of the US National team that competed at the Pan American Games held in Mexico City. Leading Chinese National Team (2014-2017) In 2014, she became the head coach of the Chinese national team. The Chinese team at that time was thriving but remained outside of the mainstream synchronized swimming paradigm. Fujiki introduced a new approach and concept and she led the Chinese national team to earn the highest score in its history, resulting in both team and duet winning the silver medals. Leading Spanish National Team (2017- current) In 2017, the Spanish Federation announced Fujiki's appointment as the head coach of the Spanish National Team. This announcement came during a period where the Spanish National Team had experienced a decline in scores, costing the team qualification to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. Fujiki entered the position with hopes to bring \\"a different approach to show the unique ‚ÄòSpanish‚Äô synchro\\" and \\"to build fundamental techniques in individual swimmers\\" with a new generation of swimmers.https://insidesynchro.org/2017/07/27/mayuko-fujiki-named-spains-new- head-coach/ In less than two years after being appointed as the head coach of the Spanish National Team, Fujiki led a team of young swimmers to earn a bronze medal in the newly established Highlight category in 2019 at the FINA World Championship. This feat marked the end of the \\"dark period\\" of the Spanish Team of not earning any medals in two consecutive world championships. Ona Carbonell, FINA's most decorated female swimmer, said when you are training under Fujiki, the athletes do not need to hesitate or resist anything because they can all trust her completely. Carbonell gushes about Fujiki's wealth of knowledge and experiences in terms of artistic, technical, and planning elements and calls her the most complete and comprehensive coach she has ever worked with.  Choreography  Fujiki received high accolades for her choreography, music selection and production. She has been invited by national teams in Australia, Greece, Hungary, the Hunan Province, and Colombia as a choreographer. Ona Carbonell, who is recognized as the most decorated female swimmer by FINA, credits Fujiki's routine for earning the 2019 World Championship medal. In this routine, Fujiki used only the speech of Nelson Mandela about how sports unite people instead of relying on conventional music as an accompaniment to the performance.  Speakers  Fujiki has been involved in the FINA's effort to promote synchronized swimming globally, and served as a lecturer at FINA's promotional program called FINA Development Clinic, which is part of the Olympic Solidarity Program, in Argentina, New Zealand, Cuba and Panama.  Other episodes  She was selected as Newsweek Japan's 100 Japanese Respected by the World (‰∏ñÁïå„ÅßÂ∞äÊï¨„Åï„Çå„ÇãÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫100‰∫∫). When the Spanish team won the first silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Spanish media recognized Fujiki as the catalyst who not only helped the team to excel, but also revolutionized Spanish training style. After Fujiki left the Spain team in 2013, one of the swimmers commented to the local newspaper how Fujiki's departure meant the end of synchronized swimming in her. Sun Wenyan, who was trained by both Fujiki and another Japanese coach, Masayo Imura, was asked the difference between the two coaches. Sun explained that while Imura places an emphasis on technique, Fujiki focuses on the artistic expression. The goal of practice under Fujiki's coaching is not for the sake of practicing, but for the swimmers to be able to express their emotions fully during the competition.

The record was shelved after the label went bankrupt and its CFO was convicted of fraud and sentenced to forty-five years in federal prison.[https://www.justice.gov/usao- sdny/pr/leader-pump-and-dump-stock-fraud-scheme-sentenced-manhattan-federal- court-nine-years. United States Attorney's Office. Retrieved on September 13, 2017. Eamon continued to write and record music. After featuring on a few Jedi Mind Tricks songs, the rap group's producer, Stoupe reached out to Eamon to record vocals for a producer's album he was working on. Both Stoupe and his record label were so pleased with the outcome, they decided to team up to produce the album that would become Golden Rail Motel.  Critical reception  Golden Rail Motel was met with international acclaim. The Canadian publication Exclaim! wrote that the album \\"showcases an artist in ripening maturity conquering his demons.\\" In a four-star review, the British newspaperThe Independent singled out Eamon's vocal abilities as the \\"most impressive\\" aspect of the album. The album was further praised for its honesty, intensity, and grit.

Early life and transportation  Maria Risley was born in England c. 1780 to Robert and Mary Risley. In August 1802 she was sentenced at the Surrey assizes to seven years' transportation for stealing from a dwelling house. She reached Sydney on 24 June 1804 aboard the convict transport the Experiment. Almost exactly twelve months later, on 25 June 1805, she gave birth to a daughter, Caroline Maria Risley, whose father was recorded as John Thompson. Contemporary accounts suggest that some time in the second half of 1805 she was chosen from a line- up of women at the Parramatta Female Factory to become the convict servant of the well-to-do marine officer Edward Lord, who had travelled from Hobart to Sydney to 'find a wife'. Maria and baby Caroline arrived in Van Diemen's Land in November 1805. Between 1806 and 1819 she and Edward Lord had eight children together. They married in 1808, after she was granted a free pardon.  Business activities in Van Diemen's Land  When Maria arrived in Hobart in 1805 she brought with her \\"a quantity of trading goods\\" and soon established a shop. After Edward Lord resigned his commission in 1812, he engaged in trading, land acquisition and hotels and became one of the richest people in the colony, while Maria expanded the retail business. During these years she played a \\"crucial\\" role in building up the import and export side of the family business and in re-investing their growing capital. She later did business in partnership with her brother John Risley, who arrived in the colony as a free settler in 1819. She acted as Edward Lord's agent and managed his affairs with his power of attorney during his lengthy absences. By 1820, she reputedly controlled over a third of the resources in Van Diemen's Land, controlling the supply of wheat and meat and a portion of the profitable rum trade through monopolies. Historians including Lloyd Robson and Manning Clark have blamed the Lord family business, and the Lords' exploitation of the colonial tendering system, for the corruption of the Van Diemonian economy and the displacement of the earlier small settlers.  Scandal and later years  From 1816 Edward Lord spent less and less time in Van Diemen's Land, taking frequent trips back to England. During these absences Maria acted as his business agent and played a prominent role in Hobart society. During these years she lived in Ingle Hall, where she hosted dinners and balls. Some time around 1822 she began spending time with Charles Rowcroft (later a well-known writer), a young English magistrate 14 years her junior who had recently arrived in the colony. In August 1823, Edward Lord placed a notice in the Hobart Town Gazette revoking Maria's authority over the family business, and in October Maria left Hobart to live at the family's country estate in New Plains. In 1824 Edward successfully sued Charles Rowcroft for \\"criminal conversation\\" and was awarded 100 pounds in damages, in a trial widely covered by the colonial press. After the trial Edward left for England with their youngest daughter, then aged five. Maria returned to Hobart and opened a shop and a butchery; she also managed a boarding house in the 1830s, and eventually a small store in Bothwell. She lived her last years at \\"The Priory\\", a property at Bothwell. She died on 22 July 1859 and was buried in a family plot at St Mathew's cemetery, New Norfolk.  Legacy  The historian Kay Daniels argued that both Maria and Edward Lord had been neglected by historians, and that Maria's life \\"illuminates a number of narratives which together make up the female convict experience in Australia\\".

She was a known figure in the Australian colonial legends. Biography Dolly Dalrymple was born at the Furneaux Islands, between Victoria and Tasmania, to Woretemoeteyenner (also known as Pung or Margaret), daughter of the chief Mannarlargenna, from Van Diemen's Land, and George Briggs from Bedfordshire, England. Her mother was kidnapped and held as a sex slave by her father, who then sold her. Dolly Dalrymple became the foster child of the surgeon Jacob Mountgarrett (1773‚Äì1828), of Port Dalrymple, who had her baptised with the surname Dalrymple and educated her in Western domestic chores. From 1825, she lived with the convict Thomas Johnson (1801‚Äì1867), with whom she had several children and married six years later, in October 1831. Earlier in the same year she had successfully defended her hut and children against an attack by Aboriginals while Johnson was away. She was rewarded by the government with of land at Perth, where she moved with Johnson and her children. In 1841 she was assisted by the government to bring her mother Woretemoeteyenner, then residing at Wybalenna, on Flinders Island, to live with her at Perth on the mainland of Tasmania. By this time, Dalrymple had seven children. The entire family moved to the Mersey region in 1845. Thomas Johnson eventually became wealthy and purchased in the modern locality of Latrobe where he founded Sherwood Hall beside the Mersey and Railton Road. Dolly Dalrymple often managed his estates during his absence. Her life story was very uncommon for an Aboriginal woman in the early nineteenth century.

He is also associated with Krogerup Manor in Humleb√¶k where a statue of him by Hans Peder Pedersen-Dan was installed in 1904. He was the father of Frederik Rostgaard and the uncle of Jens Rostgaard. Early life Rostgaard was born into a peasant family in the parish of Arild, near Haderslev, in Jutland, the son of Ove (Oud) Rostgaard and Kirsten Benneke (Bennik). . He learned to read and write in an early age. At the age of 12, he became a servant in the household of one of Christian IV's servants in Copenhagen. He read many books, both in Danish, German and Dutch. In 1644, he participated in the Battle of Listerdyb and the Battle of Kolberger Heide where his knee was injured. He then worked in the Silver Gallery at Rosenborg Castle for a few years. He became bailiff of Kronborg Fief in 1656 after his engagement to Kirsten Pedersdatter, the daughter of the estate manager of K√∏benhavns Ladeg√•rd Peder Christensen Svenske (c. 1590‚Äì1657) and Anna Jensdatter (1593‚Äì1655). The married on 21 September 1656 at Krogerup. the daughter of the owner of Krogerup and later took over the estate after his father-in-law's death in 1657. Second Northern War activism In 1658, with a regiment of farmers from Helsing√∏r, he twice participated in the defence of Copenhagen. He refused to promise Carl Gustav his loyalty after the Swedish army had occupied Kronborg and was for a while imprisoned but baled out. Together with his wife, he began to smuggle provisions into Copenhagen which was under siege by the Swedish troops. In October 1658, he informed Frederick III about the arrival of Obdam's fleet to the √òresund and began to act as a courier between Obdam and Christoffer Gabel in Copenhagen. In February 1659, he warned the government in Copenhagen about the Swedish plans of an assault on the city and provided it with detailed information about their preparations and dates. Later that spring, together with Lorens Tuxen and Henrik Gerner, he was a central figure in the plans to win back the control of Kronborg. In the forests at Krogerup, he arranged a meeting between the king's servant Corfitz Trolle and the British colonel Hutchinson who supported the plan. He also brought Trolle in contact with Oluf van Steenwinckel and later sneaked him into Kronborg. He received a small Danish army at Krogerup and stationed it with friends in Helsing√∏r. He brought Hutchinson and Steenwinkel the money (1,200 Danish rigsdaler in total) they needed for their participation and escorted Hutchinson's son to Copenhagen as security for his loyalty. When the plan was revealed in June 1659 and many of the involved were arrested, Rostgaard pretended to have died and managed to escape to Copenhagen where he went underground for the next 11 months to protect his wife back in Helsing√∏r. Post-war years Rostgaard was reunited with his wife after the piece in 1660. In March 1661, the couple was rewarded with full ownership of the Krogerup estate as their property, the rights of a noble and a promise of 300 rigsdaler a year for the rest of their lives. Rostgaard also got his position of bailiff back and was also appointed to fishing master of Kronborg Fief later that same year. He also managed Krogerup Ladeg√•rd and served as acting prefect (amtmand). In 1663, the crown discontinued his pension as a result of the economically difficult times that had followed after the war. His wife died on 5 April 1668. He then married Cathrine Asmusdatter on 11 April1670. She was the daughter of a merchant in Flensburg and had previously been married to the estate manager of H√∏rsholm Lorens Pedersen. She died after less than two years of marriage on 24 February 1672. In 1670, Rostgaard applied for compensation for the discontinued pension and received a number of minor farms and houses in the vicinity of Krogerup in 1672. On 2 February 1674, Rostgaard was married for the third time, now to o Dorothea Steffensdatter Rode at Nellerup. She was the daughter of merchant and royal factor Steffen Rode (1587‚Äì1638) and had previously been married to royal lighthouse keeper Peder Jensen Grove (1615‚Äì73). Through this marriage he became the owner of the island of Anholt in the Kattegat. In 1681 he was appointed to county manager (amtsforvalter) of Kronborg County. Legacy Memorial to Rostgaard and his wife created by Johannes Wiedewelts for J√¶gerspris Park in 1779-81 Rostgaardsvej in Helsing√∏r was named after him in 1898.

Adsit (pen name, Probus; May 21, 1825 ‚Äì April 27, 1902) was an American art lecturer, art educator, and writer. A graduate of Ingham University, she contributed for half a century to art literature. Adsit was the first woman to enter the insurance field in the United States, and, as far as was known, in the world. She was possessed of an unusual combination: great literary ability and excellent business sense. At the age of 13, she assumed charge of her own affairs and her future education. Some of her early writings aroused great antagonism, and her identity was withheld by her editor and not until many years later did she acknowledge their authorship. On the death of her husband, Charles Davenport Adsit, of Buffalo, New York in 1873, the widow assumed entire charge of his business and general insurance agency. After a most successful career in this line, she sold the business and resumed her writing. She contributed to the London Art Journal, writing an interesting series of articles for them on \\"The Black and White in Art\\" or \\"Etching and Engraving.\\" This brought demands for lectures and parlor talks on art, and she began a course of classes for study. For many years, she delivered these lectures in the principal cities of the U.S. and her name was prominently connected with art education both in the U.S. and abroad. Early years and education Nancy H. Warren was born in Palermo, New York, May 21, 1825. She was of New England Puritans lineage, and was descended from the Mayflower Robinsons on the mother's side, and from the patriotic Warrens of Massachusetts on the father's side, her father being a clergyman and missionary. Her early life was a discipline in self-dependence, which aided and stimulated the development of an inherited force of character, enabling her to combat and conquer adverse conditions, overcome obstacles and from childhood mark out for herself and pursue steadily a career that achieved success. At the age of 13, she assumed entire charge of herself and her fortunes. The expenses of collegiate study in Ingham University were met by teaching and journalism. Career Adsit was a regular contributor to the columns of the New York City Baptist Register, the Boston Recorder, the New- York Tribune and the Western Literary Messenger. Her earlier work was mostly in the line of poetic effusions and several series of \\"lay sermons\\" under the signature of \\"Probus.\\" These sermons aroused intense antagonism in clerical circles, on account of their latitudinarianism on theologic questions. Heated and prolonged discussions followed each publication. \\"Probus,\\" the unknown, was adjudged by a general council \\"guilty of heresy,\\" and the sermons were denounced and condemned. The series was completed, however, and her identity was held between herself and the editor, and not until many years later, by her own voluntary confession, was the writer identified. Meanwhile, the thought of the clergy, as of the world at large, had broadened, and the sermons were no longer under proscription. She married Charles Davenport Adsit, of Buffalo, December 13, 1862. Her home during the next three years was at 11 North Division street, in that city. Alternating literary, charitable and church work with her domestic duties, she developed an ideal home. They removed to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1865, where the husband died in 1873, leaving his widow charged with large responsibilities. Adsit immediately assumed the entire charge and management of a general insurance agency. She was the first woman in general insurance in the U.S., and, so far as is known, in the world. Protests from family friends and jealous antagonisms on the part of business competitors met her at the threshold of the work, but she won public favor as she gave assurance of ability, until the work was crowned with such success as to leave no cause for its further prosecution. Accordingly, Adsit sold the business, with her good will, and resumed writing. Her range of work reached from the political questions of the day to science and art. Her contributions to the London Art Journal for many years brought a request for a series of articles on the \\"White and Black in Art,\\" or \\"Etching and Engraving.\\" Finding no satisfactory data for thorough investigation in books, she visited the studios of artists as well as the workshops of engravers, gathering at firsthand the necessary information, even to the practical use of the tools of each craft. An entire year was consumed in this preparatory work. Months before the articles were completed the demand for parlor conversation on the topics which so absorbed her induced Adsit to open her home to groups of ladies and gentlemen, who cared to take up the study in earnest. The field of her labor gradually broadened, and from 1880, she gave lecture courses in nearly all the principal cities of the U.S.. Her name became prominently identified with art education, both in the U.S. and abroad. While Adsit disclaimed being an artist, she was a competent and thorough critic and elucidator of art. Her criticisms of prints, especially, were sought by connoisseurs and collectors. The secret of her success lay in the fact that her work was simply the expression of her own personality, including an abounding enthusiasm which carried her audiences. In a report of its Wisconsin secretary to the Association for the Advancement of Women, of which Adsit is one of the vice-presidents, the writer said: \\"To Mrs. C. D. Adsit's work is due, directly or indirectly, most of the art interest in our State as well as the entire West.\\" Her own adverse experiences quickened and enlarged her sympathies toward all working women, to whom she gave not only wholesome advice, but also substantial aid. Her home in Milwaukee was a center of art and of social interchange. She died April 27, 1902, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was buried at Forest Home Cemetery, Milwaukee.

History A merchant captain operating out of Port Royal, Jamaica in June 1683 reported being captured by Graham, and traveled to Boston to deliver a deposition against him. Jamaican Governor Thomas Lynch wrote a year later that Graham was not from Jamaica but was ‚Äúchief pirate‚Äù among the locals. ‚ÄúDoctor John Graham‚Äù was recorded as a ship‚Äôs doctor aboard a vessel which left Jamaica in 1684 on a trading and privateering mission. Graham led a mutiny, marooning the previous commander and turning the ship to piracy. A captured sailor reported, ‚ÄúThence they sailed for Virginia and New England, thence to the Guinea Coast (Gambia), and back to Carolina, where she was wrecked.‚Äù They had taken several ships off Sierra Leone, possibly under a different captain, possibly under Graham. After arriving back off the American coast, Graham was captured and jailed in Nantucket. He escaped with the help of some Cape Cod locals. Connecticut and Rhode Island officials put out alerts and warned officers to be ready to arrest him. Later in 1685 merchant Captain John Prentice put into New London, Connecticut, where a sloop under Captain Veale anchored by his ship. Onshore he observed Veale and his cargo master trying to buy cannons. Another merchant captain recognized Veale as a pirate who‚Äôd attacked him off Virginia and alerted the authorities, causing Veale to sail away. Prentice set sail a few days later, noticing Veale‚Äôs sloop alongside a 14-man shallop, which he saw was commanded by Graham. They pursued Prentice, exchanging cannon fire until Prentice was able to escape under cover of a thunderstorm. He sailed to Boston, where Graham‚Äôs reputation preceded him, and informed officials that Graham and Veale were nearby. Boston authorities sent out a privateer barque under Samson Waters to arrest them, but the pirates had made a getaway toward Cape Ann. In 1686 Graham and Veale were still sailing in concert, cruising off New England. Samson Waters was again commissioned by Massacuhsetts to hunt them down, again unsuccessfully.

Webb was born in Virginia in 1792 and spent part of his early years in Georgia and Florida. He taught school as a teenager, worked in the office of the county clerk and studied for the bar. He became an attorney in 1816. He moved back to Florida in 1823 where he established the community of Webbville in Jackson County. He served as one of the trustees of the first public school in the area, Webbville Academy. In 1828 he was named a federal judge for the newly created Southern District of Florida by President John Quincy Adams. In 1838, he moved to Texas where he caught the attention of President Mirabeau Lamar, who made him Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, and Attorney General of the young republic. In 1841 he was named minister to Mexico. He attempted to establish diplomatic relations during this time, but was unsuccessful. Returning promptly to Texas, he served for three years in the Republic of Texas Senate (1841-1844). He served again as Secretary of State after statehood. In 1854, Webb was appointed judge of the Texas Fourteenth Judicial Circuit Court, based in Corpus Christi, his new home. He was still serving when he died on November 1, 1856, en route to Goliad, Texas, for a court session. He was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, Goliad. Webb County, Texas is named in his honor. Early life James Webb was born to Francis and Frances (nee' Walker) Webb in Fairfax County, Virginia, on March 31, 1792. In 1810, the family moved to Janes County, Georgia, then to Hancock County, where the father died. At age 17, James went to work teaching school for one year, then moved to Essex County, Virginia, where he was hired to work in the county clerk's office. During this time he began \\"reading law,\\" a prerequisite for becoming a lawyer in lieu of attending law school. He served a tour of duty in the War of 1812, then resumed his studies and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1819. Life in Florida In 1823, James Webb moved his residence and law practice from Georgia to Jackson County, Florida. He had already married Rachel Elizabeth Lamar, and was expecting a second child. Meanwhile, she bore a son, Thomas Francis Webb. Rachel and her two children traveled south to reunite the family in 1824. In 1825, the Webb family welcomed a second son, James William. There were few attorneys in the Florida Panhandle, so he claimed about of land near a community known only as Chipola Settlement. James opened a law office in Chipola, and soon took on Peter W. Gautier, already a prominent figure in Florida, as his partner. Chipola had become established only a year before Webb arrived, and the area was already attracting many settlers. Chipola Settlement grew from less than 200 inhabitants in 1822 to more than 2000 in 1825. The land was well watered by several creeks and rivers, and soon proved highly suitable for agriculture, especially for raising either cotton or sugar. The Florida Territorial Legislature appointed a commission in 1827 to choose a final site for the county seat, survey it, and begin selling lots. James Webb was selected as one of the commissioners. Webbville Academy, Jackson County's first public school, was established in the new town in 1827. James Webb was named as one of the trustees. The commission selected an unnamed village as the temporary county seat. It happened that the village also contained Webb's law office and a general store owned by Colonel L. M. Stone. The legislative council also decreed that the Jackson County courts would meet henceforth at Stone's Store. A year earlier, Stone's place had been established as the site of a U.S.Post Office. In February, 1827, an advertisement in the Pensacola, Florida newspaper announced that the village had been named Webbville, Florida. The U.S. Congress approved creation of a Federal superior court for the Southern District of Florida on May 23, 1828. President John Quincy Adams signed the Act and, three days later, Webb as the new district's first judge. James accepted the appointment, resigned his Jackson County seat in the Territorial Legislature, put his farm up for sale and prepared to move to Key West, the seat of the new court. Hardly had he left Webbville, when a rival group from Marianna, Florida announced its intention to move the proposed county seat to Marianna. Quickly swinging into action, lining up political support, even as Webbville businesses were moving to Marianna. Dissident members of the Territorial Legislature pushed forward an act threatening fines for any officials who failed to conduct their official business from Marianna. County officials scrambled to relocate their offices to the de facto county seat. Webbville became the county's first incorporated town on November 19, 1828, but it was a hollow victory. The reality was that by effectively moving the county seat to Marianna, ended the rise of Webbville. The buildings were soon scavenged to erect buildings in Marianna and elsewhere. Before the outbreak of the American Civil War, Webbville had become a ghost town. Powerless to alter the events dismantling the town named for him, Jim Webb continued to work and live in Key West. They welcomed a fourth child, Charles John Webb. Webb's term of office would expire in 1838. He then resigned his post and moved to Houston, already a booming port in the Republic of Texas. Gone to Texas The President of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B. Lamar was related to Webb's wife through the Lamar family. Apparently he had heard through the family grapevine that a very talented relative was coming to Texas and would be available for work. Lamar sent word requesting Webb to come quickly to Austin, the capital of the new republic. Lamar needed a new Secretary of State. Webb agreed to take the position, effective November 18, 1839. He remained there for nearly two years before President Lamar asked him to serve as full-time Minister to Mexico, beginning March 20, 1841. Mexico had no desire to negotiate anything and refused to accept Webb. Unable to accomplish anything, Webb returned to Austin, where he became a member of the Texas Senate, representing the Travis- Bastrop-Fayette-Gonzales district from 1841-1844, and serving as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. President Lamar's term ended in 1841, so Webb opened a private law practice in Texas. Williamson S. Oldham, a former speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and onetime Associate Justice on the Arkansas Supreme Court, joined Webb's office as partner. Oldham was a member of the Convention of 1845 that cleared the way for Texas to become part of the United States, so he was already well known across the state. Post statehood in Texas After Texas became a state in 1845, Webb became a reporter for the state supreme court. He and Thomas H. Duval collaborated to produce the first three volumes of Texas Reports. In 1849, Webb was appointed Secretary of the State by the newly elected third governor of the state, Peter Hansborough Bell. He served until he resigned in 1851 and moved his residence to Corpus Christi, Texas. In 1854, Webb was appointed judge of the Texas Fourteenth Judicial Circuit Court. He was still serving when he died en route to Goliad for a court session November 1, 1856. He was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, Goliad, Texas.\\"Webb, James (1792-1856). Index to Politicians.

History =History of the district= 1833‚Äì1908 The area that would become the city of Kirkwood was settled in 1833. Education to area residents was provided under the public school system of the state, which was controlled by a constitution dating from 1820 that allowed for the education of the poor at public expense. Education in the area was subject to an 1847 state law that prohibited teaching African American or bi-racial people how to read and write. The state legislature approved the establishment of the Kirkwood School District on February 17, 1865, three days before approving the charter that established the city. The school district extended across a larger footprint than the municipality. Consequently, the district would be able to educate all its Black children outside of city limits for a period of time later in its history. The establishment of the school district in 1865 occurred in the midst of a sequence of statewide legislative events that affected the education of African American children. Missouri had outlawed slavery and freed enslaved people in January 1865. (The federal Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 had not applied to Missouri.) In June 1865, the state constitution was revised to permit the establishment of separate public schools for children of African descent; racial segregation in education became a requirement with the passage of an 1866 state law. That requirement would become codified in the state constitution of 1875; affirmed by the Missouri Supreme Court in 1890 (which stated that racial segregation in public schools is neither forbidden nor in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution); upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court (in the context of racially segregated separate but equal public facilities in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson 163 U.S. 537 (1896)); and repeated in the state constitution of 1945 (which did permit racial integration if other laws required it). The provision would not be removed from the state constitution until August 1976. In Kirkwood, the first school building, a temporary one, opened in the fall of 1866. It was for White students only and covered all grades. The district's African American children were educated in rented rooms. A.G. Edwards, founder of his namesake company, and A.S. Mermod had found the land and made the arrangements for erecting the temporary building. In 1869, the district erected a more permanent schoolhouse for its White students. Called the Jefferson Avenue School, the building was designed by E.E. Halsey and was located on Jefferson Street between Clay and Harrison Streets. Construction of the first permanent building for African American children was finished in 1870. Ultimately named the Booker T. Washington School, the school was located at 430 West Adams Avenue near what would become Geyer Road in an area whose residents included Edwards. The school educated children from the 11 Black enclaves within Kirkwood and its surrounds. Students‚Äîboth Black and White‚Äîwho lived in Meacham Park, an unincorporated area south of Kirkwood City proper, had to walk almost 2-1/2 miles and cross train tracks to get to the school buildings. 1876, the year after the state constitution was changed to require racial segregation in public education and not merely permit it, two rooms costing $1,600 were added to the Jefferson school, and an addition costing $700 was added to the Booker T. Washington School. In 1888, the district built a dedicated high school for White students. Called the Adams School, the new facility was located on Adams Avenue near the Jefferson School, which then became the Jefferson Elementary School. The high school offered a two-year course of study for students completing the elementary grades. In 1896, the district established the first four-year course of high school study in St. Louis County. Before then, White students who wanted to attend high school had go to Central High School in St. Louis City, first located at 15th Street and Olive Boulevard and then at Garrison and Natural Bridge. A high school education in Kirkwood was not available to children of color. In 1908, the Katherine Tracy Kindergarten was opened; it was the first Kindergarten in the area. Tracy was a Kirkwood resident who taught in the public school system in St. Louis city and was instrumental in getting the facility established. 1908‚Äì1930: Racial advocacy and expansions In 1908, concerned families living south of the Frisco train tracks requested of the school board that a school be established in the Meacham Park area so that young children would not have to walk miles and cross train tracks to get to school. In response, the district established the Meacham Park Branch School District and the Meacham Park School‚Äìfor the neighborhood's White students only. Located in a small rented house south of the entrance to Oak Hill Cemetery, the school opened in 1908. One source says its white students numbered 14, while another source says its white students numbered sixty-six as of 1911. The neighborhood's 52 Black children still had to walk the almost 2-1/2 miles to the Booker T. Washington school. African American parents living in the Meacham Park area approached the school board later in 1908 and again in 1909 and 1910, requesting that a school for their children be built closer to where they lived. The district declined to do so. Overcrowding was occurring at the Jefferson Elementary School, so the district educated some students in a portable building on the school's grounds while two additional schools for White children were being designed and built. As of 1911, the district had a high school with an accredited four-year program, the grammar school, a portable building and a Kindergarten on the grounds of the grammar school, a school for children of color on Adams Avenue, and a one-room school in Meacham Park. The district ultimately heeded the requests of African American parents from Meacham Park, and on September 19, 1911, it opened the Meacham Park School of Negroes in a one-room house at the east end of New York Street. Conditions at the facility deteriorated and overcrowding occurred, and the school closed during World War I. The district's John Pitman School, designed by architect William B. Ittner (a thirty-third degree Mason), opened in 1914. The Henry Hough School, with students from first through fourth grades, opened in 1915. The former was named after a physician who was also a president of the board of education, and the latter was named after a secretary and treasurer of the board. Pitman and Hough were friends with each other and with Hiram W. Leffingwell and Richard Smith Elliott, who had initiated the movement to establish the city. When the schools were established, both schools educated only white students. The district had intended to move the portable building from the Jefferson Elementary School to Meacham Park once the two new schools were established, but after a fire damaged the Washington school in 1914, the district moved the portable there instead. Five years later, the damaged Washington School was still the only permanent school building for Black children; their education in the district ended at eighth grade. Black children of color had to attend high school out of town, if they could get there and could pay tuition. In 1918, several families from Meacham Park appealed to the state legislature for help with getting Black children into high school. No action was taken. The local League of Women Voters became involved in August 1919 and protested such \\"inadequate educational opportunity\\" for the African American children of the area. On February 19, 1920, the League and concerned citizens met with the school board about the issue, making the argument that everyone benefits when everyone is well-educated, but the board stated that no funds were available. By July 19 of that year, the board relented and set aside $400 to fund tuition for Black students to attend high school in the public schools that would accept them, which at that time were Charles H. Sumner High School in St. Louis City and Douglas High School in Webster Groves. By November of that year, the board had authorized $40 to pay tuition for four Black students to attend the St. Louis public schools for one quarter. Families still needed to cover transportation costs, although the district later included transportation in its appropriations. The nearest streetcar stop was at Woodbine and Clay Streets, a ways away from Meacham Park. Parents had to rely on the district paying on time. By early 1921, voters agreed to build a new school for African American students, and African American parents met with the school board in April to discuss a site. While debates about the site and age-range went on for four years, architect Ittner presented plans for the new school in March 1922. In 1921, a new high school was built on Kirkwood Road, near the location of what was to become Nipher Middle School. The school opened for classes in 1922. Contracts for the work for the new Meacham Park School to educate Black children were awarded February 7, 1924. The school board also agreed to improve the Booker T. Washington School. The former would educate the district's Black children in grades 1 through 6 who lived south of the municipality's southern border, and the latter would educate the district's Black children in grades 1 through 6 who lived north of the municipality's southern border; all Black children in the district would attend seventh and eighth grades at the Meacham Park School‚Äìoutside of city limits. Two rooms of the Meacham Park School opened in September 1924, and the remainder opened in the spring of 1925. First-year enrollment numbered 230 children. The school graduated its first eighth grade class in the spring of 1925. Black graduates of the district's two Black elementary schools attended high school in St. Louis City, approximately 20 miles distant. In 1927, the district purchased five lots of land surrounding the Meacham Park school in anticipation of an expansion. In 1929, a bond issue was passed through which $250,000 was raised to expand and improve the Meacham Park school; expand Henry Hough School; and construct a new junior high school and two new elementary schools. Nipher Junior High School (which later became Nipher Middle School) was built in 1929 just to the south of the high school location on Kirkwood Road. Designed by Ittner, it was for the education of White seventh and eighth graders. The school was named for Dr. Francis Eugene Nipher, an educator and a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. In September 1930, Keysor Elementary School opened on land that had been purchased by the district for $9,000; it was also designed by Ittner. The school served eighty White students in first through fourth grade. The school was named for William Winchester Keysor, a retired judge and professor who was president of the board of education. The judge's wife was a writer of children's books and a proponent of adult education. Keysor's \\"sister\\" school, the George R. Robinson Elementary School, also opened in 1930. Located at the corner of Couch and Rose Hill, Robinson was also designed by Ittner. The school's namesake was a businessperson who had co-founded the Robinson Danforth Commission Company with William H. Danforth and William Andrews in the 1890s. The company produced feed for farm animals and changed its name to Ralston Purina in 1902. By 1930, the district had the following schools: Katherine Tracy Kindergarten, Adams Avenue School, John Pitman School, Henry Hough School, Booker T. Washington School, George R. Robinson School, W.W. Keysor School, Meacham Park School, Nipher Junior High School, and Kirkwood High School. To relieve overcrowding at the Washington school for Black students, all sixth-grade Black students were to attend the out-of-town Meacham Park School as of September 1931. Shortly thereafter, Black parents asked the board of education to rename the school the J. Milton Turner School, after a formerly enslaved person who had become a prominent politician. The school board approved the request in April 1932. 1930s‚Äì1950: Expansion The district expanded in 1931 when it annexed the nearby Meramec Highlands School District, which included the original one- room Osage Hills School in southwest Kirkwood. A new Osage Hills School would be built in 1938 at 1110 Glenwood South. In 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, the federal government announced that it had made grants available to fund school construction; consequently, the school district initiated an expansion to modernize by providing elementary schools closer to students' homes. It issued bonds to help fund construction and utilized the federal matching grant funds. The award of a federal grant to fund the building of three new schools, including a new building on the Turner School site, was announced in October 1937. The Public Works Administration was a grantor; the district also gained money by selling the Adams Street School to the local St. Peter Parish, which then razed it to make way for a high school for Roman Catholic students. In 1938, Keysor expanded, and North Glendale Elementary School in the city of Glendale (but within the district) opened in the fall of that year to relieve overcrowding at Henry Hough School in the southern end of Glendale. A new Turner Junior High School in Meacham Park was completed in 1938; the original building was still attached and was used for the elementary grades. In 1940, north and south wings were added to North Glendale Elementary School. In 1942, the old wooden portion of the Turner School was replaced with a brick structure for the elementary-aged children, and a cafeteria was added. In 1949, the district expanded again when it annexed the Meramec Highlands School District #51. Another wing was added to Keysor in 1949, and Westchester Elementary School was established in 1950. 1950s: Racial integration In 1950, the district closed the Booker T. Washington School, which left the Turner School in Meacham Park as the only school within district boundaries where the formal education of Black children occurred. The district stated that the state's Department of Education had recommended that the Washington School be closed and that keeping it open would lessen the district's reputation with the department. The closure occurred against the protests of the school's Black parents, who were concerned about their children being bussed far to a school outside of city limits. The school board did not act on these protests, and shortly thereafter, the Booker T. Washington School was razed. In December 1950, the district's Black parents brought a suit against the district challenging the constitutionality of the racial segregation in education. As of 1954, Missouri was one of 17 states plus the District of Columbia with racial segregation requirements affecting its public school systems, On June 15 of that year, the U.S. Court of Appeals sided with the plaintiffs in the 1950 suit, citing the May 17, 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka case that outlawed dual education systems based on race. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered Kirkwood's school system to be desegregated. Desegregation in Kirkwood would be occurring in the context of racial desegregation of school districts across the state, which were experiencing gradual progress. In September 1954, the Kirkwood School District's elementary schools were racially integrated, with Keysor receiving a new gymnasium and eight additional classrooms that year. Racial integration occurred at the high school in September 1955; with the high school moving to a new 47-acre, multi-building, collegiate-style campus on West Essex Avenue that year. The district reorganized; the reorganization included the 1958 establishment of the Rose Hill School and a new junior high school, North Kirkwood Junior High School, which was at that time for seventh, eighth, and ninth-graders. School catchment areas were set up based on \\"logical neighborhood boundaries regardless of color\\"; consequently, there was racial disproportionality in enrollment due to racial segregation in housing; Nipher's enrollment was mostly Black and North Kirkwood Middle School's enrollment was mostly White. Schools at this point included: Hough Elementary School, Keysor Elementary School, North Glendale Elementary School, the Osage Hills School, Pitman Elementary School, Robinson Elementary School, Rose Hill Elementary School, the J. Milton Turner School, Nipher Junior High School, North Kirkwood Junior High School, and Kirkwood High School. 1960s: Declining enrollment, racial rebalancing In 1964, North Glendale's gym was rebuilt, a south addition was constructed, and the school office was moved. In the late 1960s, district enrollment declined. Several schools were closed, including the Osage Hills School, whose students were transferred to Robinson. The building was used by the school board as its central office and site for board meetings; it was also used as a repository for books. The building was sold to the now-defunct St. Joseph's Hospital in the mid-1980s, which used it as a day care center until the late 1990s. In 1968, to prevent disproportionate African American enrollment at the Rose Hill Elementary School, the district created a joint attendance zone between Rose Hill and the primarily white Robinson Elementary School to rebalance the racial proportions in enrollment. The district was unsuccessfully sued by opponents of the transfers. In 1971, the district established a school offering an alternative to traditional primary education. The district also had a program for students in the eighth and ninth grades who were described as underachievers. Keysor's front driveway was built in 1973. 1970s: Reorganization to racially desegregate In August 1973, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) under the federal Department of Education requested the Kirkwood School District explain the disproportionate representation of Black students at Turner. In its response, the district pointed out that it had a biracial interpersonal relations committee and promised to take action. In addition, the racial balance of students and teachers was near the OCR's threshold of acceptability in multiple schools, with enrollment trends predicting increased Black enrollment at those schools, and it was expected that enrollment patterns would invite legal challenges. On April 1, 1975, the OCR accepted a desegregation plan from the district. The plan was designed to address racial imbalances, effect curriculum reform, and meet fiscal restraints. At the start of the 1975-76 school year, the all-Black J. Milton Turner school was closed \\"to an uproar of protest.\\" Turner became a neighborhood center providing community services. The Pitman, Des Peres, and Osage Hills schools were also closed. Children were transferred so as to minimize racial isolation. For example, students who had been attending the Turner School were shifted to Robinson Elementary School. Keysor's front driveway was expanded to accommodate school bus traffic. The consequence of the shifts was an increase in Black enrollment at Keysor, Hough, and Tillman, but Robinson's enrollment was 29% Black students, and other schools ended up having minimal Black enrollment. Teachers were also shifted among schools. During that reorganization, ninth grade ultimately moved from Nipher Junior High School to the High School, and Nipher became Nipher Middle School, where sixth through eighth graders were educated. Ninth graders also ultimately moved from North Kirkwood Junior High School to the high school, and like Nipher, the school became North Kirkwood Middle School. Innovative instructional techniques such as team teaching were implemented at the middle schools. Before implementation, district leaders laid the foundation for public acceptance of the plan by distributing fact sheets and holding coffees and community forums. Doubts were widespread, particularly among parents whose children were affected by the closings, although more students received bus transportation to school than before, which was of benefit to families. The changes were difficult for some teachers and principals. The district hired a human relations specialist to work with teachers. The district's desegregation specialist set up liaison functions between the district and the community's Black leaders and fostered increased communication among Black families. The desegregation specialist increased the district's ability to problem-solve, and set up an ombudsman system to address families' concerns. Numerous trainings for teachers and other personnel were held, some of which focused on new teaching methods instead of desegregation. Teachers and administrators developed and distributed a manual to resolve classroom tensions. The district improved its communications with families. Overall, the integregation plan proceeded relatively smoothly with little overt conflict. Also, the human relations specialist tested a suspension monitoring system to improve data on which future action plans could be based. For the 1976-77 school year, efforts took place at the high school to minimize suspensions so that discipline practices did not discriminate against Black children. It was felt that the desegregation plan was numerically successful, although a 1977 analysis by the OCR stated, \\"Whether it will succeed as an educational proposition remains to be seen.\\" The analysis stated that ongoing success would depend on support from the school board, teaching staff, and community. > \\"The administration must continue to encourage faculty and staff support for > its reforms and to prevent inschool discrimination. The district is working > hard to overcome or avoid such problems and ensure that Kirkwood schools are > providing quality desegregated education of which the entire community can > be proud.\\" 1980s‚Äì2000s: Facilities improvements The Henry Hough School closed in 1982, and its students were absorbed into North Glendale Elementary School, which necessitated a 1988 expansion. In 1987, Keysor expanded with the addition of a science room and a library. The Meacham Park community was annexed into Kirkwood city proper in 1991. The Kirkwood Early Childhood Center (KECC) opened the same year. The preschool is self-funded and non-profit, earning revenues from tuition, fund-raisers, and federal funding of early childhood special education. Bonds were issued in 1993 that allowed for additional school renovations. At North Glendale, the renovations included upgrading infrastructure for technology and conditioning, improving compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, renovating the library, and upgrading bathrooms and corridors. North Kirkwood Middle School was expanded and renovated. A fine arts complex was built at the high school, along with a commons area that was funded by a donation from Earl and Myrtle Walker; the couple, 1930s graduates, founded the Carr Lane Manufacturing Company and benefited the district with their philanthropy. In 1997, North Glendale Elementary School and the city of Glendale collaborated to improve the outside grounds and amenities for the use of both students and residents. In 2005, Kirkwood voters approved Proposition I, a bond initiative which provided funds for improvements and infrastructure as well as inroads to complete the master facility plan. In 2005, North Kirkwood Middle School was expanded and renovated. Prop I improvements at North Glendale included a new roof, fire alarm system, exterior doors, and plumbing; tuckpointing; and a new ADA lift in the gym. A new science facility was built at the high school in 2005. The Kirkwood School District Foundation raised $1.6 million in private monies to support the expansion; the Walkers pledged half of the funding. In 2010, Kirkwood city voters passed Proposition 1 to fund facilities improvements at its schools in support of the district's master facilities plan. A gym and classrooms were added onto Keysor, space was renovated, and there were safety improvements. North Kirkwood Middle School was expanded and renovated, as was North Glendale Elementary School. Other programs In 2009, the district established Vista, a separate setting with alternative programming for middle and high school students enrolled in the Kirkwood and Webster Groves school districts. Students learn their lessons via computer and work at their own pace; homework is optional. The program was established to help struggling students graduate on time. Alumni accounted for 7% of Kirkwood High School's graduates in the 2010-11 school year. General information Teachers are represented by a collective bargaining unit, the Kirkwood affiliate of the Missouri National Education Association. Approximately 130 of the district's faculty are members. Teachers are not unionized. Equity and governance In 2014, Robinson partnered with KECC to open a preschool classroom to educate future Robinson students for their \\"important year before Kindergarten.\\" After witnessing the unrest that occurred in the wake of the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9, 2014, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon established the 14-member Ferguson Commission on November 18, 2014 to examine and provide recommendations about conditions in the region that were impeding progress, equality, and safety. One of the Ferguson Commission Report's \\"Calls to Action\\" is to eliminate the options for out-of-school suspensions and expulsions as discipline practices for students in Kindergarten through third grade, because such removals from instruction impede long-term outcomes. During the school year starting in 2014, the proportion of suspensions meted out to Kirkwood's students of color was 3.7 times the proportion of enrollment that comprised students of color. In July 2017, concerned district parents described their children's experiences with suspensions to the board of education. The district put together a committee to examine the issue; the superintendent stated that personnel had received training about trauma- informed and restorative practices, and would be receiving anti-bias training. On August 20, 2018, the board of education approved a revised discipline policy which eliminated suspension and expulsion for elementary school students (in grades preschool through five) unless required by law; the policy also requires the use of restorative justice practices. On September 24, 2018, the district's Board of Education adopted a Governance Plan. One of the Plan's goals is to ensure the Board of Education's compliance with a district policy that holds the Board responsible for establishing educational goals to guide the Board and staff in collaborating toward continued improvement of the district's educational programs. The Plan contains the district's priorities (as previously approved by the Board of Education), objectives, and forty-four SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.) The Plan is grounded in extensive stakeholder input and data. The Governance Plan's Governance Priorities are: Equity for All; Communication and Engagement; Resource Management; and Student and Employee Wellness, Growth & Success. Equity encompasses twelve of the Plan's forty-four SMART goals; the plan states that the Kirkwood School District is \\"committed to equity.\\" Allegations of sexual abuse, permissive district culture In July 2020, multiple allegations began to surface on social media of alleged sexual abuse of students by Kirkwood High School and other district personnel dating back to at least the 1990s. Allegations came from more than a dozen former Kirkwood High School students. It was also alleged that the Kirkwood School District failed to take appropriate measures to address the incidents and prevent recurrences. Criminal investigations into at least two alleged abusers were begun. In August 2020, the district's board of education approved the hiring of the Kansas City firm Encompass Resolution, LLC to analyze and make recommendations about the district's climate related to the reporting and handling of sexual abuse allegations. Survivors of the alleged abuse expressed concern that the firm's focus is on enacting solutions to address workplace disputes and not on improving school climate related to sexual abuse. On September 9, 2020, a federal lawsuit was filed against the district and a former employee of the high school. The lawsuit alleges federal civil rights and Title IX violations and estimates that more than 25 district employees have been involved in sexual harassment, abuse, or discrimination against students over the previous 40 years. The suit also alleges that the former high school employee named as a defendant committed sexual assault and battery, although no criminal charges have been filed. The plaintiff's attorney states that the broad goal of the lawsuit is to prevent recurrences of sexually inappropriate behavior by district employees. On September 28, 2020, a former high school teacher (but not the former employee named as a defendant in the September 9 lawsuit) was arrested on five counts of statutory rape and numerous counts of statutory sodomy. He was indicted on October 1. Court documents state the abuse allegedly occurred within the high school building. The teacher had been accused of abuse before. In 1998, the district had allowed him to resign after two high school students separately reported abuse to the school's principal, and the resignation agreement stipulated that no charges be filed, no internal hearing take place, and no board inquiries be pursued. In addition, during the summer of 2020, numerous students had reported to a news outlet their experiences of grooming and abuse by the former employee, with reports to school leaders being made and nothing being done. The case is being handled by the St. Charles County prosecutor's office because of a conflict of interest in the prosecutor's office of the district's county, St. Louis.

The first, Thomas Veale, was known for legends of his buried treasure. The second Veale attacked ships along New England from Virginia to Boston with pirate John Graham. Thomas Veale‚Äôs Buried Treasure Thomas Veale (or Veal) and three other pirates sailed up the Saugus River in the middle of the 17th century. They were seen carrying a chest but disappeared after purchasing digging tools and other supplies from the locals. They built a shelter and brought a woman with them, supposedly a bride to one of the pirates, but she took ill and died soon after. The authorities raided the pirate camp and arrested three of them, sending them back to England to be hanged. The fourth, Veale, hid in a nearby cave where he lived for a time, occasionally working as a cordwainer. When a large earthquake struck the area in 1658 the cave collapsed, killing Veale and burying his treasure with him. The area (near Lynn, Massachusetts) was known as Pirates‚Äô Rock and later Dungeon Rock. Hiram Marble and his son purchased the land in 1852 and spent decades trying to find Veale‚Äôs treasure. They began charging for cave tours to help finance their dig but eventually gave up, unsuccessful. The area has been restored and is now accessible to tourists. Graham and Veale off New England Merchant Captain John Prentice sailed into the harbor at New London, Connecticut in 1685, anchoring alongside a sloop commanded by Captain Veale. In town Veale and his cargo master were seen attempting to buy cannons, offering enormous sums for them. A merchant captain from Pennsylvania who'd been attacked by Veale near Virginia recognized him and contacted officials. Veale and his crew quickly put to sea and fled. Prentice left for Boston soon after, spotting a small boat shuttling between Veale‚Äôs sloop and a nearby 14-man shallop. Prentice recognized the shallop's commander as John Graham. Veale chased Prentice, engaging in an hour-long running battle. Prentice escaped when a thunderstorm allowed him to put distance between his ship and Veale's. Prentice docked in Boston and alerted town officials that Veale and Greham were in the area. Boston magistrates commissioned Samson Waters as a privateer, authorizing him to raise a militia and take a barque to capture the pirates. Few locals signed up until magistrates offered a share of plunder if the pirates were captured, and revealed that a sailor had seen silver, furs, and other treasures aboard Veale's sloop. Waters sailed but Graham and Veale had already departed the area. He was sent out again in 1686 when Veale and Graham were reported in the area but was once more unsuccessful.

His book Barbarous Mexico helped discredit Mexican President Porfirio Diaz's regime in the eyes of the American public.  Early life  Turner was born in Portland, Oregon. His father was a printer at the Portland Oregonian. In 1880, the family operated a printing shop in Stockton, California, where Turner spent his youth and learned the printing business. His grandfather was a Methodist minister who had migrated from Kentucky to Oregon on the Oregon Trail in 1849. At 16, Turner began to develop an interest in socialism and at 17, published the weekly paper \\"Stockton Saturday Night,\\" which concerned itself with uncovering corruption among politicians and businessmen. He studied at the University of California, where he met Ethel Evelyn Duffy when he was 25. Duffy was an 18-year-old English major who was also inclined toward socialism. They married in 1905, left the college and settled in San Francisco. Turner was hired as a stringer for the Fresno Republican. After losing their apartment in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the couple spent a brief period in Portland, Oregon. He edited sports at the Portland Journal before moving to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, Turner worked as a reporter for the Los Angeles Herald.  Career  = Writing Barbarous Mexico = Photographs illustrated Barbarous Mexico. They used to have sensational captions describing slavery in Mexico. In Los Angeles, Turner met the Socialist Party leaders Job Harriman and John Murray. They introduced him to Mexican anarcho-syndicalist leaders Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n, Librado Rivera, Manuel Sarabia, and Antonio Villareal in April 1908. They were clients of Harriman's and accused of violating neutral laws of the United States to plan a revolution in Mexico. In an interview, they told Turner about the exploitation and slavery in Diaz's regime. The interview with the Mexican anarcho-syndicalists caused a movement among American radicals to free the prisoners in Los Angeles County Jail. The encounter with them was also the starting point for Turner's book Barbarous Mexico. From 1908 to 1911, the Turners were involved in Mexico's revolutionary movement, and Barbarous Mexico, criticizing the corruption and brutal labor system under Diaz, played a role in accelerating it. Turner posed undercover as a tobacco buyer for a New York firm, following the trend in undercover reporting Elizabeth Cochrane started. The wealthy Bostonian Elizabeth Darling Trowbridge sponsored his travel. Mexican lawyer L√°zaro Guti√©rrez de Lara assisted him. Turner joined Ethel in Tucson, Arizona. He prepared Mexico stories there. He got a contract with American Magazine to serialize his story. Its editor John Sanborn Phillips sent him back to Mexico to investigate the Mexican government's role in the peonage system. Turner worked as a sportswriter in the English-language newspaper Mexico Herald to continue his undercover report. In October 1909, the first installment of Barbarous Mexico was released. In his writings about Mexico, Turner appealed to emotions, and he was criticized for sensationalism and a lack of facts. The Porfirian regime discredited Barbarous Mexico in Mexican and American media. Among the owners of the press that criticized Turner's report were people who invested in Mexico and owned properties there, such as William Randolph Hearst of the liberal magazine Cosmopolitan. Diaz's supporters pushed American Magazine to drop the report. Barbarous Mexico returned in the media through the socialist weekly Appeal to Reason. The newspaper published six articles from the book and other related articles by Turner. = Collaboration with the Mexican Liberal Party = Together with WFM Mexican miners, Turner welcomed Flores Mag√≥n and his followers when they were released from prison in Florence, Arizona, in August 1910. They escorted the Mexican revolutionaries due to fear of an ambush by the Mexican government. At this point, Turner adopted an active role in the revolutionary movement. He directed the crowd and announced that \\"only an armed revolution\\" could solve Mexico's problems. He collaborated for the newspaper Regeneraci√≥n of the Mexican Liberal Party, led by Flores Mag√≥n. Meanwhile, his wife Ethel edited the English version of the paper. Turner also helped to get weapons for the revolutionaries of the Mexican Liberal Party. At the end of January, he shipped 60 rifles, a few revolvers, and 9,000 rounds of ammunition by rail to a California farmer who sent them to Mexico as ‚Äúfarm machinery‚Äù. During this period, Turner withdrew from journalism. Turner questioned the Magonists' tactics, and was disappointed in the Flores Mag√≥n brothers' decision to reject the Mexican liberal President Francisco I. Madero. At the end of 1912, Turner returned to Mexico and collaborated with El Pa√≠s in Mexico City. He met with Madero and received a letter to get any data he requested. But Victoriano Huerta deposed Madero hours after Turner's article appeared. Turner shot photos of Huerta's coup d'etat, but he was arrested. He claimed he was tortured and awaiting execution, but Secretary of State Philander Knox declared that Turner was never endangered. = War correspondent = From 1912, the family lived in Carmel-by-the-Sea, where poet George Sterling let them take over his house. Turner wrote articles for the socialist newspapers the New York Call and Appeal to Reason and other periodicals, covering the labor wars in American coalfields. He posed as a New York magazine writer and exchanged liquor for information with mine guards and militia officers. He traveled to research gunmen corporations hired to stop strikes and labor unions. In 1915, Turner traveled to Mexico to report on the American occupation of Veracruz and got an exclusive interview with Venustiano Carranza, one of the constitutionalist revolutionaries' key leaders. He traveled to Mexico again the next year to report on the Pancho Villa Punitive Expedition. As the guest of progressive Republican senator from Wisconsin Robert M. La Follette, Turner was present for President Woodrow Wilson's speech to Congress requesting a declaration of war on Germany. He opposed U.S. participation in the war and in 1922 published Shall It Be Again?, a book criticizing the war and America's involvement, which was cited by, among others, former German Kaiser Wilhelm II in his memoirs on the question of war guilt. After the war, as the prospect of yet another American intervention in Mexico arose, the Rand School of Social Science published his book Hands Off Mexico. In 1921, Turner interviewed the Zapatista general Genovevo de la O in Cuernavaca.  Later life  Political developments in the 1920s and 1930s discouraged Turner and he ceased his writing and political activities. He and Ethel separated in 1925 and he later married socialist writer Adriana Spadoni. In 1941, he published his last book, Challenge to Karl Marx. He died in 1948. He was the brother of United States Navy Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner.

Jugoviƒá was included in the SPO's parliamentary delegation.11 June 2008 legislature, National Assembly of Serbia, accessed 23 August 2017. In October 2008, Jugoviƒá described the SPO as \\"the pillar that rallies the intellectual and pro-European [Union], responsible right wing\\" in Serbia, placing it in the ideological tradition of figures such as Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle.He made these remarks in the context of criticizing the Serbian Progressive Party, which had just been formed as a breakaway group from the Serbian Radical Party. See \\"'Interesting' poll conducted by US agency 'shows' most popular Serbian parties,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 31 October 2008 (Source: Glas javnosti, Belgrade, in Serbian 30 Oct 08, p3). Three years later, he argued that Serbia should not celebrate July 7 as Uprising Day; his contention was that the Yugoslav partisan uprising on that date in World War II was motivated by communist ideology rather than opposition to the Axis occupation of Serbia.\\"Jugoviƒá: Srbija ne sme da slavi 7. jul\\", Blic (Source: Tanjug), 7 July 2011, accessed 23 August 2017. In September 2009, Jugoviƒá proposed a decentralization strategy for Serbia that, among other things, would have divided Vojvodina into three regions.\\"Serbian party proposes decentralization of Vojvodina into three regions,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 19 September 2009 (Source: Dnevnik website, Novi Sad, in Serbian 17 Sep 09).

He called for changes to the Constitution of Serbia in 2015, saying that the number of deputies in the assembly needed to be reduced and the manner of election changed.

The film stars Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman and Chris Hemsworth. Set in 1969, the plot follows seven strangers each hiding dark secrets, who come together one night in a shady hotel on the California-Nevada border. Bad Times at the El Royale premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 27, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 12, 2018. Although a box office average, grossing $31 million worldwide against its $32 million budget, it received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with praise for its acting and Goddard's direction, but criticism for the runtime and pacing. Plot In 1959 a man hides a bag of money under the floorboards of a hotel room, but afterward, another man arrives and kills him. Ten years later, Catholic priest Daniel Flynn, singer Darlene Sweet, salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, and hippie Emily Summerspring arrive at the El Royale hotel that straddles the California-Nevada border, popular with the wealthy until losing its gambling license. They meet the hotel's only remaining employee, Miles Miller. Upon checking into the honeymoon suite, Sullivan begins removing wiretaps but unexpectedly finds a second set as well. He then discovers a secret corridor from which guest's rooms can be observed via two-way mirrors and filmed with a movie camera. From the corridor, Sullivan sees Emily committing an apparent kidnapping. He calls into the FBI, where he identifies as Special Agent Dwight Broadbeck. J. Edgar Hoover instructs him to ignore the kidnapping, and prevent the guests from leaving until the FBI materials are secured, so Dwight disables all the cars. Flynn invites Sweet to join him for dinner. She sees him spiking her drink and knocks him unconscious with a bottle. Miller finds and revives Flynn, then shows him the secret passageway, explaining that \\"management\\" regularly had him film guests' intimate encounters, and send the footage to them. Miller admits having withheld one incriminating film of a deceased public figure who had been kind to him. When Flynn leaves to evaluate the film, Miller witnesses through the two-way mirror Agent Broadbeck attempting to rescue Emily's hostage, who is revealed to be Emily's younger sister, Rose. Emily kills Broadbeck with a shotgun, which also shoots out the mirror and brutalizes half of Miller's face. Emily had forcibly removed her sister from a murderous cult in California led by Billy Lee, in order to keep her until she is ‚Äúclear.‚Äù Billy is a lecherous, sadistic, and charismatic leader, and during the failed rescue Rose is able to call Billy to tell him where she is. Sweet, who has witnessed Broadbeck's murder from the parking lot, attempts to escape, but her car won‚Äôt start. Flynn arrives and reveals to her that he is Dock O'Kelly, imprisoned since the robbery in 1959. Recently paroled, he came here in disguise to retrieve the money hidden by his brother. Due to O'Kelly's failing memory, he picked the wrong room, and the money was not there. Believing it to be in Sweet's room, he had attempted to drug her simply to gain access. Withholding knowledge that he is in possession of the film, O'Kelly offers to split the cash with Sweet. O'Kelly pulls up the floor of Sweet‚Äôs room, as she sings and claps to cover the noise, as Emily watches them through the mirror. As O'Kelly and Sweet attempt to leave with the money, Lee and his cult arrive and take them, Emily, and Miller hostage. Lee finds the money and the film, which he realizes is worth more than the money. Beginning to terrorize the group, Lee kills Emily by playing a life-or-death game of roulette between her and Miller. Before Lee completes another roulette round between O'Kelly and Sweet, O'Kelly attacks Lee and a melee ensues. When Sweet implores Miller to pick up a gun and help, he reveals that he served in Vietnam as a sniper and killed 123 people. A defiant Miller kills Lee and his followers to save O'Kelly. A distraught Rose stabs Miller and is shot by O'Kelly. Before Miller dies, Sweet tells \\"Father Flynn\\" to absolve Miller of the guilt over his actions in Vietnam. O'Kelly complies. O'Kelly and Sweet retrieve the money, Sweet tosses the film into the fire, and the pair leave. Sometime later in Reno, O'Kelly attends Sweet's jazz performance at a nightclub. The two smile warmly at each other before she begins to sing.  Cast   Production  On March 8, 2017, it was announced that 20th Century Fox had bought the spec script Bad Times at the El Royale, written by Drew Goddard, who would also direct and produce the film. On August 23, 2017, Chris Hemsworth and Jeff Bridges were cast in the 1960s-set film, to play two among the several characters who collide at the El Royale hotel, near California's Lake Tahoe. That same day, it was also reported that Tom Holland had passed on a role, and that Beyonc√© was being courted for the role of a black vocalist. It was also revealed that main roles in the ensemble would include a vacuum cleaner salesman, two female criminals, a male cult leader, and a desk clerk. Later in August 2017, newcomer Cailee Spaeny was added to the cast to play an impressionable Southern girl brought to the hotel, while Cynthia Erivo was cast as the black singer who finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. In January 2018, Dakota Johnson and Russell Crowe joined the cast (though Crowe did not appear in the film). In February 2018, Jon Hamm, Nick Offerman, and Mark O'Brien joined the cast, and in May 2018, Lewis Pullman was also confirmed for a role. Principal photography on the film began on January 29, 2018 in Vancouver, British Columbia. In February, it was being shot in Burnaby. The El Royale is quite similar in appearance and characteristics to the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, closed in 2013. =Music= The score for Bad Times at the El Royale was composed by Michael Giacchino over August 15‚Äì16, 2018 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox Studios. The score was released, as a Digital Download and CD, by Milan Records on October 12, 2018. A separate soundtrack edition, featuring songs from the movie was digitally released by Republic Records, without a physical CD release. Director Goddard described the movie as \\"a love letter to music\\", and considered the original songs as \\"reflect[ing] the smoky film noir spirit\\" of the movie, the soundtrack assembles jazz, doo wop and fifties and sixties staples as its period songs by artists including The Four Preps, Edwin Starr, Frankie Valli, The Crystals, The Mamas & The Papas, Four Tops, The American Breed, Deep Purple & more. The digital version of the soundtrack was later updated to include two of the songs performed in the movie by Cynthia Erivo: \\"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\\" and \\"Hold On, I'm Coming\\". Although not included on the soundtrack, Erivo also performed the songs \\"Try A Little Tenderness\\", \\"What Becomes of the Broken Hearted\\" and \\"Unchained Melody\\". Director Goddard also self-penned a song for Erivo to perform, titled \\"Hold Me In Your Arms, Lift Me On High\\". Erivo was required to sing on camera in real- time, with no option to use pre-recorded vocals: \\"Every time you see me sing in a room, wherever, it‚Äôs happening in that room and I‚Äôm singing for real\\", Erivo explained later. For the long scene where Laramie discovers the secret passageway, retakes and resets for different camera angles required Erivo to perform twenty-seven times, while the later scene where Darlene is singing to cover the noise Doc makes while digging was shot twenty times.  Release  The first trailer was released on June 7, 2018. The film had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest on September 27, 2018 and also screened at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival. It was theatrically released in the United States on October 12, 2018. The film received a digital release on December 18, 2018, and received a 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD release on January 1, 2019. Reception =Box office= Bad Times at the El Royale grossed $17.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $14.0 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $31.8 million, against a production budget of $32 million. In the United States and Canada, Bad Times at the El Royale was released alongside First Man and Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween, and was projected to gross $8‚Äì12 million from 2,808 theaters in its opening weekend, with some predictions going as high as $17 million. The film made $2.8 million on its first day and went on to debut to $7.2 million, finishing seventh at the box office. Deadline Hollywood speculates the film was hurt by its 141-minute runtime, as well as its niche genre and lack of awards buzz. The film dropped 52% in its second weekend to $3.4 million, finishing ninth. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 248 reviews, with an average rating of 6.70/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Smart, stylish, and packed with solid performances, Bad Times at the El Royale delivers pure popcorn fun with the salty tang of social subtext.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Randy Cordova, in a review for the Arizona Republic, wrote \\"El Royale feels like a Quentin Tarantino film, even though it‚Äôs not. It boasts a lot of the director's signature touches: There are jarring bursts of graphic violence, a retro soundtrack and title cards throughout. Plus, like a lot of Tarantino films, it runs about 30 minutes too long. But hey, if you‚Äôre going to pay homage, there are worse ways to go.\\"  References   External links   * * Category:2018 films Category:2010s mystery thriller films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American mystery thriller films Category:English-language films Category:American neo-noir films Category:American nonlinear narrative films Category:Films about death Category:Films about murder Category:Films directed by Drew Goddard Category:Films scored by Michael Giacchino Category:Films set in 1959 Category:Films set in 1969 Category:Films set in California Category:Films set in hotels Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Films with screenplays by Drew Goddard ","title":"Bad Times at the El Royale"},{"id":"55011612","text":"Bill Hardgrave is an American academic.

It marked a change in Ligier's priorities as they had recently ended manufacture of the Ligier JS2 sports car. It is a \\"Voiture sans permis\\", a light vehicle which did not require a driver's license and was thus popular with the elderly, the young, or with those who had lost theirs. It was first presented on 25 July 1980.  Design  After abandoning the field of sports car manufacture Ligier briefly submanufactured tractor cabins for Renault V.I., beginning in 1978. The JS4 was designed using one of these cabins. It was a steel monococque with a short wheelbase and (comparatively) wide track. It was square rigged with large, flat glass surfaces and a glazed rear door, and unusually fat tires. It had independent suspension on all four wheels, drum brakes all around, and rack-and-pinion steering. The single- cylinder engine is mounted at the rear, below the luggage compartment, and produces and powers the rear wheels through a continuously variable transmission. The JS4, with its pleasant appearance and Formula One heritage, proved a strong seller. 6941 were sold in 1981, its first full year of production, a very good number for a voiturette. The Ligier Formula One team used an example painted in the team colors as a pit vehicle, that example currently resides in the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. In late 1981 the lineup had been divided into the JS4 Standard, Luxe, and Grand Luxe, with corresponding equipment and trim. Soon, however, quality issues began to pop up. The steel body, while strong, was heavy and led to drive axles failing, and exposed a weak transmission. The steel body also rusted, something that was not a problem with the mostly plastic-bodied competition. =Facelifts= 1987 Ligier JS6; here an electrified version developed by City Wheels Limited for an early carsharing scheme In 1982 the more expensive JS8 model appeared, mostly the same as the JS4 but equipped with a 125 cc engine. In 1984, the JS4 was replaced by the similar JS6, which has a more rounded front, with a faux grille in black plastic. By 1985, the Motob√©cane engine had been replaced by 49 or 125 cc Derbi units, or a 327 cc Ducati-VM diesel. The design was later developed into the 330 and 430 versions. There was also a longer truck version, called the 330 U.

History The Lagos State Refuse Disposal Board (LSRDB) was instituted under Edict No. 9 of 1977, which was the first of its kind in West Africa. The Board was given the responsibilities of environmental sanitation and domestic refuse collection and disposal in Lagos State. The Board was renamed the Lagos State Waste Management Authority via the enactment of a new Law ‚Äì Edict No. 55 of 1991, which conferred on the Authority additional responsibilities for the collection and disposal of municipal and industrial wastes as well as provision of commercial waste services to the State and Local Governments of Lagos State. The Board metamorphosed over the years into the agency known today as the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) by virtue of the LAWMA Law 2007, and accrued added responsibilities ranging from management of commercial, industrial, and medical waste streams, highway sanitation, cleaning of drainage and other water bodies, to construction and demolition waste management, among others. LAWMA works closely with the Lagos State Ministry of Environment and has initiated reforms regarding collection of waste bills and also aims to increase Waste recycling. In 2011, GMI awarded a grant to the LAWMA for studies evaluating the feasibility of capturing landfill gas from the Abule Egba and Solous Landfills. Based on their findings, LAWMA developed a landfill gas energy project to avail the local residents a reliable source of electricity.

Six peptides of this group (SHLP1‚Äì6) have been identified so far, each peptide is of 20-38 amino-acid long. They are derived from the mitochondria and act as important retrograde signaling molecules in the cell. Their names were given because the SHLPs share some similar biological effects with the mitochondrial peptide Humanin. Every individual SHLP showed unique expression pattern in mouse tissues. Specifically, SHLP1 was detected in the heart, kidney, and spleen; SHLP2 was detected in the liver, kidney, and muscle; SHLP3 was detected in the brain and spleen; SHLP4 was detected in the liver and prostate; and SHLP6 was detected in the liver and kidney. Experiments using cultured mammalian cells have shown that SHLPs are bioactive peptides. Incubation of each synthetic SHLP with cells affected cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis differentially, which suggests that every SHLP may play a different role in the biological system.  Discovery  An in silico search for potential small open-reading-frames (sORFs) within 16S ribosomal RNA-encoding short peptides (20‚Äì40 amino acids) was conducted in the Pinchas Cohen lab at University of Southern California. Six sequences encoding 20‚Äì38 amino-acid-long peptides were identified, which were named SHLP 1‚Äì6. The endogenous SHLPs were detected by immunoblots and their transcripts were validated by both qPCR and northern blot.  Functions  Individual SHLPs demonstrated different biological effects. SHLP2 and SHLP3 enhanced cell viability and inhibited apoptosis in both NIT-1 and 22Rv1 cells. SHLP2 and SHLP4 promoted cell proliferation in NIT-1 Œ≤-cells. SHLP6 significantly increased apoptosis in both NIT-1 and 22Rv1 cells, having an effect opposite of SHLP2 and SHLP3. Moreover, SHLP2 and SHLP3 also induced oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and increased cellular ATP levels, which indicates that SHLP2 and 3 are mitochondrial modulators.

The main library is situated within the Quezon City Hall complex while the library also maintain smaller branches within the city. History =Early years= First inaugurated on August 16, 1948, the library initially operated in a one-storey building next to the old Post Office building at the back of the Old Quezon City Hall along then-named Highway 54 (now Epifanio De los Santos Avenue). The initial collection of the library consisted of 4,000 book volumes donated by the National Library of the Philippines. =Expansion and main library transfers= In response to the growing population of the city, a branch of the library was opened in the Project 3 area in 1953 under the administration of then Mayor Ignacio Santos- Diaz. The following year, 8 additional branches were opened in different districts of the city. The Main Library transferred in 1957 to the Old City Hall Building where it occupied a more spacious space. Within the same year, City Ordinance No. 3559 was approved by the Quezon City Council approved which defined the powers and duties of the library's librarian and superintendent. The main library vacated the old city hall building and moved to the Lion's International Building at Bernardo Park which stands in an area donated by the Lion's International to the city government. The main library moved to the New Quezon City Hall Building's ground floor where it operated for ten years before transferring to a dedicated building. An inauguration ceremony held on August 6, 1984 by Pacencia J. Buendia, former City Superintendent of Libraries, was held to mark the move. The number of branches of the library grew to 21 by late 2016. This figure includes the main library. The main library re-opened once again in February 2017 in a newly built three-story building also located within the city hall compound. Main Library The Main Library's location has moved or reassigned for several times throughout the history of the Quezon City Public Library. The library is currently housed within a three-story building within the Quezon City Hall Complex which was inaugurated and opened by Mayor Herbert Bautista along with City Librarian Emelita Villanueva on February 6, 2017. The building for the main library has been planned since 2010. The library building's facilities includes a cafe, a children's corner, a function room, and a puppeteer's room. Computers are also available for public use. The first floor of the building hosts the reference section, Filipiniana section, periodicals, archives and materials on local history. Resources on law research, extension library services, technical service, district libraries and inventory, and multi-media are offered on the library's second floor.

Intermedia was a loose association of Vancouver artists who worked in a variety of media, collaborated on and staged events. It was founded in 1967 by Jack Shadbolt and Glenn Lewis, among others. At the time of its inception Intermedia aimed to create a centre of community resource in Vancouver where artists, architects, engineers, technologists and educators could come together and explore new models and formats for the purpose of intensifying and expanding the effectiveness of creative sensibility in the community. As time passed the aims of the group changed to focus on individual artists and small groups: > The purpose/aim of Intermedia is to help the artist realize [their self] and > [their] work by providing an umbrella/shelter of cooperatively-structured, > contiguous and inter-related functioning artists' groups, often service- > oriented.

The tandem of Villaluna-Ramos also co- wrote and co-edited the film. It was selected in the main competition of the 20th Shanghai International Film Festival where it won the Golden Goblet for Best in Feature Film. Its win makes Pedicab (Pauwi Na) only the 4th full- feature film in the history of Philippine cinema to ever win the top prize in an A-list international film festival. It has an ensemble cast led by Philippine icons Bembol Roco and Cherry Pie Picache. Plot Inspired by a news article featured in the Philippine Daily Inquirer (‚ÄúFamily pedals way back home to Leyte,‚Äù Sept. 7, 2003), Pauwi Na (PEDICAB) follows Mang Pepe and his family as they pedal on pedicabs (cycle rickshaws) the thousands of miles from Manila to the farmlands. The ailing Mang Pepe (Bembol Roco), his wife, Remedios (Cherry Pie Picache), their daughter Pina (Chai Fonacier), their son JP (Jerald Napoles), his wife Isabel (Meryll Soriano) and their dog Kikay live together in a shanty in the slums. Survival is hand-to-mouth. Mang Pepe drives his rusting pedicab to deliver goods to the market. Aling Remedios washes laundry for her neighbors. JP steals, Pina sells cigarettes, and Isabel, blind and soon to give birth, believes she can see and speak to Jesus Christ. Mang Pepe convinces the family that life will be better farming in their home province. Without the money to pay for bus fare or the means to survive on the road, the family piles into a pair of pedicabs, determined to pedal their way home. Casting The film is an ensemble piece and stars Bembol Roco, Cherry Pie Picache, Meryll Soriano, Jerald Napoles, Jess Mendoza and Chai Fonacier. Villaluna said that he thinks the reason why it took so long for the film to be produced was because he was waiting for the perfect cast, and that Bembol and Cherry Pie ‚Äúwere destined‚Äù to be in the film. This was also Cherry Pie‚Äôs break from cinematic hybernation after the film Isda (2014, Adolfo Alix Jr.) because ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt find anything interesting until I got the script from Paolo.

According to Villaluna, the script has been written since 2006 together with Ellen Ramos. It went through several commercial studios but demands of a happier ending made Villaluna-Ramos decide to shelf it. After the script was accepted in 2016 to a local grant-giving film festival, ToFarm Film Festival, the filmmakers decided to pursue the production. It is executive produced by Dr. Milagros O. How, the patron of the ToFarm Film Festival. Release It was first screened in August 2016 as part of the week-long local competitive Tofarm Film Festival. It was widely reviewed as the one of the best in the festival and eventually won the Special Jury Prize, Best Acting nods for both Bembol Roco and Cherry Pie Picache, Best Story, Best Editing and Best Production Design.

Background  Upper Silesia with its mixed Polish and German population was a province of Prussia and a part of the German Reich prior to World War I. In the Treaty of Versailles, after the defeat of Imperial Germany and Austria- Hungary in World War I, it was decided that the population of Upper Silesia should hold a plebiscite to determine the division of the province between Poland and Germany, with the exception of a area around Hluƒç√≠n (Hultschiner L√§ndchen), which was granted to Czechoslovakia in 1920 despite its German- speaking majority. The plebiscite, organised by the League of Nations, was held in 1921. In Teschen Silesia there was an interim deal between the Polish and Czechoslovakian local self-government councils about the partition of past lands of the Duchy of Teschen along ethnic lines. However, that deal was not approved by the Czechoslovak government in Prague. Poland held elections in the entire disputed area, and in the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War Czech troops invaded the lands of Teschen Silesia on 23 January 1919, stopping on 30 January 1919 on the Weichsel River near Skotschau.D≈Çugajczyk, Tajny front na granicy cieszy≈Ñskiej. Wywiad i dywersja w latach 1919‚Äì1939, 1993, p. 7.Zahradnik, Korzenie Zaolzia, 1992, p. 59. The planned plebiscite was not organised in the Teschen region but was held in most other parts of Upper Silesia. On 28 July 1920, the Spa Conference divided Teschen Silesia between Poland and Czechoslovakia along the present-day border.  Upper Silesia Plebiscite  In 1918 various proposals emerged defining the division of Upper Silesia. At the Paris Peace Conference a commission for Polish affairs was created to prepare proposals for Polish borders. In their first two proposals (of 27 March 1919 and of 7 May 1919) most of the future province was ceded, together with the region of Oppeln, to Poland. Yet that was not accepted by the Big Four, and following David Lloyd George's suggestion, a plebiscite was organized. Before it took place on 20 March 1921, two Silesian Insurrections instigated by Polish inhabitants of the area were organized. After the referendum, in which Poland had 41% of the votes, a plan of the division was created that divided Upper Silesia.Upper Silesia Plebiscite: A Brief History This led to a new phase of the Silesian Uprisings, the so-called Third Silesian Uprising and the Battle of Annaberg. The result of the 1921 referendum was legally not binding and ignored. A new partition plan was prepared by the League of Nations and adopted by the Conference of Ambassadors (the successor to the Supreme Council of the Principal Allied Powers) on 20 October 1921. This plan was due to enter into effect by 20 June 1922, but it still created a situation in which some rural territories that voted mostly for Poland were granted to Germany and some urban territories with a German majority were granted to Poland.  Geneva Convention of 15 May 1922  In 1921 the Geneva conference for regulating conditions in Upper Silesia took place under the chairmanship of Felix Calonder, then a member of the Swiss Federal Council. The conference's aim was to alleviate the economic consequences of the partition of this highly industrialized region and to guarantee the rights of minorities in both Polish and German Upper Silesia.* Georges Kaeckenbeeck, The International Experiment of Upper Silesia. Oxford University Press, 1942.  Consequences  On 20 June 1922, the division according to the plan of the Conference of the Ambassadors became effective. The German Reich had to accept the loss of its coal-bearing land and was left with the economically unimportant West Upper Silesia. The Silesian coal was highly relevant to the German economy during that time. The major part of Silesia remaining in Germany, was reorganised into the two provinces of Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia. The Polish Sejm decided that the easternmost Upper Silesian areas should become an autonomous area within Poland organised as the Silesian Voivodeship and with Silesian Parliament as a constituency and Silesian Voivodeship Council as the executive body. A central political figure was Wojciech Korfanty. The part of Silesia awarded to Poland was by far the best-developed and richest region of the newly formed state, producing most of Poland's industrial output.  Mixed Commission and Arbitral Tribunal  The Upper Silesian Mixed Commission (or \\"Mixed Commission for Upper Silesia\\"), composed of an equal number of Polish and German delegates and headed by a neutral president, the Swiss Felix Calonder, was set up as a quasi-judicial body to arbitrate disputes for a 15-year interim period ending in 1937. The Mixed Commission was headquartered in Polish held Katowice. The Upper Silesian Arbitral Tribunal (or \\"Arbitral Tribunal for Upper Silesia\\"), headquartered in German-held Bytom and presided over by the Belgian international lawyer Georges Kaeckenbeeck, also played an adjudicating role.Erpelding, Michel. \\"Upper Silesian Mixed Commission.\\" Max Planck Institute Luxembourg, 2017.Erpelding, Michel. \\"Local International Adjudication: The Groundbreaking ‚ÄòExperiment‚Äô of the Arbitral Tribunal for Upper Silesia\\" In: M.

The two-state parties, made little use of the commission, making only 18 complaints over the years. However, the commission's president Calonder, who was active in protecting minority rights, handled more than 3,400 minority right cases by individuals and groups. While Calonder's opinions were non-binding on the contracting states and were not always followed, they did have an effect. In particular, the Bernheim petition led to the suspension of anti-Jewish legislation in German Upper Silesia until 1937. Individuals also made wide use of the Arbitral Tribunal which solved more than 4,000 cases.

Description  = History = The museum is the brainchild of the entrepreneur and contemporary art collector Giulio Bargellini, who in 2000 decided to open a space where he could share his passions with the general public. The museum displays over 2,000 works of contemporary art distributed throughout 9,000 square metres and it is housed in a singular building ‚Äì a barn silo of the 1930s. Thanks to a project of the architect Giuseppe Davanzo, the silo was converted into a museum, to which two new exhibition spaces and a big garden dedicated to sculpture were added later on. = The Collection = The vast, diverse and high-quality collection takes visitors on a surprising journey through the Italian and international art of the last century. His eclectic taste and the friendships that the founder built with the artists, his passions and intuitions and a constant expositive and proactive activity brought to the constitution of a wide permanent collection, which includes many movements: from the Belle √âpoque to the most recent tendecies, from the lively futuristic colours to the metaphysical bronze sculptures by Giorgio de Chirico, from the Maestri Storici del Novecento to the avant-garde of the 1960s and 1970s, from hundreds of miniature paintings of the Collezione Minima 8x10, once belonged to Cesare Zavattini, to the production of African and Sudamerican artists. The Museo MAGI ‚Äò900 hosts numerous well-known and historicized artists as well as less-known ones, whose professionality and originality is praised, in an exhibition space separated into thematic sections, which makes it stand out from the common contemporary museum environment. Among the artists whose works appear in the museum are: { - valign=\\"top\\"  style=\\"padding-right  * Donald Baechler * Massimo Baistrocchi * Afro Basaldella * Renato Birolli * Giovanni Boldini * Aroldo Bonzagni * Alberto Burri * Massimo Campigli * Giuseppe Capogrossi * Carlo Carr√† * Felice Casorati * Bruno Cassinari * Antonio Corpora  * Claudio Costa * Giorgio de Chirico * Raffaele De Grada * Fortunato Depero * Gerardo Dottori * Lucio Fontana * Franco Gentilini * Giuseppe Guerreschi * Virgilio Guidi * Renato Guttuso * Damien Hirst * Paul Jenkins * Carlo Levi  * Sol LeWitt * Antonio Ligabue * Leo Lionni * Mario Mafai * Alberto Magnelli * Esther Mahlangu * Francesco Menzio * Amedeo Modigliani * Ennio Morlotti * Dennis Oppenheim * Fausto Pirandello * Arnaldo Pomodoro * Gi√≤ Pomodoro  * Enrico Prampolini * Aligi Sassu * Alberto Savinio * Emilio Scanavino * Gino Severini * Mario Sironi * Philip Taaffe * Mario Tozzi * Emilio Vedova * Renato Vernizzi * Tom Wesselmann * Zoran Music } The visit winds through shapes, materials, colours, themes and poetics which change from section to section, offering an immersion in the visual arts. = The Services = The permanent and the temporary collections can be visited by paying an entrance fee except for the OPEN BOX space, where there are always exhibitions and cultural events available for free. The museum organizes individual, thematic or personalized guided tours and offers laboratories for children as well as workshops for adults, which aim at making the participants understand art by practicing the most innovative techniques in order to offer a well-rounded experience to the public. The education department MAGICOMAGI offers a wide range of activities, from laboratories to animated visits for schools.

Early life Eugenia \\"Genie\\" Clark was born in Iowa City, Iowa, on April 27, 1867. Her father, Rush B. Clark (1834-1879), when a young man, was an Iowa pioneer. Both parents were college graduates. Her mother, Eugenia Orr (died April 27, 1867), was a teacher who died giving birth to Genie. A previous son, Eugene Rush Clark, had died during birth in 1865. Clark's father married again in a few years, and to this union several children were born, of which two lived. When Genie Clark was eleven years old she went to Washington, D.C., to be with her father during his second term in Congress. After his death in 1879, she returned to her former home and lived with her guardian at his country seat near Iowa City. Two years were afterward spent in Schellsburg, Pennsylvania, with relatives. At the age of fourteen she was sent to public schools in Iowa City for the University, from which, after the freshman year, she was sent to Callanan College in Des Moines, Iowa, where she studied two years. In 1890, she was among the founders of the Pacific Coast Women's Press Association. A large number of women journalists met on September 27, 1890, at Parkhurst's home at 1419 Tavlor Street, San Francisco, for the formation of the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association. Henry X. Clemont presided as temporary Chairman. Swett delivered an address, in which she set forth the objects of the association. Nellie B. Evster of San Francisco was unanimously elected president; Jeanne C. Carr of Pasadena, First Vice-President; Ella Rhoads Higginson of the Portland West, Shore, Second Vice-President, and Sarah B. Cooper, Third Vice-President. Swett was elected Corresponding Secretary; Mrs. Sam Davis, Recording Secretary; Mary O. Stanton, Treasurer, and Mrs. M. U. Field of San Jose, Auditor. The Executive Board was still further fortified by three members at large, Mrs. Hall-Wood of the Santa Barbara Independent; Andrea Hofer of the Salem Journal, and Frances Bagby of the San Diego Union. Career While living in Seattle Genie Clark Pomeroy for the first time made literature a matter of business as well as pleasure, contributing to, among other publications Washington Magazine, Woman's Journal (Boston), Pacific Christian Advocate, Time, West Shore, and other publications. Personal life While in Des Moines attending University, Genie Clark met Carl Harrington Pomeroy (1862 - September 27, 1923), the son of the president of the college. They married on June 30, 1886, and had one daughter, Delia Imogene Pomeroy. After their marriage Carl Pomeroy took the chair of history in the college, and Genie Clark Pomeroy remained as a pupil. Both afterward returned to Iowa City and entered school, the one in the post-graduate law department, and the other in the collegiate. In 1888 they moved to Seattle, Washington, and afterward to Hoquiam, Washington. In 1895 Carl Pomeroy married a second time.

Daverio attended the European School in Varese, and then studied economics and commerce at the Bocconi University in Milan.

This Long-Wheelbase version so far is only available in Chinese and Indian Markets. Standard wheelbase versions are referred to as W213, which are also available in the Chinese market. The E-Class V213 was launched at the 2016 Beijing Auto Show and went on sale in China in August the same year. It is very different from its predecessor, the facelifted V212, with a completely new chassis and interior. The V213 E-Class is often referred to as the ‚Äòsmaller S-Class‚Äô, mainly due to the many similarities they have including the shape of the c-pillar and so on. The car is 5,067 mm long, which makes it the longest E-Class ever made. The V213 E-Class is sold in 3 basic models, E200L, E300L and E320L, all of which can be selected between Exclusive line and AMG Line designs. The new 4-cylinder turbocharged M274 or M276 petrol engines are available, which are quick enough to get the E200L from 0-62 mph in 8.6s, E300L in 6.9s and E320L 4MATIC in a claimed 5.7s. This time the all new 9G-Tronic Transmission which focuses more on efficiency and smoother gear changes is standard across the whole range.  Public opinion  Since its launch, there have been some disappointment as well as admiration in China. The longer wheelbase and luxury equipment have made the new E-Class popularly recognized as the less expensive alternative to the S-Class. Another reason being that the design has taken inspiration from the Maybach S-Class. While some buyers are dissatisfied with the fact that some of the equipment like the multibeam headlights and several driving assistances, which are brand new features on this model, do not come as standard and are listed as \\"optional extras\\" (to pay for), others comment that the spacious cabin, new interior (all V213 E-Class have 12.3 inch displays) and luxurious features such as onboard Wi-Fi and wireless charging, and automatic emergency brakes as standard, which are items not available on the worldwide W213 E-Class contribute to the Long-Wheelbase's market success. The price difference between W213 and V213 E-Class in China is not significantly large, around only 10,000 RMB ($1,560), which makes the V213 E-Class even more attractive to buy.

This dune system is considered fairly unique because, as a result of the prevailing northwest winds, the sand from the Guincho and Cresmina beaches eventually returns to the sea 5km further to the south near Guia, after migrating over the flat, rocky and largely uninhabited area of Cabo Raso. Features The Guincho-Cresmina dunes are an unstable system due to the constant drifting of sand particles caused by strong winds. The existence of barriers to movement, such as restaurants and hotels, which narrowed the sand transportation corridors between beaches and dunes, and the tendency of the wind speed to be increasing, led to increased deposits of sediments in areas further away from the coastline, with a consequent reduction in the beach area and potential damage to neighbouring land and homes. Studies show that the Cresmina dune is advancing in a north-south direction by about 10 m per year. Fauna that find a home on the Cresmina Dune include Acanthodactylus erythrurus (Spiny-footed lizard), the White wagtail (Motacilla alba), the Sanderling (Calidris alba), the Common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula), and Vipera latastei (Lataste's Viper). Sand heading from Guincho beach on the left to Cresmina Dune on the right Rehabilitation Within the framework of the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park Visitation and Interpretation Network, the municipality of Cascais has been working since 2011 to rehabilitate dunes, in partnership with the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests. The work aims at providing maximum protection for the dunes by controlling pedestrian access and enabling local fauna and flora to recover from past damage caused by dogs, walkers, horse riders and cross-country vehicles. The dunes are now fully fenced. The work has also included the installation of natural regenerators, made using palisades of dead plant material. The placement of these structures is crucial to reduce the wind speed and thus contain the advance of the sand. Palisades in Cresmina Dune The Cresmina Dune Interpretation Centre provides informative panels on the walls of a refreshment bar. It aims to inform visitors of the unique fauna and flora associated with the Guincho-Cresmina dune system. Raised wooden walkways were installed to prevent people walking in the dunes. They are of close to 2km in length and enable visitors to see native plants that are only found in the area, together with the fauna and flora that form a delicate ecological balance with the dunes. Some damage was caused to the northern part of the walkway as a result of a forest fire in the Sintra- Cascais Park that burned over 600 hectares on 6 October 2018 but it was speedily repaired. Local vegetation recovery actions have also been implemented, namely through the removal of invasive species, such as the weeping Carpobrotus edulis, together with the planting of native species such as Ammophila arenaria (European Marram Grass), Armeria welwitschii (thrift), Juniperus turbinata (beach sabina), Pancratium maritimum, (sea daffodil) and Ononis ramosissima.

It was intended to start operating in 2028 between North Carolina Central University (NCCU) in eastern Durham and the UNC Medical Center in Orange County. This line was being developed by regional transit agency GoTriangle, and was in the engineering phase of the federal grant approval process when it was discontinued.  History  Chapel Hill and Durham are the home to major academic institutions and employers in the healthcare and service industries, and are the geographically closer of three cities in the Research Triangle region. Due to increasing traffic and development around the area, local governments and regional organizations conducted multiple studies to preserve and expand mobility between the two cities. = 1986‚Äì2009: Major Investment Study = While the Research Triangle Park's birth in the 1950s and regional events like the 1987 Olympics Festival began to culturally unify the Triangle as a single metropolitan area, it still lacked a regional, integrated network of infrastructure in fields such as public transportation in the mid-late 20th century. A study from UNC-Chapel Hill first addressed this demand in June 1987, arguing for local governments to proactively implement strategies for land use and mobility instead of reacting to changing transportation patterns. The report recommended Triangle governments to: * strategize land use patterns as a region by preserving rights-of-way; * proactively designing master plans through a regional transit agency, and; * creating a fixed-guide transit system once denser development is available. In response, the North Carolina General Assembly chartered GoTriangle (then branded as the Triangle Transit Authority, or TTA) in 1989 and charged it with developing a regional transit plan for the Triangle. Chapel Hill, Durham, private landowners, and the state department of transportation drafted a \\"corridor master plan\\" from 1993 to 1994, and identified \\"areas of congestion and methods to improve mobility\\" between the two cities. Using this conclusion, TTA continued to identify transit management methods and potential environmental impacts in developing the corridor, and held workshops with UNC and Duke University on those topics. These efforts culminated with TTA formally identifying \\"a need for rail or bus transit fixed guideway between Durham and Chapel Hill\\" in its 2001 Major Investment Study (MIS). The first and second phases of the MIS considered the Durham-Chapel Hill connection as an expansion of the Raleigh-Durham regional rail project, and together compared the following options: * a no-build alternative (i.e. control group) * transportation system demand management (i.e. optimizing existing bus services) * extending diesel train (DMU) service from the Raleigh-Durham project * upgrading the arterial US-15/501 into a freeway * adding HOV lanes to US-15/501 * bus rapid transit (BRT), then termed as an \\"exclusive busway\\" * busway/mixed traffic (a hybrid of BRT and bus operations in roads) * light rail transit (LRT) The MIS recommended that Durham and Chapel Hill be connected by a new fixed-route transit corridor. However, the report cited concerns that \\"assumptions [in its ridership projection models] may have overprojected\\" ridership and cost performance estimates, and recommended further studies before identifying a specific transit technology for the corridor. Despite this, Durham and Orange counties adopted and integrated the MIS recommendations into its transit and regional development plans. TTA moved forward with conducting environmental studies for the Raleigh-Durham segment of its regional rail concept, with the intent of funding it through a three-step grant program by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and kickstarting studies on the Durham-Chapel Hill section. However, TTA failed to provide adequate rider and financial projections of its proposed system, a requirement in the grant program, resulting in a \\"low\\" overall project rating. Rather than addressing the FTA's concerns to continue the development process, TTA withdrew its regional rail proposal from the New Starts program in August 2006. = 2007‚Äì2014: transit referendum and BRT proposal = Following the results of the regional rail study, TTA (then rebranded to Triangle Transit) revised its strategies on transit planning by establishing a Special Transit Advisory Commission in 2007. On August 27, 2009, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill to allow local governments to fund local transit projects through a 1/2-cent sales tax increase; the Orange and Durham counties passed the tax increases by referenda in 2011 and 2012, allowing for new transit improvements to be partially self-funded. The alternatives analysis (AA), the first required step in planning and developing an FTA-funded project, once again compared light rail, BRT, and transportation system management with updated models and development assumptions. The AA imposed that the following requirements be fulfilled to identify the best option for an improved Durham-Chapel Hill connection: * Improve mobility through and within the Durham/Chapel Hill corridor * Increase transit efficiency and quality of service * Improve transit connections * Support local/regional economic development and planned growth management initiatives * Foster environmental stewardship * Provide cost-effective transit investment The resulting report found that light rail and BRT, both of which would share roughly similar routes, equally meet the mobility and environmental stewardship demands posed by the AA. However, BRT performed worse than light rail in \\"supporting compact development and economic growth, travel time savings, and the cost effectiveness of expanding long-term transit capacity\\". Furthermore, BRT would have required Triangle Transit to acquire additional private property for required road widening, as well to avoid right-of-way conflicts with nearby freight rail operators. Representatives from North Carolina Railroad, CSX, and Norfolk Southern, commented that they \\"would not accept the operation of busway/HOV lanes in any railroad corridor in which they operated\\" unlike for light rail. While the AA noted BRT's lower construction cost with respect to light rail, comparisons to existing BRT systems such as the South Busway in Pittsburgh or Cleveland's HealthLine failed to demonstrate \\"public support and a proven record of producing local and regional economic development benefits by enhancing and focusing growth\\". Recommended with light rail over BRT on the grounds of improved operational costs, development opportunities, and perceived ridership, Triangle Transit finalized its locally-preferred alternative (LPA) of light rail in April 2012. The LPA also considered interlining existing bus services (i.e. running GoDurham and Chapel Hill Transit buses partly in the same route as BRT or light rail) and comparing its performance to a non- interlined service. While this scenario resulted in ridership estimates for BRT that were similar to light rail, the LPA noted that estimates \\"do not account for passengers that would transfer from feeder buses to BRT if the feeder buses were not sharing the BRT guideway\\". Given these considerations as well as difficulties in safety, logistics, and design expressed by Triangle Transit, interlining was eventually dropped as a possible design feature. With the alternatives study accepted by the FTA, Triangle Transit continued with scoping studies to formally outline the need and environmental constraints of its light rail proposal. The further studies culminated in an environment impact statement and record of decision, which was approved in 2016. = 2019: Discontinuation = On March 27, 2019, the GoTriangle board of trustees voted to discontinue the project. Board members stated that it had become impossible to meet increased expenses and address difficulty acquiring right of way along Duke University's campus by deadlines set in state law.  Proposed route  The proposed route connects downtown Chapel Hill with western and downtown Durham via Duke University. The route starts just south of UNC Hospitals, and continues east past the Dean Smith Center towards the Meadowmont neighborhood of Chapel Hill. It will then pass through Leigh Village, a planned transit- oriented development, and run parallel alongside the region's major commuting pathways of I-40 and US-15/501. DOLRT's proposed route continues northwards through the medical campus of Duke University, then runs parallel to the North Carolina Railroad alignment through the Ninth Street shopping district, and the Brightleaf, American Tobacco, and downtown Durham historic districts. Finally, the route continues through the historic Hayti \\"Black Wall Street\\" business district before terminating at North Carolina Central University. Alt URL The line was projected to begin construction in 2020 and be completed by 2028. End-to-end travel time would have been 42‚Äì44 minutes. = Carrboro extension = Orange County's transit plan also includes a provision to study the idea to extend light rail westward to the neighboring town of Carrboro between 2035 and 2045. However, this is contingent on further studies and the repeal of transit funding restrictions imposed by the General Assembly.  Project development  The original project was estimated at $1.4 billion (in 2011) with 25% from local taxpayers + 25% from the state + 50% from the Federal government. The current project is estimated to cost $2.5 billion (year of expenditure) with 40% from local taxpayers + 10% from the state + 50% from the Federal government ‚Äì or $141 million per mile with an annual operating cost of $28.7 million. As of April 2018, the maximum available state funding was $183 million (or approximately 7.3%). A final environmental impact statement was released by GoTriangle in February 2016, projecting 23,020 daily trips in 2040. The plan was amended to extend to NCCU in November 2016, projecting 26,880 daily trips in 2040.  Proposed stations  The line would have had 18 stations (4 stations in Orange County, 14 stations in Durham County), with an additional station proposed in downtown Durham. These stations are as follows. * UNC Hospital * Mason Farm Road * Hamilton Road *Friday Center Drive * Woodmont * Leigh Village * Gateway * Patterson Place * Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway * South Square * LaSalle Street * Duke / VA Medical Center * Ninth Street * Buchanan Boulevard * Durham station *Blackwell/Mangum (proposed) * Dillard Street * Alston Avenue * NCCU  Controversies  = Strategic disagreements = Public comments about DOLRT often focus on the limited scope of the project, especially how it does not extend to Research Triangle Park or Raleigh-Durham International Airport. While a 2007 analysis by the Special Transit Advisory Commission acknowledged that an airport rail link is a valid need that GoTriangle also envisions, a joint study with the airport found that \\"final decisions on a specific alignment\\" would be \\"premature\\" without a separate study. = Cost uncertainty = Due to the shifting scope of the project and GoTriangle's access to funding sources, cost estimates for planning and constructing the Durham- Orange light rail have regularly changed.  General Assembly intervention  On September 14, 2015, the North Carolina General Assembly released a budget amendment that capped the maximum funding for regional transit projects to $500,000.  Downtown Durham right-of-way  Michael Goodmon, vice president of real estate for the local media conglomerate Capitol Broadcasting Company, and Brad Brinegar, chairman of the McKinney advertising agency, resigned from their board positions in GoTriangle's fundraising arm in November 2018. Goodmon was the chairman of GoTransit Partners prior to his resignation. = Construction of a Rail Operation and Maintenance Facility = The locally-preferred alternative of light rail in 2012 included provisions for potential locations for a maintenance center, which included one near Farrington Road in southwest Durham. While this location was selected due to it being the cheapest option and causing the least environmental and noise impacts, it also required the displacement of six homes and rezoning. = Objections by Duke University = Vincent Price, the president of Duke University, appointed the school's executive vice president Dr. Tallman Trask III as its point of contact in November 2018. Trask was charged with the \\"sole authority to provide information and make decisions on all operational issues\\" in addressing Duke's concerns on patient and ambulance access to hospital facilities, traffic pattern changes near the American Tobacco campus, and operational interruptions from construction. In response to these concerns, GoTriangle released a report on the potential of electromagnetic interference by light rail on medical and scientific instruments, as well as potential strategies for its mitigation. Furthermore, GoTriangle also developed additional design changes to maintain power and ambulance access, address and closely monitor noise and vibration from construction, and prevent special event traffic from being obstructed by light rail. Despite extensive negotiations and accommodations, Duke ultimately declined to sign a cooperative agreement on February 27, 2019. Duke previously had helped kill off an earlier rail project in the 1990s connecting Raleigh to Durham via a diesel self-contained DMU vehicle. Duke officials noted that the proposed route would go through the heart of Duke's medical facilities. They contended that the level of vibration caused by construction, as well as electromagnetic interference from trains, posed an unacceptable risk to the medical facilities. This was despite similar light rail projects being successful at medical facilities in Houston and Minneapolis. Duke was also unable to reach an agreement with GoTriangle on liability insurance in the event of a major incident on the line {{cite Local community members and elected representatives voiced disapproval and accusations of poor faith in response, including a suggestion by Durham city council member Mark-Anthony Middleton to invoke eminent domain.

During the last 150 years, thousands of papers focusing on the effects or side effects of magnetic or radiofrequency fields have been published. They can be categorized as incidental and physiological. Contraindications to MRI include most cochlear implants and cardiac pacemakers, shrapnel and metallic foreign bodies in the eyes. The safety of MRI during the first trimester of pregnancy is uncertain, but it may be preferable to other options. Since MRI does not use any ionizing radiation, its use generally is favored in preference to CT when either modality could yield the same information. (In certain cases, MRI is not preferred as it may be more expensive, time-consuming and claustrophobia-exacerbating). Structure and certification In an effort to standardize the roles and responsibilities of MRI professionals, an international consensus document, written and endorsed by major MRI and medical physics professional societies from around the globe, has been published formally. The document outlines specific responsibilities for the following positions: * MR Medical Director / Research Director (MRMD) ‚Äì This individual is the supervising physician who has oversight responsibility for the safe use of MRI services. * MR Safety Officer (MRSO) ‚Äì Roughly analogous to a radiation safety officer, the MRSO acts on behalf of, and on the instruction of, the MRMD to execute safety procedures and practices at the point of care. * MR Safety Expert (MRSE) ‚Äì This individual serves in a consulting role to both the MRMD and MRSO, assisting in the investigation of safety questions that may include the need for extrapolation, interpolation, or quantification to approximate the risk of a specific study. The American Board of Magnetic Resonance Safety (ABMRS) provides testing and board certification for each of the three positions, MRMD, MRSO, and MRSE. As most MRI accidents and injuries are directly attributable to decisions at the point of care, testing and certification of MRI professionals seeks to reduce the rates of MRI accidents and improve patient safety through the establishment of safety competency levels for MRI professionals. Implants All patients are reviewed for contraindications prior to MRI scanning. Medical devices and implants are categorized as MR Safe, MR Conditional or MR Unsafe: * MR-Safe ‚Äì The device or implant is completely non-magnetic, non-electrically conductive, and non-RF reactive, eliminating all of the primary potential threats during an MRI procedure. * MR-Conditional ‚Äì A device or implant that may contain magnetic, electrically conductive, or RF-reactive components that is safe for operations in proximity to the MRI, provided the conditions for safe operation are defined and observed (such as 'tested safe to 1.5 teslas' or 'safe in magnetic fields below 500 gauss in strength'). * MR-Unsafe ‚Äì Objects that are significantly ferromagnetic and pose a clear and direct threat to persons and equipment within the magnet room. The MRI environment may cause harm in patients with MR-Unsafe devices such as cochlear implants, aneurysm clips, and many permanent pacemakers. In November 1992, a patient with an undisclosed cerebral aneurysm clip was reported to have died shortly after an MRI exam. Several deaths have been reported in patients with pacemakers who have undergone MRI scanning without appropriate precautions. Increasingly, MR-conditional pacemakers are available for selected patients. Ferromagnetic foreign bodies such as shell fragments, or metallic implants such as surgical prostheses and ferromagnetic aneurysm clips also are potential risks. Interaction of the magnetic and radio frequency fields with such objects may lead to heating or torque of the object during an MRI. Titanium and its alloys are safe from attraction and torque forces produced by the magnetic field, although there may be some risks associated with Lenz effect forces acting on titanium implants in sensitive areas within the subject, such as stapes implants in the inner ear. Intrauterine devices with copper are generally safe in MRI, but may become dislodged or even expelled, and it is therefore recommended to check the location of the IUD both before and after MRI. Projectile risk The very high strength of the magnetic field may cause projectile effect (or \\"missile-effect\\") accidents, where ferromagnetic objects are attracted to the center of the magnet. Pennsylvania reported 27 cases of objects becoming projectiles in the MRI environment between 2004 and 2008. There have been incidents of injury and death.Randal C.

McNeil Jr, \\"M.R.I.'s Strong Magnets Cited in Accidents,\\" The New York Times, August 19, 2005. In one case, a six-year-old boy died in July 2001, during an MRI exam at the Westchester Medical Center, New York, after a metal oxygen tank was pulled across the room and crushed the child's head. To reduce the risk of projectile accidents, ferromagnetic objects and devices are typically prohibited near the MRI scanner, and patients undergoing MRI examinations must remove all metallic objects, often by changing into a gown or scrubs. Some radiology departments use ferromagnetic detection devices to ensure that no ferromagnetic objects enter the scanner room. MRI-EEG In research settings, structural MRI or functional MRI (fMRI) may be combined with EEG (electroencephalography) under the condition that the EEG equipment is MR- compatible. Although EEG equipment (electrodes, amplifiers, and peripherals) are either approved for research or clinical use, the same MR Safe, MR Conditional and MR Unsafe terminology applies. With the growth of the use of MR technology, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration [FDA] recognized the need for a consensus on standards of practice, and the FDA sought out ASTM International [ASTM] to achieve them. Committee F04 \\"Committee F04 on Medical and Surgical Materials and Devices.\\" Committee F04 of ASTM developed F2503, Standard Practice for Marking Medical Devices and Other Items for Safety in the Magnetic Resonance Environment.ASTM Standard F2503 ‚Äì 13, 2013, \\"Standard Practice for Marking Medical Devices and Other Items for Safety in the Magnetic Resonance Environment,\\" ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2003, , Standards F2503. Genotoxic effects There is no proven risk of biological harm from any aspect of an MRI scan, including very powerful static magnetic fields, gradient magnetic fields, or radio frequency waves. Some studies have suggested possible genotoxic (i.e., potentially carcinogenic) effects of MRI scanning through micronuclei induction and DNA double strand breaks in vivo and in vitro, however, in most, if not all cases, others have been unable to repeat or validate the results of these studies, and the majority of research shows no genotoxic, or otherwise harmful, effects caused by any part of MRI. A recent study confirmed that MRI using some of the most potentially-risky parameters tested to date (7-tesla static magnetic field, 70 mT/m gradient magnetic field, and maximum strength radio frequency waves) did not cause any DNA damage in vitro. Peripheral nerve stimulation The rapid switching on and off of the magnetic field gradients is capable of causing nerve stimulation. Volunteers report a twitching sensation when exposed to rapidly switched fields, particularly in their extremities. The reason the peripheral nerves are stimulated is that the changing field increases with distance from the center of the gradient coils (which more or less coincides with the center of the magnet). Although PNS was not a problem for the slow, weak gradients used in the early days of MRI, the strong, rapidly switched gradients used in techniques such as EPI, fMRI, diffusion MRI, etc. are capable of inducing PNS. American and European regulatory agencies insist that manufacturers stay below specified dB/dt limits (dB/dt is the change in magnetic field strength per unit time), or else prove that no PNS is induced for any imaging sequence. As a result of dB/dt limitation, commercial MRI systems cannot use the full rated power of their gradient amplifiers. Heating caused by absorption of radio waves Every MRI scanner has a powerful radio transmitter that generates the electromagnetic field that excites the spins. If the body absorbs the energy, heating occurs. For this reason, the transmitter rate at which energy is absorbed by the body must be limited (see Specific absorption rate). It has been claimed that tattoos made with iron-containing dyes may lead to burns on the subject's body. Cosmetics are very unlikely to undergo heating, as well as body lotions, since the outcome of the reactions between those with the radio waves is unknown. The best option for clothing is 100% cotton. There are several positions strictly forbidden during measurement such as crossing arms and legs, and the patient's body may not create loops of any kind for the RF during the measurement. Acoustic noise Switching of field gradients causes a change in the Lorentz force experienced by the gradient coils, producing minute expansions and contractions of the coil. As the switching typically is in the audible frequency range, the resulting vibration produces loud noises (clicking, banging or beeping). This behaviour, of sound being generated by the vibration of the conducting components, is described as a coupled acousto-magneto- mechanical system, solutions to which provide useful insight to the behaviour of the scanners. This is most marked with high-field machines,\\"The Evolution of Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 3T MRI in Clinical Applications\\" , Terry Duggan-Jahns, www.eradimaging.com and rapid-imaging techniques in which sound pressure levels may reach 120 dB(A) (equivalent to a jet engine at take-off), and therefore, appropriate ear protection is essential for anyone inside the MRI scanner room during the examination.The Open University 2007: Understanding Cardiovascular Diseases, course book for the lesson SK121 Understanding cardiovascular diseases, printed by Cambridge University Press, (can be found at OUW), pages 220 and 224. Radio frequency in itself does not cause audible noises (at least for human beings), since modern systems are using frequencies of 8.5 MHz (0.2 T system) or higher. Cryogens As described in the Physics of magnetic resonance imaging article, many MRI scanners rely on cryogenic liquids to enable the superconducting capabilities of the electromagnetic coils within. Although the cryogenic liquids used are non-toxic, their physical properties present specific hazards. An unintentional shut-down of a superconducting electromagnet, an event known as \\"quench\\", involves the rapid boiling of liquid helium from the device. If the rapidly expanding helium cannot be dissipated through an external vent, sometimes referred to as a 'quench pipe', it may be released into the scanner room where it may cause displacement of the oxygen and present a risk of asphyxiation. Oxygen deficiency monitors usually are used as a safety precaution. Liquid helium, the most commonly used cryogen in MRI, undergoes near explosive expansion as it changes from a liquid to gaseous state. The use of an oxygen monitor is important to ensure that oxygen levels are safe for patients and physicians. Rooms built for superconducting MRI equipment should be equipped with pressure relief mechanisms International Electrotechnical Commission 2008: Medical Electrical Equipment ‚Äì Part 2-33: Particular requirements for basic safety and essential performance of magnetic resonance equipment for medical diagnosis, manufacturers' trade standards , published by International Electrotechnical Commission, (can be found for purchase at ). and an exhaust fan, in addition to the required quench pipe. Because a quench results in rapid loss of cryogens from the magnet, recommissioning the magnet is expensive and time-consuming. Spontaneous quenches are uncommon, but a quench also may be triggered by an equipment malfunction, an improper cryogen fill technique, contaminants inside the cryostat, or extreme magnetic or vibrational disturbances. Pregnancy No effects of MRI on the fetus have been demonstrated. As opposed to many other forms of medical imaging in pregnancy, MRI avoids the use of ionizing radiation, to which the fetus is particularly sensitive. As a precaution, however, many guidelines recommend pregnant women only undergo MRI when essential, especially during the first trimester. The concerns in pregnancy are the same as for MRI in general, but the fetus may be more sensitive to the effects‚Äîparticularly to heating and to noise. The use of gadolinium-based contrast media in pregnancy is an off-label indication and may be administered only in the lowest dose required to provide essential diagnostic information. Despite these concerns, MRI is rapidly growing in importance as a way of diagnosing and monitoring congenital defects of the fetus because it is able to provide more diagnostic information than ultrasound and it lacks the ionizing radiation of CT. MRI without contrast agents is the imaging mode of choice for pre-surgical, in-utero diagnosis and evaluation of fetal tumors, primarily teratomas, facilitating open fetal surgery, other fetal interventions, and planning for procedures (such as the EXIT procedure) to safely deliver and treat babies whose defects would otherwise be fatal. Claustrophobia and discomfort Although painless, MRI scans may be unpleasant for those who are claustrophobic or otherwise uncomfortable with the imaging device surrounding them. Older closed bore MRI systems have a fairly long tube or tunnel. The part of the body being imaged must lie at the center of the magnet, which is at the absolute center of the tunnel. Because scan times on these older scanners may be long (occasionally up to 40 minutes for the entire procedure), people with even mild claustrophobia are sometimes unable to tolerate an MRI scan without management. Some modern scanners have larger bores (up to 70 cm) and scan times are shorter. A 1.5 T wide short bore scanner increases the examination success rate in patients with claustrophobia and substantially reduces the need for anesthesia-assisted MRI examinations even when claustrophobia is severe. Alternative scanner designs, such as open or upright systems, may be helpful where these are available. Although open scanners have increased in popularity, they produce inferior scan quality because they operate at lower magnetic fields than closed scanners. Commercial 1.5-tesla open systems have become available recently, however, providing much better image quality than previous lower field strength open models. Mirror glasses may be used to help create the illusion of openness. The mirrors are angled at 45 degrees, allowing the patient to look down their body and out the end of the imaging area. The appearance is of an open tube pointing upward (as seen when lying in the imaging area). Even though one is able to see around the glasses and the proximity of the device is very evident, this illusion is quite persuasive and relieves the claustrophobic feeling. For young children who cannot hold still or would be frightened during the examination, chemical sedation or general anesthesia are the norm. Some hospitals encourage children to pretend the MRI machine is a spaceship or other adventure. Certain hospitals with Children's wards have decorated scanners for this purpose, such as that at the Boston Children's Hospital, which operates a scanner with a special casing designed to resemble a sandcastle. Obese patients and pregnant women may find the MRI machine a tight fit. Pregnant women in the third trimester also may have difficulty lying on their backs for an hour or more without moving. MRI versus CT MRI and computed tomography (CT) are complementary imaging technologies and each has advantages and limitations for particular applications. CT is more widely used than MRI in OECD countries with a mean of 132 vs. 46 exams per 1000 population performed respectively. A concern is the potential for CT to contribute to radiation-induced cancer and in 2007 it was estimated that 0.4% of current cancers in the United States were due to CTs performed in the past, and that in the future this figure may rise to 1.5‚Äì2% based on historical rates of CT usage. An Australian study found that one in every 1800 CT scans was associated with an excess cancer. An advantage of MRI is that no ionizing radiation is used and so it is recommended over CT when either approach could yield the same diagnostic information. Although the cost of MRI has fallen, making it more competitive with CT, there are not many common imaging scenarios in which MRI can simply replace CT, however, this substitution has been suggested for the imaging of liver disease. The effect of low doses of radiation on carcinogenesis also are disputed. Although MRI is associated with biological effects, these have not been proven to cause measurable harm. Iodinated contrast medium is routinely used in CT and the main adverse events are anaphylactoid reactions and nephrotoxicity. Commonly used MRI contrast agents have a good safety profile, but linear non-ionic agents in particular have been implicated in nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with severely impaired renal function. MRI is contraindicated in the presence of MR-unsafe implants, and although these patients may be imaged with CT, beam hardening artefact from metallic devices, such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, also may affect image quality. MRI is a longer investigation than CT and an exam may take between 20 and 40 minutes depending on complexity. Guidance Safety issues, including the potential for biostimulation device interference, movement of ferromagnetic bodies, and incidental localized heating, have been addressed in the American College of Radiology's White Paper on MR Safety, which originally was published in 2002 and expanded in 2004. The ACR White Paper on MR Safety has been rewritten and was released early in 2007 under the new title ACR Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices. In December 2007, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), a UK healthcare regulatory body, issued their Safety Guidelines for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Equipment in Clinical Use. In February 2008, the Joint Commission, a U.S. healthcare accrediting organization, issued a Sentinel Event Alert #38, their highest patient safety advisory, on MRI safety issues. In July 2008, the United States Veterans Administration, a federal governmental agency serving the healthcare needs of former military personnel, issued a substantial revision to their MRI Design Guide, that includes physical and facility safety considerations. The European Directive on electromagnetic fields This Directive (2013/35/EU ‚Äì electromagnetic fields) covers all known direct biophysical effects and indirect effects caused by electromagnetic fields within the EU and repealed the 2004/40/EC directive. The deadline for implementation of the new directive was 1 July 2016. Article 10 of the directive sets out the scope of the derogation for MRI, stating that the exposure limits may be exceeded during \\"the installation, testing, use, development, maintenance of or research related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment for patients in the health sector, provided that certain conditions are met.\\" Uncertainties remain regarding the scope and conditions of this derogation.

It was designed in an Arts and Crafts style by the architect Arthur Jessop Hardwick. The client was a Henry Simpson. The house, a Grade II* listed building, remains a private residence and is not visible from the public highway, although the gatehouse can be seen. History In the early 20th century the Dukes of Beaufort sold off their extensive Monmouthshire estates, centred on Troy House. The site of Tredean was purchased by a Mr Henry Simpson, who began the construction of a large house in the Arts and Crafts style. His architect was Arthur Hardwick and the house was completed between 1901-02. Tredean remains a private house which was marketed for ¬£2.25m in 2002. As of August 2020, the house, renamed Devauden Manor, is again for sale, with a guide price of ¬£3.5M. The house cannot be seen from the road, although the lodge, also in private ownership and with its own Grade II listing, and which the architectural historian John Newman considered \\"pert\\", gives a flavour of the house's style. Architecture and description John Newman describes Tredean as \\"a large and ambitious house in a loose Voyseyesque style\\". Cadw records its terraced setting, on the side of a steep hill, \\"two- storey and-attic with a full basement due to the artificial ground level\\". It describes the interior as \\"more Norman Shaw 'olde English' than Voysey\\" and notes the \\"very high standard\\" of the house's restoration in the very late 20th century. The house is Grade II* listed, with the lodge, the stable block and garage, and the teahouse in the garden, all having their own Grade II listings. Coflein records that the house is \\"almost unaltered\\" since its construction. The rooms in the house include a panelled entrance hall with stained glass, a dining room and sitting room with some reproduction fittings in the original style, a billiard room and a bathroom of 1902 with its \\"tiling and sanitary ware all complete\\". The terraced gardens surrounding the house were developed later, c.1910, but follow the Arts and Crafts style.

Early life and family Born in Dunedin on 6 January 1920, Lawrence was the daughter of Edward Hanratty Dunn and Ellen Clarke Dunn (n√©e Ferguson). In 1946 she married Clynton John Christie Lawrence in Dunedin. Swimming career Dunn first came to national attention in 1935, when she broke the New Zealand 100 metres breaststroke record, previously held by Gladys Pidgeon, with a time of 1:39.6. The record was later broken by Judith Webster of Auckland, but Dunn regained the record in December 1937 with a time of 1:33.0. She also broke the national 220 yard breaststroke record, swimming 3:22.6, and was subsequently selected to represent New Zealand in the 220 yards breaststroke at the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney. She went on to finish seventh in that event. She was also a member of the New Zealand 3 x 110 yard medley relay team at the Sydney games, alongside Mona Leydon and Joyce Macdonald, that finished in fifth place with a time of 4:22.3. Dunn was the New Zealand 220 yards breaststroke champion every year from 1938 to 1941, and the 100 yards breastroke champion from 1939 to 1941. In 1939, Dunn broke the New Zealand 400 metres breaststroke record by 45.2 seconds, recording a time of 7 minutes 11 seconds. She also held the New Zealand 100 metres breaststroke record, with a time of 1:31.4, for 14 years, until it was broken by Rae Currie in 1954. As Winifred Lawrence, she became a well-known swimming coach in Auckland over many decades, retiring in 2002. Honours In the 2000 Queen's Birthday Honours, Lawrence was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to swimming. In 2001 she was made a life member of the Auckland Swimming Association. Death Lawrence was widowed by the death of her husband in 2001.

History The first wooden Trinity church was constructed on Troitskaya (Trinity) square in 1810. After some decades passed, in 1830, the church fence collapsed. View of Novocherkassk from its southern side, The Trinity church can also been seen here In 1835, parishioners began to appeal to church authorities about the need to build a stone church. The project of a two-story stone church was drafted by architect Sedov in January 1845. Yet St. Petersburg Main Office of Public Buildings and Railways sent to Novocherkassk its own project of the Trinity Church. The city government refused both projects because of their small capacity, and decided to create a new one. Architect Fomin, who compiled a project of a tripartite, five-domed, Byzantine-style church was asked to draft an appropriate project, which was later finished and approved on August 2, 1845. Only five years later, on June 24, 1850, with the blessing of the Archbishop of Don and Novocherkassk, Ioann Dobrozrakov, a solemn laying of the stone church was done. In 1856 the church was completed. Icons for iconostasis were painted by local artists Ardalion Zolotarev and Mikhail Golmov. The consecration of the Trinity Church took place on May 30, 1859. In June 1869, construction of brick belfry and stone refectory began. Until 1896 there were only two altars in the church ‚Äï the main one (Troitsky) and southern one (Vozdvizhensky), In 1896 the third, northern one (Pokrovsky) was arranged. In 1897, near the church a two-story building for a girls' school was opened, and in another building there was a parochial school. As of 1915, the Novocherkassk Trinity Church was five-domed, had a stone bell tower, and consisted of two floors. The main dome had a conical shape with eight windows. The crosses on the chapels of the church were made of iron, but were also gilded. In the lower tier of bell tower there were ten bells. The refectory of the Trinity Church was very spacious - 12 meters long, 8.5 meters wide and 9.6 meters high. At the entrance to the church on the right and left sides were the choirs. The Trinity Church was closed in the mid-1930s during a massive anti-religious campaign. Shortly after it was destroyed..

The postholder was chiefly responsible for the command of the English navy's fleet based at Portsmouth, which operated in the English Channel, Irish Sea and Atlantic Ocean, from 1294 to 1412.  History  The origin of the office of Admiral of the West dates back to 1294, with the appointment of Sir William, Baron de Leybourne, originally styled Admiral of the West and Irish Sea. He also jointly held the title of Admiral of the South until 1306, when that post was left vacant; it resumed very briefly in 1325. In 1326, the post of Admiral of the South and its command duties were merged with that of Admiral of the West. The office was styled by different names from its establishment, such as Admiral of the West and Irish Sea and Admiral on the Western Station (1294-1306), Admiral of the Western Squadron and Admiral West, of the mouth of the Thames (1306-1406). With the exception of the periods for the creation of the offices of the Admiral of the North and West from 18 July 1360 to 16 January 1361, and the office of Admiral of all the Fleets about England from 16 January 1361 to 28 April 1362, no further official appointments were made. The office resumed again until the creation of the office of the Admiral of England from April 1385 to 18 March 1388, when once more appointments ceased. The post was revived in 1388, and lasted until the creation of the office of Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine some time between 1406 and 1412. The first royal commission as Admiral to a naval officer was granted in 1303. By 1344 it was only used as a rank at sea for a captain in charge of a fleet or fleets. This command, along with that of Admiral of the North, was regarded as one of the most senior posts in the English navy from the end of the 13th century until the beginning of the 15th century. : Rank and Role The naval defence of England from the end of the 13th century was divided into regional commands or 'admiralties' until the end of the fourteenth Century. The appointment of an admiral was not regarded by the English government at the time as an honorary post subordinate to a military rank, their importance attached to their office can be confirmed by the recording of their allowances paid recorded in the Calendar of Patent Rolls. In the fourteenth Century Admirals were paid a respectable salary which was only granted because the position was viewed as substantially important. In addition the rank of admiral was only granted to men of high prestige within feudal hierarchy, most recipients of the office were usually knights but more often earls.Rodger pp. 131-142 The Admirals duties usually consisted of assembling fleets for naval expeditions undertaken by the monarch on campaign, maintaining order and discipline and supervising the work of the Admiralty Courts for each region. On major military expeditions the Admiral would go to sea with their fleets and accompany the overall Commander-in-Chief of both sea and land forces usually the King himself but sometimes a nobleman of higher rank than the admiral. Their role was to observe and direct naval battles but not necessarily taking part in them, themselves. However, from 1344 onward their role was moving from primarily administrative one to that of a seagoing command.National Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy In 1337 the first known record of the appointment of a \\"vice-admiral' was granted to a Nicholas Ususmaris, a Genoese, he was made Vice-Admiral of the King's fleet of galleys, and all other ships of Aquitaine. However these appointments were far and few between. There was two further instances of the appointment of Vice-Admirals to Sir Thomas Drayton as Vice-Admiral of the Northern Fleet and Sir Peter Bard Vice-Admiral of the Western Fleet both on 28 July 1338. Special assistants were appointed to handle two important sub-divisions of the admirals powers. The first was the admiral's lieutenant, or deputy, referred to as sub- admirals, who handled administrative and legal duties and each of these admirals had one and often retained more knowledge than the Admiral himself in relation to the sea and coastal communities. It would not be until the early 15th century that they would appointed on a more regular basis however they were referred to at this time as the admirals Lieutenant-General this office eventually became known as the Lieutenant of the Admiralty. The second was the Wardens of the Coast for each region who were responsible for the direction and co-ordination of the fleet, the equipping of boats and processing payments to sailors and superintendence of the Sea Guard Militia assigned to each coastal county. From the mid fourteenth century there was a move to centralise these regional naval authorities as seen with the appointment of the Admiral of the Southern, Northern and Western fleets sometimes referred to as Admiral of the Fleet or Admiral of England and the Admiral of the North and West this tendency towards unifying regional naval authorities under one admiral eventually led to the creation of the office of the Lord-Admiral of England The Admirals were logistically supported by the Clerk of the Kings Ships who looked after all the navy's finances whilst victualling of the navy was handled by another one of Kings Clerks.

He supported the Provisional IRA during The Troubles and was a founder of NORAID. Irish revolutionary period Flannery was born in Cangort, near Brosna, right on the border of County Offaly and County Tipperary, on 7 January 1903. In 1916 he joined the Irish Volunteers alongside his brother Peter, although he did not take part in the Easter Rising. However, he did participate in the Irish War of Independence. Following the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, he fought as part of the Anti-Treaty IRA until his capture by the National Army on 11 November 1922 in Roscrea, County Tipperary. He imprisoned for nearly a year and a half in Dublin‚Äôs Mountjoy Prison (C Wing). While there he witnessed the execution of Anti-Treaty IRA leaders Richard Barrett, Joe McKelvey, Liam Mellows and Rory O'Connor from his cell window. Following Flannery going on a 28 day hunger strike, he was placed in the Curragh Prison Camp until 1 May 1924 when he was finally released, a full year after the end of the civil war. Moving to New York In February 1927 he immigrated to the United States of America, settling in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City. In 1928 he married Margaret Mary Egan, a Tipperary-born research chemist, who had been educated at University College Dublin and University of Geneva. Following the creation of Fianna F√°il and their entry into the Irish Parliament D√°il √âireann, Flannery became affiliated with Sinn F√©in, who had voted to retain their abstentionist policy towards the D√°il and their refusal to acknowledge it as the legitimate government of Ireland. Sinn F√©in tasked Flannery with drumming up support for the party in New York. However, following the start of the Great Depression Flannery found it difficult to focus on politics in the face of mounting poverty. By 1933 finding support for Sinn F√©in and the IRA became particularly tough when Fianna F√°il expanded greatly the range of people eligible for military pensions, which under the previous government had been biased against members of the Anti-Treaty IRA. For the next 40 years Flannery would work for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. During The Troubles Upon the onset of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, Flannery was once again drawn into the world of Irish Republicanism. In a response to the mounting violence, Flannery set up the Irish Northern Aid Committee, or as it became better known as, NORAID. The official purpose of NORAID was to provide funds to the families of imprisoned Irish Republicans and victims of violence. However, opponents levelled the accusation against the organisation that it was also providing funding directly to the Provisional Irish Republican Army, and perhaps even also supplying firearms. In 1970 he travelled around America and set up 62 chapters of NORAID. In 1971 he said: \\"The more coffins sent back to Britain, the sooner this will be all over\\", referring to British soldiers. In 1982 he was indicted, with four other members of NORAID (Thomas Falvey, Daniel Gormley, George Harrison and Patrick Mullin), for arms smuggling, but all defendants were acquitted after their legal defence was able to successfully argue their actions had been sanctioned the CIA. Four months after the verdict of the arms trial, Flannery was named as Grand Marshall of the Saint Patrick's Day Parade in New York City. His appointment caused considerable controversy within the Irish-American community and several high profile figures boycotted the parade that year, including the Archbishop of New York Terence Cooke. In 1986 Flannery quietly resigned from NORAID following the decision by Sinn F√©in to drop its abstentionist policy in the Republic of Ireland and to recognise D√°il √âireann as the legitimate governing body of Ireland. He opposed the Northern Ireland peace process, believing that Sinn F√©in and the Provisionals had \\"sold out\\", and believed the removal of British troops from Northern Ireland was the only starting point upon which negotiations could begin. He died 30 September 1994, aged 92.

He was, as she described him in one of her books, a rare companion, celebrated throughout the State as a raconteur, a historian, a student of human nature, a great reader of books, as well as men; he had a strong judicial mind, having been educated for the law. In the State Senate William Daviess represented his district for two years and at one time when offered a nomination for Congress, declined, saying that \\"politics sooner or later engulfs men's souls,\\" and he might not be able to withstand the temptations offered. Thereafter he lived the life of a \\"Latin farmer,\\" with his delightfully hospitable home always open to strangers and friends. Here Hannah Daviess spent her early life amidst the old-fashioned flowers, fields of corn, grain and hemp, in a beautiful, spacious home surrounded by well-kept lawns. Her mother, Maria Thompson, was a well-known writer of her day, a regular correspondent of The Country Gentleman and Coleman's Rural World. Her last contribution for The Country Gentleman was written on her eighty-second birthday. Hannah Daviess graduated from the Presbyterian College of Harrodsburg. Career Hannah D. Pittman was for sixteen years a member of the staff of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and during that time was also associated with John R. Reavis as assistant editor of the St. Louis Spectator, a weekly paper founded by Joseph McCulloch, John A. Dillon and Henry W. Moore, editors of local newspapers. While on the staff of the Post-Dispatch, Pittman wrote several children's plays for Professor Mahler, which were presented at Saratoga during the summer season, and later in 1883, in collaboration with Professor Robyn, wrote her most ambitious dramatic work, a comic opera, which was presented at the Pickwick Summer Garden Theater by a professional company, with Laetitia Fritsch in the title role. The success was so great that the author accepted the offer of Pope's Theater managers to open the regular season with \\"Manette.\\" The initial ovation was repeated, and from New York to London was cabled the success of the first American comic opera. Severing her connection with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Pittman devoted her time to magazine work. While so engaged she wrote a number of short stories illustrating the condition between masters and slaves during and immediately after the Civil War. In 1906, in response to a suggestion made by Hon. John Sergeant Wise, she gathered these magazine articles ‚Äî \\"Studies in Black and White\\" ‚Äî together, and wove about them the story, The belle of the Bluegrass Country : studies in black and white (1906). The book proved a great success and for years was one of the most frequently called for in the libraries. It was placed in nearly all of the college libraries in the Southern and Western States, as of historic value, from which may be learned from one upon the firing line of memory, the truth of the amazing situation during and following the Civil War. Treating also of the feudal life before the war, which is fast passing into the silence that follows every epoch of national change, the story of The Belle of the Bluegrass Country, possessing the atmosphere and charm of a bygone people and life, has attained the importance of history. Her second book, The Heart of Kentucky (1908), breathes of that stirring period when the State was almost rent in twain by two political factions. She has used the framework for a strong story, a story of the time when the heart of true chivalry beat for honor and the courage of brave men and love was an exalted thing to be vindicated at the risk of all else. It is a tragic retelling of an old tale convincingly related, giving tone and color to what appears as an incident in the history of a great State. The delicate subject is carefully handled and coming, as the book did, when the Thaw tragedy was absorbing public notice, the Heart of Kentucky attracted much attention. Pittman said of her story: \\"It is not, as some of my critics seem to think, a vindication of the unwritten law; it is a plea for the enactment of stringent laws safeguarding the home. In an ancient little cemetery in a rural district of Central Kentucky may be found a large granite slab covering the resting- place of an unhappy couple who passed out of life together one summer morning early in the nineteenth century. Inscribed on the stone are several verses written by the wife while voluntarily occupying, contrary to all law and precedent, a cell with her husband. These verses are my motif of the tragedy.\\" Pittman's other stories, Go Forth and Find (1910) (inspired by Chauncey Depew's address to the graduates of the Medico-Chirurgical College at Philadelphia, May 5, 1907), Get Married, Young Men and The Heart of a Doll (1908), have proven popular successes. However, the most notable book she wrote, Americans of Gentle Birth and their Ancestors ‚Äî upon which she bestowed six years of hard work of research ‚Äî is considered one of the most valuable works of that nature in the Congressional Library in Washington. Her last book was In dreamland : a story of living and giving (ca. 1915), illustrated by Isabella Morton. Personal life Soon after graduation, in 1857, Hannah Daviess married Williamson Haskins Pittman (1823-1875), a prominent wholesale dry goods merchant of St. Louis, senior member of the two firms ‚Äî Pittman & Bro. and Pittman & Tennant ‚Äî having been engaged in the early fifties with James E. Yeatman (Yeatman, Pittman & Co.) in a general commission business. They went to live in St. Louis. It was not long thereafter that the breaking out of the Civil War changed the whole map of the business situation in St. Louis. The Southern trade being cut off these merchants were obliged to adjust their affairs to the new situations confronting them. In this process Williamson Pittman resumed his commission business and spent several years in cotton buying. On journeys to the Southern cities Hannah Pittman accompanied her husband and became so much impressed with scenes and incidents in the lives of the people with whom she came in contact that she decided to begin writing short stories, as referred to before, which were later incorporated in her first novel. Williamson Pittman died in 1875, leaving his wife and five children, residing in St. Louis. The eldest, Nannie Trabue Pittman (1861-1936), married Archer Anderson (1859-1939), of Louisa County, Virginia. William Daviess Pittman (1863-1932), married Sarah Duncan Patterson (1862-1952), only daughter of Robert D. Patterson, and had three children, Marie D., Cora, and W. Daviess Pittman, Jr. Asa Pittman, married Rose Marian, only daughter of D. D. Walker. They both died young, leaving an only daughter, Martha Walker Pittman. Trabue Pittman (1870-1944) married Amy Louise Opel (1875-1976), and had one son, Richard Trabue Pittman. Williamson Haskins Pittman (1872-1901) died unmarried. Through lineal descent from John Thompson and Lewis Robards, officers of the Revolution, Pittman was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Through lineal descent from Col. William Claiborne, first secretary and treasurer of the Colonies, and many other Colonial officers, she was a Colonial Dames of America, and a Colonial Daughter of the seventeenth century'. Through John West (governor), William C. C. Claiborne and Governor Wormley she belongs to the Hereditary Order of Descendants of Colonial Governors. Pittman died in 1919, and is buried with her husband at Bellefontaine Cemetery, Saint Louis.

After the end of the war, Koehl made a name for himself for his research on national socialism,https://history.wisc.edu/robertkoehl_memorial.htm notably of studies on Heinrich Himmler as Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood, as well as a pioneering work on the Nazi German during the Occupation of Poland (1939‚Äì1945). Koehl coined the term \\"neofeudalism\\" for the characterization of the national socialist rule, and completed an account of the history of the SS in 1983.  Biography  Robert Lewis Koehl was born on 6 March 1922 in Chicago, Illinois. He studied in at Harvard University, where he was admitted as member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1943, Koehl married Lieselotte Franziska Eisenhardt, who had emigrated from Nazi Germany in 1939, and the couple had three children.-koehl / Obituary: Lilo Koehl . In: Daily Courier , 6 September 2015 During the World War II he interrupted his studies for the war service, serving as surveyor and interpreter for the U.S. Army Intelligence in Nazi German-occupied Europe. Back in Harvard he acquired his Master of Arts in 1947 with the work A Prelude to the Third Reich. In 1950, he earned his Doctor degree on Heinrich Himmler as Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood. He subsequently taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, at University of Nebraska in Lincoln and from 1964 until his retirement 1997 in the Department of Educational Policy Studies of University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, a department of which he was an early founder.  Research  Koehl's work focused on European history, especially the history of national socialism. His doctorate thesis, published in revised form in 1957, was mainly based on material of the RuSHA trial, and for a long time was one of few papers on the National Socialist Settlement and Population Policy in the German occupation of Poland.1939 Isabel Heinemann: Race, Settlement, German Blood. 'The Breed and Settlement Headquarters of the SS and the Reorganization of Europe's Racial Policy.' '2nd edition. Wallstein Verlag, G√∂ttingen, 2013, , p. 36. Inspired by the feudalism concept, Koehl coined the term \\"neofeudalism\\" to describe national socialism. He wanted in particular to grasp the domination conditions in the German-occupied East, where German rule was personalized and local commanders had absolute power.Hans Mommsen: 'Cumulative radicalization and progressive self-destruction as structural determinants of the Nazi dictatorship . In: Ian Kershaw & Moshe Lewin (Hg.): Stalinism and Nazism. Dictatorship in Comparison . This was an early attempt to understand the irrational aspects of national socialism. In pointing out the similarities between the charismatic elements of medieval and national socialist rule, Koehl opposed later attempts to conceive of national socialism as charismatic rule in the sense of Max Weber. However, recent research does not follow Koehl's assumption that the feudalist power relations originated from the atavistic ideology of national socialism.Robert Koehl: Feudal Aspects of National Socialism (1960). In: Neil Gregor (eds.): Nazism . Oxford UP, Oxford 2000, p. 183. Koehl also referred back to the term \\"Concentration Camp - SS\\". He thus designated a group of SS members in the concentration camps, which were not seconded to battlefields of the Waffen-SS. According to Karin Orth, Koehl's concept of historical reality corresponds to a national socialist functioneer elite.Karin Orth: SS perpetrators in court. The Crime of the Concentration Camp SS After Warfare In: Irtrud Wojak (eds.): Court Day Hold On Ourself ... ': History and Impact of the First Frankfurt Auschwitz Process Effect of the Holocaust .

Country The Mandandanji owned of tribal territory, which took in the Maranoa and Balonne rivers north of St. George. Their western exrtension reached as far Bollon and Wallam Creek. Their northern frontier was around Donnybrook, Orallo and Yuleba. Their eastern flank was formed by Alton and Glenmorgan. Mitchell, Roma and Surat all lay within Mandandanji territory. Social organization The Mandandanji were divided into hordes. * The Kogai, a northerly horde, lived around the headwaters of Coogoon Creek. History of contact The Mandandanji put up considerable resistance to white colonial encroachments on their land. They were led by a leader, Bussamarai, who was later singled out by the settler Gideon Lang as one of the cleverest Aborigines he had heard of, versatile, an orator of distinction, diplomat and warrior by turns as the occasion demanded. Known also as Eaglehawk, he developed battle tactics worthy of a general that created setbacks for the whites on several occasions of confrontation. These consisted in mustering large numbers of warriors in a deep line, with a fortified centre. The thinner flanks or wings were so deployed that any whites charging on horseback could not sight and dodge the spears thrown at them, compelling them to retreat. If the cavalry rallied back, he would have the wings of his troops fold back in to the core group of fighters. Bussamarai had also managed to form a coalition with 5 neighbouring tribes, and many ourtback stations had to be abandoned. The story of their struggles and defeat has been the object of an intensive study by Patrick Collins. Eventually, already in this early period, the Mandandanji melded in with the Kunggari and these two were, in reports, often confused. The missionary William Ridley travelled through the district of Surat in 1855, found the natives quick at learning, and friendly, though guards were required since the area was still considered dangerous. The theatrical performance During a lull in the skirmishing, Bussamarai convened 500 members from his tribal amphictyony near Surat, in order to perform an unprecedented public corroboree before the local commissioner and other settlers. The scenography for the performance, conducted under moonlight, was established by setting the stage within the clearing of an open glade, 200 yards in diameter, which was girdled by thick stands of timber. About 100 women formed into a chorus which chanted a commentary on the sequence of mimed events, one consisting in repeating the lines fed to them by Bussamarai, who orchestrated the event. The action unfolded to the rhythmic thumping of a sack of earth with sticks, to maintain the tempo. Lang then describes the three acts the tribe stage- managed. > The first act of the corroboree was the representation of a herd of cattle, > feeding out of the forest and camping on the plain, the black performers > being painted accordingly. The imitation was most skillful, the action and > attitude of every individual member of the entire herd being ludicrously > exact. Some lay down and chewed the cud, others stood scratching themselves > with hind feet or horns, licking themselves or their calves; several rubbing > their heads against eaeh other in bucolic friendliness. The second act then began: > A party of blacks was seen creeping towards the cattle, taking all the usual > precautions, such as keeping to windward, in order to prevent the herd from > being alarmed. They got up close to the cattle at last, and speared two > head, to the intense delight of the black spectators, who applauded > rapturously. The hunters next went through the various operations of > skinning, cutting up, and carrying away the pieces, the whole process being > carried out with the most minute exactness. The third and final act consisted of a pitched battle between the marauding Aborigines and the stock owners. It began: > with the sound of horses galloping through the timber, followed by the > appearance of a party of whites on horseback, remarkably well got up. The > face was painted whity brown, with an imitation of the cabbage-tree hat; the > bodies were painted, some blue and others red, to represent the shirts: > below the waist was a resemblance of the moleskin trousers, the legs being > covered with reeds, tied all round, to imitate the hide leggings worn in > that district as a protection against the brigalow scrub. These manufactured > whites at once wheeled to the right, fired, and drove the blacks before > them! the latter soon rallied, however, and a desperate fight ensued, the > blacks extending their flanks and driving back the whites. The fictitious > white men bit the cartridges, put on the caps, and went through all the > forms of loading, firing, wheeling their horses, assisting each other, &c.;, > with an exactness which proved personal observation. The native spectators > groaned whenever a black-fellow fell, but cheered lustily when a white bit > the dust; and at length, after the ground had been fought over and over > again, the whites were ignominiously driven from the field, amidst the > frantic delight of the natives, while Eaglehawk worked himself into such a > violent state of excitement that at one time the play seemed likely to > terminate in a real and deadly fight.

Accordingly, the Prussian King was able to assume the title of Emperor.  Starting position and reactions  Since the end of the Austro- Prussian War in 1866 and the foundation of the North German Confederation by Prussia in 1867, the policy for unification had been stalled. As a rule, the southern German states were not affected by the idea of joining the North German Confederation. In this situation, Bismarck wondered how to keep the German question moving. On 7 January 1870, Bismarck discussed his plan with the Prussian Crown Prince Frederick, who had good connections to England. Later, the British Ambassador, who had spoken to the Crown Prince, showed his benevolence, and agreed to make contact with France. As expected, Paris responded with protest. Bismarck had already assumed that his initiative would take a long time.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Band III: Bismarck und das Reich. W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart u.a. 1963, S. 705-708. Surprisingly, the anti-Protestant politician Nepomuk Sepp in the Second Chamber of Bavaria expressed a positive attitude, at least not disagreeing about a German emperor. If it had gone to a new National Assembly like in Frankfurt, he could have also believed in a united Germany. Bismarck received the help of Julius Fr√∂bel with the intention of finding the Kaisertitel, Title of the Emperor, only in Southern Germany and especially in Bavaria, and only then to visit the European level again.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Band III: Bismarck und das Reich. W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart u.a. 1963, S. 708/709. However, the imperial plan was in the shadow of the Hohenzollers' succession in Spain from April 1870. Later, in December during the Franco-Prussian War, the Reichstag approved the request of the Federal Council to include the title of German Emperor in the constitution, and on 18 January 1871, the Prussian King was proclaimed Emperor in Versailles (Imperial Proclamation).  Motives  The Emperor's plan was to rename the Prussian Foreign Office to North German Foreign Office. The question of the further development of the North German Federal Level also emerged. Bismarck's plans for the imperial plan were: * The idea of German unity was ignited * Before the forthcoming governmental debates on the military budget later in 1870, a prestige gain from the King would have been an advantage * The previous title of the Prussian King inf the North German Confederation, presidency, was impractical in diplomatic traffic. At the end of 1870, the Prussian King William was vehemently against the Emperor's title. It was his concern that this title was going to be artificial, surpass the Prussian royal title, and not be recognised by other monarchs.

The battle was fought between the Clan Stewart of Appin and their allies the Clan MacLaren against the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch. Background The Clan MacLaren had made a raid into the Braes of Lochaber and carried off cattle belonging to the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch. The MacDonalds followed after them and caught up with them at Glen Orchy, where, after a sharp skirmish they recovered the cattle. The MacLarens then sought the assistance of their allies the Clan Stewart of Appin who were led by Dugald Stewart. Battle Dugald Steweart instantly raised his men and joined the MacLarens. A battle then took place between the two sides at the Black Mount near the head of Glen Coe. Dugald Stewart, chief of Appin and the chief of the MacDonalds of Keppoch were both killed in the fighting and many were slain on both sides.

He formed his own church, known as the Israelites, a breakaway from the Church of God and Saints of Christ, and led them through a clash with the white Union of South Africa government, which left 163 Israelites dead, 129 wounded and 95 taken prisoner, in what became known as the Bulhoek Massacre. Personal life Enoch Mgijima, the youngest of nine children ‚Äì five girls and four boys, was born in Bulhoek, 25 km southwest of Queenstown to parents Jonas Mayekiso Mgijima and MaKheswa in 1868. His father, a successful farmer, Jonas Mgijima, was among those Mfengu people who accepted land from the British in a buffer zone - Ntabelanga, or Bulhoek - in return for their support. Like many Mfengu families in the area, the Mgijimas adopted British ideas like wearing Western clothing, raising their children as Wesleyan Methodists and sending them to mission schools. Mgijima's brothers studied at Lovedale Institute and Zonnebloem College in Cape Town. Mgijima completed Standard 3 (Grade 5) at a local school but could not go to Lovedale because of severe headaches. He became a Wesleyan lay preacher, hunter and farmer. Work In April 1907, Mgijima had his first vision in which an angel said to him: \\"I have sent you to these people because I am worried that although they worship me, they are not honest in their worship of me. I want you to worship me according to your old traditions.\\" After ignoring the vision, Mgijima began preaching again and acquired a large following as an evangelist. In 1910, after seeing Halley's Comet, Mgijima felt that his vision had been confirmed. To him, this was a sign that God was angry with humans and that they should return to their Old Testament beliefs. In 1912, Mgijima broke away from the Wesleyan Methodist Church and began baptising his followers whom he called the \\"Israelites\\" in the Black Kei River. This came after Mgijima had received a visit from John Isaac Msikinya, a man who had just come back from studying theology and anthropology at Howard University in Washington DC. Msikinya came with an instruction from Pastor William Saunders Crowdy in the United States. Crowdy was a run-away slave, a soldier and the founder of the original Church of God and Saints of Christ ‚Äì the world's oldest black Hebrew denomination. The instruction was that Mgijima should leave the Wesleyan Methodist Church. In November 1912, he joined the Church of God and Saints of Christ, a small church based in the United States of America, observed the Sabbath on Saturday, held services four times a day, and had the Passover in mid-April as their main festival. Towards the end of 1912, Mgijima predicted that the world would end by Christmas and would be followed by 30 days of rain. As a result of his prediction, the Israelites stopped working their fields. However, the end did not come. Over the years his visions became more intense. The Church of God and Saints of Christ asked Mgijima to renounce his visions. When he refused to do so, he was excommunicated. As a result, the church split into two factions ‚Äì the Church of God and Saints of Christ and Mgijima's faction, the Israelites. Mgijima, who had accumulated a large following, stood up at the tabernacle during a church service in 1919 and said \\"Juda, Efrayime, Josef, nezalwane (Judah, Ephraim, Joseph and brethren)\\". According to his followers, Israelites all over the country heard these words and understood that they were to come to Ntabelanga, their prophet's holy village, and await the Lord's coming. By 1921, 3000 Israelites had arrived in Ntabelanga. Bulhoek Massacre In early 1920, local inspector of African locations, Geoffrey Nightingale visited Bulhoek and was reluctant to grant Mgijima permission to host the Passover Festival in the area that year. However, Mgijima assured him his followers would not stay for good. When the inspector visited the village in June, more Israelites had built houses, but Mgijima said many people had not been able to leave for various reasons. Nightingale reluctantly allowed them to stay for a short while. After continuous disagreements over land and the prolonged stay of Israelites in Bulhoek, the white South African government and Mgijima's followers clashed on 24 May 1921. This resulted in 163 Israelites declared dead, 129 wounded and 95 taken prisoner. The massacre is known as the Bulhoek massacre. Mgijima, his elder brother Charles, and Gilbert Matshoba were sentenced to five years hard labour at DeBeer's Convict Station in Kimberley. He was released from prison in 1924 and returned to Bulhoek. Mgijima died on 5 March 1928 at the age of 60, leaving his wife, Tiyiwe Nondzaba, known by her married name \\"Mampumalanga the first\\", and a seven children: Sony, Innis, Zantsi, Mzanywa, Bumba, Topi and Mlauli. Legacy Each year, on 24 May, the religious sect known as the Israelites, founded by Mgijima, host an annual pilgrimage to the grave where the 193 Israelites were buried on 25 May 1921, a day after the massacre. 24 May 2017 marked the 96th anniversary of the massacre. On 3 August 2016, Tsolwana, Inkwanca and Lukhanji local municipalities were amalgamated to form Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality in honour of Enoch Mgijima.

In its own words, the CNI is \\"... a space of unity, reflection and organization of the indigenous peoples of Mexico, promoting the integral reconstitution of the original peoples and the construction of a society in which all cultures, all the colors, all the towns that we are Mexico\\". Since its foundation, among several activities, five national congresses have been held. History =Background= On January 1, 1994, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) rose up in arms after years of organization against dispossession, discrimination and being ignored. They were able to take five municipal headquarters in the states of Chiapas: Chanal, Altamirano,Las Margaritas, Ocosingo and San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, where it communicated the Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle that called on the people of Mexico to join their struggle. After the confrontation between the Mexican army and the EZLN, the people of Mexico took to the streets, stating that the causes of the uprising were just but expressing themselves in favor of peace and a resolution through dialogue. The National Indigenous Congress (CNI), the first nationwide indigenous congress ever held in Mexico, was founded on October 12, 1996, in Mexico City after a call from the EZLN, (Ej√©rcito Zapatista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional) to all indigenous peoples to participate in the Special National Forum on Indigenous Rights and Culture, as a follow-up to the San Andr√©s Accords. There had been indigenous congresses in single states such as San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, Chiapas in 1974. The appearance of the CNI was connected to the failure of the state Mexico to implement the San Andr√©s Accords and a call by the EZLN to participate in a nationwide forum to find a common answer to questions of human rights and indigenous culture. =1st CNI (1996)= Complete declaration (in Spanish) see: I Congreso Nacional Ind√≠gena After the decision to create the CNI in January 1996, the first National Indigenous Congress in Mexico City was convened from October 8‚Äì 12 of the same year. The EZLN received an invitation from the organizers of the event and, despite the climate of conflict generated by the Mexican State since 1994, Comandanta Ramona came as the EZLN representative. She was the first Zapatista to venture outside the borders of Chiapas arriving in the capital of the republic ‚Äî Mexico City. From the Z√≥calo (public square), she announced:\\"I am the first of many steps of the Zapatistas to the Federal District and all the places of Mexico.\\" In this same statement, Ramona spoke for the first time the phrase that is still used as a slogan by the CNI: \\"Never again a Mexico without us!\\" The final declaration of the congress expressed the main areas of agreement in a resolution document containing demands and proposals. These were briefly > ... the recognition of all our social, political and cultural rights for the > affirmation, flourishing and lasting of our communities and peoples. (...) > the immediate and complete fulfillment of the Agreements of the Table 1 on > Indigenous Rights and Culture of the San Andr√©s Dialogue, (...) the > demilitarization of the indigenous areas of the country. \\" As proposals were > briefly outlined \\"Move towards a new Constitution that, with the effective > participation of everyone, will include an inclusive and plural project ... > [and] ... intensify the struggle for the satisfaction of our pending > demands. =2nd CNI (1998)= Complete declaration (in Spanish) see: II Congreso Nacional Ind√≠gena The II National Indigenous Congress was held from October 9‚Äì11, 1998, in the Z√≥calo of Mexico City with the participation of 525 delegates, 102 organizations, 20 states of the Republic, as well as representatives from Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador. During the four days, at seven work tables, there were discussions on: the integral reconstitution of indigenous peoples within the framework of the struggle for self-determination and autonomy framed in the National Consultation for the Recognition of Indigenous Rights and the End of the War of Extermination; the renewal and strengthening of the National Indigenous Congress; and the joint struggle of the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the continent and the world. In the final declaration, proclaimed on October 12, they denounced the exclusion and subjugation that they have suffered, as original peoples, for centuries and that has intensified with globalized neoliberalism. They demonstrated for the fulfillment of the San Andr√©s Accords. They supported and reaffirmed their participation in the National Consultation for the Recognition of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the End of the War of Extermination that was held on March 21, 1999, simultaneously in various parts of Mexico and the world. They called on peoples and civil society to participate in the reconstitution of \\"this homeland of ours\\". =3rd CNI (2001)= Complete declaration (in Spanish) see: III Congreso Nacional Ind√≠gena The III National Indigenous Congress was held in the indigenous community of Nur√≠o, Michoac√°n, from March 2‚Äì4, 2001. The final declaration of the congress denounced militarization in the territory, the persecution of different community organizations and the privatization of natural resources. The constitutional recognition of the Rights of Indian Peoples was emphasized, following the constitutional reform initiative elaborated by the Concord and Pacification Commission, based on the San Andr√©s Accords. They called for the constitutional recognition of their full existence as peoples, their self-determination, their territories and their normative systems. They expressed their support for the March for Indigenous Dignity, which led a Zapatista delegation to Mexico City to speak to the Congress of the Union. On March 28, 2001, four indigenous commanders visited the Legislative Palace of San L√°zaro and spoke to deputies and senators to detail their struggle and demand the approval of the indigenous rights law reforms raised in the San Andr√©s Accords. Part of the speech given by Comandanta Esther in the Legislative Palace of San Lazaro, March 28, 2001, included the following statement: > So here I am, an indigenous woman, in this gallery that is a symbol.

As part of this initiative, and in the context of the ongoing election, the Other Campaign began on January 1, 2006, which was consisted as the tour of Delegate Zero (Subcomandante Marcos) through the 31 States of the Mexican Republic and The Federal District with the aim of listening to the Mexican people. While the campaigns of the established parties just promised, the EZLN, through Delegate Zero, listened and did not preach. On May 5 and 6, 2006, on the peak of The Other Campaign, the National Indigenous Congress held its fourth national meeting in the community of N'donhuani-San Pedro Atlapulco, State of Mexico. Almost 10 years after its founding, the CNI reconvened and decided to support the Other Campaign. In addition, this congress ratified the total repudiation of the attacks of the State on the residents of San Salvador Atenco, as well as the proposals to strengthen the mechanisms of communication and solidarity of the CNI. Finally, a call was made to \\"all indigenous peoples, communities and organizations and all oppressed sectors to form a broad anti-capitalist front that promotes a process leading to a New Constitution and another form of government that allows the recognition of our rights and A fair, free and democratic society.\\" =5th CNI (2016)= Complete declaration (in Spanish) see: V Congreso Nacional Ind√≠gena From the IV CNI, 10 years passed without a national meeting until 2016 when, in the context of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the CNI, the V National Indigenous Congress was convened from 9 to 14 October at the premises of the Indigenous Training Center Integral (CIDECI- UNITIERRA) in the city of San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, Chiapas. This was the first National Indigenous Congress held in Zapatista territory where the celebration for the 20th anniversary was held in the Oventik Caracol on 12 October. The EZLN announcement of the Congress said in part:\\"It is urgent that we bring our flames of resistance, autonomy, and rebellion together. These flames illuminate every original people who weave new worlds that are truly from below, where love and the ancestral commitment to our mother‚Äîthe earth‚Äîare born.\\" The main topics for discussion at this congress were: looting and repression; our resistance and rebellion; balance of the CNI and proposals for the strengthening it. As a proposal for the first stage of the Fifth National Indigenous Congress they declared themselves in permanent assembly to consult in each of the \\"geographies, territories and courses the agreement ... to appoint an 'Indigenous Council of Government \\"whose word is materialized by a woman Indigenous, delegate of the CNI as an independent candidate to fight on behalf of the National Indigenous Congress and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation in the electoral process of 2018 for the presidency of this country\\". During the second stage of the V CNI, the information collected during the consultation was shared with the participation of 523 communities, 25 Mexican states and 43 indigenous peoples. The congress met again, after three months of community consultation in each of the towns and communities that make up the CNI, for the second stage. They met on December 29, 30 and 31, 2016 in San Crist√≥bal and on January 1, 2017, in The Caracol of Oventik. =2017= In the resolution \\"And the earth trembled! A Report from the Epicenter\\" released on January 1, 2017, in Oventik, it was announced that by agreement it was approved to appoint the Indigenous Council of Government \\"that intends to govern the country, with a woman Indigenous of the CNI as spokesperson and independent candidate to the presidency of Mexico in the elections of the year 2018.\\" The goal of the Organization is not only tied to the election campaign, it also aims to increase the level of well-organized communities, tribes and individuals in a nationwide process, because only organization seems to be a worthwhile response to the problems those communities face. Furthermore, having organized the CNI expects an increase in awareness of the issues of displacement, poverty and invisibility, which not only indigenous people suffer in Mexico. In May 2017, the Constituent Assembly of the Indigenous Council of the Government for Mexico met at the Indigenous Center for Integral Training (CIDECI-UNITIERRA) in the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. Among the resolutions issued at the assembly was the appointment of Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Patricio Mart√≠nez as the spokeswoman and indigenous representative as an independent candidacy for the presidential contest of Mexico in 2018.

It stars Noor Hassan, Hina Altaf, Asim Azhar and Hira Salman in lead roles. It is based on the novel of same name by Shaukat Thanvi, written by Khurram Abbas and directed by Ali Masud Saeed. It was dubbed in Pashto under the title ŸÑ€åŸàŸÜÿ¶ and aired on Hum Pashto 1. Story Dr. Khalid (Noor Hassan) is a psychiatrist who has just completed his degree from America and is returning to Pakistan in order to be in his family and to establish a clinic there, When he reaches Pakistan, he decides to travel to his city in a train instead of a plane so that he can see his country properly, for he had been away for so long. In the train, he comes across a bubbly, upbeat and cheerful girl called Gulrukh (Hira Salman) who keeps Dr. Khalid entertained with her funny yet witty jokes. She tells him that his clinic is not going to give him good business since in Pakistan, no one wants to be called a psychic by going to a psychiatric clinic for help. Khalid tells her that he is engaged to his cousin Zubia. Much to Khalid's surprise, Gulrukh guesses a lot about Zubia, such as the fact that she must be a quiet girl who has not studied after her intermediate. Gulrukh tells him that Zubia is not the girl Khalid should marry and he should instead marry someone like herself (Gulrukh). This entertains Khalid. Gulrukh insists that Khalid should take her to his home so that she can show him why she is the perfect match for him, and after a little reluctance, Khalid agrees . They reach Khalid's home and Khalid is greeted warmly by the family members. However, Zubia and her mother are uncomfortable with Gulrukh's presence, though Khalid's mother welcomes her as Khalid's guest. Gulrukh remarks that Zubia is exactly like she imagined her. Meanwhile, an old man (Mehmood Aslam) and a boy (Asim Azhar) are seen seated at a police station. The old man is reporting that his daughter has disappeared and he blames the boy for his daughter's disappearance. This is shown in a comic way instead of showing it as a serious scene. The boy denies having been involved in the disppappearance of the girl. The girl's father gives her picture to the police and the girl turns out to be Gulrukh. Days pass and Zubia gets uncomfortable due to Gulrukh's closeness with Khalid. Gulrukh, after earning Khalid's love, realizes that she has made an enormous mistake by snatching away the innocent Zubi's love from her and in order to correct the situation she wants to leave the house but now Khalid loves her a lot and wants to marry her only. Gulrukh runs away from home when her father and ‚Äúfianc√©,‚Äù Najam come to take her back to Lahore.

Gulrukh is found and it is revealed that she has forgotten both her father and Najam. Khalid wants to give psychological help to Gulrukh. Meanwhile, love starts blossoming between Zubi and Najam when Gulrukh refuses to marry him.

It was contested between a World XI team and Pakistan across three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. Pakistan won the series 2‚Äì1. South Africa's Faf du Plessis captained the World XI team, with Sarfaraz Ahmed leading Pakistan. Ten of the players in the Pakistan squad had not previously played in an international match at home. The World XI side arrived in Lahore a day before the first fixture under high security. The cup was named in commemoration of Pakistan's 70th year of independence. The International Cricket Council (ICC) appointed Richie Richardson as the match referee for the fixtures, the first time the ICC has sent an official to oversee cricket matches in Pakistan since 2009. Aleem Dar, Ahsan Raza, Ahmed Shahab and Shozab Raza were appointed as the on-field umpires. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) introduced the #CricketKiHalalala hashtag for the series. The PCB spent an estimated $3 million to host the three matches, with players on the World XI team being paid approximately $100,000 each. The ICC contributed more than $1 million towards security costs. While attendance for the first two matches were as high as 90%, this was down on the crowd numbers for the final of the 2017 Pakistan Super League. Higher ticket pricing was to blame for the drop in attendance, with some tickets being given to local schools as a result. The ICC and PCB looked at the possibility for further World XI tours to Pakistan in the next two years, with the priority for more Full Member sides to tour. Following the conclusion of the series, Faf du Plessis said how much it meant for the people of Pakistan and that it hopefully will bring cricket back to the country. Sarfraz Ahmed said that he was thankful to the World XI team and that \\"I expect these players to return back to Pakistan with full squads to play a full Test series\\". The ICC congratulated Pakistan for hosting the tournament, with the aim to get bilateral international cricket returning to Pakistan.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History An early trading post was established in what is now Coldwater in 1822. The Chicago Road (now Chicago Street) was constructed through the area in the late 1820s. The village itself was first platted in 1831, and commercial improvements were made almost immediately, with the area that is now this historic district becoming the commercial center of the village. As Coldwater grew, more commercial businesses were established, scattered along the Chicago Road. The establishment of a Michigan Southern depot at the foot of South Monroe Street in 1851 created a concentration of commercial interest in the blocks of Chicago near Monroe. The earliest structures in the downtown were wooden frame buildings. However, a series of major downtown fires in the early 1850s caused the village to mandate masonry construction in the downtown area, beginning in 1854. The building boom continued through the 1870s and 1880s, and many of the remaining buildings in the district date from that time period.

It is situated opposite the former Tetley's Brewery. Salem Chapel, Leeds  History  Built in 1791 by the Rev Edward Parsons, Salem is the oldest surviving non-conformist chapel in Leeds city centre. Salem Chapel is a Grade II listed building and its distinctive curved fa√ßade was added in 1906. The historic chapel was the birthplace of Leeds United Football Club in 1919. Salem‚Äôs hall was the venue for a public meeting in which Leeds City F.C. was disbanded over financial misdemeanours, and Leeds United F.C. was formed. The chapel was closed as a place of worship in 2001. The psychologist and writer Reverend Harry Guntrip preached the last sermon.  Present  In 2009, the building was purchased by Professor Adam Beaumont, founder of telecommunications company aql. Beaumont funded the renovation and restoration of the chapel, which now houses aql‚Äôs head offices, as well as data centres, an exhibition space, a bar and a 370-seat glass-floored auditorium. On 17 November 2011, Salem Chapel was awarded a blue plaque by the Leeds Civic Trust in recognition of its architectural and religious significance. The plaque was unveiled by the Lord Mayor of Leeds, Councillor Rev‚Äôd Alan Taylor. As of April 2018, Salem Chapel is also home to the Estonian Consulate for the North of England and the Isle of Man.  Auditorium  Salem Chapel is often used to host the launch of Government initiatives. In February 2015, Salem Chapel hosted then-Prime Minister David Cameron and then- Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne for talks as part of the government's Northern Powerhouse proposal. Osborne returned to Salem Chapel in February 2017 with Lord Jim O'Neill to launch the inaugural Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) report. In January 2018, it was used to launch Transport for the North's Strategic Transport Plan to transform transportation in the North of England over the next 30 years.

Biography  Heusch attended the Medical Schools at the Universities of D√ºsseldorf and Bonn, where he graduated in 1979 and received his MD degree in 1980. Following obligatory military service as medical officer, he was postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Physiology at the University of D√ºsseldorf Medical School where he completed his PhD in 1985. From 1985 to 1986 Heusch was research cardiologist at the University of California, San Diego under the mentorship of Dr. John Ross Jr. From 1986 to 1989 Heusch held a Heisenberg scholarship from the German Research Foundation in the Department of Physiology and the Clinic of Cardiology (Prof. Dr. Franz Loogen) at the University of D√ºsseldorf Medical School. Since 1989 he is professor and chair of the Institute for Pathophysiology at the University of Essen Medical School. From 1999 to 2000 he spent a sabbatical in the Department of Physiology at the University of Southern Alabama, Mobile where he is adjunct professor since. Since 2014 Heusch is scientific chief executive of the West German Heart and Vascular Center Essen. Heusch served as president of the European Section of the International Society for Heart Research from 2002 to 2005 and as president of the German Cardiac Society from 2007 to 2009. As president of the German Cardiac Society Heusch put particular emphasis on the establishment of Chest Pain Units to fight myocardial infarction ‚Äì today there are more than 250 Chest Pain Units in Germany. From 2008 to 2016 Heusch served on the medical review board of the German Research Foundation, from 2012 to 2016 as its speaker.

Research  Heusch‚Äôs research focus is on coronary blood flow and the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. He first reported that the coronary circulation is not maximally dilated during myocardial ischemia, but subject to active vasoconstriction through alpha-adrenergic effects of the sympathetic innervation. He characterized in detail the hemodynamic, morphological, metabolic and molecular features of hibernating myocardium and of coronary microembolization. In recent years, he analyzed the signal transduction of ischemic conditioning. The translation of preclinical data to clinical practice is of particular importance to him, and he succeeded to translate remote ischemic conditioning to patients undergoing bypass surgery. Heusch published more than 600 original and review articles in respected international journals , his h-index is triple digit. http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ Seven collaborators of Heusch received the habilitation degree, his long-term collaborator Rainer Schulz is professor and chair of the Department of Physiology at the University of Giessen Medical School since 2011, his long-term collaborator Bodo Levkau is professor and chair of the Institute of Molecular Medicine of the University of D√ºsseldorf Medical School since 2020, his long-term collaborator Petra Kleinbongard is professor for cardioprotection at the University of Duisburg-Essen Medical School since 2020.

She was best known as the mother of the Philippines‚Äô national hero Jose Rizal. Realonda was born in Santa Cruz, Manila. She was also known for being a disciplinarian and hard- working mother. Her medical condition inspired Rizal to take up medicine.  Early life  She was the second child of Brijida de Quintos and Lorenzo Realonda, a municipal captain in Bin√°n, Laguna. She was also a representative in the Spanish Courts and a solid Catholic, being a Knight of the Order of Isabela by profession. Quintos was an educated woman, who became a housewife, devoted to caring for her family's needs. Her family adopted ‚ÄúRealonda‚Äù after General Governor Narciso Claver√≠a issued a decree in 1849. Realonda came from a financially able family and studied at the Colegio de Santa Rosa in Manila, just like her mother who was well-bred and had an educational background in the subjects of mathematics and literature.  Personal life  Teodora married Francisco Mercado, a native of Bi√±√°n, Laguna, when she was 20 years old. The couple resided in Laguna, particularly in Calamba and built a business from agriculture. She was an industrious and educated woman, managing the family's farm and finances. Teodora used her knowledge to grow the rice, corn, and sugarcane that sustained the family's well-to-do lifestyle. She also expanded the family business into the areas of textiles, flour, and sugar milling, refining these raw materials and selling the finished staples from a small store on the ground floor of the family home. Teodora had eleven children with Francisco. They are Saturnina, Paciano, Narcisa, Olympia, Lucia, Maria, Jos√©, Concepcion, Josefa, Trinidad and Soledad. All her children were sent to study in different colleges in Manila, but only Jose was sent to Europe ‚Äì as he was inspired to study medicine, particularly ophthalmology, to help his mother due to her failing eyesight. Jos√© honored his mom in Memoirs of a Student in Manila, writing, \\"After God, the mother is everything to man.\\"  Dispute against the Spanish and exile After moving to Europe, Jose became too involved in speaking his mind against Spanish authorities. Teodora became an easy target and was imprisoned for two and a half years, and was charged of poisoning her brother's wife. She was released after being backed up by famous lawyers of her time. She was made to walk 50 kilometers for not using her Hispanic last name ‚ÄúRealonda de Rizal‚Äù . Her family was also forced to leave Calamba after losing a land dispute versus Dominicans. She later moved to Hong Kong with Rizal in 1891 and stayed in a home in Dapitan where her son was sentenced and in exile.  After Rizal's death  In August 1898, Narcisa got the body of her brother Rizal, and found out that the body was not even laid out in a coffin. Because of this, the government offered a lifetime pension as a token of gratitude, after Rizal was declared the national hero of the Philippines. Teodora even saw the declaration of the monument for Rizal a week before she died. Alonso died in her home in San Fernando Street, Binondo, Manila.

It was lost in the launch failure of PSLV-C39 on August 31, 2017. Overview IRNSS-1H was India's first satellite to be assembled, integrated and tested by private firms under ISRO supervision and was intended to replace the failed IRNSS-1A and complete the NAVIC constellation of geosynchronous navigation satellites which is a ‚Çπ1420-crore independent regional navigation satellite system developed by India. Payload: *Navigation payload in S band and L5 band, dual Helix Array Antenna (1.1 m diameter) *CDMA ranging payload in C band *Rubidium Atomic Frequency Standard *Corner Cube Retro Reflector for Laser Ranging Propulsion: Conventional bipropellant system with Mono Methyl Hydrazine as fuel and Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen (MON-3) as oxidizer. *Twelve 22N thrusters. *One 440N Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) *Two 390 litres propellant tanks *One 67 litre pressurant tank with CFRP overwrap and Titanium liner. Launch PSLV-C39 carrying IRNSS-1H was using XL variant of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on its forty-first flight. Launch occurred as scheduled at 19:00 IST or 13:30 UTC, 31 August 2017 from Second Launch Pad of SDSC (SHAR) aiming for orbit of 284 √ó 20,650 km (Sub GTO) with 19.2¬∞ inclination. Vehicle performed initial flight sequences as planned but 203 seconds into flight, the payload fairing jettison event was not accomplished. Excluding this mid-flight malfunction, rest of the planned flight sequences including spacecraft separation at 17 minutes and 56 seconds occurred nominally but due to extra 1182 kg mass of fairing, target orbit could not be achieved leaving the combined assembly of PSLV upper-stage (PS4), enclosed payload fairing and trapped IRNSS-1H spacecraft in 167.4 √ó 6554.8 km orbit with 19.18¬∞ inclination. Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) of IRNSS-1H was fired to help it come out of the payload fairing and to consume the propellants and passivate the spacecraft. PSLV payload fairing or heatshield Prior to PSLV C39 / IRNSS-1H, last launch failure involving a PSLV happened 24 years ago in 1993, following which many variants of PSLV rockets have had 39 successful launches. Cause of failure PSLV-C39 payload fairing separation mechanism consisted of horizontal and vertical jettisoning system. At the scheduled time during flight separation command was issued and the horizontal jettisoning system functioned nominally but the vertical jettisoning system malfunctioned and subsequently two halves of the payload fairing could not move apart. The cause of malfunction was identified as non-initiation of detonation in pyro device of vertical jettisoning system. Orbit decay Combined assembly of PSLV fourth stage, payload fairings and enclosed IRNSS-1H spacecraft within it weighed between 2675 to 3480 kg and re-entered Earth's atmosphere around 19:23 UTC on 2 March 2019 over Vanuatu.

History The Ascension Church was built in 1872 in Koisug village of Don Host Oblast (now it is situated within the territory of Bataysk town). It belonged to Ekaterinoslav Diocese. The church was wooden, with plinth being built of brick. It had five domes: one big and four small ones. The bell tower of the Ascension church was completely built of brick. According to data of the Economic Department of Holy Synod, as of 1910, the church had a Sunday school, a lodge, a priest's house and ancillary facilities. In the 1930s, the Ascension Church was closed and destroyed. Only the first tier of the bell tower had been preserved. In 1989, an Orthodox community of the Ascension Church was registered in Bataysk. In 1990 the restoration of the Ascension church on the project of Boris Vinnikov (in the style of Moscow-Yaroslavl architecture of the 17th century) began in the territory of the former church garden. On November 4, 1995, the first liturgy was served in the new church. Over time, a bell tower was erected, utility rooms were built, and the churchyard was arranged. In 2006, the parish purchased new bells and constructed a belfry. Restoration works were finished in 2006, and on September 5 of the same year the Ascension Church was consecrated.

It stands at the junction of Conway Road and Romilly Crescent and has been a Grade II Listed Building since 1975. It is the largest Methodist chapel still in use in Cardiff. History The church began life in 1859, located in a much plainer building on nearby Romilly Road. In the 1860s, the decision was taken to move to larger premises, and the original building was sold off. It was bought by Congregationalists, though is now in use by the Plymouth Brethren. Architects Habershon & Pite designed the replacement building: a large construction with two spires, which was markedly grander than many other Nonconformist chapels in Cardiff at the time. Its construction was aided by a ¬£700 donation from Lewis Davies, a wealthy coal magnate. Despite its large size, rising congregation numbers prompted extension of the structure shortly after the first build was finished, with transepts and an apse being installed. The completed building of 1871 had a seating capacity of 1100. Whilst many Nonconformist chapels in Cardiff had mixed fortunes, Conway Road thrived, with a large and prosperous congregation. In 1893, the church was so wealthy that it was able to open the John Wesley Centenary School for the use of its Sunday Scholars. This building had a capacity of 700 and also had its own cricket field and tennis courts. On 8 July 1915, the church was severely damaged by a fire which all but destroyed its original roof. The pulpit, however survived on account of its being made from stone. The damage was repaired, with the Arts and Crafts roof being replaced in the Neo-Georgian style. The present stained glass dates predominantly from the 1920s, and the organ from 1920. The church continued to prosper through the Great Depression; by the 1930s, it had a Sunday School of 900, which required 100 teachers. In 1968, the Sunday school building of 1893 was sold to the Urdd Gobaith Cymru. Its facilities were replaced by alterations made to the basement and rear of the church. It has since been demolished and is now covered by apartments. Grade II listed status came in 1975. Recent Events The church is part of the Conway Road Conservation Area. Although its congregation numbers are no longer as robust as they were in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, the church continues to play an active role in the community.

In his hometown, our hero (Jai Jagadish) develops a crush on the beautiful Chelvi (Shubha), an innocent village belle, whose adoration, he mistakes as love. When she is married off by her family, he turns to his college friend, the glamorous Chanchala (Vaishali) for solace. Chanchala, a rich girl who pilots her own plane for a hobby, befriends our hero only because he is a successful football player at the college level. When he suffers a leg injury that kills his chances of competing at the state level, she breaks up with him. After finishing college, our hero takes up a bank job and once again mistakes the friendly overtures of his colleague Sarla (Padma Kumata) a simple middle-class girl. When she clarifies her feelings to be platonic, he is disillusioned and agrees to go in for an arranged marriage with Sheela (Aarathi). How the level-headed Sheela makes him understand the true meaning of love forms the second half of this avant-garde film. The haunting melody 'Love Endare' sung by Vani Jairam was widely popular. Amrish Puri and Aruna Irani feature in a song sequence in cameo appearances. The movie abounds in symbolisms. Right from the names. The hero first mistakes beauty (Chelvi) is love, then attraction that is fickle (Chanchala) is love and next friendship that is simple (Sarla). Finally he realizes love is in the conduct (Sheela). A bullock cart is used as the symbol for the rustic Chelvi, a helicopter for Chanchala and an auto for Sarla.

The museum is perhaps most famous for at one point housing a pair of mummies as well as sheets of papyri (which supposedly formed the basis for parts of the Book of Abraham) that had once belonged to Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith.

According to Perry R. Duis, the museum was Chicago's version of Barnum's American Museum (which was located in New York City from 1841 until it burned in 1865).Duis (1998), p. 206. This incarnation of Wood's Museum contained a plethora of bizarre and interesting items that visitors could see for only a quarter, including: around sixty cases of birds, insects, and assorted reptiles; a panorama of London; many model ships; paintings of Indians; a rifle owned by Daniel Boone; a scale model of the Parthenon; the \\"Great Zeuglodon\\" (a 96-foot-long skeleton of a Basilosaurus); and a pair of mummies with sheets of papyri that had once belonged to Joseph Smith (founder of the Latter Day Saint movement).Todd (1992).Ritner (2013), p. 62.Ritner (2013), p. 66. Col. Wood's Museum burned to the ground during the Great Chicago Fire, and all of its contents were lost. Nevertheless, a week after the conflagration, Wood leased the Globe Theatre (which was located just outside the main downtown district) and began the long march towards reopening. After several years of preparations and collecting, Wood's museum was finally ready for visitors in 1875; this version too was stocked with bizarre finds, and Wood charged a quarter to visitors. The museum took up the second through fourth floors of the theater building. In 1877, this version was also destroyed by a fire, but Wood once again reopened it in 1884. He ran this final version out of the Olympia Theatre building, which he leased; a restaurant that had been operating on the main floor was retained, and Wood devoted the remaining four floors to showcasing novelties.

These services are typically provided by a city or regional government, public emergency hospital, or the Disaster Medical Service. The emergency number for dialing an ambulance in Russia is 03 or the generic European 112.  Overview  = Staffing = An ambulance is composed of any combination of doctors, nurses and feldshers (a combination of a physicians assistant and paramedic), with ambulance drivers selected from an agency that trains them as professional drivers. Ambulances are staffed at minimum by a nurse and feldsher. The driver‚Äôs task is only driving and does not have any medical qualifications or even specialized driver's training.  System configuration  = Ambulance Types = ; Class 1 : A non-emergency patient transport vehicle used to shuttle patients between hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities. ; Class 2 : A generic emergency ambulance staffed with feldshers trained and operating in Basic Life Support (BLS). ; Class 3 : Specialty Ambulance. In addition to the basic ambulance teams, various types of specialty units can respond, depending on what advanced patient care is needed. The most common is a \\"reanimobil\\", or a \\"resuscitation ambulance\\". These are Advanced Life Support (ALS) units that respond to cardiac arrest, stroke, severe trauma, and other severe medical emergencies. Other types of specialty ambulances include cardiac, surgical, OB, pediatric, intensive care, and respiratory. All of these units carry state-of-the-art equipment, a specialty emergency physician, and some combination of a feldsher and nurse. These specialty ambulances are typically painted yellow to distinguish them from the generic white emergency ambulances. = Other Emergency Services = ; Rescue Service : –ê technical rescue brigade provided by a city or regional government or EMERCOM depending on location. These units respond to motor vehicle accidents, building collapses, water rescues, and rope rescue situations. The teams extricate or rescue the victim from the dangerous situation, stabilize the victim, and hand them over to the ambulance.

He played a leading role in the right-wing Action Fran√ßaise movement before World War I (1914‚Äì18). He enrolled in the army during the war and was killed in action. Early years (1873‚Äì1901) L√©on Odon Marie Anatole de Montesquiou-Fezensac was born on 14 July 1873 in Briis-sous-Forges, Seine-et-Oise. His father was an officer and had married a francophile woman of the high Romanian nobility, Princess Marie Bibesco, whose father he had known during the campaigns of the Empire. He was raised in the family chateau of Courtanvaux until the age of ten, then was sent to the Stanislas Catholic school in Paris. After graduating he entered the √âcole de Droit, and at the same time studied violin at the Conservatoire. Montesquiou performed his military service as a private soldier from 13 November 1894 to 24 September 1895 in the 115th Infantry Regiment, and was in one of the units designated to witness the degradation of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. He exercised with the 103rd Infantry Regiment in 1897, 1901, 1903 and 1905. He was always rated very well, and advanced steadily in rank, becoming a sub-lieutenant of the reserve in 1900. He obtained his bachelor's degree and then in 1899 wrote his doctoral thesis on the suppression of duelling. He enrolled at the bar but never pleaded. On 20 June 1899 Montesquiou attended the first public meeting organized by the committee of the Action Fran√ßaise at the Salle des Agriculteurs, and publicly support the organization that evening. From then on he was in constant correspondence with Maurras, to whom the adherence of the well-born young man was important. In 1900 he joined the Ligue de la patrie fran√ßaise, but then moved over to the Action fran√ßaise due to his exchanges with Maurras. His only reservation about the movement was that France was still proudly Republican, far from monarchist. He contributed to the revue grise from 1900, writing firmly nationalistic articles that were later collected into books such as Le Salut public (1901) and La Raison d'√âtat (1902). Action Fran√ßaise (1901‚Äì15) Montesquiou was definitely converted to the royalist cause in August 1901. He was one of the few members of the old aristocracy to play a leading role in the Action Fran√ßaise movement. He became an increasingly important member of the movement. In September 1902 he was put in charge of the notes de quinzaine in the Action fran√ßaise review. By the end of December 1902 was chairman of the board of Action fran√ßaise review, which had just been incorporated as a public limited company. He then organized a successful conference in Marseille followed by a series of conferences in the provinces from 1903 onward. He became one of the best and most active speakers of the movement. In January 1905 he became Secretary General of the new Ligue d'Action fran√ßaise. Montesquiou was among the many early members of the Action Fran√ßaise who were practicing Catholics, and included the art historian Louis Dimier and the essayist Bernard de V√©sins. They helped Charles Maurras (1868‚Äì1952) develop the royalist league's pro-Catholic policies. In February 1906 Montesquiou launched the Institut d'Action Fran√ßaise, where he held the \\"Auguste Comte\\" chair. He wrote three books on Comte and positivism based on his lectures and conferences. In his Le syst√®me politique d'Auguste Comte √† la Nouvelle librairie nationale (1907) Montesquiou tried to show the disciples of Comte could get along with Catholics. In 1910 he was elected a member of the Comtistes. The decision of the Court of Cassation on 12 July 1906 to annul the conviction of Captain Dreyfus caused a renewed surge of anti-Drefusism among the Action fran√ßaise, with Montesquiou playing a leading role. The League denounced the decision, and violently attacked General Georges Picquart, the new Minister of War. In April 1907 Montesquiou was officially informed by the Ministry of War that a report on his activity in the Action fran√ßaise had been filed in his dossier as an officer. On 26 April 1907 Le Gaulois published his open letter to Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau in which he responded to the report by saying he would again put up posters against the rehabilitation of Dreyfus and Picquart. On 16 May 1907 he was suspended from his duties as a reserve officer for one year. Montesquiou held a meeting of 5,000 supporters two days later. Following an inquiry he was dismissed from his rank and employment in the army on 3 September 1907. He continued to campaign against the Drefusards. Montesquiou wrote that the Action Francaise was born from the Dreyfus Affair. In July 1909 he wrote, \\"We have one goal: Order through the restoration of the King. Well, if this restoration necessitates opposition to the law, violence, and coup de force, we are ready.\\" During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Montesquiou was assigned as lieutenant to the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment. He fought in eastern France and in Champagne. He died at Souain, Marne, on 25 September 1915 when leading his section in an assault. He was decorated with the Croix de Guerre. Montesquiou became part of the pantheon of martyrs of the Action Fran√ßaise. Jean Baffier was commissioned in 1916 to produce a bust of Montesquiou for the editorial offices of the Action Fran√ßaise. However, his preliminary model was rejected, and the sculptor was forced to consider a suit for breach of contract.

The race is arranged along with the celebration of Independence Day of the Republic of Indonesia. Pacu Jalur is the largest annual festival for the Kuantan Singingi district community, especially in the capital district of Taluk Kuantan located along the Kuantan river. This traditional event that has been passed down in Kuantan Singingi regency since hundreds of years ago, the culture has been held by the people of Kuansing until now.festival pacu jalur kuansing accessdate August 2017 Pacu Jalur is a long boat rowing race, just like dragon boat race in Malaysia and Singapore. Dance program at Pacu Jalur History The history of the Pacu line begins in the 17th century. At the time the dug-outs or Jalur were used as a means of transport along the Kuantan river from the Kuantan Hulu at the source of the river all the way down to the Cerenti sub-district at the mouth of the Kuantan river. As ground transportation was not yet developed during that time, the route was actually used as an important means of transport for villagers, mainly used as a means of transporting crops, such as bananas and sugar cane, and serves to transport about 40-60 people. Later, these dug-out boats are painted or given decorations that include heads of snakes, crocodiles, tigers and sometimes added with umbrellas. In time its function shifted from being a mere transport means for the people, it became a splendid royal barge. This water-route gradually transformed from a means of transportation to part of social identity. According to the historical record of the path began in Rantau Kuantan around the late 17th century, the beginning of the path is also used as welcoming honorable guests such as kings, sultans who visit to Rantau Kuantan. Since 1905 this turned into race and known as Pacu Jalur. During the Dutch colonial rule Pacu Jalur was held to enliven the traditional celebrations, festivities of the people and to commemorate the birthday of the queen of the Netherlands Wihelmina that fell on 31 August. The festival used to start on 31 August to 1 or 2 September during Dutch era. Pacu Jalur celebration was contested for 2‚Äì3 days, depending on the number of tracks that follow. It was also an event to commemorate the big days of Muslims such as Maulud Prophet, Idul Fitri or New Year Muharam.

The rowing race According to the language of the local population, Jalur means Boat. Before the main event of \\"Pacu Jalur 'is started, it usually held entertainment performances like singing and dancing performances to entertain all participants and surrounding communities. Nowadays, prior to the festival, smaller rowing events were held in four districts, followed by a traditional mini route held at Tepian Narosa Teluk Kuantan. The racetrack follows the flow of Batang Kuantan River, with a track length of about 1 km marked by six piles. The wooden boat those take part in the competition usually have a length of 25 to 40 meters and the width of the middle section of approximately 1.3 ms / d 1.5 m. The crew for each boat varies from 50 to 60 people. Each of the crew has his own task, there is the commander who shouts out instructions, the helmsman, another one leads the boat by dancing from left to right, while another provides the \\"music\\" to provide rhythm and ensure regularity to rowers. All these are in order that the boat moves fast forward in the right direction, provide balance, and rowers follow the same rhythm.

Early life The surname Proudlock is common in Coquetdale and the surrounding region, and the forename Lewis is common in that family. He was born in Elsdon, to a poor family. He had very little formal schooling, lasting only three months, at a school in Elsdon Woodside, funded by the Rector of Elsdon. He started work in a local landsale coal mine at the age of 7. In 1869, he was living in Whitfield, in the south of the county, a lead mining region. He continued working in mining until after 1871, when the census records him as an ironstone miner. In the late 1870s the birth records of his children show he was living in Dinnington, and his obituary states that he worked as a coal miner there. Author and Musician In 1869, while living in Whitfield, he had published \\"Poems and Songs\\", a small volume of poetry. It was favourably reviewed, and two of the poems printed, in the Newcastle Courant.Newcastle Courant, 3 September, 3 and 10 December 1869. Recovered from British Newspaper Archive. One of these poems, \\"A Dirge\\" was written in memory of his namesake, probably a relative, Lewis Proudlock (1801-1826), himself a published poet.The Posthumous Poetical Works of Lewis Proudlock, published by Walter Eaton, Jedburgh, 1826. In 1881, his census record shows that he gave his profession as \\"Teacher of Dancing and Author of Fiction and Poetry\\". In the local press, there were regular advertisements for his dancing classes and the associated balls, as well as accounts of other events where he played, from 1882 to 1887. He also advertised offering to provide dance music for events on violin or violins, cornet and violoncello. In 1881, he acquired from a Mr. Fish, of Angerton, near Hartburn, a manuscript written by one John Smith, dated 1753. Twenty tunes from this were copied by John Stokoe for the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries; these include the earliest known version of \\"The Keel Row\\", an elaborate fiddle variation set, as well as some fiddle settings of what seem to be Border pipe tunes. Unfortunately, the manuscript itself now seems to be lost. One dance tune, still widely played, is called \\"Proudlock's Hornpipe\\", or occasionally \\"Lewis Proudlock's Hornpipe\\". It has strong similarities to an 18th century tune Belleisle's March, or the Monk's March, and there is no suggestion that Proudlock composed it; rather, its association with him probably dates from his activities as a dancing master and violinist. He is known to have owned a set of 18th century Border pipes, which had belonged to his relative Muckle Jock Milburn; these are now in the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum. This catalogue entry erroneously describes Lewis as being Muckle Jock's grandson; while his mother was a Milburn, she was not Muckle Jock's daughter. In the same period, he also wrote two novels, \\"The Shepherd of the Beacon, or the Hero of the Khyber\\", dated by the British Library at 1877, whose action is based in Coquetdale, and later, \\"Crimson Hand, the Scourge of the Bushrangers: or, The Oath Redeemed\\", with action moving between Coquetdale and Australia; Proudlock refers to both books in an advertisement in 1882,Morpeth Herald, 18 November 1882 so this too must have been published before this time . Both novels were published in Hexham. In 1887 he placed many advertisements offering the services of a dance band, so it is likely that at this time much of his working life was still based on music; from then on, there is little evidence of professional musical activity. It is unclear whether he was continuing to work as a miner during this period. He was the owner of a set of Border pipes, which had belonged to Muckle Jock Milburn. In this catalogue entry, he is described as Muckle Jock's grandson. However, although his mother was Jane Milburn, she was not Muckle Jock's daughter; nonetheless it is probable they were related. As the Cocks collection of bagpipes, which included this item, was assembled after Proudlock's death, it is unsurprising that this detail was garbled. There is no evidence that Proudlock was himself a piper. From the late 1880s he seems to have returned completely to mining, working in particular at Stobswood Colliery, near Ulgham until his retirement. He was active in the Miners' Association, serving as a delegate for pits where he worked, and at times on the executive of the union. Later life In about 1896, he published a second volume of poems, \\"Borderland Muse\\", which as well as including poems evoking the landscape and nature of Northumberland, also include an extended cycle of narrative poems about a fire below ground in a coal mine, and a poem \\"The Charge of the Household Brigade at Kassassin\\", commemorating an action in which his younger brother Jaspar was severely wounded. The book was dedicated to the Duke of Teck, and Proudlock expresses gratitude to HRH Princess Mary of Teck for her patronage - it seems likely that she assisted him with the cost of publication. He seems to have had a considerable reputation locally as a poet, already being mentioned by name in a toast to \\"our local poets\\" at a Burns Supper as early 1871, while The Borderland Muse was praised, shortly after its publication, by another pitman poet, James Atchison, in a letter to the Durham County Advertiser Durham County Advertiser, 11 September 1896, recovered from the British Newspaper Archive. Atchison also included a poem of his own in response. In 1911, he moved away from Stobswood, and much of his property was auctioned. In a short notice on the death of his wife, he is referred to specifically as the author of The Borderland Muse, and it is noted there that the work describes life both in the border country and in the pits. As this was more than 15 years after the work's publication, his reputation cannot have been short-lived. It is also stated there that at this time he was living in retirement in Morpeth. Death He died in Morpeth on 4 September 1914. He was given an extended obituary in the Morpeth Herald, headlined \\"Death of Lewis Proudlock, Novelist and Poet\\", where he was described as \\"One of the most remarkable and versatile men produced among the miners of Northumberland\\". Another article in the same issue of this paper referred to \\"his ceaseless craving for the acquisition of knowledge\\", and stated that he had acquired \\"a tolerable library for a man in his position\\". That was almost certainly an understatement, as the sale of some of his property in 1911 included a 16 volume encyclopedia.

Description Vigna trilobata is an annual or perennial legume. It has reddish stems, glabrous or rarely pubescent, which are prostrate and trailing (rarely weakly twining) to . The leaves are trifoliolate, on petioles long, with leaflets ovate in outline that are long and wide. The leaves are also glabrous to sub-glabrous and usually shiny. The stipules are peltate, sometimes spurred, and are ovate, long. The inflorescence is a few-flowered raceme, with the peduncle being long, the pedicels long, and the calyx long and glabrous, with minute teeth. The corolla is yellow and 5‚Äì7 mm long. The pods are cylindrical, long and wide, from glabrous to sparingly pubescent with short adpressed hairs, and are black when ripe.Ali, 1977; Saldanha and Nicolson, 1976 Habitat and Ecology Vigna trilobata is mostly found on well-drained, alkaline, dark, cracking clay soils, but also on sandy and loamy soils of similar reaction and can rarely be found on poorly drained soils. One of its major features is its strong resistance to drought, though the seeds shatter in frost. It is also moderately tolerant of salinity.Keating, B.A., Strickland, R.W. and Fisher, M.J. (1986). Salt tolerance of some tropical pasture legumes with potential adaptation to cracking clay soils. Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture, 26, 181-186 Under well-watered conditions, flowering and seed set is continuous but sparse. However, under moisture stress, plants respond with more dense flowering, far greater seed production and a reduction in vegetative growth. The annual rainfall at areas where Vigna trilobata grows ranges from . The species is native to a largely tropical area extending from 24¬∫N in India to 9¬∫S in Indonesia, and from near sea level to greater than above sea level, mostly equating to average annual temperatures around . It is tolerant of regular or constant heavy grazing, but not of infrequent heavy grazing when a bulk of foliage is rapidly removed.Jain, H.K. and Mehra, K.L.

His plants were some of the first European species to be shipped to Australia when the British colony was founded. Life and family Born with a twin brother John, who died young, they were the fourth and fifth children of Hugh Ronalds Snr and Mary n√©e Clarke. His younger brother Francis was the father of inventor Sir Francis Ronalds. Hugh married his cousin Elizabeth Clarke and had ten children. The family held Unitarian beliefs and Hugh served as a trustee and treasurer of the Boston Chapel (now the Brentford Free Church) in Boston Manor Road, which his father and others had founded. He lived all his life in an Elizabethan house adjacent to the vicarage of St Lawrence's church on Brentford High Street, and his youngest son Robert died in the same house in 1880. The home‚Äôs contents were then shipped to Hugh‚Äôs only great-grandchild Lucy Harris n√©e Ronalds in London, Ontario, and much survives today in the Eldon House museum and the University of Western Ontario archives. Ronalds Nursery Hugh Ronalds Snr had established a nursery in Brentford in the late 1750s, at the same time that his friend William Aiton began to create what became the Kew Gardens on the opposite bank of the Thames. The two gardens benefited from their close relationship over many years. Hugh and his older brother Henry Clarke Ronalds inherited the nursery on their father's death, with Hugh undertaking most of the management. He continued the steady expansion Hugh Snr had begun and by the time of his death had acquired nursery grounds at Brentford Butts; Brentford End (incorporating the former home of Attorney- general William Noy); Isleworth; Blondin/Niagara Streets, Northfields; Little Ealing; and East Bedfont, to supplement the home nursery near St Lawrence's. Three of his sons entered the business ‚Äì Hugh Clarke, John and Robert. John took on proprietorship of the nursery after Hugh's death, and Robert‚Äôs decease later brought the firm to an end. One of the other horticulturalists who had received training at the nursery was Dr Robert Hogg. The nursery's clients included the Duke of Northumberland (who held nearby Syon House); the Clitherow family at Boston Manor; the Duke of Devonshire at Chiswick House; Robert Child at Osterley Park; and, further afield, the Duke of Buccleuch at Dalkeith Palace in Scotland. Capability Brown also purchased plants from the nursery. =Plant import and export= Always seeking to increase their array of nursery stock, the family imported little-known plants from overseas and shared specimens with the Kew Gardens, the Horticultural Society's garden and its members, and various estates around the country. They also exported specimens around the world. Sir Joseph Banks asked Hugh to provide seeds, plants and trees for the new colony in Australia and gardeners tended them on their long journey there. The ships used included (1789) and (1799 and 1800). Hugh also supplied trees for William Bligh's second breadfruit voyage to Australia, Tahiti and the West Indies in 1791 in and other plants later travelled to New Zealand. =Plant breeding= The family were active horticultural scientists. In his youth, Hugh created a herbarium as part of his studies and some of his original specimens survive today in the botanical volumes on display in Eldon House. Both Hugh and his son John were elected Fellows of the Horticultural Society and published papers on their work. The Horticultural Society leased part of Hugh's nursery ground at Little Ealing for a short time as their experimental garden. Apples were long a specialism of the nursery and, by the late 1820s, the fruit of over 300 cultivars in their orchards was on display. Renowned horticultural author John Claudius Loudon urged Hugh to publish his research findings. The book was published in 1831, beautifully illustrated by lithographs prepared by his daughter Elizabeth (known as Betsey). It was dedicated to the 3rd Duke of Northumberland and was very well received in the literature. =Cemetery landscaping and planting= In a further illustration of the range of their business, the Ronalds family landscaped and planted at least two of the large commercial cemeteries established in the 19th century - the Kensal Green Cemetery in West London and the London Road Cemetery at Coventry.

The daughter of actress Doriel Paget, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in World War II and later became part of Fitzrovia's literary scene, establishing friendships with several writers. After modelling on the Paris and London catwalks and working as a producer's secretary, Valery began a career in acting in 1949 but was unable to establish a career in this field and turned to presenting on television for the BBC and Associated-Rediffusion. She operated a secondhand shop by the late 1960s and wrote two volumes of autobiography at the encouragement of her partner Robin Jacques. Valery also wrote television scripts for soap operas and her career saw progression when the BBC asked her to write for the drama show Angels. There she met fellow writer Jill Hyem and the two were commissioned by the BBC to write episodes for Tenko. Valery later wrote the 1986 drama series Ladies in Charge. She was known as an ardent feminist and was an outspoken member of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain. Biography =Early life and education= She was born Anne Firth on 24 February 1926 in Hampstead, London. She was the daughter of singer and actress Doriel Paget while her father Colin was not present in her life. Valery had a dislike of schools; she attended four of them with one being a finishing school and was incorrectly diagnosed as dyslexic. Just before she turned 18, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, and was taught in commando tactics such as parachute jumping behind enemy lines and twisting a bayonet to cause the maximum amount of injury. Valery later became employed as a secretary for the United States Army before joining the intelligence unit of the British Army. She could not put the skills she learned into practice when she became aware of the Surrender of Japan. After the war, Valery became part of the literary Fitzrovia scene and established friendships with several writers. She meet the Greek poet Nanos Valaoritis and the two married soon after. Valery adopted a derivative version of his surname, and the two rented a flat in Chelsea. She gave birth to a son who died at the age of five and the marriage was later dissolved. =Career= She modelled on the catwalks of Paris and London before finding work as a producer's secretary at the BBC. Valery's acting career began in 1949 by winning a role in the Sid Field comedy Cardboard Cavalier, and portrayed the mistress of Ascoyne D'Ascoyne (Alec Guinness) in Kind Hearts and Coronets that same year. She then went to the Rank Charm School and took small roles in films such as What the Butler Saw and King of the Underworld between 1950 and 1952. However, Valery's career in acting was not established and focused her attention to presenting on television, working for the ITV company Associated-Rediffusion and on afternoon programmes for the BBC. She later worked as an assistant to the editor of The Observer's home page and as a mechanic/deckand on a charter boat operating in the Mediterranean. By the late 1960s, Valery operated a second- hand shop that sold clothes and bric-a-brac in West London's Portobello Road. Her partner Robin Jacques (the brother of the actress Hattie Jacques) encouraged her to write two volumes of autobiography: Baron Von Kodak, Shirley Temple and Me (1976) and The Edge of Smile (1977). Valery became settled as a full-time writer in the mid 1970s by not only writing her autobiography volumes but wrote scripts for the television soaps Crossroads and Emmerdale as well as The Passing Out Parade and Nanny Knows Best. She contributed to the biography of her friend Quentin Crisp, The Stately Homo. Valery's script for The Passing Out Parade created issues for the six male directors who told her that women did not speak in that manner and that the drama was considered \\"too difficult\\" for early 1970s television. Her career progressed when the BBC asked her to write for the drama show about student nurses Angels. It was during the production of the show that Valery began a friendship with fellow writer Jill Hyem. Valery and Hyem were commissioned by the BBC to write episodes for the BAFTA-nominated drama Tenko (1981‚Äì1985) after the first two episodes had been written by a male. During the writing of Tenko, Valery and Hyem faced opposition for their female points of view from men, including the producer Ken Riddington. Riddington, \\"a wonderful man\\" according to Valery, had expected the story lines would receive a more \\"romantic treatment\\". The year after the final episode of Tenko was broadcast, she assisted Hyem in writing a feature-length episode, Tenko Reunion, for which Valery wrote the accompanying novel. Valery later wrote the 1986 drama series Ladies in Charge which was about an employment agency established after World War I to aid women leaving the front lines with their independence. =Other activities and death= Valery was an ardent feminist; she was firm in her political beliefs and was involved in opposition to Greece's military junta. She was vehemently opposed to capital punishment which prompted her to once refuse to disembark from a cruise ship in Los Angeles to protest the local Californian laws. Valery had involvement with the Writers' Guild of Great Britain and served on its council, becoming one of its outspoken members over its traditional views and censorship. She died in London on 29 April 2013. The London School of Economics holds a collection relating to Valery in the library's catalogue. They include her personal papers and photographs relating to her career.

In 1797 her captain was commodore of a small group of East Indiamen that managed to bluff a French squadron of warships into sailing away to avoid an engagement. In 1812 Woodford was sold for breaking up. Career =EIC voyage #1 (1791‚Äì1792)= Captain Charles Lennox sailed from the Downs on 27 March 1791, bound for Bencoolen and China. Woodford reached Bencoolen on 25 July and arrived at Whampoa Anchorage on 6 October. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 13 January 1792, reached St Helena on 3 April, and arrived at the Downs on 17 May. =EIC voyage #2 (1794‚Äì1795)= Captain Charles Lennox received a letter of marque on 20 February 1794.Letter of Marque, p.93 ‚Äì accessed 25 July 2017. The British government held Woodford at Portsmouth, together with a number of other Indiamen in anticipation of using them as transports for an attack on √éle de France (Mauritius). It gave up the plan and released the vessels in May 1794. It paid ¬£1666 5s for having delayed her departure by 62 days. Captain Lennox sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May, bound for Bombay and China. Woodford reached Bombay on 4 September and arrived at Whampoa on 26 February 1795. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 19 May and reached Batavia on 5 August. She reached St Helena on 16 October, and arrived at the Downs on 21 December. =EIC voyage #3 (1796‚Äì1798)= Captain Lennox sailed from Portsmouth on 17 May 1796 bound for Bombay and China. Woodford reached Bombay on 5 September and Colombo on 9 December. At Colombo Woodford met up with five other East Indiamen,: , , , Canton, and . The fleet sailed towards China under the overall command of Captain James Farquahrson in Alfred, who was the senior captain and so commodore of the fleet. On 28 January 1797 the Indiamen were off Java when they encountered six French frigates. Farquharson proceeded to organize a bluff. To give the impression that the convoy consisted of the powerful ships of the line that the Indiamen resembled, Farquharson ordered his ships to advance in line of battle, and the French retreated, convinced they were facing a superior force. The Indiamen sailed east and then up towards China. Ocean wrecked in a storm the next day, but Woodford and the other four Indiamen arrived at Whampoa on 8 or 9 April. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 9 June, reached the Cape of Good Hope on 3 December and St Helena on 3 January 1798, and arrived at the Downs on 17 March. =EIC voyage #4 (1799‚Äì1800)= Captain James Martin received a letter of marque on 20 March 1799.

She sailed form Bombay on 23 January 1800 in company with to gather pepper on the Malabar Coast prior to returning to England.Naval Chronicle Vol.3, p. 418. On 1 February 1800 she was at Anjengo. From there she sailed to Quilon, which she reached 4 four days later. Woodford and Albion were at Anjengo again on 15 February, and then homeward bound, they reached St Helena on 15 May. Woodford and Albion arrived at the Downs on 3 August. =EIC voyage #5 (1801‚Äì1802)= Captain James Martin sailed from Portsmouth on 19 May 1801 bound for China. Woodford reached Rio de Janeiro on 31 July and Penang on 31 October, and arrived at Whampoa on 1 February 1802. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 30 March, reached St Helena on 10 July, and arrived at the Downs on 11 September. =EIC voyage #6 (1803‚Äì1805)= In the months before the resumption of war with France, the Navy started preparations that included impressing seamen. The crews of outbound Indiamen were an attractive target. Woodford and were sitting in the Thames in March 1803, taking their crews on board just prior to sailing. At sunset, a press gang from HMS Immortalite rowed up to Woodford, while boats from and approached Ganges. As the press gangs approached they were noticed, and the crews of both Indiamen were piped to quarters. That is, they assembled on the decks armed with pikes and cutlasses, and anything they could throw. The officers in charge of the press gangs thought this mere bravado and pulled alongside the Indiamen, only to meet a severe resistance from the crewmen, who had absolutely no desire to serve in the Royal Navy. The men from Immortalite suffered several injuries from shot and pike that were thrown at them, and eventually the marines opened fire with muskets, killing two sailors on Woodford. Even so, the press gangs were not able to get on board either Indiaman, and eventually withdrew some distance. When Woodfords officers finally permitted the press gang from Immortalite to board, all they found on board were a few sickly sailors. Because war with France had resumed, James Martin required a new letter of marque, which he received on 20 June. The letter gives an anomalously low number for the size of Woodfords crew. (Gangess letter of marque had been issued in February, i.e., before the incident, and reports a crew size of 135 men.) Captain Martin sailed from Portsmouth on 21 May 1803, bound for China. Woodford arrived at Whampoa on 24 January 1804. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 9 March and reached Penang on 21 April.

Named the \\"first modern mayor of Belgrade\\", he is today probably best remembered as the founder of the Belgrade Zoo.  Early life  Iliƒá was born on in Vlasotince, south Serbia, as the youngest of six sons of Kostadina (n√©e Stojilkoviƒá) and Kosta Iliƒá, a mumd≈æija, or the soap-maker. His father was among the first generation of merchants which developed in Vlasotince in the 1860s and 1870s, while the area was still occupied by the Ottoman Empire. He originally produced soaps and candles and his occupation name became his nickname, Kosta Mumd≈æija. After Turks withdrew in 1878, Kosta bought the land from them, becoming a landowner. He later developed the family business into the large company, which included the textile production. He had five brothers (Sotir, Mihajlo, Milan, Petar and Blagoje) and a sister Jevrosima, nicknamed Roska. She was married to Mika Jankoviƒá, from Leskovac, but they later moved to Belgrade. Blagoje was murdered by the Bulgarian occupation forces during the World War I, Milan and Petar had no children, so only Mihajlo and Jevrosima have living descendants today. They live in Belgrade, some are in Croatia, and one branch is in Leskovac.Saga o Vladi Iliƒáu, 7 godina istra≈æivanja Sa≈°e Stankoviƒáa Other brothers were mostly oriented to the business family owned in Leskovac. During Interbellum, Leskovac had 5,000 workers out of which 1,500 were employed by the Iliƒá family. They were the major benefactors in Leskovac prior to World War II (palaces, churches, newspapers, etc.) As only Vlada and Sotir showed an interest into studying, their father sent them abroad. Vlada finished the Trading Academy in Vienna, Austria and then studied the industrial cloth production at the Textile Faculty in Aachen, Germany. He graduated and returned to Serbia in 1904.  Business career  His father Kosta, who also ventured into trade and shark loaning, bought the cable company near Leskovac in 1896. To expand the business, he, in partnership with his sons, bought a cloth factory from German entrepreneur Eugen Michael in 1906, which was located in Belgrade's neighborhood of Karaburma. One of the shareholders in the factory, originally established in 1897, was another German industrialist, Carl Wolf, who also owned a hemp fiber factory in Vranje. Connected by business, the Iliƒá family soon owned both factories which was core of the future business empire. In 1910 the company was transformed into the joint- stock company with the capital of 3,000,000 dinars in gold. Prior to the World War I, the brothers acquired the latest English technology for the cloth production as they bought the \\"Crompton Ltd\\", a Belgrade branch of the \\"Ungarische Tehtilindustrie\\". \\"Crompton Ltd\\", a successor of \\"Hattersley & Crompton\\", had looms made by the latest Hattersley technology, which boosted the production. During the World War I, he was one of the participants in the \\"Opanak affair\\", when footwear for the Serbian army produced by his company turned out to be unusable due to the extremely low quality. Vlada Iliƒá also applied the principles he learned in Austria and Germany to the production in his concern. The conglomerate included 17 companies, including: cable factory (in the village of Kozare, near Leskovac), First Leskovac cloth factory and hemp fiber factory, wool fibre factory, linen factory (all in Leskovac), Hemicos factory and another linen factory (in Belgrade), Serbia Steam mill (Skopje), Serbian carpet factory \\"Lazar Dunƒëerski\\" and First Serbian net factory (in Beƒçkerek), wool linen factory (in Karlovac), hydro-electrical power plant (in Vlasotince), etc. Effect on the town of Leskovac was such, that until the 1990s, when Serbian economy collapsed, due to the developed texitile industry, Leskovac was nicknamed the \\"Serbian Manchester\\". The business survived through the economy crisis from 1931 to 1933, thanks to the loans from the National Bank. After his brother Sotir died in 1935, Vlada took over as a sole head of the conglomerate. Company was boosted when the new contract was signed with the Yugoslav Army in 1939. Iliƒá enjoyed the major support of Milan Stojadinoviƒá, an economist and a politician, finance minister (1922‚Äì24, 1924‚Äì26, 1934‚Äì35) and prime minister of Yugoslavia (1935‚Äì39). He was member of Stojadinoviƒá's party Yugoslav Radical Union (JRZ or Jereza) and of Jugoras, state sponsored Yugoslav Workers Trade Union. As the competent entrepreneur, he was a longtime president of the City of Belgrade's Industrial Chamber and of the Central Industrial Corporation of Yugoslavia. Apart from factories, it is known that he owned shares in the foreign banks, in Istanbul and Alexandria, but there were also stories about secret accounts in Swiss banks. Before the World War II broke out, Iliƒá was in negotiations with the Ford Motor Company for obtaining the license to assemble the cars in Yugoslavia.  Mayor of Belgrade  Monument to Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, dedicated in 1935 Staro Sajmi≈°te by night, finished in 1938 Iliƒá took over as the mayor on 10 January 1935, stayed in office until 13 September 1939, and conducted a considerable modernization of the city. He worked on fixing the social problems in the city and extensively built social housings, medical institutes, schools and children shelters, but also on draining the bogs and marshes, building parks, roads and squares. = Transportation = The first tram line which connected Belgrade to Zemun, across the Sava river was established over the new King Alexander Bridge, which was opened just few weeks before Iliƒá's tenure began. The first bridge in Belgrade over the Danube, the King Peter II Bridge (today the Panƒçevo Bridge) was opened on 27 October 1935. A railway from the Belgrade Main railway station, which encircled the central ridge of the city along the rivers, and then continuing over the King Peter II Bridge was also constructed. = Buildings = The foundations of the Saint Sava Church were laid on 10 May 1935. On 7 November 1935 the Monument to Vuk Karad≈æiƒá was dedicated. In 1937, the last slum in downtown Belgrade, on Terazije, was demolished. In 1938 the construction of Palace Albania, at the time the tallest building in the Balkans began (finished in 1940). The first planned expansion of Belgrade over the Sava began on 6 June 1937 with the construction of the Staro Sajmi≈°te complex for the Belgrade Fair and in 1938 the drying and filling of the surrounding marshes began, with an envisioned new city for 500,000 inhabitants. The new Communist authorities continued with the works after 1948 which resulted in the construction of New Belgrade. It hosted international fairs, with task of promoting the economy of Yugoslavia as well. On 10 September 1938 one of the exhibitions on the fair was the first presentation of television in this part of Europe by Philips, and the air shows and the first car show in Belgrade were held there. He personally donated funds for the construction of Military Medical Academy. Numerous institutions were also opened: City Polyclinic (1935), Institute for Disinfection, City Hospital (1935), Polyclinic for the skin and venereal diseases (1938), orphanage in Zveƒçanska street (1935‚Äì38), University Children's Clinic in Tir≈°ova (1936‚Äì40), etc. A dozen of new schools were built in this period. After acquiring the Michael's factory in 1906 in Karaburma, Iliƒá sequestered a room and adapted it into the school for the children of his workers. He personally paid the teacher's wages. As the factory complex expanded and number of workers grew, the provisional school became too small, so Iliƒá rented the upper floor of the nearby Lavadinoviƒá kafana, still fully financed by him. The local population objected that a school and kafana share a building. Iliƒá then purchased a lot, some away and built a proper school while the old one remained in use until 1933. Named elementary school \\"Cloth Factory Iliƒá\\", it was built from his donations in 1923. It has been renamed \\"Jovan Cvijiƒá\\" in 1931, a name it still bears today. = Zoo = As a mayor, Iliƒá personally donated the land and the fundings for the Belgrade Zoo. When opened on 12 July 1936 in the Kalemegdan Park in Belgrade Fortress, it covered an area twice larger than it occupies today. It stretched into the parts of the \\"Lower Town\\" section of the fortress, up to the Neboj≈°a Tower. On 12 July 2009 a bust dedicated to him was erected in the zoo with the inscription: \\"And after many decades, (still) thankful Belgraders\\". Also, one of the paths inside the zoo was named after him. The zoo is today owned and operated by the city and is officially classified as the \\"bequest of Vlada Iliƒá\\". = Economy = He conducted the tax reform, concerning the sales taxes and reduced the cost of electricity (he was a main shareholder in Electrical Serbian Company), which boosted the development of craft shops. He also leveled the city budget and brought city finances in order. His tenure of almost 5 years in office was a rarity in Belgrade, as in the previous decades city saw a large number of mayors which would stay for short terms. City finances were in huge debt and city administration was characterized by the major corruption and negligence. He introduced structural reforms, austerity measures concerning the expenditures of the administration and hired new, young people.  Personal life  Iliƒá married Olga Jovanoviƒá (1898‚Äì1959), from Kikinda. Olga, nicknamed Cica, through her mother Olga Dunƒëerski was a member of another famous and wealthy family, the , Her grandfather, (1833‚Äì1917), was a major industrialist and landowner in Vojvodina and one of the reachest people in the region. Dunƒëerski was one of the shareholders in the Iliƒá brothers' conglomerate. Result of the merger of two wealthy families, both personal and business, was that Vlada Iliƒá was one of the richest persons in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, prior to the World War II. The best man at his wedding was King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, and he was a close friend to the regent, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. The couple had no children. Iliƒá once said that he would give all of his wealth for just one child. He owned a villa built in 1935, which was designed by Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá, in the Academism manner. The ornaments and the sculptural sets are works of ≈Ωivojin Lukiƒá. The edifice has a ceremonial entry porch, Ionian columns, ornamental windows and is considered one of the most distinguished houses in Belgrade's Interbellum architecture. After 1947 confiscation, the mansion was handed over to the \\"Generalexport\\" company, which later developed into the internationally successful \\"Genex\\". After almost 50 years, the \\"Genex\\" sold villa, through an ad, to Nemanja ƒêorƒëeviƒá, then a senior member of JUL, or Yugoslav Left, political party founded by Mirjana Markoviƒá, first lady of Serbia as a wife of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. ƒêorƒëeviƒá then bestowed it to his party. so it became the seat of JUL. ƒêorƒëeviƒá then sued the party wanting the house back and the successors of Vlada Iliƒá also entered the process of restitution, asking for villa to be returned to them. The court ultimately decided in ƒêorƒëeviƒá's favor. The mansion is located in the neighborhood of Stari Grad, in modern Venizelosova street and today is adapted into the club and hotel Admiral, with 4 stars and 17 rooms and apartments. There are three special rooms with different interiors: French room, in the French Empire style, Italian room, in the Italian baroque style while the room used by Markoviƒá, and nicknamed \\"Mira's room\\" after her, was adapted into the Russian room, in the Russian Empire style. He built apartments in Karaburma for his employees, and even his villa was built on a location close to his factories. Every year, on Lazarus Saturday, which is in Serbia observed as the children's holiday of Vrbica, he would donate the complete wardrobe to the children of his workers. He was known for visiting the homes of his employees and giving present to their children and due to his humane attitude towards his workers, he was nicknamed \\"workers' mother\\". Every girl working in his factories which was to be married, was granted a type of dowry-like financial gift. He helped financially the poorest workers organizing \\"winter help\\" and was the first Serbian industrialist who introduced the eight-hour working day. Iliƒá was fluent in German, French and English. He was a recipient of the Order of St. Sava and of Order of Karaƒëorƒëe's Star with swords. Also, he was a member of the Rotary Club Belgrade.Rotari Klub Beograd Though he left his birthplace as a minor, Iliƒá often helped Vlasotince. He was very fond of Petar Spiriƒá, his elementary school teacher, so as an act of gratitude he donated money, in his teacher's name, for the construction of Cultural Center in Vlasotince in 1930, so Spiriƒá is named as one of the contributors on the memorial plaque. Every Easter, Iliƒá sent 45 suits for the underprivileged pupils and his mother-in- law dispatched a railroad car of wheat to the Vlasotince Red Cross in 1929, which was distributed to 320 poorest families. Many workers in his factories originated from the region, so an \\"Association of Vlasotince\\" was founded in Belgrade in 1928, which today bears his name. = Equestrianism = Iliƒá was very much into horses. In the village of Hajduƒçica, near Plandi≈°te, he owned a \\"Vlasina\\" stable, well known in Europe. He was a member of the \\"Danube circle of the equestrians \\"Knez Mihailo\\", which operated the Belgrade Hippodrome in the neighbourhood of Careva ƒÜuprija. He greatly influenced the development of horse racing in Serbia. Officially, the race track was open on 28 June 1914 and, because of the situation after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria which happened on that day, the hippodrome worked only for one day as a month later the World War I began. By the ukaz issued by king Alexander I of Yugoslavia in 1920, he ceded the hippodrome's land to the Danube circle for the next 75 years, free of lease. In 1921 first gallop derby and Belgrade City Race were held. Trotting races were organized since 1930. After World War II, new Communist government nationalized the track in 1949 and named it \\"Belgrade Hippodrome\\". Iliƒá's stallion Vesnik (\\"Messenger\\") set records during the Interbellum, while his filly Laguna won the triple crown in 1941. Though new authorities took the stable from him, they kept his horses, and his stallion Jadran II (\\"Adriatic\\"), won a triple crown in 1948. His name was largely left out in the history of Serbian horse racing until the late 20th century. Today, a race is named in his honour.  World War II  During the political turmoil prior to the World War II, German ambassador to Belgrade, Viktor von Heeren, suggested to the regent, Prince Paul, to appoint Iliƒá as the new prime minister of Yugoslavia. Historians believe that Iliƒá wasn't interested, as everything pointed out that he could easily become a head of the government: Germans supported him, he was a personal friend to the prince regent and was one of the most distinguished persons in the state. Instead, Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá became new prime minister in 1939. When Axis powers attacked Yugoslavia, king Peter II of Yugoslavia and the government fled the country by plane. One seat was reserved for Iliƒá but he refused, though his wife urged him to leave, and spent the entire occupation in Belgrade. He signed the \\"Appeal to the Serbian people\\" from 13 August 1941. Over 400 public figures signed the document which asked for the allegiance to the system of occupation and the German new order in Serbia. Still, many refused to sign it, including Ivo Andriƒá, Isidora Sekuliƒá, Milutin Milankoviƒá, etc. He, and Aleksandar Beliƒá, president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, pleaded to general Milan Nediƒá to accept the position as the head of the collaborationist regime in 1941. His factories continued to work, having contracts with the Nediƒá's quasi-army. However, he didn't work with the Chetniks, major opponents of the, later victorious, Communist Partisan rebels.  Imprisonment  New Communist authorities arrested Iliƒá in late 1944 and he was imprisoned together with the greatest Serbian actress ≈Ωanka Stokiƒá. They tried him even before the war ended. He was tried for collaboration with the occupying forces at the Military Court of the Belgrade City Command (rulling 333/44 from 26 March 1945) and then at the Higher Military Court (rulling 237/45 from 5 April 1945). By both rulings, he was found guilty for \\"strengthening the potential of the occupational forces by allowing his factories to work\\". Just as with all the other industrialists, this was used as the legal pretext for the confiscation of his entire assets and properties, which was conducted by the decision No. 153/42-02 of the Srez Court for the Belgrade Raion from 17 January 1947. Well known after-war state owned textile companies, like Beteks, Beko and Vunarski kombinat, developed from Iliƒá's factories. Prior to sentencing, he was ordered to sweep streets of Belgrade as a punishment. He was sentenced to death, but Winston Churchill personally intervened with Josip Broz Tito, so the sentence was changed to 10 years. He spent almost 6 years in the Sremska Mitrovica Prison. His former employees would pay him visits and bring packages. He was released in late 1951.  Death  Once one of the richest persons in the state, Iliƒá was left with absolutely nothing. His wife Olga pawned her jewelry, including the wedding ring, and they would receive groceries from the people who would recognize her on the market and give her food for free. She earned money as a seamstress and giving lessons in English, French and German. When he left the prison, they moved into the room in the attic of his distant relatives. By that time, all of his five brothers died with only one, and his sister, having grandchildren. He died on 3 July 1952, after suffering a stroke. Since he died in utter poverty, his former employees paid for his funeral. Olga died in 1959.  Rehabilitation  District Court of Belgrade, after adopting the motion for the rehabilitation of Vlada Iliƒá, in February 2009 annulled the judgment of the Military Court, thus formally rehabilitating Iliƒá. The court especially stated that the \\"main intention\\" of the 1945 process was for the government to take all of his assets and properties: \\"He had to be declared an enemy of the people so that such conviction would be a basis and an excuse for the state to take his wealth\\". Even before the formal rehabilitation, the descendants of the Iliƒá family started the process of restitution. Jovanka Laliƒá, granddaughter of Vlada's sister Jevrosima, and six other relatives, began the process in 2003. By 2009 the courts denied them to regain the ownership over the companies of David Pajiƒá Daka and Vunarskog kombinata, allowing for companies to be privatized, despite the restitution process. Additionally, the court also refused to return the villa and the only object that court did award to the descendants is Iliƒá's tomb at the Belgrade New Cemetery. In 2004, one street in the neighborhood of Karaburma was named after him.Belgrade streets name change in 2004PlanPlus ‚Äì Ulica Vlade Iliƒáa A monograph on his life, Prvi moderni gradonaƒçelnik Beograda (\\"The first modern mayor of Belgrade\\"), was authored by Sa≈°a Z.

The axial sculpture consists of (on the body whorl 10) low rounded ribs with wider interspaces, obsolete on the base and the incremental sculpture indicated by the rather distant sharp striae. The spiral sculpture consists of (on the spire two, on the body whorl three) rather prominent nodules on the ribs with no conspicuous cord in the corresponding part of the interspaces; otherwise the spiral sculpture, especially on the latter whorls, comprises sharp narrow grooves with wider flattened interspaces which become more cordlike on the earlier whorls and the base. The whorls are moderately rounded with no indication of an anal fasciole. The suture is distinct but not appressed. The aperture in the type specimen is elongate ovate with a simple columella and a thin sharp outer lip. The siphonal canal is short, deep, forming a distinct but small siphonal fasciole and is slightly recurved.

FER plays a significant part in the plant immune system as a receptor kinase which assists in immune signaling within plants, plant growth, and plant reproduction. FER is regulated by the Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF). FER regulates growth in normal environments but it is most beneficial in stressful environments as it helps to initiate immune signaling. FER can also play a role in reproduction in plants by participating in the communication between the female and male cells. FER is found in and can be studied in the organism Arabidopsis thaliana. __TOC__  Taxonomic lineage  Feronia (FER) has a taxonomic lineage as follows: Eukaryota > Viridiplantae > Streptophyta > Embryophyta > Tracheophyta > Spermatophyta > Magnoliophyta > Eudicotyledons > Gunneridae > Pentapetalae > Rosids > Malvids > Brassicales > Brassicaceae > Camelineae > Arabidopsis.  Background  Arabidopsis thaliana is a weed commonly found alongside roads and is frequently used in experiments which examine plant genetics or biology. It can be studied due to its small number of megabase pairs (Mbp) which makes it easily synthesized. It is used often to observe and understand plant immunity and it can be used to observe the functions of pattern recognition receptors (PRR). The Site-1 Protease (S1P) found in Arabidopsis plays a role in inhibiting plant immunity when it cleaves the Rapid alkalization factor (RALF). RALF can be subject to malfunction or failure due to S1P which then causes a decrease in root growth for the plant. RALF proteins are found in plants and could be the proteins which make up the signaling portions found within the immune system of plants. Feronia (FER)' mediates the inhibition caused by the S1P in Arabidopsis. FER is one of the known 17 proteins which play a part in Arabidopsis Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls).  Discovery  Initially being discovered from a pollen tube reception mutant, feronia (FER) was found to be necessary in cell growth and hormone response. During a study of the reproduction of angiosperms, there were continued failures in the interaction of the synergid and the pollen tubes that caused infertility. The feronia (FER) mutant female gametophyte was tested in this process and found that it inhibited the rupture of the sperm cells and invaded the embryo sac. This furthered expression of synergid- specific genes and helped with extension of the pollen tubes. Feronia(FER) was named after the Etruscan fertility goddess as it increases growth. RALF was isolated as a small peptide when it alkalized cell wall growth rapidly and inhibited cell growth in tobacco leaves. In Arabidopsis roots, the RALF- FER signal transduction pathways continues to control and moderate cell growth and hormone responses in the plasma membrane and root cell growth. Feronia is the receptor to RALF and was found to regulate the effect of RALF in the cell elongation in the Arabidopsis roots. Biological function Often, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) found in the plant immune system are receptor kinases, i.e. Arabidopsis thaliana. Feronia (FER) is a Arabidopsis malectin-like receptor kinase for binding to the Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) which has been discovered to be linked to the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. FER contributes to the positive regulation of immunity by acting as a scaffold. FER could occupy parts of the microdomains found in the plasma membrane and perform with both the receptors and coreceptors to create signaling platforms. In this way, FER can inhibit cell elongation and growth as well as regulate fertilization. FER also plays a role in regulating the elongation length of plant roots in Arabidopsis as well as regulating pathways involved with hormone responses such as auxin-promoted root hair growth. FER could also be connected to the regulatory pathway associated with ABA-mediated abiotic stress responses because it can activate a negative regulator of ABA signaling known as the ABI2. The FER kinase can activate the GTPase ROP11/ARAC10 in plants through communication and interaction with the guanine exchange factors GEF1, GEF4, and GEF10.

He is one of the prominent poets to be associated with the Participation literary movement (also known as the Resistance movement) of the 1970s and 1980s in South Korea.  Life  Jung Hee Sung was born in the city of Changwon in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. He attended Yongsan High School and studied Korean language and literature at Seoul National University. Following his graduation in 1968, he was drafted into the South Korean army. While he was serving in the army, his poem \\"Byeonsin\\" (Î≥ÄÏã† Transformation) won the Dong-a Ilbo New Writer's Contest in 1970, launching his literary career. When he completed his service that same year, he began working as a high school Korean Literature teacher while completing a master's program at Seoul National University. He belonged to a coterie of South Korean poets including Lee Kyu-ho and Kang Unkyo who collaborated in self-publishing a literary magazine called The Seventies. His early poems mainly drew inspiration from classical Korean texts, yet put a fresh spin on the mythical worlds they depicted. From the mid-1970s, he began to write works that condemned social problems, and today he is seen as one of South Korea's leading Resistance poets. He is not considered a prolific poet, with only six poetry collections spanning his five-decade career. In 2006, he was elected the 16th Chairman of the Writers Association of Korea.  Writing  Many of Jung's early works play with the myths, legends, and hyangga poetry included in Samguk Yusa, or Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms. His first poetry collection Dapcheong (ÎãµÏ≤≠ Treading on Grass in Spring) also uses similar motifs. Published in 1974, the collection provides new interpretations of old mythical worlds in careful and controlled verse. From the mid-1970s, he wrote a series of socially conscious poems to take a stand against the realities of the oppressive society and show his support for underprivileged groups and minorities. In particular, his 1978 collection Jeomun gange sabeul sitgo (Ï†ÄÎ¨∏ Í∞ïÏóê ÏÇΩÏùÑ ÏîªÍ≥† Rinsing the Shovel in the Twilight River) consists of works that portray everyday scenes in great detail. These poems overcome the limits of Participation poetry, break free of fixed verse forms, and convey powerful emotions. Jeomun established Jung's reputation as a leading Participation (or Resistance) poet of the 1970s who carried on the legacy of Kim Soo-young and Sin Dong-yup (pioneers of Participation poetry in the 1960s), and who captured in his poems the energy and wholesomeness inherent in the everyday lives of ordinary people. In 1991, 13 years after the publication of Jeomun, Jung's third collection was published, entitled Han geuriumi dareun geuriumege (Ìïú Í∑∏Î¶¨ÏõÄÏù¥ Îã§Î•∏ Í∑∏Î¶¨ÏõÄÏóêÍ≤å One Longing to Another).

It claims compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment. This matter had been addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association (2005).  Latest developments and next steps  In June 2017, the court issued a preliminary injunction that stopped the Montana Beef Board from using beef producers' checkoff contributions for advertising, unless the producers approve in advance. The decision hung on the distinction between commercial speech and government speech. Compelled commercial speech is a First Amendment violation. This is in contraposition to Johanns v.

He makes his decision dependent on the counting of his uniform buttons: \\"Should I?, Should I not?, Should I?, Kn√∂ppe, you want! No not yet!\\" The question of an Imperial Sovereign or emperor was a central issue in Germany's attempts at unification from 1848 to 1850. Both the draft constitutional act with its provision for centralised power as well as the constitutional plans at that time, laid down how a German head of state would be selected for office and what rights they were to have. In the Frankfurt Constitution of 28 March 1849, it was envisaged that an emperor would be the 'imperial sovereign'. Although the National Assembly voted for the first incumbent of this office, thereafter it was assumed that the office would be hereditary. The emperor was to be inviolable as a constitutional monarch, but would appoint responsible ministers. Frederick William IV, King of Prussia, rejected the imperial dignity which had been proposed to him. Instead, he tried unsuccessfully to unite Germany in his own authority. Under the terms of the Erfurt Union, which he proposed, the Imperial Sovereign was first and foremost the Reichsvorstand (Imperial Executive), and then the Unionvorstand (Union Executive). The Unionvorstand had to share certain rights with other princes, above all, the veto of proposed laws.  Background and terminology  Barbarossa, coloured copper engraving from 1847 The title of Emperor originally came from the ancient Roman Empire and was familiar, not least because of its use in the medieval Holy Roman Empire. It had become natural that the German king also had the title of Holy Roman Emperor. For centuries, this had been the head of the Austrian House of Habsburg until, in 1806, the Empire was dissolved under pressure from Napoleon. The renunciation of imperial Holy Roman crown was made easier for Austria, because it was allowed by Napoleon to elevate itself to become the empire of Austria. In the German Confederation from 1815, there was no emperor. The supreme body was a Federal Assembly (often called the Bundestag) with the presidency held by Austria. The romanticism of the time, however, meant there was a romantic idealisation of the medieval empire combined with the notion of a mighty emperor. One of the focal points of such fantasies was the 12th-century emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, who, according to the Kyffh√§user legend, slept in the mountains there, but would return one day to unite Germany. As early as 1814-15, when the establishment of the German Confederation was still being discussed, Baron vom Stein had demanded a German emperor as head of the federation. Up to 34 smaller and medium-sized states followed suit. But the disunity between Prussia and Austria, as well as that between the other larger states, meant that this was not realised, either in the form of an emperor or of a directorate (Direktorium) or committee (Deutscher Ausschuss) made up of the five largest states. As Stein explained to the Russian Tsar in a memorandum on 17 February 1815, Austria was to appoint the German Emperor in order to bind it firmly to Germany. In the years 1848 to 1850, further terms were proposed, which either avoided or concealed the monarchical character of a German head of state: Reichsoberhaupt (\\"imperial head of state\\"), Reichsvorstand (\\"imperial executive\\") or Reichsverweser (\\"imperial administrator\\"). These terms could be interpreted variously to mean either an elected president or a prince as primus inter pares. When the terms \\"imperial authority\\" (Reichsgewalt) or \\"central authority\\" (Zentralgewalt) were used, they meant the \\"state\\" in the sense of the highest level of federal government, equivalent to the federal level in Germany today. Thus a distinction was made between the authority of the central power and that of the individual states within the Empire. The question then remained of who should exercise this central authority. In most cases, they envisaged a monarch whose power was limited by: a constitution, a body representing the people and by ministerial answerability. The terms \\"government\\" (Regierung) or \\"imperial government\\" (Reichsregierung) could mean the monarch and his ministers or just the ministers themselves (as the electable part of the government).  Revolution and attempted Imperial Reform, March‚ÄìMay 1848  After the violent events on 18 March in Berlin, King Frederick William IV promised that he would put himself forward as the head of the national unity movement. Joseph von Radowitz wrote a memorandum in 1847 On behalf of the Prussian King, which on 15 March resulted in an Austrian-Prussian conference plan. The memorandum alluded to a central authority, but remained silent about a possible German head of state. In his proposal of 12 February, Bassmann, a representative from Baden, mentioned chambers at the Bundestag and uniform national institutions, but no head of state. On the other hand, Heinrich von Gagern explicitly mentioned in his motion of 28 February an interim head of Germany, who was to appoint a responsible cabinet. In March 1848, disturbances arose across German states similar to those seen in the French Revolution of 1848. The frightened German monarchs installed liberal governments, and delegated liberal envoys to the Bundestag. The conventional wisdom among the people was that the time had come for a unified Germany and to provide it with a modern constitution. The Bundestag elected a national assembly, which would draft a constitution and unite governments. Even before the election, the Bundestag set up a committee which made a constitutional proposal for a national federal state, the was issued on 26 April 1848. In the preface, the draft emphasized the importance of establishing a strong imperial sovereign in order to guarantee and achieve German unity. The Imperial Sovereign, known as Kaiser, had to be inviolable with ministers accountable to him. As far as law-making, he was to have a coequal responsibility to that of the Reichstag, the partially elected parliament. This draft was the first one put forth during the March Revolutions which provided for a hereditary emperor, according to . Although the draft had no formal status, it was nevertheless an influential model for the later imperial constitution of 28 March 1849. A further development took place in the Bundestag itself. There was a plan to set up a federal executive committee to finally give the federal government an executive. The three members had to be representatives form Austria and Prussia. For the third, Bavaria had to make a proposal list and the other individual states of the Council of Engers (of the Bundestag) would choose the third. However, because the national assembly would soon meet on 18 May, the Bundestag did not set up this body.  National Assembly  Caricature of the (supposed) enthusiasm of German princes, to be the crowned head of Germany. Frederick William IV rises on the shoulder of the Deutscher Michel. The National Assembly immediately wanted to establish a provisional constitution order with a provisional central executive. According to Ernst Rudolf Huber, \\"the absence of a central power [...] was the core element of the old Federal Constitution\\". There were now seven different solutions to the debate, which continued until March 1849. # A Democratic-Republican leader (President) who served for a fixed term of four, five or seven years. He would be chosen by the people or the people's representative. This was supported by the Democrats and partly by the left- wing centre of the National Assembly. # A dynastic Republican sovereign. Only a member of a governing princely house could be elected. He could be elected by the people or the people's representatives. # A democratic directorate, with three, five or seven members. Any citizen could be chosen. For this solution, the federalist thinkers were among the Democrats. # A democratic directorate, the governing princes would have been elective or permanently appointed princes of certain states. An example was the proposed \\"Prince Electoral Council of the Three Uncles\\", Archduke John (Uncle to Austrian Emperor Ferdinand), Prince Wilhelm the Elder (Uncle to the Prussian King, Frederick William IV) and Prince Karl Theodor (Uncle to the Bavarian King, Maximilian II). # An electoral empire, with an emperor elected by the people or parliament for life. A member of a dynasty or only a ruling prince could be elected. This solution was favoured mainly by the left-centre. # Alternating sovereigns, with the Austrian F√ºrst for the first six years, and then the Prussian one for the next six. # Hereditary emperorship, The very first official was to be elected. Only a dynastic member or a F√ºrst was eligible. Afterward, the crown would be inherited. In the Emperorship, occupied by a ruling prince, a permanent personal union of Imperial Head of State and Territorial Prince would have arisen. The Austrian Emperor and the King of Prussia were the only ones considered. For the hereditary emperor as a solution came those who desired a single and effective empire against the individual states. = Provisional Constitution = On 3 June 1848, the National Assembly adopted a committee of 15 members, who proposed a three- member board with a majority of eleven to four votes. Governments had to propose this and agree to the National Assembly. The Board set up a ministry (a government) which would be responsible for the National Assembly. Archduke John of Austria, Reichsverweser of the German Empire from 29 June 1848 to 20 December 1849. The Democratic minority of the Fifteen-Committee, on the other hand, thought of an executive committee. The chairman would be elected by the National Assembly and then the other members of the committee. The majority of the National Assembly could at any time dismiss the executive committee. The moderate democrat Robert Blum imagined that the executive committee would essentially send the resolutions of the National Assembly to the Governments for execution. The decisive democrats, on the other hand, demanded that the provisional Imperial Government immediately take over the actual executive power of all of Germany. The majority did not want to leave the familiar ground of the former constitutional right. Although the Imperial Government was responsible parliamentary, yet they turned against a pure parliamentary rule, following the example of the Convention in the French Revolution. The left-centre also did not want the National Assembly to recall the president as the head of the executive. On 24 June, Heinrich von Gagern, the liberal president of the National Assembly, brought an end to the various proposals and thus the debate from 19 to 25 June. He called on the National Assembly to use a provisional central authority on its own (in a \\"bold grip\\"). On 28 June, a majority of the National Assembly voted in favour of the Central Power Act and the following day for the election of Archduke John to Reichsverweser. A Reichsverweser was traditionally the official who governed until the establishment of the final monarch. John of Austria was popular among the people and was thus most likely to be acceptable to the left, on the other hand, he was a high-ranking noble of the Right. Reichsverweser John then set up the first Reichsministerium, the real government of the emerging German Empire, in July and August. = Debates about the Imperial Constitution = In January 1849, a campaign for a referendum erupted in the National Assembly, which highlighted the many differing opinions there. On 19 January 1849, the majority, with 339 votes to 122, rejected the request of the moderate left and the more pronounced \\"Entschiedenen Linken\\" leftists to institute an elected imperial ruler for a fixed term (any German could stand for election). In further votes, only 97 deputies voted for a directorate, only 80 for an alternating rulership, 39 for an elected Imperial Sovereign with lifetime tenure, 14 for twelve-year term, 196 for a six-year term, 120 for a three-year term. The only thing a majority of delegates agreed on, was that the Imperial Sovereign should bear the title \\"German Kaiser\\" (Kaiser der Deutschen) and that it should not be hereditary (but also not elected). The deputies at the National Assembly usually consisted of groups named after the inns in which they met. Historical and political terms such as decisive democrats or constitutional liberals, as well as descriptions of sites such as the left, the right, the left-centre, etc. were grouped at the end of 1848 by perhaps the most important individual question in the National Assembly: Greater or Lesser Germany. At the beginning of the National Assembly, it was taken for granted that Austria belonged to Germany. However, much of the Austrian state was outside the German Confederation, whose borders were, in principle, also those of the new German Empire. Even in Austria within the imperial borders, many people lived without a German mother tongue. If Germany were to become a national state, Austria had to decide either * Greater German Solution - Austria is divided into a German and a non-German part. The Austrian Emperor could remain head of state in both areas but they must have separate constitutions and administrations. * Lesser German Solution - Austria remains outside of Germany, with which it is linked by a kind of state bond. In order for the plans of Austria being included in the Empire, Austria made a dash on 3 March 1849. On 11 March, the National Assembly learned that the Austrian emperor had signed a new constitution. Austria had become a single overall state, and, as a whole, wanted to join a covenant which had a directorate, but not an actual popular representation. = Decisive votes and imperial election = The right-liberals of the Casino faction were mostly for a hereditary emperor. They wanted to choose the Prussian King. This hereditary party had the majority of the Constitutional Committee but not in the entire National Assembly. The Germans gathered in the Mainlust guest house and the news from Vienna took the wind out of their sails. One of their leaders, Carl Theodor Welcker, swung into the camp of Weidensbusch. On 12 March, he surprisingly proposed that the constitutional consultations were completed quickly: * Outside forces tried to interfere with German constitutional development * The entire present imperial constitution on its first reading, taking into account the wishes of the governments, was to be adapted as a whole in a single decision. The later Reichstag would have to be improved. * German-Austria may at any time join the German Federal State. Welcker's request was rejected by 283 votes (right, left) against 252 (middle). The Reichsministerium resigned but remained in office. Heinrich Simon and the managing minister of the Empire, Heinrich von Gagern succeeded in organising a majority for the content of the Welcker's request (Pact - Simon-Gagern). A group of hereditary emperors supported the Democratic right to vote, the left group, however, against hereditary emperors. On 22 March, deputy Bernhard Eisenstuck asked for the vote on individual paragraphs, but proposals for improvement were only accepted if they were supported by at least 50 deputies. The last section of the Imperial Report was to be voted on. The request was accepted. In the following polls, two important decisions were made on 27 March: * On the Area of the Empire: The separation of German and non-German countries (which related to Austria) was somewhat milder and reformulated into a set-point. Nevertheless, it remained that Austria could not join as a whole state. Because of the well-known attitude of the Austrian government, Austria was excluded de facto. * On the Imperial Sovereign: the deputies decided by a vote of 279-255 that the title of Imperial sovereign was to be transferred to a F√ºrst. By 267-263, deputies decided that the title would be hereditary. The majority for the hereditary emperor's title came about because four Austrians joined the Germans in protest against the Austrian government. The Lesser German Solution was supported by the centre, parts of the left (Simon-Gagern Pact) as well as some on the right. On 28 March, the National Assembly voted Prussian King Frederick Wilhelm IV as emperor. 290 voted for him, 284 abstained, 29 were absent. The abstentions came mainly from the Greater Germans and the majority of the left. = Imperial Constitution of Frankfurt from 28 March 1849 = Constitutional chart for the Frankfurt Imperial Constitution of 1849 The Constitution of the German Empire of 28 March 1849 begins with a long definition of the Empire and contains a long list of the jurisdictional privileges at the Empire level versus those of the individual states. This was followed by Article III regarding the Imperial Sovereign (in sections 68-84). The title of the imperial sovereign is \\"German Kaiser\\". According to section 68, the \\"title of the imperial sovereign is [...] transferred to one of the ruling F√ºrsts\\", without expressly saying who actually carries out the transfer. The following paragraph then states that the Feurst in question passes the title on to his first-born son. His civil list (his income) is determined by the Reichstag. According to the Imperial Constitution, the emperor's powers were: * Appointing the Reichsminister * Representing the Empire internationally, appointing diplomats, etc. * Calling and closing of the Reichstag, dissolving the Volkshaus (according to certain rules) * Promulgation of laws, legislative initiative, postponing veto of the law * Pardon and punishment in criminal matters in the competence of the Reichsgericht * Preservation of imperial peace (against unrest) and disposition over the armed forces * Employment of civil servants * Power of government in all matters of the Empire, insofar as the constitution does not assign individual powers from the Reichsgewalt to other bodies. The emperor was inviolable or irresponsible so he could not be deposed or politically brought to justice. In order to exercise his office, he had to take an oath to the constitution. The legacy of a deceased emperor would have been permanently refused if a regency had been the only possible solution. Moreover, the emperor could only exercise his office if his actions were signed by a minister of the Empire (countersigned). Whom he appointed Reichsminister was once again in the Emperor's personal decision. The constitution does not say anything about the Reichsregierung, the Reichsministerium or its internal organisation. Even if the emperor dismisses the government, it is not explicitly stated, but had to be interpreted. The Reichministers were responsible but the constitution does not explain what the content of the responsibility was. The Reichstag has rights to control the government, according to the right of citation of the Reichstag with the government's obligation to provide information. But there is a lack of a vote of mistrust. According to Huber, the parliamentary system was denied, at least formally. But if the German Empire had been established, the government system would have been parliamentary, also because the Reichsministers were allowed to belong to the Volkshaus at the same time.

Cholak (March 17, 1930 ‚Äì October 31, 2002) was an American professional wrestler better known by his ring name Moose Cholak. Cholak competed in North American regional promotions from 1952 until 1987, primarily in the Midwest and northeast. The nearly 400-lb Cholak was known for wearing a moose head to the ring and giving a \\"moose call\\" prior to his matches. Career A native of Chicago's Southeast Side, Cholak was an all-city wrestling champion and an AAU amateur champion at Chicago Vocational High School. Cholak played tackle for the University of Wisconsin football team, but left after one year to join the Navy during the Korean War. In addition to boxing and wrestling in the service, he was also trained as SeaBee engineer. After leaving the Navy in 1952, Cholak was recruited into professional wrestling by former AWA World Heavyweight champion, Chief Don Eagle. Cholak was trained by Columbus, Ohio promoter and former NWA vice president, Al Haft. Alt URL Between 1953 and 1987, Cholak wrestled in 8,000 matches. Cholak's moose gimmick and finishing move \\"El Squasho\\" as well as the big splash finishing move made him a star in the early years of televised wrestling, including Wrestling from Marigold and Wrestling from the International Amphitheater that both originated from Chicago. Among his many singles and tag-team championships, Cholak won the International Wrestling Association championship in Japan in 1963, defeating Rikidozan. Later life From 1976 to 1996, Cholak supplemented his wrestling income by working as an engineer for Chicago's Streets and Sanitation Department. On nights and weekends when he wasn't booked to wrestle, Cholak also worked in his family's tavern, Calumet Beach Inn. Cholak met Arlene, his wife of 45 years, at the tavern. Eventually weighing over 400 pounds, Cholak died of complications from a stroke on October 31, 2002 in a Hammond, Indiana hospital at the age of 72.

As of September 2017 the database totaled 9,840 items. They range over the fields of history, literature, language, art, philosophy, and recreational mathematics. The associated Futility Closet Podcast is a weekly podcast hosted by Greg and his wife Sharon Ross. It presents curious and little-known events and people from history, and poses logical puzzles.  History  In January 2005, Greg Ross started the Futility Closet website, an online wunderkammer of trivia, quotations, mathematical curiosities, chess problems, and other diversions. The site has spawned two printed collections, and continues to be updated daily. Gary Antonick of the New York Times' Numberplay blog described the first book as \\"the literary equivalent of Trader Joe's Tempting Trail Mix\\". Futility Closet has sometimes been a conduit or used to popularize results by John H. Conway, Richard K. Guy, Lee Sallows, Solomon W. Golomb, and many other well-known mathematicians when they dabbled in recreational mathematics.Conway‚Äôs RATS Sequence Futility Closet: Science & Math, March 30, 2017Golomb Rulers Futility Closet: Science & Math, November 12, 2014A Clueless Crossword by Lee Sallows Futility Closet: Science & Math, February 14, 2018 Puzzles from Futility Closet have frequently been featured in the New York Times puzzle section and the New York Times blog. Futility Closet was recommended by the Honduran newspaper La Tribuna. Its puzzles and paradoxes have been cited by El Pa√≠s and Il Post.  Podcast  In March 2014 Futility Closet launched a thirty-minute weekly podcast hosted by Greg and Sharon Ross. A typical episode lasts thirty minutes and consists of three segments: first the week's core topic, typically a curious story from history; second, listener mail; third, a lateral thinking puzzle, posed by one of the hosts for the other to solve. Some episodes depart from this format, for instance by presenting several short items or open questions culled from research, or by presenting several puzzles in lieu of other content. Many earlier episodes include an advertisement. Most episodes also include a reference to Sasha, the Futility Closet cat until the cat died in 2020. = Content and sources = The podcast has a wide scope and is not restricted to any particular era, but most episodes concern colorful personalities and strange events from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Victorian oddities are a mainstay of the show, as are unexplained mysteries, forteana, hoaxes and impostors, sensational murders, remarkable animals, and the adventures of mariners, aviators, and explorers. Subjects are often prompted by listener suggestions. = Music = The podcast's opening theme is an instrumental bass composition, \\"Fallen Star\\", which was written and performed by Doug Ross, brother of Greg. Doug Ross also supplies the bass riffs that punctuate the transitions between episode segments. = Reception = The Futility Closet Podcast has been praised by James Harkin of No Such Thing as a Fish,https://soundcloud.com/nosuchthingasafish/episode-131-no-such- thing-as-walking-the-life-jacket and by economist Tim Harford. Joshua Gelernter of The Weekly Standard described Futility Closet as \\"one of the most interesting websites on the internet.\\" Michael F√∂rtsch of Wired.de named the Futility Closet Podcast as one of seven podcasts to make you smarter. The podcast was praised by Colin Patrick of Mental Floss, by Jennifer K. Bauer of Inland360.com, and by Kayla Matthews of Makeuseof.com, who praised Greg Ross's scrupulous research. Gizmodo's Robbie Gonzalez praised the site's lateral thinking puzzles. Futility Closet was praised by Steve Dodson of the linguistics blog Languagehat, and was cited by the linguist Ben Yagoda at the Lingua Franca blog. Futility Closet's segment on the Canadian candy boycott was featured on CBC Radio. = Support = At the time of its launch, the podcast was supported chiefly by advertisements and one-time donations. By the end of 2014 a Patreon campaign had been established.

She studied Korean literature at Ewha Womans University and went on to earn her master's degree at the same university. She has also written several collections of critical essays, including Parody sihak (Ìå®Îü¨Îîî ÏãúÌïô Poetics of Parody) (1997) and Cheon gaeui hyeoreul gajin siui eoneo (Ï≤ú Í∞úÏùò ÌòÄÎ•º Í∞ÄÏßÑ ÏãúÏùò Ïñ∏Ïñ¥ The Language of Poetry Has a Thousand Tongues) (1999).  Life  Jeong was born in Naju, South Korea in 1964. In 1983, she graduated Myeongji Girls‚Äô High School and enrolled in Ewha Womans University. She completed her Korean Language and Literature degree in 1987. She received her master‚Äôs and doctoral degrees at Ewha in 1989 and 1994 respectively. She made her literary debut in 1988 when her poem ‚ÄúCaleui bada‚Äú (ÏπºÎ†àÏùò Î∞îÎã§ Sea of Calais) appeared in the journal Monthly Literature & Thought. In 1989, her critical essay ‚ÄúSeoneulhan parodistui jeolmanggwa mosaek‚Äú (ÏÑúÎäòÌïú Ìå®Î°úÎîîÏä§Ìä∏Ïùò Ï†àÎßùÍ≥º Î™®ÏÉâ A Cold Parodist‚Äôs Despair and Inquiry) won the Dong-a Ilbo New Writer's Contest. Her poetry collections include Jajaknamu nae insaeng (ÏûêÏûëÎÇòÎ¨¥ ÎÇ¥ Ïù∏ÏÉù My Life, a Birch Tree) (1996), Huinchek (Ìù∞Ï±Ö White Book) (2000), Samcheongabja boksabit (ÏÇºÏ≤úÍ∞ëÏûê Î≥µÏÇ¨Îπõ 180,000 Years and the Color Peach) (2005), Warak (ÏôÄÎùΩ Bursting) (2008), and Euneuniga (ÏùÄÎäîÏù¥Í∞Ä Subject Markers and Topic Markers) (2014). She has also written several collections of critical essays, including Parody Sihak (Ìå®Îü¨Îîî ÏãúÌïô Poetics of Parody) (1997), which systematically discusses theories on parody and analyzes them in the context of modern Korean poetry, thereby defining the role and meaning of parody in literature. Another collection, entitled Cheon gaeui hyeoreul gajin siui eoneo (Ï≤ú Í∞úÏùò ÌòÄÎ•º Í∞ÄÏßÑ ÏãúÏùò Ïñ∏Ïñ¥ The Language of Poetry Has a Thousand Tongues) (1999), takes an open-minded approach to criticism and reflects on the infinite linguistic possibilities of poetry. Since 2002, she has variously served as researcher at The Society of Ewha Korean Language & Literature, adjunct professor at the Creative Writing department of Chugye University for the Arts, honorary professor at the Korean Language and Literature department of Ewha Womans University, and assistant professor at the Practical Language and Literature department (creative writing major) of Open Cyber University. In 2004, she was awarded the Yushim Award by the Society for the Promotion and Practice of Manhae's Thoughts. In 2008, she won the Sowol Poetry Award for ‚ÄúKeunakeun jam‚Äú (ÌÅ¨ÎÇòÌÅ∞ Ïû† Vast Sleep). She has been teaching Korean language and literature at Ewha Womans University and Myongji University since she was appointed to the professorships in 2014. She participated in the 2015 East Asia Literature Forum.  Writing  Jeong is known for describing sceneries rich with imagery and rhythm. She explores a wide range of motifs, including: flowers, trees, the earth and stars; periods and eons; daughters, fathers, and families; and the everyday lives of nameless men and women. Some poems are plaintive or lonesome, while others are cheerful or compassionate. Some have a reflective tone, while in others the poet‚Äôs voice is stronger. Some focus on describing a situation, while others draw in readers with evocative language. Despite having such a wide range, Jeong‚Äôs poems always carry a hint of warmth and love. She writes about love, family, people, and the universe with imagination, mirth, and pathos. In her early works, Jeong turns the primal human emotion of solitude into images of nature. More recently, her poems contemplate on love, life, and language. Her two latest poetry collections are entitled Warak and Euneuniga. The term ‚Äúwarak‚Äù can either denote the action of bursting into tears or the sound of hugging someone tightly. ‚ÄúEun-neun-i-ga‚Äù refers to the main four nominative case markers in the Korean language. The title Warak implies her intent to write natural poetry while variously using the term as a mimetic word and onomatopoeia. Meanwhile, the title Euneuniga reflects her aspirations to capture even the slightest nuances of her emotions and thoughts, including the subtle differences between the four nominative case markers. Accordingly, Jeong‚Äôs recent poems have increasingly employed an array of onomatopoeia, mimetic words, adverbs, and other such devices.

History The label was started in 1956 by Michael Stillman of Leeds Music and Rose Rubin. They founded the label to provide music to Americans from the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. Rubin and Stillman both served as company President at different points. Monitor was created to focus on classical and folk. The first issues were from the Soviet Union featuring works by Bach and Prokofiev performed by Leonid Kogan and Sviatoslav Richter. For the first year, all issues were sourced from Russia, but in 1957 the label began recording young American artists. Monitor Records were available through the Diners Club record club from 1959 to 1961, an arrangement made out of \\"desperation\\" by Monitor management according to Rubin. Monitor releases first became available on reel-to-reel tapes in 1963 through an agreement with Musictapes, Inc. That year Monitor became distributed worldwide through Transglobal Music. In 1966, Monitor began a budget series called \\"Monitor Collectors Series\\". At introduction, the series consisted of more than one-hundred releases. The primary focus was on Baroque music. In 1967, Monitor became the first label to release music in North America by composer Josef Mysliveƒçek. The label attempted to make an entry into the popular music field when they released singles and an album by The Freeborne in 1968. In 1999, Rubin and Stillman donated the label and its catalog to Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. Although Folkways was already strong in most folk music, it felt that the Monitor acquisition filled their gap in belly dance music.

Knox-Goodrich (1825‚Äì1903) was a women's rights activist who worked for women's suffrage in California in the late nineteenth century. Her first husband, William Knox, was a business man, banker, and state politician. Her second husband, Levi Goodrich, was an architect in Southern California. Knox- Goodrich used her wealth and her social position to push for equal employment, school suffrage, and voting rights.  Biography  Sarah Louise Browning was born in Culpepper County, Virginia, U.S., on February 14, 1825,Munro-Fraser 1881, pp. 767‚Äì769 the daughter of William Winston Browning and Sarah Smith Farrow. When Sarah was 11, her family moved to a farm in Lincoln County, Missouri. = Marriage to William James Knox = William James Knox was born October 20, 1820, near Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky, and moved at an early age to Lincoln County, Missouri. He attended the Louisville Medical Institute in Louisville, Kentucky, and earned his medical degree in 1847.Munro-Fraser 1881, pp. 765‚Äì767 Sarah Browning and William Knox were married on April 1, 1846. On April 12, 1850, they left Missouri, together with Sarah's sister, and traveled by wagon train to Nevada City, California. Knox and four partners built the South Yuba Canal and made a fortune selling water to gold miners during the California gold rush. In 1854, Knox was elected to the California Assembly. In 1862, the Knox's moved to San Francisco and then to San Jose in 1864. Knox and his brother-in-law, T. Ellard Beans, opened Santa Clara County's first bank in 1866; it was called Knox & Beans, Bankers, then renamed Bank of San Jose. Knox served as the bank's first president. In 1865, Knox was elected State Senator for Santa Clara county. He was an early supporter of women's rights and, in 1866, introduced Senate Bill No. 252 that gave married women the right to control their own estate. The bill read: \\"Any married woman may dispose of all her estate by will, absolutely, without the consent of her husband, either express or implied, and may alter or revoke the same in like manner\\". The bill was passed. Knox died in San Francisco on November 13, 1867. William and Sarah had one child, Virginia, who married Cabel H. Maddox of San Francisco. Maddox was elected to the state senate in 1882. = Marriage to Levi Goodrich = Levi Goodrich was born in New York City on January 1, 1822. He studied architecture in the studio of R. G. Hatfield in New York before moving to San Jose in 1849.Munro-Fraser 1881, pp. 759‚Äì760 Goodrich was one of the first licensed architects in California. The buildings he designed include the Santa Clara County Courthouse and jail, the State Normal School, the Bank of San Jose, and the courthouses of Monterey and San Diego counties. Sarah Knox and Goodrich married on January 15, 1879, and Sarah adopted a hyphenated form of both husband's names, Knox-Goodrich. Goodrich died in 1886 in San Diego. Suffragist activities Knox-Goodrich had wealth and social position, and used them both in state campaigns for equal employment, school suffrage, protests of taxation without representation, and voting rights. Clara Shortridge Foltz, the first female lawyer on the West Coast, said of her, \\"Mrs. Knox is a widow of commanding personal appearance, an abundance of bank stock, and a wealth of . . . common sense, which she displayed at the polls on last Wednesday by protesting against 'taxation without representation.'\\" Knox-Goodrich worked with her first husband in getting the Senate Bill 252 passed in the state legislature. In 1869, she organized San Jose's first Women's Suffrage Association; by 1876, it had 200 members. On the Fourth of July in 1876, Knox, \\"determined to make a manifestation\\", filled her carriage with prominent friends carrying signs that read \\"We are the disfranchised Class\\", \\"We are Taxed without being Represented\\", and \\"We are governed without our Consent\\". She had requested a position at the back of the parade, next to the African-Americans but ahead of the Chinese immigrants, as an illustration of women's legal position, but the parade organizers insisted on her carriage being placed at the front. In 1874, Knox-Goodrich spearheaded a bill making women eligible to run for educational office, such as school boards, even though they could not vote. She, and her co-lobbyists, traveled to Sacramento and stayed there for a month, supporting the passage of the bill in the State Assembly. In 1877, Knox-Goodrich nominated herself for an Assembly seat. In 1880, she petitioned the Assembly for relief from political disabilities: The petition failed. Knox-Goodrich was an officer in the California Suffrage Constitutional Amendment Campaign Association (formed in 1895) and the joint campaign committee (formed in 1896). Both committees were formed to direct and support the campaign to amend the California state constitution, giving women the vote. Knox-Goodrich hosted Susan B. Anthony at her home, and then accompanied Anthony to Sacramento as a member of the woman suffrage delegation for the state Republican convention. In addition to these activities, Knox-Goodrich donated money to women's rights causes. In 1888, she donated money for the founding meeting of the International Council of Women. She gave $100 to help clear the debt from the 1895 women's suffrage campaign and $500 to fund the 1896 constitutional amendment campaign. She also contributed to travel and expenses of other women working for women's suffrage. In 1889, Knox-Goodrich and Ellen Clark Sargent paid for Laura de Force Gordon, a journalist and leader of the California Women's Suffrage Society, to give a series of lectures in the Washington Territory. Knox-Goodrich was a frequent contributor to Women's Journal, the San Jose Mercury, and the New Northwest. Knox-Goodrich Building Knox- Goodrich commissioned a building on property left to her by her first husband. The building, designed by George W. Page, was commercial on the first floor and a rooming house on the second and third floors. Its Romanesque Revival features include rusticated masonry walls, massive stone piers, carved stone detailing, and Byzantine capitals. There is a parapet over the third-floor windows with a carved 'G' and a 'K' intertwined, and the date '1889' is carved over the second story windows. A plaque on the building states, In addition to the Knox-Goodrich Building, the Goodrich quarry provided stone for the construction of Stanford University and an early San Jose City Hall. Knox- Goodrich died on October 30, 1903, at her home, leaving an estate worth more than $500,000. She is buried between her two husbands.

Fr√©mont of Virginia. History =Background= The expansionist movement of the 1840s motivated many Americans to work to push America's borders out into land claimed by Spain, Mexico, Britain, and Native American tribes. \\"Manifest Destiny\\", a term coined by journalist John O'Sullivan, captured the idea that the young American nation was destined to rule all of the North American continent. Democratic Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri was a prominent leader of this movement, into which he enlisted his son-in-law, John C. Fr√©mont. Benton obtained government funding for several expeditions led by Fr√©mont to map and explore the western territory. In 1845, Captain Fr√©mont was sent by the War Department on an expedition to survey the Great Basin and Alta California, a possession of Mexico. Upon arriving in California, Fr√©mont and his men moved about the northern half of the state for several months, provoking the Mexican authorities and building up patriotic sentiment among Americans who had settled there. They briefly left the state in April 1846 under pressure from Mexican authorities, committing the Sacramento River massacre on their way out of the state and the Klamath Lake massacre after leaving it. A message from the American government implying war with Mexico was imminent led Fr√©mont and his men to return to California in late May. =Incident= On 30 May 1846, the band arrived at the Sutter Buttes and set up camp there, planning to take Sutter Fort and raise the American flag. While encamped, Fr√©mont heard rumors that local Indians were preparing an attack on settlers. He took movements of Indian groups and the upcoming harvest as \\"signs\\" that the time for the attack was nearing, and stated in his memoirs that he chose to attack them preemptively. Fr√©mont admits that his goal was to terrorize the Indians into submission and that he ordered his men to \\"leave no enemy behind.\\" In the morning he and his armed men approached a rancheria near the location of modern-day Meridian, California. They attacked without warning and killed several Indians, though others escaped. Those killed were likely Patwin people of the Wintun. Fr√©mont's band then proceeded to other rancherias and attempted to attack them as well, but word had spread and the Indians across the land were already fleeing. =Repercussions= Neither Fr√©mont nor any of his expedition members were charged or punished in any way for the killings. Fr√©mont claimed afterwards that his attack \\"put an end to the intended attack upon the whites\\" and that the Indians were kept on \\"good behavior\\" by fear of him. Aftermath In July 1846, Fr√©mont moved on to Sutter Fort and raised the American flag. By August 1846 American military officers had fully occupied the northern half of the state, and by December all of modern California was under American control. John C. Fr√©mont became Military Governor of California in January 1847, but was forced to give up the position less than two months later under disputed circumstances. In 1850 Fr√©mont became California's first U.S. Senator. Fr√©mont, who had become wealthy off of gold mining claims, wrote a bill limiting gold mining claims to White citizens of the United States. In 1856 Fr√©mont was nominated as the Republican candidate for President, losing the race to James Buchanan. He later fought as a Union general during the Civil War. By the time Fr√©mont had arrived in the Sacramento River Valley, wealthy landed settlers were beginning to depend on Indian labor in a sort of feudal system, with the Indians working both as free and as bonded labor. To some degree this saved the local Wintu from immediate annihilation, though the stealing of land, rape, and slave raids were common. By the 1850s, White American animosity at Indian possession of the land had built, and large-scale massacres involving hundreds of Wintu deaths commenced, including the Kabyai Creek massacre, the Old Shasta Town massacre and the Bridge Gulch massacre.

In the Middle Ages until 1497 the manor of Moulsford was a principal seat of the prominent Carew family,Royal Berkshire History: Moulsford Manor also seated at Carew Castle in Pembrokeshire and later at Mohuns Ottery in Devon. Descent of the manor =Norman Conquest= The manor of Moulsford is not listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 and is believed at that time to have been included within the royal manor of Cholsey. =Carew= age of heraldry (circa 1200-15): Or, three lions passant in pale sableDebrett's Peerage, 1968, Carew Baronets, p.155; Baron Carew p.216; These were the arms shown on the seal of Nic(olae)us de Carru (c.1255‚Äì1311), appended to the Barons' Letter, 1301 and blazoned in the 1301 Caerlaverock Roll of Arms The descent of the manor in the Carew family was as follows: Gerald de Windsor (c.1075-1135) Gerald de Windsor (c.1075-1135)(alias Gerald FitzWalter, Gerald son of Walter), Constable of Pembroke Castle in the Kingdom of Deheubarth, Wales, who received Moulsford by grant of King Henry I (1100-1135).VCH He was the husband of Nesta ferch Rhys (c.1085, d.pre-1136), the mistress of King Henry I and the only legitimate daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr (before 1065 ‚Äì 1093), Prince of Wales,Vivian, p.133 the last King of Deheubarth in Wales, by his wife Gwladys ferch Rhiwallon ap Cynfyn of Powys. The Carew's seat of Carew Castle, Pembrokeshire, was in the Kingdom of Deheubarth. He was the second son of Walter FitzOther, Constable of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, a principal royal residence, by his wife Gladys ap Conwyn, daughter of Rywallon ap Conwym, Prince of North Wales.

History Claus Daa, who owned Ravnstrup 1600-1641 and was appointed to Admiral of the Realm in 1631 Ravnstrup has existed since the 14th century. The first known owner was Esbern Pedersen Krumpen who owned the estate from 1396 to 1407. His son, Jens Esbernsen Krumpens. inherited Tavnstrup in 1407. He had no sons and when he died in 1438 Ravnstrup was therefore passed on to his son-in-law, Herluf Nielsen Snekken, who was married to Jens Esbernsen Krumpens datter Gyde Krumpen. They had no sons either and Ravnstrup was therefore passed on to their son-in-law Claus Daa through his marriage to their daughter Dorthe Herlugsdatter Snekken. Claus Daa, a knight and member of the Privy Council, owned Ravnstrup until his death in 1496 and the estate would after that remain at the hands of the Daa family for almost another 200 years. His son, Olud Daa, was the owner from, 1496-1532. His son, was also called Claus Daa, was the owner from 1496 to 1532. His son, Oluf Daa, who was the owner from 1496 to¬¥1532, constructed a new two-storey main building in 1595. Through his marriage he also acquired another manor in the area, Holmegaard. His son, Claus Daa, took over both estates after his father's death in 1600. He became a major landowner after also acquiring the estates of Borreby and Fraugdegaard through his marriage to Dorthe Friis in 1618. He also expanded the Ravnstrup estate by buoying up more land in the area and purchased Herlufmagle Church where he constructed a chapel. He was appointed to Admiral of the Realm by Christian IV. Christian Daa, his oldest surviving son by his second wife, who was the queen's avener, inherited Tavnstrup, Borreby and Fraugdegaard in 1641. He was ruined during the Swedish Wars and had to pledge his estate which was taken over by Erik Krag, Oluf Rosenkrantz and Mathias Worm in 1668 and son thereafter sold to Anders Jespersen Engberg. He once again expanded the estate through the acquisition of more land prior to his death in 1690. Tavnstrup was then passed on to his son-in-law Hector Gottfried Masius, a prominent theologian. He became the owner of several estates in the area. He died in 1709 and his children were ennobled by letters patent in 1712 with the name von der Maase. His son Christian von der Maase increased the number of tenant farms before selling the estate to Jacob Hjort in 1719. Ravnstrup in 1712 Friis sold the estate to Christian von der Maase's brother Frederiks con der Maase the following year. That same year he sold it to Edele Cathrine Kaas, the widow of Valentin von Eickstedt. The following year married Caspar Wessel, Tordenskjold's brother, who then became the owner. It was difficult times for Danish agriculture and Wessel had to sell Ravnstrup in 1740 to pay off his debts. In 1747, Ravnstrup was acquired by Niels de Hofman. He acquired more land and improved the buildings. In 1760, he sold Ravnstrup to count Eggert Christopher Knuth Oluf Daa's main building as it appeared before the fire In 1768, Ravnstrup was sold in auction to J√∏rgen Mauritsen. In 1778 he had to sell the estate. The buyer was Frederik Wilhelm Wedel-Jarlsberg who sold it to Conrad Danneskiold-Sams√∏e. He was a strong supporter of the agricultural reforms of the time and made many contributions to the area. His widow, Johanne Henriette Valentine Kaas, ran the estate after her husband's death. In 1844, Ravnstrup was sold in auction to Gustav Gr√ºner, who acquired it for his son Georg Johan R√∏bye Gr√ºner. Ravnstrup changed hands many times after his death in 1890. In 1929, G.C. Jessen sold the main building and park to G. Howden-R√∏nnenkamp. He rented it out as a summer camp. The main building was destroyed in a fire in 1947. It was then rebuilt to a smaller design and sold toB. Wejdling. Architecture Oluf Daa's main building from 1494 was a two- storey building constructed in red brick but it was rebuilt to a new design by Ole Hagen after the fire in 1947. It is now a one-storey building with a detached octagonal tower at its southeastern corner. Estate The garden is located to the southeast of the main building and slopes down towards a small lake. To the northwest of the main building is a courtyard surrounded by farm buildings.

The island is an area of raised ground approximately 180 metres by 80 metres amid the tidal sands between the channels of Sweare Deep and Emsworth Channel.Ordnance Survey of Great Britain The island has appeared on maps since at least 1791 when it featured on Milne's map of the area. Fisherman's Walk Fisherman's Walk is a causeway that runs along the sands from the coast at Emsworth around 340 metres to Fowley Rithe, a narrow channel that runs 200 metres to the north east of Fowley Island. The causeway was depicted on a chart of 1848 but was absent in an earlier 1826 map, suggesting that it was constructed between those dates. In the Ordnance Survey map of 1866 it is labelled 'Westwood's Road'. The causeway is believed to have been created to support oyster farming, though the first historical record of this dates from only 1885 when the Fowley Island Oyster Company began. Although the causeway does not reach Fowley Island, and no historical maps show it doing so, it may still have been possible to walk from the causeway to the island on the eel grass that once filled the water bed. The reduction in eel grass over the last century means that such a crossing is no longer possible. Fishermen would have taken a horse and cart across the causeway to Fowley Island and stored oysters in large ponds that they had dug there before taking them back for sale. The Ordnance Survey map of 1898 shows two such oyster beds on Fowley Island, activity which has resulted in the island's distinctive present shape. The effort required to create a causeway of this size shows the commercial importance of the oyster industry to Emsworth. The industry took a serious hit in 1902 after William Stephens, the Dean of Winchester, and several other diners died from typhoid after a dinner at which Emsworth oysters were served. An investigation blamed sewage contamination of the oyster beds and Emsworth oyster sales were banned until 1914. The industry restarted after the First World War but never recovered its former success. Other uses for the causeway have included salterns (evaporation pools used for harvesting salt) along its western side, as shown on the Ordnance Survey map of 1952, and the eastern side formerly supported poles probably for securing boats.

Then the Chieftain returns to the bank where she has a plan to kidnap the junior Troubadour. For this she calls the Genius Detective, and he goes in search of the young Troubadour. Troubadour Jr. is studying at the Music Academy and does not know about his origin. The Donkey, the Dog, the Cat, and the Rooster try to teach him \\"classical music,\\" but Troubadour Jr. dreams of \\"singing rock'n'roll\\" (although this criticism is puzzling, because the music that the quartet performs is in fact this). After offending the academicians, he remains alone and begins to dream of adventure. Immediately in front of him appears Sergeant and reveals the secret of his origin. Then he suggests to Troubadour Jr. to go to the grandfather King, to which Troubadour Jr. agrees. After meeting with him, the King cheers up and throws a ball in honor of the heir. During the ball, three robbers of the Chieftain, clad in servant costumes, catch Troubadour Jr., after lulling everyone with a tarragon containing sleeping aid. Together with the Detective, they deliver him to the bank and lock him in a safe. In the palace they leave a note from Chieftain: \\"Either marry me tomorrow or say goodbye to your grandson!\\". The king immediately raises his entire guard and makes charge against the bank \\"Byaki- Buki\\". Together with the guards, the Bremen musicians also go to attack. But when they approach the bank, they are met by the Syllabus, who is an expert on martial arts. After the defeat, the musicians decide to develop a new plan. The Princess comes up with one and everyone agrees with her. The King sends a telegram to the Chieftain with the consent. The next day a wedding cortege arrives at the palace. From it appears Chieftain in veil, and behind her are the robbers carrying a bag containing the hostage. She is met by the Dog, the Donkey, the Cat and the Rooster who deliver strange verses. And while they distract the Chieftain, the Dog changes bags. Everyone is waiting for the King to show up and suddenly he appears dressed in a dressing gown, slippers and without a wig. He declares that he agrees to marry her, but refuses power and transfers the crown to his grandson. Angered by the fact that her plan fell apart, the Chieftain shouts to the King to leave. Suddenly, Troubadour Jr. appears wearing the crown and mantle and orders the guards to arrest the Robbers, Chieftain and the Detective. The confounded robbers untie the sack from which the Cat jumps out. The door opens and from there comes out a huge knight's armor (on closer inspection it turns out that the Donkey, Dog and Rooster are wearing the armor), threateningly approaching the kidnappers. They, in fear, run away to the jubilation of the crowd. Everyone is happy, and the young Troubadour refuses the crown and receives a guitar as a gift from his father. He finds himself new musician friends: young Donkey, Dog, Cat and Rooster (who all become the animals' apprentices). They leave with Troubadour Jr. for new adventures.

The series follows Drake Parker (Drake Bell) after Walter Nichols (Jonathan Goldstein) escaped from the Drake & Josh set into the real world. Viewers were encouraged to share any information they found by using the hashtag #WheresWalter on social networks. Although it shares the same characters and settings of Drake & Josh, there is no confirmed involvement of Dan Schneider, original series creator and executive producer. It is later revealed that Walter saw Audrey Parker-Nichols (Nancy Sullivan) having lunch with Bruce Winchill, Walter's rival weatherman, in a San Diego park. Out of anger, he punches out a wall in his room, revealing that it's actually a set piece in the Nickelodeon studios. He runs away quickly, and accidentally bumps into Devon Werkheiser, who mistakes him for Johnathan Goldstein. On the streets of Los Angeles, Craig & Eric kidnap Walter and take him to their real world hideout. Eric takes his phone and places it into a microwave oven before they talk to him. He explains that OmniCorp, a multi-conglomerate who owns all the networks and studios, cloned Hollywood actors to be used in their shows. He then compares the likenesses of Eric & Scott Halberstadt, Craig & Alec Medlock, Helen & Yvette Nicole Brown, and Walter & Johnathan Goldstein, much to his surprise. They warn him to go back, because it would be a better life to live in than in the real world, but Walter storms out of the hideout.Where's Walter...In The Beginning (A Prequel) Sometime after these events, Drake Parker posted some videos containing cell phone footage of Walter in a poncho rummaging through trash, stealing food, and sleeping on the ground.Drake and Josh's Dad Is Missing For the effort, Helen (Yvette Nicole Brown), Audrey Parker-Nichols (Nancy Sullivan), Lenny Spodnick the Foam Finger Guy (Fred Stoller), fans from \\"South Amereeka\\", and Josh Sussman posted videos and handed out flyers to help.Helen HelpsFoam Finger GuyMom HelpsSouth Amereeka (America!)Josh (Sussman) Looks For Walter At UCLA In one instance, Drake and Carly are walking in the city and see a poster for The Great Doheny (Steve Tom), a magician that Josh likes.

He is unsuccessful, instead bringing back Gustavo Rocque (Stephen Kramer Glickman), Prompting Drake to whisper \\"Wrong Show\\", and Clayton (Josh Sussman), but he also makes his clothes disappear. Later, he tries again, and as Walter is rummaging through a trash can, he happens to make his head bald.Can Magic Bring Back Walter? After this, it is shown that an OmniCorp agent has been tracking and following Walter.

G. [www.erbzine.com/mag17/Lin_Carter.doc \\"Lin Carter: a Look Behind the Martian Stories.\\"] in ERBzine. It was first published in paperback by Berkley Medallion in October 1977 and in reissued in trade paperback by Wildside Press in December 1999. The first hardcover edition was published by Wildside Press in February 2011. Plot summary Mars, a world with a culture ages older than that of Earth, is a dying world, and has been in decline for eons. By the twenty-second century it has become a colony of the younger civilization of Earth, its natives oppressed by the rapacious Colonial Authority. In Yeolarn, a city divided into Terran and Martian sectors, the Terran Ryker is on the lam from the CA and natives alike. He finds himself attracted to the native dancer Valarda, by whom he is enticed into a local slum. They fall afoul of a mob, who treat Valarda as a hated pariah; Ryker helps her elude them, and with the native boy Kiki they join a caravan departing for the northern desert to further shake their pursuers. Later Valarda and Kiki disappear, along with an antique amulet in Ryker's possession. He trails the thieves to the ruins of Khuu and the Martian \\"sphinx\\", an ancient monument in the form of the insect-like Pteraton; Valarda's enemies also follow. The amulet proves the key to the structure, unlocking a time portal into a prehistoric era. Ryker, Valarda and Kiki are hurled into this past together with their hunters and the captive Terran scientist Herzog. Beyond the portal is Zhiam, the original city whose ruins would one day become Khuu. It is the last refuge of the legendary lost tenth tribe of Mars, Valarda and Kiki's people. Branded devil-worshipping heretics by the nine other nations, it was almost exterminated in the Zhaggua Jihad in ages past. Valarda, the lost tribe's high priestess and last of its rulers, had ventured back into the world to retrieve the key that could betray their hiding place, only to be found out. Now that outsiders have breached the tribe's peaceful retreat, the age-old conflict breaks out anew. The situation is resolved when the lost tribe's \\"devil\\" deity, a benevolent energy being called Zhagguaziu, the Child-of-Stars, intervenes to defeat and expel the intruders. To safeguard its worshippers it seals off the gateway between the prehistoric refuge and modern Mars permanently. It gives its blessing to Ryker and Valarda's mutual passion and instructs them to establish a new dynasty. The implication is that all the modern Martians will be their descendants. Chronology This story was the fourth published in the series, after \\"The Martian El Dorado of Parker Whitley,\\" but in terms of events it comes third, following The Valley Where Time Stood Still. In both instances, it is followed by Down to a Sunless Sea. Reception Den Valdron, assessing the series in ERBzine, rates the book together with The Valley Where Time Stood Still as \\"stand[ing] between\\" The Man Who Loved Mars and Down to a Sunless Sea, which he considers the best and least interesting of the series, \\"but each has their [sic] particular strengths.\\" Over all, he feels \\"[t]here‚Äôs something a little extra in his Martian novels that puts them at the upper registers of Carter‚Äôs work,\\" and \\"commend[s] them to the reader.\\" J. G. Huckenpohler, also writing in ERBzine, rated the series \\"among my favorites\\" of Carter's stories, \\"show[ing] more originality\\" than Carter's Zanthodon and Callisto books. Nonetheless, he \\"found them to be uneven,\\" growing \\"increasingly repetitious, the last two [including \\"City\\"] especially.\\" It shares what he identifies as the sequence's standard plot: \\"[a] Terran outlaw, an older Dok-i-tar, a Martian sidekick, originally an enemy, and a Martian girl find a lost city known only to the oldest legends of the Martians, unlock its secrets, and either remain as its rulers or escape to begin a new life.\\" Notes External links *Fantastic Fiction entry Category:1977 American novels Category:1977 fantasy novels Category:1977 science fiction novels Category:Mars in fiction Category:Novels by Lin Carter Category:Berkley Books books ","title":"The City Outside the World"},{"id":"55016686","text":"The chapters of Japanese manga Inuyashiki are written and illustrated by Hiroya Oku.

Etymology The name Shandon stems from the Irish Sean D√∫n, meaning \\"Old Fort\\". It is believed that this refers to the ringfort of the MacCarthaigh family, who occupied the area around 1000 A.D. History The area was originally developed by the Normans, as a route to the north gate of the city, and rose in prominence due to its proximity to Shandon Castle, the administrative centre of the province of Munster. The area was heavily damaged during the 1690 Siege of Cork, but subsequent rebuilding saw the erection of the landmark St. Anne's Church. The North Cathedral was also erected at the top of Shandon Street in 1624. The present day structure, however, is the fifth church to occupy the site; churches have been rebuilt there numerous times, most recently following an 1820 fire. Commercial activity at this time included a regular cattle market, where large numbers of animals were exported to the West Indies, eastern US, Britain and Canada. In response to a 1582 famine and outbreak of plague, Stephen Skiddy, a Master Vintner, willed funds to build a number of almshouses in the city. One such almshouse, built in the 18th century and referred to as Skiddy's Almshouse, is still standing adjacent to Shandon Street. The 18th century saw the development of the Butter Market in response to the penal laws, which indirectly encouraged commercial ventures among wealthy Catholic families. This led to the foundation of the Committee of Butter Merchants, who, in 1770, instated the inspection of butter exports. The increasing butter trade resulted in Shandon Street becoming an important international trading centre, and a focal point within the city. There was a notable diversity in standards of living in the area, with wealthy retailers living directly on the street, and many tenement halls on the numerous adjoining streets. =Recent development= The closure of the Butter Market in 1924 due to competition from continental Europe led to a period of decline. Recent attempts at reversing the decline include the construction of the Cork Butter Museum and the Firkin Crane theatre. As part of the ‚Ç¨15m Shandon Area Renewal Scheme, in 2004, Shandon Street was redeveloped. This included the renewal of paving and the replacement of derelict buildings with infill housing.

The museum is located in the last remaining building of the Jane Addams Homes of ABLA Homes, and will feature an oral history archive, public programming, and an entrepreneurship hub. Exhibitions will include restored apartment of three families who lived in the Jane Addams homes. The building that the museum is contained within opened in 1938 as the first federal government housing project in Chicago. It housed thousands of families over six decades and has been vacant since 2002  History  The movement for conservation of a public housing building began in the 1990s with the announcement of the Plan for Transformation, a Chicago Housing Authority initiative to demolish 17,000 units of public housing and replace them with mixed-income housing. Residents, led by Deverra Beverly, a former commissioner for the Chicago Housing Authority, began and led the movement for the creation of a memorialization of their presence. Beverly and other public housing residents approached Sunny Fischer, a philanthropy professional and former public housing resident herself, with their proposal for a museum. Along the way, CHA residents were joined by \\"civic leaders, preservationists, historians, and cultural experts who also wanted to create a new architectural landmark to recognize an important historic site.\\" This group came together to preserve and transform the current site of the museum, originally designed by a team of architects led by John Holabird. As the project moved forward, the museum maintained a commitment to uplifting the voices and narratives of public housing residents, and includes public housing residents as about a third of its board.  Exhibits, collections and programming  The mission of the museum is to ‚Äúpromote, interpret, and propel housing as a human right‚Äù . This mission manifests in the museums oral history-focused approach to storytelling and community development and programming. The museum‚Äôs planned exhibitions and collections include an archive of oral histories of public housing residents, three restored apartments of three diverse (One Russian Jewish, one Italian-American, and one African American) families that lived in the public housing based on the oral histories of Inez Medor, members of the Rizzi family, and Marshall Hatch, and a community space for discussion and interpretation. Prior to opening, the museum served largely as a ‚Äúmuseum in the streets‚Äù and hosted events like neighborhood storytelling and poetry readings, beautification projects at the site of the museum, and panels across the country. Most recently, National Public Housing Museum has partnered with Oral History Summer School to help train a group of activists, organizers, students, and artists in how to collect and utilize the medium of oral history, while additionally expanding the museum‚Äôs archival collection of oral histories. The museum has not yet determined if it will devote a significant amount of resources to growing and maintaining a collection. As a member of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, the museum holds a responsibility to not only historicize its focus but also connect the focus to current struggles and initiatives. The museum used the examples of the Apartheid Museum, District Six Museum, the Tenement Museum and the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum as inspiration.

However, although recorded in history as a \\"battle\\"MacLeod. p. 333. there was no actual fighting between the two sides. Instead a large rebel Jacobite force advanced on a position held by a force loyal to the British-Hanoverian Government who were taken by surprise and forced into a retreat. The Jacobite advance was coordinated by James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth at Dornoch, Sutherland.Pollard. p. 32. Background Lord Loudoun (John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun), supporter of the British- Hanoverian Government who was at Dornoch concluded that the Jacobites would attack from across the River Shin (which was West of his position) and that his eastern flank remained secured by the Royal Navy. This was despite warning to the contrary. He decided that the next morning he would ride up to a place called Invershin and he left Dornoch on 20 March between 7 and 8am. Rebel advance At about 8 am the Jacobite rebels prepared to embark from the sands below Tain (which is on the opposite side of the Dornoch Firth to Dornoch). The rebel Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry later wrote that his men struggled all night to re-launch the boats that were stranded by the falling tide.MacLeod. pp. 333‚Äì334. The first division to embark consisted of about 500 men of the Clan Fraser of Lovat and 300 of the Clan Gregor.MacLeod. p. 334. They landed at a place called Meikle Ferry at about 9 am and immediately marched towards Skibo Castle in an attempt to capture Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden, who was a staunch supporter of the government and who was Lord President of the Court of Session and also Norman MacLeod, Laird of MacLeod. The alarm was raised at Dornoch and Lord Loudoun's Regiment known as Loudon's Highlanders beat to arms. Major Mackenzie of Loudoun's Regiment collected 120 men and proceeded down to the ferry where they arrived at about 10 am to find that 1500 rebels had landed. The rebel's second division which consisted of Lochgarry's regiment and also Clanranald's had already landed and the boats were going back for more men. The government-loyal Mackay guard at the boats only consisted of about 40 men and so they retired without firing a shot. Major Mackenzie of Lord Loudoun's regiment also retired without firing and the Jacobite Frasers marched off after them towards Dornoch. The rebel Jacobites had been lucky that the fog had persisted although Lochgarry claimed that it had begun to break up during the landing. The Jacobite rebels' third division consisting of George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie's regiment and the MacDonald of Barrisdale regiment landed at about 11 am. Lord Loudoun's regiment retired through Dornoch and Major Mackenzie sent the Laird of Mackintosh to ask under what terms they would be received as prisoners. Capture of Government forces Captains Alexander Mackay, Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet, Lieutenant Reid and ensigns Alexander Maclaggan and John Grant made good their escape, along with Captain Lord Charles Gordon, Captain John MacLeod and Ensign James Grant of Glenmoriston, with some of the men.MacLeod. pp. 334‚Äì335. According to historian Ruairidh MacLeod the remaining officers who were at Dornoch including the Laird of Mackintosh surrendered with about forty men. However, according to historian Peter Simpson 300 of Loudoun's regiment were taken prisoner but the majority, 900 in all, escaped to the Isle of Skye. The rebels captured four ships at the ferry as well as 700 arms that were meant for Loudoun's Regiment.MacLeod. p. 335. The rebel Jacobite Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry who had previously been commissioned as a lieutenant in Lord Loudoun's Regiment but had gone off with about ¬£300 of Major Mackenzie's money and most of his company was present at the surrender. Retreat of remaining Government forces Captain Alexander Mackay with about 160 men of Lord Loudoun's Regiment arrived about three miles from Lairg that evening. According to Ruairidh MacLeod, Lord Loudoun himself decided to abandon his position and divide his troops: The Mackay and Sutherland men (Independent Highland Companies) were to go north to Lord Reay's country, and this somewhat agrees with Tony Pollard's account that others of Loudoun's regiment escaped to the lands of the Mackays in the far north of Sutherland. MacLeod goes on to say that Lord Loudoun with his own regiment and the rest of the companies would go westwards. The rebels did not press their attack and on 21 March they rendezvoused west of Dornoch. On 22 March the rebels marched off in pursuit of Lord Loudoun but found no one. On 23 March the rebels returned to Skibo and Dornoch and the Duke of Perth returned to Inverness.MacLeod. p. 336. The Earl of Cromartie was left in command at Dornoch. By the 23 March Lord Loudoun had marched sixty miles to Loch Ewe and on 24 March had reached Eddracharron in Strathcarron where Kenneth Mackenzie, Lord Fortrose had a company in support of the Government. According to MacLeod on 26 March Lord Loudoun arrived in Sleat where he would remain for a month. He had with him the Laird of MacLeod and his four companies, Sir Alexander MacDonald who joined with his two companies, George Munro, 1st of Culcairn's company, MacLeod of Geanies' company, the town of Inverness company and a few men of his own regiment commanded by Captain John Stuart, in total about 800 men. However, according to Simpson at Sleat they were reinforced by Alexander MacDonald of Sleat and the 3rd Mackenzie Independent Company, bringing their total number of men to 1300. Aftermath On 25 March 1746 the 1st Mackay Independent Company under Captain George Mackay,Mackay. pp. 190‚Äì191. 2nd Mackay Independent Company under Captain Hugh Mackay, one of the Sutherland Companies and some refugees of Loudon's Highlanders regiment had a notable success at the Skirmish of Tongue,Simpson. p. 135. where money and supplies destined for the Jacobite cause were captured from a French ship,Pollard. p. 34.MacLeod. p. 338. and 156 Jacobites were taken prisoner. In response the Jacobite commander, Charles Edward Stuart, sent a large Jacobite force north under the command of George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie.Simpson. pp. 135‚Äì136. However, they arrived too late to be of any use and were attacked by surprise by the 2nd Sutherland Company under the command of Ensign John Mackay and also the 2nd Mackay Company. This was known as the Battle of Littleferry where the Jacobite force was completely defeated, losing about 100 dead,MacLeod. p. 340. and was prevented from providing much needed support to the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden that took place the next day and which they would have been late for anyway.

It was founded in 1911 by Sam and Mary Middleton as The Gunston Farm School. Gunston draws students from seven Maryland counties - Queen Anne's, Kent, Talbot, Dorchester, Anne Arundel, Cecil, and Caroline - and Delaware. There is also a large international student population that resides near the school with host families from the community. History =The Gunston Farm School= 1911 - 1950s. In response to the effects of their daughter's polio, Sam and Mary Middleton founded The Gunston Farm School in 1911 on their family farm on the Corsica River. The school's traditional curriculum focused on reading, writing, geography, and arithmetic. Athletics were almost exclusively focused on horseback riding as this was considered a crucial activity in developing important character traits. When Samuel Middleton died in 1929, Mary Middleton took over as the sole headmistress of the school. For the next thirty-five years, \\"Aunt Mary\\" developed Gunston from a small tutorial school into a renowned East Coast girls boarding school. =The Gunston School for Girls= 1950s - 1995. Gunston became and all-girls school in the 1950s. When Mary Middleton retired in 1964, the headship of the school briefly passed to Mrs. Okie before she was succeeded by long-serving Headmaster Paul Long. Under Long's nearly two decades of leadership, Gunston experienced significant growth in terms of enrollment, physical plant, and academic reputation. Headmaster Long is also responsible for starting many of Gunston's longstanding traditions such as Green & White Day and Yearbook Day. =The Gunston Day School= 1995 - 2011. Under Headmaster Peter \\"Stick\\" Sturtevant Jr. Gunston was reincorporated as a co-educational day school in response to the national decline in single-sex education. During Sturtevant's time at Gunston, the school began its Bay Studies program devoted to hands-on learning within the surrounding Chesapeake Bay area. The school was led by Jeffrey Wordworth in the early 2000s until his tragic death in 2009. During his time as Headmaster Woodworth oversaw the addition of a crew team, the renovation of Middleton House, and the implementation of an international recruitment effort. His assistant headmaster, Christie Grabis, served as Interim Headmaster from 2009-2010. In July 2010 John Lewis IV was installed as The Gunston School's 8th Headmaster.https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs- xpm-1996-07-15-1996197035-story.html =The Gunston School= 2011 - present. As of August 16, 2011, Gunston Day School was formally reincorporated as The Gunston School. Mission The Gunston School offers an intellectually rigorous, highly personalized, and nurturing college preparatory educational experience. Valuing a healthy balance between mind and body, a strong sense of community, the creative process, and our connection to the Chesapeake Bay, Gunston strives to educate ethically and environmentally minded scholars, citizens, and leaders for our globalized society. Academics The Gunston School's 35-acre waterfront plays an integral role in the school's curriculum and programming. Gunston's small class sizes range from 10-12 students on average with a 9:1 student-to-teacher ratio. There are 29 full and part-time faculty members in their college preparatory program that includes the humanities, science, math, the arts, and athletics. Academic scheduling is highly personalized and tailored to each student's needs and interests. The school year is divided into two semesters with semester exams held in December and June. Gunston requires 24 credits for graduation. Athletics The Gunston School hosts thirteen varsity team sports, five fitness programs, and two junior varsity sports teams. The school has a wide complement of athletic facilities: a 6-court tennis facility, 3 full-size natural grass fields, a field house with a competition-sized basketball court, and the Corsica River with two docks for their sailing and rowing programs. As part of the school's holistic curriculum, all students must participate in a sport or fitness class for two of the three seasons each year.http://www.gunston.org/athletics Fall Sports *Soccer *Field Hockey *Sailing *Crew Winter Sports *Basketball Spring Sports *Crew *Sailing *Lacrosse *Tennis 33 international students were enrolled at The Gunston School for the opening of the 2017/2018 academic year.

It is a colonial coral with thin encrusting laminae. It is native to the central Indo-Pacific. Description Oxypora glabra is a species of scleractinia coral, otherwise known as stony or hard coral, and part of the family Lobophylliidae, which is characteristic of robust coral colonies.Arrigoni, Roberto, et al. ‚ÄúLobophylliidae (Cnidaria, Scleractinia) Reshuffled: Pervasive Non-Monophyly at Genus Level.‚Äù Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, vol. 73, 15 Jan. 2014, pp. 60‚Äì64. Corals are extremely plastic organisms in that their structures rely on their environment, making construction widely variable. O. glabra colonies are dark brown in color and have an encrusting laminae, or ‚Äúplate‚Äù, formation with twisted septa that form short, clockwise spiral structures .Nemenzo, F., 1959. Systematic studies on Philippine shallow water scleractinians. II Suborder Faviida. Nat. Appl. Sci. Bull. 16, 4, 73‚Äì135. The size of plating in O. glabra ranges between relatively small (<20 cm) to relatively large (>1m) throughout its depth distribution.Englebert, Norbert, et al. ‚ÄúLower Mesophotic Coral Communities (60-125 m Depth) of the Northern Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea.‚Äù PLOS ONE, vol. 12, no. 2, 2017. The distribution of costae, a rib-like structure, is numerous at the center of the coral colony and declines moving out toward the edges. The corallite diameter is small and not as widely spaced as other Oxypora species.Arrigoni, Roberto, et al. ‚ÄúSpecies Delimitation in the Reef Coral Genera Echinophyllia and Oxypora (Scleractinia, Lobophylliidae) with a Description of Two New Species.‚Äù Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, vol. 105, 31 Aug. 2016, pp. 146‚Äì159. Corals are often described by their morphological variation. This is problematic in the case of O. glabra because Lobophylliidae consists of 12 genera including Echinophyllia, which is often mistaken for species in the Oxypora genera.Arrigoni, Roberto, et al. ‚ÄúLobophylliidae (Cnidaria, Scleractinia) Reshuffled: Pervasive Non-Monophyly at Genus Level.‚Äù Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, vol. 73, 15 Jan. 2014, pp. 60‚Äì64. Because there is a history of insufficient descriptions of O. glabra, a molecular approach is needed to delaminate the scleractinia coral. In a 2016 study analyzing Indo-Pacific corals genotypes, shared haplotypes suggest O. glabra is more closely related to species in the Echinophyllia genera than those in Oxypora. Additional studies are needed in order to formally move O. glabra from the latter genus to the former.Arrigoni, Roberto, et al. ‚ÄúSpecies Delimitation in the Reef Coral Genera Echinophyllia and Oxypora (Scleractinia, Lobophylliidae) with a Description of Two New Species.‚Äù Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, vol. 105, 31 Aug. 2016, pp. 146‚Äì159. Distribution O. glabra is found throughout the Indo-Pacific and heavily concentrated in the mesophotic zone. The plating coral can be found as shallow as 3 meters,Hodgson, G. ‚ÄúTetracycline Reduces Sedimentation Damage to Corals.‚Äù Marine Biology, vol. 104, no. 3, 1990, pp. 493‚Äì496. but commonly dominates the lower mesophotic zone (60m-80m) due to its structure and large surface area that absorbs the limited light available at those depths. On a vertically structured reef, O. glabra is rarely found at depths below 90 meters, but on a gradually sloping reef it can be as deep as 110‚Äì125 m where there is more exposure to irradiance.Englebert, Norbert, et al. ‚ÄúLower Mesophotic Coral Communities (60-125 m Depth) of the Northern Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea.‚Äù PLOS ONE, vol. 12, no. 2, 2017. O. glabra is more common on the outer slope of Indo-Pacific reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, and is generally found in sheltered areas.Chevalier, J.P., 1975. Les scl√©ractiniaires de la m√©lan√©sie francaise (NouvelleCal√©donie, lies Chesterfield, lies Loyaut√©, Nouvelles-H√©brides). Exp√©dition Francaise Sur les R√©cifs Coralliens de la Nouvelle-Cal√©donie, Deuxieme Partie. Fond. Singer-Polignac, Paris. Reproduction Corals are made up of soft-bodied animals that form polyps. The multiplication of polyps through either intracellular or extracellular budding leads to the formations of coral colonies.Nemenzo, F., 1959. Systematic studies on Philippine shallow water scleractinians. II Suborder Faviida. Nat. Appl. Sci. Bull. 16, 4, 73‚Äì135. As an Indo-Pacific hermatypic, or reef building, coral, O. glabra is subject to a phenomenon known as mass spawning. As sea temperature rises during the spring, many coral species in the Great Barrier Reef synchronize the release of their gametes. The spawning occurs at night for several consecutive days and is the most common way in which scleractinian corals externally fertilize. The reason for this phenomenon is still widely unknown, but its importance is evident; whole populations of coral species engage in this action annually.Babcock, R. C., et al. ‚ÄúSynchronous Spawnings of 105 Scleractinian Coral Species on the Great Barrier Reef.‚Äù Marine Biology, vol. 90, no. 3, Feb. 1986, pp. 379‚Äì394. Threats Corals are susceptible to environmental and human impacts. When anthropogenic pollution causes ocean temperatures to rise, corals‚Äô symbiotic algae, called zooxanthellae, expel from the coral in a process commonly known as ‚Äúbleaching‚Äù that ultimately kills the organism. A 1990 studyHodgson, G. ‚ÄúTetracycline Reduces Sedimentation Damage to Corals.‚Äù Marine Biology, vol. 104, no. 3, 1990, pp. 493‚Äì496. conducted an experiment testing the effects of sedimentation of Indo-Pacific reef corals. Sediment deposits occur naturally, but can be expedited by humans through invasive processes such as dredging. O. glabra was found to be especially susceptible to sedimentation as sections of the coral layered with sediment underwent tissue necrosis that was ultimately fatal to the scleractinian coral. Exposing coral to the antibiotic tetracycline prevented some coral mortality, suggesting that the bacteria involved in tissue necrosis is tetracycline-sensitive.

It is a colonial coral which can be submassive, encrusting or laminar. It is native to the western Indo-Pacific. Description Colonies can adopt various forms, encrusting, plate-like or lumpy, sometimes varying in form in different parts of the same colony. On thin laminar plates, which may be a few millimetres thick, the corallites are delicate and about in diameter. Near the plate attachment the coral is thicker and the corallites are coarser. Septa-costae can be seen between the corallites, and the costae bear spines. The underside of the laminate plates are spiny and there are perforations in the plates. The colour of this coral is greyish-brown or grey, sometimes with a greenish tinge; the oral disc may have a complementary colour of red or green. Colonies seldom grow to a diameter of more than . This coral can be confused with Echinophyllia aspera underwater. Distribution and habitat O. lacera is native to the Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to Japan, the South China Sea, and eastern, northern and western Australia. It grows on protected reef slopes down to about , and to greater depths on outer reef slopes than on inner slopes. It is a common species, but is not conspicuous because of its drab colouring. Biology This coral is a hermaphrodite. Gametes are shed into the body cavity and pass through the mouths of the polyps into the sea. After fertilisation, the planula larvae are planktonic for a time. When sufficiently developed, they start developing tentacles, a pharynx and septa before settling on the sea bed and completing metamorphosis. Status Like other corals, the chief threats faced by this coral are from destruction of its reef habitat and the effects of global warming. However, it has a very wide range and is a common species, often found in deep water below , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

It took place on 8 November 1627. The English lost the battle, and this final failure forced them to withdraw back to England.  Before the battle  = English side = The English forces, having been defeated earlier that day at the siege of Saint-Martin, pulled back to the village of Loix, where their ships were anchored. Because of bad food, many soldiers in their army were sick. The army was commanded by George Villiers, the first duke of Buckingham, and was composed of 12 infantry regiments and 4 cannons, as well as several volunteer rochelais protestants, all covered by the cavalry, consisting of about 68 horses. Not having seen the French forces since their retreat from Saint-Martin, Buckingham's troops thought the French would not attack and, growing reckless, were neither walking in closed or open ranks. They arrived at the wooden bridge of the Feneau that they had built when they first landed on the island, that linked the island of Loix to the rest of l'√Æle de r√©. = French side = The French troops were commanded by the Mar√©chal Henri de Schomberg who, informed of the English retreat by Jean Caylar d'Anduze de Saint-Bonnet, had reassembled his army and begun pursuing the English. The French cavalry was commanded by Louis de Marillac.  The battle  The English vanguard marched towards Loix. Two English battalions, commanded by colonels Sir Edward Conway, Sir Peregrine Barty, Sir Henery Spry, had crossed the bridge. Another battalion, led by colonel Sir Charles Rich, the brother of the count of Holland Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland and half brother of Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport, Sir Alexander Brett and the lieutenant of Sir Thomas Morton (he being sick), were getting ready to cross the bridge with the four cannons. The two last battalions, that had not yet engaged themselves on the bridge, were commanded by colonel Sir William Courtney, lieutenant-colonel Sir Edward Hawley and Sir Ralph Bingley. The Mar√©chal de Schomberg, having crossed the village of La Couarde, was informed by Marillac of the English position. The English vanguard started to engage itself, slowly, because of the narrowness, on the bridge of Feneau. Judging the time to be right, the Mar√©chal ordered the cavalry captain Bussi-Lamet to charge the English rearguard with his squadron. He was followed closely by Marillac and Schomberg himself, leading the rest of the cavalry. The English cavaliers retaliated but were defeated. Many English were killed, including Sir William Cunningham, and others were captured, including Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport, colonel of the English cavalry, and half-brother of Sir Charles Rich and the count Holland, Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland. The English infantry intervened but also was defeated. Two regiments of the French infantry, the Pi√©mont regiment, commanded by Fran√ßois Duval de Fontenay- Mareuil, and the Champagne regiment commanded by Pierre Arnaud arrived in the melee. An important part of the English forces was violently pushed in the many muddy ditches in the area. The two English battalions before the bridge are defeated. A few rochelais protestants managed to cross the bridge. The French then started crossing the bridge, killing everyone in their way, notably Sir Charles Rich and Sir Alexander Brett, that try to defend it. There are two different versions of the outcome of the battle. = English version = After having crossed the bridge, the French forces, guided by Marillac, confronted Sir Thomas Fryar and Lieutenant-Colonel Hackluit commanding 40 pikes and 20 musketeers guarding the artillery and munitions. They were rapidly assisted by Sir Piers Crosby, commanding an Irish regiment. The French then panicked and withdrew to the bridge, disobeying the orders of Marillac. They then rallied and the count of Saligny, with a group of pikemen, charge again. They were, however, repelled and lost a commander. They charged a final time, were repelled again and withdraw from battle and cross the bridge back, chased by the English. While routing the French make Marillac fall from his horse. The English put an end to the chase and cross the bridge back to the island of Loix. The guarding of the bridge was given to Sir Piers Crosby. A few days later, when the sailing conditions became better, Crosby burned the bridge, and the surviving English forces embarked in their ships. = French version = \\"Combat et victoire obtenue sur les Anglois\\" (combat and victory obtained on the English) by Michel de la Mathoniere, 1627 Marillac dismounted from his horse and took over the command of the forces. After having crossed the bridge, the French forces captured the four small cannons of the English artillery. Few French soldiers fought on the front line, as a large part of the French forces took time capturing prisoners and the English arsenal. Marillac gave the order to move the arsenal a hundred feet back. The count of Saligny, then arrived with a few fresh men. He fought remarkably, and the English soldiers lifted up their pikes and marched towards him. He only had a dozen men left, including Feuquiere and Porcheux, captain of the gards regiment, that stood their ground and held the line. The men around Marillac pulled back in disorder, in spite of his orders, and even made him fall down. Saligny and his men, however, held on and contained the English, allowing the French soldiers to get refreshed and return to the melee. The fight lasted for two hours, after which the French triumphed over the English. The English army was in a mass rout. The causeway to Loix was covered in bodies, the ditches were full of men that are knocked unconscious in the mud. Some English soldiers swore they were Catholic, even showing rosaries and asking for mercy, but the French were ruthless. Many French noblemen were in the melee: the marquis of Annonay, Charles de L√©vis-Ventadour, who would later become duke of Ventadour; Antoine d'Aumont de Rochebaron, marquis of Villequier; the knight of Chappe and his brother; Jean of Estampes-Valen√ßay, baron of Valen√ßay; the count of Charraux or Ch√¢rost Louis of B√©thune, who will later become captain of the King's bodyguards; the count of Saligny, \\"a man of heart and of unique virtue\\"; Isaac of Rayni√©, Lord of Drouet; L'isle-Cerillac ; Manass√®s de Pas de Feuqui√®res; L'isle Montmartin ; Pierre Arnaud, mestre de camp of the regiment of Champagne; Alexandre of Garnier, Lord of the Garets; de Jonquieres; Jean- Louis the 1rst of Lou√´t of Calvisson; and Jacques of Castelnau of La Mauvissi√®re. Toiras himself fought, sword in hand. The English soldiers fled on every side, in the marshes, on the ditches' crossings, in the vineyards, constantly under fire from the French troops that chased them. Schonberg ordered the French troops pursuing the English to Loix to stop because they needed to rally and reorganize. Furthermore, night was falling. The retreat was signaled. The mar√©chal had the bridge guarded until he was certain that the English army had withdrawn from the island's soil.  Outcome of the battle  The air was fire and smoke, the land was covered in cadavers, and the water was reddened by the blood. The outcome of the battle was very costly for the English, counting about 1.800 dead; including 5 colonels; 3 lieutenant-colonels; 20 gentlemen, including Sir Henry Spry, Sir Charles Rich, Sir Alexander Brett, Sir Ralph Bingley, Sir William Cunningham, and 150 officers; and a thousand injured. 46 flags were captured. The captured included Milord Montjoye, cavalry commandant; the colonel Milord Grey (possibly Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford), grand master of the artillery; 35 captains or officers; 12 gentlemen; and between 100 and 120 soldiers. Every English horse, including Buckingham's, was captured, as well as the 4 cannons. Colonel Grey fell in a salt-pit during the battle, and shouted out to save his life, \\"A hundred thousand crowns for my ransom!\\". He was therefore captured and not killed. The Mar√©chal de Schonberg did not say a word about the French casualties, however, they were probably close to 500 or 600. The injured include the G√©n√©ral des Gal√®res, Pierre de Gondi, having received two pistol shots to the shoulder; the Marquis of Villequier having received a musket shot through his body (but \\"the injury was without danger\\"); De Iade, the captain of Schonberg's bodyguards and his squire took a pistol shot to the knee; Cussigny (Andr√©, lord of Cussigny and the barres ?), injured by a pike stab to the throat, and Porcheux having had his thigh torn. Toiras himself nearly got injured, taking two pistol shots that holed his hat.  Aftermath  Of the 46 flags, the first having been captured by Sieur de Belinghem helped by Sieur de Mo√ºy de la Mailleraye, all were sent to Paris by Claude de Saint-Simon and displayed on the vaults of Notre-Dame. \\"Messire de Schonberg apr√®s la victoire, pr√©sente les anglois captifs √† sa majest√©\\" (Messire de Schonberg after the victory, presents the English prisoners to his majesty), XVIIth century Toiras went back to the citadel of Saint-Martin, where the prisoners were also taken, to keep track of the anglo-rochelaise fleet. Some of the prisoners were ransomed. Schomberg returned to Saint-Martin as well to rest. He preferred not to leave the island until he was sure of the final departure of Buckingham. On the English side, about 2.000 survivors are on the ships including Benjamin de Rohan, lord of Soubise and younger brother of Henri II de Rohan, a French protestant. Buckingham, after having let his troops rest, leaves on 17 November to return to England after 3 months and 6 days of battle, promising to the rochelais protestants who had re-supplied his troops with fresh water twice to return with a bigger army. He would however not be able to stay true to his word, being assassinated by John Felton at the Greyhound Pub in Portsmouth on 23 August 1628, before the departure of the second expedition. Two centuries later, salt producers near the bridge of Feneau open a pit to bury the many bones, bullets and cannonballs scattered around on the ground.

It had a robust platform which was easily up-gradable with good performance even at an entry level. The success of the platform also lead to it being used for Kyosho's 1:8 scale monster truck the USA-1 Nitro Crusher. Kyosho designer and driver Yuichi Kanai started his involvement with the Turbo Burns and carried several parts and many design elements over to the classic Inferno series of cars which were produced from 1991 to 1996. The classic Inferno would later go on to win every IFMAR championship during its production run.  General History  = Background = Although Kyosho was already popular in the 1/8-scale off-road market with cars such as the Vanning, Landjump and Presto (from the Integra line-up), they were relatively complex vehicles made largely from metal, with limited upgrade and customization options. These original buggies took their design cues from real life vehicles which had a traditional ladder frame or cage construction and often had rear mounted engines. The Burns addressed this by taking advantage of new technologies and design elements.. * The introduction of more cheap yet durable and reliable injection molded parts, combined with metal elements where necessary for strength or adjust-ability * Aluminium pan chassis instead of a cage improving access for assembly and maintenance while maintaining rigidity. Also provided more flexibility for different motors, exhausts and electronics * Where applicable, shaft driven 4WD system with adjustable center differential instead of previous chain driven configurations * 4 wheel fully independent wishbone type suspension * Mid-mounted engine for better weight distribution and handling * Single radio tray which held all electrical components and could be switched as one unit when desired * Lexan bodies which were easy to produce, reduced weight, provided better protection for internal components, came in various designs to fit the same chassis, and allowed more creative freedom for paint and customization. * Released with 5 different factory specifications plus additional optional parts making it possible to start with the most affordable car and upgrade to a full option, competition ready vehicle when the skill and budget allowed. Alternatively one could buy a fully specced. car for less than the cost of the individual parts. With the exception of the large variety of standard models and the single radio tray, these designs can still be seen in the current Kyosho 1/8 scale buggies. The single radio tray was changed to a separate servo tray and water resistant battery and receiver box from the Inferno MP5 onward. It is often not realized that the \\"MP\\" nomenclature which is synonymous with Kyosho buggies from MP5 onward, was already in use at Kyosho for the Burns Series. Burns MP1, Turbo Burns MP2, Inferno MP3, Turbo Inferno MP4. = Timeline=  Burns MP 1 (1987-1992)  = Models & Specifications = As would be seen in future Kyosho releases, an intermediate level car was released first containing some performance parts. For both the Burns and classic Inferno series a more affordable \\"DX\\" version would be released only a year after the intermediate level vehicle. The differences between the Burns models were however more substantial than the later classic Inferno's. All of the cars were released in Kit form, with no pre-assembled parts. The cars popularity also spawned a larger number of 3rd party suppliers which provided additional performance accessories such as gears, brake discs, aluminum mounts and wishbones, stiffer chassis plates etc. One of the more popular suppliers was Duratrax.  Burns 4WD, item no. 3096 (1987-1988)  The Burns 4WD would eventually become the intermediate level car, with the later DX and Turbo variants made for the entry and competition markets respectively. Unlike the latter Inferno models this car was discontinued after the launch of these other variants which makes this car relatively rare. This car was revolutionary at the time for its use of the new design elements mentioned in the \\"Background\\" section above and differences between the final version of the car and the box art make it clear that this car was still being tweaked shortly before it came to market. These differences are discussed in a dedicated section below.  Burns DX 4WD item no. 3099 (1989-1991)  Parts which were not included or changed from the standard Burns 4WD were: * From black to orange o-rings in shocks (change) * No Bulkhead seals (omission) * From ball bearings to metal bushings (change) * From Universal swing shaft to dog bones in the front (change)  Burns DX 2WD item no. 3098 (1989-1992)  In addition to the changes of the Burns DX 4WD, the DX 2WD included additional changes to reduce the sales price: * All internals removed from center differential (omission) * No front center shaft (omission) * No front differential, front axles or bearings in the front differential housing (omission) * Front hubs which were specific to only this model (change) = Notable optional parts = The Burns series parts number started with BS for the standard parts, and BSW for the optional parts. It was possible to upgrade the entry level Burns DX 2WD to Turbo Burns specification by purchasing the required \\"BS\\" and \\"BSW\\" numbered parts. The options list of the original Burns manual is quite sparse as these parts were released over a period of several years and the manual was not updated to reflect what had become available. There are however few notable parts for the original Burns with most being available on eBay for reasonable prices. = Box art and marketing material = Unlike Tamiya and many other manufacturers which had drawn box art allowing for some artistic interpretation, Kyosho used studio pictures of the completed models. The only notable exceptions to this were the Kyosho Prestige, which was a rebranded car from HoBao, and the later Kyosho Turbo Inferno. The main picture on the front of the box showed the car from a forward, 45¬∞ angle. The sides of the box featured a top down and close-up shots without the lexan body, and a picture of the car being driven. The main box art for the DX 2WD was the same as for the DX 4WD, there was however a separate picture of the car with its own paint job used in marketing material, as well as a small image on the side of the standard Burns DX box. The paint jobs were simple yet effective with each of the three main models (Burns 2WD, 4WD and Turbo Burns), getting their own unique designs. Even today the paint jobs for the Burns 4WD and Turbo Burns are instantly recognized by most of the RC car community. Restorers typically try to emulate these to a certain extent which has also become easier in recent years due to 3rd party suppliers providing good quality reproduction bodies and decal sheets. The angular patterns and bold colors chosen for the box art matched the boxy lines of the car. The pictures on the Burns and Burns DX box-art were however most likely pre-production models as there are differences between the pictures and the final kit. * Various decals were not available on the final decal sheet (including the number \\"1\\" on the 4WD DX, or the large \\"KYOSHO\\" on the back of the 2WD DX). These however were decals which were available on other Kyosho models at the time. * The yellow fuel tank on the box art was white in the production model * The shiny wheels nuts were replaced with black oxidized versions, the same goes for the nylon nuts on the shock towers * Although included in the box, the rear torque rod and roll bar are not shown on the model. (Only applies to the Burns box not the Burns DX box) * The positions of front upper left suspension arm and the rear upper suspension arm were mixed up and therefore not assembled correctly. (Only applies to the Burns box not the Burns DX box) Fine red striping was done using Kyosho Micron Tape (can be seen if one has the original box). The Burns and Burns DX both featured O.S. Max .21 VF-B engines, the Turbo Burns had an O.S. Max EX-B engine. O.S. engines would also feature prominently on the box art for later cars. Towards the end of the DX production run the marketing material also showed a simplified paint job for the Burns DX which featured clear windows with painted safety nets and an O.S. EX-B engine instead of an O.S. VF-B engine. = Pricing = Although it was still not cheap the Burns had mass appeal and brought the hobby within the reach of many younger hobbyist. At the time, a stock Burns DX 4WD with basic OS RF-B engine would cost around US$580 in the Tower Hobbies catalog, or US$710 Dollars with the competitive OS EX-B engine. = Collectabillity and current popularity (1992-) = Today, the original Burns (MP1) is a sought-after collectors item when in good condition with its original box and documentation. The most valuable of these, due to its rarity is the original Burns produced from 1987 to 1988. The original Burns is however sought more by enthusiasts who have a special connection to that particular car, with most collectors and drivers purchasing the top of the line Turbo Burns which was out of reach for most hobbyist in the late 80s. There is a large community with several forums providing detailed information and restoration threads (see external reference list below). Nostalgic hobbyist and parents that grew up in the 1980s also restore these so they can be enjoyed with their own children. Although special option parts are relatively rare and expensive, regular spares and parts cars are available in abundance on sites such as eBay and craigslist making the Burns a very affordable and rugged entry level vehicle even today. In lieu of noise restrictions and the advances of battery and brushless technology, some cars are also being converted to an electric powertrain. This does require some modifications to the car, so good condition versions are typically left in stock condition for authenticity and value.  Turbo Burns MP 2 (1989-1991)  = Models & Specifications = The Turbo Burns saw the first involvement of Yuichi Kanai who would later go on to develop the Inferno series of cars which won 8 world championships from 1991 until 2010. As with many products in the 1980s and early 1990s the \\"Turbo\\" nomenclature was used to indicate that it was high-end model. Yuichi Kanai would also use the \\"Turbo\\" nomenclature for the later Inferno series. Although it looked very different due to its new body shell, the \\"T. Burns\\" was only an evolution compared to its predecessor. It implemented small changes based on the lessons learned from the 2 years of competing with the original Burns, as well as introducing a large number of optional parts to fine tune the performance of the vehicle. The Turbo Burns was replaced with the classic Inferno 4WD in 1991, while the cheaper Burns DX 4WD was still on sale until the release of the Inferno DX in 1992.  Turbo Burns item no. 3097 (1989-1991)  The standard Turbo Burns was a competition level buggy which provided not only the full specification of the original Burns 4WD but also the following changes and improvements. * Longer wheelbase. Although the chassis plate in Burns and Turbo Burns are of the same length, the longer wheelbase in the Turbo Burns was achieved by moving the rear gear box further to the back. *Counter sunk screws in the chassis * Adjustable center differential * Longer wishbones at front * Rear hub carriers with more setup options * Larger capacity shock absorbers front and rear * Newly designed, stronger shock stays/towers with more setup possibilities * Rear anti-roll bar (stabilizer/sway bar) * Fuel tank with spring loaded cap for faster refueling * Newly designed tuned muffler and manifold * New lexan body * New 5 spoke wheels  Turbo Burns Special Champion Car \\"SCC\\" / \\"S.C.C.\\" (1990 after World Championship - 1991)  The SCC was released towards the end of the Turbo Burns production after the IFMAR championships. Compared to the later post championship releases of the Inferno series, this car came with very few of the optional parts which were available at the time. There were however several changes to the car which would become standard design elements for the Inferno cars starting in 1991 until today. The SCC appears to have been a limited release for certain countries and dealers, it was not an official kit and is not mentioned in any catalogs. It had the same model number as the regular Turbo Burns and did not have any additional markings on the box or in the instructions to indicate that special optional parts were included. The special parts consisted of: * BS-58 Rear wheel (additional set for the front of the car) *BSW-28 Long shock absorbers (an additional set to be mounted to the front of the car) *BSW-38 Rear carbon shock tower *BSW-40 Multi-pin Tire (for front and rear, until this point all 1/8 scale Kyosho buggies had thinner tires at the front) *BSW-43 Front brake system. * BSW-50 Front carbon shock tower (made specifically to implement the longer rear shocks at the front) * BSW-58 Flywheel nut The SCC showed a glimpse of what the future Kyosho Inferno would become, the platform being a proving ground for parts which were to be carried over into the next generation of car. It is interesting to see which elements Yuichi Kanai took as is, and which were further developed or dropped all together for the Kyosho Inferno. Although the wheels were redesigned and replaced with part BSW-80, the concept of having wide wheels at the front remained with all 1:8 scale Kyosho Buggies from this point forward. The BSW-40 tires were standard until the Kyosho MP5 was released in 1995. The concept of having independently adjustable rear and front brake discs was also carried over to the Kyosho Inferno. The disc and caliper parts used for the front brake on the SCC were used as standard for both front and rear brakes on the Kyosho Inferno until the Inferno MP 7.5 a decade later. On the SCC the font brake was mounted to the front gearbox and operated through the centrally located servo used for the throttle and \\"rear\\" brake. The long, thin metal rod which connected the servor to the front bake had a tendency to flex, reducing the precision of the brakes and making adjustments more difficult. In addition the aluminum plate/brace mounted above the brake had to be removed to adjust the calipers. The braking system was redesigned for the Inferno so that both discs were attached to either end of center differential, thereby eliminating these issues. It is a principle design element which has not changed since. The BSW-38 rear shock tower was made available as an optional part for all infernos up until the Kyosho MP5 for which the shock tower was completely redesigned. The concept of having tall shock towers using the same springs and dampers as the rear of the car (parts BSW-50 and BSW-28), had not been implemented on any previous Kyosho 1:8 buggies and was abandoned after this single implementation. The classic Inferno reverted to the same springs and shock absorber setup as the standard Turbo Burns, with the concept of having a shorter suspension setup at the front remaining until the point of writing. = Notable optional parts = As there are relatively minor differences between the Burns models, and as the cars were designed to be up-gradable from the beginning, the optional parts mentioned above could be used on any of the cars. There were also a few parts from other cars released at around the same time which were also compatible. This includes the \\"Brake Set\\" of the Fantom 20 track car (part FM-179), or the \\"Special Disc Brake Rotor\\" (part 39306) from the GP10 SuperTen on-road cars. One of the last optional parts produced for the Burns was the rare BSW-50 which was made for the Turbo Burns SCC. Initially the \\"classic\\" Inferno also used the BSW part numbers of which some could also be used for the Burns. These were: * BSW-51 Special Engine Mount *BSW-71 Rear Spoiler (in various colors) *BSW-80 Wheels (in various colors) * BSW-82 Front One Way Diff In addition a useful upgrade is the classic Inferno's standard differential which had 4 spider gears instead of 2 Although Kyosho did offer a similar sized, high performance disc brake for its GP10 SuperTen range of cars (part 39306), an additional, common 3rd party upgrade was a resin disc brake made by Duratrax as the standard Kyosho disc made from plastic, had a tendency to melt under heavy, repeated loads. This is also an issue Kyosho recognized, and was most likely more apparent, on the heavier, Burns based USA-1monster truck. From the USA-1 onwards kyosho provided replaceable brake liners which could be stuck on either side of the disc. This brake liner was made available in the regular replacement brake set after this point (part BS-20) and could then be retro-fitted to the Burns models. The optional and smaller front brake set for the Turbo Burns (BSW-43), which became the standard rotor and pad used on the later Inferno, was supplied with brake liners from the start. There were also a couple of suppliers which made optional parts in limited numbers. These parts were mostly machined aluminum parts which replace weaker plastic parts on the orgiginal Burns model, including the plastic mounts for the center differential. Kyosho recognized this weakness and redesigned the plastic mounts, and re-inforced them with an aluminum brace plate from the classic Inferno onwards. In Germany this included Jamara, and H√∂tschick Tuning (later is no longer in business), which were both typically anodized in a purple color, and Crono Racing in France . The German hobby store Conzelmann Tuning made blue anodized parts including a one piece aluminum radio plate which held both the steering and throttle servos. The plate was mounted to two, blue anodized, solid aluminum center differential mounts. These hobby stores also competed in races with their own cars to test and showcase their products. Crono Racing raced the Koysho Burns successfully in France in the 80's , and still has a shop in Paris, France. = Box art and marketing material = The new rounded body received more flowing lines and calmer blue coloring with a color matching O.S. Max .21 EX-B engine. There are two minor difference between the box model and the final model: * The image on the side of the box which shows the underside of the car with the optional BSW7 chassis plate with holes drilled further back to position the rear gear box towards the rear and therefore achieving a longer wheelbase. In the picture there are 8 holes in the chassis for the rear gear box with the original 4 being covered up. It is believed that the final production chassis was not ready when the box photo was taken. * The body on the box art is missing the \\"bubble\\" on the left side which was required to ensure free movement of the linkage on the throttle servo. This space was added on the final production body. The success of the Turbo Burns body shape was apparent in the design of the shells for the Kyosho Inferno cars right up until the Inferno MP9 nearly 20 years later. = Pricing = A Turbo Burns with OS EX-B engine could cost nearly US$900 at the time which put it out of reach of most RC enthusiast and has added to the desirability of the car today. Adjusted for inflation in 2019, this would be approximately $1800 Dollars. To put this into perspective, the current Kyosho MP10 with a competition engine retails for $860. = Collectabillity and current popularity (1992-) = Due to its high sales price at the time the Turbo Burns ist highly sought after not only by collectors but also by adults who could not afford this car during their childhood. The most valuable are typically mint condition Turbo Burns with the paint job and OS EX-B engine which were shown on the box art. A mint condition, regular Turbo Burns will generally exceed US$500 with this configuration. Mint condition SCC variants are typically valued even higher. As with the Burns (MP1), there are many forums and threads dedicated to this car. The value of the Turbo Burns in relation to the original can often be seen in the level of dedication invested by their owners, with some cars being restored to what can be described as \\"concourse condition\\". As with the original Burns and Burns DX, these cars are also being converted to brushless technology.

She supported women's rights, temperance, education, and Unitarian organizations. Lowe was born in New Hampshire in 1829, and died in Massachusetts in 1902. Her parents were General Justus Perry and Hannah Wood. She was a descendant of William Wood, the supposed author of New England's Prospects, who left England and settled in Concord in 1638. At the age of 15, she was sent to Sedgwick's 'School for Young Ladies'. After her graduation, she spent a winter in the West Indies, and the following year was passed in Madrid with her brother, who was a member of the Spanish legation. In 1857, she married the Rev. Charles Lowe who died in 1874, and at the time of his death was a member of the Somerville school committee. In 1871, when the family went to Europe, Lowe corresponded regularly for the Liberal Christian. In Somerville, she was connected with the Unitarian Review. She was the author of several books of prose and poetry; the most noted ones include The Olive and the Pine, Love in Spain, and a Memoir of Charles Lowe. She was interested in many public and private philanthropies, but her chief interests were in the public schools. She was among the first to advocate the teaching of cooking and sewing, and at her suggestion a sum of money was raised for that purpose. She was one of the founders of the Educational Union in Somerville, one of whose duties was a regular visitation of the schools by its members. She was a member of the Society of American Authors of New York, the Authors' Club of Boston, the Woman's Education Association, and the Unitarian Church Temperance Society, as well as an honorary member of the Castilian Club, of the Heptorean Club, of the Teachers' Annuity Guild, honorary president of the Woman Suffrage League, a director of the Massachusetts Suffrage Association, president of the Woman's Alliance of the First Unitarian Church, and a member of the Cambridge Branch of the Indian Association. Early years and education Martha Ann Perry was born in Keene, New Hampshire, November 21, 1829. Her parents were Gen. Justus Perry and Hannah Wood. As a child, Lowe was rather heedless, enjoying more her life out of doors than plays or studies in the house. She loved her garden, the animals about the farm, and all out-of-door games and amusements. Between the ages of 12 and 14, she lost her father and mother, an older sister, and a younger brother who had been her constant companion. Thereafter, Lowe, her sister Ellen, and her brother Horatio continued to live in the family with an aunt and cousin. Perry attended the district school and the Keene Academy. At the age of 12, she and Martha were old enough to have a more advanced education, and they were sent to Elizabeth Sedgwick's 'School for Young Ladies' in Lenox, Massachusetts. The influence of this school was to them both a lasting benefit. On the return of the two sisters from Lenox, their pastor Rev. Abiel Abbott Livermore and his wife were invited to make the Perry family mansion their home. Lowe occupied her leisure with riding, driving, and singing. After a year at home, she went to Boston, to take piano lessons. Her first winter was spent with the family of Mrs. George Bond, one of the ladies of Boston society. Her second winter in Boston was devoted to lessons in singing, and she stayed in the home of Dr. and Mrs. Henry I. Bowditch. In the meantime, the elder brother, Horatio, after graduating from Harvard College, had enlisted in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and served as aide-de-camp on the staff of General Shields. On his return from the war, he went with his sisters and the Livermores to the West Indies, where they spent a winter. When the party returned, Horatio received through President Zachary Taylor an appointment as Secretary of Legation to Spain. He accepted the position, and not long after married Carolina Coronado, poet-laureate of Spain. Horatio Perry continued to live abroad, and became distinguished in Spain. Lowe and her sister visited them, and while there, studied French, learned to speak Spanish, and attended many court balls and receptions, under the reign of Queen Isabella II. During that winter in Madrid, they also met many persons of distinction. They afterward traveled on the Continent and in England, returning finally to their old home in Keene. Career =Marriage and early writing= The Olive and the Pine After her year abroad, Lowe resolved to put into form a poetic souvenir of her travels. During this time, her sister Ellen married Dr. Edward B. Peirson of Salem, Massachusetts. While Lowe was visiting in this new home, she met the Rev. Charles Lowe, pastor of the North Church of that city. They were married in the autumn of 1857. After a trip in the Berkshires, they settled on the Pickman farm, which belonged to Dr. and Mrs. George B. Loring, and was situated about from Salem. Mr. Lowe at this time was obliged, on account of ill health, to resign his pastorate at the North Church. Their stay on the farm was of short duration, but they were able to secure a nearby cottage close to the water, which they called \\"Mill-side\\", where Mrs. Lowe completed her first book, The Olive and the Pine, or Spain and New England. The first part is devoted to Spain, and the latter to New England. Love in Spain, and Other Poems Mr. Lowe soon regained health and strength, after a year of rest and change, and accepted a call to the parish of the First Congregational Society in Somerville. In this city, the Lowes established their first home, building a pleasant house on one of the hills commanding a view of Cambridge and Boston; and here their two daughters, Mary Foote and Jeanie Wood, were born. Mrs. Lowe entered into church work; and she also, at the time of the American Civil War, published a second book, called Love in Spain, a dramatic poem. The book also contained poems on the Civil War and on miscellaneous subjects. Mr. Lowe twice went South during the war as chaplain. He was chairman of the army committee of the Association, and gave his time and strength to the Freedmen's Aid Society and to the Sanitary Commission. On his return, failing health once more forced him to relinquish his charge at Somerville. He then became secretary of the American Unitarian Association, where his services were valuable during one of the critical periods in the history of the denomination. His ill health compelled him to retire from the secretaryship in 1871. Now that this work was finished, the Lowes, with their daughters, went abroad for nearly two years; spending their winters, on account of Mr. Lowe's health, in southern France, Italy, and Spain; returning to Switzerland and England during the summer months. On their return to Boston, Mr. Lowe started a religious magazine, The Unitarian Review, in the interest of his denomination, in which work Mrs. Lowe assisted him. Mr. Lowe's health declined rapidly during the winter and spring, and it seemed advisable to try the benefit of sea air for the invalid. In the month of June, he went with his family to Swampscott, Massachusetts, where, after an illness of two weeks, he died on June 20, 1874. =Widowhood and later works= After the death of her husband, Lowe prepared the Memoir of Charles Lowe, which was published in 1884, a book not only full of interesting incidents of her husband's life, but containing a vivid history of the liberal church of that period. She continued to live in the home in Somerville, devoting herself to the care and education of her daughters. As the years went by, she took a more active part in the work of her church, and in the different organizations to which she belonged in Somerville and Boston. She also continued to werite, contributing notes on \\"Things at Home and Abroad\\" in The Unitarian Review, \\"Gleanings of Foreign Thought\\" for the Transcript, writing summer sketches for the Woman's Journal, also many poems for different occasions, and memorial verses for the dead. Bessie Gray ; And, Our Stepmother The Story of Chief Joseph was published in 1881, a metrical version of the eloquent speech of Chief Joseph, in order to awaken sympathy for the Native American cause. Bessie Grey was a small illustrated gift-book. Her last work was a volume of poems, many of which had been printed before, but rearranged and published in 1900, an Easter memorial tribute called The Immortals. She contributed often to the journals in her own town, and constantly contributed to newspapers and periodicals. Lowe was frequently invited to read poems on public occasions. Activism =Schools, clubs, and church= left Lowe was one of the earliest members of the New England Women's Club, which she attended regularly for many years, often joining in the discussion at its meetings, or reading a poem at the club teas. She was a member of the Society of American Authors of New York, an honorary member of the Castilian Club of Boston, a member of the Women's Education Association of Boston, of the Authors' Club, the Educational and Industrial Union, and the Unitarian Church Temperance Society. She was a life member of the American Unitarian Association, and at one time the only woman on its board of directors. She was also a member of the Cambridge Branch of the Massachusetts Indian Association, and a director of the Massachusetts Suffrage Association. In Somerville, she was a member of the Associated Charities, the Historical Society, honorary member of the Heptorean Club, honorary member of the Teachers' Annuity Guild, honorary president of the Suffrage League, and president of the Women's Alliance. She was interested in many private and public philanthropies, advocating the cause of Native Americans and Afro-Americans, and giving her sympathies to all in need, from blind children in South Boston to the famine sufferers in the East. left Lowe, with the aid of Mrs. Maria Theresa Hollander, formed the Woman's Educational Union in Somerville, in about 1878. This was one of the first organizations of women in the city. Its meetings were held once a month, for a number of years, and speakers from Boston and its vicinity were brought before these parlor audiences. Lowe continued to be the president of this society as long as it existed. During a period of distress in the city of Somerville, Lowe established a bureau to give work to poor women. In this undertaking, ladies met every week during the winter months for a number of years, and the society existed until the need of it was greatly lessened by the formation of the Somerville Associated Charities. Lowe enjoyed the work of her church, having among other duties taught a class of young women in the Sunday School for many years. At the time of the forming of the Women's National Alliance, the union that Lowe started became a branch, and with the assistance of many women in the parish, it grew to be a large and important organization. Lowe was president of this Alliance during its whole history. =Suffrage and temperance= Lowe always had an interest and active part in the cause of women's suffrage and the temperance movement. The Suffrage League grew out of the Educational Union, and Lowe was for some time its president, later becoming an honorary president. In 1881, as an ardent suffragist, at the time when Massachusetts first gave women the opportunity to vote on school affairs, she and others worked unceasingly to help the women of the city to avail themselves of this privilege; and it is largely through her labors that women were at last placed upon the School Board of Somerville. She was most earnest also in promoting the cause of temperance, speaking often in its behalf before the Alliance in her own church. She felt deeply the general lack of interest which was shown in her denomination. Lowe was not a total abstainer, believing the use of alcohol in sickness often a necessity, but she admonished its use in daily life. She had great respect for the work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Personal life During the last year of her life, her health, always delicate, became more frail, but she kept up her interest in all the former work of her life, in spite of times of discouragement, for she realized that her strength was gradually becoming less. She presided at several Alliance meetings, although her friends well-knew that she was not able to bear the strain; but even in times of great weariness she would have days of enjoyment. Not many months before, on a visit to Concord, Massachusetts, which always brought happiness to her, she took part in the music one evening, and sang to the young people about her. One of the happiest recollections, to those nearest her, was of the last Christmas family gathering, in her own home, when she joined in the simple games and dances with her grandchildren. The two married daughters resided near their mother in Somerville, Massachusetts. Death and legacy Martha Perry Lowe School in Somerville, Massachusetts In Memoriam Martha Perry Lowe, 1829-1902 In April 1902, Lowe developed pneumonia, from which, although not of a very serious nature, she did not have the strength to rally. She died on May 6, 1902. In Memoriam Martha Perry Lowe, 1829-1902 was published in 1903. In the same year, in recognition of her interest and efforts in behalf of the public schools, the School Committee voted to name the new building in West Somerville the Martha Perry Lowe School.

It coordinated the coast defenses of New York City from 1895 to 1950, beginning with the Endicott program, some of which were located in New Jersey. These included both coast artillery forts and underwater minefields. The command originated circa 1895 as an Artillery District(s) and became the Coast Defenses of Eastern New York and Coast Defenses of Southern New York in 1913. Circa 1915 the Coast Defenses of Sandy Hook separated from the latter command. In 1925 the commands were renamed as Harbor Defense Commands, and in 1935 the Harbor Defenses of Eastern New York was almost entirely disarmed, although possibly retaining the minefield capability. The New York and Sandy Hook commands and the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound were unified as the Harbor Defenses of New York on 9 May 1942.Stanton, pp. 455-481Coast Artillery Organization: A Brief Overview at the Coast Defense Study Group websiteRinaldi, pp. 165-166Berhow, pp. 427-434 History =Early forts in New York City= Colonial period Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian working for France, is credited with being the first European to explore the New York City area, in 1524. He was closely followed the next year by a Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese explorer Est√™v√£o Gomes. In 1542 the French established a fortified trading post known as Fort d'Anorm√©e Berge (Fort of the Grand Scarp), in southern Manhattan on an island in a lake later called Collect Pond. It is unclear when it was disestablished.Early New York City forts at American Forts Network Dutch settlement of the area began with an expedition in 1609 by Henry Hudson, an Englishman working for the Dutch East India Company, for whom the Hudson River (called the North River in the Dutch period) and other places are named. Other Dutch-sponsored explorers soon followed him, with a blockhouse/trading post in Manhattan by 1612.Fort Amsterdam at American Forts Network In 1614 Fort Nassau, a factorij or fortified trading post, was established at what is now Albany, New York. This was the first permanent Dutch settlement in the area, by the New Netherland Company as part of the colony of the same name. This colony was established primarily to exploit the North American fur trade, and grew over the next forty years with fortified settlements from the South River (Delaware River) to what is now Rhode Island.Laws and Ordinances of New Netherland 1638-1674, compiled and translated by E.B. Callaghan, 1868 Map of New Amsterdam showing Fort Amsterdam and the wall, published 1660 (north is to the right). In 1621 the Dutch West India Company took over management of New Netherland and other Dutch possessions in the New World. In 1624, after floods showed that Fort Nassau was untenable, it was replaced with Fort Orange. Also in that year, Dutch settlement of what became New York City began with a colony on Noten Eylandt (Nut or Nutten Island, now Governors Island). The next year the colony moved to Manhattoes (now southern Manhattan) to establish New Amsterdam, which has been settled ever since, and built Fort Amsterdam to protect themselves. In 1653 the wall at what is now Wall Street was added for protection from potential English attack. In 1655 Peter Stuyvesant led an expedition that subjugated the New Sweden colony along the Delaware River, and in that same year a raid by Indian allies of the Swedes in the \\"Peach Tree War\\" caused significant damage and loss of life in New Amsterdam and the surrounding area. In 1664 an English expedition arrived in what is now New York Harbor and demanded the colony's surrender. Stuyvesant felt the colony could not defend itself, regretting that his prior requests for troops and defensive resources from the Dutch West India Company had not been met, and on 8 September he surrendered New Netherland to the English. The English renamed the city \\"New York\\" at this time and established the Province of New York from the former New Netherland, also establishing the Province of New Jersey the next year. The colony was named for its nominal ruler, James, Duke of York, who later became King James II of England. Fort Amsterdam was renamed Fort James in his honor. Lingering resentment over the takeover was a cause of the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665. This ended with the Treaty of Breda in 1667, which made the English takeover official. In 1673, during the Third Anglo- Dutch War, the Dutch seized New York from the English, but the English regained the colony the following year via the Treaty of Westminster that ended that war.Hainsworth and Churches, pp. 95-110 The Signal Hill site on Staten Island at The Narrows, eventually known as Fort Wadsworth, was first fortified with a blockhouse by Dutch settler David Pieterszen de Vries in 1636. This blockhouse was destroyed in the Peach Tree War of 1655.Fort Wadsworth at American Forts Network The site is said to have been \\"continuously garrisoned\\" since another blockhouse was built in 1663 until the fort's closure in 1994, making it the oldest such site in the Thirteen Colonies until that time. The 1663 blockhouse survived at least through 1808; sources state that it was enclosed intact by the first Fort Tompkins at that time.Roberts, pp. 587-589 James II proved to be deeply unpopular in England, and he was deposed in the \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688, being replaced by William and Mary. Some of James' colonial governors were not immediately replaced, and some of these were unpopular in the colonies they governed. Shortly before James' overthrow New England, New York, and New Jersey were combined as the Dominion of New England, with Edmund Andros as governor in Boston and Francis Nicholson as lieutenant governor in New York. In 1689 many of the locally recruited militia in both cities revolted as the Boston Revolt in April and Leisler's Rebellion at the end of May. Both Andros and Nicholson were imprisoned, and the New England colonies re-established their governments. In Boston the rebellion was soon over, but in New York Jacob Leisler acted as de facto governor of the province for nearly two years. The French took advantage of the situation by raiding Schenectady with their Indian allies in February 1690, causing Leisler to divert most of his resources to an unsuccessful retaliatory expedition against New France. On 19 March 1691 the newly appointed royal governor Henry Sloughter arrived in New York and imprisoned Leisler and several of the rebellion's leaders. Leisler and one other were executed on 16 May.Van Rensselaer, pp. 472-489 The fort in Manhattan went through several name changes from 1685 through 1714, finally becoming Fort George. In 1699 the wall that Wall Street is named for was dismantled. New York City was a base for British operations in the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War) from 1754 to 1763. That conflict united the colonies for the first time in common defense, and ended by eliminating the French military threat that the colonists had relied upon Britain to defend them from.Fowler, pp. 134-139 In 1765 the British Parliament imposed a Stamp Act to augment local expenditures for defending the colonies. One result was that delegates from nine colonies met to protest at what would later be known as Federal Hall in Manhattan as the Stamp Act Congress, protesting \\"taxation without representation\\". In November of that year a committee of the Sons of Liberty was established in New York.Miller 1943, pp. 65-74 Revolutionary War In April 1775 the American Revolution broke out full-scale at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. In March 1776 Patriot forces captured Boston. Their commander, General George Washington, thought the evacuating British force would immediately attempt to capture New York and sent troops to the city, soon followed by himself. Several forts were built by the patriots in the New York City area in June and July 1776, including Fort WashingtonNYC park website on Fort Washington in northwestern Manhattan and Fort Constitution (later Fort Lee) across the Hudson in the town later named for it.Fort Lee Historic Park at Palisades park website Both forts were just south of the current George Washington Bridge. Fort Lee was named for Patriot general Charles Lee. A chevaux de frise barrier was placed in the Hudson between the two forts to prevent ships passing. Both forts were hastily built and had few defensive features, even lacking ditches. Another fort that proved important was a set of batteries on Nutten Island. Numerous small forts were also built in the city.Roberts, pp. 596-605 On 3 July 1776 the British landed unopposed on Staten Island and soon captured Flagstaff Fort on Signal Hill, later the site of Fort Wadsworth. The British forces were under General Sir William Howe. They included troops evacuated from Boston along with reinforcements, some of which were Hessian troops from Germany. On 4 July 1776 a small American battery called the Narrows Fort,NYC Revolutionary forts at American Forts Network on the site of the later Fort Hamilton (the Brooklyn side of the Narrows), fired into one of the British men-of-war convoying the British invasion force. HMS Asia suffered damage and casualties, but opposition to the immense fleet could be little more than symbolic. However, the Nutten Island batteries engaged and on 12 July 1776; this may have made the British cautious about entering the East River.Smith 1913, p. 49 In late August the British landed in Brooklyn and on 27 August the Battle of Long Island was fought, the largest battle of the Revolution in total number of troops engaged. Washington's forces were thrown back to their fortifications on Brooklyn Heights, and soon made a withdrawal under cover of night and fog across the East River to Manhattan, unimpeded by the Royal Navy.McCullough, p. 191 On 6 September the submarine Turtle made the first recorded submarine attack in history in New York Harbor. This one-man hand-powered submarine had been built the previous year by David Bushnell, an inventor from Connecticut. Turtle was crewed by Sergeant Ezra Lee, also from Connecticut. Lee reported that he attempted to attack HMS Eagle, flagship of Admiral Sir Richard Howe, brother of the general. Turtle was equipped to attach a mine (called a \\"torpedo\\" in those days) to a ship by means of a spike or possibly an auger. Lee reported that he was unable to attach the mine to the ship, and surfaced and retreated. He also stated that British boats approached him from Governors Island, so he released the mine, which exploded.Schecter, p. 174 On 5 October another attempt was made, but Lee withdrew when the target's crew spotted him. Later that month the British captured Turtle and scuttled her near Fort Lee, New Jersey, although Bushnell may have salvaged her later. Her final fate is unknown. During the Long Island battle the British had captured General John Sullivan. Admiral Howe convinced him to deliver a message to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, and released him on parole. Washington also gave his permission, and on 2 September Sullivan told the Congress that the Howes wanted to negotiate, and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held. This created a diplomatic problem for Congress, which did not want to be seen as aggressive. Consequently, Congress agreed to send a committee to meet with the Howes in a move they did not think would bear any fruit. On 11 September, the Howe brothers met with John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Rutledge in the Staten Island Peace Conference. The Americans insisted on retaining independence as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, and the Howes said they had no authority to allow that, and specifically regarded the patriot delegates as British subjects. So the war continued.Ketchum (1973), pp. 116-117 On 15 September the British landed in southern Manhattan and quickly took the city, which only extended to the southern part of the island at the time. Washington felt the city could not be defended, and held out on the high ground around Fort Washington now known as Washington Heights, successfully repulsing a British attack the next day in the Battle of Harlem Heights.McCullough, p. 218 After a standoff of nearly a month, the British attempted to outflank Washington by landing in southeastern Westchester County, initially thwarted at Throgs Neck on 12 October, but overcoming opposition at Pelham on 18 October.Abbatt, p. 5 Washington moved the bulk of his forces northward, fighting the Battle of White Plains on 28 October. Although the Patriots were pushed back in that battle, Howe waited four days for reinforcements before following them, and the Patriots were able to retreat to high ground. Howe and Henry Clinton, one of his principal subordinates, had been in command at the costly British victory in the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, and a desire to avoid heavy casualties in assaults on fortified positions seems to have colored their actions through the rest of the war.Jackson and Dunbar, p. 20 In mid-November Howe returned to Manhattan, capturing Fort Washington and taking 3,000 prisoners, and within a few days also capturing Fort Lee. Washington retreated to northern New Jersey. In early December Howe detached a force under Cornwallis to pursue Washington (who retreated to Pennsylvania),Schechter, pp. 259-263 and sent a naval force carrying 6,000 troops under Clinton to seize and occupy Newport, Rhode Island, where they remained for nearly three years.Duchesneau and Troost-Cramer, pp. 16-19 In early 1777 the British planned to cut New England off from the rest of the colonies by sending a force under John Burgoyne southward from Montreal through the Lake Champlain area and the Hudson Valley to Albany. This was intended to be supported by a force under Howe advancing northward from New York City. However, George Germain, a British civilian official managing the war in London, also gave approval for Howe to capture Philadelphia.Jeremy Black, War for America: The Fight for Independence, 1775‚Äì1783 (1998) pp. 117‚Äì21 Howe proceeded with the Philadelphia plan and failed to support Burgoyne's campaign. The Philadelphia campaign was time-consuming but successful; the British took a lengthy water route through Chesapeake Bay, marched overland to defeat Washington at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September, and entered Philadelphia unopposed on 26 September.Higginbotham, pp. 181-188 However, by that time the initial success of Burgoyne's campaign had come to a defeat in the first of the Battles of Saratoga, at Freeman's Farm on 19 September.Ketchum 1997, pp. 360-368 Shortly after this, Henry Clinton, having returned from the Rhode Island expedition, moved north from New York City and on 6 October successfully attacked Forts Clinton and Montgomery, just north of Bear Mountain on the Hudson. Clinton's expedition also raided as far north as Kingston. However, all three dispatch riders sent to inform Burgoyne of their success were captured, so Burgoyne was unaware of this.Nickerson, pp. 348-351 Following defeat at Bemis Heights on 7 October and a subsequent siege, Burgoyne surrendered his army on 17 October. This victory persuaded France to enter the war on the Patriot side. Word of it reached Commissioner Benjamin Franklin in Paris on 4 December, and negotiations resulted in France declaring war on Britain in March 1778. Howe resigned his command and Henry Clinton took charge of the British force in Philadelphia. Due to the French naval threat, Clinton was ordered to abandon Philadelphia and bring his army to New York City. The British left Philadelphia on 18 June. Washington's army shadowed Clinton's, and Washington successfully forced a battle at Monmouth Courthouse on 28 June, the last major battle in the North. By July, Clinton was in New York City, and Washington was again at White Plains, New York. Both armies were back where they had been two years earlier. The military focus of the war shifted to the southern colonies. Eventually, the American victory in the Yorktown campaign on 19 October 1781 proved to be the key to independence; the British received word of it on 25 November. This precipitated a collapse of Lord North's Tory government in March 1782. The new Whig government suspended offensive operations in the Thirteen Colonies and commenced lengthy peace negotiations, culminating in the Treaty of Paris that ended the war on 3 September 1783.Paterson, Vol. 1, p. 20 On 25 November the British forces departed New York City; this is remembered as Evacuation Day.Riker, pp. 16-18 1783-War of 1812 Unlike most other harbors, post-independence fort-building in New York was begun by the state rather than the federal government. The former Fort Amsterdam was demolished in 1790. The series of forts completed nationwide circa 1794 to 1800 later became known as the first system of US seacoast fortifications. In New York this was initially limited to the large Fort Jay on Governors Island, along with some small batteries on Oyster Island (later Ellis Island) and Bedloe's Island (later Liberty Island). These were simple earthworks at the time. Congress contributed to building Fort Jay in 1797, and in 1800 the state sold the fort, Governors Island, and Bedloe's Island to the federal government for one dollar. Oyster Island was similarly transferred in 1808. The federal government commenced building improved stone forts at all three locations.Wade, pp. 18, 28, 236-237 In June 1807, the Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard Affair caused a war scare with Britain that accelerated a round of fort- building in the US.Wade, pp. 115-120 This was later called the second system of US fortifications. New York Harbor became the most heavily fortified place in the United States as a result, probably the reason it was never attacked in the subsequent War of 1812. The federal forts included a complete rebuild of Fort Jay with granite and brick, mounting 60 guns, begun in 1806. At some point in 1806-07 the new fort was renamed Fort Columbus. It was joined on Governors Island by the unique, mostly circular Castle Williams, built 1807-1811. This was the United States' first multi-tiered fort, mounting 78 guns in three of its four tiers (one tier, although casemated, was used as barracks space).Castle Williams at FortWiki.com The South Battery was built on Governors Island in 1812 to guard Buttermilk Channel. Fort Wood (now the base for the Statue of Liberty) was built on Bedloe's Island from 1806 to 1811 as a stone 11-pointed star fort mounting 24 guns. Crown Fort (later Fort Gibson) was built on Oyster Island circa 1808 as a circular stone fort with 14 guns and a mortar battery. Castle Clinton (initially the West Battery) was built in 1809, a bit west of the southern tip of Manhattan on an artificial island that has since been enclosed by land reclamation. It remains as an oval stone fort for 28 guns. Another battery under construction in 1808 and completed by 1811 was the 16-gun North Battery, built of stone at the west end of Hubert Street in Manhattan.Wade, pp. 236-244 New York state acquired the Signal Hill site on Staten Island in 1806; the site was eventually named Fort Wadsworth in the 1890s. The state commenced building four forts in the area. These included the red sandstone Fort Richmond (on the site now called Battery Weed) and Fort Tompkins, on the sites of the current forts but of different design, and Forts Morton and Hudson, with positions for a total of 164 guns in the four forts.Fort Wadsworth at FortWiki.com Fort Richmond was initially semicircular while Fort Tompkins was a regular pentagon with circular bastions, both very different from their Third System replacements. These forts were contemporary with the federal second system but not part of it. Fort Tompkins was primarily a land defense fort, on Signal Hill to the rear of the other three forts. The outbreak of the War of 1812 accelerated fort construction in New York. Fort Gansevoort was built in 1812 near the west end of 12th Street in Manhattan. Fort Lafayette, a diamond-shaped stone fort with 72 guns on an artificial island near Brooklyn in the Narrows, was begun in 1815 and completed in 1822. Numerous small forts were also erected in the city. An example of a fort built with local resources was Fort Masonic in Brooklyn, built in 1814 partly by the Freemasons, a fraternal society that many Founding Fathers and early presidents of the United States were members of.Fort Masonic at the Queens Masonic District The forts around Signal Hill on Staten Island were augmented by numerous batteries; reportedly over 900 cannon were amassed in the area by the war's end in 1815. 1816-1890 1866 US Coast Survey chart of New York Bay and Harbor, showing most of the city's forts. Although New York was not attacked in the War of 1812, Washington, DC was captured and burned due to inadequate defenses locally and in the Chesapeake Bay area. A new series of masonry forts, larger than previous US forts, was proposed and became the third system of US seacoast fortifications. Funding was slow, with most forts not begun until the 1830s and several still unfinished in 1867, when building of masonry forts was halted. The New York area received six major forts under this program; initial plans for the latter four of these are said to have been drawn up by Robert E. Lee during his tenure as post engineer at Fort Hamilton in the 1840s.Roberts, p. 586Fort Richmond at New York State Military Museum Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn was the first of these forts, built 1825-1831 primarily as a land defense for Fort Lafayette. Fort Schuyler on Throgs Neck in the Bronx was built 1833-1856, defending the approach to the city from Long Island Sound. Forts Richmond and Tompkins (in the area later named Fort Wadsworth) were considered unfit for use by 1835; however, it took over a decade for the federal and state governments to arrive at a purchase agreement; work finally began on replacement forts in 1847. The two new forts were still incomplete but ready for service when the Civil War broke out in 1861. The Fort at Sandy Hook in New Jersey (later Fort Hancock) was begun in 1857, but only its seaward casemates were completed when work stopped in 1867. The Fort at Willets Point (in Queens opposite Fort Schuyler, later Fort Totten) was not begun until 1862, and only one of a planned four tiers of casemates was completed.Weaver, pp. 136‚Äì164 Although no combat of any kind took place nearby, New York City was important to the Union war effort in the Civil War. As the principal entry point for immigrants and having a large prewar population, the city provided a large share of the Union's personnel. It was also the most important media center. Paradoxically, by late 1864 the city was also a center for the Peace Democrats, and Lincoln carried New York state in that election by less than one percent. One of the most tragic events in the city's history was the draft riots of 13‚Äì16 July 1863, sparked by the implementation of military conscription by the federal government. At least 120 persons were killed. There were few troops in the city to deal with the riots, and some members of the forts' garrisons most likely served in riot control. A Confederate plot to start fires in the city on Election Day in 1864 was initially forestalled, but was executed on 25 November. Fires were set at some hotels, P. T. Barnum's museum, and other landmarks. The majority of the conspirators escaped to Canada. However, former Confederate officer Robert Cobb Kennedy was arrested, court-martialed, and hanged at Fort Lafayette on 25 March 1865.The Plot To Burn New-York.; Arrest Of Four Conspirators.

List Of The Prisoners. Published: September 24, 1861 In 1865 Fort Richmond was renamed Fort Wadsworth to honor General James S. Wadsworth, killed in the Civil War the previous year. The Civil War had shown that masonry forts were vulnerable to modern rifled cannon, particularly in the siege of Fort Pulaski near Savannah, Georgia in 1862. Also, the 15-inch (381 mm) smoothbore Rodman gun was introduced during the war. However, the Civil War's Parrott rifles had proven prone to bursting, and although many were retained in service until the 1900s, no new weapons of this type were procured after the war. To provide heavy rifled guns, many 8-inch (203 mm) \\"converted\\" rifles were produced postwar by adding liners to 10-inch smoothbore Rodman guns. New earth-protected batteries were constructed in the 1870s at a number of locations to provide more survivable forts armed with the new Rodman weapons. One of the first of these was a 27-gun battery at the Fort at Willets Point, where the US Engineer Battalion was stationed in 1866 and the Engineer School of Application was established in 1868. The school's first commander, Major Henry Larcom Abbot, worked on projects that paved the way for the Army's future coast defense efforts. He developed the \\"Abbot Quad\\" arrangement for mortar batteries with a 16-mortar battery at Willets Point, and pioneered a modern controlled underwater minefield system at Willets Point and Fort Schuyler, both of these in the 1870s.Abbot, Charles Greeley 'Biographical Memoir of Henry Larcom Abbot, 1831‚Äì1927'. National Academy of Sciences, 1929. Retrieved 24 August 2017. New earthen batteries were also built or begun at Fort Wadsworth, Fort Hamilton, and Fort Schuyler. The Sandy Hook Proving Ground was established near the abandoned, incomplete Fort at Sandy Hook in 1874 to test coast defense weapons. However, in the late 1870s coast defense funding was cut off, and it was nearly 20 years before new coast defenses began to enter service. =Endicott period= Typical US disappearing gun battery for two guns.

The Board of Fortifications was convened in 1885 under Secretary of War William Crowninshield Endicott to develop recommendations for a full replacement of existing coast defenses. Most of its recommendations were adopted, and construction began in 1890 on new batteries and controlled minefields to defend New York City, mostly near existing forts.Berhow, pp. 208-210 Fort Hancock was the first to begin construction, followed by the other Endicott forts and batteries over the next ten years. One of the Endicott program's policies was to officially assign each fort and battery a name, in most cases a deceased Regular Army or Continental Army officer's name; the fort's name usually included the entire military reservation it was on. In the 1890s and early 1900s the Fort at Willets Point became Fort Totten, the Fort at Sandy Hook became Fort Hancock, and the entire Signal Hill area (except Fort Tompkins) became Fort Wadsworth (with the previous Fort Wadsworth renamed Battery Weed). Another renaming occurred in 1904 as one of Elihu Root's last acts as Secretary of War, that of reverting Fort Columbus to its original name of Fort Jay. In addition to Forts Totten, Hancock, and Wadsworth, new batteries were built at Fort Hamilton, Fort Schuyler, and the new Fort Slocum on Davids' Island near New Rochelle, New York, which was in the approach to Forts Totten and Schuyler. In most cases the new batteries were built near the previous forts; however, about two-thirds of Fort Hamilton was demolished to make room for Endicott batteries, and almost all of the Fort at Sandy Hook was demolished to build Fort Hancock and expand the proving ground. Forts Hancock, Hamilton, and Wadsworth were the Coast Defenses of Southern New York and Forts Schuyler, Totten, and Slocum were the Coast Defenses of Eastern New York. These appear to have initially been Artillery Districts, were renamed as Coast Defense Commands in 1913, and again renamed as Harbor Defense Commands in 1924. Fort Hancock's first batteries were prototypes. The first was the Gun Lift Battery (later Battery Potter) and the second was the Sandy Hook Mortar Battery (later Battery Reynolds-McCook).The Defenses of Sandy Hook (from a Sandy Hook, Gateway National Recreation Area, U.S. National Park Service information pamphlet. Accessed 2008-02-22.) The Endicott Program centered on disappearing guns, which would remain concealed behind a concrete-and-earth parapet until raised to fire. Most of the weapons in the program were mounted on Buffington-Crozier disappearing carriages. However, early on there was doubt that this carriage could successfully raise and lower a 12-inch (305 mm) gun. The alternative developed was the gun lift carriage, essentially a barbette carriage mounted on a hydraulic elevator. A steam plant powered the hydraulic system.Fort Hancock, NJ at FortWiki.comBerhow, pp. 130‚Äì133 The gun lift system proved expensive to build and operate, as the steam plant had to be running continuously to provide pressure for elevator operation. Other early 12-inch gun installations (and a few smaller early installations) were on simple non-disappearing barbette carriages until Buffington-Crozier carriages were developed for later installations. For 12-inch guns, the first disappearing carriage was the M1896.Berhow, pp. 138‚Äì139 Although a few other installations such as Battery Torbert at Fort Delaware were begun as gun lift batteries, these were completed with disappearing guns, and Battery Potter was the only gun lift battery completed. In 1903 Battery Potter was named for Joseph H. Potter, a Civil War general. By 1907 several additional batteries were built at Fort Hancock, and with the construction of Battery Arrowsmith underway to cover its sector, Battery Potter was disarmed. The Sandy Hook Mortar Battery was a battery of 16 12-inch (305 mm) mortars in the \\"Abbot Quad\\" arrangement, pioneered at the Fort at Willets Point twenty years earlier by Henry Larcom Abbot. This was designed to place the mortars as closely together as possible, in the hope of scoring multiple hits on an enemy ship by firing simultaneously. The battery had four pits in a square arrangement, with four mortars per pit, also in a square. The pits were separated by walls and were surrounded by a high concrete wall covered with earth for land defense. This arrangement was used at a number of early Endicott forts. However, simultaneously reloading the mortars in each pit proved cumbersome, and in later forts the pits were arranged in a line with open backs. During World War I the two rear mortars in each pit were removed at most forts to further improve reloading and provide weapons for a railway artillery program. Fort Hancock had another unusual battery from 1896 to 1902, \\"Battery Dynamite\\" with two 15-inch (381 mm) and one 8-inch (203 mm) pneumatic dynamite guns. These guns used compressed air to fire a large projectile loaded with dynamite. However, the projectile's velocity was too low for effective fire control against moving targets, and the weapon was abandoned in the early 1900s. The initial armament of the forts was quite extensive. The Coast Defenses of Southern New York (CD Southern New York) were as follows: by the end of 1905 Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook, New Jersey, had eight 12-inch (305 mm) guns, sixteen 12-inch mortars, five 10-inch (254 mm) guns, four 6-inch (152 mm) guns, one 5-inch (127 mm) gun, and four 3-inch guns. Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn had six 12-inch guns, eight 12-inch mortars, seven 10-inch guns, fourteen 6-inch guns, two 4.72-inch guns, and four 3-inch guns. Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island had eight 12-inch guns, four 10-inch guns, five 8-inch (203 mm) guns, four 6-inch guns, two 4.72-inch guns, and fourteen 3-inch guns. Also by the end of 1905, the Coast Defenses of Eastern New York (CD Eastern New York) had at Fort Slocum on Davids' Island sixteen 12-inch mortars, two 6-inch guns, and two 5-inch guns. Fort Schuyler on Throgs Neck had two 12-inch guns, two 10-inch guns, two 5-inch guns, and two 3-inch guns. Fort Totten in Queens had eight 12-inch mortars, two 12-inch guns, two 10-inch guns, two 8-inch guns, two 5-inch guns, and six 3-inch guns. Generally, the heavy batteries were built first, followed by the 3-inch and then the 6-inch batteries. However, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in early 1898. Most of the Endicott batteries were still years from completion, and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. A number of batteries of medium-caliber rapid-fire guns were hastily built, along with batteries of Civil War-era smoothbore Rodman guns. Fort Wadsworth and Fort Hamilton each received a pair of 4.72-inch (120 mm) Armstrong guns, purchased from the United Kingdom, 40 calibers long at Fort Wadsworth and 45 calibers long at Fort Hamilton.Gun and Carriage cards, National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group 156, Records of the Chief of Ordnance, Entry 712 Fort Wadsworth also received a pair of 6-inch (152 mm) Armstrong guns. Batteries for a total of six 8-inch (203 mm) guns were also built at locations that are unclear from references, including three modern 8-inch M1888 guns on modified 1870s Rodman carriages and three 8-inch Rodman converted rifles.Congressional serial set, 1900, Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain, Vol. 7, pp. 3778‚Äì3780, Washington: Government Printing Office At least two of the M1888 guns were at Fort Wadsworth. In 1907, with the completion of the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound on islands to the east of Long Island, Fort Slocum was deemed surplus and removed from its coast defense command. However, the fort retained its guns until the United States entered World War I.Fort Slocum at FortWiki.com Three 8-inch guns and six 3-inch guns were added at Fort Hancock by 1910. In 1913 Fort Hamilton's pair of 4.72-inch/45 caliber guns was moved to Hawaii, due to centralizing this type of weapon there. In 1915 the battery of five 8-inch guns at Fort Wadsworth was disarmed and abandoned due to inferior concrete.Battery Duane, Fort Wadsworth at FortWiki.com At some time prior to 1917 Fort Hancock separated from CD Southern New York as the Coast Defenses of Sandy Hook (CD Sandy Hook). =World War I= Although neutral in the early part of World War I, the United States was producing munitions (primarily artillery ammunition) for the Allies: the British blockade of Germany prevented trade with the Central Powers after 1915. The Black Tom explosion occurred at an ammunition storage area in Jersey City, New Jersey, near Liberty Island, on 30 July 1916. It broke windows in lower Manhattan and damaged the Statue of Liberty's raised arm; since then tourists have not been allowed to visit the torch. The blast was initially reported as an accident, but years later was acknowledged to be sabotage by agents working directly and indirectly for Germany.Witcover, Jules. Sabotage at Black Tom: Imperial Germany's Secret War in America, 1914‚Äì1917. Chapel Hill, N.C.: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1989. The American entry into World War I in April 1917 brought many changes to the Coast Artillery and the coast defense commands in the New York area. Numerous temporary buildings were constructed at the forts to accommodate the wartime mobilization. As the only component of the Army with heavy artillery experience and significant manpower, the Coast Artillery was chosen to operate almost all US-manned heavy and railway artillery in that war. At most coast defense commands, garrisons were drawn down to provide experienced gun crews on the Western Front, mostly using French- and British-made weapons. However, this did not initially occur at CD Southern New York, where some batteries were directed to be ready to fire 24/7. Some weapons were removed from forts with the intent of getting US-made artillery into the fight. 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch guns and 12-inch mortars were converted to railway artillery,US Army Railway Guns in World War I while 5-inch and 6-inch guns became field guns on wheeled carriages.Williford, pp. 92-99 12-inch mortars were also removed to improve reload times by reducing the number of mortars in a pit from four to two; this happened at Fort Hamilton to provide mortars elsewhere. Few US Army railway artillery pieces were mounted and few or none saw action before the Armistice; however, a railway artillery force was built up prior to the Treaty of Versailles in mid-1919 and remained in service or in reserve through early World War II. The remounted 5-inch and 6-inch guns were sent to France, but their units did not complete training in time to see action.Coast Artillery Corps Units in France in WWI By this time, pedestal mounts for 6-inch guns were known to be superior to disappearing mounts, being able to more rapidly track targets with a faster rate of fire. Thus, most disappearing guns (except the M1897, shorter than the others) were dismounted for use as field guns, while most of the few pedestal guns dismounted were returned to the forts soon after the war. The removed 6-inch disappearing guns (primarily M1903 and M1905) were stored and many returned to service in World War II. Weapons removed from the New York City forts for potential service overseas were as follows: all of Fort Slocum's weapons, Fort Schuyler's pair of 5-inch guns, Fort Totten's pairs of 12-inch, 10-inch, 8-inch, and 5-inch guns (the 10-inch guns went to Fort Hamilton), three 10-inch guns and 8 6-inch guns at Fort Hamilton, two 10-inch guns at Fort Wadsworth, and only one 5-inch gun at Fort Hancock. At Fort Totten, only eight mortars and six 3-inch guns remained. In 1917 one mortar from each pit of the mortar battery at Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook was removed to create a battery at the new Highlands Military Reservation (a.k.a. Navesink Military Reservation), in Navesink, NJ near the base of Sandy Hook.Highlands Mil Res at FortWiki.com Four mortars were removed at Fort Hamilton to create a battery at Camp Rockaway Beach, later Fort Tilden, in Far Rockaway, Queens. Two pairs of 6-inch guns on pedestal mounts were also relocated there, from Fort Slocum and Fort Hamilton.Fort Tilden at FortWiki.com Also in 1917, construction began at Fort Hancock on two batteries of a new type: 12-inch guns on long-range barbette carriages. There were two guns per battery, initially without cover but positioned where they were difficult to see from the ocean. Each battery had a large earth-covered concrete bunker for ammunition and fire control. These batteries were completed in 1921. The long-range carriage was developed in response to the rapid improvement of dreadnought battleships in the naval arms race. References indicate that the authorized strength of CD Eastern New York in World War I was 13 companies, that of CD Southern New York was 45 companies, including 13 from the New York National Guard (NYNG), and CD Sandy Hook was 24 companies, including 12 NYNG. =Interwar= 12-inch gun M1895 on M1917 long- range barbette carriage, similar to the first emplacements of this type at Fort Hancock. 16-inch gun M1919, similar to the first emplacements at Fort Tilden. In 1919 the Sandy Hook Proving Ground was disestablished and its functions transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground. The mortars at Camp Rockaway Beach were replaced with railway mortars, as the fixed mortars were very near Naval Air Station Rockaway and could cause damage there when fired. In 1920 the mortars at Highlands Military Reservation were removed, and the mortars in Rockaway were withdrawn in 1921, although the 6-inch guns remained.Fort Tilden mortar battery, archived from Geocities Circa 1920-1923 the mortar batteries at Fort Hancock were disarmed, but the mortar battery later became a harbor defense command post. During and after World War I two- or three-gun antiaircraft batteries armed with M1917 3-inch (76 mm) guns on fixed mounts were built at some forts. Some of these weapons remained in service through early World War II; others were replaced by towed 3-inch guns in the 1930s. During World War I, in response to rapid improvements in dreadnought battleships, the Coast Artillery developed a new weapon, the 16-inch gun M1919 (406 mm). The first of these was deployed at Fort Michie in the Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound, on an improved disappearing carriage with elevation increased from 15¬∞ to 30¬∞. However, shortly after developing this carriage, the Coast Artillery's experience in delivering plunging fire with howitzers on the Western Front (especially the French-made French-made 400 mm (15.75 inch) Mod√®le 1916 railway howitzer) was used to develop a new barbette carriage with a 65¬∞ elevation, thus maximizing the guns' range and exploiting weak deck armor on potential target ships. All subsequent US 16-inch gun installations used the high-angle carriage, and no further disappearing emplacements of any kind were built for the Coast Artillery.Miller 1921, Vol. II, p. 109Ordnance, pp. 147-149 HD Southern New York received two (of seven total) of these weapons, at Fort Tilden in Far Rockaway, Queens. The new battery was built 1921-1923. Like the long-range 12-inch weapons, these were initially in open mounts. In 1919-1920 several weapon types were declared obsolete and removed from coast defenses. These included all 5-inch guns, all Armstrong guns (6-inch and 4.72-inch), and 3-inch M1898 guns. Only in rare cases were these weapons replaced. On 1 July 1924 the harbor defense garrisons completed the transition from a company-based organization to a regimental one, and on 9 June 1925 the commands were renamed from \\"Coast Defenses...\\" to \\"Harbor Defenses...\\" as Harbor Defense Commands. The 5th Coast Artillery regiment was the Regular Army component of HD Southern New York from 30 June 1924 through 24 February 1944. The 7th Coast Artillery regiment was the Regular Army component of HD Sandy Hook from 30 June 1924 through 24 February 1944. The 244th Coast Artillery regiment (tractor-drawn) (155 mm gun) was a New York National Guard component of HD Southern New York and HD Sandy Hook until shortly after mobilization on 16 September 1940. The regiment then moved to HD Chesapeake Bay, and none of its components returned to HD New York for the duration of hostilities. The 245th Coast Artillery regiment was the primary New York National Guard component of HD New York from 1 January 1924 through 7 October 1944. The 52nd Coast Artillery regiment, initially with 8-inch M1888 railway guns, was stationed at Fort Hancock in 1940 and sent detachments to Bermuda and Newfoundland in early 1941, with most of the regiment transferred elsewhere in 1941-42. In early 1942 the remaining railway artillery units at Fort Hancock were rearmed with ex-Navy 8-inch Mk. VI railway guns, two batteries of which were transferred to Fort Miles, Delaware in March and September 1942. Most of the remainder of the regiment was transferred to Fort John Custis, Virginia by 1 May 1943, when it was broken up into battalions. One battery remained at Fort Hancock until March 1944, when it was deactivated.National Guard Coast Artillery regiment histories at the Coast Defense Study GroupStanton, p. 458 On 10 July 1926 lightning sparked a catastrophic series of explosions at the Lake Denmark Naval Ammunition Depot (now Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway Township, New Jersey). This led to a greater concern for ammunition safety. In 1935 the Harbor Defenses of Eastern New York effectively completed disarmament; however, the command was not inactivated until 1942. Fort Schuyler became the State University of New York Maritime College, Fort Slocum had already been disarmed, and Fort Totten was disarmed except for four 3-inch guns, which remained through World War II. It is possible that the minefield capability also remained through World War II. Fort Slocum and Fort Totten remained as administrative and training posts, especially for air defense systems post-World War II. Fort Slocum was closed in 1965, and Fort Totten followed in 1974, although the latter remains an Army reserve center. =World War II= 16-inch casemated gun, similar to those at Fort Tilden and the Highlands Military Reservation. Early in World War II numerous temporary buildings were again constructed at the forts to accommodate the rapid mobilization of men and equipment. After the Fall of France in 1940 the Army decided to replace all existing heavy coast defense guns, except the long-range 12-inch guns, with 16-inch guns. In the New York area, one of the few with a pre-war 16-inch installation, this meant one additional two-gun battery at the Highlands Military Reservation. This was Battery 116, built in 1942-43 with two ex-Navy 16-inch Mark 2 guns. This battery, along with the 16-inch battery at Fort Tilden and the long-range 12-inch batteries at Fort Hancock, superseded all other heavy weapons in the New York City area. All of these batteries were casemated during the war with heavy concrete enclosures for protection against air attack. Two additional 16-inch batteries, Battery 115 at Fort Wadsworth and Battery 117 near what is now JFK Airport, were proposed but not built. The 16-inch batteries were supplemented by new two-gun 6-inch (152 mm) batteries. These included heavy earth-covered concrete bunkers for ammunition and fire control, with the guns protected by open-back shields. The guns for these batteries were mostly the 6-inch guns removed in World War I for field service and stored since that war; a new 6-inch gun M1 of similar characteristics was developed when this supply of guns began to run out. Three of these batteries were built in the New York area, Battery 220 at Fort Tilden, Battery 218 at Fort Wadsworth, and Battery 219 at the Highlands Military Reservation. However, only Battery 219 was armed. Six 90 mm gun (3.5 inch) Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) batteries were built in the New York City area. These had 90 mm dual-purpose (anti- surface and anti-aircraft) guns. Each battery was authorized two 90 mm guns on fixed mounts, two on towed mounts, and two single 40 mm Bofors guns, although the weapons on hand may have varied. AMTB 7 and 8 were at Fort Hancock, with AMTB 21 at Rockaway Point (along with two relocated 3-inch guns), AMTB 19 at Norton Point (along with four 3-inch guns), AMTB 12 at Swinburne Island, and a battery of unknown designation at Miller Field. As the new defenses were built, in 1942-43 the vast majority of the older guns were scrapped. However, the 6-inch pedestal guns and some of the 3-inch guns were retained in service through the end of the war, with some relocations. Following mobilization in 1940 the HD New York commands were subordinate to First Army, with headquarters at Fort Jay. On 24 December 1941 the Eastern Theater of Operations (renamed the Eastern Defense Command three months later) was established, with all east coast harbor defense commands subordinate to it, along with antiaircraft and fighter assets. Its headquarters was also at Fort Jay. This command was disestablished in 1946. On 4 May 1942 the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound were inactivated and consolidated with the Harbor Defenses of New York. On 9 May 1942 HD Southern New York merged with HD Sandy Hook and a remnant of HD Eastern New York into the Harbor Defenses of New York. HD Southern New York, HD Eastern New York, and HD Long Island Sound were disbanded on 22 May 1944.Conn, pp. 33-35Stanton, p. 480 The 265th Coast Artillery Regiment (HD) of the Florida National Guard was stationed at Fort Hancock and operated defenses there from February through June 1943, then was transferred to Alaska. The US Navy also participated in defending the New York area with net defenses and submarine-detecting indicator loops, including stations at Fort Tilden and Fort Hancock, with an administrative HQ at Fort Wadsworth.Indicator loop stations at Fort Tilden and Fort Hancock The removal of most weapons and an Army-wide shift from a regimental to a battalion-based system meant more organizational changes in New York's defenses. On 24 February 1944 the 5th and 7th Coast Artillery regiments were effectively disestablished, and on 7 October 1944 the 245th Coast Artillery was redesignated as the 192nd and 245th Coast Artillery Battalions, which themselves were disestablished on 1 April 1945. Personnel from these units were absorbed by HD New York.Stanton, pp. 489, 492 =Post World War II= Following the war, it was soon determined that gun defenses were obsolete, and they were scrapped by the end of 1948, with remaining harbor defense functions turned over to the Navy. In 1950 the Coast Artillery Corps and all Army harbor defense commands were dissolved. Today the Air Defense Artillery carries the lineage of some Coast Artillery units. An extensive system of 90 mm and 120 mm antiaircraft guns was emplaced in Greater New York in the late 1940s,Cold War AAA sites in NYC at American Forts NetworkList of US 1950s AA gun sites and units at Ed-Thelen.org followed by Nike missile systems in the 1950s; both of these systems reused many of the coast defense sites.Defending Gotham: Nike missile defenses of the New York metro area by Donald E. Bender The Nike missiles were removed in the early 1970s. Present 16-inch Mark 7 gun displayed at Fort John Custis, Virginia, similar to the display at Hartshorne Woods Park, the former Highlands Military Reservation. Fort Wadsworth, Fort Tilden, and Fort Hancock are parts of the Gateway National Recreation Area, managed by the National Park Service and open to the public. Fort Jay and Castle Williams are in Governors Island National Monument, also a national park; they are also open to the public with a collection of Civil War-era cannon and good interpretive signage. The third system fort at Fort Schuyler has been fully converted to office space as part of the State University of New York Maritime College. The old fort is well-preserved, but the Endicott batteries are all demolished or buried. A magazine for the 12-inch battery and a mostly-buried mine casemate remain. Fort Slocum has been mostly demolished; however, a 15-inch Rodman gun remains on the island, along with three of the four mortar pits an 1890s practice battery. Fort Totten is partly used as an Army Reserve center; the stone fort is open to the public but the preserved Endicott batteries are not. The minefield control area is largely intact, but is in use by the New York Police Department. The former Fort Totten Officers' Club, one of many buildings in the United States resembling the Army Corps of Engineers' castle symbol, is now home to the Bayside Historical Society.Coast Defense Study Group newsletter, August 2017, pp. 5-18 Fort Wood remains as the foundation of the Statue of Liberty; Fort Gibson on Ellis Island was demolished in 1892 to make room for the immigration station, and a plaque on the island commemorates it. Castle Clinton remains intact and is used for concerts. Fort Gansevoort was demolished in 1854; the North Battery also no longer exists. Fort Lafayette was demolished in 1960 to make room for the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Fort Hamilton is the last active Army post in New York City; a number of weapons are displayed at or near the fort, although none of the Endicott batteries remain. These include an experimental 20-inch Rodman gun, the largest US-made weapon of the Civil War era, in John Paul Jones Park just north of the fort (with many projectiles for it at the fort), 10-inch Rodman converted rifles on the fort property, and an ex-Navy 12\\"/45 caliber Mark V Mod 8 gun, generally similar to the biggest guns at the fort in the Endicott era. Only about a third of the old fort remains intact; however, the fort's remaining caponier houses the Army's Harbor Defense Museum. Most of the Endicott batteries at Fort Wadsworth have been buried. Paradoxically, much of Battery Duane, the 8-inch battery abandoned in 1915, remains intact near Fort Tompkins. The third system forts Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins are also intact. Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins are only accessible on a ranger-led tour. Battery Dix, Battery Barry, and many of the 1870s emplacements remain unburied but are deteriorating. Fort Tilden's 16-inch battery can be viewed but not entered. The former Nike Site NY-49 is in use by the park service and not open to the public. Fort Hancock has one of the largest collections of preserved Endicott batteries anywhere, including various experimental batteries at the former proving ground. Significant remains include the dynamite gun battery and the test battery for the 14-inch gun turrets of Fort Drum in Manila Bay, Philippines. Many of the garrison buildings survive, and there are a 20-inch Rodman and a 10-inch Rodman on site. Also rare are the pair of remounted 6-inch M1900 guns at Battery New Peck a.k.a. Battery Gunnison. Only a small part of one wall of the third system fort, with four embrasures, remains. Nike Site NY-56 is partially preserved, with a radar area and some display missiles. The Highlands Military Reservation is now Hartshorne Woods Park, and a Navy 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun has been placed on display at one of the 16-inch casemates.

The Chevron in green, the school color, with its charges, shows its history. It is now the seat of the Artillery District shown by the crest, the star indicating a general officer, the arm with sword the power of command. =Harbor Defenses of Southern New York= *Blazon **Shield: Vair, three bars gules, jessant from the middle one a demilion saliant, ragardant or.Berhow, p. 578Coat of Arms for the Harbor Defenses of Southern New York, Coast Artillery Journal, July 1928, vol. 69 no. 1, p. 73 **Crest: On a wreath of the colors (argent and azure) a beaver couchant proper. **Motto: The motto Volens et Potens (Willing and Able). *Symbolism: The crest is the beaver of New York, the only charge on the original arms of New Netherland adopted in 1623, and now on the seal of New York City. The shield symbolizes the battle of Long Island, August 27, 1776, which took place near the present Fort Hamilton. The color of the field is vair, a fur, which is said to come from an animal called Varus, the back of which is blue, the belly white. Tradition relates that a Hungarian general displayed his cloak made of varus fur as an ensign to rally his men and succeeded in turning defeat into victory. Similarly Washington, after the battle of Long Island, by a masterly retreat across the East River, rendered the British victory fruitless. The three bars represent the three enemy forces under Grant and Cornwallis and the British fleet. The lion in a springing position issuing from the center bar symbolizes the piercing of Cornwallis' command by the American brigade under General Stirling. =Coast Defenses of Sandy Hook= *Blazon **Shield: The shield is artillery red on the upper half and gold below, the line between the two being embattled. On the red and rising out of the embattlements is the Statue of Liberty in gold, and in the lower half is the Sandy Hook lighthouse placed between two bursting shells. The lighthouse and shells are black, while the flames from the shells are the natural color of fire.Berhow, p. 573Coats 1923, pp. 127-129 **Crest: The crest is a gold panther, breathing fire, placed on the battlements of a red tower. **Motto: The motto is Obscurata Lucidior (Dimmed yet Brighter), and refers to the incident when the darkening of the lighthouse furthered the light of liberty in the country. **A supporter for these arms to be used in all cases except for the colors. When Hudson explored New York Bay and the river which bears his name in 1609, his ship Half Moon was anchored in the Horse-shoe near Sandy Hook, in commemoration of which the shield of these defenses is displayed in front of the Half Moon. *Background: The coat of arms was initially approved in 1919 for the Coast Defenses of Sandy Hook. In 1924 the gold panther crest was adopted by the 7th Coast Artillery Regiment.

It typically leads to a lower stream or river, or to a location where a pumping station can be economically run. Drainage tunnels have frequently been constructed to drain mining districts or to serve drainage districts. Etymology Emissary comes from Latin emissarium, from ex and mittere 'to send out'. Ancient world The most remarkable emissaries carry off the waters of lakes surrounded by hills. In ancient Greece, the waters of Lake Copais were drained into the Cephisus; they were partly natural and partly artificial. In 480 BC, Phaeax built drains at Agrigentum in Sicily: they were admired for their sheer size, although the workmanship was crude. The ancient Romans excelled in the construction of emissaries, as in all their hydraulic works, and remains are extant showing that lakes Trasimeno, Albano and Nemi were all drained by means of emissaries. The case of Lake Fucino is remarkable in two ways: the attempt to drain it was one of the rare failures of Roman engineering, and the emissary is now completely above ground and open to inspection. Julius Caesar is said to have first conceived the idea of this stupendous undertaking (Suet. Jul. 44); with the tunnels that bring his name, Claudius inaugurated what was to have been a complete drainage scheme (Tac. Ann. xii.57), but the water level dropped by just 4 meters and stabilized, leaving the lake very much there. Hadrian tried it again, but failed; and it was not until 1878 that Lake Fucino was finally drained.

Photograph by Timur York Stephan Loewentheil is an antiquarian and a rare book and photograph collector. He is the founder and president of the 19th Century Rare Book and Photograph Shop, located in Brooklyn, New York and Baltimore, Maryland. Over a career spanning more than three decades, Loewentheil \\"has excelled ‚Ä¶ in unearthing obscure bibliographic details leading to the acquisition of under-appreciated rarities, seminal documents and early historic photographic images.\\" Loewentheil has been described as a \\"super-collector,\\" whose clients include celebrities, heads of state, American Presidents, and some of the most prominent private collectors and institutional clients of rare books and photographs.  Early life  Born in Brooklyn in 1950, Stephan Loewentheil was raised in New Rochelle, New York, where he attended New Rochelle High School. In 1968, he enrolled in Washington & Jefferson College, where he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in history. In 1975, Loewentheil graduated from Cornell University Law School with a Juris Doctor. He later moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he managed a historical neighborhood restoration and redevelopment project. He devoted increasing time and energy to collecting rare books, a passion he had nurtured since his mid-20s. Eventually, Loewentheil opened his rare book store in Baltimore, calling it the 19th Century Rare Book and Photograph Shop.  Rare book and photograph acquisitions and sales  = The White House= During the 1980s, Loewentheil began selling books to the White House, through a relationship with Joseph Verner Reed Jr., Chief of Protocol to President George H.W. Bush. Reed suggested that antique books on American history and culture be given as official state gifts to foreign dignitaries, and sought the help of Mr. Loewentheil to procure these gifts. Upon Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Washington in 1990 to sign the Chemical Weapons Accord, he was presented with an original 1804 edition of John Marshall's biography of George Washington, which was acquired from the 19th Century Rare Book and Photograph Shop. Loewentheil continued this relationship with the White House through the Obama administration. = Rare book acquisitions = Loewentheil has purchased several high-profile rare books and manuscripts at auction throughout his career. In 2010, Loewentheil purchased one of the few remaining privately owned copies of William Shakespeare's First Folio at a Sotheby's auction in London, one of multiple copies of the First Folio he has owned over the years. Charles Darwin has long been of particular interest to Loewentheil, who purchased a leaf of Darwin's original manuscript of On the Origin of Species for $250,000 at Sotheby's in 2016. Loewentheil is a leading collector of and dealer in Edgar Allan Poe books and manuscripts. In 1991, he acquired the first edition of Poe's first book, Tamerlane and Other Poems, one of twelve extant copies. In 1992, Loewentheil published The Poe Catalogue: A descriptive catalogue of the Stephan Loewentheil collection of Edgar Allan Poe material. He was awarded an honorary membership by the Poe Studies Association in 2009 for his contribution to Poe scholarship. On October 14, 2020, Loewentheil bid and won another copy of the complete First Folio of \\"Comedies, Histories and Tragedies\\" by William Shakespeare. The volume was published in 1623 by English actors John Heminges and Henry Condell, friends of the playwright. After a six-minute bidding battle between three telephone buyers at Christie's New York, Loewentheil prevailed with a bid of $9.98 million--making it the most expensive printed volume of literature sold at auction to date.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/shakespeares-first-folio-sells-at- christies-for-record-dollar10m/ar-BB1a2ubM?ocid=msedgntp This volume, at least the fifth copy of the First Folio that Loewentheil has owned ‚Äì and one of only six known complete copies in private hands ‚Äì had been owned since 1977 by Mills College, a private four-year, women-only, liberal arts college in Oakland, California. = Judaica = In 2015, Loewentheil purchased the eight- page Book of Esther from the Gutenberg Bible for $970,000 at Sotheby's in New York City, with the goal of preserving it as a whole rather than selling individual pages. He also purchased, on behalf of a client, a complete set of the Daniel Bomberg Babylonian Talmud for $9.3 million in 2015, the highest price ever paid for an item of Judaica at auction. Loewentheil's personal collection includes some of the oldest surviving Hebrew Bible manuscript scrolls, including the earliest Torah scroll sheet of the Exodus story, the so-called \\"London Manuscript.\\" The manuscript contains the text of Exodus 9:18‚Äì13:2 (the Seventh through Tenth plagues, the Passover, and the Exodus). Loewentheil loaned the manuscript to the Israel Museum in 2010, where it was exhibited at the Shrine of the Book alongside another section from the same Torah scroll, the Ashkar-Gilson Manuscript, containing the text of Exodus 13:19 to 15:27. = Photography = Abraham Lincoln. Salt Print Photograph Inscribed and Signed by Lincoln to Fanny Speed, wife of his closest friend, Joshua Speed, 1861. From the Stephan Loewentheil Photography Collection,19th Century Shop Loewentheil's photography collection is rooted in early photographic methods of the 19th century ‚Äì daguerreotypes, cartes de visite, albumen prints, tintypes, and cyanotypes. Much like his rare book collection, Loewentheil's photography collection has a historical theme, featuring rare portraits of some of the most notable Americans of the 19th century - John D. Rockefeller, Abraham Lincoln, Clara Barton, and John C. Calhoun, among many others. Loewentheil has collected many images from the early American photographer Mathew Brady. Brady's whole-plate daguerrotype portrait of American politician and states-rights advocate John C. Calhoun, one of Loewentheil's most notable acquisitions, set a new record for the photographer upon its sale for $338,500 in a Sotheby's auction on April 6, 2011. The Calhoun portrait, along with a rare image of Red Cross founder Clara Barton sitting with soldiers and a personal photograph album compiled by Mark Twain, were featured in the 2011 Cornell University Library exhibition \\"Dawn's Early Light: The First 50 Years of American Photography.\\" Another Brady photograph from the Loewentheil Collection, \\"Collected for Burial\\" - taken at the Battle of Antietam - was loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for their 2014 traveling exhibition, \\"Photography and the American Civil War\\", along with Brady's own studio camera.

One highlight of the building of the collection over three decades was the acquisition of an album of 56 albumen prints by Felice Beato, which included some of the earliest photographic images of China, at an auction in Pennsylvania in 2014. The Great Imperial Palace Before the Burning, Beijing, 1860. Photograph by Felice Beato ‚Äì The Stephan Loewentheil Historical Photography of China Collection The collection, numbering more than 15,000 photographs, includes work from both international and Chinese photographers, among them Italian-born Felice Beato; British expatriates Thomas Child and William Saunders; Scottish traveling photographer John Thomson; and native Chinese photographers Pun Lun, Lai Afong and Tung Hing, among many others. The Stephan Loewentheil Historical Photography of China Collection has been exhibited both in the United States and abroad. The Collection's extensive holdings of early Peking photographs by Thomas Child were exhibited in November 2015 at the China Exchange in London, and in 2016 at the Sidney Mishkin Gallery at Baruch College in New York. Child, a British gas engineer sent to Peking to work for the Imperial Maritime Customs Service in 1870, brought his camera with him throughout his travels and created the most comprehensive photographic portrayal of 19th century Peking. A selection of 30 photographs from the Historical Photography of China Collection, including Felice Beato's rare portrait of the Old Summer Palace, taken just before its destruction by Anglo-French troops in the Second Opium War, was displayed as part of Asia Week New York in March 2017. Beginning in November 2018, 120 images from the Loewentheil China Photography Collection were shown in Beijing at the Tsinghua University Art Museum in the museum's first photography exhibition, Vision and Reflection: Photographs of China in the 19th Century from the Loewentheil Collection. The largest exhibition of 19th century photographs to be staged in China, Vision and Reflection attracted 70,000 viewers in its first two months, supporting Loewentheil's claim that \\"the public is eager for exposure to the visual and artistic record preserved by Chinese photography.\\" Su Dan, Vice Director of the museum, described the exhibit as \\"a must-see exhibition for scholars who are interested in literature, history, folklore and architecture. ... a grand feast of historical culture and artistic aesthetics,‚Äù while a young Chinese viewer remarked to the Xinhua News Agency that \\"The photos are more powerful and truthful than written words when transmitting history. Through them, I feel as if I can touch history.\\" In an interview with CNN about the exhibition, Loewentheil expressed a similar sentiment: \\"photography is the greatest preserver of history ... because it was simultaneous with the technological revolutions that were to change everything.\\" Loewentheil was also interviewed on China Global Television Network program \\"The Point with Liu Xin,\\" where he discussed the exhibition as well as the past, present, and future of photography in China. Vision and Reflection: Photographs of China in the 19th Century from the Loewentheil Collection remained on display through March 31, 2019. Loewentheil has been published and quoted extensively on the subject of early Chinese photography.  Discovery and recovery of lost and stolen books  Loewentheil has assisted in the recovery of stolen rare books and artifacts several times over the course of his career. In 1990, Loewentheil was involved in the discovery and return to the University of Pennsylvania of several stolen early editions of William Shakespeare's plays. A part-time employee of the Van Pelt Library had stolen nearly 120 rare books, including multiple quarto editions of Shakespeare plays, an incunable edition of Dante's Divine Comedy, a first edition of Thomas Paine's Common Sense, and many others. Loewentheil encountered the books at Bauman Rare Books in Philadelphia, where his suspicions were aroused that they might be stolen. After researching their provenance, he discovered that they were the property of the University of Pennsylvania, and contacted the FBI, leading to the thief's arrest and the return of the books to the Van Pelt Library. In 2013 Loewentheil returned two rare books on early American exploration and travel that had been stolen from the National Library of Sweden in the 1990s. The theft was not uncovered until 2004, when a library patron requested to view a rare map of the Mississippi River that was discovered to be missing. Soon after, library employee Anders Burius was arrested in a case that made international headlines. Further investigations revealed that Burius had stolen dozens of books, including a 1651 first edition of Hobbes' Leviathan and a 1633 collection of John Donne sonnets, from the library between 1995 and 2004, although the recovery of these volumes was hindered by Burius's suicide five days after his arrest. Years before the theft was discovered, Loewentheil unwittingly acquired two of the National Library of Sweden's stolen volumes ‚Äì a 19th-century illustrated text of the Mississippi River and a 17th-century French book on the Louisiana territory by Louis Hennepin, ‚Äì in an auction at Ketterer Kunst in Germany before selling them to a client in 1998. Loewentheil did not become aware of their theft until fourteen years later, when a stolen copy of the 1597 Wytfliet Atlas ‚Äì the earliest printed atlas of the Americas ‚Äì was offered for sale in New York, prompting the Royal Library to finally release a list of missing books. Loewentheil immediately set to work tracking down the books in order to purchase them back himself and donate them to the Royal Library, which he accomplished in 2013. Some of the returns of stolen books and artifacts Mr. Loewentheil has negotiated have gone unacknowledged, since the victimized institutions declined to report the theft publicly. Loewentheil has been active in condemning theft and fraud in the rare book industry, and has been a featured speaker in conferences (including \\"The Written Heritage of Mankind in Peril\\" at the British Library in 2015) and articles on the subject.  Organic and kosher farming  Loewentheil owns and operates an organic farm in the Catskills Region of Upstate New York. There he grows organic produce and fruit and breeds and raises cattle, sheep, turkeys, and chickens. The animals are kosher processed with the help of a shochet. The farm was borne out of Loewentheil's desire to serve food to his family and friends that he was \\"personally responsible for\\" and to carry on the increasingly threatened traditions of shechita. Loewentheil's farm reflects his belief in the necessity of taking accountability for our food in a world dominated by agribusiness. This is consistent with the Eco-Kosher Movement, a growing farm philosophy that seeks to merge traditional Jewish dietary laws with modern socio-environmental concerns in an attempt to promote sustainable farming and the highest quality meat.

The Loewentheil Collection, which numbers over 16,000 images, \\"includes 19th- and 20th-century photographs organized in several major groups: Daguerre ephemera and early photographic processes, African-American collection, Mathew Brady and the Civil War, Lincoln, Native Americans and the West, hand-colored photography, and cartes de visite.\\" In 2014, Loewentheil donated a rare Civil War-era photograph album, containing 265 photographs from noted Civil War photographer Mathew Brady and others, to the Cornell University Library, where it was celebrated as the library's eight millionth volume. Photographs from the Collection have been featured in the Cornell exhibitions Dawn‚Äôs Early Light: The First 50 Years of American Photography and The Lincoln Presidency: The Last Full Measure of Devotion. On the occasion of the retirement of Carl A. Kroch University Librarian Anne Kenney after 30 years at Cornell University Library, Mr. Loewentheil donated a unique photograph of Abraham Lincoln by Alexander Gardner to the library in Kenney's honor.

Loewentheil is a member of the Board of Trustees for his undergraduate alma mater, Washington & Jefferson College. Loewentheil has been a supporter of the New York Public Library, and of the Library's annual Young Lions Fiction Award for over a decade. Since its inception in 2001, the award, given each spring to an author under the age of 35 of a novel or collection of short stories, has honored such luminary young writers as Molly Antopol, Karen Russell, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Uzodinma Iweala.

After the French Marshal P√©tain's call for an armistice and demobilisation on 16 June the Poles had fought on, until on 19 June Polish Commander-in-Chief General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski ordered all units to withdraw to the coast to seek evacuation to the United Kingdom as part of Operation Ariel. Units unable to get on ships trying to leave Saint-Nazaire made a fighting retreat south to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, where they flocked onto the beach and the pier in the fishing port. The Gdynia-America Line passenger ships and anchored in the harbour, where local fishermen volunteered to ferry the soldiers out to them. The sea was rough and the fishing boats had difficulty approaching the side of these ships to enable the men to transfer without falling into the water. It is reported that women and children were helped aboard by sailors. Diplomats and officials of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs also embarked on these ships, and some French who had been inspired by General De Gaulle's appeal of 18 June to continue the struggle against Germany. The ships sailed early on 21 June and the Senior Naval Officer reported that 9,000 Polish troops were loaded on these two ships. We know in detail the various movements of ships through the logs that have been preserved. Sobieski was at the mouth of the Gironde river on 20 June, and arrived in Saint-Jean-de-Luz harbour on the night of 20‚Äì21 June where she immediately embarked evacuees. Batory reached the mouth of the Adour at 0700 hrs on 21 June and then began an approach to enter the port of Bayonne without anchor. However, on the recommendation of a British liaison officer, she then went to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, where troops and Polish civilian refugees were gathered. The French soldier, writer and later politician Maurice Schumann was among those who embarked on her. The arrived on 23 June and embarked about 1,100 British refugees and 300 Poles. The British liner also arrived in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, where she embarked about 3,000 troops and refugees including most of the Polish Staff and took them to Liverpool. Bad weather and low clouds prevented a Luftwaffe attack and hence another disaster like the sinking on 17 June of the British liner at Saint- Nazaire, which was laden with thousands of troops and refugees as part of Operation Ariel. Arandora Star got out of Saint-Jean-de-Luz just in time before a Luftwaffe bomber attack on the town and port began. Ettrick and Arandora Star sailed with escort provided by HMS Harvester (H19) A total of 24,352 Polish troops managed to evacuate France by the armistice deadline of 25 June, in total. One of the last evacuees was Sir Ronald Hugh Campbell, the British Ambassador to France.

He was born at Hempstead, Norfolk and died at Weston, Bath, Somerset. The son of the rector of St Andrew's Church, Hempstead, Wilkins was educated at Marlborough College and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a lower-order batsman and in his first-class matches he both bowled and kept wicket; it is not known whether he was right- or left-handed, and his bowling style is not known. He played in trial matches for the Cambridge University team in both 1857 and 1858, but made little impression in either game. However, in a first- class match for the Cambridgeshire team ‚Äì really a variation of the Cambridge Town Club ‚Äì against Surrey in June 1858, he top-scored with an innings of 26. That led to his selection, just three days later, for the Cambridge University team for the annual University Match against Oxford University and although his two innings yielded only a single run and his bowling failed to take any wickets, he retained his place for the next Cambridge University match, against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), when he kept wicket. His only game in 1859 was also the match against the MCC; in it he took his only wicket as a bowler. Wilkins graduated from Cambridge University in 1860 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was ordained into the Church of England as a deacon in 1861 and as a priest in 1862, but never took charge of a parish: instead, he served as a curate at Stawell in Somerset from 1861 to 1863, and then at two parishes in Norfolk, Belaugh from 1863 to 1873 and Gimingham from 1874 to 1878. His father died in 1876 and his mother, formerly Mary Leir from a family from Somerset, died in 1880; in 1881, Wilkins moved to Leir family properties at Weston, on the outskirts of Bath, and changed his name by royal warrant to Wilkins-Leir. He never married and lived with his sister (who retained the name Wilkins): his local newspaper obituary described him as \\"a man of retiring disposition [who] disliked publicity\\".
