Background When Smith initially proposed the idea of writing a book about a Chicago Bulls' season to potential publishers, there was no interest in it. Smith states that he got \\"90% rejection letters\\" due to a notion that though Jordan was a great player, he had not won anything important and that the Bulls were irrelevant. After more failed attempts to sell the book on his own, he then hired an agent and was able to find one to publish Smith's book.

The book generated controversy for its sometimes unflattering depiction of Michael Jordan and its discussions of infighting within the team. Among other things, it claims that Jordan once punched Will PerdueWalter LaFeber, Michael Jordan and the New Global Capitalism, Norton, 2002, p. 87. and deliberately threw hard-to-catch passes to Bill Cartwright to expose Cartwright's deficiencies. Bulls players largely criticized the book upon its release. Jordan said, \\"I'm going to laugh at it and keep moving.

Abraham van Heyden or van Heiden ( or '; 1597‚Äì1678) was a Dutch Calvinist minister and controversialist, sympathetic to Cartesianism. Life He was born in Frankenthal in the Palatinate, son of Gaspar van der Heiden the Younger, a Reformed minister and Counter-Remonstrant who moved to Amsterdam in 1608. Abraham studied theology at the University of Leiden from 1617, travelled to Heidelberg, Geneva and Paris, and was influenced by Ramism and Jean Daill√©. He returned to an appointment as minister in Naarden in 1623, moving to Leiden in 1627. In 1648 Heidanus was appointed professor of theology at the University of Leiden. In 1650 he invited Johannes Cocceius to join him on the faculty there. Battle lines were being drawn up for an extended series of controversies, in which Gisbertus Voetius of Utrecht took the other side. In 1655 Johannes Hoornbeeck contributed to the debate between Voetians and Cocceians a sabbatarian pamphlet. Heidanus wrote De Sabbate (1658 in Latin, later in Dutch) in reply; Andreas Essenius attacked Heidanus, and Cocceius became drawn in, to what became a long controversy.Israel, pp. 662‚Äì3. The position Heidanus held for decades as leader of Leiden Cartesianism eventually led to his dismissal by the university in 1676. This happened after he with Burchard de Volder and Christophorus Wittichius published a rebuttal of the university's condemnation of Cartesian and Cocceian views.

Much of his work was devoted to the relation of philosophy and modern physics, especially the philosophy of space and time and metaphysics. Life ƒåapek was born in the municipality of T≈ôebechovice in present-day Czech Republic (then part of Austria-Hungary).SVU Obituaries' Archive 1998-2001 He was married to Stephanie ƒåapek (born ≈†tƒõp√°nka ≈òe≈æ√°bkov√°), who was a school teacher in Czechoslovakia and later a housewife, and died on July 14, 1998 (aged 82), in Little Rock, Arkansas.Log Cabin Democrat Orbituaries 7/17/98 Together they have a daughter, Dr. Stella M. ƒåapek from Conway, Arkansas.Log Cabin Democrat Orbituaries 11/20/97 In 1935 ƒåapek received his Ph.D. in philosophy at Charles University in Prague. Following the German occupation, he escaped from Czechoslovakia and studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he also directed Czech-language broadcasts back to his homeland. Ten days before the Nazi invasion, ƒåapek left Paris and went to America after an odyssey via Dakar, Casablanca and a Vichy concentration camp in Morocco. During the war he taught physics in the Army Specialized Training Program at the University of Iowa, the V-12 Navy College Training Program at Doan College, and at the University of Nebraska. After the war he returned to Czechoslovakia, where he taught briefly at the Palack√Ω University of Olomouc. One month before the 1948 communist coup d'√©tat he was fleeing once again, to take up permanent residence and citizenship in the United States. In 1948 joined the Carleton College philosophy faculty. In 1962 he accepted a position as professor of philosophy at Boston University, where he served with distinction until his retirement in 1974. His visiting professorships included the Davis Campus of the University of California, Emory University, University of North Texas, Yale University, and, again, Carleton, as the Donald J. Cowling Distinguished Visiting Professor of Philosophy. In 1983 ƒåapek was honored by Carleton with a Doctor of Letters degree. Work ƒåapek was the author of numerous articles in scholarly journalsGoogle Scholarphilpapers as well as of several books. Miliƒç ƒåapek made major contributions to the understanding of the philosophical implications of relativity theory and quantum mechanics, and to the philosophy of time. He supported a dynamic view of time with real flow and genuine becoming, as opposed to the common block universe view with its static interpretation of time.Russell, Robert J. (ed.) 2004. Fifty years in science and religion: Ian G. Barbour and his legacy. p. 151, Ashgate Publ. LTD, (Google Books) ƒåapek stated that the reason why we think of time and space as \\"space-time\\" and rather than \\"time-space\\" is because we give priority to the spatial aspect in our effort to geometrize events and moments, or to render them \\"space-like\\", as Einstein said.Berg Olsen, Jan-Kyrre 2002.

It features Vishal, Trisha and Sunaina in the lead roles, with Manoj Bajpayee and J. D. Chakravarthy appearing in supporting roles. Richard M. Nathan handled the cinematography, while the film's soundtrack and score were composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and Dharan Kumar, respectively.Dharan does it for Yuvan !, Samar, Dharan Kumar. Behindwoods.com (15 January 2013). The Telugu version titled Vetadu-Ventadu, is scheduled for release on 24 January 2013, Later on, it was dubbed in Hindi as Gabbar Sher in 2016. The story revolves around a trekking guide, who is forced to leave for Bangkok under strange circumstances and witnesses a series of puzzling incidents there.Strange encounters. The Hindu (14 July 2012). After several delays finally the film was released on 13 January 2013. Plot The film opens with Sakthi, son of a forest ranger, beating up a gang that illegally cuts precious trees to earn money. Sakthi is a jungle trekker who spends his time bringing groups of tourists on trips into the jungle. Almost immediately the story changes track and introduces Sakthi‚Äôs girlfriend Rupa. The lovers soon part ways citing compatibility issues where Rupa complains that Shakthi is not the loving boyfriend she wanted. Sakthi's character is as such that he does not remember even a single detail in their love life that Rupa deems important. Rupa tells Sakthi that he does not seem to have the time for a girlfriend and that he does not even care to do so. Rupa further aggravates the situation by asking Sakthi to close his eyes and tell her the colour of the dress she was wearing right then, but Sakthi finds that he could not. Grieved, Rupa leaves Sakthi, saying this was his character and that he would not change. After three months, Sakthi still had not recovered from his break- up. However, he receives a courier from his girlfriend saying that she misses him, and a flight ticket to Bangkok where she resides now. Sakthi is overjoyed and leaves for Bangkok. Being his first trip to a foreign country, Sakthi seeks help from his beautiful co-passenger Maya. They end up becoming friends and Sakthi tells Maya about his lady love. In Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, Sakthi and Maya part ways, and Sakthi makes his way to the Buddhist Temple where Rupa had written in the letter that she would meet him at. Although he waits for hours, Rupa doesn't turn up. At night, IPS Officer Muthumaran checks on him, saying that he wasn't allowed to stay at the temple at night. Upon learning that Sakthi is a Tamilian just like himself, he offers him a place to stay while Sakthi finds his girlfriend. However, Muthumaran does imply that he does not trust women and that Sakthi should not get his hopes up high that Rupa will come looking for him. Another day, in a case of mistaken identity, Sakthi gets caught up in the middle of a shootout between two gangs, one intent on protecting him and the other seemingly hell-bent to riddle him full of holes. As the gang protecting Sakthi gain the upper hand in the firefight, they whisk him away to a posh hotel in a luxury car. Sakthi is confused and doesn‚Äôt understand why he was dragged off. A magazine in the seat next to him in the car attracts his attention and to his shock, Sakthi sees an exact look- alike on the cover of the magazine. It turns out that his doppelg√§nger, remarkably also named Sakthi, is a multi-millionaire tycoon who is adored by many and targeted by a few in Bangkok. He doesn‚Äôt know how to prove his identity as everything stands against him. Things get bizarre as Trekker Sakthi has been forcefully dropped into the role of Tycoon Sakthi and situations seem to prove him as someone he was not. In the hotel, Trekker Sakthi argues with the Tycoon Sakthi's personal assistant Manohar about his true identity. He takes out his passport and shows it to Manohar. An amused Manohar gives the passport back to Trekker Sakthi and asks if it was true that he was merely the son of a forest ranger, why would he have multiple visas of so many countries, which was expected in a businessman's passport. To his horror, Trekker Shakthi finds that his ordinary, rarely travelled Indian passport has inexplicably turned into a Thai passport with visas to several countries like Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Sakthi enlists the help of Maya, who brings him to a branch of Bangkok Bank to recover his details, hoping there would be a discrepancy somewhere to help Trekker Sakthi prove he was not Tycoon Sakthi. In a turn of events, when Trekker Sakthi signs his signature to access the Tycoon's bank account balance hoping that his different signature might be proof enough, the bank's security system shows that his signature was an exact match ‚Äì and that he had a little over half a billion US dollars in his account. At this juncture, even Maya starts to suspect that both Sakthis are the same person. Sakthi gets further and further mangled in more trouble with his assumed identity. After a long cat and mouse game, Sakthi spots Manohar again, not in a business suit as before, but as a pimp in the streets. Sakthi gives chase and beats him up enough to find out the truth ‚Äì that he was being played by two ruthless, psychotic businessmen watching his every move through hidden cameras, who have orchestrated all the bizarre situations Sakthi had found himself in before Manohar reveals the names he gets shot and falls down in the hole. Shakthi is blamed for the murder and the police do not believe his situation. Shakthi comes to know that Rupa had never written the letter. Two business tycoons Rajesh Arunachalam and John Frederick happen to be friends from childhood, born in rich families. They play a game creating problematic situations intentionally for unsuspecting people choosing randomly placing bets on them to determine whether they survive or not. In present, both villains bring a person posing as Maya's boyfriend Rohit to provoke the anger of Sakthi so that he would show his anger towards Maya. Sakthi plays the same game back at the villains with Maya, by pretending to slap and kill her (two villains think that Maya is really dead). Maya stands on a road where villains were travelling and they think she is a ghost, they panic, lose control of the car and become unconscious. Next day, Rajesh and John find themselves staying in a suite owned by them and a news broadcast shocks them ‚Äì to the whole world, John and Rajesh are dead and their funeral is taking place. They run away and end up before Shakthi and Maya. Joseph Kuriyan, Muthumaran, and Jayakumar, the people who were involved in the game arrive there, and the film ends with Shakthi and Maya walking away from the seaside while the sound of a pistol is heard which indicates that both villains are killed.

The puzzle consists of a small sphere with protruding spikes of various lengths contained within a cylinder perforated with holes of different sizes. The challenge posed by the puzzle is how to release the sphere (the hedgehog) from the cylinder (the cage).  History  The first known model of the puzzle, patented by Clarence A. Worrall. Although known mainly through the children's stories written by the Czech Jaroslav Foglar in the 1940s, Hedgehog in the Cage has its origins in the United States. The first known model of the puzzle was patented by the American inventor Clarence A. Worrall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 7 April, 1896. It has been suggested that Worrall's invention was inspired by a Japanese puzzle called the Snake and Star, which appeared in the catalogue of the games manufacturer Selchow & Righter on 25 May, 1895. The principle of both inventions is similar: solving the puzzle involves finding the correct position and angle that allows the object (\\"the hedgehog\\" or \\"the star\\") to be removed from its entrapment in the cage or the snake. The Hedgehog puzzle seems to have arrived in Czechoslovakia around 1935. It was produced at a toy factory in Roudnice nad Labem. = Mystery of the Conundrum = It was not until 1940 that it achieved its remarkable level of popularity, when Jaroslav Foglar published Z√°hada hlavolamu (Mystery of the Conundrum), the first part of his sequence of stories about the Rychl√© ≈°√≠py (\\"Rapid Arrows\\") boys' club.The first edition of the novel was published in sequels in a popular magazine Mlad√Ω hlasatel (Young Herald) from 1940. Rychl√© ≈°√≠py comics series began to appear in the magazine Mlad√Ω hlasatel (Young Herald) in December 1938, and gradually became the most popular series in the history of the Czech comics. (\\"...ps√°t o autorech a okolnostech vzniku nejslavnƒõj≈°√≠ho ƒçesk√©ho komiksu je no≈°en√≠m d≈ô√≠v√≠ do lesa...\\") However, their adventures involving the Hedgehog in the Cage are written in the standard novel form. The masked \\"Supreme Vont\\" alias \\"≈†iroko\\" (Scirocco), holding the Hedgehog in the Cage in his left hand. A screenshot from the TV series Z√°hada hlavolamu (1969). The Hedgehog in the Cage plays a key role in the story and its sequels in the trilogy, St√≠nadla se bou≈ô√≠ (The Shades are Revolting) and Tajemstv√≠ velk√©ho Vonta (Secret of the Supreme Vont). The novel tells the story of a young apprentice locksmith Jan Tleskaƒç, who invents a flying bicycle. Tleskaƒç also owns a copy of the puzzle, which he refers to as the \\"Hedgehog in the Cage\\". He succeeds in removing the hedgehog from its cage, splits the sphere in two parts and hides the plans of his invention inside it before reuniting the two hemispheres and replacing the Hedgehog inside its Cage. After Tleskaƒç's mysterious death, local children take the Hedgehog as a symbol of leadership for their secret society.based on the plot of the book:  Cultural references  From the 1940s onwards, the puzzle was manufactured in Czechoslovakia in a variety of forms and sizes. It became particularly popular in 1969 when Czechoslovak Television broadcast a TV series based on the novel. The Removing the Hedgehog from the Cage World Championship has been held annually in the Czech Republic since 2000. In 2010, an exhibition was held in the Galerie jedn√© vƒõci gallery in Prague to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the novel's publication. 70 variants of the puzzle were displayed in the exhibition. Among them was a golden Hedgehog in the Cage and Tleskaƒç's bicycle.

The project was originally conceived as an HTML5-based platform for mobile devices to succeed MeeGo. Samsung merged its previous Linux-based OS effort, Bada, into Tizen, and has since used it primarily on platforms such as wearable devices and smart TVs. Much of Tizen is open source software, although the software development kit contains proprietary components owned by Samsung, and portions of the OS are licensed under the Flora License, a derivative of the Apache License 2.0 that grants a patent license only to \\"Tizen certified platforms\\". History Tizen and the mobile software distributions it is related to. The Tizen project was formed by the Linux Foundation in 2011 as a successor to MeeGo, another Linux-based mobile operating system, with its main backer Intel joining Samsung Electronics, as well as Access Co., NEC Casio, NTT DoCoMo, Panasonic Mobile, SK Telecom, Telef√≥nica, and Vodafone as commercial partners. Tizen would be designed to use HTML5 apps, and target mobile and embedded platforms such as netbooks, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and in-car entertainment systems. U.S. carrier Sprint Corporation (who was a backer of MeeGo) joined the Tizen Association in May 2012. On September 16, 2012, Automotive Grade Linux announced its intent to use Tizen as the basis of its reference distribution. In January 2013, Samsung announced its intent to release multiple Tizen-based phones that year. In February 2013, Samsung merged its Bada operating system into Tizen. In October 2013, the first Tizen tablet was shipped by Systena. The tablet was part of a development kit exclusive to Japan. In 2014, Samsung released the Gear 2 smartwatch that used a Tizen-based operating system as opposed to Android. On May 14, 2014, it was announced that Tizen would ship with Qt. This project was abandoned in January 2017. On February 21, 2016, Samsung announced the Samsung Connect Auto, a connected car solution offering diagnostic, Wi-Fi, and other car-connected services. The device plugs directly into the OBD-II port underneath the steering wheel. On November 16, 2016, Samsung said they would be collaborating with Microsoft to bring .NET Core support to Tizen. According to Strategy Analytics research, approximately 21% of the smart TVs sold in 2018 run on the Tizen platform making it the most popular smart TV platform.

After the article was published, Samsung, whom Neiderman tried to contact months before, reached out to him to inquire about his allegations.

Many people choose to buy it from local shops rather than preparing it at home. It is sometimes served with garlic chutney. Preparation Khandvi is usually prepared from a batter of gram flour and yogurt seasoned with ginger paste, salt, water, turmeric, and sometimes green chili peppers. The batter is cooked down to a thick paste and then spread thinly on a flat surface. Khandvis are then rolled up tightly into 2‚Äì3 cm (1 inch) pieces. Khandvi is generally bite-size.

Right: When the right turns into absence of rights, the resistance is obligatory. The 2011 Bulgaria antiziganist (anti-Gypsy) protests started during the night of 23 to 24 September 2011 in the village Katunitsa and later spread to other locations all over the country, including Plovdiv, Sofia, Varna, Burgas, Pleven, Ruse, Pazardzhik, Stara Zagora and others. The reason for the unrest was the murder of a local youth, who was run over by a car by the close associate of local Roma boss Kiril Rashkov. These protests were accompanied with racist chants and called for violence against Romani. The riots in Katunitsa led to the burning of two cars and four houses, owned by different members of the family of the alleged Romani crime boss Kiril Rashkov, also known as \\"Tsar Kiro\\". The United Nations and the OSCE condemned the demonstrations and the violence. Background The protests started in response to the vehicular homicide of 19 years old Angel Petrov in Katunitsa. The murder was committed by 55 years old Simeon Yosifov, who is believed to be a close associate of crime boss Kiril Rashkov. The death of Angel Petrov was preceded by death threats involving a \\"car accident\\", which were published in the Bulgarian video-sharing website \\"vbox7\\". October protests Sofia antiziganist protest, 1 Oct 2011 Bulgarian policemen lead a dark-skinned hobby photographer away from the route of the demonstration, to prevent possible beating. White photographers shoot undisturbed. Protests continued on 1 October in Sofia, with 2000 Bulgarians marching against the Romani and what they viewed to be the \\"impunity and the corruption\\" of the political elite in the country. Volen Siderov, leader of the far-right Ataka party and presidential candidate, spoke to a crowd at the Presidential Palace in Sofia, calling for the death penalty to be reinstated, as well as Romani ghettos to be dismantled. Many of these organized protests were accompanied by ethnic clashes and racist violence against Romani. The protesters shouted racist slogans like \\"Gypsies into soap\\" and \\"Turks under the knife.\\"Anti-Roma Demonstrations Spread Across Bulgaria, The New York Times Many protesters were arrested for public order offenses. The news media labelled the protests as anti-Romani Pogroms. Political reaction According to the BBC, President Georgy Parvanov called on the protesters for \\"an end to the language of hatred\\". Parvanov and Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called a meeting of the national security council to address the issue. These protests came before the presidential elections on 23 October.

Plot Kaitlyn (Elisha Cuthbert) is a high school student whose obsession with gambling leads to her accumulating a mountain of debt. Her habit also causes a high degree of family tension. The film commences with Kaitlyn in a mathematics class. She is ecstatic because she has won a prize on a lottery ticket. It is soon revealed that Kaitlyn and her friends are saving money in order to travel to Amsterdam. Kaitlyn is a young girl who is willing to take extreme risks in order to get what she wants. She seems academically inclined. For example, she is quick to answer a question correctly even though she was not paying attention in class. She also seems to be well-respected and popular in school. For example, many of her classmates attend her birthday where they play poker and Kaitlyn manages to win the game. Kaitlyn views the recent sequence of events as a means by which to raise money for her trip. She soon becomes involved in sporting gambling in order to make more money for her trip. Her parents view her enthusiasm for sports such as basketball and football as merely a phase. Her mother suspects that Kaitlyn watches the sports in order to watch the opposite sex. Her father, however, advises her to be cautious and to never make a bet over five dollars. He also uses Kaitlyn's new interest as a means by which to teach Kaityln's brother mathematics. As Kaitlyn begins to lose money, she starts behaving more erratically. She steals her mother's credit card, becomes addicted to Internet gambling, neglects her personal appearance and some of her male classmates assault her physically because she did not pay them the money that she had promised. Because of this she then borrows money from a shady loan shark. The stakes increase when Kaitlyn becomes involved in illegal gambling. By this time, her life is out of control, she lies about the extent of her problems and she loses more money than she ever thought possible. Once her parents discover the true nature of Kaitlyn's troubles, she is at the point where she is forced by the loan shark, to use her body as a means by which to overcome her debts. Her mother rescues her and Kaitlyn admits to her family how gambling has overtaken her life. The film ends with the notion that admitting that one has a problem and obtaining help is a very different thing from actually changing one's behaviour.

Maize, known in some countries as corn, is a large grain plant domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica in prehistoric times. Every part of the ear of corn was used. Women braided the husks for rope and twine and coiled them into containers and mats. Shredded husks made good kindling and filling for pillows and mattresses. The corncobs served as bottle stoppers, scrubbing brushes, and fuel for smoking meat. Corn silk made hair for corn husk dolls. Corn husk dolls have been made by Northeastern Native Americans probably since the beginnings of corn agriculture more than a thousand years ago. Brittle dried cornhusks become soft if soaked in water and produce finished dolls sturdy enough for children's toys. Making corn husk dolls was adopted by early European settlers in the United States of America. Corn husk doll making is now practiced in the United States as a link to Native American culture and the arts and crafts of the settlers.. In some Pagan faiths, (specifically Western) corn dollies are used to celebrate Lammas. Corn dollies are magickal charms thought to protect the home, livestock, and personal wellness of the maker and their family. They may be a home for the spirit of the crop. The tradition pertains to the idea that the crop of grain has a spirit that loses its home after the final harvest and it is therefore to be invited and housed in the home over the winter before being returned to the earth in spring for the next crop. Corn husk dolls do not have faces, and there are a number of traditional explanations for this. One legend is that the Spirit of Corn, one of the Three Sisters, made a doll out of her husks to entertain children. The doll had a beautiful face, and began to spend less time with children and more time contemplating her own loveliness. As a result of her vanity, the doll's face was taken away.

This device typically consists of a glass or plastic tube with a porous ceramic cup and is filled with water. The top of the tube has either a built-in vacuum gauge or a rubber cap used with a portable puncture tensiometer instrument, which uses a hypodermic needle to measure the pressure inside the tensiometer. The tensiometer is buried in the soil, and a hand pump is used to pull a partial vacuum. As water is pulled out of the soil by plants and evaporation, the vacuum inside the tube increases. When the soil is wetted flow can also occur in the reverse direction: as water is added to the soil, the vacuum inside the tube pulls moisture from the soil and decreases. When the water pressure in the tensiometer is determined to be in equilibrium with the water pressure in the soil, the tensiometer gauge reading represents the matric potential of the soil. Such tensiometers are used in irrigation scheduling to help farmers and other irrigation managers to determine when to water. In conjunction with a water retention curve, tensiometers can be used to determine how much to water. With practice, a tensiometer can be a useful tool for these purposes. Soil tensiometers can also be used in the scientific study of soils and plants. References * Rawls, W.J., Ahuja, L.R., Brakensiek, D.L., and Shirmohammadi, A. 1993.

The technique is based on storage of electromagnetic energy in a high voltage capacitor bank, and discharge into the sintering apparatus at low voltage (<30 V) and high current through step-down transformers on a pre-compacted powder compact which is kept under pressure. The sintering mould and Electrodes are similar to those employed in field assisted sintering techniques (FAST) such as spark plasma sintering and single electromagnetic pulse sintering technologies. The method, analogous to resistive sintering, is a direct evolution of a welding technology named Capacitor Discharge Welding (Kondensator-Impulsschwei√üen). CDS seems like an improvement of the less powerful capacitor discharge compaction patented by W.Knoess and M.Schlemmer (EP 0671232, US Patent 5529746). Advantages of the technique are: * short sintering time (less than one second) * no need for a controlled atmosphere even during sintering of highly reactive materials such as titanium * the ability to obtain metastable and nanocrystalline materials (see Capacitor discharge sintering of nanocrystalline copper) Disambiguation The technique has been studied by Element Six under the name of electro-discharge sintering. This name has been adopted by many authors in the past to describe a range of different technologies which typically adopt very high voltages and completely different machines. For this reason the technique which employs low voltages and high currents adapted from capacitor discharge welding has been named capacitor discharge sintering. Other authors also refer to this technology as spark plasma compaction (in reference to the well known Spark Plasma Sintering with whom it has in common only the use of electric currents). Developments Capacitor discharge sintering is at an experimental/research stage of development in Germany at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum where a prototype machine is installed. Industrialization and evolution of the technology is ongoing in EPoS srl, a start-up company from Torino. EPoS has patented a CDS based process which is claimed to produce components with improved properties at a competitive production cost. The company active since 2010 is employing solely proprietary technologies based on CDS to develop and produce abrasives, cemented carbide blanks, and a wide range of components produced with metallic alloys, semiconductors and composites.

The novel is the third and final installment in the Leviathan series after Behemoth, released on September 20, 2011. Heir to the Austro- Hungarian throne in hiding Prince Aleksander, and Scottish midshipman Deryn \\"Dylan\\" Sharp rescue Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla from the site of a 1908 Siberian Tunguska event meteorite blast. Along the way, Alek sees through Deryn's male disguise of Dylan on the organic airship Leviathan while gradually learning of Tesla's motives of using his invented weapon Goliath to end the war on his own. Alek destroys the inventor and his Goliath weapon under German attack in New York, triggering the entry of U.S. into World War I. Plot As the airship Leviathan travels over Russia, Aleksandar, Deryn, and Newkirk are in the middy's mess with the perspicacious loris Bovril, talking about great circle routes. Alek mentions Deryn's father was an airman, but Newkirk says that the airman was Deryn's uncle. An actual living two- headed messenger eagle from the Czar heads towards the bridge, interrupting their discussion. A message lizard sends Deryn to the bridge and Newkirk to the cargo deck. Alek goes with Deryn, and there Dr Barlow tells them to take the bird to the rookery and feed it. Deryn nearly confesses her secret to Alek, but hesitates to do so thus resisting herself. She quickly asks for a fencing lesson to cover the thing up. Count Volger tries to expose her gender unless she discloses the imperial message, but drops the attempt after some convincing from Deryn, who dares not to shake the confidence of Alek, who admires 'Dylan' unaware of her masquerade as a boy. The imperial message is to pick up a couple people from a fighting bear, but it is much heavier than expected, overloaded by metal parts and tools, and drags Deryn and Newkirk down into the trees until the crew manages to compensate by dumping clart (waste water) and other supplies. Dr Barlow orders Alek, with Klopp, Hoffman, and Bauer, to assemble the metal contraption and keep it secret. The loris shows them how it detects metal with Barlow's necklace. Flying over Tunguska, Siberia, they notice the area has been destroyed, trees have been flattened and point in one direction, and many stripped corpses are present, including that of another organic airship. By dropping dried beef at a distance to distract giant starving bears, they rescue Nikola Tesla, his Russian soldiers and airship crew, who are holed up near the center of the destruction. Tesla's electrified fence, which had kept the bears away, is deactivated to allow the Leviathan to land, so he scares rogue bears with his electrified walking stick. Later at night, as Alek is unable to fall asleep, he reads a newspaper article about \\"Dylan\\" and the Dauntless by Eddie Malone. He realizes something is off about the story Deryn has told him about her family and past: Artemis Sharp had a surviving daughter named Deryn. Alek eventually becomes tired and fells asleep, with Bovril whispering \\"Mr. Deryn Sharp\\" into Alek's ear. Not long after, Dr. Barlow's requests Alek and Deryn to use Tesla's device to pinpoint the inventor's bedroom. Deryn sneaks into the room and discovers a metal lump hidden under Tesla's bed, and scrapes off a sample that they discovered out to have magnetic properties. Amidst their discussion, Alek takes up the chance of asking her, \\"Can I trust you, Deryn?\\" to which she spontaneously responds, and Alex leaves the room hiding his disappointment. Deryn, immensely shocked at the realization of Alek knowing her true identity, chases after him and they get into an argument. As the pressure eventually recedes and Deryn leaves him alone, Alek considers the fact that Deryn might have hidden her real identity out of her love for him. For a few days, Alek and Deryn are not on speaking terms. Alek decides to support Tesla in his mission to end the war with his magnetic beam, the Goliath, but sadly misses Deryn; who meanwhile is angry of his dismissal of her just because she is a girl. Sent to Tokyo just to brandish the British flag, the Leviathan battles an Austrian ship and two German zeppelins in support of the Japanese. When one of the engines is shot, both Deryn and Alek arrive to help, and Alek admits he wants Deryn back as his friend. When Dr Barlow wants Deryn to get new clothes, Alek saves her from discovery being measured by offering himself to the tailor's hands. In Tokyo, Tesla demonstrates the Goliath publicly at a conference in the Imperial Hotel, claiming the sky color will change in London. A quick correspondence with the British royal family confirms the visible colors and orders the ship to New York for Tesla. While crossing the Pacific Ocean in a storm, Alek hits his head protecting Deryn. To keep him awake after a concussion, Deryn kisses him. They promise not to keep secrets from each other, and for Alek to lie protecting her secret. Arriving at William Randolph Hearst's estate in California, Philip Francis films them. Reporter Eddie Malone is fleeing from Hearst's men, so Deryn helps him escape on board. He suggests Francis may be a German spy because he changed his last name from German. They use Tesla's detector to find arms and film hidden in kitten barrels after dinner and a cliff-hanger episode of the film Perils of Pauline, the adventuresome American female lead, which impresses Alek mightily. As the Leviathan crosses Mexico, one of its engines suddenly stops. Several men who work for the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa offer to help them in exchange for the sugar. Deryn sends one message about suspicious walkers, then dons gliding wings to investigate. She semaphores C-A-M-E-R-A in time, but injures her knee on landing. Alek gets Pancho Villa's physician, Dr. Azuela, to treat Deryn instead of the ship's Dr. Busk, but Eddie Malone overhears Deryn's secret when Azuela tells Pancho Villa. Pancho Villa and Mr. Francis film the Leviathan as part of Hearst's movie deal with Pancho. Alek takes meals and helps Deryn keep her secret from the crew, but Deryn fears punishment in New York when Eddie Malone publishes his article. Alek is planning to stay in New York and help Tesla promote Goliath, and he asks Deryn to stay in New York with him to help Tesla. Dr Barlow offers Deryn a job with the Zoological Society of London, but retracts her offer fearing a scandal from deception on the British government and the Royal Air Service after learning of Deryn's secret. Meanwhile, Alek saves Eddie Malone from falling off when a rocket hits the jitney that they are leaving on. Deryn, watching from the bridge, gets them to douse flames with waste clart water. Alek show Malone the Pope's letter to his claim to throne as emperor so the reporter will keep Deryn's secret. Dr Barlow shows Deryn the article with Alek's story, not her secret, and offers Deryn the job again. At the Serbian consulate, Lilit (who has been made the assistant to the newly founded Ottoman Republic's ambassador since the events of Behemoth) reappears and tells Deryn about a German water-walker coming to attack Goliath, so Dr Barlow convinces Captain Hobbes to keep watch. When the Leviathan sees approaching bubbles underwater, they bomb the escorts, while they leave the largest to land to prove the attack and encourage the Americans to join the war, so she sends a warning by eagle to Alek. Tesla hosts a dinner at his Tower hoping to do a demonstration that the Goliath can change the color of the Berlin sky, but under attack decides to fire for real, despite danger to Leviathan. Volger uses a smoke bomb for surprise, and Alek has to use the electrified cane of Tesla to kill the owner. The suppressed energy destroys the water-walker, so the U.S. enters the war on the Darwinist side when they see the wreckage. Dr Barlow receives a message that tells her that the sample Deryn stole from under Tesla's bed was from a meteorite, proving Goliath did not cause the Tunguska event. Alek receives a medal for going with Deryn to fix Tesla's wire on the spine. After the ceremony, Alek and the barely healed Deryn again climb the spine together. Alek tells her the truth about Tesla's death, declares his love by kissing her, and throws the Pope's scroll overboard. He rejects his past which he has already lost. When he admits to needing a job next, Deryn suggests joining her and Dr Barlow at the London Zoological Society. The last chapter is an epilogue in the form of a newspaper article by Eddie Malone. Alek had relinquished his royal title as prince, with his only comment being the Habsburg motto: Bella gerant alii, tu felix Austria, nube or \\"Let others wage war. You, lucky Austria, shall marry.\\" He and Deryn has also accepted positions to work with the Zoological Society. \\"Goliath\\" by Scott Westerfeld Bonus chapter On December 16, 2011; Westerfeld published a bonus chapter to the novel on his website.

His older brother, Domenico, was also a well-known artist and they often worked together. Biography He was born in Milan, where his father was a chef and butler at the Milanese court. He took his first formal art lessons at the Brera Academy, where he studied with Luigi Sabatelli from 1839 to 1846.Biographical notes from L'Unificazione (2011) @ Treccani. His first exhibit was in 1845; composed of portraits and a scene from The Betrothed by Alessandro Manzoni (now lost).Biography and appreciation form Dizionario Biorafico, (2004) @ Treccani. In 1848, he and Domenico were participants in the Five Days of Milan and had to flee to avoid reprisals by the Austrian government. They spent two years in Ticino, then returned and settled in Florence. His brother went back to painting, but he enlisted in a volunteer regiment led by General Giacomo Medici and fought against the French during their siege of Rome. He also managed to produce numerous sketches of the war. Departure of the Garibaldino, 1860 (Fondazione Cariplo) While engaged in the defense of the , near Porta San Pancrazio, he was stabbed with several bayonets and seriously wounded while leading a charge. After a long recovery, he was able to return to Milan under the protection of Count Giulio Litta, a composer and avid art collector. Because of his injuries, he was exempt from being inducted into the Austrian army and went to work in his brother's studio. In the following years, he created many works based on the events of the Risorgimento, as well as genre works, influenced by his brother. From 1854 to 1855, during the Crimean War, he was back in uniform; this time with the Bersaglieri of Alessandro La Marmora. Once again, he made numerous sketches that were turned into paintings and lithographs. These included a depiction of the Battle of the Chernaya that was purchased by King Victor Emmanuel II. Some of his works were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1859, despite lingering health issues, he enlisted in the Hunters of the Alps and came to be recognized by Garibaldi as the official painter of the Risorgimento, especially on matters of an official character. His genre scenes became almost entirely devoted to military themes. During the 1860s, in addition to his patriotic canvases, he created some large decorative works; including an allegory on Rome and Florence for the new Milano Centrale railway station (now demolished), and a curtain depicting the \\" of Naples\\" for the theater in Gallarate. In 1861, he received a gold medal at an exhibition in Florence for his painting of the Battle of Magenta, but gave it up in solidarity with the painters who had been overlooked. After unification had been achieved, his genre works tended to focus on scenes from the seventeenth century and he began to exhibit paintings on a wider variety of topics outside Italy, including Vienna (1873), Paris (1878), Antwerp (1885) and London (1888). His best-known work from this period is \\"A Game of Chess\\", a scene from a play of the same name by Giuseppe Giacosa. He died in Milan in 1890, after a long illness.

Angelo Inganni (November 24, 1807 ‚Äì December 2, 1880) was an Italian painter. Biography He was born in Brescia. Angelo Inganni was taught the basics of art by his father Giovanni and his elder brother Francesco, with whom he worked on fresco decorations from when he was young. Distinguished during his military service as a draughtsman and portraitist, he was noticed by Marshal Radetzky who had him admitted to the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in 1833. The work he presented regularly at the Brera exhibitions from 1834 to 1859 constitutes a vast series of urban views of Milan capturing all the details of its architecture and including likenesses of real people. This new approach to perspective painting proved a great success with the public and critics alike, as shown by a number of prestigious commissions, including from the Austrian emperor in 1839. Inganni exhibited views of various Italian cities in national and international exhibitions. It was in the 1850s, above all after his return to Brescia, that he began to produce genre works of Flemish inspiration with new subjects drawn from rural life and telling effects of light. He frescoed the churches of San Marco and San Carlo in Milan as well as the parish church of Gussago. In 1856, three years after the death of his first wife, he married his long-time pupil and model, Amanzia Gu√©rillot, who was twenty-one years his junior. They settled down near Gussago and often collaborated on canvases as well as small-scale decorative work. He died there in 1880.

In The Topper comic he drew Splodge, Willy Nilly, Foxy and Shorty Shambles. Grigg swiftly became the definitive Korky the Cat artist when he took over the artistic duties from James Crighton on the cover of The Dandy in the early 1960s. Immediately making Korky a friendlier looking figure, his covers for the weekly, and the Dandy Summer Specials and annuals, were some of the finest pieces of humour art DC Thomson were producing at that time. DC Thomson chose him to draw Desperate Dan for the specials and annuals following original artist Dudley Watkins' death in 1969. Grigg was also adept at illustrating \\"light adventure\\" stories for the publisher, with his most memorable sixties strips being The Red Wrecker and The Umbrella Men for The Dandy. When Grigg retired from regular comics work in 1983, he turned his hand to illustrating saucy seaside postcards for Bamforth. These British curiosities were hugely popular decades ago, and could be found on spinner racks outside shops in every seaside resort. However, by the time Grigg entered the field, the popularity of such postcards was in decline. Today, Bamforth saucy postcards are considered a 20th-century collectible, supplanted by holidaymaker's text messages, although some shops do still have old stock.

In 1867 he studied in D√ºsseldorf, and in 1870 he studied under Karl von Piloty at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, where he befriended Franz von Defregger. He worked initially in Budapest as a portrait and genre painter. Later, he moved to Paris, and in 1877 he moved to Vienna, and lived there with his large family (his wife Paulina and 10 children) as an emperor Franz Joseph I Court Painter until his death in 1912 in Maria Enzersdorf, Austria. Hermann Armin von Kern specialised in portraits and genre scenes. The latter often depicted children at play, music making gypsies, tavern scenes, and single persons. In 1885 he painted the ceiling decoration of the Szeged Theatre. Being a very good pianist he often made music with his friend, the composer Franz Liszt.

Early life and career  Edward Linfoot was born in Sheffield, England, in 1905. He was the eldest child of George Edward Linfoot, a violinist and mathematician, and George's wife Laura, n√©e Clayton. After attending King Edward VII School he won a scholarship to Balliol College at the University of Oxford. During his time at Oxford he met the number theorist G. H. Hardy, and after graduating in 1926, Linfoot completed a D.Phil under the supervision of Hardy with a thesis entitled Applications of the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable. After brief stints at the University of G√∂ttingen, Princeton University, and Balliol College, Linfoot took a job in 1932 as assistant lecturer, and later lecturer, at the University of Bristol. During the 1930s Linfoot's interests slowly made the transition from pure mathematics to the application of mathematics to the study of optics, but not before proving an important result in number theory with Hans Heilbronn, that there are at most ten imaginary quadratic number fields with class number 1.Proved in Heilbronn & Linfoot, 1934.  Shift to optics  The exact reasons that Linfoot chose to switch his research from pure mathematics to optics are complex and there is probably no single most important reason. John Bell has highlighted the role played by Linfoot's political awareness, in particular his relationship with Heilbronn who had been forced to flee Nazi Germany.Bell, 1984. Suspecting a second world war was imminent, and knowing his delicate constitution would not make it through military physical examinations, Linfoot decided to contribute to the future war with scientific advancements in the field of optics. Other contributing factors to this change in focus were his lifelong fondness for astronomy and, by Linfoot's own testimony, a feeling that he had reached the limits of his pure mathematical creativity.Fellgett, 1984. This shift was facilitated by Dr C. R. Burch of the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory in Bristol who led the University's optics group. Burch was a physical thinker but recognised the benefits of strong mathematical ability in understanding physics, and so encouraged Linfoot in his transition. Linfoot availed himself of the laboratory's facilities to first construct his own telescope and later to apply the theory of aspheric lenses to create a new microscope which he would exhibit at the 1939 Annual Exhibition of the Physical Society. It was also during this time, in 1935, that Linfoot would marry fellow mathematician Joyce Dancer, with whom he would have three children, Roger in 1941, Margaret in 1945 and Sebastian in 1947. During World War II Linfoot put his skills to use for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, producing optical systems for air reconnaissance.  Cambridge astronomer  Following the war, Linfoot was awarded an ScD by the University of Oxford for his work in mathematics. A few months after this, Linfoot moved to the University of Cambridge, being appointed Assistant Director of the Cambridge Observatory. He would remain at Cambridge until his retirement in 1970, eventually succeeding Dr H. A. Br√ºck as John Couch Adams Astronomer. During this time Linfoot took a great interest in Claude Shannon's new field of information theory and also in computers, writing several programs for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator at Cambridge. He also wrote two books on optics, and seems to have planned a third. His demonstrable skill at crafting optics was in demand, leading him to positions as a consultant for various groups and projects, including the construction of three large telescopes‚Äîthe Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescope, the Isaac Newton Telescope, and the Anglo-Australian Telescope‚Äîand for NASA. Linfoot died in Cambridge in 1982 at the age of 77, and is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.  Academic legacy  Linfoot's mathematical papers cover the period 1926-1939, all his subsequent work being on optics. These papers cover a wide range of areas in Fourier analysis, number theory, and probability, the first of these being applied later to his optical studies. His optics work was primarily concerned with synthesis, error balancing, assessment and testing. In particular he used his prodigious mathematical background to determine ways to improve and invent new optical configurations. He was a fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge.

Though criticised for excessive adherence to the models of his master, his work attracted the attention of the public and critics from 1908 on.

Between 1915 and 1925, Wimperis worked in the Experimental Office in the Royal Navy Air Service (RNAS). Here he was put on the problem of devising a useful bombsight that did not require manual calculations or a stopwatch to estimate the wind speed. The result was his Drift Sight, which used a small bar that was aligned with the motion of objects on the ground to measure the wind. He then greatly expanded on this design in his Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS) in 1917, introducing the first system to allow bomb runs from any direction, instead of just up or down the wind line. The CSBS has been called \\"the most important bombsight of the war\\".Christina Goulter, \\"A forgotten offensive\\", Routledge, 1995, pg. 27 Through this period he also worked for the Royal Air Force after it formed in 1918, and the Air Ministry as it took over most of the centralised research for both arms.

In June 1934, Albert Percival Rowe, Wimperis' personal assistant, became concerned about the state of air defence in the UK, and took it upon himself to read every study on the topic published in the UK. The result was a memo stating that \\"we were likely to lose the war if it starts within the next ten years\\".Raymond Watson Jr., \\"Radar Origins Worldwide\\", Trafford Publishing, 2009, pg. 60 Wimperis took the memo seriously and set about creating the Committee for the Scientific Study of Air Defence, placing Henry Tizard in the chairman's position.Hannah Gay, \\"The history of Imperial College London, 1907‚Äì2007\\", World Scientific, 2007, pg. 240 This group was instrumental in the creation of radar in the UK, and the Chain Home system that was instrumental to winning the Battle of Britain.

In 1983 Australia's National Basketball League expanded in its 5th season to include the newly formed Hobart Devils who chose the Kingborough Sports Centre as their home stadium. The Devils regularly played in front of packed houses at Kingborough despite the team's lack of success and a feature of their games was the court, which like any community based sports centre not only had the outline of the basketball court but players and officials had to contend with the markings from sports such as netball, volleyball and badminton as well. The Devils remained at the 1,800 capacity Kingborough until the end of the 1988 NBL season, during which time it became increasingly obvious that a larger venue would be needed to cater for the increased crowds the NBL was seeing at the time.

The Hobart Devils, after a six-year run at the KSC moved 16 km north into the heart of Hobart and the centre reverted to being a community based sports centre.

The show also won the award for Best Drama Series in the 2013 Yahoo OMG! awards, and was nominated in the 27th PMPC Awards as Best Primetime Drama Series of 2013. Plot Celyn Buenaventura (Kim Chiu) was an ambitious and kind working-class girl living in Cebu with her widowed mother, Theresa Apolinario (Cherry Pie Picache). One day, she received an acceptance letter from the University of the Philippines Diliman, but Theresa was furious and refused to let her go. Celyn thus travelled alone to Manila, and upon arriving was employed by the owner of a carinderia, who allowed her to sleep in the eatery. On the first day of school, Celyn met Margaux Marasigan (Maja Salvador), the daughter of Julio (Ariel Rivera) and Beatrice Marasigan (Janice de Belen), owners of the famous Memorata shoe company. Margaux lived the luxurious life of an heiress, and Celyn looked up to her in admiration. Celyn also met her friends, Ethan Castillo (Enchong Dee) and Liam Lagdameo (Xian Lim); she and Liam were initially irritated with each other and she remembered Ethan from a childhood incident where he seemingly saved her life. Celyn and Margaux eventually became best friends. Celyn found out that Ethan and Margaux were lovers. Margaux may have led a life like a princess, but she was often concerned about her mother's strictness. Margaux follows everything Beatrice says, but she knows that her family is against Ethan. They kept their relationship a secret. Celyn found out that Liam has a lifelong crush with Margaux, who was his best friend. They promised not to tell anyone when Liam also found out Celyn likes Ethan. Beatrice showed great dislike to Celyn because she believes Celyn is changing Margaux, while Julio defended Celyn. Theresa decided to moved to Manila with her father, Zacharias (Ronaldo Valdez), and was found by Julio, who confronted her and asked where she took his real child. Theresa tried to hide Celyn from Julio, but they already met each other. Ethan's father ran away because Lucas thought that he is the one who took his money. When Margaux and Ethan decided to elope, they were thwarted by Beatrice after Celyn informed her of the escape attempt. Margaux couldn't believe Celyn would betray her, and their feud began. Ethan tried to get Margaux back, but she denied their relationship, leaving Ethan lonely and depressed. Celyn and Ethan became closer together and Ethan confessed his feelings for Celyn. Margaux longed for Liam's company, but Liam always tried to defend Celyn whenever Margaux taunted her. Celyn was hurt at how Margaux treated her. Beatrice, who was really Theresa's maternal half- sister through their mother Yolanda, found out that Julio and Theresa were meeting each other. Infuriated, she lashed out at Theresa and confrontations ensued. Julio then revealed to a shaken Celyn that she was actually their missing daughter, and Beatrice immediately regretted hating her. Beatrice remained opposed to Theresa, and legal issues about who gets Celyn started. They agreed that Celyn will stay in Beatrice's house for the weekdays and Theresa's at the weekends. Now graduated, Celyn and Margaux's feud intensified as Margaux became more confident, determined to destroy Celyn who bested her by becoming vice-president at Memorata. Margaux thought she loves Liam and craves for his company, and Celyn forgives Ethan, after a dispute during their graduation. Celyn remained angered at Liam, and Liam confessed his feelings to Celyn. A jealous Margaux tried to win Liam back. Theresa's cousin, Oscar, has flashbacks of Theresa's pregnancy; when the midwife delivered twins, he decided to kept it a secret. The original plan was that Beatrice and Julio raise the child after its birth, but Theresa refused, saying that she carried the children and was thus their mother. After Theresa gave birth, Oscar took one child and gave it to Beatrice as promised. It was revealed that Celyn and Margaux were the babies delivered of Theresa and Beatrice, and Zacharias admits to having engineered the exchange, adding he did so to keep the peace between the two half sisters. Margaux's hatred towards Celyn became more relaxed but dangerous; she is a part of the family after all. Mio Buenaventura (John Regala), who was Theresa's deceased husband, is revealed to have faked his death and now seeks revenge. Mio shot Julio, sending him into a coma, and while waiting on him in hospital, Celyn and Margaux reconciled and prayed for their father's recovery. Julio woke up and was discharged, but Mio still threatened them. Theresa eventually realized that Ethan's friend, Diego Medina (Alex Medina) - who had become close to her when she went back to university ‚Äì was Joshua, her long-lost firstborn whom Mio had spirited away years before. Driven by guilt and grief, Theresa tried to get Diego back. Celyn and Ethan spied around Mio's house, trying to find evidence confirming their theory of a link between him and Diego. Mio caught them, allowing Ethan to escape and holding Celyn hostage, torturing her repeatedly. Mio asked for an exorbitant ransom from Lucas Elizalde, Beatrice's father, who was Mio's employer and thus the mastermind. Lucas, who wanted Mio dead lest he be implicated, agreed and sent him the money through Theresa. In the rescue operation, policeman fired at Mio while Diego escaped, taking Celyn with him to an abandoned kitchen. Panicking, Diego randomly fired his gun, causing several LPG tanks to explode and burn the room. Margaux tried to save Celyn from the flames, but both were eventually rescued by Liam, while Mio was placed under hospital arrest. Lucas planned Mio's escape attempt because Diego had blackmailed him. After having a happy reunion, Liam proposed to Celyn, which she accepted. They all learned that Mio had escaped, and he visited Theresa again, stabbing Liam three times and before disappearing once more. Beatriz then planned to flee to Singapore for their safety, and she finally reconciled with Theresa one night, amidst hugs and tears. Margaux, Theresa, Celyn and Beatrice were then kidnapped by Mio and Diego. Lucas, who had gone to hiding with the two men after being exposed, saw Beatrice and he text Yolanda on their location. When police reinforcements came in, Mio ordered Diego to shoot his own mother, which he refused to do after a nervous breakdown. Angered, Mio tried to wrest the gun from Diego, and after a struggle pulled the trigger, shooting his son before a distraught Theresa. Diego asked her to forgive him and died, causing Mio to roil in emotional agony for killing his own son. Theresa managed to flee with the others, but Mio cornered them. He was about to shoot Theresa when Julio arrived and shot Mio. They all hugged each other while Ethan and Liam ran to meet them, but Mio stirred and shot Theresa in the back before being killed by the police. In the hospital, Theresa came close to death, but survived the gunshot wound. The last scenes showed Celyn and Margaux over Joshua's grave, saying they forgive him, and pictures of Margaux & Ethan and Celyn & Liam, married to each other. Lucas (Eddie Gutierrez) was in prison being visited by Yolanda (Pilar Pilapil), who forgave him for what he did. Celyn and Margaux eventually became pregnant, with Liam and Ethan by their sides, and Celyn gave birth, followed by Margaux. The series ends with scenes of the entire extended family in church for the baptism of the babies, with Celyn and Margaux's babies holding hands while their mothers' arms.

Completed in 1994 and located a few kilometres inland on a mountain side near S'Horta, it is the second house Utzon built on the island. Like the earlier Can Lis, it is built in the local sandstone and consists of separate blocks for living, eating and sleeping. \\"Utzon Houses\\", Contemporary Baleares. Retrieved 28 September 2011.\\"Mallorca, Can Feliz, eget hus 2, Spanien\\", ArkArk.dk. Retrieved 28 September 2011. Background Utzon visited Mallorca in 1966 when returning from Australia after disagreements with the authorities about how to complete his iconic Sydney Opera House. He was enchanted by the island and decided to build a summer residence there. Can Lis, completed in 1971, stands on the top of a cliff near Portopetro. By the 1990s, the Utzons were spending much of their time there but they were increasingly bothered by the glare of the sun, the pounding of the waves and architects coming to see the house. Utzon therefore decided to build a second house, this time on a more remote, inland site. He took an active part in building the house as he had at Can Lis, making quite substantial changes along the way. Utzon presented the house to his wife Lis on the occasion of their golden wedding, wrapping a red ribbon around the building. Architecture The design of Can Feliz is similar to that of Can Lis in that it is built in blocks, one for living and working, the second for the kitchen and dining room, and the third for bedrooms. But unlike Can Lis, it is built round a terrace like the island's local dwellings, and has just one tiled roof covering all three sections.\\"Can Lis and Can Feliz in Mallorca, by J√∏rn Utzon\\", Stories of Houses. Retrieved 28 September 2011. The living room, lit by three lofty bay windows looking out over the countryside and the sea beyond, is a large theatre-like space divided into two levels separated by four or five steps. The upper area is designed for work with large wooden bookcases and a huge work table while an equally large sofa and five simple white-upholstered rocking chairs are spread across the lower level. Many of the houses furnishings are also made of local stone, faced with glazed blue-patterned tiling. On the southern side of the building, there is a large covered terrace which leads onto a series of interlinked platforms down to the swimming pool. On the northern side, there is also a loggia and patio. The entire building is more carefully finished, detracting somewhat from the originality of Can Lis. But the house is an unequalled study in the relationship between structure and light. Furthermore, it fits perfectly into the surroundings, demonstrating Utzon's gift for adapting buildings to their natural environment.Christian Norberg-Schultz, \\"J√∏rn Utzon og det oprindelige\\" in Martin Keiding and Kim Dirckinck-Holmfeld (ed.), Utzon's own houses, Utzon Library, Copenhagen, Danish Architectural Press, page 69 et seq.Kim Faber, \\"Lin Utzon: ¬ªDet, der er vigtigt, er at ramme rigtigt¬´\\", Politiken, 24 November 2010. Retrieved 29 September 2011. Although the building occupies some 400 or 500 square metres, only about 150 square metres is devoted to actual indoor living space. The house is sparsely furnished. There are no pictures on the walls, just books on the shelves in the various rooms, and the only decoration comes from the glazed blue and black tiles on sections of the walls. Overall, the house gives an impression of timelessness.Tobia Faber, \\"To huse p√• en Middelhavs√∏\\" in Martin Keiding and Kim Dirckinck-Holmfeld (ed.), Utzon's own houses, Utzon Library, Copenhagen, Danish Architectural Press, page 86 et seq.

(Fondazione Cariplo) Cesare Maggi (Rome, 1881 ‚Äì Turin, 1961) was an Italian painter. Biography Born into a family of actors, Maggi embarked on classical studies at his father‚Äôs wish but also took up painting at a very early age, first with the Livornese artist Vittorio Matteo Corcos in 1897 and then with Gaetano Esposito in Naples. His debut in Florence at the Esposizione Annuale della Societ√† di Belle Arti di Firenze in 1898 was followed by a short trip to Paris to catch up with the latest developments. The crucial turning point in Maggi‚Äôs art came in 1889 with the posthumous show of work by Giovanni Segantini held by the Milanese Society of Fine Arts, which prompted a definitive shift to landscape painting of a Divisionist character. After a short stay in the Engadin, he returned to Milan before finally settling in Turin. Commercial collaboration with Alberto Grubicy until 1913 enabled Maggi to establish himself quickly as one of the leading representatives of the second generation of Divisionist painters in Italy. He painted a repertoire of readily comprehensible mountain landscapes focusing primarily on aspects of the visual perception of the reflection of light and colour but lacking the deep spirituality of Segantini‚Äôs work. He took part in the major Italian and European exhibitions and the Venice Biennale devoted an entire room to his work at the Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte of Venice in 1912. After an interlude devoted to portrait painting in the same decade, the artist‚Äôs mature work focused on greater simplification of subject matter, mostly in landscapes. Maggi obtained the chair in painting at the Albertina Academy, Turin, in 1936.

These inhibitors may have therapeutic application in the treatment of various types of cancers. Many c-Met inhibitors are currently in clinical trials. Crizotinib and cabozantinib were the first to be approved by the U.S. FDA. Crizotinib received accelerated approval in 2011 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, while cabozantinib was approved in 2012 for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer and it has also started clinical trials for the treatment of several other types of cancer. c-Met stimulates cell scattering, invasion, protection from apoptosis and angiogenesis. c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which can cause a wide variety of different cancers, such as renal, gastric and small cell lung carcinomas, central nervous system tumours, as well as several sarcomas when its activity is dysregulated. Targeting the ATP binding site of c-Met by small molecules inhibitors is one strategy for inhibition of the tyrosine kinase. History Figure 3. K252a, the first small molecule Met inhibitor to be solved in complex with the unphosphorylated Met kinase domain. Two key hydrogen bonds form between the hinge of Met and the pyrralocarbazole. Early in the 1980s MET was described as the protein product of a transforming oncogene. Figure 1. SU11274, a first generation c-Met inhibitor (indolin-2-one core in red circle). Figure 2. PHA665752, a second-generation c-Met inhibitor. Initial attempts to identify ATP-competitive c-Met inhibitors in 2002 led to the discovery of K252a, a staurosporine-like inhibitor which blocks c-Met. K252a was the first structure to be solved in complex with the unphosphorylated MET kinase domain. It forms two hydrogen bonds between the hinge and pyrralocarbazole subunit. Later, series of more selective c-Met inhibitors were designed, where an indolin-2-one core (encircled in figure 1) was present in several kinase inhibitors. SU-11274 was evolved by substitution at the 5-position of the indolinone and by adding a 3,5-dimethyl pyrrole group, PHA-665752 was evolved ‚Äì a second-generation inhibitor with better potency and activity. Interest in this field has risen rapidly since 2007 and over 70 patent applications had been published in mid-2009. Intensive efforts have been exerted in the pharmaceutical industry following the acceptance of c-Met as a suitable target for cancer therapy. 20 crystal structures with and without ligands have been published and in 2010 nearly a dozen small molecule c-Met inhibitors have been tested clinically.  Introduction  Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a vital element in regulating many intracellular signal transduction pathways. Met tyrosine kinase is the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF). HGF is mostly expressed on epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells, for example smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts). HGF is normally active in wound healing, liver regeneration, embryo and normal mammalian development, organ morphogenesis. c-Met dysregulation can be due to overexpression, gene amplification, mutation, a ligand-dependent auto- or paracrine loop or an untimely activation of RTK. All these factors affect the survival of cells, their proliferation and motility. They also lead to cancers and resistance to therapies which aim to treat them. Patients with aberrant c-Met activity usually have a poor prognosis, aggressive disease, increased metastasis and shortened survival. This is why targeting the HGF/c-MET signalling pathway has been untaken as a treatment for cancer, and several different therapeutic approaches are being clinically tested. A variety of approaches have been used to target c-Met, each focusing on one of the serial steps that regulate c-Met activation by antibodies, peptide agonists, decoy receptors and other biologic inhibitors or small molecules inhibitors.  Structure and function  Figure 4. Schematic structure of some Met inhibitory possibilities: Antibodies and antagonists (such as NK4) bind to the extracellular domain. Met fragments of the extracellular domain can also bind to HGF and act as a decoy Met. Small molecule inhibitors bind to the intracellular Met kinase. Functional domains of Met: P encircled (Phosphate group), S-S (disulfide bond), Sema domain (Semaphorin-like), PSI (Plexins, Semaphorins, Integrins), IPT domain (Immunoglobulin-like, Plexins, Transcription factors) and PTK (Protein Tyrosine Kinase). Figure 5. The topographical features of the Met ATP binding site. A: Tyrosine in the activation loop, B: Hydrophobic sub-pocket C: Central hydrophobic region, D: Hinge region, E: Hydrophobic sub-pocket. The c-Met RTK subfamily is different in structure to many other RTK families: The mature form has an extracellular Œ±-chain (50kDa) and a transmembrane Œ≤-chain (140kDa) that are linked together by a disulfide bond. The beta chain contains the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a tail on the C-terminal which is vital for the docking of substrates and downstream signalling. HGF is the natural high-affinity ligand for Met. Its N-terminal region binds to Met and receptor dimerization as well as autophosphorylation of two tyrosines occur in the activation loop (A-loop) in the kinase domain of Met. Phosphorylation occurs in tyrosines close to the C-terminus, creating a multi-functional docking site which recruits adaptor proteins and leads to downstream signalling. The signaling is mediated by Ras/Mapk, PI3K/Akt, c-Src and STAT3/5 and include cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, altered cytoskeletal function and more. The kinase domain usually consists of a bi-lobed structure, where the lobes are connected with a hinge region, adjacent to the very conserved ATP binding site.  Development  Using information from the co- crystal structure of PHA-66752 and c-Met, the selective inhibitor PF-2341066 was designed. It was undergoing Phase I/II clinical trials in 2010. Changing a series of 4-phenoxyquinoline compounds with an acyl thiourea group led to compounds with c-Met activity, e.g. quinoline. This was a key step in the progress of c-Met inhibitor development in that the acyl binding gives the terminal aryl group the ability to penetrate a deep hydrophobic pocket and so it enhances the potency of the compounds. Alternatives to the acyl thiourea linkage have been found, which have a pyrimidone group, as in AM7. AM7 and SU11274 offered the first proof that relatively selective c-Met inhibitors could be identified and that the inhibition leads to an anti-tumour effect in vivo. When the co-crystal structures of AM7 and SU11274 with c-Met were compared, they were found to be different: SU-11274 binds adjacent to the hinge region with a U-shaped conformation; but AM7 binds to c-Met in an extended conformation which spans the area from the hinge region to the C-helix. It then binds in a hydrophobic pocket. c-Met assumes an inactive, unphosphorylated conformation with AM7, which can bind to both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated conformations of the kinase. Due to these two different types of binding, small molecule Met inhibitors have been divided into two classes; class I (SU-11274-like) and class II (AM7-like). There is however another type of small-molecule inhibitors, which does not fit into either of the two classes; a non-competitive ATP inhibitor that binds in a different way to the other two. The small molecule inhibitors vary in selectivity, are either very specific or have a broad selectivity. They are either ATP competitive or non-competitive.  ATP-competitive small molecule c-Met inhibitors  Even though the two classes are structurally different, they do share some properties: They both bind at the kinase hinge region (although they occupy different parts of the c-Met active site) and they all aim to mimic the purine of ATP. BMS-777607 and PF-02341066 have a 2-amino-pyridine group, AMG-458 has a quinoline group and MK-2461 has a tricyclic aromatic group. = Class I = Class I inhibitors have many different structures, are relatively selective and have a U-shaped conformation and binds to the activation loop of c-Met.  Structure-activity relationship of Class I inhibitors  rightthumb300pxFigure 6. SAR of class I Met inhibitors with various substitution groups. Ar symbolizes an aromatic group (in this figure, from left to right: quinoline, azaindole, benzothiazide, benzyl groups (with various R groups, such as -OH) and methoxyphenyl)). X symbolizes the linker between the core and the aryl group (from left to right: Methyl, difluoro methyl, methoxy, amino and sulfur groups). R1 symbolizes the various groups which were added onto C-7 (from top to bottom: N-linked chlorophenol, N-hydroxyethyl pyrazole and pyrazole). Atoms in positions 1, 5, 8 and 9 in many of the tested analogs were either C or N atoms. A series of triazolotriazines was discovered, which showed great promise as a c-MET inhibitors. Structure activity relationship (SAR) implies the necessity of an aryl group linked to the triazine ring and an appropriate hydrogen bond acceptor (e.g. hydroxyl group) attached to the pendant benzyl ring but it seems like the phenol acts as a hinge binder (with Met1160) and that the triazine interacts with Tyr1230. A number of similar analogues were found and assayed. Structurally similar series of c-Met inhibitors in which a phenolic hinge binding element was linked to an arylamino-triazolopyridazine or aryl- triazolothiapyridazine. One-atom linker was more efficient than a two-atom linker and that substitution at the benzylic position seemed to be tolerated. Compounds with heterocyclic hinge binding elements (quinoline, pyridine, azaindole) linked to fused, nitrogen-dense heteroaromatics (triazolopyridazines, triazolopyrazines and triazolotriazines) have been described. See figure 4 for details.  Examples of Class I inhibitors  JNJ-38877605, which contains a difluoro methyl linker and a bioavailable quinoline group, was undergoing clinical trials of Phase I for advanced and refractory solid tumours in 2010. PF-04217903, an ATP-competitive and exceptionally selective compound, has an N-hydroxyethyl pyrazole group tethered to C-7 of the triazolopyrazine. It was undergoing phase I clinical trials in 2010. Figure 7. MK2461, a unique c-Met inhibitor The SAR of the unique kinase inhibitor scaffold with powerful c-Met inhibitory activity, MK-2461, has been explored. The pyridine nitrogen is necessary for inhibition activity and central ring saturation reduced potency. Planarity of the molecule has proven to be essential for maximum potency. Cyclic ethers balance acceptable cell-based activities and pharmacokinetic characteristics. The following elements are thought to be key in the optimization process: 1) Aryl groups at the 7-position, as if to maximize hydrophobic packing and planarity, 2) The tight SAR upon the addition of a sulfonamide group and 3) The relatively flat SAR of solvent-exposed groups. Often, oncogenic mutations of c-Met cause a resistance to small molecule inhibitors. An MK-2461 analog was therefore tested against a variety of c-Met mutants but proved to be no less potent against them. This gives the molecule a big advantage as a treatment for tumours caused by c-Met dysregulation. MK-2461 was undergoing phase I dose escalation trials in 2010. = Class II = Figure 8. A common scaffold for class II Met inhibitors. Atoms in positions F, E, 6 and 3 in many of the tested analogs were either C, C-F or N groups. The O atom of the amide may be substituted for an S atom. The R groups represent some of the groups that were tested against MET with various substitution groups (Left side from top to bottom: Amide, chlorine, aryl oxy qinoline groups, methoxy phenyl and pyrrolotriazines with a terminal amine group. Right side from top to bottom: Fluorophenyl malonamide with a cyclopropyl group, hydroxy methyl phenyl pyrazolone, ethoxy fluorophenyl pyridone and fluorophenyl oxalamide).A: The R3 group lodges into the hydrophobic pocket of c-MET, B: The pyridine group binds to the hinge region and C: The R2 group usually binds to the ribose pocket where the ribose of ATP normally binds. Class II inhibitors are usually not as selective as those of class I. Urea groups are also a common feature of class II inhibitors, either in cyclic or acyclic forms. Class II of inhibitors contains a number of different molecules, a common scaffold of which can be seen in figure 4.  Structure-activity relationship of Class II inhibitors  Series of quinoline c-Met inhibitors with an acylthiourea linkage have been explored. Multiple series of analogs have been found with alternative hinge binding groups (e.g. replacement of the quinoline group), replacement of the thiourea linkage (e.g. malonamide, oxalamide, pyrazolones) and constraining of the acyclic acylthiourea structure fragment with various aromatic heterocycles. Further refinement included the blocking of the p-position of the pendant phenyl ring with a fluorine atom. Example of interactions between c-Met and a small molecules (marked in a red circle) of class II are as follows: The scaffold of c-Met lodges into the ATP pocket by three key hydrogen bonds, the terminal amine interacts with the ribose pocket (of ATP), the terminal 4-fluorophenyl group is oriented in a hydrophobic pocket and pyrrolotriazine plays the role of the hinge-binding group.  Examples of Class II inhibitors  In phase II clinical trials, GSK 1363089 (XL880, foretinib) was well tolerated. It led to slight regressions or stable disease in patients with papillary renal carcinoma and poorly differentiated gastric cancer. AMG 458 is a potent small molecule c-MET inhibitor which proved to have more than a 100-fold selectivity for c-MET across a panel of 55 kinases. Also, AMG 458 was 100% bioavailable across species and the intrinsic half-life increased with higher mammals.  ATP non-competitive small molecule c-Met inhibitors  = Tivantinib = Tivantinib (ARQ197), a c-Met inhibitor Tivantinib (ARQ197) is a selective, orally bioavailable, clinically advanced low-molecular weight and well-tolerated c-MET inhibitor, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer patients. ARQ197 is a non-ATP competitive c-MET autophosphorylation inhibitor with a high selectivity for the unphosphorylated conformation of the kinase. Tivantinib cuts off the interactions between the key catalytic residues. The structure of tivantinib in complex with the c-Met kinase domain shows that the inhibitor binds a conformation that is distinct from published kinase structures. Tivantinib strongly inhibits c-Met autoactivation by selectively targeting the inactive form of the kinase between the N- and C- lobes and occupies the ATP binding site. Clinical trials and regulatory approvals = Current status as of 2010= Since the discovery of Met and HGF, much research interest has focused on their roles in cancer. The Met pathway is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in human cancer. Increased understanding of the binding modes and structural design brings us closer to the use of other protein interactions and binding pockets, creating inhibitors with alternative structures and optimized profiles. over a dozen Met pathway inhibitors, with varying kinase selectivity profiles ranging from highly selective to multi- targeted, have been studied in the clinic and good progress has been achieved (See table 1). (e.g. XL184(Cabozantinib), XL880, ARQ197 ) The use of c-Met inhibitors with other therapeutic agents could be crucial for overcoming potential resistance as well as for improving overall clinical benefit. Met pathway inhibitors might be used in combination with other treatments, including chemo-, radio- or immunotherapy as well as different Met pathway inhibitor, f.ex. in with HGF and Met biological antagonists or antibodies against HGF and MET. Still, the risk of accumulated toxicity and interactions with other drugs remains. =Since 2010= In 2011 PF-02341066 (now named crizotinib) was approved by US FDA for some non-small cell lung cancers. In 2012 XL184/cabozantinib gained FDA approval to treat medullary thyroid cancer, and in 2016 it gained FDA and EU approval to treat kidney cancer. =Research on other inhibitors= Tepotinib, (MSC 2156119J),Tepotinib With Gefitinib in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (INSIGHT) has reported phase II clinical trial results on lung cancer.Phase II trial of the c-Met inhibitor tepotinib in advanced lung adenocarcinoma with MET exon 14 skipping mutations. 2017 See also *Mesenchymal-epithelial transition *Hepatocyte growth factor *K252a *Epithelial-mesenchymal transition *c-Met External links *Experimental Cancer Therapeutics Targeting the Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Met Signaling Pathway References Category:Cancer research Category:Protein kinase inhibitors ","title":"C-Met inhibitor"},{"id":"33238916","text":"Somalia‚ÄìYemen relations are bilateral relations between Somalia and Yemen.

History =Ancient= Relations between the modern-day territories of Somalia and Yemen stretch back to antiquity. A number of both Yemeni and Somali clans trace descent to the latter region. The 1st century CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, among other documents, also reports early commercial exchanges between traders inhabiting city-states on the northern Somalia littoral with Himyarite and Sabaean merchants. Numerous artefacts dating from this period have been uncovered in Somalia, such as at the Damo site in the northeastern Puntland region.Neville Chittick, An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition, (1975), pp.117-133. In the Middle Ages, the Somali Sultanates often recruited troops from Yemen's Hadhramaut region. During the medieval period, disgruntled Yemenis from the Hadhrami wars additionally sought and received asylum in Somali Kingdoms like Ajuran Empire and Adal Sultanate. =Medieval= Relationships between Somalis and Yemenis in medieval periods differed from the coastal Somalis who had good trade relations with Yemenis, and the interior Somalis who viewed Arabs in general in a negative light. Some western travellers reported on these accounts a follows: =Contemporary= Yemen in turn unconditionally opened its borders to Somali nationals following the outbreak of the civil war in Somalia in the early 1990s. Over the ensuing interim period, the Yemeni authorities maintained relations with Somalia's newly established Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government. In September 2012, at a mini-summit on Somalia held during the 67th session of the UN General Assembly, Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, on behalf of President of Yemen Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi, welcomed the Somali government's completion of its scheduled shift from a transitional administration to a permanent one and urged the international community to continue its support for the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction efforts in Somalia.\\"Yemen : President Hadi calls on int‚Äôl community to bear its responsibilities towards Somalia\\" The Federal Government of Somalia was later established on August 20, 2012, representing the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the conflict. The following month, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was elected as the new government's first President. The election was welcomed by the Yemeni authorities, who re-affirmed Yemen's continued support for Somalia's government, its territorial integrity and sovereignty. During the Houthi insurgency in 2015 in Yemen, Foreign Minister of Somalia Abdisalam Omer likewise reiterated his administration's support for the legitimacy of Yemen's incumbent government led by President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Trade and agreements In May 2014, the Somali State Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Bur‚Äôi Mohamed Hamza met with the Yemeni Ambassador to Somalia Fu'ad Mohamed Al Zorqah to discuss bilateral cooperation. The conference was held at the Foreign Affairs Ministry compound in Mogadishu and touched on a number of issues, including the launching of a direct flight between Mogadishu and Sana'a. Operated by Al Saeda Airlines, it is the first air route directly linking both capitals since the collapse of Somalia's former central government in 1991. In June 2014, the Fisheries Minister of the Puntland State of Somalia Hasan Mahmoud announced that the Somali and Yemeni governments are slated to sign a Memorandum of Understanding to regulate fishing within Somalia's territorial waters by Yemeni fishermen. The Puntland and Yemeni Fisheries ministries are also scheduled to hold talks on bilateral cooperation, with the aim of preserving and effectively exploiting marine resources.

Biography Born into a Milanese family of ancient and noble lineage, Carlo Mancini grew up in a liberal cultural climate and mixed with some of the leading figures in Milan‚Äôs musical world. Regular guests in the family villa at Merate, included: Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Giuseppe Verdi as well as Arrigo Boito, with whom he formed a close friendship.Verdi, F. and Busch, H., Verdi's Falstaff in Letters and Contemporary Reviews, Indiana University Press, 1997, p. 576 It was probably the landscape painter Rinaldo Barbiano di Belgioso, an uncle on his mother‚Äôs side, who first interested him in painting. Given that the only evidence of his studies under the guidance of Giuseppe Bisi, then holder of the chair in landscape at the Brera Academy, is an end-of-course exam work of the mid-1850s (1857) and that his name appears on no official academic documents, it has recently been suggested that his pictorial apprenticeship took place outside the institution. At the culmination of his studies, in 1857, he exhibited Winter Morning at the International Exhibition in Paris.Morell, J.R., Bradshaw's Hand-Book to the Paris International Exhibition of 1867, 1867, p.85 A trip in Brittany and Normandy led to early contact with English landscape painting and steered Mancini‚Äôs artistic interests towards faithful depiction from life but attenuated by late-Romantic overtones in the handling of light. Until he stopped showing work at exhibitions in 1875, he focused on rural subjects, mostly drawn from the countryside in Brianza and from memories of his youthful stay in Normandy, which were favourably reviewed by critics and won him some marks of official recognition.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti, by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 274. In his later career, he visited Egypt, Arabia, India, Burma and China and brought home hundreds of sketches which he kept in a locked, iron chest until his death. In 1929, these sketches were donated to the Galleria Moderna d'Arte. From the 1870s, following his trip to the Far-East and Middle- East, his work included more Oriental subject matter.Country Life, Limited, 1989, p. 226  Work Mancini worked primarily in watercolour, however he occasionally worked in oil.

Biography In 1844 Francesco Mancini became a student at the Naples Royal Institute of Fine Arts, where he studied drawing and attended Gabriele Smargiassi‚Äôs course on landscape from 1846. At the end of the decade he moved on from his academic training and devoted himself to painting from life, during numerous travels in the regions of southern Italy. He also tried his hand at history painting and presented scenes from the struggle for national liberation in Florence at the Esposizione Nazionale di Firenze of 1861. A leading figure in Neapolitan cultural life, Mancini became a member of the Societ√† Promotrice di Belle Arti there in 1862 and was a regular participant in its exhibitions. In 1877 he took up a teaching post at the city's Academy and was one of the founders of the Circolo Artistico Napoletano in 1888. His participation in the major national exhibitions in Italian cities included those in Turin (1880 and 1884) and in Milan (1881). His landscapes inspired by the countryside and customs of the Abruzzi, Apulia, and Calabria regions were accompanied in this period by his more fashionable scenes of city life painted during frequent stays in Paris and London, which found great favour with the collectors of the time. His works found buyers in Europe and America, and he was knighted into the Order of the Crown of Italy. He exhibited in 1877 at Naples: La strada ferrata (property of the Conte de la Feld); four canvases depicting Torchio; and one titled a rupe. In 1880 at Turin, he exhibited: Seascape of Capri; Seascape of Casamicciola; Capo Pescara; Seascape of Naples; Approdo delle barche di Sorrento; Seascape of Pozzuoli; and Veduta dei tre Monti. in 1881 at Milan, he displayed: a landscape, Nel bosco, and Mercato a Popoli negli Abruzzi. At Rome, in 1883: A Zingara (A Gypsy Woman); Dopo il pascolo (also exhibited in 1884 at Turin); Sport; and Dopo la vendemmia. In 1887 at Venezia, in 1887: Amalfi; Pompei; San Marco, and Cava dei Tirreni. Other works are: Veduta di Popoli; Seascape of Ischia; Alpine Locale; Mattino estivo; Ritorno dalla pena; and Tramonto.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti, by Angelo de Gubernatis.

In the broadest definition, a contract is an agreement two or more parties enter into with the serious intention of creating a legal obligation. Contract law provides a legal framework within which persons can transact business and exchange resources, secure in the knowledge that the law will uphold their agreements and, if necessary, enforce them. The law of contract underpins private enterprise in South Africa and regulates it in the interest of fair dealing.  Nature  A contract is an agreement entered into by two or more parties with the serious intention of creating a legal obligation; i.e. an obligationary agreement. A contract in South Africa is classified as an obligationary agreement‚Äîit creates enforceable obligations‚Äîand ought therefore to be distinguished from liberatory agreements (whereby obligations are discharged or extinguished; e.g. release, novation), real agreements (whereby rights are transferred; e.g. cession, conveyance), and family law agreements.Du Plessis, et al. p.4.This classifactory scheme for agreements comes from Afrikaans legal writing which in turn comes from Dutch. In Afrikaans: verbintenisskeppende ooreenkoms, skulddelgende ooreenkoms, saaklike ooreenkoms, and huweliksooreenkoms. = Requirements = For a contract to be considered valid and binding in South Africa, the following requirements must be met: # There must be consensus ad idem between the contracting parties. # The parties must have seriously intended the agreement to result in terms which can be enforced. # The parties must have the capacity to contract. # The agreement must have certain and definite terms. # The necessary formalities must be observed. # The agreement must be lawful.Gibson 2003:10 # The contractual obligations must be possible of performance. # The content of the agreement must be certain. The requirements are discussed in greater detail below. = Characteristics = A contract has certain characteristic features: * It is a bilateral juristic act. The law attaches the consequences intended by the parties. The parties should be aware that they are creating a legal obligation between them. * It can be unilateral, i.e. one party has a duty to perform, or bilateral or multilateral, i.e. both parties have a duty to perform.Van Huyssteen & Maxwell, Contract Law in South Africa, ¬ß 50. * It is an obligationary agreement. It entails undertakings or forbearances, on one or both sides, to tender certain performances: that is, to give (dare), to do (facere) or not to do (non facere). Alternatively, it may be a warranty that a certain state of affairs exists. * If bilateral, it is usually synallagmatic (or reciprocal), meaning that one party's performance is promised in exchange for the performance of the other party. The modern concept of contract is generalised so that an agreement does not have to conform to a specific type to be enforced, but contracting parties are required to conduct their relationship in good faith (bona fides). = Contract and the law of obligations = Contract law forms part of the law of obligations. An obligation is a legal bond (vinculum iuris) between two or more parties, obliging the obligor (the ‚Äòdebtor‚Äô) to give, do or refrain from doing something to or for the obligee (the ‚Äòcreditor‚Äô). The right created by an obligation is personal, a ius in personam, as opposed to a real right (ius in re). The words ‚Äòcreditor‚Äô and ‚Äòdebtor‚Äô apply not only in respect of a claim for money, but to a claim for anything else that is owed‚Äîwhether unconditionally, conditionally, or in the future. If an obligation is enforceable by action in a court, it is a civil obligation, rather than the less common and unenforceable natural obligation. ‚ÄòThe most important point‚Äô, in discussing the legal effect of contracts, is ‚Äòthe duty of the parties to perform their obligations‚Äô.Hutchison & Du Bois, ‚ÄúContracts‚Äù, 790.  Contract and delict  The primary sources of obligations are contract and delict, the latter being wrongful and blameworthy conduct that harms a person. There is a close similarity between a breach of contract and a delict, in that both are civil wrongs and may give rise to a duty to pay damages as compensation. It is unsurprising, then, that certain conduct may constitute both a breach of contract and a delict (as when, in Van Wyk v Lewis,Case: 1924 AD 438. a surgeon negligently left a cotton swab inside a patient's body), in which case there is concurrent liability, permitting the plaintiff to sue on either basis.  Contract and quasi-contract  Another source of obligations is quasi-contract, in which rights and duties arise from something other than consensus. One example is unjustified enrichment, which occurs when wealth shifts from one person's patrimony to another's without legal justification. Where a party transfers an asset to another in performance of a contract that is for some reason invalid, the shift of wealth is without good cause (or sine causa), and an enrichment action for the restitution of the asset lies. The other main types of quasi-contract are negotiorum gestio and indebiti solutio. = Contract and the law of property = Many commercial transactions involve both the law of obligations and the law of property, and so have both proprietary and obligationary or contractual elements. A contract of sale, for instance, obliges the seller to deliver the thing being sold to the buyer. As such, it is the causa, or underlying reason, for the subsequent transfer of ownership. It does not, however, effect the transfer, which is accomplished by the real agreement (the concurring intentions of the parties to make and receive transfer of ownership). If the underlying contract is invalid, ownership nonetheless passes, because South African law adheres to the abstract rather than the causal system of transfer. The transferor, however, generally has the option of a restitutionary action to recover the property. = Historical development of contract =  Roman law  Roman law had a closed system of contracts which recognised only four types (e.g. contracts consensu, re, verbis and litteris) that were binding only if ‚Äòclothed‚Äô in special forms and formulas;Harold J. Berman, Law and Revolution, II: The Impact of the Protestant Reformations on the Western Legal Tradition (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard UP, 2003), 157. in other words, Roman law had ‚Äòa law of contracts, rather than of contract‚Äô. This distinguishes it from the modern practice of regarding any obligationary agreement meeting certain general requirements as an enforceable contract. Only for contracts consensu (e.g. sale, lease, partnership and mandate) was mutual assent (consensus ad idem) ‚Äòclothed‚Äô in solemnities sufficient to make the agreement enforceable. Any agreement that did not rigidly conform to the four types was referred to as a nudum pactum and was not actionable unless there had been part performance. The development of contracts consensu was prompted by the commercial needs of the growing Roman state, but Roman law never reached the point of enforcing all serious and deliberate agreements as contracts.Du Plessis, et al. p.12.  Roman-Dutch law  The Roman-Dutch law of contract, on the other hand, is based on canon and natural laws. Adopting the canonist position, all contracts were said to be an exchange of promises that were consensual and bonae fidei, that is, based simply on mutual assent and good faith. Taking the Christian view that it is a sin to break one's promise, canon lawyers developed the pacta sunt servanda principle under which all serious agreements ought to be enforced, regardless of whether there had been compliance with strict formalities as prescribed by secular law. Under the causa theory, for the contract to be binding it had to have a iusta causa, or lawful motive in line with Christian moral imperatives, arising not only from a lawful or just right, title, or cause of action, but also from love and affection, moral consideration, or past services.Fellmeth & Horwitz, Guide to Latin in International Law (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2011) A nudum pactum was redefined as any agreement unenforceable for lack of causa. All of these principles were applied uniformly through European ecclesiastical courts. In keeping with Enlightenment values, natural lawyers stripped away the Christian morality from contract law. They redefined a contract as a concurrence of wills, and each party's ‚Äòpromise‚Äô was now seen as a declaration of will devoid of moral obligation (will theory). In place of iusta causa developed a general principle of binding force under which any valid contract was both binding and actionable. Canonist substantive fairness shifted to procedural fairness, so good faith and mutual assent were retained as requirements, but just price and laesio enormis were not. Under English rule, public policy was substituted for bonos mores. In the late 19th century and influenced by English law and Lord Henry de Villiers CJ, the courts reinterpreted iusta causa as valuable consideration and necessary for a valid contract.  Causa and consideration  Initially under Roman-Dutch law the broad notion of iusta causa was necessary to create obligations; therefore, for a contract to be enforceable, it had to be shown to be based on a causa.Reinhard Zimmermann (1996), The Law of Obligations: Roman Foundations of the Civilian Tradition, Oxford University Press However, by the 17th century and under the influence of the usus modernus pandectarum, the general principle of binding force had become the rule in Holland.Lynn Berat, ‚ÄúSouth African Contract Law: The Need for a Concept of Unconscionability‚Äù, Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review 14, no. 3 (1992): 512. By contrast, under English law, a contract required not causa but rather valuable consideration (ex titulo oneroso). This led to differing practice between, on the one hand, Roman-Dutch law jurisdictions applying either iusta causa or the general principle of binding force, and, on the other, English law jurisdictions applying the doctrine of consideration. During English rule, this difference gave rise to a celebrated dispute in early South African law.See Zimmermann & Visser 166-173. In the late 19th century, under the general influence of English law ‚Äòand the particular dominating influence of Lord Henry de Villiers CJ‚Äô, the courts reinterpreted iusta causa to be valuable consideration and necessary for a valid contract.Alexander v Perry (1874) 4 Buch 59. This was met with fierce resistance by northern jurists like John Gilbert Kotz√©, and later rejected outright by the Transvaal Supreme Court in Rood v Wallach (1904) which applied a general principle of binding force.Case: 1904 TS 187, 209. De Villiers, however, refused to concede the point, so that the dispute continued until 1919, almost 50 years after it began, it was settled by the Appellate Division of the South African Supreme Court in the famous case of Conradie v Rossouw,Case: 1919 AD 279 at 317. where the court took the Transvaal view that a binding contract may be constituted by any serious and deliberate agreement made with the intention of creating a legal obligation, and in so doing, simultaneously abolished the iusta causa and consideration doctrines. It seems now to be clear that a causa, be it onerous (ex titulo oneroso) or gratuitous (ex causa lucrativa), is not a separate requirement in the South African law of contract.Du Plessis, et al. p.13. ‚ÄòThat a contract, in order to be valid, must have been seriously intended by the parties [as well as the other obvious elements such as lawful and performable], is a matter of course ... [and] does not need causa as an independent element‚Äô.  Basis  = Actual subjective agreement = Genuine agreement (or consensus) as the basis for contractual obligations, presupposes an actual mutual assent of the parties. Subjective consensus of this nature exists when all the parties involved: * Seriously intend to contract (animus contrahendi); * Are of one mind (or ad idem) as to the contract's material terms; and * Are conscious of the fact that their minds have met.Du Plessis, et al. p.14. = Objective agreement = Where there is a divergence between the true intention and the expressed or perceived intention of the parties, the question of whether or not a legal system will uphold a contract depends on its approach to contract: Is it subjective (focused on an actual consensus), or is it apparent or objective (focused on the external appearance of agreement)?Du Plessis, et al. p.15.  Theories of contract  = Will theory = The will theory of contract postulates an extremely subjective approach to contract, whereby consensus is the only basis for contractual liability. The upshot is that, if there is no genuine concurrence of wills, there can be no contract. It is generally agreed, though, that unqualified adherence to this theory would produce results both unfair and economically disastrous. = Declaration theory = The declaration theory, in contrast, stipulates that the only important consideration is the external manifestation of the parties‚Äô wills. The true basis of contract, then, is to be found in the concurring declarations of the parties, not in what they actually think or intend.Du Plessis, et al. p.15-16. This extremely objective approach has also generally been found to be unacceptable in practice, unless it is qualified.De Wet & Van Wyk 12-13.Du Plessis, et al. p.16. = Reliance theory = In terms of the compromise reliance theory, the basis of contract is to be found in a reasonable belief, induced by the conduct of the other party, in the existence of consensus. This protects a party's reasonable expectation of a contract. The reliance theory should be seen as a supplement to the will theory, affording an alternative basis for contract in circumstances where the minds of the parties have not truly met. = South African approach = South African law, with its Roman- Dutch roots, but strongly influenced by English law, has vacillated between a subjective and an objective approach to contract.Du Plessis, et al. p.17, 18. It is now clear, however, that the subjective will theory is the point of departure; in cases of dissensus, the shortcomings of that theory are corrected by an application of the reliance theory.Du Plessis, et al. p.20. = Proving the existence of a contract = The onus of proving the existence of a contract rests on the person who alleges that the contract exists.  Cornerstones  Fundamental concepts in the law of contract include: * Freedom of contract * Sanctity of contract * Good faith * Privity of contractDu Plessis, et al. p.21. There is mounting competition between them. As Hutchison and Pretorius (2009) note, ‚ÄòThe law of contract is currently undergoing a process of quite profound change and renewal as it adapts to meet the demands of the new constitutional era in South Africa‚Äô.Du Plessis, et al. p.xxii. Freedom of contract especially is under pressure, as the courts are increasingly willing to use public policy as grounds to strike down unfair contracts. The legislature, too, is willing to intervene in private contracts in the interests of fairness, most notably with the National Credit ActAct 34 of 2005. and the Consumer Protection Act.Act 68 of 2008. The latter prohibits certain terms or conditions outright, with the result that they are void to the extent of non-compliance. Where terms are not prohibited outright, they are subject to a requirement of fairness and reasonableness. All law, including the common law of contract, is subject to constitutional control. The Constitution therefore exerts a strong if indirect influence on the law of contract: ‚ÄòThe principles of administrative justice frame the contractual relationship, it has been said, and the Constitution requires that all administrative action must be lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair‚Äô.Du Plessis, et al. p.6.Hoexter, Cora. ‚ÄúContracts in Administrative Law: Life after Formalism.‚Äù South African Law Journal CXXI (2004): 595-618.Government of the Republic of South Africa v Thabiso Chemicals (Pty) Ltd 2009 (1) SA 163 (SCA) 168H. To what extent the Constitution can be invoked directly to challenge the validity of a contractual provision between private parties is a contentious question. The Constitutional Court appears to prefer an indirect application of the Constitution between private parties: an approach that tests the validity of a private contractual provision against the requirements of public policy, but also recognises that public policy is now determined with reference to the fundamental values embodied in the Constitution, and particularly in the Bill of Rights. The courts have shown a willingness to intervene if a party exercises a contractual power in a manner that fails to respect the constitutional rights of another party, and may even, in appropriate circumstances, be willing to compel one party to contract with another on constitutional grounds.  Offer and acceptance  The rules of offer and acceptance constitute a useful, but not essential, analytical tool in understanding the formation of contracts. An offer is a statement of intent in which the offeror expresses (to the person to whom the offer is conveyed) the performance and the terms to which he is prepared to bind himself. Being a unilateral declaration, an offer does not in itself give rise to a binding obligation. For an offer to be valid, it must be: * Definite * Complete * Clear and certain * Compliant with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Act, which, among other things: ** Prohibits negative option billing and bait marketing ** Provides for a cooling-off period for certain contracts ** Regulates catalogue marketing An offer is usually directed at a definite person or persons, but it may also be directed at undefined persons. An advertisement does not generally constitute an offer; it qualifies merely as an invitation to do business, although a promise of reward is a form of advertisement that does constitute an offer. The status in this regard of proposals and tenders is contingent on the intention of the parties, which is in turn determined by the circumstances of each individual case. At a simple auction, not subject to conditions, the bidder is construed as making the offer. At an auction with reserve, the potential purchaser is construed as making the offer; at an auction without reserve, the auctioneer is construed as making the offer. An auction subject to conditions is construed as two potential contracts: The first binds the parties to the auction conditions, while the second constitutes the substantive contract of sale. An offer lapses if: * The offeree rejects the offer. * The offeror revokes the offer. * Either party dies. * The period prescribed by the offeror expires, or‚Äîin the absence of a prescribed period‚Äîa reasonable amount of time has elapsed. An acceptance is an expression of intent by the offeree, signifying agreement to the offer. For an acceptance to be valid, it must be: * Unconditional * Unequivocal * Consciously accepted by the person to whom it was addressed * Compliant with any formalities set by law or the offeror When parties contract at a distance, questions arise as to when and where acceptance takes place. The general rule in South African law follows the information theory, which requires actual and conscious agreement between the contracting parties, such that agreement is established only when the offeror knows about the offeree's acceptance. The place or venue of the formation of the contract is generally where the acceptance is brought to the offeror's notice. Exceptions to the information theory include cases where there has been an express or tacit waiver of the right to notification. Another exeception is the postal contract, which is governed by the expedition theory, according to which the contract comes into being as soon as the offeree has posted the letter of acceptance. Contracts concluded by telephone are governed by the information theory, but contracts entered into by means of email or through other means of electronic communication are governed by the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act.Act 25 of 2002. Parties involved in negotiating a contract may generally terminate the process as they wish. = Pacta de contrahendo = A pactum de contrahendo is a contract aimed at concluding another contract. Examples include the option contract (in terms of which the grantor's right to revoke his offer is restricted) and the preference contract (whereby the grantor gives a preferential right to conclude a specific contract should he decide to conclude this contract). An option contract constitutes two offers: a substantive offer and an undertaking or option to keep the offer open. If the option holder accepts the first offer by exercising the option, the main contract is created. An option contract is irrevocable. (Breach invokes remedies such as an interdict to enforce the contract and damages to place the option holder in the position that he would have occupied had the option been honoured.) It is terminated through the: * Effluxion of time (prescribed or reasonable) * Death of the grantor or grantee * Rejection of the offer by the grantee * Lapse of the right by any other means in law Options may be ceded if such is the grantor's intention. The cession of an option need not be in writing; it may be made orally and without formalities‚Äîunless the substantive contract is required to comply, for instance, with the prerequisite that a sale of immovable property be in writing.Alienation of Land Act 68 of 1981, s 2(1). Because the exercise of an option to purchase immovable property is usually by acceptance of the substantive offer, both the option and the substantive offer must be in writing. A right of pre-emption is a type of preferential right ‚Äòto purchase at a fixed price or at a price at which the grantor is prepared to sell‚Äô.Tjakie Naud√©, ‚ÄúWhich Transactions Trigger a Right of First Refusal or Preferential Right to Contract?‚Äù, p. 461: n4 . Retrieved 30 Jun 2014. It is granted by a prospective seller to a prospective purchaser to give the purchaser right of first refusal if the prospective seller should decide to sell. A pre-emption right must comply with all the requirements for contracts in general. The capacity of the pre-emption grantor to alienate the thing in question is restricted. If the grantor breaches his undertaking to offer the thing to the holder, the holder's remedy is an interdict preventing alienation to a third party. It is uncertain, though, whether a claim by the holder for specific performance would be successful.  Mistake  Whereas a concurrence of wills between the parties is usually regarded as the primary basis of contractual liability (will theory), mistake (error) in contract refers to a situation in which a contracting party acts under a misapprehension, causing disagreement (dissensus) between the parties. The courts tend to categorise a mistake as one of unilateral, mutual or common: * Unilateral mistake occurs where only one of the parties is mistaken, while the other party is aware of the mistake. * Mutual mistake refers to a situation in which both parties are mistaken about each other's intention and are thus at cross-purposes. * Common mistake differs fundamentally from unilateral or mutual mistake in that it does not lead to dissensus but nonetheless results in a contract's being void on the basis of an incorrect underlying supposition. A mistake must have influenced a party's decision to conclude a contract to be relevant. A crucial distinction in the classification of mistake is between material and non-material mistakes: * A material mistake is an error that vitiates or negates actual consensus between the parties and, to this end, must relate to or exclude an element of consensus. * A non-material mistake does not exclude actual agreement between the parties because it does not relate to an element of consensus. To enter into a contract, the parties must: # Have a serious intention to contract (animus contrahendi); # Have a concurrence of wills as to the material aspects of the contract (consensus ad idem); and # Be conscious of their agreement. If the parties are in disagreement about one or more of these elements, there is a material mistake. Mistakes have historically been categorised according to type. The materiality of a mistake has been determined on the basis of the type of mistake in question: * An error in corpore is a mistake that concerns the contract's subject matter or object of performance, and is regarded as material. * An error in negotio is a mistake regarding the nature of the contract and is regarded as material. * An error in persona is a mistake regarding the identity of the other party to the contract. The courts only regard this as a material mistake if the identity of a party is of vital importance to the mistaken party. * An error in substantia is a mistake regarding an attribute or characteristic of the contract's subject matter, and is generally not regarded as material. * Mistake as to the motive for entering into a contract is not regarded as material. * An error iuris is a mistake of law and is not regarded as material if it relates to motive. A denial of contractual liability in all instances where the parties are not in agreement could result in undue hardship for a party who has incurred expense in reasonable reliance on the existence of a contract, and would, furthermore, greatly affect the general reliability of contractual commitments. The courts have alternated between qualifying the subjective and objective bases of contract to solve this problem: * The subjective approach, as encapsulated in the will theory, has been qualified by the doctrine of estoppel and its close relative, the doctrine of quasi-mutual assent or direct reliance theory. * The declaration theory represents the objective approach as corrected by the iustus error doctrine, which is usually regarded as an indirect application of the reliance theory. In the case of estoppel, a party (the estoppel raiser) who relies reasonably on a misrepresentation by the other party (the estoppel denier), and acts thereon to his own detriment, may hold the estoppel denier to his misrepresentation; that means, the estoppel raiser may prevent the estoppel denier from relying on the true state of affairs. A successful plea of estoppel has the effect that the misrepresented facts are upheld as if they were correct. A fictional contract, in other words, will be recognised. The reliance theory requires a reasonable belief on the part of one party (the contract asserter), induced by the other party (the contract denier), that the latter had assented to the contract in question. This theory is similar to estoppel, but has the advantage of giving rise to an actual contract. The declaration theory, on the other hand, grounds contractual liability purely on concurring and objective declarations of will. Inner will or actual intention is irrelevant. On an application of the iustus error approach, where there is an ostensible agreement between the parties, the contract denier bears the onus of proving that his mistake is both material and reasonable in order to be absolved from liability in terms of the apparent contract: * A mistake is reasonable if it is caused by a positive misrepresentation on the part of the contract asserter. * A misrepresentation by omission is only a reasonable mistake if a party has remained silent, where in law he ought to have spoken out to remove the other party's misunderstanding. * There is some authority to the effect that a mistake is excusable if the contract denier is not to blame for the mistake, in that he behaved as a reasonable person in the circumstances would have done, and if he acted without negligence. * An error is reasonable where the contract denier did not cause a reasonable belief in the contract asserter that he had assented to the agreement in question. The courts, as noted earlier, have reconciled the subjective and objective approaches by regarding the iustus error approach as an indirect application of the reliance theory. The reliance theory, then, is effectively the common denominator between the will and declaration theories. It moderates the strict application of each theory either directly (as with the doctrine of quasi- mutual assent in the case of the will theory), or indirectly (as with the iustus error doctrine in the case of the declaration theory). A common mistake differs from a unilateral or a mutual mistake in that it does not lead to dissensus, but nonetheless results in a contract's being void: Both parties make the same mistake, with the important proviso that the mistake does not relate to the intention of either party; in fact, the parties completely agree, but are both mistaken about some underlying and fundamental fact relating to the past or present. For a common error to have an effect on a contract, it must qualify as a term of the contract, either expressly or tacitly, by implication. A legal instrument that incorrectly records the contract between two parties may be rectified to conform to the common intention. In such a case, there is consensus ad idem; what is rectified is not the contract itself as a juristic act (negotium), but rather the instrument (instrumentum) in question, because it does not embody what the parties intended to be the content of their agreement.  Improperly-obtained consensus  Where a person enters into a contract on the strength of a misrepresentation made to him, or as a result of duress or undue influence by the other party, the agreement is nevertheless valid because there is no dissensus. Since the consensus was improperly obtained, however, the contract is voidable at the instance of the innocent party. The remedy used to set aside a voidable contract is rescission coupled with restitution (known as restitutio in integrum), and is available as both an action and a defence. Of course, the innocent party may also elect to uphold the contract. The conduct of the party who induces a contract by improper means frequently constitutes a delict. In such a case, the innocent party may recover damages in respect of any financial loss suffered as a result of the delict, irrespective of whether he elects to affirm or rescind the contract. Despite the contractual context, the damages are delictual in character and are assessed according to the party's negative interest. South African law recognises the following grounds for setting aside a contract: * Misrepresentation * Duress * Undue influence * Commercial bribery It seems likely, but is not yet certain, that further grounds will be recognised in future, in circumstances where a party's consent to a contract has been improperly obtained. A misrepresentation is a false statement of past or present fact, not law or opinion, made by one party to another, before or at the time of the contract, concerning some matter or circumstance relating to it. Misrepresentations are classified as being fraudulent, negligent or innocent. Misrepresentations must be distinguished from: * Warranties and contractual terms * Opinions, predictions and statements of law * Puffery (general laudation or simplex commendatio) * Dicta et promissa or material statements by the seller to the buyer during negotiations, bear on the quality of the thing sold, but go beyond puffery, and give rise to the aedilitian remedies (the actio redhibitoria and the actio quanti minoris) if proven unfounded. Misrepresentation and mistake are distinct legal concepts in the law of contract; they also give rise to distinct remedies. Mistake presupposes an absence of consensus and renders the contract void ab initio, whereas a contract induced by a misrepresentation is valid but voidable. Irrespective of whether the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, negligently or innocently, a party is entitled to restitutio in integrum if the misrepresentation * Was made by the other party * Was made with the intention of inducing a contract * In fact induced the contract * Was material There are two recognised types of contract-inducing fraud, namely dolus dans locum in contractui and dolus incidens in contractum. If, but for the fraud, the contract would not have been concluded at all, it is dolus dans; if there would still have been a contract, but on different terms, it is dolus incidens. Although this point has not yet been settled, dolus incidens probably gives a right only to damages, not to rescission of the contract; this is likely also to apply to an ‚Äòincidental‚Äô misrepresentation made without fraud. Whether the contract is set aside or upheld, the represent may claim damages for any financial loss that he has suffered as a result of the misrepresentation. It makes a difference, though, whether the misrepresentation was made fraudulently, negligently or innocently. Since Ancient Roman times, it has been recognised that fraud is a delict, and that fraudulent misrepresentation accordingly gives rise to a claim for delictual damages. Only very recently was it decided that the same applies to a negligent misrepresentation. These damages, being delictual in character, are measured according to the plaintiff's negative interest and include compensation for consequential losses. In the case of an innocent misrepresentation, there can be no claim for delictual damages, since the misrepresentation was made without fault; nor a claim for contractual damages, since there is no breach of contract‚Äîunless, that is, the representation was warranted to be true. Where the innocent misrepresentation amounts to a dictum et promissum, however, the purchaser may claim a reduction of the price under the actio quanti minoris: a limited form of relief, because not compensating for consequential losses caused by the misrepresentation. A misrepresentation may be made by words or conduct or even silence. This last occurs when a party fails to disclose a material fact in circumstances where there is a legal duty to do so. In the past, the law recognised such a duty to speak in only a limited number of exceptional cases‚Äîwhere, for example, there is a special relationship of trust and confidence between the parties, as in the case of partners, or where a statute obliges a person to disclose certain information. Today, however, a general principle is emerging that requires a party to speak when the information in question is within his exclusive knowledge, and is of such a nature that the other party's right to have the information communicated would be mutually recognised by honest persons in the circumstances. A failure to speak in such circumstances entitles the other party to the same remedies as in the case of a positive misrepresentation. Duress or metus is improper pressure that amounts to intimidation. It involves coercion of the will: A party is forced to choose between entering into a contract and suffering some harm. A party who consents to a contract under such circumstances does so out of fear inspired by an illegitimate threat. The consent is real but improperly obtained. The contract, therefore, is valid, but it may be set aside at the election of the threatened party, provided that certain requirements are met. There is some uncertainty about what these requirements are. It is established that the threat must be unlawful or contra bonos mores, and must have induced the contract. According to some authorities, the induced party must have a reasonable fear of some imminent or inevitable harm to him- or herself, or to his property or immediate family. In the case of a threat directed at property (duress of goods), the courts have required an unequivocal protest at the time of entry into the transaction. In addition to rescission and restitution, the threatened party may recover damages in delict for any loss caused through entry into the contract. Undue influence is also a form of improper pressure brought to bear upon a person to induce a contract, but the pressure is more subtle, involving as it does, without any threat of harm, an undermining of the will of the other party. The pressure usually emanates from a close or fiduciary relationship in which one party abuses a superior position to influence the other. To set aside a contract on the ground of undue influence, the party so affected must establish that the other party obtained an influence over him, that this influence weakened his powers of resistance and rendered his will compliant, and that the other party used this influence in an unscrupulous manner to induce an agreement that he would not have concluded with normal freedom of will. (Some authority also requires prejudice, but this is disputed.) Unconscionable exploitation of another's emergency is akin to undue influence: Both have been described as abuse of circumstances, and both render the contract voidable. In suitable cases, delictual damages may also be claimed. Commercial bribery is now recognised as a further distinct ground for rescinding a contract.  Requirements for contractual validity  = Contractual capacity = Intoxicated people lack contractual capacity. All persons, whether natural or juristic, have passive legal capacity and can therefore bear rights and duties, but not all have contractual capacity, which enables persons to conclude the contracts by which those rights and duties are conferred. Natural persons can be divided into three groups: # All natural persons, as a general rule, have full contractual capacity. # Persons without any contractual capacity, such as infants, and some mental health care users and intoxicated persons, must be represented by their guardians or administrators. # Persons with limited contractual capacity include minors. They require the consent or assistance of their parents or guardians, or of another person such as the Master of the High Court or a court order for specific transactions. A court may grant restitution to a minor where a contract is detrimental to him. Persons married in community of property must obtain the consent of the other spouse for certain, specified transactions. Trustees must act on behalf of insolvent estates. Juristic persons, including companies, close corporations, statutory entities and certain voluntary associations, are represented by authorised natural persons. The state may generally enter into contracts just like any other person, but its capacity to bind itself and its freedom to exercise its contractual powers may be limited by principles of public law. = Formalities = As a general rule, no formalities are required for a contract to be valid. (The exceptions to this occur when the law or the parties prescribe such formalities.) South African law does prescribe writing, notarial execution and registration as formalities for certain types of contract. Examples of contracts that depend for their validity on compliance with the formalities of writing and signature are: * Alienations of land (Alienation of Land Act) * Suretyships (General Law Amendment ActAct 50 of 1956) * Executory donations of anything but land (General Law Amendment Act) Examples of contracts that are valid inter partes but cannot be enforced against third parties unless they comply with the formalities of notarial execution and/or registration: * Antenuptial contracts, which require writing and notarial execution, in terms of the Deeds Registries Act;Act 47 of 1937 * Long leases of land, which require writing, notarial execution, and registration against a title deed, in terms of the Formalities in respect of Leases of Land Act;Act 18 of 1969 * Mortgages, which require writing, drawing up by a conveyancer as well as execution in presence of, attestation by, and registration by the Registrar of Deeds against a title deed; * Prospecting contracts and mining leases, which require writing, notarial execution, and registration in the Mining Titles Registry or against the title deeds. Electronic alternatives to writing and signature have been recognised for some contracts. The Electronic Communications and Transactions Act provides that information contained in a data message, and stored in a manner where it is accessible for future use, can substitute for writing. An electronic signature is likewise accepted as a signature. Alienations of land and certain long leases of land are specifically excluded. The Act applies to suretyships and executory donations of anything but land. Some general features of writing as a prescribed formality can be identified: * All material terms of the contract must be in writing. * Terms implied by law (naturalia), as well as tacit terms, need not be in writing. * The terms need not all be in one document. * Any variation of a material term of the contract has to be in writing to be effective. An extension of time, a cancellation of contract and the revival of a cancelled contract do not amount to variations. * The defence of estoppel may not be raised where a party has been misled to believe that there has been an oral variation of the contract. * If formalities are not complied with, the contract is void. The return of a performance in a void contract may be claimed with an enrichment action. An alienation of land is valid from the beginning, if both parties have performed fully. The legislature is motivated by diverse policy considerations when prescribing formalities: * The purpose behind requiring writing and signature in contracts concerning the alienation of land and suretyship is legal certainty regarding the authenticity and content of these contracts. Certainty limits litigation and discourages malpractice. * The purpose behind requiring writing and signatures for executory contracts of donation of anything but land is apparently to make sure that the donor has a serious intention to conclude the contract. * The purpose behind requiring notarial execution for antenuptial contracts and registration for long leases of land seems to be notice to third parties. There are diverse consequences for non-compliance with prescribed formalities: * Alienations of land and suretyships (and any material variation of these contracts) are invalid. * An oral donation is completed and valid when performed. * Antenuptial contracts and long leases of land are valid between the parties, but are unenforceable against third parties. The parties themselves may prescribe formalities regarding the conclusion, variation or cancellation of their contract, as well as the waiver of any right arising from their contract. Where the parties agree that their agreement must be in writing, they may have one of two possible intentions. (The first is presumed if no clear intention is evident.) Either their agreement is reduced to writing merely to facilitate proof of its terms, in which case the contract is binding immediately, or their agreement acquires legal effect only once it has been reduced to writing and signed by the parties. A non-variation clause prescribes formalities (usually writing) for any variation of the contract. Such a clause is not against public policy; it is valid and enforceable if it entrenches both itself and the other contractual terms against oral variation. This is known as the Shifren principle. Such a clause is in favour of both parties and therefore does not offend the constitutional principle of equality. A non-variation clause does sometimes have unacceptable consequences, and its application is limited. It is restrictively interpreted, because it limits the principle of freedom of contract. Cancellation of the contract and certain forms of waiver of rights (e.g. waiver of an accrued right arising from a breach of contract, datio in solutum, release of the debtor, and a pactum de non petendo) do not amount to variations. A non-variation clause is not enforced where its enforcement is against public policy or where estoppel can be raised. Neither defence has successfully been raised on the facts in any reported case. A non-cancellation clause is valid and enforceable and restrictively interpreted, and applies only to consensual cancellations. To be effective, therefore, a non- cancellation clause must be coupled with a non-variation clause. A non-waiver clause is also valid and enforceable, but it is restrictively interpreted. = Legality = An underlying principle of the law of contract (pacta sunt servanda or sanctity of contract) is that agreements seriously concluded should be enforced, but agreements that are clearly detrimental to the interests of the community as a whole, whether they are contrary to law or morality (contra bonos mores), or if they run counter to social or economic expedience, is not enforced. These contracts are illegal on the grounds of public policy. The law regards illegal or unlawful contracts either as void and thus unenforceable, or as valid but unenforceable.  Void  Public policy has no fixed meaning, because it represents the public opinion of a particular community at a particular time. Considerations of public policy are to be found in legislation, the common law, good morals or the public interest. Most of the case law about performance contra bonos mores involves immoral or sexually reprehensible conduct. The legislator sometimes expressly or impliedly prohibits the conclusion of certain contracts. Since 1994, public policy in South Africa has been anchored primarily in the values enshrined in the Constitution. The courts use their power to strike down a contract as contra bonos mores only sparingly and in the clearest of cases. It is required that the general tenor of the contract be contrary to public policy. When the relevant public interests are of a rival or even conflicting nature, the courts must balance the different interests against each other. Sanctity of contract often is given preference. The onus of proving illegality seems to rest on the party who relies on it, but a court will take notice of illegality in certain circumstances of its own accord. It is either the conclusion of a contract or its performance, or else the reason for its conclusion, that is regarded as objectionable and that renders the contract void. Certain pacta de quota litis are against public policy and void. Unfair or unreasonable contracts can be against public policy and void if a more concrete indication of public interest is involved than mere injustice between the parties. The unfair enforcement of a contract by one of the parties can also be contrary to public policy and void, but the limits of this defence are uncertain. An illegal contract that is void cannot be enforced‚Äîthis is called the ex turpi rule‚Äîbut the illegal part of an otherwise legal contract can be severed from the rest of the contract depending on the probable intention of the parties. If there has been performance on the void contract, in principle restitution should be granted, but the par delictum rule bars restitution where parties are equally morally guilty. This rule can be relaxed to see justice between the parties, depending on the facts of the case.  Valid but unenforceable  Certain wagers and some contracts in restraint of trade are examples of illegal contracts that are valid but unenforceable. The National Gambling ActAct 7 of 2004. has amended the common law with regard to gambling activities, including wagers: * Debts arising from licensed gambling activities are valid and fully enforceable in law. * Debts arising from unlicensed lawful gambling activities are valid and enforceable if the parties have an independent interest besides the outcome of the wager. If they do not have such an interest, the debts are valid but unenforceable. * Debts arising from lawful informal bets are valid, but unenforceable. * Debts arising from unlawful gambling activities are almost certainly void, as are debts from gambling activities of minors or persons excluded from participating in gambling. Public policy requires the balancing of two conflicting public interests with regard to agreements in restraint of trade. On the one hand, contracts freely entered into should be performed (sanctity of contract); on the other, everyone should be free to carry on their profession or business (freedom of trade). A contract in restraint of trade is valid and enforceable unless the party wishing to escape its consequences can prove that the restraint is contrary to the public interest and thus unenforceable. The restraint denier consequently bears the onus of proving that enforcement of the restraint is contrary to policy. An agreement in restraint of trade that is contrary to public policy is not void, but is unenforceable. A restraint- of-trade clause is contrary to public policy if the consequence of the restraint is unreasonable. In Basson v Chilwan, the court formulated a test for determining whether an agreement in restraint of trade is reasonable: # Is there an interest of the one party that is worthy of protection? Is there a protectable interest, in other words? # If so, is that interest threatened by the conduct of the other party? # If so, does that interest weigh up qualitatively and quantitatively against the interest of the other party to be economically active and productive? # Is there another aspect of public policy (having nothing to do with the relationship between the parties) that requires that the restraint should either be maintained or rejected? The question of whether a restraint is in conflict with the public interest is to be assessed with regard to the prevailing circumstances at the time enforcement is sought. An agreement in restraint of trade can be partially enforced subject to certain limitations. = Possibility and certainty = Parties cannot create contractual obligations that are impossible to perform. The impossibility of performance must be objective or absolute: that is, for all practical intents and purposes, nobody should be able to render the performance. In the case of initial impossibility, the contractual obligation is void; in the case of supervening impossibility, performance becomes impossible after conclusion of the contract. The obligation then terminates. Where a party makes performance impossible, however, the obligation does not terminate: Such a party commits breach of contract. In exceptional cases, a party may be liable despite the impossibility of performance. A party can be held liable for contractual damages if the impossibility was contemplated, or if the party warranted that performance was possible. Where performance is partially impossible, the entire contract may be void; alternatively, depending on the circumstances, there may be a proportional reduction in the counter-performance. A party can be held liable for delictual damages if he wrongfully creates the impression that performance is possible, and the other party suffers a loss. Transfers made in the purported fulfilment of contracts that are invalid due to impossibility can be reclaimed with remedies based on unjustified enrichment. It is a general requirement for the creation of contractual obligations that their contents must be certain, or capable of being rendered certain. Courts generally try to interpret a contract as valid, rather than as void for uncertainty. In some circumstances, obligations may be void for uncertainty if they are pacta de contrahendo, or because they use vague language or are of indefinite duration. The parties may agree on a mechanism for determining what has to be performed. Where this mechanism takes the form of a power granted to a third party, or possibly even to one of the parties to determine what has to be performed, the courts will (depending on the type of contract) uphold the contract, provided that the power has been exercised reasonably. An obligation that does not meet the certainty requirement is invalid. Depending on circumstances, though, it may be severable from the rest of the contract. A transfer made in purported fulfilment of an obligation that is invalid for uncertainty can be reclaimed with remedies based on unjustified enrichment.  Parties to contracts  A contract confers rights and duties on the privies, but cannot impose them on outsiders (penitus extranei). Where more than two parties conclude a contract, their involvement in sharing its rights and duties must be determined. Simple joint liability or entitlement confers on each a pro rata share: either in equal or, by agreement, in specific shares. Where the parties have joint and several liability or entitlement, they may be held liable or be entitled to any share of performance, or even the entirety. Where performance is indivisible, be it by nature or by the intentions of the parties, a plurality of parties leads to a collective joint liability or entitlement. Third parties may become involved in one way or another in the contractual relationship between others: * A principal may authorise his agent to represent him in concluding a contract. Resulting rights and duties are conferred on the principal (not the agent) and on the other contracting party. The principal in such circumstances may be unidentified or even undisclosed. (This, indeed, is often the very rationale for using an agent in the first place.) The agent may only bind a non-existing principal, however, where statute allows this. * It is possible to conclude a third-party contract (stipulatio alteri) for the benefit of a third-party beneficiary (alteri). The third-party beneficiary may claim the benefit only once he has accepted it, and under the ius quaesitum tertio principle may sue for performance. * Contractual rights and obligations can be transferred from one of the contracting parties to a third party by: ** Cession - transfer of rights ** Delegation - transfer of obligations ** Assignment - combined cession and delegationChristie, p. 547. * There are circumstances in which a person who is not a party to the contract may perform on behalf of a debtor, or in which a debtor may deliver performance to the third party.  Obligations and terms  The subject matter of a contract is contained in the terms of an agreement. These terms define and qualify the obligations a contract creates.Du Plessis, et al. p.231. = Obligations = An obligation is a legal bond between two or more persons and comprises both a right and a duty: * The debtor bears a duty to make the performance agreed upon. * The creditor has a right to claim that performance. All contracts give rise to personal rights and duties, so that a right that arises from a contractual obligation is enforceable only against the other party to that obligation.Du Plessis, et al. p.8, 232.This is in contrast with real rights, which may be enforced against the world at large.  Classifications  Obligations may be classified in various ways: = Civil, natural and moral obligations = A moral obligation, such as the duty to fulfill a promise to join a friend at the nets on Friday for cricket practice, is not regarded as a legal obligation; it has no legal significance at all. The duty derives merely from a social agreement, or from the dictates of one's conscience.Du Plessis, et al. p.232. A civil obligation, most common in contracts, is a legal obligation enforceable by a right of action, so that, if the obligation is not fulfilled, the creditor may sue the debtor for breach. A natural obligation, relatively unusual, may not be enforced in a court of law, but it is not without legal significance: * If a person performs in terms of a natural obligation, he may not later reclaim the performance on the basis that it was not owed. If performance is made, it is regarded as having been owed.Du Bois et al. 785. * Natural obligations may be set off against civil obligations. Natural obligations arise when, for example, a minor concludes a contract: If the other party is major or a juristic person, he is bound by a civil obligation, but the minor is bound only by a natural obligation. Another example would be a betting agreement or wager. = Reciprocal obligations = Reciprocal obligations are linked obligations, where one obligation is owed in exchange for another: > In a contract of sale, therefore, payment of the purchase price and delivery > of the object of the sale are owed in exchange for each other: the purchaser > therefore does not have to pay unless the seller delivers.See the section on > the exception non dimple contractual. Another example is a contract of lease, where the obligation to pay the rent is tied in with the obligation to let the premises. Where there are two obligations, ‚Äòthere are two rights, two duties, and therefore two creditors and two debtors‚Äô. = Simple, alternative, generic or facilitative obligations = * A simple obligation involves a performance that has been specified exactly by the parties in their agreement. An alternative obligation is one in which the parties agree that someone can choose a performance from two or more specified alternatives. A generic obligation is one that allows a party to choose a performance from a specified family of performances. A facilitative obligation specifies the performance owed by the debtor, but gives the debtor the right to choose to make a different specified performance. * An indivisible performance gives rise to a single obligation. A divisible performance gives rise to more than one obligation. There are as many obligations as there are indivisible performances owed in terms of a contract. A divisible contract is one that can be divided into separate contracts, each having one or more obligations. Some categories overlap, as certain obligations fall simultaneously into several of them: ‚ÄòFor example, an obligation relating to the delivery of a table lamp might be a civil, simple and reciprocal obligation, as well as entail an indivisible performance‚Äô. = Terms = The parties to a contract frequently agree upon various modifications of their implied rights and obligations. These pacts or stipulations may be agreed upon orally, or they may be embodied in a written contract in the shape of provisions of clauses. Such provisions are often loosely referred to as ‚Äòconditions‚Äô, but they are in fact not conditions at all; they are merely ‚Äòterms of performance‚Äô. The distinction between conditions and terms is of the utmost importance, since they differ in their legal effect. * A condition is either fulfilled or not, according to whether a prescribed event does or does not take place. If the condition is fulfilled, it has an automatic effect, either creating or cancelling a contractual obligation. The fulfilment of a condition cannot be enforced, however. * A term, on the other hand, imposes an obligation upon the party or parties concerned to make certain performance. If such party does not make the performance as prescribed by the term, he is in breach of contract, and the other party may invoke the appropriate remedies for breach. For example, suppose that Armand agrees to sell his motor car to Cameron for R100,000 subject to Ali's approval of the car, the price to be paid in monthly instalments of R10,000 each. The provision as to Ali's approval is a condition, while that relating to the method of payment is a term of performance. Terms, then, are those stipulations in the contract that the parties have agreed on, and that bind them to perform. The terms of a contract set out the nature and details of the performance due by the parties under the contract: that is, the nature and description of the commodities or services to be rendered, and the manner, time and place of performance. Not all terms are necessarily in the written contract itself. Terms comprise both the stipulations that the parties include in their contract, and those provisions included by law. Contracts do not have to fall into any particular category, but certain traditional kinds are recognised, along with their own particular rules and terms and consequences. The word term was formerly restricted to a provision relating to time: that is, a dies or time clause. The word, however, is now in general use as referring to any term of performance. There is a distinction, then, between South African and English law, where terms and conditions are synonymous, and where they are used interchangeably. In South Africa, a condition is a very special type of contractual term, operating in a specific way; for example, ‚ÄòI will pay you R3,000 if you climb Table Mountain‚Äô. It remains the case in South Africa, however, that the word condition is very loosely used in the drafting of contracts. In the following formulation‚Äî‚ÄòI agree to donate R50,000 on condition that...‚Äô‚Äîwhat we have is not a condition but a modus or modal clause.  Essentialia, naturalia and incidentalia  The primary rights and obligations flowing from a particular contract are those the parties expressly or tacitly agreed upon, and also those the law implies. This contrasts with secondary rights and obligations (such as the duty to pay damages and the duty to restore performances received prior to termination), which arise after a breach of contract. It is not necessary for the parties to agree upon any special rights or obligations other than those essential to their particular contracts (essentialia); all obligations concerning the manner, time or place of performance are regulated and are implied by law as soon as the parties have made their contract (naturalia). For example, if Sa Roj has agreed to sell her motor car to Bosie for R100,000, all the rights and obligations of both of them are regulated by the law. Sa Roj becomes subject to an obligation to deliver the car to Bosie at Bosie's request, and Bosie is obliged to pay Sa Roj the R100 000 the moment Bosie has accepted delivery of the car. Similar principles apply to all other types of contract. The parties may, however, agree upon some modification or variation of their implied rights and obligations, provided they are not illegal (incidentalia). For example, in the case supposed, they may agree that the sale of the car is to take place only if the car is approved of by Rodney, or they may agree that the R100,000 is payable in monthly instalments of R10,000. These modifications of the contract, it will be seen directly, constitute either ‚Äòconditions‚Äô or ‚Äòterms of performance‚Äô. According to the Roman-Dutch classification, then, terms may be classified as essentialia, naturalia or incidentalia: * Essentialia are distinctive terms used to identify or classify a contract as one of the specific types of contract recognised by law. Cash and commodities, for example, make for contracts of sale. Essentialia are of the essence in a contract, without which it cannot subsist, and for want of which there is either no contract or a contract of a different kind. * Naturalia are terms automatically included, by operation of law (ex lege), in any contract belonging to one of the classes of specific contract traditionally recognised in South Africa.In other words, the common law imposes these terms on the contract. Naturalia are based on what is fair and reasonable between contracting parties over contracts of that kind. In a sale contract, for instance, the seller may not sell something that is defective. There are also guarantees against eviction in lease agreements.Van der Westhuizen v Arnold 2002 (6) SA 453 (SCA). Generally speaking, the parties may exclude or vary naturalia by express agreement, in exclusion or exemption clauses (e.g. an ‚Äòas is‚Äô clause, known as a ‚Äòvoetstoots clause‚Äô, excluding the implied warranty against latent defects), though the courts interpret such agreements narrowly. * Incidentalia (or accidentalia) are all terms other than the essentialia and naturalia: that is, additional terms agreed upon expressly by the parties that supplement or modify the rights and duties incorporated by law into a particular contract. Modern classification, as applied by the courts, generally favours the distinction between terms express and implied.  Express terms  Express terms are specifically and explicitly agreed upon by the parties, fixed by the actual agreement, and are either articulated in an oral contract or written down. They are the most important terms in the contract. = Signed contracts: caveat subscriptor = A person who signs a written contract is ordinarily bound by its terms in terms of the maxim caveat subscriptor: let the signatory beware. = Standard-form contracts = Express terms in standardised contracts are dealt with differently from express terms negotiated by the parties, in that a party presenting a standardised contract to another for signature is expected to draw his attention to any unexpected terms, failing which the signatory may not be bound. = Unsigned documents = Express terms may also be incorporated into a contract by reference to one or more other documents. = Ticket cases and notices = ticket, with express legal terms. Express terms contained on tickets and notices that are posted up in public places may also be binding, depending on whether the party denying that he is bound by the terms was aware of their existence or ought reasonably to have been aware of them in the circumstances. = Consumer Protection Act = The Consumer Protection Act provides that customers‚Äô attention must be drawn to certain categories of clauses or notices that could be prejudicial. In respect of serious or unexpected risks, customers must indicate their assent by signature or by other positive conduct. = Terms prohibited by law/implied terms= Certain terms are prohibited by law. Terms contrary to public policy, or in conflict with a statutory prohibition are not enforced. Sometimes courts are given the power to modify objectionable terms. = Tacit contracts = Tacit contracts are inferred from the conduct of the parties and are very controversial. Some writers hold that terms expressed by the parties' conduct may be regarded as tacit, whereas others hold that actual agreement is necessary. Tacit contracts also present problems as to their conceptual basis, the question being whether or not they should fall under the banner of express terms at all.  Implied terms  Implied terms are not explicitly agreed upon by the parties but nevertheless form part of the contract. They are binding on the parties without their having made any explicit agreement as to the points in question. They are effectively naturalia and usually entail legal duties, and in some cases may be varied or excluded by the parties, as in a contract of sale voetstoots. These terms derive from the common law, from trade usage or customs, and from statute. Most terms implied in law come from the common law, but there is not a closed list, because contract law is not static. A term may not be implied if it conflicts with the contract's express terms, or if these indicate that the parties did not wish to include that term. As Corbett AJA noted in Alfred McAlpine v Transvaal Provincial Administration, ‚ÄòIn legal parlance the expression ‚Äúimplied term‚Äù is an ambiguous one in that it is often used, without discrimination, to denote two, possibly three, distinct concepts‚Äô.531D. Terms may be implied, in other words: # By operation of law (ex lege) # By custom or trade usage # From the facts surrounding the agreement of the parties, or better say from the unarticulated intentions of the parties (ex consensu) For present purposes, it suffices to focus on the first and the last of these‚Äîthe second is usually merged into the first‚Äîand on the ambiguity between them. = Terms implied ex lege = A term implied in law (a naturale) is one that the law, in the absence of agreement to the contrary by the parties, and in some cases compulsorily, attaches to the particular class of contract. Many of the terms of performance or obligations of the parties in contracts such as sale, letting and hiring, or agency, are implied in law. For example, suppose that the owner of a grandstand lets a seat on it to a spectator for a certain day. The former is under an obligation to keep the stand in a proper state of repair, a term to that effect being implied in law in all contracts of letting and hiring of property. Terms implied ex lege, or in law, may derive from the common law (as developed by the courts), from trade usage or custom, or from statute. (In the case of the common law, they have already been discussed in the section dealing with naturalia.) Terms implied ex lege may be varied or excluded expressly by the parties. A custom is a particular rule that has existed, either actually or presumptively, from time immemorial in a particular locality, where it has obtained the force of law despite conflicting with or not being found in the general law of the land. A term can be implied on the basis of trade usage, but such an implication is made not in law, strictly speaking, but on the basis of the parties‚Äô presumed intentions. Trade usages do not apply to a particular space; they develop in a particular profession or trade. In the case of Golden Cape Fruits v Fotoplate,1973 (2) SA 642 (C). Corbett JA established the requirements. The trade usage must be: * Uniformly and universally observed * Long established * Reasonable, so that one would expect people in the trade to be aware of it * Notorious * Certain * Not in conflict with positive law * Not conflict with an express term of the contract In Coutts v Jacobs,1927 EDL 120. for instance, Jacobs consigned goods to Coutts, who sold them and charged commission, which Jacobs refused to pay. The judgment went against him, the court finding that there was a trade usage whereby wool sales agents were entitled to charge commission. = Tacit terms = A term implied in fact is generally referred to as a tacit term. A tacit term is a wordless understanding between contracting parties. These are terms the parties must have had in mind but did not expressly articulate because they are so obvious. A tacit term is implied where the contract is silent on the point, but where it is clear that the parties intended to include the term, and they would not have contracted other than on the basis of that term. A tacit term, accordingly, has the same legal effect as an express term. It is derived from the common intention of the parties, and is in this way an exception to the parol evidence rule. The common intention of the parties in such a case is inferred by the court from the express terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances, including the subsequent conduct of the parties. Suppose, in the example given above, that the spectator hired the seat for the purpose of seeing a certain ceremony that both parties contemplated would take place on that day, but that no express reference to the ceremony was made by the parties in contracting. A term is implied from the circumstances that the hiring is conditional on the ceremony taking place on the day in question. The courts often deploy the officious- bystander testReigate v Union Manufacturing 1918 (1) KB 592 at 605.Shirlaw v Southern Foundries 1939 (2) KB 206. at 227. to determine whether or not a contract contains a tacit term, imagining that an impartial bystander had been present at the conclusion of the contract and had asked what might happen in a situation the parties had not expressly foreseen: If the answer is self- evident to the parties, the term is taken to be incorporated as a tacit term. If, therefore, the parties are engaged in a particular trade and know that there is a trade usage governing their transaction, they are taken to have tacitly incorporated it into their contract. There being a presumption that parties in entering into an agreement have given expression to all the terms by which they intend to be bound, the courts are slow to find that an implied term affects their reciprocal obligations and will never do so if the effect of the implication would be to prejudice the rights of third parties. A term will not be implied merely because it is reasonable to do so; the courts will not make a contract for the parties. The implication must be necessary in the business sense to give efficacy to the contract. It is not necessary, however, that the parties should have consciously envisaged the situation. It is sufficient that their common intention was such that a reference to such a possible situation by a hypothetical ‚Äòofficious bystander‚Äô would have evoked from them a prompt and unanimous assertion of the implied term. A term sought to be implied in a contract must be capable of clear and exact formulation. The party claiming the existence of a tacit term must formulate it clearly and precisely. Whether or not a term is implied depends upon the facts of each particular case. One general question concerns the effect of a contract's being reduced to writing. An entire agreement clause in a contract has been said not to preclude the existence of a tacit term; it seems this also holds good when a statute requires the terms of the contract to be in writing. Another question related to the standard of proof that must be satisfied. The Appellate Division left this unanswered, after noting that there are two lines of authority when it comes to the proof of tacit contracts. Although none of them purports to resolve the issue, more judicial pronouncements follow the more stringent test that there must be no other reasonable interpretation than that the parties intended to, and did in fact, contract on the terms alleged than follow the less demanding ‚Äòmost plausible probable conclusion‚Äô test.  Kerr's classification  In addition to essentialia, naturalia and incidentalia, on the one hand, and implied and express terms, on the other, Prof. AJ Kerr of Rhodes University offers another popular classification of contractual terms. He divides them more narrowly: * Invariable terms are those that cannot be altered; no contract can exist without them. There are two types: # Essentials # Terms imposed by statute * Express terms are those expressed by the parties. * Implied terms are implied between the parties. They are imposed on the contract by implication. * Residual terms (ex lege) are implied by law. They apply to a contract in the absence of invariable, express or implied terms, and exist outside of the agreement.  Material terms  To determine the nature of the relief one party can claim on a breach of a term by the other, the terms of a contract are sometimes distinguished as either ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô or ‚Äònon-material‚Äô. Generally, in the absence of a clause that provides for cancellation (a lex commissoria), rescission of a contract is permissible only if the breach in question is regarded as a material breach, which is usually the case if it relates to a material (or essential or vital term)‚Äîthat is, one that goes to the root of the contract. Material terms are those vital to the performance of obligations. The breach of a material term entitles the innocent party to cancel the contract. Breach of a non-material term gives rise to a claim for damages only. A good deal of confusion has been caused in South African law by the expression warranty, which has a variety of technical meanings in English law. In South Africa, the word warranty is non-technical and simply means ‚Äòterm‚Äô. Unfortunately, the use of the words condition and warranty in the English-law sense is relatively common in South Africa. This causes difficulties in the construction of documents. The distinction between material and non-material terms applies to terms, whether they are created expressly or implied.  Conditions  A condition in South Africa is a term that qualifies a contractual obligation so as to make its operation and consequences dependent on the occurrence of some uncertain future event. The event must be not only future but also uncertain‚Äîsomething that may or may not take place. The fate of the obligation depends on whether the event takes place or not. Conditions are usually classified in three ways, by: # The effect of the fulfilment of the condition on the obligation (whether, that is, it creates or discharges the obligation) # The nature of the event attached to the condition # with whom lies the power to fulfill the condition The first of these is the most important. Its effect can be either suspensive or resolutive, or both. = Effect of fulfilment = This is the most common form of conditional classification. If the parties agree that the performance of obligations under the contract is not enforceable until a certain condition is fulfilled, that condition is a suspensive one. As Van den Heever J noted, however, in Odendaalsrust Municipality v New Nigel Estate Gold Mining,1948 (2) SA 656 (O). ‚ÄòThe contract (in the modern sense, now that all contracts are consensual) is binding immediately upon its conclusion; what may be suspended by a condition is the resultant obligation or its exigible content‚Äô.666-667. In other words, the contract comes into being when the agreement is entered into, but the requirement of performance kicks in only if and when the condition is satisfied. In the example of a father who promises his daughter that he will buy a car for her if she passes her examinations, the contract forms when these terms are agreed to, but the father's obligation to buy the car sets in only if his daughter passes her examinations. Usually a suspensive condition must be fulfilled within a reasonable period of time, though sometimes the parties attach a period of time to the condition. A suspensive condition (or condition precedent), therefore, is one that suspends the operation of the obligation until the condition is fulfilled. Pending the fulfilment of the suspensive condition, the parties are clearly in a contractual relationship from which neither may unilaterally resile. Although the operation of the contract is suspended, it gives rise not merely to a spes debiti but to contingent rights and duties that are recognised by law. For example, those rights may be protected by interdict, are capable of cession, and are transmissible on death. Until the condition is fulfilled, however, the obligation is neither enforceable nor capable of being performed. The better view is that the nature of the contract is unaffected by the condition. In the example given above, the contract is not innominate prior to fulfilment of the condition; it is simply a conditional sale. Upon the fulfilment of the condition, however, the contract becomes absolute, and it has a retroactive effect. It dates back to the moment when the agreement was made, which is then regarded as having been unconditional from the outset. A suspensive condition must be fulfilled in its entirety, unless the parties intended that fulfilment of part of the condition should entail performance of part of the promise. If the condition is not fulfilled, the obligation is treated as void ab initio, unless the condition is for the sole benefit of a party who waives the benefit of the condition within the time stipulated for fulfilment, by proper notification to the other party. Where no time is stipulated, the obligation is discharged if a condition, of a type that is not for the specific benefit of one party only, remains unfulfilled after the lapse of a reasonable time. Another example of a suspensive condition is a sale of a thing subject to the thing's being approved of by a third person. A suspensive condition should not be confused with a term or stipulation relating to time of performance. In the case of a suspensive condition, the operation of the obligation flowing from the contract is suspended, in whole or in part, pending the occurrence or non- occurrence of a particular specified event. A term of the contract, on the other hand, imposes a contractual obligation on a party to act, or to refrain from acting, in a particular manner. A contractual obligation flowing from a term of the contract can be enforced, but no action lies to compel the performance of a condition. It follows that a provision as to time of performance is simply a term of the contract: for example, where a company on a certain date declares a dividend ‚Äòpayable to all shareholders registered‚Äô on a certain later date the right to the dividend vests in the shareholders on the date of the declaration, but the dividend is claimable only on the later date. The nature of the contract may affect the rights of the parties when there is a suspensive condition.Odendaalsrust Municipality v New Nigel Estate Gold Mining 1948 (2) SA 656 (O). It has been held that, where an agreement of purchase and sale has been entered into subject to a suspensive condition, no contract of sale is then and there established; it develops into one of sale only on fulfilment of the condition.Corondimas v Badat 1946 AD 548.Palm Fifteen v Cotton Tail Homes 1978 (2) SA 872 (A).Soja v Tuckers Land and Development 1981 (3) SA 314 (A).Tuckers Land and Development v Strydom 1984 (1) SA 1 (A). This statement of the law, or what has been described as the Corondimas principle, has been much criticised, even though it has consistently been applied in subsequent cases. Although it was applied again, on the grounds of precedent, by the Appellate Division in Tuckers Land and Development v Strydom, its correctness was questioned and criticised, obiter by Van Heerden JA, and directly by Joubert JA. The latter, reviewing the old authorities, showed that the principle was not in accordance with Roman and Roman-Dutch law. ‚ÄòIt would seem, however‚Äô, wrote Tebbutt J in ABSA v Sweet,1993 (1) SA 318 (C). ‚Äòthat in a contract of lease no such considerations apply and a contractual relationship comes into existence between the lessor and the lessee on the signing of the lease although the resultant obligations arising from the lease may be suspended‚Äô.323A. It is apparently also now accepted,Pothier 220.Wessels 1352.Kerr 4th ed. 339-40.De Wet & Yeats 137.Marnitz v Stark 1952 (2) SA 144 (N) at 148B.Peri-Urban Areas Health Board v Tomaselli 1962 (3) SA 346 (A). when a suspensive condition is fulfilled, that the contract and the parties‚Äô mutual rights ‚Äòrelate back to, and are deemed to have been in force from, the date of the agreement and not from the date of the fulfilment of the condition, i.e. ex tunc‚Äô.323B. On the other hand, if the parties agree that the obligations under a contract should operate in full, but comes to an end if an uncertain future event either does or does not happen, they are said to have agreed to a resolutive condition (or condition subsequent). The continued existence of the contract depends on the event happening or not happening, as the case may be: for example, \\"I shall buy and give you a car on the condition that, if you fail your exams, I will take the car back.\\" Another example would be a contract of sale whereby one sells a car on the condition that, if the buyer fails to pay the price by a certain date, it will be repossessed. A resolutive condition, then, is one that discharges an existing obligation the moment the condition is fulfilled. Prior to the fulfilment of the condition attached to the contract, the contract has full legal effect, and either party may claim performance by the other of his obligations. Upon the fulfilment of the condition, the contract is terminated and is regarded as if it had never existed. The consequence is that each party may claim to be restored to his original position. For example, if Jess fails her exams, she must restore the car to Rodney. = Nature of the event = A positive condition depends on the occurrence of an uncertain future event: ‚ÄòIf Richman marries Anjanette‚Äô, for example. A positive condition is fulfilled if and when the event contemplated by the parties takes place. It is fair to say that the preponderance of suspensive conditions is positive. A negative condition depends on an uncertain future event's not happening. When it becomes clear that an event can no longer take place, the condition is satisfied and the agreement works on that basis. Negative conditions are generally resolutive. = Who has the power of fulfilment = Conditions may also be potestative, casual or mixed, depending on whether the operation of the obligation is dependent on the creditor's actions or on events beyond the control of the parties. A causal condition depends for its fulfilment on some third party or outside agency or event, like chance, and not upon the action of either party: ‚ÄòIf Armand attains the age of twenty-five‚Äô, for example, or ‚ÄòIf Armand has children‚Äô. The classic example is a contract of insurance, whereby the insurer makes a promise of reimbursement in the case of loss (as, for example, by flood or fire). A potestative condition depends for its fulfilment on one of the contracting parties; it is entirely in the power of one of the parties. An example would be where Zola agreed to give her neighbour, Jaylynne, a sum of money if Jaylynne would cut down a tree that obstructed her view. If Jaylynne undertakes to cut down the tree in return for the money, the agreement is not conditional: Jaylynne is bound to perform her side of the bargain. A pure potestative condition si volam, which reserves to the promisor an unlimited choice as to whether to perform or not‚Äî‚ÄòI shall give you R100 if I so wish‚Äô‚Äîclearly gives rise to no obligation whatsoever, but the position is otherwise if fulfilment depends on the will of the promisee (where, for example, Andrew gives Bianca an option to buy his farm). A potestative condition may be negative, as where Andrew makes a gift to Bianca on condition that Bianca refrains from doing something. A promise subject to a negative potestative condition is exigible only at the death of the promisee, for only then is the condition fulfilled. A mixed condition is one composed of both elements: casual and potestative: for example, ‚ÄòIf Francois (one of the contracting parties) marries Cindi (some third person)‚Äô, or ‚Äòif the children continue to reside with their mother (the beneficiary)‚Äô. A mixed condition depends for its fulfilment on both or one of the parties to the contract, as well as a third party or chance event. It is a mixture of the potestative and the causal. As an example, quite common in wills, one may make an obligation under a contract subject to the condition that the other party marry someone. The condition attached to the obligation must be possible. = Fictional fulfilment = Even if, in the case of a positive condition, the contemplated event does not take place, there may be what is called ‚Äòfictional fulfilment‚Äô of the condition. A contracting party must not obstruct the fulfilment of a condition. If the party who would be bound by the condition being fulfilled deliberately prevents its fulfilment to escape the obligation, the condition is deemed to have been fulfilled‚Äîwith the consequence that the obligation becomes absolute. A legal fiction comes into effect. MacDuff v JCICase: 1924 AD 573. is the leading case in this area. Although negligent prevention of fulfilment does not trigger this principle, there may be a duty on a party to take active steps to bring about fulfilment of the condition, either because the contract stipulates such a duty or because omission of such steps would render fulfilment impossible. In such a case neglect to take the steps would bring about fictional fulfilment. For example, if Perry agrees to buy Robert's house, subject to his obtaining a loan from a bank or building society by a certain date, and Perry makes no effort to obtain the loan because of a sudden slump in the property market, the condition is considered fulfilled, and Perry is bound to the contract of sale. The operation of this principle is subject to the interests of third parties. The above refers to suspensive conditions. It is generally thought that the principle of fictional fulfilment can be extended to the fictional non-fulfilment of a resolutive condition although there is no Roman-Dutch authority precisely in point.  Time clauses  A time clause (dies) is a contractual term that makes the existence of an obligation dependent on an event or time that is certain to arise in the future. Such clauses may be either suspensive or resolutive: * An example of a suspensive time clause would be one that permits a car buyer to take the purchased vehicle now, but only commence payment in three weeks. In other words, the agreement suspends the date of payment until a certain date in the future. * A resolutive time clause stipulates the duration of the contract, after which it ceases. Although it comes into existence and is performed right away, it will, at a certain future point, be resolved and the obligation terminated. Lease contracts and fixed period contracts of employment are common examples.  Other common contractual terms  Other significant contractual terms include suppositions, modal clauses, exemption clauses and non-variation clauses. = Assumptions and suppositions = The effect of a contract or obligation is often made contingent on the truth of an assumption the parties have made about a past or present fact. If Johann and Piet, for example, are negotiating a contract to buy and sell a painting, Johann may stipulate that he will make the purchase only if the painting is an original Rembrandt. They call in an expert. If their supposition is confirmed, the contract proceeds, if not, the contract falls away. Similarly, Fourie v CDMO Homes1982 (1) SA 21 (A). involved a sale of land, adjacent to a river, by CDMO to Fourie, whose offer had been subject to the following condition: that there were pump rights to the river. Although the parties were unsure that this was so, they concluded their agreement on the supposition that pump rights existed. = Modal clauses = A modus is a term wherewith one party qualifies the other party's right to performance in some way. Usually it involves the condition that the other party use or refrain from using the performance in a particular way. Failure to comply with a modal clause constitutes a breach of contract. Contracts of donation often have modal clauses attached to them. For example: \\"I will donate R100,000 bursary to Rhodes University for a Catholic male student.\\" If, ignoring for present purposes the constitutional limits on freedom of testation,See Minister of Education v Syfrets Trust 2006 (4) SA 205 (C), where a bequest to males of \\"European descent,\\" excluding Jews, constituted \\"unfair discrimination.\\" Considering public policy as reflected in South Africa's foundational legal values of non-racialism and non-sexism and equality, Nicholson J considered it to be in the public interest that the offending provision be appropriately varied. The offending words were deleted. the university should instead make that bursury available to a Muslim female, it would be in breach. Examples of modal clauses include property contracts, restrictive covenants and negative servitudes that have to be registered. They are commonly attached to the contract. = Warranties = A warranty is a written assurance that some product or service will be provided or will meet certain specifications. The relevant contracting party assumes absolute or strict liability for performance. In Schmidt v Dwyer,1959 (3) SA 896 (C). it was ruled that a warranty could not be overridden by a voetstoots clause. There are, generally speaking, three kinds of warranty: # Express warranties, to which the parties expressly agree, and include in the written contract # Implied warranties, which are determined as per the officious-bystander test # Residual warranties, which apply to contracts because of the operation of the common law, as in the case of Van der Westhuizen v Arnold, with the warranty against eviction, or in the case of the rule against selling defective goods = Exemption clauses = Exemption or exclusionary clauses are the opposite of warranties, exempting persons from liability that would ordinarily apply to them under the law, or limiting their liability. To be effective in a given instance, such a provision must, of course, form part of the contract, and also encompass the liability and circumstances at issue. The law must also permit the alleged exemption or exclusion. Whether or not an exemption or limitation forms part of a contract turns on whether or not it has been agreed to, and usually depends on the operation of the doctrine of quasi-mutual assent, which protects someone who reasonably assumes that the other party assents thereto. The assent may be indicated: * By a signature on a document (in which case the principle is traditionally expressed by the phrase caveat subscriptor) * By conduct, which is the case where the clause appears, for example, on a ticket or on a notice at the entrance to premises The facts of a particular case may fit into both classes. Hutchison and Du Bois submit ‚Äúthat this classification is merely a matter of convenience and of no actual importance.‚ÄùHutchison and Du Bois ‚ÄúContracts‚Äù 812. Whether the exemption or limitation forms part of any document or notice assented to depends on the interpretation of the pertinent document in accordance with the principles discussed above. In the absence of actual consent, the question is essentially whether, in light of the nature and appearance of the document in question, as well as the parties‚Äô conduct, it was reasonable for the party relying on the clause to assume that the other party assented to the clause, or was prepared to be bound by the terms of the document, whatever they were. This depends especially on the: * Steps taken to bring the existence of the clause to the other's attention * Sufficiency of the steps, depending on the nature of the document, the clause in question, as well as its presentation * Particular circumstances of the parties Of course, the effectiveness of such a clause may also be nullified by the usual principles relating to misrepresentation, fraud, duress, undue influence and mistake. Exemption clauses are commonly deployed by big business for planning, for protection from liabilities and to control variables that are otherwise uncontrolled. Although an important feature of contracts, the fact that they are used on such a large scale means that they are approached by the courts with suspicion and: # Interpreted restrictively,Afrox Healthcare v Strydom 2002 (6) SA 21 (SCA), para 9. particularly if they are unclear # Tested against the dictates of public policy.Afrox Healthcare v Strydom. The Constitution, as illustrated in Barkhuizen v Napier,2007 (5) SA 323 (CC). plays an important background role here.  Restrictive interpretation  If an exemption is clear and concise, there is very little room to manoeuvre. The courts are bound by the dolus rule. The difficulty here is that most exemption clauses are vague and ambiguous. The courts' attitude, well illustrated in Wells v SA Alumenite,1927 AD 69. is to interpret them very strictly. If the clause is clear and unambiguous in its meaning, the courts give it that meaning. In Durban's Water Wonderland v Botha,1999 (1) SA 982 (SCA). where the respondent and her child sustained injuries when they were thrown off a malfunctioning jet ride at an amusement park, the court found that the exemption clause clearly covered any liability based on negligence related to the ride's design or manufacture. This approach has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeal in more recent cases.Walker v Redhouse 2007 (3) SA 514.Drifter's Adventure Tours v Hircock 2007 (2) SA 83 (SCA). If the clause is ambiguous, the court interprets it narrowly and contra proferens. The contra proferentem principle provides the basis for determining the reach of such clauses. They are interpreted restrictively, confining them within reasonable bounds to the extent that this can be done without straining the clear meaning of a clause. This interpretation must be one to which the language is fairly susceptible;FNB v Rosenblum 2001 (4) SA 189 (SCA), para 6. it must not be fanciful or remote. This means, for example, a provision may not be treated as an exemption clause at all, or a widely drawn clause may be interpreted as not referring to legal grounds of liability, or to cover only the minimum degree of blameworthiness for which the party would be liable, or not to deal with the circumstances of the claim, or not to protect against liability where this ‚Äòwould make a mockery of the other provisions of the contract‚Äô, in view of the obligations specifically assumed. In this regard, the court must examine, among other things, the nature of the contract and its content, and the nature of the dealings between the parties. In Weinberg v Olivier,1943 AD 181. the owner of a garage was found to be liable for damage to a car parked there, in spite of an exemption clause in the basic bailment contract,A bailment contract is an agreement whereby one party temporarily hands something to another for safekeeping, with an undertaking from the second party that he will care for that thing as a reasonable person would. Examples include the loan for use (commodatum), loan for consumption (mutuum), deposit (depositum), and pledge (pignus). because it did not to cover damage occurring outside the garage.  Public policy  It is now firmly settled that an exemption clause can protect against liability for a ‚Äúfundamental breach‚Äù of contract. Exemption clauses often bring into issue questions of equity between big business and the common man: for example, as cited (unsuccessfully) by a patient in his claim against a hospital in Afrox Healthcare v Strydom. The fact that exemption clauses are generally held to be operative does not mean that a specific exclusionary clause cannot be declared contrary to public policy and as such unenforceable. The governing principle is that the courts will not enforce agreements judged to be contrary to public policy. The standard applied in respect of exclusionary clauses is no different from that applicable to other contractual terms that are invalid as a result of considerations of public policy. The question is whether upholding the relevant clause or other term would conflict with the interests of the public as a result of extreme unfairness or other policy issues;Paras 9-10. in other words, whether a contractual provision, in view of its extreme unfairness or other policy considerations, conflicts with the interests of society. This has very rarely been shown to the courts‚Äô satisfaction. A party cannot seek to exempt himself from liability for loss or damage to the property of another caused by his own dolus or by that of his servants. To permit of such a situation would be contra bonos mores. A party cannot exempt himself from liability for the wilful misconduct, or criminal or dishonest activity (fraud,Wells v SA Alumenite. in other words), of himself or his employees or agents. In Wells v SA Alumenite, the aggrieved party had been induced into buying a lighting company based on a misrepresentation, but there was a clause exempting seller from any misrepresentation. The Appellate Division held that, \\"if people sign such conditions they must, in the absence of fraud, be held to them. Public policy so demands.\\"73. Although it is clearly established a clause seeking to exclude liability for fraud is invalid, yet liability may be excluded for employees‚Äô dishonest conduct if their employer does not profit from it, and even for a party's own ‚Äúwilful default.‚Äù A party can be exempted from liability not only for negligence but, as per Afrox, also for gross negligence. In Government of the Republic of South Africa v Fibrespinners & Weavers1977 (2) SA 324. the Appellate Division gave effect to a clause exempting an employer from liability for theft by its employee. More recently, FNB v Rosenblum confirmed this approach. Where one exempts oneself from negligence, however, one should do so explicitly. In cases of ambiguity, the clause is interpreted not to exclude liability for negligence. Inequality of bargaining power is not in itself a ground for nullifying exemption clauses; nor does the principle of good faith operate as an independent criterion. The Constitution provides considerable potential for cutting down the range of permissible exemption clauses, however. A clause drafted in terms that exceed the bounds of what is permissible is confined to those bounds, rather than invalidated.  Interpretation  Because many contractual disputes, perhaps the majority, arise out of disagreement concerning the meaning of contractual provisions, interpretation of contracts is an important area. = The law applicable to contracts = Sometimes a court is faced with a contract involving a foreign element: for example, where the contract has been made in one country, but is to be performed, wholly or partially, in some other country. The court then has to determine which legal system governs the contract. This determination is made by applying the appropriate conflict or choice-of-law rule. The law that is actually held to be applicable is known as ‚Äúthe proper law of the contract.‚Äù In the South African system, the rule is that the proper or governing law of the contract depends in the first instance on the express or implied intention of the parties. If the parties have expressly agreed (usually by means of a ‚Äúchoice-of-law‚Äù clause) that the law of a particular country shall govern their contract, their choice normally prevails. Where there is no such express agreement, circumstances may nevertheless be present from which a tacit choice of law may be inferred (for example, where the contract deals with concepts peculiar to a particular system), but such cases are in the nature of things relatively rare. In the absence of any such choice by the parties, express or implied, the court simply assign a governing law to the contract. Traditionally this is done on the basis of a presumed intention fictitiously imputed to the parties, but the more modern approach is for the proper law to be determined objectively, with reference to the factual links between the agreement and the various relevant legal systems. In other words, the court selects the legal system ‚Äúwith which the transaction has its closest and most real connection.‚Äù Usually this is the law of the country where the contract was made or signed (the lex loci contractus), or, when performance is to be tendered in another country, the law of that country (the lex loci solutionis). It has been argued that, in view of modern methods of communication and international trade, the weight of the locus celebrate contractus in assigning the governing law is diminishing. It is important to note, however, that the court is not restricted in its choice of proper law by any rigid rules, and may in appropriate cases assign to the contract some other governing law. Normally, the contract is governed by a single proper law throughout its existence, since the rights and duties of the parties would be distorted if some were to be governed by one system of law and others by another. However, the manner of performance of the contractual obligations may differ according to the lex loci solutionis. The proper law of the contract governs virtually all aspects of the contract, including its essential validity, nature, content, mode of performance and interpretation. By way of exception, however, the contractual capacity of the parties, together with the formalities of execution, are governed by the lex loci contractus, unless the contract concerns immovable property, in which case the law of the country where the property is situated (the lex situs or rei situae) applies. But it seems that a contract that does not comply with the formal requirements of the lex loci contractus is nonetheless formally valid if it complies as to form with the proper law of the contract. = The intention of the parties = \\"The primary purpose of the interpretation of a contract,\\" writes Catherine Maxwell, \\"is to give effect to the intentions of the parties.\\"Du Plessis, et al. p.254. The primary rule, therefore, is that effect must be given to the parties' common intention: that is, to what both of them intended on entering into the contract. As Innes J put it in Joubert v Enslin,1910 AD 6. \\"The golden rule applicable to the interpretation of all contracts is to ascertain and to follow the intention of the parties.\\"37. If, therefore, the contract or admissible evidence gives a definite indication of the parties' meaning, the court should effect that meaning. This essentially subjective undertaking is generally understood to be the ideal in contractual interpretation. Where a contract has been put into writing, the language used by the parties is frequently vague or ambiguous and if a dispute arises as to what the parties meant, it becomes necessary to ascertain what in fact they did intend. In ascertaining their intention various rules or canons of construction are employed. The chief of these rules are as follows. = Ordinary meaning = In practice, however, the approach is objective. The traditional approach is a conservative one that concentrates on the language of the agreement. The intentions of the parties must be gathered from the language of the contract and not from what either of them might have had in mind. Probably this approach is best articulated in Hansen, Schrader & Co. v De Gasperi:1903 TH 100. > Now, it is not for this Court to speculate as to what the intentions of the > parties were when they entered into the contract. That must be gathered from > their language, and it is the duty of the Court as far as possible to give > to the language used by the parties its ordinary grammatical meaning.103. In determining the common intention of the parties, then, the court must consider first the literal and ordinary meaning of the words in their contract.Rand Rietfontein Estates Ltd v Cohn 1937 A.D. 317 at 325.Coopers & Lybrand and Others v Bryant 1995 (3) SA 761 (AD) at 767E. The court in Hansen was concerned not with the parties' intention so much as with whether their intention could clearly be apprehended in the actual document. Hence Innes J, in Joubert v Enslin: \\"If the contract itself, or any evidence admissible under the circumstances, affords a definite indication of the meaning of the contracting parties, then it seems to me that a court should always give effect to that meaning.\\" If the wording speaks with sufficient clarity, in other words, it must be taken to express the parties' common intention. As Joubert JA put it in Coopers & Lybrand v Bryant,1995 (3) SA 761 (A) \\"the language in the document is to be given its grammatical and ordinary meaning unless it would result in some absurdity or some repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument.\\"767E. \\"Recourse to authoritative dictionaries is, of course, a permissible and often helpful method available to the Courts to ascertain the ordinary meaning of words,\\" notes Hefer JA in Fundstrust v Van Deventer.1997 (1) SA 710 (A) 727B. \\"But judicial interpretation cannot be undertaken, as Schreiner JA observed in Jaga v D√∂nges1950 (4) SA 653 (A) at 664H. [...] by 'excessive peering at the language to be interpreted without sufficient attention to the contextual scene'.\\"727B-C. In Joubert's words, \\"The mode of construction should never be to interpret the particular word or phrase in isolation (in vacuo) by itself.\\"676H. = Parol evidence rule = When a contract has been reduced to writing and litigation subsequently takes place concerning the contract or its terms, it happens not infrequently that one, if not both, of the parties desires to give oral evidence to show that the terms of the contract were other than those embodied in the document. A party relying on a written contract must prove its existence, and obviously oral evidence by or for him is admissible for that purpose. It follows that the other party to the case may in turn, by oral evidence, prove facts that show the written document did not constitute a contract at all‚Äîfor example, that it was forged. As regards the contents or terms of the written agreement, however, there is a very definite rule of law, known as the parol evidence rule, which places strict limits on the evidence that may be adduced in aid of interpretation. The rule dictates that, where the parties intended their agreement to be fully and finally embodied in writing, evidence to contradict or vary the terms of the writing, or to add to or subtract from them, is inadmissible. No evidence to prove the terms maybe given save the document itself (or, if it is lost, secondary evidence of its contents), nor may the contents of the document be contradicted, altered, added to or varied by parol or oral evidence, relating to what passed between the parties either before the written instrument was made or during its preparation. Where the parties have decided that a contract should be recorded in writing, their decision must be respected and the resulting document accepted as the sole evidence of the terms of the contract. The document itself, in other words, discloses the obligations. From this it should be clear that the parol evidence rule applies only to written contracts. It does this by its very nature. The rule applies to all contracts in writing, whether or not the law requires that they be in writing to be valid. Further, the rule applies not only to express terms (terms actually in the written contract), but also to terms implied by law. For example, where land is sold, an obligation to pay the costs of transfer is, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, imposed by law on the seller. It follows that, if a written contract of sale of land makes no reference to the costs of transfer, the seller is not allowed to give evidence of an alleged prior agreement with the purchaser that the latter is to pay these costs. The rule is generally binding only on the parties to the contract, not on third persons, for the latter may normally lead evidence to contradict or vary the contents of the contract. When, however, the issue in dispute (even between third parties) is what the obligations of the contracting parties to one another are, and those obligations are stated in a written contract, the integration rule is applicable. It must be noted that the rule does not apply to oral agreements made after the written document was completed. Consequently, evidence may be given of a subsequent oral agreement altering or cancelling the written agreement, except where the contract is required by statute to be in writing, for such a contract cannot be varied by a later oral agreement, though it may be cancelled by such an agreement. Similarly, where the contract itself provides that it can be varied only in writing an oral variation is void, and so too, it seems, is an oral agreement to cancel the contract. The rule excluding oral evidence derives not from the Roman-Dutch law, but from the English law of evidence, which has been adopted throughout South Africa by legislation. Because it places strict limits on the evidence that may be adduced in aid of interpretation, the rule forms a background to all interpretation. It often operates to prevent the leading of valuable evidence, but, for all its difficulties, it serves the purpose of ensuring that, where the parties have decided that a contract should be recorded in writing, their decision will be honoured and the resulting document accepted as the sole evidence of its terms. Union Government v Vianini Ferro-Concrete Pipes1941 AD 43. is the leading case here: > Now this Court has accepted the rule that when a contract has been reduced > to writing, the writing is, in general, regarded as the exclusive memorial > of the transaction and in a suit between the parties no evidence to prove > its terms may be given save the document of secondary evidence of its > contents, nor may the contents of such document be contradicted, altered, > added to or varied by parol evidence.47. Evidence of earlier negotiations, for example, is usually inadmissible. This aspect of the rule, which is the background to all the other rules of interpretation, is known as the integration rule.Du Plessis, et al. p.255.  Integration rule  \\"It is clear to me,\\" wrote Corbett JA in Johnston v Leal,1980 (3) SA 927 (A). > that the aim and effect of this rule is to prevent a party to a contract > that has been integrated into a single and complete written memorial from > seeking to contradict, add to or modify the writing by reference to > extrinsic evidence and in that way to redefine the terms of the contract. > The object of the party seeking to adduce such extrinsic evidence is usually > to enforce the contract as redefined or, at any rate, to rely upon the > contractual force of the additional or varied terms, as established by the > extrinsic evidence.943B-C. The integretation aspect of the parole evidence rule therefore \\"defines the limits of the contract.\\"943. The parties have \\"integrated\\" their negotiations into a single document, which should be regarded as the complete and final expression of their will: an \\"exclusive memorial\\" of their agreement.Du Plessis, et al. p.256. The purpose of this rule is to prevent a party from claiming other than what is provided for in the document. In Le Riche v Hamman,1946 AD 648. for example, Hamman sued to transfer one Victory Hill, which had been sold to Le Riche in error. Le Riche relied on oral evidence, but the parol evidence rule dictates that the court look first at the ordinary meaning of the contract. As this was clear and unambiguous, and did not, in its description of the land, refer to Victory Hill, Le Riche was unsuccessful. Whether the document amounts to an integration of the agreement depends on whether the parties intended it to be the exclusive record thereof. The extrinsic evidence is excluded because it relates to matters that, by reason of the reduction of the contract to writing and its integration in a single memorial, have become legally immaterial or irrelevant. The parol evidence rule is inapplicable when the question before the court is whether or not the parties actually intended to draw up an exclusive memorial in the first place,Where there is a problem with the foundation of the contract, the courts must resolve this before attempting to interpret the contract. and when it is apparent that a written document was not so intended; indeed, the rule applies only to written contracts, and comes into play only once everyone is satisfied that a contract actually exists. Furthermore, the rule does not apply if the document in question represents only one part of the contract, or if the contract is partly written and partly oral, which is the same as saying that the document was not intended, as it must, to be the whole body of the contract. It must apply to the contract in its entirety. The rule is also inapplicable when: * A written proposal, instead of being accepted simpliciter (which would bring the rule into operation), is orally modified before its acceptance * A written contract is modified by a subsequent oral or written agreement between the parties, so that they no longer intend it to embody their whole contract The integration rule is only a backstop, however; it comes into operation in the absence of some more dominant rule. It does not operate when an aggrieved party alleges fraud, misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence, duress or illegality, as in such cases the problem is with the foundation of the document, not with its interpretation. Although the integration rule does not exclude evidence of any subsequent oral agreement,Johnston v Leal 938G. a non-variation clause may be deployed to forestall such a thing.Non-variation clauses provide that no variation of a written contract has effect unless reduced to writing (Du Plessis, et al. p.163). Nor does the rule prevent the leading of evidence to show that the written document was subject to a precedent condition not expressed in the document, provided the condition is a true condition which suspends the operation of the contract without varying any of its terms.  Where the rule excluding oral evidence does not apply  Since the rule excluding oral evidence applies only to evidence that varies terms or contents of the written document, it follows that oral evidence is admissible that does not vary or modify the terms: namely, evidence that relates to: * The existence or validity of the written contract * Explanation of its terms * Collateral agreements not inconsistent with the written contract = Oral evidence relating to the existence or validity of the contract = Oral evidence may be given to the effect that the written document did not in fact constitute a contract at all: for example that: * The document was not intended by the parties to be binding on them, but that it was a blind to deceive other persons, and that the real contract was a prior oral agreement. * There was a prior oral agreement constituting a condition precedent to the contract's coming into effect, and that it had not been fulfilled. * The contract was void on the ground of mistake, illegality impossibility or lack of consensus. * It was voidable, for instance, on the ground of incapacity of one of the parties, or on the ground of misrepresentation. * The contract was subject to rectification by the court on the ground that, owing to a mistake, a term or condition had either been incorrectly inserted or described in the written contract, or had been omitted from it. * The contract had been entered into on the basis of a common, false supposition. Evidence may also be given of a prior verbal discussion to determine whether a term imposing a particular obligation was implied. = Oral evidence to explain the terms of the contract = Extrinsic evidence is always admissible to show to what persons or things or matters the terms of a contract refer, when these facts cannot be determined from the document itself. In such a case the contract is not varied, but merely applied. Oral evidence may be given, therefore, * to identify persons or things referred to in the written document; * to explain technical expressions or phrases, or words used in a peculiar sense different from the ordinary meaning by reason either of special circumstances, or by virtue of trade usage (provided, it seems, that the usage is not inconsistent with the clear terms of the written document); or * to elucidate ambiguous expressions (those capable of more than one meaning, either in themselves or as used with their context); but not, apparently, where the language is clear and explicit, or where the meaning of the word is a matter of law. = Collateral agreements = Parol evidence is always admissible to show that the written contract is only part of the whole transaction, and that a separate oral agreement made at the same time was not incorporated in the written agreement‚Äîprovided that the oral agreement referred to a matter on which the document is silent, and is not inconsistent with the terms of the written contract. It follows in these circumstances that two contracts may be proved, the one written and the other oral. Evidence, therefore, may be given of: * An agreement for consideration additional to that mentioned in the written contract * A collateral inducement by which one of the parties was persuaded to enter into the contract, even if the written agreement is one required by the law to be in writing On the other hand, evidence of an oral agreement is not admissible if its terms are inconsistent with those of the written agreement‚Äîas, for example, where the acceptor of a bill of exchange alleges that the payee had orally agreed with him that he would be liable for the full amount of the bill. Similarly, where a deed of sale of land sets out the purchase price and also states that the land is sold without encumbrances, evidence is not admissible of a prior or contemporaneous oral agreement that the price was fixed at some other figure, or that the land was sold subject to a servitude. Likewise, where there are not two collateral agreements but one composite contract, a portion of which is written and the remainder oral, evidence may be led to prove the supplemental oral portion, provided it is clear that the parties did not intend the written portion to be the exclusive memorial of the entire agreement. In such a case, termed a ‚Äúpartial integration,‚Äù the integration rule merely prevents the admission of extrinsic evidence to contradict or vary the written portion of the agreement. The court may hear evidence of surrounding circumstances, including the negotiations of the parties, to determine whether they intended the written agreement to be an integration of their whole transaction or merely a partial integration.  Interpretation rule  The integration aspect of the parol evidence rule is supplemented by the interpretation rule, \\"which determines when and to what extent extrinsic evidence may be adduced to explain or affect the meaning of the words contained in a written contract.\\"Johnston v Leal 943A. In other words, it controls the kind of evidence that may be led to establish the meaning of contractual provisions. Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible: It is a general rule that no evidence may be led to alter the clear and unambiguous meaning of a contract, whether written or oral. When, therefore, the contract as written is lacking or incomplete, there is no problem with then referring to extrinsic evidence. This is not in conflict with the integration rule: > Where ex facie the document itself the contract appears to be incomplete, > the object of leading extrinsic evidence is not to contradict, add to or > modify the written document or to complete what is incomplete so that the > contract may be enforced thus completed, but merely to explain the lack of > completeness, to decide why the parties left blanks in a particular clause > and what the integration actually comprises, and in this way to determine > whether or not the document constitutes a valid and enforceable contract > [...]. Consequently, it does not seem to me that the admission of such > extrinsic evidence for this purpose [...] would be either contrary to the > substance of the integration rule or likely to defeat its objects.943C-E. Although necessary, the rule can lead to injustice if too rigorously applied by excluding evidence of what the parties really agreed. The courts try to prevent the rule's use as an engine of fraud by a party who knows full well that the written contract does not represent the full agreement. In the quest to exclude irrelevant evidence, the courts have historically drawn a distinction between background circumstances and surrounding circumstances, with the former being admissible and the latter usually not. Coopers & Lybrand v Bryant describes the \\"correct approach to the application of the 'golden rule' of interpretation after having ascertained the literal meaning of the word or phrase in question.\\"768A. This case should be read with Delmas Milling v Du Plessis,1955 (3) SA 447 (A). which cites the same three classes of evidence: = Textual context = The courts must have regard firstly (after determining the literal meaning) to \\"the context in which the word or phrase is used with its interrelation to the contract as a whole, including the nature and purpose of the contract.\\"Coopers & Lybrand 768A-B. If there be difficulty, even \\"serious difficulty,\\" it should \\"nevertheless be cleared up by linguistic treatment,\\" if this is possible.Delmas Milling 454F. While grammatical meaning is the starting point of interpretation, words depend by necessity for their meaning on the contract as a whole. An understanding of the meaning of individual words must be gained from the wording of the contract as a whole: \\"It is, in my view, an unrewarding and misleading exercise to seize on one word in a document, determine its more usual or ordinary meaning, and then, having done so, to seek to interpret the document in the light of the meaning so ascribed to that word.\\"List v Jungers 1979 (3) SA 106 (A).180. The next step, accordingly, is to interpret the wording of a contract in the context of other provisions in the document read as a whole: that is, the textual context. This is done to give effect to the contract, rather than to make it ineffectual. The words are to be construed in their extended context: One may point to one of several \\"ordinary\\" meanings, or to an unusual or technical meaning. = Broader context = If, then, the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, or if any uncertainty that may exist can be resolved satisfactorily by linguistic treatment, evidence of ‚Äúsurrounding circumstances‚Äù‚Äîthat is to say, ‚Äúmatters that were probably present to the minds of the parties when they contracted‚Äù‚Äîis unnecessary and therefore inadmissible: cum in verba nulla ambiguitas est, non debet admitti voluntatis quaestio. If intra-textual treatment does not clearly yield the intention of the parties, the interpreter must look to the extended context to draw useful inferences from the nature of the contract, its purpose and the background against which it was concluded. In other words, only if a consideration of the language in its contextual setting fails to produce sufficient certainty (the degree of certainty required being left to the discretion of the individual judge) may evidence of ‚Äúsurrounding circumstances‚Äù be led. Even then, however, recourse may not be had to evidence of what passed between the parties in the course of negotiating the contract unless a consideration of the ‚Äúsurrounding circumstances‚Äù fails to resolve the difficulty. If the problem cannot be sorted out with reference to the language, a court may be informed of the background circumstances under which the contract was concluded. These are matters of an uncontentious nature, such as the relationship in which the parties stood to one another at the time of contracting, which may help to explain the context of the contract. They convey \\"the genesis and purpose of the contract, i.e. [...] matters probably present to the minds of the parties when they contracted,\\"Coopers & Lybrand 768B. but not the actual negotiations and similar statements.Delmas Milling 454G. The sole purpose of such evidence, it is still said, is to enable the court to understand the broad context in which the words requiring interpretation were used. Although \\"it is commonly said that the Court is entitled to be informed of all such circumstances in all cases,\\"454H this does not permit it to arrive at a different interpretation if the meaning is already clear from the words themselves. = Surrounding circumstances = Finally, but only \\"when the language of the document is on the face of it ambiguous,\\"Coopers & Lybrand 768C-D. and its meaning therefore uncertain,Cinema City v Morgenstern Family Estates 1980 (1) SA 796 (A).800H. the courts may consider surrounding circumstances: \\"what passed between the parties during the negotiations that preceded the conclusion of the agreement.\\"Engelbrecht v Senwes 2007 (3) SA 29 (SCA).Para 7. These include \\"previous negotiations and correspondence between the parties, [and] subsequent conduct of the parties showing the sense in which they acted on the document, save direct evidence of their own intentions\\"768D. (by which is meant actual negotiations between the parties). Where even the use of surrounding circumstances does not provide \\"sufficient certainty\\"‚Äîwhere, that is, there is ambiguity in the narrow sense‚Äîand there is still no substantial balance in favour of one meaning over another; where, in other words, the case is one \\"of 'ambiguity' as opposed to mere 'uncertainty,'\\"Cinema City v Morgenstern Family Estates. then \\"recourse may be had to what passed between the parties on the subject of the contract.\\"Delmas Milling 455B. The court may also refer to evidence of the parties' negotiations: the way they acted in carrying the contract out. The court should use outside evidence as conservatively as possible, but use it if necessary to reach what seems to be sufficient certainty as to the meaning. The court is still not allowed, however, to hear evidence as to what the parties subjectively thought the disputed term meant.  Criticism  The golden rule of interpretation, together with the principles reflected in Delmas, has in recent years endured much criticism.Du Plessis, et al. p.259.Lewis \\"Demise.\\"KPMG v Securefin 2009 (4) SA 399 (SCA) para 39.Kerr 220-223. The trend, in recognition of this, has been to erode the influence of the parol-evidence rule, admitting rather more kinds of evidence than fewer, although the practice of allowing all evidence has been also been criticised.KPMG v Securefin para 38. No court, yet, has gone so far as to overturn Delmas‚Äîjudges usually confine their disapproval to obiter dicta‚Äîbut it remains the case that the rules of interpretation in the South African law of contract are themselves hard to interpret, so that it falls to the particular views of each individual judge. = Too literal = The contention is made that so literalist an approach overlooks the fact that language may be imprecise, with no single meaning. The contention that words are always susceptible to one clear meaning is doubious. If this were the case, there would very rarely be the need to approach the court to interpret them. = Too hierarchical = The hierarchical nature of the exercise has also been criticised. While its rigid procedures may look good on paper, moving progressively, until a solution is found, through all the options available, in practice it is difficult to apply in court; indeed, the courts very rarely follow it, as it extends proceedings unnecessarily; instead the whole exercise is usually integrated, with counsel leading as much evidence as possible. There is, therefore, a clear disconnect between theory and practice in this area of the law, although judicial support has been expressed for a more liberal approach to interpretation. The oft-quoted assertion that ‚Äúthe rule of interpretation is to ascertain, not what the parties‚Äô intention was, but what the language used in the contract means, i.e. what their intention was as expressed in the contract,‚Äù has been treated very circumspectly. The principle tends to obscure the consensual basis of the South Africa law of contract, it is said, and is not inflexible, but subject to qualification. The words employed in a contract cannot be viewed in isolation, divorced from the matrix of facts in which they are set, if the intention of the parties is to be ascertained. While the first step in construing a contract is still to ascertain the ordinary, grammatical meaning of the words used, ‚Äúit should be recognised that very few words have a single meaning, and even the ‚Äòordinary‚Äô meaning of a word may vary according to, or be qualified by, the factual context in which it is used.‚ÄùHutchison and Du Bois ‚ÄúContracts‚Äù 802. A court should therefore be alive to the various possible meanings of the words, and should not approach the matter on the basis that a particular meaning predominates. It should also have regard to the nature and purpose of the contract, as well as the context of the words in the contract as a whole. = Terminologically confusing = Clearly the line between such ‚Äúbackground circumstances‚Äù and other ‚Äúsurrounding circumstances‚Äù is a fine one. It has been contended, indeed, that the distinction between background and surrounding circumstances is imprecisely drawn. \\"Perhaps,\\" as Lewis AJA put it in Van der Westhuizen v Arnold, \\"it is a distinction without a difference.\\"Para 23. It is clear that \\"background circumstances\\" are always admissible, whereas \\"surrounding circumstances\\" are admissible only when linguistic treatment is unsuccessful: that is, where ambiguity exists. It is unclear, however, what separates them in substance. Background circumstances are \\"matters probably present to the minds of the parties when they contracted,\\" while surrounding circumstances have been defined as \\"what passed between the parties during the negotiations that preceded the conclusion of the agreement.\\"Engelbrecht v Senwes para 7. It stands to reason, though, that \\"what passed between the parties during the negotiations that preceded the conclusion of the agreement\\" very often includes \\"matters probably present to the minds of the parties when they contracted.\\" So difficult has it proven in practice to separate them that \\"no- one knows precisely what the dividing line between the two categories is.\\" The whole procedure has been \\"bedvilled by the haziness,\\" and the future utility of the distinction is questioned. The question was raised as far back as 1979, in Cinema City v Morgenstern Family Estates, \\"whether the stage of development has been reached where the 'open sesame' of uncertainty may be dispensed with as a prerequisite to opening the door to evidence of surrounding circumstances, in either a limited or wider sense.\\" This would have gone some way toward eliminating the background-surrounding differentiation. The court found, though, that it was \\"unnecessary to express any opinion\\" on the matter for the purposes of that case.805H. The question is now being asked, ‚Äúpertinently,‚Äù why evidence of ‚Äúsurrounding circumstances‚Äù should not be admissible in all cases, if the goal is to place the court as near as may be in the situation of the parties to the instrument. Such an approach would be ‚Äúless artificial, more logical, consistent with modern thinking on the meaning of language, and would avoid the danger of a court enforcing a term in a contract to which neither party subscribed.‚ÄùHutchison and Du Bois ‚ÄúContracts‚Äù 803. No court yet has gone so far as to rescind the Delmas paradigm. The courts continue to profess allegiance to the traditional approach. Nevertheless, an apparently more liberal attitude to the admission of evidence of contextual facts, however classified, as well as a growing emphasis on purposive interpretation, ‚Äúherald a more flexible and sensible approach in practice.‚Äù The strongest judicial attack on Delmas to date was launched by Harms DP in KPMG v Securefin: > The integration (or parol evidence) rule remains part of our law. However, > it is frequently ignored by practitioners and seldom enforced by trial > courts [...]. The time has arrived for us to accept that there is no merit > in trying to distinguish between \\"background circumstances\\" and 'surrounding > circumstances\\". The distinction is artificial and, in addition, both terms > are vague and confusing. Consequently, everything tends to be admitted. The > terms \\"context\\" or \\"factual matrix\\" ought to suffice.Para 39. This obiter dictum has been read as effectively heralding a new era in the interpretation of contracts in South Africa, suggesting that the Supreme Court of Appeal will abandon the distinction \\"as soon as it is presented with an opportunity to do so.\\"Du Plessis, et al. p.257.  Circumventing the parole evidence rule  A litigant can circumvent the parol evidence rule by alleging a tacit term or by applying for rectification. Evidence relevant to such an allegation or application then becomes admissible, although it would have been inadmissible for the purposes of interpreting a written term of the contract. = Rectification = Rectification is a process that allows a party, under certain conditions, to amend the contents of the original document to reflect the original common intention. One may bring to this process extrinsic evidence, including negotiations, to convince the court to order the document's rectification. In cases where the contract must be written in order to exist, the parol evidence rule applies. Although this would suggest that the document cannot be rectified by order of court, the case of Meyer v Merchants Trust,1942 AD 244. where such a document was rectified, shows that it can. The offending clause in that case read as follows: > I do hereby bind myself as surety [...] for the payment of all monies which > may be owing by Gabbe & Meyer to their creditors [...] provided that the > total amount recoverable from me notwithstanding the amount that may be > owing by Gabbe & Meyer shall not exceed 250 pounds. The typist had left out the word's homoeoteleuton. There was accordingly an attempt to claim rectification on the basis of the misrecording. The bank contended that this was not possible, because surety agreements, always and necessarily written, cannot be rectified. The Appellate Division disagreed. = Canons of construction = Where the meaning of a contract remains unclear despite application of the primary rules (whereby the court establishes the intention of the parties by considering the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words in their textual and extra-textual context), the courts use various further canons of construction.  Secondary rules of interpretation  Secondary rules include rules or presumptions: * Against tautology or superfluity, such that, when examining a contract, its every word is seen to have relevance and purpose * That, in the case of two similar written contracts, a deliberate change in expression or language in the second, where it is drafted with the first in mind, should be taken prima facie to import a change of intention * That written or typed insertions in a printed agreement are interpreted as a more accurate reflection of the parties' intention than the printed terms, since these were deliberately selected by the parties themselves for the expression of their intention * That inconvenience ought to be avoided, in favour of constructions that lead to less of it, and in accordance with the dictates of commercial efficiency * That greater weight should be given to special provisions than to general ones (generalia specialibus non derogant); * That, when words with a general meaning are used in association with words relating to a species of a particular class, the general word is restricted in meaning to the same class as the specific words (the eiusdem generis or noscitur a sociis rule) * That, if a later provision qualifies an earlier provision, effect is to be given to the later qualifications;The same rule applies where the contract is contained in more than one document. * That, in the same vein, words are known or understood by the company they keep (noscitur a sociis), so that they should be read in their context, not in isolation * That preambles are subordinate to the operative part of a contract if they are sufficiently clear * That, where the language of the contract or a term is ambiguous‚Äîwhere, in other words, it is capable of more than one meaning‚Äîthe court place the construction on it that upholds the contract, rather than one that makes it illegal and void (interpretatio chartarum benigne facienda est ut res magis valeat quam pereat);For example, an ambiguous provision in a contract purporting to be in restraint of trade has been construed as being in favour of freedom of trade. * That, where the terms of a contract are ambiguous or vague, but the conduct of the parties shows that they have both given the same meaning to the words used, the court gives effect to that meaning;Even if a word has a plain and ordinary meaning, but the parties at the time the contract was made both understood it to have a different meaning, the latter meaning is binding on them, although not on innocent third persons. The parties would, in such a case, be entitled to rectification of the written document. * That the parties intended their contract to be legal rather than illegal; * That, when a contract is ambiguous, the principle that all contracts are governed by good faith means that the intention of the parties is determined on the basis that they negotiated in good faith;South African Forestry Co Ltd v York Timbers Ltd para 32. * That the parties intended their contract to have a fair result, although the unambiguous wording of a contract must not be departed from on equitable grounds, which has the paradoxical effect of ensuring that the courts do not in the interpretative process give one of the parties an unfair or unreasonable advantage over the other; and * Against the implication of a term when an express term already covers the relevant ground (expressio unius est exclusio alterius, or expressum facit cessare taciturn). Where special mention is made of a particular thing or obligation, some other thing or obligation otherwise normally be implied in the circumstances is excluded. Express mention of one item indicates an intention to treat differently items of a similar nature that have not been mentioned. A lease agreement that forbids the tenant to fish in the dam may generally be taken to mean that he may fish in the river. On the other hand, a lease that tells him he may not cut down the gum trees on the property does not thereby entitle him to fell the oaks, the gum trees having been mentioned ex abundanti cautela.  Tertiary rules of interpretation  As a last resort, the courts may use tertiary rules of interpretation. The goal here, a divergence from prior procedure, is rather to set up a fair outcome than to give effect to the parties‚Äô common intention. These tertiary rules include * the quod minimum rule, which states that ambiguous words must be narrowly interpreted, so as to encumber a debtor or promisor as little as possible; * the contra stipulatorem rule, which states that a clause, in case of doubt, is interpreted against the person who stipulates for something (the creditor), and in favour of the promisor or debtor (in stipulationibus cum quaeritur quid actum sit, verba contra stipulatorem interpretanda sunt), the point being to limit the operation of the stipulation and to burden the debtor as little as possible; and * the contra proferentem rule, which states that ambiguous terms of a contract are to be interpreted against the party who proposed them. The proferens is the party to the contract who is responsible, either himself or through an agent, for the wording of the ambiguous contract. The reasoning is simply that, if the wording is ambiguous, its author should be the one to suffer, as he had it in his power to make his meaning plain. The ambiguity is presumed to be due to his negligence in not having expressed himself more clearly when it was in his power to do so (verba fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem). Thus, where an insurance company frames a question that can have two reasonable meanings, the court adopts the one more favourable to the insured person. The contra stipulatorem rule rests on the same basis as the contra proferentem rule, for the stipulator (promissee) was the person responsible for couching the stipulation in whatever language she chose. These rules ‚Äòreflect a normative commitment grounded in fairness and good faith rather than a search for the parties‚Äô intentions‚Äô.Hutchison and Du Bois ‚ÄúContracts‚Äù 805. Similarly, an interpretation putting an equitable construction on ambiguous words is favoured. A court will not adopt a meaning that gives one party an unfair advantage over the other. The courts also seek to safeguard common-law values and principles. Moreover, due regard must be had to any possible implication the Constitution might have.  When all rules are exhausted  If a court, having gone through all the rules of interpretation, is still unable to give meaning to the contract (in which case it must have been too poorly written to admit of any interpretation), it is declared void for vagueness. = Disclaimers, indemnities and exemption clauses = In the interpretation of disclaimers, indemnities and exemption clauses, the courts give effect to language that exempts the proferens from liability in express and unambiguous terms. If, however, there is ambiguity, the language is construed against the proferens‚Äîbut a court must not adopt a strained or forced meaning in order to import some ambiguity. = Subjective versus objective = South African law seems to be moving from a relatively objective approach to interpretation, with a correspondingly restrictive attitude to admissibility of evidence, to one that is more subjective: that is, one whose aim is to discover what the parties subjectively intended.  Breach of contract  A breach of contract occurs, generally, when a party to the contract, without lawful excuse, fails to honour his obligations under the contract. = Forms of breach = Although South Africa recognises a general concept of breach, specific recognised forms include: * Ordinary breach; * Mora, which comprises ** Mora debitoris ** Mora creditoris * Repudiation * Prevention of performance Repudiation and prevention of performance are forms of anticipatory breach, since both can be committed prior to the stipulated time for performance. Liability for breach of contract is distinct from liability in delict, and fault is not a general requirement for the recovery of damages for breach of contract. A contract may, of course, create an obligation to exercise care or to act without negligence, but the breach of such an obligation does not per se constitute a delict; it only amounts to a delict where the conduct independently constitutes a delict, irrespective of the contractual obligation.  POSITIVE MALPERFORMANCE  Ordinary breach (or positive malperformance) relates to the content and quality of the performance made. In the formulation of AJ Kerr, \\"If without lawful excuse a party fails to do what he has contracted to do, or does what he has contracted not to do, an ordinary breach of contract is said to have occurred.\\"Kerr 601. This is breach in its starkest, most commonsensical form: essentially a failure to comply with the terms of a contract. All terms are susceptible to breach; in other words, both positive and negative obligations can be breached. There are two requirements for ordinary breach in the case of a positive obligation: # There must have been some performance; the debtor must in fact have performed. # The performance must, however, be incomplete or defective. In Holmdene Brickworks v Roberts Construction,1977 (3) SA 670 (A). the respondent, a building and engineering company in need of bricks for certain walls of a building it was constructing, entered into a supply contract with the appellant. Shortly after construction was completed, Holmdene's bricks \\"were beginning to crumble and decompose,\\"675B. manifesting a condition known as \\"efflorescence,\\" which threatened the stability of the entire edifice. The affected walls had to be demolished. Roberts sued successfully for consequential damages arising out of the breach. Where the debtor has a negative obligation, positive malperformance occurs when the debtor does the act he is bound to refrain from doing.It is unclear, but irrelevant, whether or not fault is an element of positive malperformance; it is assumed. The usual remedies are available. Where damages are awarded in lieu of the performance, or to complete it, they are known as ‚Äúsurrogate damages,‚Äù as opposed to other consequential damages. In the case of the positive malperformance of a negative obligation, the creditor is also entitled to apply for an interdict to restrain the debtor.  Mora  Mora is best defined as \\"delay without lawful excuse of the performance of a contractual duty or a wrongful failure to perform timeously.\\"Mulligan 276. It relates, then, to the time of the performance, specifically to the failure to meet it, and is for this reason sometimes referred to as ‚Äúnegative malperformance.‚Äù = Mora debitoris = Mora debitoris is the culpable failure of a debtor to make timeous performance of a positive obligation. There are five requirements: # The debt must be due and enforceable. The creditor must have a valid right to claim performance forthwith, against which the debtor can raise no valid defence, such as prescription, non-fulfilment of a suspensive condition, or the exceptio non adimpleti contractus. # The performance must have been fixed for a particular time, either in the contract or by way of a subsequent demand for performance. The mere fact that the debt is due does not mean that failure to perform constitutes mora, since timeous performance presupposes certainty as to the time for performance. The debtor can fall into mora only when a definite time for performance has been fixed, either in the contract itself (mora ex re) or by the creditor subsequently making a demand (interpellatio) on the debtor to perform by a specific date that is reasonable in the circumstances (mora ex persona). # The debt must (in spite of the failure as yet to perform) still capable of performance, since otherwise the breach consists in rendering performance impossible. # The delay must be the debtor's fault. It must be his responsibility, not out of his control. If, for example, performance was rendered temporarily impossible by vis major or casus fortuitus, or if the debtor could not reasonably have been expected to know that he had to perform, or how much to perform, there is no mora. (If, however, a debtor has guaranteed timeous performance, absence of fault does not prevent him from falling into mora.) The onus of proving the absence of fault rests on the debtor. # The debtor must have not yet have performed. The consequences of mora debitoris are threefold. First, supervening impossibility of performance, which is not due to the fault of either party, does not terminate the contract, contrary to the normal rule, unless the debtor can show that, even if he had performed timeously, the same fate would have befallen the prestation in the hands of the creditor (perpetuatio obligationis). In the special case of the contract of sale, this rule has the effect that the risk of destruction passes back to the seller who is in mora. Secondly, as in all cases of breach, the innocent party is entitled to contractual damages for any loss sustained as a result of the mora, irrespective of whether he can or does rescind the contract. Thirdly, the creditor may cancel the contract if ‚Äòtime was of the essence of the contract, or was made so by a notice of rescission‚Äô. Time is of the essence when the parties expressly or impliedly agreed that default of performance by the day fixed would entitle the other party to cancel the contract. An express clause to this effect is known as a lex commissoria. Even in the absence of such a clause, however, the circumstances often show that the parties regard the time for performance as being of the essence of the contract: for example, where they use precise language in fixing the time, or deliberately alter the date fixed in the original draft of the contract. Time is generally of the essence of a contract in mercantile transactions, particularly in respect of commodities that fluctuate in value, but not as a rule in transactions concerning land. In all cases, however, the decisive test is the intention of the parties. Where time is not of the essence, the creditor may make it so by sending to the debtor a ‚Äònotice of rescission‚Äô, informing him that, if he does not perform by the agreed date, or by a date fixed in the notice, the creditor may cancel the contract. The time stipulated for performance must be reasonable, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case. The notice must be clear and unequivocal. Where the time for performance was not fixed in the contract itself, both a demand for performance (interpellatio) and a notice of rescission are necessary to allow cancellation for non- performance, though both may be, and usually are, contained in the same document. The time element, for obvious reasons the most crucial element of mora, depends on whether it is mora ex re or mora ex persona.  Mora ex re  Where the parties have fixed in their contract a time for performance, either expressly or by necessary implication, a culpable failure by the debtor to perform on or before the due date automatically places him in mora ex re, without the need for any intervention on the part of the creditor. There are three contingencies: # The time is fixed expressly in the contract‚Äîfor example, ‚Äòperformance falls due within ten days‚Äô‚Äîin which case, as soon as it lapses, the debtor is in mora. # The time is fixed by necessary implication. If one purchased a ticket for the opening ceremony of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the ticket would obviously have to be issued before the start of the ceremony. The standard is set out pithily by Colman J in Broderick Properties v Rood, where ‚Äòno time for performance was expressly stipulated in the contract but by necessary implication it can be shown that performance by some specific time was intended, and was essential‚Äô. # Finally, it may be implied that performance is to occur immediately, in which case the creditor need not make any demand for it. If a geyser bursts, and one contracts a plumber to repair it, the implication is that the plumber must set about his work immediately, not at some distant date in the future.  Mora ex persona  The standard for mora ex re is easier to meet than that for its counterpart. Where no time for the performance has been stipulated in the contract, or is necessarily implied by it, the creditor must himself place the debtor in mora ex persona. This he does by demanding performance on or before a definite date or time that is reasonable in the circumstances. There is no mora until this has been done. The onus is on the debtor to show that the time or date in question is unreasonable. For example, a property developer contracts an agent to find him a designer for a golf course he wishes to build, but does not give a specific time for the completion of this task; it is an open agreement. Only when the developer has given a specific date for performance is the agent in mora (for failing to perform by that date). In Willowdene Landowners v St Martin's Trust,1971 (1) SA 302 (T). the court addressed the question of how it is ascertained that the creditor's demand gave the debtor reasonable time to perform. Although it was noted that the reasonableness of the demand depends on the facts of each case, three broad questions must be considered: # What was the intention of the parties? # What was the nature of the performance due? # Did the debtor perform, as he should have, with due diligence? Mora ex persona requires an interpellatio to fix the date of performance. An interpellatio is a demand added or appended to the contract after the fact. It is extrajudicial, and may be verbal or written, but it is usually made in a letter of demand, beginning with the words ‚ÄòI am now putting you to terms...‚Äô The usual remedies, discussed more fully in the next section, apply for breach in the form of mora debitoris, namely: * Specific performance * Cancellation * Damages * Interest (as per the Prescribed Rate of Interest Act,Act 55 of 1975. currently set at 15.5 per cent per annum, or as agreed by the parties) One consequence shared by other forms of breach is that, if performance becomes impossible after a debtor has fallen into mora, the debtor is not excused from performance (a consequence known as perpetuatio obligationis or, literally, ‚Äòthe perpetuation of the obligation‚Äô). If a debtor is in mora, the creditor may rescind the contract if time is of the essence‚Äîwhich it is if: * There is an express or implied lex commissoria (forfeiture clause), to the effect that a failure to perform timeously entitles the creditor to cancel. * The creditor has made time of the essence by sending the debtor a notice of rescission. = Mora creditoris = Where the co-operation of the creditor is necessary to enable the debtor to perform his contractual obligation, the creditor is obliged so to co-operate. Mora creditoris is the culpable failure of a creditor (the person to whom the performance is owed) to cooperate timeously with the debtor to enable him to perform. The creditor must not have repudiated the contract or rendered performance by the debtor impossible; otherwise the breach renders performance impossible. Usually mora creditoris arises when the creditor is unavailable or inaccessible for the performance to be delivered, or if by some other means he delayed the performance. The requirements for mora creditoris are in many respects similar to those for mora debitoris. There are five conditions: # The debtor must be under an obligation to make the performance to the creditor, but the obligation need be neither enforceable nor due, since a debtor may discharge his debt before the due date for performance. # The debtor must take whatever steps towards performance that are possible without the creditor's co-operation before calling on the creditor to accept the performance. The performance offered by the debtor must be full, proper and perfect; otherwise the creditor is entitled to reject it and raise the exceptio non adimpleti contractus. # The cooperation of the creditor must have been necessary. There can be no question of mora creditoris, therefore, in respect of an obligation not to do something (obligatio non faciendi), since the cooperation of the creditor is not required in order that the debtor may refrain from acting. # The creditor must have failed to receive performance, or delayed in accepting it. Again, this presupposes a fixed time for performance. If no such time has been fixed in the contract, or if the debtor wishes to discharge his debt before the time fixed in the contract, he must notify the creditor of the time when he wishes to perform, allowing the creditor a reasonable opportunity to prepare to receive the performance. # The delay must have been the fault of the creditor. If it is occasioned by force majeure (vis major or casus fortuitus), for example, or if the creditor is entitled to reject the offered performance, there is no mora creditoris. If, for example, a lease contract contains a term that requires the tenant to pay rent in cash on the last day of each month at the landlord's residence, and there is no-one home when he does so, the above requirements have been met. There is, therefore, mora creditoris. The usual remedies for breach are available to the debtor. If the creditor is in mora, the risk of damage to contractual goods, caused by supervening impossibility and the debtor's negligence (short of gross negligence), passes to the creditor. Clearly, the debtor is entitled to damages for any loss he has suffered as a result of the mora, like the cost of storing merchandise or feeding animals he had to deliver. He may cancel the contract in the same circumstances as those in which the creditor may cancel for mora debitoris where time: * Is of the essence (because of an express or implied lex commissoria) * Has been made of the essence by the debtor's sending a notice of rescission that has been disregarded If the debtor elects to abide by the contract, he may in suitable circumstances obtain an order compelling the creditor to co-operate. His own duty to perform then of course remains, but the delay on his side does not constitute mora debitoris, being occasioned by the fault of the creditor. The debtor's duty of care in respect of the article to be delivered (where appropriate) is diminished. Once the creditor falls into mora, the debtor is liable only for dolus or culpa lata. Moreover, the principle of perpetuatio obligationis applies here in reverse: The creditor bears the risk of supervening impossibility of performance brought about fortuitously or by the debtor's culpa (provided such negligence is not gross, culpa lata). In the case of a reciprocal contract, the debtor may, despite his own incomplete or non-performance, claim counter-performance by the other party, who cannot raise the exceptio non adimpleti contractus, but the counter-performance is subject to reduction by the amount that the debtor saves by not fully performing on his side. Mora creditoris releases sureties, but its effect on the existence of a mortgage, pledge or lien is uncertain. The effect on the debtor's duty to pay interest or other compensation for the use of a thing is also unclear. Unless he cancels the contract, or obtains an order compelling the creditor to accept his performance, it is not clear how the debtor can discharge his debt without having to wait until the period of prescription has run, or until performance has become impossible. Consignation (payment into court with notice to the creditor) appears to have fallen into desuetude, and is in any event impossible or impracticable in many cases (as in the case where perishables are to be delivered). Whether the debtor may sell the goods for the account of the creditor is also uncertain. The details, then, are the same, mutatis mutandis, as for mora debitoris, which is much more common. Mora creditoris is a very rare form of breach, its value inhering mostly in its conceptual reflection of its opposite.  Repudiation  Repudiation is a party's demonstration, by words or conduct, and without lawful excuse, of an unequivocal intention no longer to be bound by the contract or by any obligation forming part of it. A deliberate breach of a single provision in a contract to which that provision is essential amounts to repudiation of the entire contract. There are two kinds of repudiation: # Ordinary repudiation occurs when the obligation is already owing, as in the case of an illegitimate claim (malifide) or a declaration that one cannot perform, or a denial that the contract is binding on the denier, or a denial of the existence of an obligation. # Anticipatory breach occurs when repudiation is made before the obligation comes due or in anticipation of an obligation to come. The intention to repudiate is judged objectively; it is not a question of whether or not, in the subjective sense, someone thinks he has repudiated the contract. The court will ask how a reasonable person would assess the actions of the alleged repudiating party. The test to be applied is whether or not that party acted in such a way as to lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that he did not intend to fulfill his part of the contract. The breach must be major to constitute repudiation, and the denial must be serious. It must deny a material obligation that goes to the heart of the agreement. As in all serious cases of breach, the innocent party has a choice of whether to rescind or to affirm the contract, and is relieved of his obligations in terms of the contract.  Prevention of performance  Where performance on either side becomes impossible due to the fault of one of the parties, the contract is not terminated, but the party who rendered performance impossible is guilty of prevention of performance. Objective impossibility is not necessary; the subjective variety suffices. Fault is not an essential element of this breach, unless the debtor has guaranteed the performance and the creditor is not at fault. The usual remedies, except for specific performance, are available to the creditor. In the case of material prevention of the performance of a divisible obligation, the creditor may only cancel pro tanto, and his counterperformance is reduced proportionately. This form of breach is very rare, in part because it is so often categorised under one of the other forms. It offers very little by way of case law, as such cases are, for the most part, easily settled.  Remedies for breach  Remedies for breach are aimed either at the fulfilment or at the rescission or cancellation of a contract. Full performance is the natural cause of termination of an agreement. Because breach interferes with proper fulfilment, the primary remedy is accordingly aimed at fulfilment. Cancellation is an extraordinary remedy. Remedies may be claimed as soon as the breach occurs. This is especially helpful in cases of anticipatory breach, as the claimant does not have to wait for the date when performance falls due. When breach occurs, the innocent party may generally either: * Uphold the contract and insist on its fulfilment, by claiming either specific performance or its financial equivalent :or * Rescind the contract, tender the return of the other party's performance and claim restitution of any performance already made by himself Parties to an agreement may agree on remedies in the event of breach. Such agreement then takes precedence in the application of remedies for breach. Three types of remedy are available: # Remedies aimed at enforcement (which include specific performance and the exceptio non adimpleti contractus) # Cancellation # Remedies aimed at compensation (which include damages and interest) Enforcement and cancellation are mutually exclusive remedies. Damages and interest are cumulative to other remedies. An innocent party may have alternative or additional claims in delict. = Remedies aimed at keeping the contract alive =  Specific performance  A claim for specific performance is the primary and obvious and most basic remedy for breach of contract, upholding as it does the expectation interest of the creditor: When one enters into a contract, one expects performance in terms of it. The South African approach is in this way quite contrary to English law,Benson v SA Mutual Life 1986 (1) SA 776 (A) at 779H. where damages are preferred, and where specific performance is a special discretionary remedy that may be sought only in certain circumstances.Benson v SA Mutual Life at 777A.Santos v Igesund 2003 (5) SA 73 (C) at 86H. A claim for specific performance may be for the payment of a sum of money (ad pecuniam solvendum), a claim for the performance of some positive act other than payment of money (ad factum praestandum) or a claim to enforce a negative obligation. The remedy of specific performance is not absolute and does not guarantee success. Even where it is shown that there has been a breach, the remedy is not granted unless the innocent party is ready to perform and performance is subjectively and objectively possible for the defendant. The courts have exercised an equitable discretion to refuse a claim for specific performance, usually on the grounds of impossibility, undue hardship or in claims for the enforcement of personal services. An order for specific performance is enforced in keeping with the ordinary rules of procedure. The cases of Benson v SA Mutual Life, Santos v Igesund and Haynes v King William's Town Municipality1951 (2) SA 371 (A). set out guidelines to be taken into consideration where the court is asked to grant specific performance. A court does not make an order for specific performance in cases where: * Performance is personal.Santos v Igesund. * There is a relative impossibility, where the specific person (an injured pop star, for example) cannot perform. * Because it would have to supervise its decree, it would be difficult for the court to enforce it. * The defendant is insolvent. * Performance would severely prejudice third parties. * It conflicts with public policy and would be inappropriate. * As in Haynes, the cost to the defendant in being compelled to perform is out proportion to the corresponding benefit to the plaintiff, and the latter can equally well be compensated by an award of damages, an order is not made for specific performance. (The hardship of the contract at the time of its concluded, then, is not decisive of the matter; it may also be judged of at the time performance is claimed.) The facts and circumstances of each case are determinative.  Exceptio non adimpleti contractus  The exceptio non adimpleti contractus is a defence raised against a contractual claim for specific performance. It may be used if the parties' obligations are reciprocal to one another, and if the other party is obliged to perform first (or simultaneously with the party raising the exceptio) but is in breach. The exceptio may also be used where that party has performed incompletely. Synallagmatic contracts are subject to the principle of reciprocity. In terms of this principle, a party is not entitled to claim performance of a reciprocal obligation from another party where the former has to perform his obligation first or simultaneously, unless he has already performed or is tendering performance of his obligation. If, in a basic example, Warne sells a car to Cullinan, and Cullinan has not the money to pay for it, Warne may refuse to hand over the car. In contracts of mandate, similarly, to a real- estate agent claiming commission before the sale of a house, one may deploy the exceptio to refute her claim for specific performance. Where the innocent party receives and starts using part-performance or defective performance, the contract cannot then be cancelled, as an election to keep the contract alive has been made, but the innocent party may raise the exceptio. Where the contract has been lawfully cancelled, the innocent party becomes liable to the breaching party for restitution of any performance received. In BK Tooling v Scope Precision Engineering, the court confirmed the principle of reciprocity: An incomplete performance can not be equated with due performance. This, however, is a very strict application of the exceptio and would be too harsh on the debtor. The court accepted partial performance in that case, setting out two questions for consideration: # Has the creditor used the incomplete performance? # Do special equitable circumstances exist (that is, mitigating factors that garner the court's sympathy)? In Thompson v Scholtz,1999 (1) SA 233 (SCA). the court could not apply the test in BK Tooling because the defective performance could not be repaired. To determine how to fix it, the court used the analogy of lease, with a remission of rental to award Thompson 75 per cent of his original claim. The courts, then, have exercised their discretion to relax the principle of reciprocity where a breaching party has made defective or part-performance, which the innocent party has nonetheless begun to use; and where the innocent party (using the exceptio) is refusing to pay until full performance is made. In these circumstances, a court may order the party making use of the defective or incomplete performance to pay a reduced amount to the party in breach. The onus to prove the amount of the reduction is on the breaching party. The exceptio non adimpleti contractus is available in all types of contract, but not where a breach is excused by law, or where the risk of defective performance lies with the party who wishes to raise the exceptio. = Cancellation = Cancellation, the consequence exclusively of a valid contract, cannot be claimed in all circumstances. It is an extraordinary remedy, available only if the breach is sufficiently serious or material‚Äîunless the parties have provided a cancellation clause (a lex commissoria) in the agreement, in which case the agreement takes precedence over common-law rules. If the breach is minor, and there is no lex commissoria, the innocent party can always rely on specific performance and claim for damages. If, in the absence of a lex commissoria, the breach is a major one, the court considers, in terms of common law, the nature of the breach. In Swartz & Son v Wolmaransstad1960 (2) SA 1 (T). the court examined the severity of the breach to ascertain whether or not it was indeed a major one. There is thus a need to interpret how important is the relevant clause to the contract. The courts take the value-judgment approach to show that there has been a breach. The test is > whether the breach 'goes to the root of the contract', or affects a 'vital > part' of the obligations or means that there is no 'substantial > performance'. It amounts to saying that the breach must be so serious that > it cannot reasonably be expected of the other party that he should continue > with the contract and content himself with an eventual claim for > damages.4F-G. In Strachan v Prinsloo,1925 TPD 709. the court held that: * To determine if the cancellation was justified, the test to apply was whether the plaintiff had failed to perform a vital term, express or implied, of the agreement. * An important factor in deciding whether such term was vital was the question whether the defendant would have entered into the agreement in the absence of such term. * The plaintiff had in fact failed to perform a vital term. * The defendant was therefore justified in terminating the agreement. A serious violation of duty by one partner, in other words, justifies the other in terminating the partnership. If an innocent party elects to cancel the contract, the other party must be notified of the decision. The election to cancel is a unilateral juristic act; it does not require a court order. If a court order is made, it merely confirms that the election was appropriate.Segal v Mazzur 1920 CPD 634. The notice of cancellation must be clear and unequivocal, and made within reasonable time. Once the decision is made, it is final. Although conduct may also be indicative of cancellation, the ideal is to communicate it expressly. If an innocent party expressly or tacitly manifests an intention to abide by the contract in spite the breach, the right to cancel on account of the breach is waived. Waiver and estoppel are two reasonable defences for cancellation. They may be based on past conduct or a previously-spoken or -written waiver of the right to cancel. Cancellation takes effect ex nunc (from that point onwards) when the other party is informed of it. Cancellation is in this way different from recission, which applies to voidable contracts ex tunc (from the beginning of the contract).  Consequences  The effect of cancelling a contract is that the primary and unexecuted obligations of the parties are extinguished. Accrued rights continue to be enforceable. Upon cancellation, each party is obliged reciprocally to restore whatever performance has been received‚Äîthat is, to make restitution‚Äîto the other party. If, for example, a lessor cancelled because the lessee had three months' rent owing, the lessor may still claim the rent outstanding.  Mora  A contract may be cancelled in light of mora where: * It contains a forfeiture clause * Time is of the essence, in which case delay constitutes a major breach Where time is not of the essence, a breach of time does not necessarily constitute a breach that allows the creditor to cancel. Once mora has occurred, the creditor is allowed to make time of the essence by serving notice of the right to rescind, after which he can cancel. This is not an interpellatio, which determines when mora, not cancellation, occurs. = Damages = Damages are a primary remedy for breach of contract: a claim to compensate for financial loss suffered as a result of the breach. Damages may be claimed in addition to other remedies. Their purpose, if they are positive-interest or expectation damages, is to place the innocent party in the position he would have occupied had the contract been properly performed (though the defaulting party is not liable for special consequences he could not have contemplated when he entered into the contract).Victoria Falls and Transvaal Power v Consolidated Langlaagte Mines 1915 AD 1. Negative-interest or reliance damages aim to place the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied had he not entered into the contract at all. Contractual damages may include both expectation and reliance losses. The requirements for a damages claim are: # A breach of contract by the defendant # Financial or patrimonial loss by the plaintiff, although it must be either damnum emergens (loss actually incurred because of the breach) or lucrum cessans (prospective damages or loss of profits that would, because of the breach, have been made in the future) # A factual causal link between the breach and the loss; and # Legal causation: The loss must not be too remote a consequence of the breach. In terms of the difference rule, a plaintiff's financial loss is determined by comparing the patrimonial position occupied after the breach with the hypothetical patrimonial position that would have been occupied had the contract been properly performed. A distinction is made between positive interesse, which applies to contractual damages, and negative interesse, which applies to delictual ones. As the court put it in Trotman v Edwick,1951 (1) SA 443 (A). > The litigant who sues on delict sues to recover a loss sustained because of > the wrongful conduct of another, in other words that the amount by which his > patrimony has been diminished by such conduct should be restored to him. The courts often use a more concrete approach to calculate damages in contractual cases, comparing the value that the specific asset or obligation would have had with its actual value after the breach (rather than on the patrimony as a whole). In terms of the market-value approach (where performance consists of marketable goods), the amount of damages is determined by the difference in the market value of the goods as received and the market value they would have had if the goods had conformed with the requirements of the contract. In terms of the once-and-for-all-rule, the plaintiff must claim all of his damages in one action. If not all of the loss has been suffered at the time the action is lodged, the plaintiff must include a claim for prospective losses in that action. Factual causation is established by means of the \\"but-for\\" (or conditio sine qua non) test. The test for legal causation asks whether the causal connection between the breach and the loss is sufficiently close to justify the imposition of liability. General damages are generally and objectively foreseeable as flowing from the type of breach and are thus not too remote and are recoverable. Special damages would not normally be expected to flow from the type of breach in question and are thus presumed to be too remote unless exceptional circumstances are present. In terms of the convention principle, special damages can be claimed where the parties entered into the contract on the basis of their knowledge of the special circumstances, and thus can be taken to have agreed that there would be liability for damages arising from such circumstances. An innocent party only needs to prove that a breach of contract was a cause of the loss, not that it was the dominant cause of the loss. There is no apportionment or reduction of damages where the plaintiff shares the fault for the loss. The mitigation rule, however, states that, where a breach of contract has occurred, the innocent party must take reasonable positive steps to prevent the occurrence of losses, or his claim may be reduced or eliminated. To provide quick and easily provable relief in the event of breach of contract, contracts often include penalty clauses or other similar clauses (pre- estimates of damages and forfeiture clauses). Clauses falling within the scope of the Conventional Penalties ActAct 15 of 1962. are enforceable but subject to reduction on equitable grounds. A penalty clause excludes a claim for damages. Interest that a creditor would have earned on an amount, had it been paid, is a loss that flows naturally from the breach and therefore constitutes damages that can be claimed. At common law, mora interest on a debt becomes payable from the date that a liquidated debt falls due. Where no date for payment is agreed, payment becomes due on demand from the creditor. In a claim for unliquidated damages, the debtor cannot be in mora until such time as the amount of damages has been fixed by a court. Interest is therefore only payable from the date of judgment. The Prescribed Rate of Interest ActAct 55 of 1975 now governs claims for the payment of interest. In terms of the Act, interest at the prescribed rate is payable on any debt that bears interest, unless the rate of interest is set in the contract or by a trade custom. The Act also provides for interest to run on unliquidated debts from the time of demand or summons, whichever is earlier. The amount on which the interest is calculated is the amount as finally determined by court or in arbitration. The Act also provides for payment of mora interest on judgment debts where such debts would ordinarily not be interest-bearing. Although it is possible and permitted to arrive at an independent interest rate in the contract, this is subject to the test of reasonableness. = Other remedies = Other remedies available in the case of breach include the interdict and the declaration of rights.  Interdict  An interdict is a court order that prohibits the respondent from doing some specified thing. It may be used as a form of specific performance, to protect ancillary rights, to prevent a threatened breach of contract and to prevent third-party intervention. The requirements to be met for the granting of an interdict are # A clear right # Injury # No other effective ordinary remedy  Declaration of rights  Where there is uncertainty about rights under a contract, usually in the context of a dispute, a party may approach the court for a declaratory order that binds all interested parties, who should therefore be joined.  Cession  Cession is a transfer of a personal incorporeal right or claim from the estate of the cedent (transferor) to that of the cessionary (transferee) by means of an agreement between the two; it is the substitution by contract, known as a cessionary agreement, of one creditor for another. It is the opposite, then, of delegation. For example, > Assume A has a right to claim money from B, arising from a contract or any > other source of obligation. A might sell that right to C. The sale of the > right is a contract, or obligationary agreement that obliges A to transfer > the right to C.The sale itself does not transfer the right; that is achieved > by cession, which in theory is a separate agreement entailing concurring > intentions: to transfer the right on A's part and to take transfer of it on > C's part.Du Plessis, et al. p.5. As a general rule, all claims can be ceded: contractual rights as well as delictual ones. Future rights, too, may be ceded, as was shown in FNB v Lynn.1996 (2) SA 339 (A). Logically speaking, the court noted there, a non- existent right of action or a non-existent debt cannot be transferred as the subject-matter of a cession.346C. The parties may agree in the obligationary agreement to cede to the cessionary a future or contingent right of action (spes futurae actionis), or a future or conditional debt (debitum futurum or conditionale) as and when it comes into existence and accrues or becomes due and payable, whereupon it is transferred to the cessionary. If it never comes into existence it amounts to a non-existent right of action or a non-existent debt, which cannot qualify as the subject-matter of a cession.346F-G. = Requirements = The following are requirements for a valid cession: * The cedent must have a primary claim against the debtor. * The cedent must be entitled to dispose of that personal right. * The personal right must be capable of cession. All claims are prima facie cessionable except: ** Claims subject to a pactum de non cedendo (an anti-cession clause); ** Where prohibited by law, as in the case of patent rights, workers' compensation,Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act 130 of 1993. pensioners‚Äô rights, and earnings of insolvents;Insolvency Act 24 of 1936. and ** Claims of an extremely personal nature, as per the delectus personae rule, for which the test is set out in Sasfin v Beukes:1989 (1) SA 1 (A). Would the debtor be indebted in a substantially different way as a result of the cession? If so, it cannot be accepted.Para 37. Examples of claims too personal to be ceded include claims for spousal maintenance, claims for pain and suffering under the actio iniuriarium, employment agreements, and partnership agreements. * A cession agreement must be concluded between the cedent and the cessionary, giving the latter causa for the ceded claim. * Both parties must have contractual capacity. * The formalities set by law or by the parties must be complied with. * The cession must not be prohibited by law, against public policy, or contra bonos mores.Sasfin v Beukes. * The cession should not prejudice the debtor. Cession may not split a claim against the debtor, so that he faces multiple actions; the claim must be ceded in toto. The only time a claim may be split is when it is with the debtor's consent. Although it is not necessary to give notice to the debtor of the fact of the cession, it is generally seen as advisable. If the debtor is unaware that his obligation is to a new creditor (i.e. the cessionary), he may still discharge his obligation to the cedent, in which case the cessionary loses his claim (although he may have an action for unjustified enrichment against the cedent). It is therefore usually in the cessionary's interest to serve the debtor with notice. A valid causa is not necessary for a valid cession, but it is a requirement for the cession to have a permanent effect. = Consequences = Cession transfers a claim from the estate of the cedent to that of the cessionary. This has a number of consequences: # The personal right now falls into the estate of the cessionary, whether he be liquid or insolvent. # The cessionary is the only person entitled to enforce, novate, delegate or set off the debt. The cedent may no longer claim from the debtor. # The rule nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse haberet applies to the cession of claims. The cedent cannot cede the same claim more than once; nor can he confer upon the cessionary any greater right than the cessionary has himself. The whole claim is transferred to the estate of the cessionary, together with all its benefits and privileges and disadvantages. # As a general rule, once the cession has taken place, the debtor can validly perform only towards the cessionary, because the cedent is no longer the creditor. The debtor is, however, released if he performs towards the original creditor (the cedent) in good faith and without knowledge of the cession. As observed above, it is generally thought prudent of the cessionary to serve notice of the cession on the debtor. # The debtor may raise against the cessionary any defence available to him that he would have had against the cedent. This is because the causa of this original obligation does not change. = Security cession = Cession in securitatem debiti is different from outright cession. It is designed to secure a debt, often a loan or overdraft facilities. The cedent does not fall out of the picture completely but retains what is known as a reversionary interest. In other words, once the loan is paid off, the rights revert to the cedent. The fiduciary security cession and the pledge are the two known forms of security cession. A security cession is interpreted as a pledge unless the parties make it clear that they wish their security cession to be in the form of the fiduciary cession. The fiduciary security cession is an ordinary cession of a personal right as security coupled with a fiduciary agreement, which is an ordinary contract. In a pledge of a personal right, the ownership of the personal right is retained by the cedent, while only quasi- possession is transferred to the cessionary (pledgee).  Termination of obligations  Obligations may be terminated upon full and proper performance, by agreement or by operation of law. = Termination by performance = Most contracts are not breached. The primary means of termination is by due and full and proper performance, which is usually rendered by the person on whom the duty to perform is imposed. The effect of proper performance or payment is to release the party concerned from his contractual obligation. Payment is the delivery of what is owed by a person competent to deliver to a person competent to receive. When made, it operates to discharge the obligation of the debtor. Proper performance of a party's obligation discharges not only that obligation but also any obligations accessory to it, such as contracts of suretyship and pledge.  By whom  The contract determines by whom performance should be made. Usually it is the person upon whom the obligation is imposed. In cases of delectus personae, there is no alternative performer; it is mandatory that that specific debtor perform. In the absence of delectus personae, performance could also be rendered by third parties, including: * An agent, appointed by the debtor to perform on his behalf * A surety (as per the previous section) * Another third party, either charitably or by agreement (which is to say, in the latter case, by delegation). This may be done even without the debtor's knowledge. It is important to note, however, that the third party is a stranger to the contract and is therefore not bound to perform; if he does not, it is the party who promised he would who is liable. The creditor is entitled to reject performance by a third party if it is not in the name of the debtor. A third party who performs in the name of the debtor is entitled to payment by the creditor of any security deposited or pledged by the debtor with the creditor, unless the third party pays as the debtor's agent. The creditor is not entitled to proceed against the third party, however, as there is no privity of contract between them.  To whom  As for the question of to whom performance must be made, there is a variety of possibilities. Depending on the circumstances, performance may be rendered to: * The creditor * The creditor's agent * Some third party indicated by the creditor, thereby producing a subsidiary contract (adiectus solutionis causa);This usually comes in the form of a unilateral instruction from the creditor: \\"You will pay so-and-so the following amount...\\" This usually occurs in the case of ongoing debts like monthly rent, paid into the landlord's bond. * A third party, the adiectus solutionis causa, agreed on by the original parties.This route, for obvious reasons, is generally more cordial than the previous one. It is established by way of a simple agreement, and is also far more practical, eliminating unnecessary steps. This party is entitled to receive performance. Hugo Grotius.  Time and place  The time and place of performance are usually stipulated in the contract. The first port of call, therefore, is to examine the contract and determine whether or not it stipulates a particular place for performance. If there is no specific stipulation, the type of contract generally determines the place for the requisite performance. In the law of sale, for instance, it is the buyer's obligation to fetch the item from the seller. Some obligations can only be fulfilled in a certain place, like the transfer of property, which occurs only at the Deeds Registry. If no date is stipulated, performance must occur \\"within a reasonable time,\\" to be determined, again, by the nature of the contract. Concrete Products v Natal Leather Industries1946 NPD 377. is the leading and most illustrative case on the determination of reasonable time. In that case, the plaintiff agreed to sell the defendant a large number of steel corners for suitcases in different sizes. The agreement provided that several thousand of each size were to be delivered every week, and that the order for small corners was to be regarded as urgent. No time for the commencement of delivery was fixed. The plaintiff failed to deliver the small corners despite the defendant's insistence that the contract be carried out. He did, however, dispatch medium corners, which were accepted by the defendant in terms of the contract. As a result of the non-delivery of the small corners, the defendant, about three weeks after the date of the contract, notified the plaintiff of its cancellation.  Nature  = Performance = As for what constitutes performance, the case of BK Tooling v Scope Precision Engineering,1979 (1) SA 391 (A). with its review of the principle of reciprocity and the exceptio non adimpleti contractus, sets out several clear requirements:433. In reciprocal contracts, a creditor has the right to receive full and complete performance. There must be strict compliance, in other words: 100 per cent performance. The principle of reciprocity recognises that in many contracts the common intention of the parties, expressed or unexpressed, is that there should be an exchange of performances. The creditor, therefore, may refuse any vaguely inappropriate performance. Part performance is not performance. The strict legal position is that, if a builder, say, should complete only half the contracted construction, and then sue for payment, the other party is entitled to deploy the exceptio. Because part performance is not performance, no payment is owed. Importantly, though, the defendant only succeeds with the exceptio if the plaintiff's performance fell due prior to or simultaneously with the performance claimed from the defendant. The courts reserve for themselves a discretion to depart from the strict legal position, and sometimes award reduced counterperformance to the plaintiff, in which case it is up to the debtor to prove what the reduced fee should be. (The usual test to subtract the cost of rectifying the problem or defect or shortcoming from the full fee.) Strict exceptio is only imposed if two requirements are met: # The creditor must not have used the incomplete performance. Mere accession to land, in the case of buildings, does not amount to utilisation. One has to move into a building for it to be considered utilised. # There must be no special equitable circumstances that exist. This is where the court exercises its discretion. Performance may not be made in instalments unless such have explicitly been permitted or agreed upon by the parties; otherwise it must be made whole. Authority for this position goes as far back as Grotius, with his stipulation that performance be made in a lump.3.39.9. The defaulting debtor may not elect to pay damages in lieu of performance, unless it is at the prerogative of the creditor. The law does not require that the creditor accept an offer to this effect; he is entitled to continue to demand performance. No substitution is permitted: that is, no giving the creditor something else in lieu of performance. This is once more subject to the qualification that the parties may agree to the alternative, which is known formally as datio in solutum. In summary, then, the requirements for performance are as follows: * There must be strict compliance. * Unless specifically agreed upon, performance may not be tendered in instalments. * There is no election to pay damages in lieu of performance‚Äîunless this is agreed upon. * Performance must be in forma specifica. * There may be no substitution of performance unless the creditor accepts. = Payment = The basic requirements for performance in the form of monetary payment are to be found in the South African Reserve Bank Act,Act 90 of 1989.ss 14, 15, 17. the most important of which is that it must be in the form of legal tender. This includes notes, coins and even krugerrands. The Act also establishes limits on the volume of change or coinage that one may use. Provided that it is a reasonable amount, one may make payment in coins, but one may not meet huge sums, such as school fees, with coinage. The creditor is entitled not to accept that as viable tender. With respect to inflation, the principle of nominalism applies: The courts do not make inflation adjustments. If, therefore, one owed R100 in 1990, it remains R100 today. The debtor should pay the amount specified in contract, though some contracts specifically factor in inflation, in which case it applies. Similarly, the no-difference principle applies to foreign exchange: There are no currency conversions, so that what is claimed in one currency is owed in that currency. Payment by cheque is allowed, but only once the bank has honoured it; if the cheque bounces, it is regarded as non-payment. = Termination by agreement = Termination or alteration of an obligation by agreement may take several forms.  Variation  The parties may agree to vary a term of their contract, in which case the contract is not terminated but is simply altered in some way.  Release and waiver  A release is an agreement between the parties that the debtor be freed or \\"released\\" from an obligation. (The term \\"waiver\\" is sometimes used synonymously, but \\"release,\\" for reasons soon to become apparent, is more accurate here.) Releases are most often to be found in employment contracts. A waiver occurs when the creditor elects, without discussion or arrangement (and therefore, unlike release, usually without agreement), to \\"waive\\" certain claims or rights under a contract; it is, in other words, the unilateral act of abandoning a right that exists for the creditor's sole benefit. By way of example, the non-breaching party has the right, in cases of major breach, to claim cancellation, but that right may be waived. = Nature = Although the definitions above are generally accepted, scholarly debate rages on as to the precise nature of release and waiver. According to Kerr, it is a unilateral juristic act. The power to release a debtor from his obligation rests entirely in the hands of the creditor, who need only say, ‚ÄòI do not wish to avail myself of this right‚Äô, in order to terminate it. SW van der Merwe and his co-authors, on the other hand, contend in Contract: General Principles that it is a liberatory agreement, i.e. a bilateral juristic act that is not a contract. RH Christie advocates a distinction according to circumstances. It is a: * Contract (of donation) if it pertains to a right conferred by the contract * Unilateral act if the right is conferred by law Graham Glover calls for a different distinction: * Release is an agreement between the parties to ‚Äòrelease‚Äô the debtor from having to perform. * Waiver is a unilateral choice by the creditor to ‚Äòwaive‚Äô a right. = Features = The core features of waiver (unilateral waiver especially) are set out in Alfred McAlpine & Son v Transvaal Provincial Administration.1977 (4) SA 310 (T). There is generally a presumption against waiver‚Äîit is assumed that one does not easily or arbitrarily waive one's rights or remedies or powers‚Äîso that the burden of proof is his who alleges it.324D.Cassim v Kadir 1962 (2) SA 473 (N) 478A. The requirements for meeting this burden are carefully specified. Two questions should be asked, keeping in mind \\"the fact that persons do not as a rule lightly abandon their rights.\\" The questions are these: # Was there an intention to waiver? The creditor must have had full knowledge of his rights in terms of the waived obligation.Alfred McAlpine v Transvaal 324.Hepner v Roodepoort-Maraisburg Town Council 1962 (4) SA 772 (A) 778H. # Would a reasonable person in the circumstances believe the right to have been waived? This inquiry is important because a waiver need not expressly be made by the creditor; it may be \\"derived by implication from his conduct,\\" in which case \\"his conduct must be such that it is necessarily inconsistent with an intention to maintain his rights.\\"Bay Loan Investment (Pty), Ltd v Bay View (Pty), Ltd 540G-H.Martin v De Kock 1948 (2) SA 719 (AD) 733. In other words, as De Villiers CJ put it in Smith v Momberg,1895 (12) SC 295. \\"his conduct must be such as to leave no reasonable doubt in the mind that he not only knew what his rights were, but intended to surrender them.\\"304. Release and waiver can be either partial or complete. Release, however, usually entails the release of a debtor from the entire contract, whereas waiver is generally concerned only with one particular obligation or term of the contract.  Novation  A novation is an agreement to extinguish and replace one or more obligations with a new obligation or obligations. In Hugo Grotius‚Äô words, ‚ÄòAn obligation is released upon the terms that simultaneously another obligation takes its place‚Äô.Hugo Grotius 3.43.1. If the original obligation is void, the novation is also void. In South Africa, there are two forms of novation: novatio voluntaria and novatio necessaria. = Novatio voluntaria = Voet defines the former, voluntary novation, as ‚Äòa transformation and alteration of an earlier obligation, whether natural or civil, into another obligation whether natural or civil, when a fresh cause is created out of a foregoing cause in such wise that the earlier cause is destroyed‚Äô.Johannes Voet 46.2.2. In Swadif v Dyke,1978 1 SA 928 (A). voluntary novation is described as ‚Äòessentially a matter of intention and consensus. When parties novate they intend to replace a valid contract by another valid contract‚Äô.940G. This is novation in the strict and commonest sense: The parties novate the entire contract, but they retain their contractual relationship. Prescription ends when novation occurs. Unless, as in the case of insurance agreements, it has been explicitly removed, the first contract can revive itself (residual position) if the second contract folds, as when voided for illegality. There is a presumption against novation, so that ‚Äòwhere there is doubt the court prefers not to imply a novation‚Äô.Kerr 270. An important case in this regard is Electric Process Engraving and Stereo Co v Irwin:1940 AD 220. > The question is one of intention [.... I]n the absence of any express > declaration of the parties, the intention to effect a novation cannot be > held to exist except by way of necessary inference from all the > circumstances of the case.226-227. The second contract ‚Äò...is much rather deemed to have been made in order to strengthen the first one, and for the purpose of being annexed to it, than for the purpose of extinguishing it‚Äô.Van der Linden 1.18.2. Variation, in other words, is usually preferred to novation: It is generally assumed ‚Äòthat the parties intended only to modify, augment, or diminish the obligation, and not to extinguish the old debt, and substitute a new one, unless the contrary is particularly expressed‚Äô.Robert-Joseph Pothier 387. = Novatio necessaria = Compulsory novation, absolute in English law and much less common than voluntaria, takes place by operation of law, from ‚Äòjudicial proceedings between parties whose rights and obligations are in issue between them‚Äô.Swadif v Dyke 940H. Few judicial proceedings lead to novation; where they do, it is the damages awarded by the court that novate the contract. It is important to note that ‚Äòcompulsory novation does not release pledges or securities nor are sureties discharged; it does not interrupt the running of interest nor is mora purged‚Äô.941B. This is ‚Äòbecause properly speaking, it is not a novation, but an additional confirmation or continuation of a previous obligation‚Äô.Van Leeuwen 1.4.34.7  Compromise  A compromise or transactio is an agreement whereby the parties settle a disputed obligation or some uncertainty between them. New obligations are created, and any existing obligations are extinguished. Compromise classically takes the form of an out-of-court settlement. Where payment is made in full and final settlement, it depends on the circumstances whether this is an offer to compromise. The general rule is that the old or former relationship falls away, and the new relationship is governed by the settlement agreement.  Delegation  Delegation or intercessio is a form of novation where, by the agreement of all concerned, someone outside of the original contract is given the responsibility of carrying out the performance agreed to in it. Three parties are concerned with this act the: # Delegator, or the party who incurred the obligation to perform under the contract # Delegatee, or the party who assumes the responsibility of performing this duty # Obligee, or the party to whom this performance is owed The delegatee, in other words, is introduced as a debtor in place of the delegator (the original debtor), who is thereby discharged of his obligations. Usually this act takes the form of a full delegation of debt, and therefore a full substitution of the delegatee for the delegator. There is thus a new contract with a new debtor. The common intention of all parties that the delegation take place may be either express or implied from the circumstances, including from the conduct of the parties. Delegation is different from situations that, while similar, do not meet the definition provided above. For example, when a debtor asks a third party to meet the debt on his behalf, what we have is not a delegation but merely an agreement of mandate. Because the creditor knows nothing of this, and because, therefore, the common intention of all parties is lacking, it may not be said that a new contract has been created. Even when the debtor requests of the creditor that in future he refer to the third party for payment, this amounts only to an assignation of debt; the third party steps in of his own initiative‚Äîex promiso. This does not amount to novation.  Effluxion of time  If a contract fixes a specific period for its duration, it terminates automatically at the end of such period. The Consumer Protection Act contains mandatory rules on fixed-term contracts covered by the Act.s 14.  Notice  Long-standing contracts, or contracts for an indefinite period, are terminable upon reasonable notice unless specifically agreed otherwise. Express notice is given especially in the case of leases. A lease may be terminated on due notice of usually a month. Hybrid contracts have a fixed time as well as a termination option. Notice may also be given impliedly. In situations where the contract is silent as to when it terminates, the reasonable-time test is usually deployed. Where reasonable time has passed, a party may terminate the contract on reasonable notice. The standard for reasonableness is tested with reference primarily to the type of contract in question. If it is determined that the contract may be terminated by reasonable notice, the rules are set out by Smalberger JA in Putco v TV & Radio Guarantee:1985 (4) SA 809 (A). * Either party is entitled to give notice for any valid commercial reason. * \\"Reasonable\\" is a relative term; what is reasonable depends on the circumstances of each case. * The notice of termination must be clear and unequivocal. = Termination by operation of law = Obligations may also be terminated by law, as in the case of set-off, merger, supervening impossibility of performance, prescription, insolvency and death.  Set-off  Where two parties are reciprocally indebted to one another by reason of distinct obligations, one debt may be set off against the other to forestall the onerous burden of two different sets of possible litigation. The set-off occurs automatically, provided that its requirements are met, but applies only to liquidated claims: that is, to money only, not to pending debts. These are quickly and easily proved. Set-off (or compensatio) might in its simplest form be instanced thus: * Gore owes Hitchens R1,000 for a couch (the first obligation). * Hitchens owes Gore R1,000 for rent (the second). * The first obligation is set off against the other. * There are now no further obligations between the parties. Very rarely, however, are the obligations identical. Where one party's is greater than the other's, the smaller claim terminates and the greater diminishes. This usually occurs by way of a claim that is followed by a counterclaim.  Merger  The extinction of a debt by merger (or confusio) occurs when one person becomes both creditor and debtor in respect of a debt. This is a rare but straightforward form of termination, described in Grootchwaing Salt Works v Van Tonder1920 AD 492. as ‚Äòthe concurrence of two qualities or capacities in the same person, which mutually destroy one another‚Äô.497. Tjakie Naud√© provides an example: > A owes B R100. B dies and leaves her estate to A. A is now both debtor and > creditor in respect of the debt of R100, so that the debt is extinguished by > merger.Du Plessis, et al. p.381. Similarly, if a tenant decides to buy the property he is renting, he would not thereby become his own landlord; the relationship would be merged and thus cease to exist.  Insolvency  In the event of the debtor's insolvency (or liquidation if it is a company), the contract is not terminated immediately; its resolution is left to a trustee or judicial manager, to whom the insolvent estate is handed over. This party decides whether to terminate the contract or to settle it, or else to keep it alive if this is in the best interests of the estate. The procedure is governed by the Insolvency Act.Act 24 of 1936.  Supervening impossibility of performance  Supervening impossibility of performance takes place where an event that occurs (or supervenes) after the contract has commenced objectively renders the contract no longer performable . This event must have been unforeseen and unavoidable by a reasonable person, such that no-one in that position could have fulfilled the obligation. The distinction between supervening and initial impossibility (which does not terminate the contract) is an important one and often confused: The performance must have become objectively impossible, even if at first it was perfectly doable. These circumstances, however, must have arisen due to some unavoidable and supervening event; the cause must not have been the debtor's fault. In Peters, Flamman and Company v Kokstad Municipality,1919 AD 427. for example, a company was wound up during World War I by the Smuts government, which had declared its German owners to be enemies of state. In consequence, the company was unable any longer to carry out its contractual obligations. Kokstad Municipality sued for breach of contract, but the judge determined that, because of the supervening circumstances, performance was objectively impossible (casus fortuitus); the contract should therefore be terminated. Generic goods and services are not subject to supervening impossibility, because they are easily obtainable and performance is still theoretically executable. An inability to meet one's debts is also precluded, because it entails fault. The impossibility must, in an objective sense, be outside of one's control. The following are classic examples: * Vis maior: an act of god, beyond one's control; fault is precluded and performance rendered objectively impossible. * Casus fortuitus: intervention by the state or legislature which renders performance impossible. Supervening impossibility generally terminates the obligation, as well as any counter-obligation, from the point at which impossibility arose. Accrued rights are enforceable, but future obligations disappear. Where, however, there has been a guarantee of performance, this overrides the supervening impossibility‚Äîeven acts of god. The effect of partial or temporary impossibility of performance depends on the circumstances of the case. The general rule is that the contract is suspended until the impossibility disappears; if the supervening event goes on for an unreasonably long period of time, the creditor may cancel.World Leisure Holidays (Pty) Ltd v Georges 2002 (5) SA 531 (W).  Prescription  A person can lose or acquire rights because of the passage of time. The enforceability of obligations is also limited by time. = Extinctive prescription = Extinctive prescription entails the termination of obligations, and therefore their enforceability, by lapse of time. This ensures finality in business affairs and provides an incentive for persons to enforce their rights when they become due. It is regulated by the Prescription ActAct 68 of 1969. and the Institution of Legal Proceedings Against Certain Organs of State Act.Act 40 of 2002. The former indicates that claims to a debt are restricted to a certain period of time, after which they fall away; one has to exercise one's rights within that period if one desires performance.Chapter VII. See also s 10(1) and s 11. This residual time amounts to three years,s 11(d). and prescription begins to run when ‚Äòthe debt falls due‚Äô.s 12(1). Furthermore, ‚Äòa debt shall not be deemed to be due until certain requirements are satisfied‚Äô. These are, on the part of the creditor: # ‚ÄòKnowledge of the identity of the debtor‚Äô # ‚ÄòKnowledge of the facts from which the debt arose...provided the creditor shall be deemed to have such knowledge if he could have acquired it by exercising reasonable care‚Äô.s 12(3). Prescription is backdated accordingly, if necessary. Gerike v Sack1978 (1) SA 821 (A). was a delict case. On 13 February 1971, Gerike was injured when Sack's motorboat crashed into her. Summons was only served on Sack on 14 February 1974. Gerike acknowledged that technically, under the Prescription Act, her claim had prescribed, but argued that in fact it had not, in terms of section 12(3), because she had only discovered the identity of motorboat driver some time later. The court disagreed, finding on the evidence that, instead of leaving everything to her husband, and thereby paying a purely passive role in the identification, she could herself have asked the one question required to establish Sacks's identity. She had not exercised ‚Äòreasonable care‚Äô, in other words. In Jacobs v Adonis,1996 (4) SA 246 (C). Jacobs was, in August 1988, a passenger in Adonis's vehicle when an accident occurred, rendering him paraplegic. He also suffered memory loss, such that he had no recollection of the incident. Adonis told Jacobs that his injuries had been sustained in a hit-and-run, so that there was no one to sue. Jacobs duly claimed compensation from the Road Accident Fund. Some time later, the discovery was made that it had in fact been Adonis who caused the accident. Jacobs accordingly sued him. Because he had had no knowledge of the debtor or of the true facts of the accident until these revelations, Jacobs's claim was well within the three-year period, and Adonis's defence of extinctive prescription could not stand. The Prescription Act counters slow or busy courts with a provision to the effect that ‚Äòthe running of prescription shall be interrupted by the service on the debtor of any process whereby the creditor claims payment on the debt‚Äô,s 15(1). on the grounds that it would be unfair to penalise someone for the tardiness of the administrative process. As soon as one serves a summons, therefore, prescription is interrupted. = Acquisitive prescription = Acquisitive prescription describes the acquisition of property, or rights of ownership, and therefore falls outside the scope of contract law.  Death  Contractual rights and duties are generally transmissible on death, although not in the case of a delectus personae or an express or tacit agreement to the contrary, in which case resolution of the contract is left to the executor of the deceased's estate.  Drafting  The contracting parties‚Äô main objective during contract negotiation should be to reach a consensus regarding the exact object of their agreement on the best commercial terms and conditions. To be valid, certain contracts must be notarially executed, e.g. antenuptial or prospecting agreements and mining leases, in which case they are called ‚Äòdeeds‚Äô and are public instruments. = Commencement = It is vital to first identify the type of undertaking and describe the contracting parties. The parties and their contact details should be properly described in the contract document. = Nature and recitals = The agreement's nature depends on its contents. When the contract is nominate, care must be taken to include the essentialia for that agreement in the contract. Following the commencement should come clauses setting out the causa of the contract, its object and the extent of the parties‚Äô obligations, much of which is typically found in the recitals. = Effective date = The contract should be properly signed and dated to be effective. The contract may be dated in the introductory or execution clauses. = Sequence of clauses = The contract should be structured in a logical and practical fashion. After the commencement, recitals and the definitions and interpretation clause, the operative provisions should appear.  Specific terms  First come core provisions that set out the undertakings and primary obligations specifically negotiated by the parties for their contractual relationship, such as clauses on the remedies for breach of contract, including cancellation, penalty, forfeiture, limitation and exemption clauses; and conditions and time periods.  General terms  Then follow general clauses on variation, severability, entire agreement, cession, waiver, domicilium citandi et executandi (notices, address for service), applicable law and jurisdiction, alternative dispute resolution procedures, force majeure (vis major and casus fortuitus), costs, and confidentiality. = Structure and language = Lastly, principles of good language and grammar, and proper numbering, should be used throughout.

Laser surface velocimeters use the laser Doppler principle to evaluate the laser light scattered back from a moving object. They are widely used for process and quality control in industrial production processes. Principle of operation =The differential Doppler process= The differential Doppler process The Doppler effect (or Doppler shift) is the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. The wave has a frequency f and propagates at a speed c When the observer moves at a velocity of v relative to the source, they receive a different frequency f' according to :f' = f ( \\\\frac{c-v}{c} ) = f \\\\left( 1-\\\\frac{v}{c} \\\\right) The above analysis is an approximation for small velocities in comparison to the speed of light which is fulfilled very well for practically all technically relevant velocities. To make a measurement on moving objects, which can in principle be of any length, requires a measurement design with an observation axis for the sensor which is at a right angle to the direction of movement of the object under investigation. Laser surface velocimeters work according to the so-called difference Doppler technique. Here, 2 laser beams which are each incident to the optical axis at an angle œÜ, are superimposed on the surface of the object. For a point P, which moves at velocity v through the intersection point of the two laser beams, the frequencies of the two laser beams are Doppler shifted in accordance with the above formula. At the point P of the object which is moving at the velocity v, the following frequencies therefore occur: :f_\\\\text{P1,2} = f_\\\\text{1,2} \\\\left( 1- \\\\vec v \\\\ast \\\\frac{\\\\vec e_\\\\text{1,2}}{c}\\\\right) :\\\\vec e_\\\\text{1,2,e} = Unit vectors of laser beams 1 and 2 and in direction detector :f1,2 = Frequencies of the laser beams 1 and 2 :fP1,P2 = Doppler shifted frequencies of laser beams 1 and 2 in point P The point P now emits scatter waves in the direction of the detector. As P is moving with the object, the scattered radiation in the direction \\\\vec e_\\\\text{e} of the detector is also Doppler shifted. Thus for the frequency of the scatter waves in the direction of the detector, it can be said: : \\\\begin{align} f_\\\\text{e1,e2} & = f_\\\\text{P1,P2} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\vec v \\\\ast \\\\vec e_\\\\text{e}}{c} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = f_\\\\text{1,2} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\vec v \\\\ast \\\\vec e_\\\\text{1,2}}{c} \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\vec v \\\\ast \\\\vec e_\\\\text{e}}{c} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} The scatter waves are superimposed on the detector. Due to the interference of the scatter waves from the two laser beams, there are different frequency components in the superimposition. The low-frequency beat frequency of the superimposed scatter radiation which corresponds to the Doppler frequency fD is analyzed metrologically. When both incidental laser beams are at the same frequency (same wavelength), this is seen as a difference of fe2 and fe1 to: : \\\\begin{align} f_\\\\text{D} & = f_\\\\text{e2} - f_\\\\text{e1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = f \\\\left(\\\\vec v \\\\ast \\\\frac{\\\\vec e_\\\\text{1} - \\\\vec e_\\\\text{2}}{c} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\vec v \\\\ast \\\\vec e_\\\\text{e}}{c} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} If point P moves vertically with reference to the optical axis and at the same angle of incidence œÜ, it can be said that: :\\\\vec v \\\\ast (\\\\vec e_\\\\text{1} - \\\\vec e_\\\\text{2}) = 2 v \\\\sin \\\\varphi and :\\\\vec v \\\\ast \\\\vec e_\\\\text{e}=0 This means the final result is: :f_\\\\text{D} = \\\\frac{v}{\\\\Delta s} The Doppler shift is thus directly proportional to the velocity. A graphic explanation which leads to the same result follows: =Graphic representation= Principle of laser surface velocimetry Both the laser beams are superimposed in the measurement volume and in this spatial area, generate an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes. The fringe spacing Œîs is a system constant which depends on the laser wavelength Œª and the angle between the laser beams 2œÜ: :\\\\Delta s = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2 \\\\sin \\\\varphi} If a particle moves through the fringe pattern, then the intensity of the light it scatters back is modulated. As a result of this, a photo receiver in the sensor head generates an AC signal, the frequency fD of which is directly proportional to the velocity component of the surface in measurement direction vp and it can be said that: :f_\\\\text{D} = \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{p}}{\\\\Delta s} = \\\\frac{2v}{\\\\lambda} \\\\sin \\\\varphi :fD = Doppler frequency :vp = Velocity component in the direction of measurement :Œîs = Fringe spacing in the measurement volume =The heterodyne technique= Laser surface velocimeters work in the so-called heterodyne mode, i.e. the frequency of one of the laser beams is shifted by an offset of 40 MHz, e.g.. This makes the fringes in the measurement volume travel with a velocity corresponding to the offset frequency fB. This then makes it possible to identify the direction of movement of the object and to measure at the velocity zero. The resulting modulation frequency fmod at the photo receiver in heterodyne mode is: :f_\\\\text{mod} = f_\\\\text{b} + \\\\frac{v_\\\\text{p}}{\\\\Delta s} = f_\\\\text{b} + \\\\frac{2v}{\\\\lambda} \\\\sin \\\\varphi The modulation frequency is determined in the controller using Fourier transformation and converted into the measurement value for the velocity vp. The length measurement is made by integrating the velocity signal. Applications Laser surface velocimeters measure speed and length of moving surfaces on coils, strips, tubes, fiber, film, paper, foil, composite lumber, or almost any other moving material, including hot steel. LSVs can accomplish various tasks like cut-to-length control, part length and spool length measurement, speed measurement and speed control, differential speed measurement for mass flow control, encoder calibration, ink-jet marker control, and many others.

It is mentioned in Ptolemy's atlas of Magna Germania as Eburodunum.Spiegel.de From the 11th century, a castle of the governing P≈ôemyslid dynasty stood here, and was the seat of the non-ruling prince. During the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. They were also responsible for maintaining regional records. During the Hussite Wars, the city remained faithful to Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. The Hussites twice laid siege to the city, once in 1428 and again in 1430, both times in vain. During the Thirty Years' War, in 1643 and 1645, Brno was the only city to succeed in defending itself against Swedish sieges, thereby allowing the Austrian Empire to regroup its armies and to repel the Swedes. In recognition of its services, the city was rewarded with a renewal of its city privileges. In the years following the Thirty Years' War, the city became an impregnable Baroque fortress. In 1742, the Prussians vainly attempted to conquer the city, and the position of Brno was confirmed with the establishment of a bishopric in 1777. In 1805, The Battle of Austerlitz took place about 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Brno. In the 18th century, development of industry and trade began, and continued into the next century. Soon after the industrial revolution, the town became one of the industrial centres of Moravia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire ‚Äì sometimes referred to as the \\"Moravian Manchester\\". In 1839, the first train arrived in Brno. Together with the development of industry came the growth of the suburbs, and the city lost its fortifications, as did the Spielberg fortress, which became a notorious prison to which were sent not only criminals, but also political opponents of the Austrian Empire. Gas lighting was introduced to the city in 1847 and trams in 1869. Mahen Theatre in Brno was the first theatre building in Europe to use Edison's electric lamps, Thomas Edison then visited Brno in 1911 to see the theatre. During the \\"First Republic\\" (1918‚Äì1938), Brno continued to grow in importance ‚Äì Masaryk University was established (1919), the state armoury and automotive factory ƒåeskoslovensk√° st√°tn√≠ zbrojovka Brno was established (1919), and the Brno Fairgrounds were opened in 1928 with an exhibition of contemporary culture. The city was not only a centre of industry and commerce, but also of education and culture (see the section on notable people from Brno). In 1939, Brno was annexed by Nazi Germany along with the rest of Moravia and Bohemia. All Czech higher education institutions were closed down on 17 November including four universities in Brno. 173 students were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp and Kounic's students residence was transformed into Gestapo headquarters and prison. Brno was liberated on 26 April 1945 by Red Army after more than two weeks of heavy fighting. After the war, and the reestablishment of the Czechoslovak state, the majority of the ethnic German population (except antifascists, members of the resistance, mixed marriages, etc.) was expelled to Germany or Austria. The expulsion of some 20,000 Germans is referred to as Brno death march. See also * Timeline of Brno * Other names of Brno  References  Further reading   * (2010) Filip, A., Krejƒç√≠, J.

She married her father's young cousin, also an astronomer, Michel Le Francais de Lalande (1776-1839) in 1788. Her father taught the young couple calculation and observation methods in astronomy. She worked closely alongside her father and contributed to many of his publications.

These calculations earned her father one of the medals of the Lyc√©e des Arts for distinguished scholars and artists. Her work was also published in her father's annual almanac from 1794 to 1806. In 1799, she established a catalog of 10,000 stars. In 1791, her expertise in astronomy earned her the privilege of guiding the son of famous astronomer Jean Dominique Cassini, through his first observation at the College de France. She also collaborated on the writing of L'Histoire c√©leste fran√ßaise written by Lalande and published in 1801. The work indicated the position of 50,000 stars.

The star is embedded in thick shells of expelled gases and dust, and owing to its appearance has been nicknamed by astronomers the \\"Fried Egg Nebula\\". Yellow hypergiants are in an extremely active phase of their evolution. Discovery The star was discovered and catalogued as emission line star Hen 3-1379 in 1976, and classified as a proto-planetary nebula in 2003 after the 2.2 micron infrared sky survey. In 1989, it was analysed as a post-AGB star and assumed to have a luminosity of and a distance around 1,000 pc. Although IRAS 17163-3907 is one of the brightest mid-IR sources in the sky, very few observations were made until 2011 when it was proposed to be at a much larger distance and hence to be a highly luminous object, probably a yellow hypergiant. Description The picture of the star causing it to be dubbed the Fried Egg Nebula was taken in the mid infrared spectrum by the VISIR instrument in the Very Large Telescope in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. The filters passed light of frequencies 12,810 nm (mapped to red in the image), 11,850 nm (mapped to green), and 8,590 nm (mapped to blue). The star is about 500,000 times the luminosity of the Sun. The photograph pictured is one of the best ever taken of a yellow hypergiant. The star is eventually expected to end its life in a supernova. Shells The star is characterized by two visible dusty shells. The inner shell is 4800 AUs in diameter and the outer shell is 12,000 AU wide. The source of materials for the shells is material ejected from the star during ejection events common in hypergiants. The time period between expulsion of materials causing the first and the second outer shells is estimated at 435 years and the total mass in the ejecta is around , of which about 1% is dust. At its most active the star ejects materials equal to the mass of the Sun every few hundred years. The shells are also discovered to be rich in silicates and hence oxygen. The star may contain more outer shells, but they were not detected by the VISIR instrument, as the field of view of the instrument is insufficient. Estimates of the outer shell are that it contains 0.17 solar masses of dust and was produced in an outburst 17,000 years ago that expelled 6-7 solar masses of gas. The properties of these shells are considered similar to those surrounding IRC+10420 (also an evolved massive star suffering heavy mass loss) as well as, for the outer shell, those around luminous blue variables, suggesting both that IRAS 17163‚àí3907 is in a pre-LBV stage and that the ring nebulae that often surround those types of stars may originate with mass loss during the red supergiant stage.

It transported three members of the Expedition 39 crew to the International Space Station. TMA-12M was the 121st flight of a Soyuz spacecraft since the first in 1967 and the 38th Soyuz mission to the ISS. After a successful launch on 25 March 2014, docking was scheduled to occur on 26 March via the relatively new six-hour duration orbital trajectory. In the event, one of the orbital burns scheduled to refine the trajectory did not occur as planned, due to an attitude control problem in which the spacecraft was incorrectly oriented. The rendezvous phase was subsequently replanned to the formerly-used two-day trajectory. Accordingly, TMA-12M arrived at the ISS on 27 March. The Soyuz remained docked to the ISS to serve as an emergency escape vehicle until undocking and landing as scheduled on 11 September 2014. Crew =Backup crew= Mission highlights =Launch= Soyuz TMA-12M successfully launched aboard a Soyuz-FG rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 21:17 UTC on Tuesday, 25 March 2014 (3:17 AM Wednesday 26 March local time). Approximately nine minutes later, the spacecraft reached low Earth orbit. Because of the nighttime launch and the fact that the International Space Station was orbiting over Baikonur at the time of lift-off, the launch of TMA-12M was visible from the ISS and NASA astronaut Richard Mastracchio was able to take a photograph of the view (see below in gallery). =Rendezvous and docking= Originally, TMA-12M was scheduled to dock with the International Space Station's Poisk module at 03:04 UTC on 26 March 2014, with hatch opening scheduled for 04:45 UTC. The spacecraft was not able to perform the third course-correction successfully, however, and docking was rescheduled for Thursday, 27 March at 23:58 UTC at the earliest. The approach and docking phase of the mission was reverted to the previous two-day profile used in Soyuz flights before Soyuz TMA-08M, leaving the possibility of updating the mission profile after the nature of the issue was fully known. Initially, flight controllers suspected it was an issue with the attitude (orientation) control system. According to flight controllers, the crew was not in any danger and ample supplies were on board the Soyuz for the modified flight profile. On 26 March, the first two maneuvers of the revised 34-orbit rendezvous plan occurred without incident, with docking scheduled for 27 March, although engineers had yet to determine the exact cause of the initial failure. Ultimately, the remainder of the rendezvous was nominal and TMA-12M successfully docked with the ISS at 23:53 UTC on 27 March, five minutes ahead of the rescheduled time, with hatch opening between the two spacecraft occurring at 02:35 UTC on 28 March. Upon their arrival, Skvortsov, Artemyev and Swanson joined the crew of Expedition 39, as part of which they remained until they transferred to the crew of Expedition 40 after the May 2014 departure of Soyuz TMA-11M. The crew members of TMA-12M remained aboard the ISS until September 2014, when the spacecraft undocked and returned to Earth as scheduled. =Undocking and return to Earth= Expedition 40 commander Steven Swanson formally handed over command of the ISS to Expedition 41 commander Maksim Surayev on 9 September, the day before the mission's scheduled departure. After closing the hatches separating the station and Soyuz at 19:35 UTC on 10 September, TMA-12M undocked from the International Space Station at 23:01 UTC, ending the Expedition 40 mission and transferring control of the station to Expedition 41. The spacecraft executed a de-orbit burn at 01:30 UTC on 11 September and began re-entry at 2:01 UTC with landing occurring successfully in the Kazakh Steppe region of Kazakhstan at 2:23 UTC.

Classification In 2006, L√º Junchang and colleagues named the clade Boreopteridae for the clade containing the common ancestor of Boreopterus and Feilongus and all its descendants, which the authors reclassified as close relatives of the ornithocheirids. (Feilongus had originally been considered a gallodactylid). Many possible boreopterids were subsequently described, one possible example being Aetodactylus, which has been claimed to be similar to Boreopterus. Originally considered close relatives of the ornithocheirids, many of these supposed boreopterids have been found to belong to other groups of the pterodactyloid lineage. In 2012, a phylogenetic analysis by L√º et al. divided the Boreopteridae into two subfamilies: Boreopterinae, comprising Boreopterus and Zhenyuanopterus, and Moganopterinae, comprising Feilongus and Moganopterus. However, in 2013, Andres & Myers found both Boreopterus and Feilongus to be closely related to Cycnorhamphus, making them members of the Gallodactylidae as had been originally thought when Feilongus was discovered. A subsequent analysis including the other supposed boreopterids found that Boreopterus itself, and therefore the name Boreopteridae, was indeed a member of the ornithocheiroid clade, but that Feilongus was in fact a ctenochasmatoid closely related to Gnathosaurus. The true boreopterid clade was found to contain Boreopterus, Guidraco, and Zhenyuanopterus by Andres and colleagues in 2014, and was then found to contain just Boreopterus and Zhenyuanopterus by Wu and colleagues in 2017, a subsequently followed classification by recent studies. =Phylogeny= The Boreopteridae was included in an analysis by Brian Andres and colleagues in 2014, where it was placed in a basal position within the Anhangueria. However, a topology recovered by Nicholas Longrich and colleagues in 2018 placed the family Boreopteridae as the sister taxon of the family Lonchodectidae, while also placed outside the Anhangueria.Longrich, N.R., Martill, D.M., and Andres, B. (2018). \\"Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous- Paleogene boundary.\\" PLoS Biology, 16(3): e2001663. Topology 1: Andres et al. (2014). Topology 2: Longrich et al. (2018). Paleoecology The known taxa come from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning, which represented a lake system, suggesting that these animals occurred in freshwater habitats. They are thought to have foraged while swimming, trapping prey with their needle-like teeth;Mark Witton, 2011 this method of fishing was probably analogous to that of Platanista dolphins, which share a similar dentition.

He raised awareness in the mid 1990s by expressing serious concerns about the implementation of the Euro. In his opinion, the strict fulfillment of the Maastricht Criteria had to be guaranteed by all means. Therefore, 1999 seemed to be too early for many European states. However, he urgently sought the compromise of a German-French monetary union (the only two states which would have fulfilled the criteria at that time) in order not to risk German jobs. He proposed to postpone the implementation of the monetary union for five years. In 2011 he was interviewed by the news portal EurActiv. During this interview, he discussed his early concerns but also clearly opposed a possible Greek insolvency. Since June 2006 he has been the President of the European Movement Germany.

Little Harbor was located between Garden and Thompson on the Garden Peninsula. It was a steam powered sawmill town founded between 1885 and 1887 by Alfred Tracy and William L. Marble (although some fishing cabins existed at the harbor at the time of Meriweathers survey for the United States Geological Survey in 1848). The entrance to the town is from the southeast with a narrow passage which leads to a natural twenty-foot deep harbor which is protected from all sides. The land entrance was a stairway that led from the bluff to the town site. The town was about three blocks long and consisted of two rows of houses, a boarding house, store, and pool hall. A wharf then went out several hundred feet into the harbor. There was a brick furnace, a sawmill and shingle mill combined. This was a common sawmill at the time because cedar was often mixed with stands of white pine and there was a market for shingles, hardwood flooring and lath as well as dimensional lumber. The logs were cut and brought to the top of the bluff in the winter by a man and team of horses and then rolled down to the live logs skidway. After the economic panic of 1893, the town was sold to Martin Valetine who ran the town for a number of years, finally selling it to Isaac and Bill Bonifas and later to Ben Miller. By this time, the timber was nearly gone and Miller dismantled the mill and stored it on the shore for shipment. The only known pirate of the Great Lakes, Dan Seavey, stole all the equipment and sold it. In the early 1900s the town was used as a fishing port but eventually the wharf was washed away and none of the houses remain.

His desire to play the bass guitar came not only from his father but also from the music of Chris Squire from \\"Yes\\" and Geddy Lee from \\"Rush\\". Early career At 17, Harbour played his first gig. He joined musicians who performed a repertoire of Top 40, College rock and covers. One of these musicians was Harbour's high school friend, Kevin White, who played the guitar. Together, they recorded some music. Harbour founded an instrumental trio called \\"Uncle Festre\\". Harbour obtained work as a studio session bassist for local musicians from Louisiana. Career =Manta Ray= In the late 1980s, Harbour joined the Dallas, Texas band \\"Manta Ray\\". The group was founded by Lance Harvill (who went on to the \\"Arms if the Sun\\" project) and included John Luke Hebert on drums and Mike Morgan a guitarist who became Lance's mentor. In 1990, \\"Manta Ray\\" recorded a demo album at the \\"Dallas Sound Lab\\" in classic hard 'n' heavy style. =Member of Chastain= In 1989, David T. Chastain, a guitarist invited Harbour to record bass parts on his instrumental solo album, Within The Heat. Harbour then joined Chastain's eponymous band, Chastain. In 1989, Harbour participated in the album, Shock Waves, a solo album by \\"Chastain's\\" vocalist, Leather Leone. In 1990, Harbour contributed to \\"Chastain's\\" album of classic heavy metal songs called For Those Who Dare. Harbour collaborated with David Chastain until the mid-1990s. Together, they recorded another two solo instrumental albums: Elegant Seduction (1991) and Next Planet Please (1994). These albums show a gradual departure from heavy metal music towards prog rock and fusion. While Harbour was a member, \\"Chastain\\" took three world tours. =Collaboration with Michael Harris= In June 1991, Chastain and Harris (who had played on the Leather album) collaborated to tour in the US and Mexico, record and release a concert album. Harbour recorded the rhythm section on Chastain's side and Greg Martin played drums on Harris' side. The resulting album, Live! Wild And Truly Diminished!!, was released in 1992. It contained concert versions of Harris' and Chastain's previous solo works and the concert improvisations of each. Harbour contributed to the album a solo bass guitar improvisation called B.O.F.. During the early 1990s, Harbour developed his pianistic skills and prepared his first solo album, with the working title, Lost For Words. =Member of King Diamond= \\"Chastain's\\" former drummer, John Luke Hebert, invited Harbour to play with his band \\"King Diamond\\" in 1999, as the bass guitar position was vacant. After a personal conversation with the band members, Harbour joined the group without further question. In 2000, he contributed bass guitar accompaniment to the band's album House Of God recorded at the \\"Nomad Recording Studio\\". \\"King Diamond\\" took a self-titled tour after which Harbour left the band. =Ideology= In 2003, Harbour's solo album, Ideology was released on CD. Harbour composed music for the album, played piano and keyboard parts and bass guitar and took creative control, incorporating a number of different styles such as rock, jazz, prog rock, impressionism and new age. Influences evident in the album's music include George Winston, Tori Amos, Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, Sting, and bands such as \\"Pink Floyd\\" and \\"Rush\\". Throughout the CD, the bass guitar contributes an independent melodic line in counterpoint to the piano, rather than just a simple rhythm accompaniment. =Gods of Balance= After the release of the Ideology CD, Harbour commenced work on Gods of Balance in collaboration with bass guitarist, Michael Manring. Despite Harbour needing time to promote Ideology (for example with a supporting tour), the new work commenced (as Manring was available). Harbour recorded bass guitar parts for Manring's new composition, Phobos and Deimos at \\"Castle Zeek Studio\\" in Austin, Texas. Beyond this, the Gods of Balance album was postponed for four years. During this time, Harbour explored musicianship and musical expression with the guitar, piano and fretless instruments. =Later work= During the 2000s, Harbour worked as a studio session bass guitar and piano player with various musicians including, the rock bands \\"Doppler Effect\\", \\"T \\", the black metal band Absu, the darkwave/ambient project \\"Proscriptor\\", shred bass metal musician Ben Kuzay, and dark ambient band, Equimanthorn. In Dallas, in 2006, Harbour joined a local band, \\"49th Vibration\\". With an old friend, guitarist Troy Thibodeaux (ex-\\"Damaged Faith\\") and drummer April Samuels, Harbour played several club concerts and recorded a demo consisting of four songs in folk-pop-rock genre. Harbour has also played solo bass guitar and piano compositions in house concerts. : The Gingerman (bass solo, 2005) : Broken (piano solo, 2008) : Obelisk/Liberation (piano solo, 2008) : A Song That Doesn‚Äôt Exist (Trip Wamsley, 2008) In 2009, Harbour wrote Is it just me?. In 2010, he collaborated with Harris, Marco Minnemann drummer, Adam Nitti, Bunny Brunel and James Martin to record the album Tranz-Fused. David left \\"49th Vibration\\" in 2011. =Lava Lamp= In December 2011, David Harbour shared with April Samuels (\\"49th Vibration\\") his new musical vision. From that moment David and April began rehearsing as a duo \\"Lava Lamp\\". David playing piano primarily, but at times acoustic guitar, and April playing a percussion/drum set, often working off one another through improvisational pieces.  Discography  * David T.

Santorinis have a deep red color and have firm, not particularly moist flesh with a high seed content. They are known for their high carbohydrate content and a sweet, strongly acidic taste. They have a round, slightly flattened shape and weigh 15-27 grams. They often have pronounced flutes, especially those growing lowest on the plant. The fruits generally ripen in 80-90 days. Growing Conditions Santorini is a volcanic island, and its characteristic soil and weather define the character of Santorini tomatoes. The island receives less than 370mm of rainfall annually, so the crops must rely on dew and the high, 71%, humidity throughout the year. The soil contains no nitrogen, and the tomatoes are often unfertilized. On the other hand, the soil contains sodium, which is hygroscopic, and can absorb moisture from the air and traps it. The water stress and limey, alkaline soil largely account for the selective breeding that developed this tomato. History It is widely believed that an abbot of the Capuchin monastery in Ano Syros (Cyclades) brought the first cherry tomatoes to Greece in 1818. The variety of tomato began to be regularly cultivated in 1875. By the 1900s, 20,000 acres of tomatoes were regularly being harvested in Santorini. Tomato production has declined since this time due to various environment, political, and tourism issues. The Santorini tomato has been protected with an official designation of origin since June 13th 2013.

His oldest sister, Eleonor Magdalene married Emperor Leopold I in 1676. In August 1689, after he had visited his brother in Breslau and his sister in Vienna, Philip William began his Grand Tour to Italy.

The pinnace was usually rowed but could be rigged with a sail for use in favorable winds. A pinnace would ferry passengers and mail, communicate between vessels, scout to sound anchorages, convey water and provisions, or carry armed sailors for boarding expeditions.Cf. (examples: \\"[a]t 5 sent our pinnace alongside of a French Man of War (lying at Tunis) with a letter to Consul Eaton ...\\"; \\"[a]t 8 the pinnace returned from the island, she found no bottom within 20 or 30 yards of the shore.\\"; \\"[a]t 2 lower'd down our pinnace alongside of an American vessel lying in the bay.

The Spanish favored them as lightweight smuggling vessels while the Dutch used them as raiders. In modern parlance, \\"pinnace\\" has come to mean an auxiliary vessel that does not fit under the \\"launch\\" or \\"lifeboat\\" definitions. Original designs \\"Small\\" pinnace under full sail‚Äîartist Identification of some pinnaces in contemporary historical documents is often difficult because there was no standardization of pinnace design, be the type \\"small\\" or \\"large\\". The term seems to have been applied to variants of what may be called the full-rigged pinnace, rather than the alternative use of the term for a larger vessel's boat. Furthermore, several ship type and rig terms were used in the 17th century, but with very different definitions from those applied today. Re-assessment of the design of some 17th-century ships not designated \\"pinnace\\" sometimes uncovers the unexpected. For example, in the 17th century, brigantine referred to a two-masted sailing ship that was square-rigged on the foremast, and fore-and-aft rigged on the main mast. The designation \\"brig\\" did not exist until the early 18th century, by which time vessels described as pinnaces had been well known for at least a century and a half. By the late 17th century, a brigantine in the Royal Navy was a small, square-rigged, two-masted ship that could be rowed as well as sailed. \\"Brig\\" referred to any ship that was square-rigged on both masts. When \\"brig\\" and \\"brigantine\\" were too widely applied, other possibilities for ship types were obscured.\\"The Sailing Ships of New England, 1607-1907\\", by John Robinson and George Francis Dow, Marine Research Society, Salem, Massachusetts: 1922, pp.10-11. There is also the problem in sorting out what is meant by a \\"barque\\" in the early 17th century. The \\"barque\\" or \\"bark\\" rig as we understand it was not known in the first half of the 17th century, and so exactly what is meant by a \\"barque\\" is not clear. \\"When Governor Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony wrote of 'barques', he referred to ships that were both 'small' and 'large' and weighed 12 to 40 tons\\", thereby suggesting the two types of pinnace and their usual range in tonnage.Some Seventeenth-Century Vessels and the Sparrow Hawk, by William Avery Baker. Pilgrim Society Note, Series One, No. 28, 1980. Updated May 18, 2005, retrieved February 2, 2011. Often decked over, the \\"small\\" pinnace was able to support a variety of rigs, each of which conferred maximum utility to specific missions such as fishing, cargo transport and storage, or open ocean voyaging. The mature \\"small\\" pinnace design emerged as versatile with several different options and rigs possible. The expected popularity of the pinnace in the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the first half of the 17th century is documented. By the 1630s, historical records mention many ships trading or fishing with the Massachusetts Bay Colony, some of which were also built in-colony. Above all, the fishing trade had taken hold off the shores of New England, and was immediately successful. The pinnace may have been the preferred, multi-use small ship of the first decades of English settlement in \\"Virginia\\".\\"The Sailing Ships of New England, 1607-1907\\", by John Robinson and George Francis Dow, Marine Research Society, Salem, Massachusetts: 1922, pp.10-11. A house carpenter at the Plymouth Colony in 1624 or 1625 constructed a pinnace from a shallop, an \\"extreme make over\\" that is occasionally noted throughout the 17th century. He sawed a large shallop in half, then lengthened and decked it over to make a pinnace that did \\"good service for seven years\\". Steam pinnace With the introduction of steam propulsion came the steam pinnace. Coal burning warships were particularly vulnerable when at anchor, immobile until they could get a head of steam. Steam pinnaces were designed to be small enough to be carried by the capital ships they were allocated to and in addition to other duties were armed to act as picket boats.Steam Pinnace 199Pinnace Gun One example of a ship utilizing many steam pinnace (ship's boats) was HMS London in Zanzibar while suppressing the slave trade in the region: > Slavery was legal in all Muslim countries, and HM ships could only become > involved with slaving when it took place on the high seas.

The processor is designed to offer high multithreaded performance (8 threads per core, with 8 cores per chip), as well as high single threaded performance from the same chip. The chip is the 4th generation processor in the T-Series family. Sun Microsystems brought the first T-Series processor (UltraSPARC T1) to market in 2005. The chip is the first Sun/Oracle SPARC chip to use dynamic threading and out-of-order execution. It incorporates one floating point unit and one dedicated cryptographic unit per core. The cores use the 64-bit SPARC Version 9 architecture running at frequencies between 2.85 GHz and 3.0 GHz, and are built in a 40 nm process with a die size of . History and design An eight core, eight thread per core chip built in a 40 nm process and running at 2.5 GHz was described in Sun Microsystems' processor roadmap of 2009. It was codenamed \\"Yosemite Falls\\" and given an expected release date of late 2011. The processor was expected to introduce a new microarchitecture, codenamed \\"VT Core\\". The online technology website The Register speculated that this chip would be named \\"T4\\", being the successor to the SPARC T3. The Yosemite Falls CPU product remained on Oracle Corporation's processor roadmap after the company took over Sun in early 2010. In December 2010 the T4 processor was confirmed by Oracle's VP of hardware development to be designed for improved per-thread performance, with eight cores, and with an expected release within one year. The processor design was presented at the 2011 Hot Chips conference. The cores (renamed \\"S3\\" from \\"VT\\") included a dual-issue 16 stage integer pipeline, and 11-cycle floating point pipeline, both giving improvements over the previous (\\"S2\\") core used in the SPARC T3 processor. Each core has associated 16 KB data and 16 KB instruction L1 caches, and a unified 128 KB L2 Cache. All eight cores share 4 MB L3 cache, and the total transistor count is approximately 855 million. The design was the first Sun/Oracle SPARC processor with out-of-order execution and was the first processor in the SPARC T-Series family to include the ability to issue more than one instruction per cycle to a core's execution units. The T4 processor was officially introduced as part of Oracle's SPARC T4 servers in September 2011. Initial product releases of a single processor T4-1 rack server ran at 2.85 GHz. The dual processor T4-2 ran at the same 2.85 GHz frequency, and the quad processor T4-4 server ran at 3.0 GHz. The SPARC S3 core also include a thread priority mechanism (called \\"dynamic threading\\") whereby each thread is allocated resources based on need, giving increased performance. Most S3 core resources are shared among all active threads, up to 8 of them. Shared resources include branch prediction structures, various buffer entries, and out-of-order execution resources. Static resource allocation reserves the resources to the threads based on a policy whether the thread can use them or not. Dynamic threading allocates these resources to the threads that are ready and will use them, thus improving performance. Cryptographic performance was also increased over the T3 chip by design improvements including a new set of cryptographic instructions. UltraSPARC T2 and T3's per-core cryptographic coprocessors were replaced with in-core accelerators and instruction-based cryptography. The implementation is designed to achieve wire speed encryption and decryption on the SPARC T4's 10-Gbit/s Ethernet ports. The architectural changes are claimed to deliver a 5x improvement in single thread integer performance and twice the per-thread throughput performance compared to the previous generation T3. The published SPECjvm2008 result for a 16-core T4-2 is 454 ops/m and 321 ops/m for the 32-core T3-2 which is a ratio of 2.8x in performance per core.

The terminal is one of two, with the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal located at Coquelles, near Calais.  History  As part of the Channel Tunnel project, the plan for services included the use of dedicated shuttle trains that would carry both passenger and freight vehicles between Britain and France, which would compete with the cross-channel ferries. In order to accommodate these services, it was planned to build a brand new vehicle terminal on each side of the tunnel that would allow cars and lorries to be loaded quickly onto the trains. The site chosen for the British terminal was Cheriton, in Folkestone, Kent, not far from the British tunnel portal. The site eventually came to nearly in area, which was considerably smaller than the French terminal. It is bordered by both Cheriton and Newington. The hamlet of Danton Pinch was in the middle of where the terminal was to go, and so was demolished. Some ancient woodland and listed buildings were removed with care and transported elsewhere. Construction began at the same time as boring for the tunnel, which provided large amounts of soil to be used to stabilise and level the terminal site before construction of the facility was undertaken. At the same time, a pipeline was provided connecting Sandgate and Goodwin Sands for the transport of dredged sand to the site. A 6.5km pipeline was laid from Sandgate to the terminal. Dredging was by Westminster Dredging. The major elements to be built at Cheriton were the platforms and overbridges, which connected the terminal to the M20 motorway, which was completed simultaneously with the tunnel project. The tunnel was officially opened on 6 May 1994, with services between Cheriton and Coquelles beginning in July the same year, when the first freight shuttles started running. Passenger services then started in December 1994. As a result of the Sangatte Protocol signed between France and the UK in 1991, juxtaposed controls have been established. Travellers going from Cheriton to Coquelles clear French entry immigration and customs checks before boarding the train in Cheriton, rather than on arrival in Coquelles.  Infrastructure  The terminal consists of eight island platforms, which are each 791 metres in length, with four overbridges connecting them to the motorway and the terminal. The overbridges are located at approximately equidistant points along the length of the platforms so that vehicles have to drive for as little distance as possible along the platforms themselves; vehicles unloaded from the front to the middle of the train would use the furthest bridge, while those unloaded from the centre to the rear would use the next bridge in, and vice versa for those vehicles embarking. The two bridges at the western end of the platforms are intended for embarking vehicles, while those at the eastern end are for those disembarking. The island platforms are separated by single track, allowing vehicles to access the train from both sides. The terminal is located at the end of a loop connected to the route from the tunnel; trains exiting the tunnel travel clockwise around this loop and then pull into the terminal, meaning the locomotive that pulled the train will remain at the front for the next service through the tunnel. The terminal at Coquelles also has a loop arrangement, but instead trains travel anticlockwise; this is intended to ensure equal wear on the flanges of the wheels. There was more room for a flyover on the French side to create an anticlockwise loop than at the Folkestone terminal. The terminal has a larger loading gauge than the rest of the British network owing to the oversized trailers used to carry the road going vehicles. As a consequence, all maintenance of the rolling stock is undertaken within the small, self-contained Channel Tunnel rail network, with the major work carried out at Coquelles (which is a much larger facility), and minor work undertaken at Cheriton. When rolling stock does need to be taken to another British location, locomotives and carriages are transported by trucks, as was done with the refurbishment of the locomotives at Brush traction in 2010/2011. The Eurotunnel rail control centre is located within the Folkestone Terminal. All Channel Tunnel traffic is managed from here. There is a back-up centre at the Calais terminal, should it need to be used. Access to platform 3.

As a result of an Iroquois attack and dispersal of the Hurons in 1649, the Hurons settled in Michilimackinac.Fenton, William N \\"KONDIARONK, Le Rat.\\" Dictionary of Canadian Biography. ¬©2000 University of Toronto/Universite Laval. Web. 21 Feb. 2012. The Michilimackinac area refers to the strait between Lakes Huron and Michigan (or, the area between Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas).\\"MICHILIMACKINAC - Mackinaw, Mackinac Straits, Mackinac Island .\\" MICHILIMACKINAC. Web. 25 Feb. 2012. Noted as a brilliant orator and a formidable strategist, he led the pro- French Petun and Huron refugees of Michilimackinac against their traditional Iroquois enemies. Kondiaronk realized the only way to establish security was to maintain a war between their enemies, the Iroquois, and the French in an attempt to keep the Iroquois occupied and the Hurons safe from annihilation. Kondiaronk succeeded in killing the peace; however, once he had secured the preservation of his people he favored a vast peace settlement.Collard, Edgar Andrew. Montreal: The Days That Are No More. Toronto: Doubleday Canada, 1976. Print. This effort concluded in what is known as The Great Peace of Montreal (1701) between France, the Iroquois, and the other Indian tribes of the Upper Great Lakes. This ended the Beaver Wars and helped open up the interior of North America to deeper French exploration and commerce. Kondiaronk made them see the advantages such a peace would bring them. The Jesuit historian, Father Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier de Charlevoix wrote that \\"it was the general opinion that no Indian had ever possessed greater merit, a finer mind, more valor, prudence or discernment in understanding those with whom he had to deal\\". Louis-Hector de Calli√®r, the Onontio (governor) that replaced Frontenac, was \\"exclusively indebted to him for...this assemblage, till then unexampled of so many nations for a general peace\\". Kondiaronk contracted a fever and died in Montreal during the negotiations for the Great Peace on August 2, 1701. A Christian convert, his body was buried at Montreal's Notre Dame Church after a majestic funeral. No trace of the grave remains. The Kondiaronk Belvedere in Montreal's Mount Royal Park is named in his honor. In 2001 he was named a Person of National Historic Significance by the Canadian government. Early diplomatic efforts Kondiaronk's first major role came in 1682, representing the Mackinac Huron tribe in negotiations between the French governor Frontenac and the Ottawa tribe which shared Michilimackinac village. Kondiaronk looked towards the French for protection from the Iroquois tribes after an Iroquois chief, a Seneca, was murdered while being held prisoner in the Michilimackinac village. Afterwards, the Huron sent wampum belts to the Iroquois to appease the murder; however, the diplomatic representative of the Ottawa told Frontenac that the Huron did not send any of the Ottawa's wampum belts. Furthermore, the Ottawa insisted that the Huron placed all the blame for the murder on them. Kondiaronk maintained his position that the actions of the Huron were only to placate the Iroquois, but the Ottawa were not convinced and French efforts to conciliate the two tribes had little effect. Despite the tensions between the Huron and Ottawa, Kondiaronk's appeal to the French did secure an alliance to stave off Iroquois military advances. 1688 coup By 1687, the French Governor General, Denonville, had taken over the land of the Senecas. Kondiaronk and the Hurons agreed to ally with the French as long as Denonville promised that war against the Iroquois would not stop until the Iroquois were fully defeated. In 1688, Kondiaronk formed a war party and traveled to Fort Frontenac on the way to raid Iroquois villages. While at the fort, Kondiaronk learned that Denonville had begun discussing peace with the Iroquois, despite his prior agreement with the Hurons that war would continue. The war party withdrew back across Lake Ontario and waited for the Iroquois Onondaga delegation to pass through on their way to Montreal. When the Iroquois diplomats arrived, Kondiaronk and his war party took them by surprise with a forest ambush. One chief was killed and the remaining Iroquois taken captive. When the prisoners explained to Kondiaronk that they were a peaceful delegation and not a war party, Kondiaronk pretended to be astonished, then angry, with Denonville's betrayal. He told the Iroquois captives, \\"Go, my brothers, I release you and send you back to your people, despite the fact we are at war with you. It is the governor of the French who has made me commit this act, which is so treacherous that I shall never forgive myself for it if your Five Nations do not take their righteous vengeance.\\" Kondiaronk's war party returned to their village at Michilimackinac with an Iroquois captive given as a replacement for a Huron killed in the skirmish. When the prisoner was presented to the French commandant at Michilimackinac, the Frenchman ordered him killed. The commandant was not aware that his government was trying to negotiate peace with the Five Nations‚Äî he was keeping in line with the current Huron declaration of war. An old Seneca slave was summoned to witness the execution of his countryman, and afterwards Kondiaronk ordered the man to travel to the Iroquois and report how badly the French had treated the captive. Since the captive was intended for adoption into the Michilimackinac village, the way his death was portrayed to the Iroquois angered them because they felt the French disrespected their tradition. Due to Kondiaronk's skillful manipulation of events, the peace negotiations between the French and Iroquois came to a halt‚Äî a satisfactory result for the Hurons. Warfare and later diplomatic efforts 1689‚Äì1701 Starting in 1689 a decade of warfare ensued known as Frontenac's War (1689‚Äì1697) that involved a series of conflicts between the French and the English. As a result of Kondiaronk's skillful manipulation, Frontenac's War included conflicts between the French and the Iroquois.Dumain, Ralph. \\"Chief Adario on the White Man's Morals.\\" Ralph Dumain: The Autodidact Project. 1999-2010 Ralph Dumain, 26 Sept. 2001. Web. 25 Feb. 2012. However, the years 1697 -1701 marked the beginning of a period of intense diplomatic activity that would lead to the Great Peace of Montreal four years later.Havard, Gilles, Phyllis Aronoff, Howard Scott, and Gilles Havard. Montreal, 1701: Planting the Tree of Peace. Montreal: Recherches Am√©rindiennes Au Qu√©bec, 2001. Print. Kondiaronk was held responsible for provoking the Iroquois to a point where it was impossible to appease them, as exemplified by the sacking of Lachine during the summer of 1689. The Iroquois, in retaliation to the French, burned, killed, and sacked plantations which left the Island of Montreal in a state of utmost dismay.Drake, Samuel Gardner. Biography and History of the Indians of North America, from Its First Discovery. Boston: B.B. Mussey, 1851. Print. However, Kondiaronk continued to prevent a separate French-Iroquois peace by any means possible despite the aggressiveness of the warrior nation, the Iroquois. In 1689, Kondiaronk was caught plotting with the Iroquois for the destruction of their Ottawa neighbors. As the Hurons were split in a pro-French faction led by Kondiaronk and a pro-Iroquois faction, in 1697 Kondiaronk warned the Miamis of an imminent attack led by Lahontan and his Iroquois allies. Kondiaronk led 150 warriors into a two-hour canoe engagement on Lake Erie and defeated a party of 60 Iroquois. This restored Kondiaronk's pre-eminence and the Hurons' place as Frontenac's children. With conflict in Europe ending with the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, New York and New France agreed to suspend hostilities. New York encouraged the Iroquois to make peace with New France. Since the Iroquois could no longer use English military threat to their advantage against New France in September 1700 they signed a treaty to make peace with Frontenac independent of New York, which led to the first step of negotiations. Kondiaronk returned to Michilimackinac and urged all the nations of the Lakes to go there the following August essentially acting as an architect of the peace of 1701. Settlement of 1701- final Indian congress The final Indian congress began 21 July 1701. The central goal was to negotiate a treaty of peace among the natives and with the French. One main conflict standing in the way of peace was the debates over the return of prisoners who had been captured during previous wars or other campaigns and enslaved or adopted. For Governor Hector de Calli√®re, the conference was the result of 20 years of diplomacy. Bacqueville de la Potherie (Le Roy), the primary source of information on these deliberations, went to Sault-Saint-Louis (Caughnawaga) to meet many of the parties at the village of the Mission Indians. The first flotilla that arrived carried nearly two hundred Iroquois, headed by the ambassadors of the Onondagas, Oneidas, and Cayugas. The Senecas had dropped by the way, and the Mohawks would follow later. The men approached, firing their guns. The salute was returned by the mission Indians, who were their close brethren, and they ranged along the shore. At the water's edge, they were greeted by a small-fire and then retired to the main council lodge where they smoked together for some time in a mood of tranquility. That evening, the \\"three rare words\\" of the ritual of requickening were presented to them ‚Äì these three concepts included the wiping of tears, clearing of the ears, and opening of the throat. The significance of this was to prepare them to begin the conference and deliberation the next day with Onontio. The next morning the Iroquois \\"shot the rapids to the main fire at Montreal, where they were greeted by the crash of artillery\\". They had scarcely disappeared when several hundred canoes carrying French allies appeared. This included Chippewas, Ottawas, Potawatomis, Hurons, Miamis, Winnebagos, Menominees, Sauks, Foxes, and Mascoutens. In total, over 700 Indians would be received to great ceremonies at the landing. The Calumet Dance was a specialty of the Far Indians, and it was done to the accompaniment of gourd rattles. The dance was greatly significant to making friends of their hosts and instilling a feeling of cooperation and alliance. By 25 July, negotiations between the tribes and the French were fully under way. Kondiaronk spoke of the difficulties and struggles encountered in the process of recovering Iroquois prisoners from the allies. He was suspicious of whether the Iroquois would comply in an exchange with sincerity or cheat them of their \\"nephews\\", that had been taken over the past 13 years of war. He was concerned that the allies would be deceived, and yet, they were so determined to make peace that they were willing to leave their prisoners to display their good faith. The next day proved telling, however, as the Rat's suspicions were confirmed and the Iroquois admitted that they did not have the prisoners that they had promised to return. They defended themselves by saying that, as small children, the prisoners had been given to families for adoption. They were, the Iroquois said, not the masters of their young people. This explanation irritated the Hurons and Miamis, as they had, in their efforts, forced their Iroquois captives away from foster families to be returned. The following days were full of deep discussion and argument. Kondiaronk, having persuaded his own and allied tribes to bring their Iroquois prisoners to Montreal, was angry and embarrassed about his failed efforts at an exchange. He returned to his hut that night and prepared to speak severely in the next day's conference about the importance of cooperation and compromise. Illness, death and legacy: 1701‚Äì1760 Amidst the deliberations that last day of July, Kondiaronk became ill, unable to stand at the conference on 1 August. He was seated in a comfortable armchair, and after having an herbal drink made of maidenhair fern syrup, he was strong enough to speak. He spent the next two hours condemning the Iroquois for their misbehavior, and additionally, recounting his own role in conflict aversion with the Iroquois, his success in prisoner recovery, and peaceful negotiations. \\"We could not help but be touched,\\" wrote La Potherie, \\"by the eloquence with which he expressed himself, and could not fail to recognize at the same time that he was a man of worth.\\" He retired to his hut after speaking, too exhausted to remain at the conference. He died at two a.m. the next day, at the age of 52. It was because of Kondiaronk's inspirational speeches that the remaining parties were convinced to sign the peace treaty, the Great Peace. When his death was announced, many Iroquois, who were well known for their death and burial ceremonies, participated in covering the body of Kondiaronk in a ritual called \\"covering the dead\\". Sixty men marched in a procession led by Louis-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, with the Seneca chief Tonatakout, carrying the rear. The procession sat in a circle around the body, and a man appointed as the chanter paced and sang for a quarter of an hour. After him, a second speaker, Aouenano, wiped away the tears of the mourners, opening their throats, and pouring in a sweet re-quickening medicine. Then, after producing a belt, he restored the Sun and urged the warriors to emerge from darkness to the light of peace. Afterwards, he covered the body, which would be permanently covered later, during the Christian burial ceremony. Kondiaronk was, after all, a convert of the Jesuits. His funeral was elaborate, and both natives and French took part. French representatives were paired with delegations of a segment of Huron-Petun society. Marching in front of the coffin were a French officer, sixty soldiers, sixteen Huron warriors, and French clergymen. The coffin was carried by six war leaders, and was covered with flowers. There rested upon the top of the coffin a gorget, a sword, and a plumed hat. Behind the coffin, Kondiaronk's relatives followed, along with the Ottawa and Huron-Petun chiefs. The wife of the intendant, Mme. De Champigny, the governor of Montreal, M. de Vaudreuil, and the entire officer corps were at the rear of the procession. The war leaders, at the grave, fired a salute. The inscription on his resting place read: Cy git le Rat, Chef des Hurons (\\"Here lies the Muskrat, Chief of the Hurons\\"). Today, there is no remaining trace of this burial place, though it is thought that he lies somewhere near the Place d'Armes. The French idealized the deceased chief, using him to demonstrate what all chiefs should aspire to be like. They compared him to French leaders and institutions, which painted a picture of idealized chiefs who would direct consensual politics, and rule with non- coercive authority. The French envisioned these chiefs as the governors of small principalities, and emissaries of the French government. This comparison and French ideology would remain a source of tension between the natives and France until French Canada's fall in the mid-eighteenth century. In fact, Pennahouel, an Ottawa chief who consulted with General Montcalm in July 1757, was compared to Kondiaronk, and \\"celebrated for his spirit, his wisdom\\" and his easy conversation with Frenchmen. Kondiaronk was preserved in literature, as Adario in the Baron de Lahontan's Voyages (1703). As a result of this, he became the model for all the \\"noble natives\\" who were thereafter recorded in European literature.

History During the 80's‚Äì90's, David Harbour was well known to the listeners as a virtuoso bass player of David T. Chastain, Michael Harris and Tony MacAlpine bands, as well as a participant of Leather and Chastain bands. In the mid-nineties Harbour began to pay more attention to the piano, his first musical instrument, which he began to play as early as five years of age. Several years of work in this direction resulted in that in the late nineties, David Harbour decided to implement some of many musical ideas he got in his arsenal, in the form of an instrumental solo album. According to the information from an older version of his site, the original working title of his forthcoming album was Lost for Words. The recording itself of the album was delayed for some time, due to the fact that in late 1999, David received an invitation to join King Diamond group. After recording with this group its album House of God (2000) and the completion of the tour in support of it, Harbour left King Diamond and started working seriously on his own solo album. He placed two demos on his official website and said that besides being a composer and a bass guitarist he was also going to play all keyboard and piano parts on this album. The first solo album of David Harbour was released in the beginning of 2003. The disc named Ideology presented ten instrumental tracks composed by David. Style and mood With the release of Ideology album, David Harbour completely changed the established view of himself as a musician and a performer. Despite logical expectations to get a solo album of a virtuoso bass player, the audience was presented a work of a strong pianist and composer, where bass served only as another melodic voice. There are also three purely piano pieces in the album: \\"Liberation\\", \\"Broken\\" and \\"Obelisk\\", in which David plays as if he were trying to break bars ‚Äì a sure sign of musical impressionism. On his first solo work, David Harbour easily avoided virtually all musical limits, demonstrating the possibility of combining the most differentiate musical styles. On Ideology, elements of rock music, jazz, progressive rock, impressionism, and new age are harmoniously interwoven. However, the term \\"fusion\\" is not a good definition in this case because the compositions of Harbour are made in more \\"atmospheric\\" key, with more influence of art rock, progressive and classic music than of jazz.

Ohio University revealed the new mascot during a ceremony before the Bobcats' victory over Tennessee- Martin on . At the suggestion of a university alumnus, Michael Massa, Class Of 1982, a University-wide contest to name the bobcat took place in 2006. The unveiling ceremony began with a video of the mascot interacting with the football team and Head Coach Frank Solich culminating with Rufus roaring into Peden Stadium on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. In October 2014, coinciding with a space conference being held on campus, Rufus the Bobcat was the first college mascot's name to venture into deep outer space aboard an unmanned NASA spacecraft, carrying a CD library of names. In 2020, Ohio University launched its first actual space sattelite ‚ÄúBobcat-1‚Äù aboard NASA‚Äôs Antares rocket, to the international space station. Bobcats are strictly wild animals. These 2‚Äì4 month old kittens live out of a tree like many bobcat babies. Rufus has helped efforts to prevent hunting and endangerment.  Nomenclature  In early 2006, Ohio University alumnus Michael A Massa, a communications graduate, penned a letter to the athletics department suggesting that the university provide a proper name and identity to the generic bobcat mascot, for branding purposes. The university Athletic Department then held a campus-wide competition to select a formal name. There were more than 500 submissions nominated for the name of the new Bobcat in May. Fans then participated in a naming contest on www.ohiobobcats.com from June through August, the chosen name of the Bobcats' new mascot was Rufus. The winner of the naming contest, Alicia Lagana (‚ÄòBSJ 90, MS ‚Äò92, now Alicia Anderson-Lasker) of Hilliard Ohio, was recognized at the Ohio University home game versus Bowling Green on September 30, 2006. Rufus was the popular choice for many fans because Lynx rufus is the species name for the bobcat. Other fans made the connection with Rufus Putnam, who presided over the meeting to form the Ohio Company of Associates that resulted in the founding of Ohio University.Hulbert, Archer Butler: The Records of the Original Proceedings of the Ohio Company, Volume I, Marietta Historical Commission, Marietta, Ohio (1917).Hulbert, Archer Butler: The Records of the Original Proceedings of the Ohio Company, Volume II, Marietta Historical Commission, Marietta, Ohio (1917). Rufus Putnam was also on the first board of trustees at the University from 1804 to 1824, and was given the honor with the naming of Putnam Hall in 1926. In October 2014, coinciding with a major space conference being held on campus, Rufus the Bobcat was the first college mascot name to venture into deep interstellar space, after his name was submitted by Michael Massa to be included among the names of other individuals on a registry to be transported on board the Mars regionally bound Orion NASA test Spacecraft. In 2017, Rufus' name was also included on the actual NASA spacecraft entitled \\"Insight\\", which was slated to land on Mars, being the first university mascot's name to be included in the voyage to another planet in our solar system.  Ohio Bobcats and mascots  In 1925, the members of the Ohio Athletic Board thought of an official nickname for Ohio University to replace \\"Ohio,\\" the \\"Green and White\\" and \\"The Nameless Wonders.\\" The board members decided to begin a contest soliciting name suggestions for the Athletic teams of Ohio University and offered a $10 prize for the suggestion that best showed the fighting spirit of Ohio. Hundreds of ideas poured in, but it was \\"Bobcat,\\" suggested by Hal H. Rowland, a former student and Athens resident, that suggested the winning name. The bobcat's regal stature in Appalachia made its selection a highlight of Ohio University's strategic partnership with the region. The Bobcat mascot first appeared at Ohio's Homecoming game against the Miami Redhawks on . That day, the Ohio football team overcame archrival Miami with a 21‚Äì0 victory. They went on to achieve arguably the university's greatest football season ever. The Bobcats finished 10‚Äì0 that year and were voted the NCAA National College Division Champion. The task of designing the Bobcat mascot costume was given to Tom Schantz. The outfit he created included a very green hand-knit sweater with ‚ÄòOHIO‚Äô emblazoned in white across the front, and was literally topped off by a large papier-m√¢ch√© head made in France. The question of who would wear the costume was complicated by the fact that the suit was hot, confining and had awkward dimensions. Dan Nichols, class of '63, was the first Bobcat mascot and began the tradition that the person donning the costume must live in Lincoln Hall, a tradition that lasted for several decades. The Campus Affairs Committee decided that the Bobcat mascot would be a permanent member of the cheerleading squad and would be present at all football and basketball games. Rufus has transcended his courtside profile further by becoming a beacon of spirit for alumni, charities, and university campaigns.  Brutus tackling  On September 18, 2010, the Bobcats football team played the Ohio State Buckeyes in Columbus. As the Buckeyes were running onto the field, Brandon Hanning, dressed as Rufus, charged into the field. Hanning sideswiped and attempted to tackle Brutus Buckeye, but was unsuccessful and ended up losing his Bobcat head in the process. Upon returning to his feet, Hanning donned the head again, then ran after Brutus and jumped on his back and continued to hit the mascot in the head. Hanning was then pulled aside by security who told him to cut it out. Neither of the mascots were injured during the event. After the game, Hanning was terminated from his position as Ohio's mascot, and was banned from attending Ohio home athletic events. The game score went 43‚Äì7 in the Buckeyes' favor. In a post-game interview, Hanning explained that this was his sole purpose in trying out to be the mascot. \\"It was actually my whole plan to tackle Brutus when I tried out to be mascot,\\" Hanning explained, \\"I tried out about a year ago, and the whole reason I tried out was so I could come up here to Ohio State and tackle Brutus.\\" While many thought this was Rufus' first offense against rival school's mascots, Hanning stated \\"Before this, I actually got in a fight with the Buffalo mascot. He's a bull. I started it. I was thinking I should go ahead and try out tackling another mascot. I brought a red square cape thing, like in a bullfight. He was just playing around, acting like he was charging me. I tackled him and put him on the ground. It was pretty funny. No one got upset because it wasn't Ohio State.\\" Following the game The Columbus Dispatch published a cartoon of a scrawny Brutus mascot lifting weights next to a picture of their next opponent's mascot in reference to being taken by surprise by Rufus the game before.

Oman has an embassy in Sana'a. Both countries are members of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. History During the early 1970s relations between Oman and the neighboring People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) deteriorated, following conflict in Dhofar Province with a guerrilla organization, known from 1974 as the People's Front for the Liberation of Oman, which the South Yemeni government supported. Although a cease-fire was mediated by Saudi Arabia in March 1976, the situation remained tense. The PFLO threat diminished further with the establishment of diplomatic relations in October 1983 between South Yemen and Oman, and South Yemen subsequently lessened propaganda and subversive activities against Oman. In late 1987, Oman opened an embassy in Aden, South Yemen, and appointed its first resident ambassador to the country. After the Gulf War rapprochement between united Yemen and neighboring Oman took place. After North and South Yemen merged in May 1990, Oman settled its border disputes with the new united Republic of Yemen on October 1, 1992. Oman also hoped to take part in Yemen's oil development. In September 2008, the two countries began discussions to form a regional center to combat piracy. In May 2009, Oman signaled support for Yemen's integrity and the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh by withdrawing the Omani citizenship of southern Yemeni politician Ali Salim Al Bidh, who was believed to be stoking separatist sentiment in south Yemen.Oman: Reform, Security, and U.S. Policy.

From aviculture to zoology  From a young age on his family estate in Sterrebeek, Derscheid developed an interest in ornithology and aviculture. He built a research station for bird behavior called Armendy Farm that was active in the 1930s. In cooperation with colleagues in France, England, Germany, the United States and Australia he succeeded in assembling one of the best captive breeding bird collections in Europe, specializing in Anatidae and Loriinae (ducks, swans, geese; and the group of small parrots consisting of lories and lorikeets).Yealland, John. 1940. ‚ÄúThe Collection at Sterrebeek.‚Äù Avicultural Magazine (5th series) V:251-254.Barclay-Smith 1945:157. Derscheid also kept the omnivorous alpine parrots from New Zealand known as keas.Yelland, John. 1940. ‚ÄúSome Parrot-Like Birds at Sterrebeek.‚Äù Avicultural Magazine (5th series) V:288-293).Derscheid, J.M. 1947. \\"Strange parrots I. The Kea (Nestor notahilis Gould).\\" Avicultural Magazine 53:44-50. There, he researched dietary requirements and incubation, sending specimens to zoos throughout Europe, America, and Australia. He was particularly interested in aspergillosis, a bronchial disease caused by mold that decimated flocks of wild sea ducks as he tried to acclimatize them to the freshwater park environment, but which Derscheid succeeded in curing.Yealland, John. 1949. ‚ÄúMycosis in Birds.‚Äù Avicultural Magazine 55:20-22. Derscheid's techniques were widely adopted and applied, most notably at the nature reserve in Zwin (Belgium), known for its collections of salt-resistant plants and an aviary specializing in wading birds. An obituary of Derscheid states: ‚ÄúHis collection at Sterrebeek was known throughout Europe, America and Australasia, and his success with the Anatidae, particularly with the sea-duck, placed him in the forefront of waterfowl experts.‚ÄùBarclay-Smith 1945:157. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Derscheid transferred some of his collection of exotic birds to the late John J. Yealland, who carried them in a cardboard box on one of the last boats to leave Belgium before the German invasion.Harvey, Mary. 1983. ‚ÄúJohn James Yealland 1904-1983‚Äù (Obituary).

From 1919 to 1922 Derscheid was enrolled in the Science Faculty of the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, studying under Professor Auguste Lameere and earning a doctorate in Zoology based on his dissertation on the morphology of bird skulls (Morphologie du squelette c√©phalique des oiseaux).Brien 1971:211-235.

Conservation efforts in Europe and internationally  Early 20th-century European efforts to lobby internationally for environmental conservation laws were delayed by World War I, but Belgian biologist Jean Massart reintroduced Paul Sarasin's proposals at the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS) in the 1920s. Professor Michel Siedliecki promoted them in Poland and helped to get the issue onto the agenda of the IUBS meetings of 1925, 1926, 1927 and 1928.Brien 1971. In 1927 Siedliecki, Derscheid and P.-G.

Africa's first national park and the Akeley-Derscheid expedition  Through his understanding of the importance of habitat conservation for wildlife in Europe and his professional work on Congo at the museum in Tervuren, Derscheid became an instrumental figure in lobbying for the creation of the first national park in Africa, formally proposed in 1925.Akeley 1929:119.Akeley, Mary L.

Carl Akeley died on November 18, 1926, only three days after the expedition arrived at Kabara, on the slope of the volcano Mount Mikeno.Akeley 1931:293.

She repeatedly refers to the expedition as the Akeley-Derscheid expedition in her book, although the financial backers of the expedition are named in the title.Akeley 1929:xii, 222, 232, 250. The Parc national Albert was ceremonially opened on October 19, 1930. It was placed under the authority of an Administrative Council with twenty-one members, with the Prince Albert de Ligne as president and Derscheid as secretary. A board was also created for which Jean-Marie Derscheid was named director.Akeley 1929:297. From January 1 to May 1, 1930, the president and director undertook a second mission to the park in Congo to prepare for international collaboration and to research other areas of the colony in which new reserves could be established. In November and December 1930, Derscheid traveled to the United States, attending conferences at various institutions to promote the Albert National Park and its opportunities for scientific research as well as to generate financial support. He resigned in December 1933, after administrative conflicts arose over bookkeeping errors, and devoted himself to teaching biology at the Universit√© coloniale at Antwerp, where he had been named Professor on January 14, 1930.Brien 1971. Derscheid continued to pursue historical research on Rwanda and Eastern Congo until 1939, corresponding with colonial administrators stationed there and creating a research manuscripts collection that was subsequently microfilmed, digitized and which is available online. He was working at the university when war broke out again.  World War II and resistance activities  In 1939, Derscheid was mobilized, rejoining his army medical corps unit in the 7th Infantry Division.Liste des personnes ayant aid√© des aviateurs pass√©s par Com√®te. After taking part in operations at Albert Canal, a defensive line, he was evacuated to France. There his unit was demobilized and in August 1940 he returned to Sterrebeek, where he found his family estate occupied by German soldiers, who treated the remains of his exotic duck collection as game.Brien 1971 Derscheid then contacted the resistance and established ties with a secret army unit, U.C.-L.-55, associated with the university in Antwerp, the reconnaissance services SRA (Service de Renseignements de l‚ÄôArm√©e) and with the London authorities by the autumn of 1941. He directed a radio communications service with England using secret codes based on the Swahili and Lingala languages.Liste des personnes ayant aid√© des aviateurs pass√©s par Com√®te.

However, along with others at the university, he came under suspicion and the Nazi secret police tried to force him to give himself up by imprisoning his wife, Jeanne Brasseur Derscheid (twice) and his parents as hostages at Saint Gilles prison.Barclay-Smith, Phyllis. 1953. \\"Obituary: Madame Jeanne Derscheid.\\" Avicultural Magazine 59(1):17. On October 8, 1941, he taught his last class; on the night of the 17th the GFP secret police arrested him in Brussels. He was extradited to Germany in January 1942 for what became thirty months in various prisons and concentration camps. A Japanese colleague, ornithologist Hatchisuka Masauji (who had accompanied him on one of his trips to Congo), used his influence with Emperor Hirohito to persuade the Germans to spare Derscheid's life.Delacour, Jean. 1953. \\"Obituary: Masauji, 18th Marquess Hachisuka.\\" Auk 70:521-522. When the Nazi government recognized that it was losing the war, Jean-Marie Derscheid was decapitated on March 13, 1944, in Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison under the orders of Heinrich Himmler.Christoffel, R. 1944.

The 9-day celebration of Ohio brewing brings together brewers and beer lovers from all around the nation to sample beers and celebrate the joy of craft brewing. It is a week full of the celebration of ‚Äúcraft beer and Ohio pride.‚Äù More than 26 different breweries located around Ohio showcase their beer at restaurants, bars, and breweries in uptown Athens. These breweries include: Great Lakes Brewing Co. in Cleveland, Rhinegeist Brewing Co. in Cincinnati, and a local favorite, Jackie O's Brewery in Athens. Events, concerts, and competitions are held throughout the week as well as barbecue cookouts, multiple happy hours, dinners, \\"meet the brewer\\", pool tournaments, tastings, golf outings, karaoke, corn hole tournaments, trivia, a haunted tour, and other activities.  Locations  More than 35 businesses that consistently support and serve the Brews of the Week. Many other local bars and restaurants participate as well. Some continuous supporters are: ¬∑ Athens Country Club ¬∑ Broney‚Äôs Alumni Grill ¬∑ Casa Nueva ¬∑ The CI ¬∑ Jackie O‚Äôs Brew Pub ¬∑ Lucky‚Äôs Sports Tavern ¬∑ The Oak Room ¬∑ The Ohio University Inn & Conference Center ¬∑ Pawpurr‚Äôs ¬∑ The Pigskin Sports Bar and Grill ¬∑ The Union ¬∑ Zoe History Ohio Brew Week started when businesses lost their customers (students) in the summer due to school being out and students going home for the summer. Businesses needed a reason to bring back students or the people living in Athens and surrounding cities. Two local Athens residents began Ohio Brew Week in 2005. That week had more than 70 craft brews sold by 26 proprietors, mostly in uptown Athens. In 2015, the 10th anniversary, they saw record crowds and beer sales. It‚Äôs safe to say that no matter the director, people in Athens love the Ohio Brew Week and the fun activities it has to offer. The Ohio Beer Week expanded as craft beers became plentiful in grocery stores. Now, you can find craft beers in grocery stores. In 2016, more than 45 Ohio breweries participated in Ohio Brew Week. The 2017 festival will feature more than 200 types of beers. 2020 saw no crowds as the Brew Week went virtual for the first time caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Events Ohio Brew Week attracts national attention each year. Each year brings different speakers to highlight the different breweries or beers offered. Some keynote speakers have been: * Alan Eames, the late ‚ÄúIndiana Jones of Beer‚Äù * Steve Hindy, president of Brooklyn Brewery (and former Athens Messenger paperboy) * Joe Tucker, executive director of RateBeer.com * Pat Conway, co-founder of Great Lakes Brewing Company A big tradition held at Ohio Brew Week is the Homebrew Competition. Participants may enter their own home- brewed beer to be judged and ranked among other participants brew entries. Judges will choose the best Brews among several categories. Another fun tradition is the Athens Cuisine Showcase. Beer makers come together to sample others' beers. The entries must be made with or served with one of the week's craft beers. In another event, the Brew Barbecue Cook-Off, contestants vie to win barbecue and craft beer competitions. The entries can either consist of meals served with beer or made with beer. Boogie on the Bricks, a community music and arts street fair, often concludes Brew Week. This Community Music & Arts Street Festival held on the bricks of Athens. The week closes with a street dance featuring an eclectic array of musicians.

He was the foreign minister of Colombia from 1970 to 1974. Carrizosa was the son of General Alfredo Vasquez Cobo, the Conservative Party's candidate for President of the Republic in 1930. He did his secondary and higher education in Belgium and graduated as a lawyer at the Catholic University of Leuven. He was linked during the decade from 1930 to the International Labour Organization, becoming the Colombian delegate during World War II, when its offices were relocated to Canada. On his return to Colombia, he was elected to the House of Representatives for Cundinamarca, but steered clear of the Conservative Party's internal divisions. He was uninvolved, therefore, in the coup d'√©tat of 1953. From 1958, during the reign of the National Front, Carrizosa continued his diplomatic career as Ambassador of Colombia to the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United Nations and the Organization of American States, until he attained the post of foreign minister in 1970. After leaving the Foreign Ministry, Carrizosa devoted himself entirely to the cause of human rights, founding (and, from 1979, chairing) the Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights. In 1991, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Colombia, representing the leftist movement Patriotic Union as its oldest constituent. He died in Bogot√° on December 19, 2001.

He is a professor at the Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics in the Department of Physics, UC Berkeley. He is known for the Bousso bound on the information content of the universe. With Joseph Polchinski he proposed the string theory landscape as a solution to the cosmological constant problem. Life and Career Bousso was born in Haifa, Israel, the son of late scientist Dino Bousso. He grew up near Augsburg, Germany, where he studied physics from 1990 until 1993. He earned his Ph.D. at Cambridge University in 1997; his doctoral advisor was Stephen Hawking. Bousso did postdoctoral research at Stanford University until 2000, and at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara until 2002. In 2002/03, Bousso was a fellow at the Harvard University physics department and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Since 2002 he has been a professor in the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley. In 2012, Bousso was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society \\"for fundamental discoveries in the field of quantum cosmology, including the covariant entropy bound and the string landscape.\\" Research Bousso's research is focused on quantum gravity and cosmology, particularly through the study of quantum information. His 1999 covariant entropy bound (Bousso bound) established a general relation between quantum information and the geometry of spacetime (i.e., gravity). The Bousso bound has since been refined and strengthened, leading to provable new results in quantum field theory, such as the quantum null energy condition. Bousso has also worked on the black hole information paradox (firewall problem). Since 2018, he has led a consortium of theoretical and experimental physicists exploring and developing the relations between quantum gravity, quantum information, and quantum computing. In 2000, Bousso and Joseph Polchinski argued that string theory has many long-lived vacua, including solutions compatible with the observed positive value of the cosmological constant (vacuum energy). This came to be called the \\"landscape of string theory.\\"L. Susskind, \\"The anthropic landscape of string theory\\", . He has developed an approach to the cosmological measure problem, with the ultimate goal of testing the string theory landscape.

She breached the feudal customs of the time, which hindered women's rights, by working to educate herself in subjects such as astronomy, mathematics, geography, and medicine. She was well known for her contributions in astronomy, mathematics, and poetry. She was an acclaimed scholar: \\"An extraordinary woman of 18th century China.\\" Biography =Early life and family= Wang's ancestral home is in Anhui province, but her grandfather's family moved to Jiangning or present-day Nanjing. She was very fond of reading when she was a child and was very clever. Her family consisted of her grandfather, grandmother, and her father. Her grandfather Wang Zhefu (), was a former governor of Fengchen county and Xuanhua District. He had a broad and profound intellect with a deep love for reading and had a collection of over seventy-five bookshelves. Her father Wang Xichen failed the imperial examination and instead studied medical science and recorded his findings in a four-volume collection called \\"Yifang yanchao\\" (Collection of Medical Prescriptions). Her grandmother's maiden name was Dong. Her grandfather was her first teacher in astronomy; her grandmother was her teacher of poetry; and her father taught her medicine, geography, and mathematics. Wang Zhefu died in 1782 and the family traveled to Jiling (close to the Great Wall) for his funeral. They stayed in the region for five years, which is where Zhenyi gained extensive knowledge from reading her grandfather‚Äôs collection of books as well as learning equestrian skills, archery, and martial arts from the wife of a Mongolian general named Aa. At the age of sixteen, Wang Zhenyi traveled south of the Yangtze river with her father until she moved back to the capital. She was able to see places like Shaanxi, Hubei, and Guangdong, broadening her horizons and enriching her experiences. When she was eighteen, she made friends with female scholars in Jiangning through her poetry and began focusing on her studies in astronomy and mathematics, most of which were self-taught. At age twenty-five she married Zhan Mei from Xuancheng in Anhui province. After her marriage, she became better known for her poetry and knowledge in mathematics and astronomy that she once taught to some male students. Wang Zhenyi died at age twenty- nine and had no children. Academic achievements Although she only lived to be twenty-nine, Wang Zhenyi was very accomplished in the academic world. She excelled in astronomy and mathematics. One of her contributions was being able to describe her views of celestial phenomena in her article, \\"Dispute of the Procession of the Equinoxes.\\" She was able to explain and simply prove how equinoxes move and then how to calculate their movement. She wrote many other articles such as \\"Dispute of Longitude and Stars\\" as well as \\"The Explanation of a Lunar Eclipse.\\" She commented on the number of stars; the revolving direction of the sun, the moon, and the planets Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, and Saturn; as well as describing the relationship between lunar and solar eclipses. Not only did she study the research of other astronomers, but she was also able to do her own original research. One of her experiments to study a lunar eclipse included placing a round table in a garden pavilion, acting as a globe; she hung a crystal lamp on a cord from the ceiling beams, representing the sun. Then on one side of the table she had a round mirror as the moon. She moved these three objects as if they were the sun, earth, and moon according to astronomical principles. Her findings and observations were very accurate and recorded in her article, \\"The Explanation of a Solar Eclipse.\\" In the realm of mathematics, Zhenyi mastered trigonometry and knew the Pythagorean theorem. She wrote an article called \\"The Explanation of the Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometry,\\" where she described a triangle and the relationship between the shorter leg of a right triangle, the long leg, and the triangle's hypotenuse all correctly. She admired the mathematician Mei Wending (1633‚Äì1721 A.D.). He was famous in the early Qing dynasty and wrote the book, Principles of Calculation. Wang Zhenyi became a master of this book, rewriting it with simpler language, and made it available to others under the title, The Musts of Calculation. She was able to simplify multiplication and division to make learning mathematics easier for beginners. She was very dedicated in her study of mathematics and wrote a book called The Simple Principles of Calculation when she was twenty-four. Her studies were difficult and she once said, \\"There were times that I had to put down my pen and sigh. But I love the subject, I do not give up.\\" Poetry Her travel experiences as well as her academic research gave her plenty of ideas and material for her poetry. She left a lasting impression through her literature. She left thirteen volumes of Ci (poetry), prose, and prefaces and postscripts written for other works. The famous Qing dynasty scholar Yuan Mei commented on Wang‚Äôs poetry by saying it, ‚Äúhad the flavor of a great pen, not of a female poet.‚Äù Zhenyi‚Äôs poetry was known for its lack of flowery words, common to feminine traits. Her poetry included her understanding of classics and history and experiences during her travels, such as sceneries and the lives of commoners whom she made acquaintances with. Some examples of her work are: ‚ÄúTransiting Tong Pass‚Äù So important is the doorway, occupying the throat of the mountain Looking down from the heaven, The sun sees Yellow river streaming ‚ÄúClimbing Tai Mountain‚Äù Clouds overcast the hills, The sun bathes in the sea. She also depicted the hard lives of commoners, especially those of laboring women in poems like ‚ÄúWoman Breeder of Silkworm‚Äù and ‚ÄúClothes Washing.‚Äù In addition, she portrayed corruption and the polar contrast between the lives of the rich and poor in poems like ‚ÄúA Poem of Eight Lines,‚Äù which contained: Village is empty of cooking smoke, Rich families let grains stored decay; In wormwood strewed pitiful starved bodies, Greedy officials yet push farm levying. Death Wang Zhenyi died at the age of twenty-nine. There is no exact record of how she died. When she knew she was dying, she gave her works and manuscripts to her best friend, Madam Kuai (1763‚Äì1827 A.D.) who eventually passed them on to her nephew, Qian Yiji (1783‚Äì1850 A.D.), who was a famous scholar of the time. He compiled her work into Shusuan jiancun or Simple Principles of Calculation. He described Wang Zhenyi as the \\"number one female scholar after Ban Zhao.\\" Legacy Wang Zhenyi believed in equality and equal opportunity for both men and women. She wrote in one of her poems: It's made to believe, Women are the same as Men; Are you not convinced, Daughters can also be heroic? She was very happy in her marriage and she believed social feudal values were inappropriate \\"when talking about learning and sciences, people thought of no women,\\" she said that \\"women should only do cooking and sewing, and that they should not be bothered about writing articles for publication, studying history, composing poetry or doing calligraphy.\\" [Men and women] \\"are all people, who have the same reason for studying.\\" In 1994, the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature approved naming crater on Venus Wang Zhenyi after her.

It is the only operating Jewish cemetery in Hamburg and still used for burials according to the Jewish ritual and tradition. It is adjacent to the large non- denominational Ohlsdorf Cemetery where more than 1.5 million people are buried. History and description The Jewish Cemetery in Ohlsdorf was opened on 30 September 1883. The burial ground of the Sephardi Jews are rather special because of the remarkable and striking architectural elements. The Jews who had been expelled from Portugal and Spain around 1490 took their burial tradition along with them when immigrating to Hamburg: tombs, grave stones laying flat on the ground and stones in a sarcophagic style. In June 1937, the Jewish cemetery at the Grindelquarter was completely destroyed by the Nazis. Under the conduct of chief rabbi Dr. Carlebach, only 200 stones could be transferred to Ohlsdorf and about 175 gravestones from the cemetery Ottensen in 1939 and 1941. Male visitors are requested to wear a head covering. Kippahs can be borrowed from the green box at the entrance gate and should be replaced when leaving the cemetery.

Construction started in October 2010 and was finished in March 2011. The building is located on the Lindholmen campus, where it is connected to the neighboring buildings Jupiter and Science Park by two walkways on the first floor. The Kuggen building's name means to serve as a link between the academic world at Campus Lindholmen and all companies expanding rapidly in fields such as mobile data communications, integrated vehicle and logistics solutions and modern media design. Design Front view of Kuggen The skin is made of six different shades of red and two shades of green which is executed in glazed terracotta. ‚ÄùKuggen‚Äù is circular to minimize the ratio between skin and area. Every floor level adds two bays making the building grow in size for every added floor. The center of each circle is shifted so the southern elevation gets the longest shadow. A movable sunscreen tracks the sun and adds to the shade to the two top floors. (Existent buildings cast their shadows on the lower levels). Green building Kuggen makes use of green building technology on four different levels: adaptive ventilation, adaptive lighting, interactive heating and cooling systems, and effective daylighting. The ceramic panels used for the facade were chosen for their longevity. The windows are triangular allowing daylight to follow the ceiling deep into the building while staying at a low ratio (30%) of the elevation surface. The result is a building aiming at an energy consumption of 60 kW/y/sqm well below what is considered a green building, while providing state of the art comfort (temperature within individual offices range between 22-26 degrees Celsius).

Designed by Kay Fisker in collaboration with C. F. M√∏ller and Svenn Eske Kristensen, it was built between 1943 and 1958, during the transition from Traditionalism to Modernism, as a notable example of Nordic Functionalism. History Dronningeg√•rden was built as the result of one of the first and largest condemnation initiatives in Copenhagen. The area around Borgergade and Adelgade had escaped both the Great Fires of 1728 and 1795 but the old houses, many of which dated from the late 17th or 18th century had fallen into disrepair and their gardens and courtyards were built over, transforming the neighbourhood into the most notorious slum in the city. In 1939 it was decided to renew the area. Demolition began in the early 1940s. Dronningeg√•rden was one of the residential projects which was planned in the area. The two western corners were built during World War II, but the project was put on hold in 1943 and the eastern part was not completed until 15 years later. Architecture Dronningeg√•rden is characterised by a Functionalist design that balances monumentality with local tradition. The four L-shaped buildings are 9 storeys tall and are built in red machine-moulded brick with detailing in yellow brick. Bricks are laid in the English bond with recessed joints. The west and east sides of the complex, which run parallel to Adelgade, are broken up by alternating gabled sections with open, recessed balconies, and inter- connecting sections decorated with cross motifs in yellow brick. The interior sides of balconies and entrances are clad in yellow brick. The original intention was to build Dronningeg√•rden in yellow brick to resemble the buildings that had been demolished. However the design was shaped by the shortage of materials during the war and red brick was chosen instead. The arches above the windows were chosen to minimize the need for cement and iron. Urban space The tall, homogeneous facades, define the four sides of a central urban space. This arrangement was inspired from the English garden squares. The use of gables on two sides of the complex serves to enhance Dronningens Tv√¶rgade as an axis. The concept with two intersecting axes bears testament to the planning of nearby Frederiksstaden around two axes, along Frederiksgade and Amaliegade, which intersect at the central plaza of Amalienborg Palace.

They contain a total of 160 apartments. Contrary to the original intentions, the central space is today mainly used for parking.

The two countries at one time did enjoy good relations and closely cooperated in military, economic and cultural issues.Saudi-Yemeni Relations: Domestic Structures and Foreign Influence By F. Gregory Gause p.4 Columbia University Press Now because of the ongoing Yemeni Civil War and the realignments of power in the Middle East with the emergence of al-Qaeda and the radicalization of some factions of Islam, Saudi Arabia has led a military intervention into Yemen, alongside a nine-member coalition, backed logistically by the United States, using airstrikes inside of Yemen and commencing a naval and aerial blockade beginning March 26, 2015, in order to support the current government of Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi in the war against the Houthis. History Modern Saudi-Yemeni relations began in 1803 with an attack by Saudi forces of the territory of Zaydi Imamate with the help of some local Yemeni tribes. The Saudis won and had control over the Tihama region until 1818 when the forces of the Ottoman khedive of Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha, destroyed the Saudi state.Saudi-Yemeni Relations: Domestic Structures and Foreign Influence By F.

Over these three fraught decades, Yemen's relationship with Saudi Arabia oscillated between low points like Saleh's siding with Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War, to deepening Saudi sponsorship during the first decade of the War On Terror. Saleh's falling out of Saudi favor was a contributing factor to his fall from power in 2012. His attempt to regain power by allying with the Houthis, who he had once used the Saudi Air Force to bomb, eventually led to his assassination in December 2017. =Border= In September 2003, in an effort by the Saudi government to control incursions by Yemenis into Saudi Arabia and slow terrorist actions, the Saudis began construction of a wall of cement-filled pipeline, 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter along its border with Yemen. Following, complaints by the Yemeni government to the Saudis that construction of the wall violated a year 2000 treaty between the two nations, the Saudis stopped work on the wall in February 2004. But by that time, 47 miles (75 kilometers) of cement-filled barrier, of the 1,100 mile (1800 kilometer) border had been erected.

The press has compared Youssef with American comedian Jon Stewart, whose satire program The Daily Show inspired Youssef to begin his career. In 2013, he was named as one of the \\"100 most influential people in the world\\" by Time magazine. Youssef's current projects are Tickling Giants, The Democracy Handbook, and Revolution For Dummies. Medical career Bassem Youssef graduated from Cairo University's Faculty of Medicine, majoring in cardiothoracic surgery, in 1998. He passed the United States Medical Licensing Examination and has been a member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) since February 2007. He practiced as a cardiothoracic surgeon in Egypt for 13 years, until his move into comedy and political satirism. He also received training in cardiac and lung transplantation in Germany, after which he spent a year and a half in the US working for a company that produces medical equipment related to cardiothoracic surgery. In January 2011, Youssef assisted the wounded in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution. Youssef has credited surgery for making him \\"a much harder working person, a nerd, a perfectionist.\\" Media career =The B+ Show (March 2011)= Inspired by the Egyptian revolution of 2011, Youssef created his first satirical show in March 2011. The initial idea came from his friend Tarek ElKazzaz. Entitled The B+ Show after his blood type, the program, at 5 minutes per episode, was uploaded to his YouTube channel in May 2011 and gained more than five million views in the first three months alone. The show was shot in Youssef's laundry room using a table, a chair, one camera, and a mural of amateur photos from Tahrir Square that cost $100. The show was a collaboration by Youssef with Tarek ElKazzaz, Amr Ismail, Mohamed Khalifa, and Mostafa Al-Halawany. Youssef used social media to showcase his talent and his show gave a voice to the millions of Egyptians who were seething with anger from the traditional media's coverage of the Egyptian Revolution. =Al Bernameg Season 1 (September 2011)= After the success of The B+ Show, Egyptian channel ONTV, owned by Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris, offered Youssef a deal for Al Bernameg (literally, \\"The Program\\"). Youssef had planned to move to Cleveland to practice medicine but instead signed his show's contract. With a budget of roughly half a million dollars, the series made him the first Internet to TV conversion in the Middle East. The show, which consisted of 104 episodes, premiered during Ramadan 1432 (2011) with Egyptian-American engineer Muhammad Radwan as its first guest. In his show, Youssef has parodied such Egyptian celebrities as show host Tawfik Okasha, composer Amr Mostafa, Salafist presidential candidate Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, and Mohamed ElBaradei, former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and onetime presidential candidate. The show became the platform for many writers, artists, and politicians to speak freely about the social and political scene. Al- Bernameg's success inspired a number of amateur initiatives on various social media channels, who credit The B+ Show as their inspiration. =The Daily Show 2012= In June 2012, Jon Stewart invited Youssef to The Daily Show for an extended interview, \\"...I do know a little something about the humour business; your show is sharp, you're really good on it, it's smart, it's well executed, I think the world of what you're doing down there,\\" Stewart said to Youssef. The segment was one of the highest in viewership on the Daily Shows website. =Al Bernameg Season 2 (November 2012)= Following the success of The B+ Show on YouTube and the first season of Al-Bernameg on ONTV, Tarek ElKazzaz convinced an old friend, Ahmed Abbas, to join QSoft as chief operations officer and Project Director for Al-Bernameg with the mission of developing and upgrading the show into a multifaceted and global brand. This was done with the help of a team that covered many disciplines, including marketing, operations, legal and public relations. This all helped in developing both Bassem Youssef and Al-Bernameg on all levels and created a global audience. The show Al Bernameg was renewed for a second season after a contract with a second channel, CBC (Capital Broadcast Center), which premiered on November 23, 2012. The second season consisted of 29 episodes and has recorded one of the highest viewership ratings on both TV and internet with 40 million viewers on TV and more than 184 million combined views for his show on YouTube alone. Just three episodes into the show, several lawsuits were filed against Bassem Youssef and his show, mainly for \\"insult and defamation\\". On the season's premiere, Youssef made the owner and coworkers of his channel the subject of his show, as an assurance that he is granted full freedom of expression, and that no topic was off limits. CBC did not, however, air his second episode, which also featured further criticism of a TV show host who filed a lawsuit against Youssef. The show returned to its regular schedule for the third episode. The program, which began with a small group working at home with Youssef, moved from ONTV's smallest studio to Radio theater in downtown Cairo, a theatre redesigned in the likeness of New York's Radio City, making it the first live audience show in the Middle East. The contents of a typical show's broadcast have evolved, which began with a sarcastic take on current political events, and eventually incorporating the hosting of public figures and stars from various fields, as well as various artists' performances. In November 2012, Al-Bernameg moved from ONTV's smallest studio to Radio Theatre in Cairo's downtown. Following the move, Youssef succeeded in increasing the show's worth by eight times in one year.ONTV (Egypt) The second season, which premiered in November 2012 on CBC network, was the first real live audience show in Egypt. The show gained tremendous success through its criticism of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, representing the Muslim Brotherhood. Soon after the show started airing, complaints were filed against Youssef, accusing him of insulting Islam, Morsi and disrupting public order and peace. =Al-Shorouk= In March 2013, Bassem Youssef started writing a weekly column expressing his views for Al-Shorouk; one of Egypt's most prominent and independent daily newspapers. Youssef also wrote newspaper columns, where he tackled taboo subjects such as atheism and questioning the commonly held view that apostasy from Islam should be punishable by death. On March 18, 2014, he faced plagiarism accusations by his readers, and through Twitter, by the original British writer, Ben Judah, who wrote the article for Politico magazine. He later published an apology in El Sherouk newspaper for initially publishing an article without citing any references. =America in Arabic= As Al-Bernameg continued with its growing success, Jon Stewart appeared as a guest on the show in June 2013. On 1 July 2013 America in Arabic (United Arab Emirates) debuted. He appeared for the second time on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. =CBC stops airing= After a four-month break, Youssef appeared on air in October 2013, with a show that stirred much controversy and criticism. In response to the popular criticism and discontent the show caused, CBC, the show's broadcaster, distanced itself from the show and its creators, and decided to stop airing it on its channels. Meanwhile, more than 30 complaints against Youssef and the show were filed at the General Prosecutor's office, accusing him of insulting the Egyptian Armed Forces and President Adly Mansour and describing the June 30 protests as a military coup, in addition to disrupting public order and peace. The General Prosecutor transferred some of the complaints for investigation, which were subject to the prosecutor's decision and judgment. =Al Bernameg Season 3 (October 2013)= After terminating the contract with CBC, the production company behind Al Bernameg received offers from different TV channels. The third season was scheduled to air during the first quarter of 2014. In February 2014 it was announced that Youssef had signed a deal with the Middle East Broadcasting Center and that they would start broadcasting Al Bernameg from 7 February on MBC MASR. However the program was suspended by MBC during the 2014 Egyptian presidential election campaign, and in June 2014 Youssef announced that he was ending Al-Bernameg as he felt that the political climate in Egypt was too dangerous to continue the show. After a four-month break, Al Bernameg returned to air for its third series on 25 October 2013. The season premiere marked the first broadcast for the show since the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat had deposed Mohamed Morsi from the Egyptian presidency. Youssef criticised both the Morsi administration and the people's idolization of the Egyptian Defense Minister Abdul Fatah al-Sisi. The following day the CBC network issued a statement distancing the channel from the political stance taken by Youssef. The CBC network issued another statement, and decided to stop broadcasting Al Bernameg because of violations in the contract signed. Al-Bernameg reappeared on MBC Masr satellite channel on February 7, 2014, achieving unprecedented weekly viewership ratings for 11 consecutive weeks. In June 2014, and after a six-week break, the Al-Bernameg team held a press conference where Youssef announced the termination of the show due to pressure on both the show and the airing channel. Life in the USA: 2014-present In January 2015, Harvard's Institute of Politics (IOP), at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, announced that Youssef would be a resident fellow for the spring semester. In February 2015, it was announced that Youssef was collaborating with The Daily Show producer Sara Taksler to launch a crowd- funding campaign for her documentary about his experience, Tickling Giants. Youssef stated that he couldn't say no to her request to do the documentary as, \\"at the time, she was working at the Daily Show, and I didn't want to say no to anybody working with Jon Stewart. So I basically said \\"yes\\" to be on his good side, but I discovered it didn't really make any difference ...\\" In November 2015, Bassem hosted the 43rd International Emmy Awards in New York City. In the fall of 2016, Youssef was a Visiting Scholar at Stanford University's Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law (CDDRL). His research interests were stated as \\"political satire and its role in disrupting political, social and religious taboos.\\" In February 2016, it was announced that Youssef had reached a deal with Fusion to produce a digital series, Democracy Handbook with Bassem Youssef. The show premiered online and in a one-hour broadcast special in mid-July 2016. Tickling Giants, a documentary film about Bassem Youssef directed by Sara Taksler, premiered on April 14, 2016, at the Tribeca Film Festival. John Oliver and Ed Helms were moderators for Q&As; at screenings in Los Angeles. It became available for purchase in June 2017. The film is available for streaming on Netflix in 30 countries (excluding Canada and the US as of September 2019). Unsurprisingly, it is not legally circulated in Egypt. In 2017, Youssef guest-starred in the DuckTales reboot episode \\"The Living Mummies of Toth-Ra!\\" as the titular pharaoh. The podcast Remade in America debuted In early 2018, in which Youssef explores the cultural, political, and social nuances of America from an outsider's perspective. In June 2018, Youssef conducted his third Ask Me Anything on Reddit, having previously done so in 2017 and 2015. In 2019, Bassem Youssef began the YouTube channel PlantBtv. His new online show combines his comedic, medical, and vegan background. It seeks to educate both Arabic and English audiences on nutrition and food science as it connects to health and wellbeing. Bassem Youssef has done a variety of public speaking events in the US and Canada. He has also appeared on a variety of US media outlets. He has been interviewed for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, has twice appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and has been interviewed by Larry King and Trevor Noah. As of fall 2019, Youssef has regular standup comedy shows in San Francisco. His comedy for the western audience has a focus on immigration, refugees, terrorism, and the Arab experience in America. Response of Egyptian government On 1 January 2013, the daily Al-masry Al-youm reported that an Egyptian prosecutor was investigating Bassem Youssef on charges of maligning President Mohammed Morsi, whose office claimed that Youssef's show was \\"circulating false news likely to disturb public peace and public security and affect the administration.\\" Despite all of the controversy it sparks, Al Bernameg has been a major success. It is constantly topping the regional YouTube charts, making Bassem Youssef's YouTube channel the most subscribed to in Egypt. On 30 March 2013, an arrest warrant was issued for Youssef for allegedly insulting Islam and Morsi. The move was seen by opponents as part of an effort to silence dissent against Morsi's government. Youssef confirmed the arrest warrant on his Twitter account and said he would hand himself in to the prosecutor's office, jokingly adding, \\"Unless they kindly send a police van today and save me the transportation hassle.\\" The following day, he was questioned by authorities before being released on bail of 15,000 Egyptian pounds. The event sparked international media attention as well as a segment on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show in which he declared his support for Youssef, calling him a \\"friend\\" and \\"brother\\". After Al Bernameg ended, the Egyptian police raided the offices of the production company, arresting several employees and confiscating their computers. According to Youssef, the police told producer Amr Ismail that they would continue harassing the company if Youssef did not stop speaking publicly at international conferences. The Egyptian courts then levied a E¬£50 million fine against Youssef in a contract dispute with CBC. In the verdict, the courts condemned satirical television shows and implied that Youssef was disrupting the peace and inciting public unrest. Fearing he would be arrested if he stayed in Egypt, Youssef fled to Dubai in November 2014. Awards In 2013, Youssef was named one of the \\"100 most influential people in the world\\" by TIME magazine and one of Foreign Policy magazine's 100 Leading Global Thinkers. In November 2013, Youssef's role in the media was recognized by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which awarded him with the International Press Freedom Award, along with three other journalists. In 2015, Youssef received an honorary degree and delivered the commencement address for the College of Online & Continuing Education at Southern New Hampshire University.

Along with the Aboriginal community of Weemol, away, Bulman is considered a closed community and visitors require a permit from the Northern Land Council to transit or visit the town. The combined population of Bulman and Weemol at the 2011 census was 291 and is one of few significant settlements on the Central Arnhem Road between Katherine and Nhulunbuy. Facilities in the town include a school, health clinic, police station and an all weather airstrip.

This species of crab is native to many coasts off of the western Atlantic Ocean. It has been found to be native to areas as far as Florida, to as southern as Uruguay. U. cordatus is especially noteworthy in the country in Brazil as it plays important roles in the economy and food resources at Brazil‚Äôs Atlantic borders. Like most other crabs, U. cordatus has two distinct pinchers for different uses. Its left sharp pincher functions to cut and feed and the other pincher, is much larger and used to crush objects. It has an oval back with a very unique color scheme. U. cordatus is one of many animals that have sexual dimorphism. Most noticeably, female crabs are larger than their male counter parts. Males have a flatter oval shaped back with a distinct light blue in the middle with a beige white encompassing its back. On the other hand, females have much larger bulbous backs. Their carapaces are a dull dark green with dark purple. Both genders legs are also a dark reddish purple.  Habitat  Ucides cordatus is from the mangrove crab genus, and such are primarily found in mangrove forests. They are largely terrestrial, and will create their homes at the bases of trees in the form of burrows. These burrows have been seen to be as deep as 1.6 meters down. The burrows have been found to play an important role in balancing carbon dioxide in mangrove forests. The increase in sedimentary surface area allows for a greater area for oxidation to occur, especially during the rain season. While it has been documented to eat animal remains U. cordatus is primarily a herbivore. The diet of U. cordatus largely consists of mangrove litter (ie. leaves, bark, roots etc.). It has been noted that U. cordatus prefers certain mangrove species. U. cordatus has been found to prefer Rhizophora mangle over Avicennia germinans, but the reasons for this preference is unknown. On the other hand, U. cordatus has few predators. Animals known to hunt U. cordatus include, but are not limited: raccoons, monkeys, and hawks. With such few predators, populations of U. cordatus tend to grow quite well because of this. However, populations of U. cordatus is also greatly exploited by locals, primarily in Brazil. The overall U. cordatus population has seen a steady decrease since 1988. Unlike most animals, the proportion of genders within populations are skewed in favor of the males. Studies have found the ratio of females to males is 53-62% respectively.  Behavior  Like many other crabs, U. cordatus will migrate during mating season, which occurs during the months of November to January. They will leave their burrows to reach the ocean coast. In doing so, they create the migration phenomenon known as ‚Äúa andada‚Äù which is Portuguese for ‚Äòthe walking‚Äô. At the coast, the crabs will both mate and lay their eggs. At which point they return to their origin. Conservation efforts  Ucides cordatus can play important roles in determining and empirically quantifying successful mangrove reserves. They are well known for being a sentinel species, and efforts to determine their biological changes have been common methods by which researchers have determined effectiveness of reserves. Environmental changes such as increase of heavy metals, fertilizer runoff, and other xenobiotics have been correlated back to U. cordatus and their biological status. There are also legal restrictions to capturing U. cordatus. Due to their popularity, and decreasing population sizes, some states of Brazil have enacted restrictions of the size of crabs people are allowed to hunt. States like Paraiba have laws preventing the capture of females crabs smaller than 4.5 cm. However, according to many gatherers, these laws are not entirely enforced.

It is a suborder of primitive sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks. Description These snails have mostly conically coiled shells in which the spire is typically low to moderate in height. More rarely the shell is discoidal in coiling. The outer lip simple. The internal layers of the shell are aragonitic and nacreous, in some species completely so. The operculum, where known, is calcareous or corneous, and spiral in structure.Knight J. B. et al. (1960). Systematic Descriptions, Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. Part I(1). Taxonomy J. Brookes Knight, et al., in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology divided the Trochina into five superfamilies: the Anomphalacea, Microdomacea, Oriostomatacea, Platyceratacea, and Trochacea, based on stratigraphic occurrence and features of shell anatomy without trying to extrapolate from molecular data. The first four superfamilies are exclusively Paleozoic, although the Oriostomatacea may extend into the Triassic. The Trochacea extends from the Triassic into the Recent. Members of the Trochina are included in the vetigastropods although originally by Knight et al. in the Treatise, they were considered to be a suborder within the Archaeogastropoda. While this earlier approach may differ from more recent attempts, and may be no more phylogenetically accurate, it does provide a useful scheme for studying this group of animals. The taxonomy of Bouchet and Rocroi (2005) did not used Trochina at all and they considered Trochina as an available name.

Site selection involves measuring the needs of a new project against the merits of potential locations. The practice came of age during the 20th century, as governments and corporate operations expanded to new geographies on a national and international scale. History Site selection was formalized in the 1940s and 1950s through a number of important U.S. government projects. Determining the correct location for projects important to national security, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Hanford Site, and the United States Air Force Academy, required a thorough evaluation process. The site selection process developed for these projects was refined and later became standard practice in the private sector. As the U.S. economy and population expanded in the post-war years, so did corporate operations. Large companies began using a formal site selection process to identify ideal locations for new corporate campuses and, in particular, manufacturing operations. Literature on site selection theory used to look until recent years at the various issues only from a national point of view. By and large, there are no international reviews to be found in these publications. In the US, a country in which industrial site selection played a role very early on, resulting in a very early search for methodical approaches, Edgar M. Hoover was one of the leading pioneers in the field of site analysis. In his book \\"The Location of Economic Activity\\", Hoover compiled crucial criteria of industrial site selection as early as 1948 that still apply today. There were, however, some quite early attempts to combine theories of international trade with nationally oriented site theories in order to develop a site theory with an international perspective. One of these early authors was Ohlin (1952), followed by Sabathil (1969), Moore (1978), Tesch (1980), and Goette (1994). Nevertheless, even to this day, this situation has only changed to some extent. Even though since the 1990s it has no longer been only major corporations that expand abroad, and any foreign direct investment results in a site selection, there are still very few well- researched studies on this topic. A specifically international site selection theory is still not discernible. Many current and more recent publications either review site decisions made by individual corporations or analyze them as reference cases. Other publications focus on a cost-specific approach largely driven by site relocations in the context of cost structure optimization within major corporations. However, these publications only rarely and at best cursorily deal with issues of construction and real estate aspects. Theodor Sabathil's 1969 dissertation is considered one of the early in-depth studies in the area of international site selection. Therein, Sabathil largely focused on country selection, which is part of the site selection process. In this context, Sabathil compiled a comprehensive catalogue of site factors and a theoretical approach to site selection; the latter does not go into great detail. Neither does Sabathil take any legal, natural, or cultural site factors into consideration. However, he discusses in particular company-specific framework conditions and psychological factors.Glatte, Thomas 2015. Location Strategies: Methods and their methodological limitations Journal for Engineering, Design and Technology, Volume 13, Issue 3, p. 435 - 462 The dissertation submitted in 1980 by Peter Tesch constitutes another milestone in the further development of international site theory. Tesch combines theories of international trade and investment with site theories. He is the first to include country-specific framework conditions in his analysis. The main basis for his comments on the various types of internationalization are location-specific competitive advantages. In this context, Tesch developed a catalogue of criteria for international site decisions grouped into three categories: ‚Ä¢ site factors affecting all company activities ‚Ä¢ availability and costs of the site factors impacting on the production factors ‚Ä¢ turnover-related site factors. Thomas Goette's 1994 study tries to classify important international site factors and to structure the process of international site selection. Goette distinguishes between economic site conditions (sales potential, competitive conditions, infrastructure and transportation costs, labor, monetary conditions), political site conditions (tax legislation, environmental protection, institutional market entry barriers, support of business, political risks), cultural site conditions (differences in language, mentality, religion, and the lack of acceptancy of foreign companies), and geographical site conditions (climate, topography). This study again demonstrates that an attempt to cover all aspects will result in loss of quality as all factors were not or could not be taken into consideration. Goette also theorizes that, in particular, industrial site decisions within companies are usually once-off and division- related decision-making processes. Based on this, Goette assumes a relatively low learning curve, and hence little potential for improvement for subsequent projects. As one of the last major contributions, Thomas Glatte aimed to enhance and globalize the known systems in his book \\"International Production Site Selection\\" by providing a 10-staged selection process, suggesting selected methods for each selection stage and offering a comprehensive list of criteria for the practitioner.Glatte, Thomas 2013. Industrial Production Site Selection Expert Verlag, Renningen, Germany Notable projects United States Air Force Academy The United States Air Force was created in 1947 as an independent service branch and legislation was passed to create a United States Air Force Academy. Selecting the best location for the academy was deemed critical by Congress and the Air Force Academy Site Selection Board was established to manage the task. The board evaluated more than 580 locations in 22 states before selecting the current Colorado Springs site. Hanford Site Site selection for the Hanford nuclear production facility was important for different reasons. Nuclear material and nuclear weapon production required land suitable for large-scale manufacturing, but also remote and secure from natural disasters. The Army Corps of Engineers selected 586 acres in Southwest Washington in 1942. BMW automotive manufacturing In 1992, BMW announced the company would invest over $620 million to develop a new manufacturing facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The factory was the first by a European car manufacturer in the United States since Volkswagen had closed its Pennsylvania facility in 1992. BMW spent three years evaluating over 250 sites before selecting South Carolina. Process The site selection process includes a detailed evaluation of project needs which are then measured against the merits of potential locations. The process typically includes selecting and evaluating communities, real estate site analysis and acquisition, and may include negotiating tax incentives. According to the U.S. General Services Administration, site selection considerations should begin early in the capital development process and play a significant role in pre-planning discussions. The process includes the following steps: # Define project criteria # Evaluate communities # Create short list of communities based upon project criteria # Identify real estate sites within each finalist community # Real estate analysis # Negotiate tax incentives # Site acquisition Detailed site selection typically requires nine months for federal projects and four to six months for private sector projects. The National Environmental Protection Act may extend the site selection timeline for federal agencies, depending on the level of environmental analysis required. Current use Formal site selection is widely employed today. The U.S. federal government and all federal agencies require new facility development to follow internal site selection procedures. While not as widespread, many state governments and state government agencies have followed suit and published their own site selection guides. Without requirements for use, site selection for private business is still widely used, but less so than in federal agencies. In private industry, site selection consultants are hired for complicated projects including manufacturing facilities, corporate headquarters, and research and development operations. For both government and business, the work can be performed by internal staff or an external advisors. Many large corporations with ongoing new facility needs employ internal site selection teams.

The band is composed of five members; lead vocalist Daniel Winter-Bates, rhythm guitarist and singer Jason Cameron, bassist Davyd Winter- Bates, drummer Adam Jackson and lead guitarist Kristan Dawson, who replaced founding guitarist Mehdi Vismara in 2013. Bury Tomorrow have released six studio albums, their most recent being Cannibal, released on 3 July 2020. History =Formation and debut album Portraits (2006‚Äì2010)= The band was formed in 2006 in Hampshire, England, with their initial line-up consisting of rhythm guitarist and singer Jason Cameron, drummer Adam Jackson, lead vocalist Daniel Winter-Bates, bassist Davyd Winter-Bates (his brother) and lead guitarist Mehdi Vismara. The band ‚Äì despite reading in press that \\"metalcore\\" had become a dirty word of such ‚Äì was adamant to prove that metalcore was still relevant. Davyd Winter-Bates has said comment on their interest to the style by saying \\"since day one we have been really proud and vocal about calling ourselves metalcore\\". In 2007, they self-released their debut EP The Sleep of the Innocents. Their debut album Portraits was released through Basick Records in Britain in October 2009. Two music videos were shot to support the release of the album but only one, \\"You & I\\", was broadcast on music channels. The music video for \\"You & I\\" was recorded at Southampton Solent University and featured Bury Tomorrow performing to 200 fans, the video was shot over the course of two days, with the second day focusing on the band performing. \\"You & I\\" was broadcast on MTV2 in the United States, Scuzz in the United Kingdom and on Much Music in Canada. Portraits was then released through Artery Recordings in March 2010 in Japan and the United States. Bury Tomorrow toured continuously over the course of 2010, touring across the United States, Europe and Japan. In their tours in 2010, the band supported Asking Alexandria, Of Mice & Men, Sleeping with Sirens, and Pierce the Veil. =The Union of Crowns and Vismara's departure (2011‚Äì2013)= Bury Tomorrow's vocalists Jason Cameron (left) and Dani Winter-Bates (right) performing in 2012 In 2011, the band felt a large amount of pressure from their American record label, Artery Recordings. Initially trying to convince the band to move and base themselves in the United States, Bury Tomorrow's band members felt the label was trying to manipulate them and change them into something they were not by suggesting they should incorporate more electronic elements into their style. While they rejected moving as they had little experience in the country; communication broke down between them and Artery Recordings and through a series of emails the band lost their North American and Japanese record label as well as their American agency. The only person that remained in their team was their British agent, and she was quoted as saying: \\"Nobody wants to touch you. No bands even want to take us on tour.\\" The band was so low on money that they could not even afford to go to the studio to record the album they had written in 2011. Their agent managed to get them performances at Slam Dunk Festival and Ghostfest in Leeds. At this point Bury Tomorrow's members had such a lack of confidence in the band's future that they believed these would be their final shows. Their performances at these festivals were met with a positive response from fans, which restored a lot of their lost confidence. At Ghostfest, Bury Tomorrow met their future band manager who suggested that they shelf the album they had been writing. Instead, they wrote and recorded \\"Lionheart\\", the first single for what would later become their second album, released on 8 September 2011 and accompanied by a music video released on 13 September. Bury Tomorrow supported British metalcore band While She Sleeps in October, with a follow up UK headline tour in December. On 6 December, two days before the band started the headline tour, a video was released for their single \\"Royal Blood\\", directed by Thomas Welsh. \\"Royal Blood\\" was later broadcast on Radio 1 on Christmas Eve during its daytime programme. Bury Tomorrow spent the first few months of 2012 recording their second album, with only a few tour dates in the first half of 2012 to support the album's release. Starting on 18 March by headlining Southampton's Takedown Festival, they went on to support Of Mice & Men and appear at Hit The Deck Festival in April before appearing at Greenfield Festival on 17 June and at Ghostfest in Leeds on 30 June. In April 2012, Bury Tomorrow announced that they had signed to Nuclear Blast and confirmed the album art, track listing and release date of their second album, The Union of Crowns. The band said that signing to the new record label allowed them to record it the way they wanted to, which they would not be able to do with their old label, Artery Recordings. The album was recorded in Ridgeway Sound Studio in Wantage and was released on 13 July in Europe, 16 July in the United Kingdom and 17 July in the United States. Two singles were released in 2012 to promote The Union of Crowns: \\"An Honourable Reign\\", which was premiered on BBC Radio 1 and \\"Knight Life\\". In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 6 on the Rock & Metal Chart, and in the United States, it peaked at number 25 on the Top Heatseekers chart and sold 1,062 copies in its first week. Bury Tomorrow played a single date on 10 July at the Camden Underworld supporting I Killed the Prom Queen on their European tour, before appearing at Hevy Music Festival in early August. They also toured Britain with Architects in November alongside Deez Nuts and The Acacia Strain. This tour was wrapped around both Bury Tomorrow's and Architects' appearance at UK Warped Tour, including at Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012. In late January 2013, the band announced that lead guitarist Mehdi Vismara had left Bury Tomorrow and that Kristan Dawson would assume his position. They described Dawson as a much more technical and riff-heavy guitarist, saying that this complements the band's stylistic ideas for their third album. In February, the band supported The Ghost Inside on the \\"Rock Sound Impericon Exposure Tour\\" across the UK. Vocalist Dani Winter-Bates made a guest appearance on the song \\"Broken Lights\\" from Heart in Hand's album Almost There, which was released on 11 February. Drummer Adam Jackson at Summerblast Festival 2014 Bury Tomorrow ended the promotion of The Union of Crowns in 2013 after appearing at several festivals, including Slam Dunk, Download, Greenfield, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Summerjam, Schools Out, Pell Mell and SummerBlast, as well as touring both in the UK in September and outside of the UK. Rock Sound praised their performance at Leeds Festival, writing: \\"They came as underdogs, but given the reception they're afforded this afternoon, it's safe to say that Bury Tomorrow will be leaving with more than a few new friends.\\" Bury Tomorrow then went to the United States in October to write and record their third album. =Runes (2014‚Äì2015)= Lead guitarist Kristan Dawson (left) and bassist Davyd Winter- Bates (right) at Summerblast Festival 2014 On 6 January 2014, Bury Tomorrow announced the release of a third studio album, titled Runes, on 26 May through Nuclear Blast, as well as the release of an exclusive track from the album, titled \\"Watcher\\", which premiered on the Radio 1 Rock Show at midnight on 6 January. They also announced a headline European tour with Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!, Demoraliser and Napoleon, taking place in May. The music video for the first single from Runes titled \\"Man on Fire\\" was released on 25 February, followed on 13 May by \\"Of Glory\\". The album itself was made available for exclusive streaming by Rock Sound on 21 May 2014 a few days before its release on 26 May. By 1 June 2014, it had reached number 1 on the official UK Rock chart and number 34 in the official UK Album chart. Later in June, the band announced another European headline tour, set for October, with support from Hands Like Houses, In Hearts Wake and Slaves. In February 2015, they toured the UK with Don Broco, We Are the in Crowd and Beartooth as part of that year's Kerrang! Tour. =Earthbound (2016‚Äì2017)= Bury Tomorrow live at Summer Breeze Open Air in 2016 While performing at Slam Dunk North 2015, Bury Tomorrow announced that they had just finished working on their fourth full- length album, but did not reveal when it will be released. At Reading and Leeds Festival 2015, they debuted the first song from the album. On 1 November, they officially released the song, titled \\"Earthbound\\" and accompanied by a music video. At the same time, the band announced that their fourth album, also titled Earthbound, is set for release worldwide on 29 January 2016 through Nuclear Blast. On 9 January 2016, three weeks before the album release, the band released the second single of the album \\"Last Light\\" and its corresponding music video. On 15 February, Bury Tomorrow signed to UPRAWR Music Publishing. On 25 November, nine months after the album release, the band released a music video for the song \\"Cemetery\\" and made it as the third and last single of the album. In an interview with Dead Press! on 15 April 2017, frontman Dani confirmed that the band had written some of the follow-up to Earthbound and that they plan on recording at some point later in the year. In the same interview, he also disclosed that the band intend to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Portraits in some way once it comes about in 2019. =Black Flame (2017‚Äì2019)= On 27 October 2017, the band left Nuclear Blast and confirmed their signing with Sony Music and Music For Nations. During the months of October and November, the band headlined their \\"Stage Invasion\\" tour with metalcore band Loathe as their support act. On 13 April 2018, the band released the lead single and title track \\"Black Flame\\" along with an accompanying music video. That same day, the band revealed the tracklist, album's official artwork and announced that their fifth studio album, the first distributed by the new labels, Black Flame is set for release on 13 July 2018. On 1 June, the band released the second single \\"Knife of Gold\\" and its corresponding music video. On 29 June, two weeks before the album release a music video for the song \\"The Age\\" and made it as the third and last single of the album. On 14 June 2019, the band announced the deluxe edition of Black Flame which contains the bonus track \\"Glasswalk\\" and live versions of three songs from the original album while also released the bonus track \\"Glasswalk\\" as a new single of the album. =Cannibal (2019‚Äìpresent)= In an Instagram Q&A; with their fans, guitarist/vocalist Jason Cameron confirmed that a new album will be released in 2020. On 29 November 2019, the band released the lead single of their upcoming album titled \\"The Grey (VIXI)\\" and its corresponding music video. On 10 January 2020, the band released the second single and title track \\"Cannibal\\" along with an accompanying music video. That same day, the band revealed the tracklist, album's official artwork and announced that their new upcoming sixth studio album Cannibal is set for release on 3 April 2020. On 13 February, the band released the third single of the album titled \\"Choke\\". On 20 March, presumably due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic concerns, the band announced that they delayed the release of the album to 3 July in a bid to help them properly promote it. On 2 April, the band released the fourth single \\"Better Below\\" along with an accompanying music video. On 26 June, a week before the album release, the band released their fifth single \\"Gods & Machines\\". Musical style Bury Tomorrow have been described as metalcore, melodic metalcore, and post-hardcore. AllMusic writer Gregory Heaney wrote: \\"Offsetting layers of pleasant, atmospheric melody with sudden bursts of chugging heaviness, the band uses its breakdowns to create a brooding, moody effect, as if the songs are lurching into a fit when provoked from their somber ruminations.\\" Vocalist Daniel Winter-Bates has stated that he likes the ability of his band to go \\"heavier\\" and \\"lighter\\" with ease. This is reinforced through vocal styles, in a manner typical of many metalcore bands; whereas Winter-Bates performs a harsh mix of screaming and growling, guitarist Jason Cameron contrasts this with melodic singing, usually in the chorus of a song. The band has referred to older metalcore bands as their primary source of influence, with Metal Hammer journalist Merlin Alderslade commenting on their style by saying \\"the quintet's blend of fierce, melodic death metal-inspired and gloriously anthematic choruses was seen as of the crowning achievements of a new generation of metal bands that had been weaned on a diet of The End of Heartache, Waking the Fallen and Reroute to Remain.\\" Prior to the release of their third album, Runes, Bury Tomorrow have said that it is going to be more technical, \\"old school\\" and in line with artists like As I Lay Dying and Killswitch Engage than their previous releases.

They are also available in a sugar-free version. It is an over-the-counter drug, available at many retail stores, including drug stores, grocery stores and mass merchandisers. It provides relief from heartburn and indigestion (\\"sour stomach\\").  History  In 1928, James Harvey \\"Jim\\" Howe (born 1873 College Corner, OH & died 1960 Webster Groves, MO), pharmacist in St. Louis, Missouri, developed Tums in the basement of his home while treating his wife's indigestion. The remedy caught on, and commercial production began in 1930 by the Lewis-Howe Company, which took its name from Howe and his uncle, A. H. Lewis, who was a pharmacist in Bolivar, Missouri; Howe worked in his uncle's drugstore as a teenager. Tums plant in St. Louis (2018) In 1978 the company was purchased by Revlon of New York, making it no longer a St. Louis-based company. Revlon's Norcliff Thayer unit oversaw the Tums brand. Revlon spun Norcliff Thayer off to Beecham Group in 1986, and Beecham eventually became GlaxoSmithKline through a series of mergers. Since 1930, a plant originally built by Lewis-Howe in downtown St. Louis has been making the antacid tablets. The factory complex remains the main manufacturing site for Tums, and GlaxoSmithKline recently completed millions of dollars' worth of renovations and modernizations.  Medical uses  Since Tums is an over-the-counter drug, it is not considered a pharmaceutical-grade treatment (does not require a prescription). Prescription strength acid reflux medications often contain Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine2 receptor blocker (H2 blockers) / H2 antagonist.What are the effects of long-term use of acid reflux medications?  Advertising  Famous advertising campaigns for Tums have included \\"Tums for the Tummy\\" and, much later for television, \\"Mother Tums\\" (\\"There, there!\\") and by a barbershop jingle sung to the theme music used in all versions of the TV crime drama series Dragnet.  Varieties  Tums comes in chewable tablets that are taken orally. It is also available in different flavors such as peppermint and fruit flavors such as berries, orange, and cherry.

The wall, which comprises 7,200 tiles, is wide and high. Design The elements in the mural are colorful and fanciful creatures. The mural was produced by Joan Gardy Artigas. He created the 7,200 tiles based on a design by Mir√≥ involving surreal figures and animals. Artigas had to work from an image which Mir√≥ had created at one- tenth the scale of the finished wall. Using that model, he marked out each section on an individual tile. The artwork was completed in 1979 and includes the signatures of both artists at the bottom, left-hand corner. Mir√≥'s signature is undated; Artigas' signature is dated 1979. Artigas was a second generation surrealist. His father had been a ceramicist for both Picasso and Mir√≥. When Artigas' father wanted to retire, Mir√≥ brought the younger Artigas back from exile in France, where he had been avoiding the Spanish Francoist regime. Artigas junior worked with Mir√≥ for twenty years creating other similar sized murals for UNESCO, IBM and the Palacio de Exposiciones y Congresos in Madrid. The mural was opened at the same time as the new museum was built. It was in the town's market place and had been constructed to hold the art collection of the Cologne businessman, Wilhelm Hack, whose collection had been given to Ludwigshafen. Hack saw the new museum as he died in 1985. Construction The tiles were fired in Gallifa, a village near Barcelona. They had to be transported to the museum. Because of the terrain, they were placed four to a box so they could be carried down the mountain by mule. After that, the tiles were transported by lorry and train to complete the journey from Catalonia (Spain) to south western Germany.

By 2002, PAX had become the largest non-lobbying organization working on gun violence prevention as a result of the success and rapid expansion of its ASK and SPEAK UP campaigns, which were designed to have immediate impact on the frequency of gun deaths and injuries, while also shifting the national dialogue around guns to a prevention-driven, public health and safety orientation. In 2011, PAX officially changed its name to The Center to Prevent Youth Violence[7] to better reflect the youth and family focus of its prevention driven campaigns. In 2012 the organization was merged with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, and Daniel Gross became President of the Brady Campaign. Talmage Cooley resigned as co-CEO of The Center to Prevent Youth Violence in 2004 but remained on the organization's Board of Trustees until its merger with the Brady Center in 2012. Since inception, CPYV has created groundbreaking public health and safety campaigns that promote the simple steps parents, kids and others can take to prevent violence affecting youth, including gang-related and other urban violence; school shootings; suicides, accidents and homicides involving firearms which claim the lives of eight children and teens every day.  Parent-focused Programs  CPYV has created two parent-focused problems aimed at educating parents about simple steps they can take to reduce the risk of violence affecting their children. = ASK = The ASK Campaign was launched by the gun violence prevention organization PAX (renamed The Center to Prevent Youth Violence in 2011 and merged with the Brady Campaign in 2012). The ASK campaign was originally developed by Talmage Cooley and Daniel Gross, co-founders of PAX/The Center to Prevent Youth Violence, and launched in 2000 in conjunction with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). It is now managed by The Brady Campaign. The campaign raises awareness among parents about the importance of asking if there are guns where their children play, to ensure guns stay out of kids‚Äô hands. The program also emphasizes the importance of medical and health professionals to talk to parents and patients about guns in the home, gun safety and safe storage. For more information about the program, visit http://www.askingsaveskids.org/.[22] In partnership with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the ASK Campaign's goal is to encourage parents to ask if there are guns where their children play (i.e. the homes of friends and relatives). The ASK Campaign includes television and radio public service announcements and collateral materials that inform parents and inspire them to ask about the presence of firearms in the homes where their children play. If the answer is yes, then parents are encouraged to make sure they are stored securely in a place that is inaccessible to children. Community-based ASK Campaigns have been implemented in Rockford, IL and in Portland, OR. The ASK Campaign is also observed nationally on National ASK Day, June 21 of each year. In 2011 a major ASK Day event was held in Miami, Florida in response to the recently passed ban on physicians asking their patients about the presence firearms in the home. The event encouraged parents to ask themselves, since physicians were restricted in their ability to do so. The ban has since been blocked. By 2017, the ASK and SPEAK UP campaigns had been active for over 17 years, and remain the leading public health and safety campaigns dedicated to gun violence prevention in the US, with over 19 million Americans signing the ASK Pledge (www.askingsaveskids.org) and over 31 million parents reporting that they ask their neighbors about guns where their kids play.[9] = GAO Report Praising ASK Campaign Effectiveness 2017 = In October 2017, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on the effectiveness of firearm storage awareness programs, ultimately finding the ‚ÄúASK‚Äù program to be the only national safe storage program that has been independently evaluated and found to be effective. The report, entitled ‚ÄúPersonal Firearms: Programs that Promote Safe Storage and Research on their Effectiveness,‚Äù was prepared over a two-year period in response to a request by the Congressional HELP (Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions) Committee. The report also points out that funding for gun violence prevention research is disproportionately low relative to health issues with comparative mortality rates. According to the report, government-funded research for gun violence is .7 percent of that for sepsis, which has a comparable mortality rate, and the publication volume for studies on firearm-related deaths is about four percent of that for sepsis. The report evaluated 16 programs, both regional and national, that are aimed at spreading awareness of the importance of safe storage of firearms. The ASK campaign was found to be the only national program that effectively promotes awareness of safe storage through its parent-centered program that urges caregivers and parents to ask if there are guns safely stored in the homes where their children play. The NRA‚Äôs Eddie Eagle program, aimed directly at young children, was found to have no effect on participating children‚Äôs behavior around guns. Jim Accomando, president of National PTA, said ‚ÄúChild and school safety starts at home. When families store their guns responsibly, they‚Äôre much less likely to end up in schools and tragedies are less likely to occur. It is critical that guns are kept safely away from kids and that we, as parents, ask if there are guns in the homes where our children play. National PTA is proud to support the ASK campaign to help prevent gun-related incidents and keep children safe. The association is also committed to advocating for legislation and appropriations to research the causes and effects of gun violence. In order to fully understand and address this epidemic gripping our nation, we need to first understand the causal relationships and the effects such violence has on our communities.‚Äù HELP Senate Committee leaders lauded the report‚Äôs findings. ‚ÄúThere is so much we can and absolutely should be doing to address gun violence‚Äîbut as this report makes clear, one simple, critical step is to gain a better understanding of how to encourage the safe storage of guns,‚Äù said Senator Patty Murray (D-WA).‚ÄúI‚Äôm hopeful that every Senator will take a close look at the findings in this nonpartisan report, and join families nationwide in pushing for stronger investments in gun violence research.‚Äù \\"If we want to stop this tragic scourge of gun violence, we need better information about what is causing it and what can be done to prevent it,‚Äù said Senator Ed Markey (D-MA). ‚ÄúWe need to study gun violence like the public health crisis that it is. This new GAO report outlines how important it is to give the medical, scientific, and public health community the resources they need and support a federal research agenda into gun violence. I thank the Brady campaign for their leadership on this issue and look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make critical investments in protecting lives.\\" = Suicide-Proof Your Home = The Suicide-Proofing Initiative was launched in September 2011 in partnership with the Rhode Island Department of Health under a youth suicide prevention grant from SAMHSA. This program is based on research conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, which illustrates that preventing youth access to lethal means of suicide, such as firearms, reduces the likelihood that a young person will die from suicide. The Suicide-Proofing Initiative includes TV and radio public service announcements, mass awareness materials, and a website, www.suicideproof.org, all of which are aimed at educating parents of adolescents and teens about simple steps they can take around their homes to reduce the risk of a suicide occurring. Youth-focused Programs CPYV believes that young people have the power to prevent violence. The SPEAK UP campaign and hotline give youth the tools and motivation to help keep their communities safe. = Speak Up = The Speak Up Campaign (and the 1-866-SPEAKUP hotline) was launched in 2002 by PAXGregg Lee Carter, Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law, Volume 1, pp.465-6, ABC-CLIO, 2002, , . (renamed The Center to Prevent Youth Violence in 2011 and merged with the Brady Campaign in 2012) based on the insight that in the vast majority of incidences of youth violence, young people who are not involved in the violence know what is going to happen before it does. Speak Up targets youth with a message encouraging them to ‚Äúspeak up‚Äù about threats of violence they hear about, either by telling an adult who can help or by calling 1-866-SPEAK- UP, an anonymous, national hotline maintained by CPYV. Speak Up programs are currently being implemented in New York City; Minneapolis; Cumberland County, NC; Lindale, TX; Berkeley, CA; and Waldron, AR. = 1-866-SPEAK-UP = 1-866-SPEAK-UP is national hotline for students to anonymously report threats of violence 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The hotline is operated in accordance with a rigid protocol developed in collaboration with national education and law enforcement authorities. Trained counselors collect information from callers and then immediately report the threat to appropriate school and law enforcement officials. The counselors also have access to an extensive database of local, city, and state referral sources, which they can offer callers who call with issues unrelated to youth violence.

Martin Schoock, engraving by Steven van Lamsweerde. Life He was born in Utrecht. His grandfather Anton van Voorst taught him Latin. His parents were Remonstrants and intended him for the law; he studied theology and philosophy from 1632 in Leiden under Antonius Walaeus. As a student of Gisbertus Voetius he acquired a doctorate in philosophy around 1636. About 1638 he became professor in classical literature, rhetoric and history at the University of Deventer, and then in 1640 in the University of Groningen professor in logic and physics. Schoock was combative and brought difficulties on himself. Descartes at one point felt Schoock had libeled him and complained to the French ambassador. Schoock was arrested and spent two days in jail. He exonerated himself by in effect proving that Voetius had put him up to it, citing letters from his former professor. After the death of his first wife, Angelica van Merck, with whom he had seven sons and a daughter, he came into money troubles. He made a second marriage with a rich widow. At the end of his life Schoock left Groningen. He became official historian of the Elector of Brandenburg, and Professor at the University of Frankfurt-on-Oder, where he died. Works Schoock published about 50 works. In the 1642‚Äì43 controversy between Ren√© Descartes and Voetius, Schoock attacked Descartes and his philosophy fiercely in his Admiranda methodus novae philosophiae Renati De Cartes; he stated later that Voetius had been a major author of the book. He published in 1664 two works on dairy products: Tractus de Butyro (on butter), the first such publication; and Accessit ejusdem Diatriba de aversatione casei (on the dislike of cheese).

The Atlantic, 9/28/2011.Asghar Azad. \\"Kainat Soomro gang rape case: All 4 accused men acquitted\\". Daily Times, 5/7/2010. Kainat was steadfast in her determination to obtain justice against her alleged attackers. History In 2007, Soomro claimed that she stopped into a local store to buy a toy for her niece while walking home from school. It was here that she alleged that she was drugged, kidnapped, and subsequently gang-raped by four men, among them a father and son. Soomro claims to have escaped three days after being taken captive. After receiving his daughter back into his home, Soomro's father was allegedly rebuffed by the police, and a local tribunal determined her to be kari, a \\"black female\\", having lost her virginity outside of marriage. Soomro was potentially subject to karo kari, synonymous to honor killing; however, this notion was rejected by her father, brother, and mother. Fearing the subsequent backlash of this ruling after being subject to several attacks, however, Soomro's family fled to Karachi. Defiant of traditional norms, Soomro took her alleged perpetrators to court where the judge ultimately ruled that they were innocent, stating that \\"There is no corroborative evidence available on record. The sole testimony of the alleged rape survivor is not sufficient.\\" Kainat worked with the group WAR, War Against Rape, to try to bring her attackers to justice. During her captivity, Kainat was supposedly married to Ahsan Thebo, one of the alleged rapists, a ceremonial tactic that is apparently often used in Pakistan to avoid the harsh penalty for rape: death. The cleric who performed the marriage claimed that she looked eighteen and that she did not appear to have been forced into the marriage. The judge upheld the marriage according to Islamic law, which still takes precedence over Pakistani law, even though she was thirteen at the time and below the age of consent according to Pakistani law. She did remember signing some unknown documents and that her thumbprints were taken at gunpoint. Pakistani law did not recognize marital rape as legitimate at the time of the trial. None of the alleged rapists brought up the marriage when Kainat was accused of having sex outside of marriage. The judgment of the village elders was that she should be killed. Only when the men were accused and stood trial did they raise that defense. The accused believe she should be silent about her ordeal. Ahsan continued to insist that he will take her from her family. Kainat's brother was killed a month after the court ruling, allegedly for having defended his sister during the ordeal. The Soomro family have been subject to attack, Soomro's brother and father having been beaten by iron rods; Soomro, herself, also received death threats. The family is currently engaged in appeals against the court's ruling. Soomro was the subject of a documentary film entitled Outlawed in Pakistan, depicting her story as an alleged rape victim. The film casts her struggle as a documentary of her and her family's struggle for justice, showcasing the subsequent losses they encounter in defying cultural conventions.

She was the maternal grandmother of Nicolas Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf. Biography Plaque on the wall of the Lutheran church in Gro√ühennersdorf commemorating the place of eternal rest of Henriette von Gersdorff She was born in Sulzbach, Upper Palatinate, the daughter of Karl, Baron von Friesen, and Justina Sophia von Raben. She was educated in Dresden and Leipzig. She was a sister of Otto Heinrich von Friesen, chancellor to Saxon Elector Friedrich August I (August der Starke or Augustus the Strong). Unlike most girls of the time, she was trained in multiple disciplines and even as a youth she was recognized by her contemporaries for her German and Latin verses. She early became a correspondent with many theologians and scientists of the day. At the age of 24 in 1672, she married Nicolas, Baron von Gersdorff (1629‚Äì1702), governor of the Saxon Upper Lusatia. In that capacity she was able to exercise a not unimportant influence in affairs of both church and state. She supported the movement called Pietism and the Saxon Court preacher Philipp Jakob Spener. She encouraged the translation of the Bible into the Lusatian Slavic language of Sorbian but also encouraged the schooling of girls. In this connection she was engaged also in the founding of the Magdalenenstift School for girls in Altenburg. Following her husband's death in 1702, she withdrew to her Grosshennersdorf estate in the mountains of eastern Saxony, where she died. There she devoted herself to the education of her grandson Nicolas Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf. Her home was open to many visitors including Lutheran missionaries to Tranquebar and Greenland. She often offered refuge to religious refugees escaping persecution in neighboring Bohemia and Moravia. The German Pietist poet Johann Jakob Rambach considered her spiritual poetry among the best of their day. Some of her verses are still used in the German Moravian Church.

Legacy Despite its roaring success as a play in New York, London and elsewhere, including repeated revivals and local productions mounted for many years,(18 May 1911). Theatrical: The Still Alarm, Flushing Daily Times (reporting on 1911 revival) the sensationalistic fame of The Still Alarm eventually had to ebb. In 1920, a feature in the New York Tribune about the phasing out of the use of horses for fire fighting still highlighted The Still Alarm as the quintessential firefighting example.Prince, Arnold D. (4 January 1920). The Fire Horse, First Aid to Melodrama, Will Soon Respond to His Last Alarm, New York Tribune, p. 3. But Everson's observation in 1956 that it has \\"no reputation and is little known\\" (though he was only referring to the 1926 film version) fairly characterizes its lack of long-term staying power.

Davis, Sr. (September 19, 1934 - August 9, 2012) Carl Davis website: Biography was an American record producer and music executive, who was particularly active in Chicago in the 1960s and 1970s. He was responsible for hit R&B; records by Gene Chandler, Major Lance, Jackie Wilson, The Chi-Lites, Barbara Acklin, Tyrone Davis and others. Life and career Davis was born in Chicago and attended Englewood High School. He began working as an assistant to disc jockey Al Benson on radio station WGES in 1955, and then joined a record marketing company. In the early 1960s, he helped run the small Nat record label which had a local hit with the song \\"Nite Owl\\" by the DuKays, produced by Davis. A follow-up release, \\"Duke of Earl\\", which Davis also produced, was credited to the group's lead singer Gene Chandler, and became a national no. 1 hit after being leased to the larger Vee-Jay label. Biography by Richie Unterberger at Allmusic.com In 1962, Davis began working as a producer and A&R; director for the Columbia subsidiary label OKeh, where he produced a number of hit records for Major Lance, Billy Butler and Walter Jackson. Many were characterised as \\"peppy, brassy arrangements... and danceable, upbeat songs with a Latin tinge,\\" often using songs written by Curtis Mayfield that Mayfield felt were inappropriate for his own group, The Impressions. He also continued to produce records for Gene Chandler and The Artistics, and produced Mary Wells after she left Motown. In the mid-1960s, he began working for Brunswick Records, where he produced Jackie Wilson's comeback hit, \\"Whispers\\" and the million-seller, \\"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\\", Barbara Acklin's \\"Love Makes a Woman\\", as well as several early hits by The Chi-Lites. He also formed the Dakar label, which had a long run of hits with Tyrone Davis (no relation), including \\"Can I Change My Mind\\" and \\"Turn Back the Hands of Time,\\" and also found success with Hamilton Bohannon. When the Dakar label folded in 1976, Davis formed Chi Sound Records, continuing to find success with Walter Jackson and having a major hit single in 1978 with Gene Chandler's \\"Get Down\\". After a distribution deal with 20th Century Records ended in 1981, Davis used independent distribution for two years before closing Chi Sound down. The company had a brief revival in 1989-90, before re-opening in 2007 and remained active until Davis' death. On February 11, 2013, Carl Davis was honored during the 55th Grammy Awards, along with several other music business personalities in the memorial pictorial tribute.

The band have built a fanbase following support slots with bands such as Murderdolls, Static-X, Godsmack, Deathstars and Motionless in White as well as playing Download and Sonisphere festivals. History =Early Years, 1888 and Grave Times (2005‚Äì2011)= The band formed in 2005, and quickly embarked a number of tours early in their careers including their second, entitled \\"The Black Death Tour\\" climaxing in a sold out London show at the Underworld. These gigs have earned the band a reputation for their energetic and chaotic live shows. With a series of sought-after demos trading between fans, the band released their first EP (1888) in 2009, and released their full album Grave Times for free, in the January issue of Metal Hammer. The Deluxe edition of the album (including a bonus disc), which had more preorders than both Rob Zombie and Foo Fighters and included the 1888 ReWorks EP and 2 music videos, was released on 14 February 2011. The Defiled headlined the J√§germeister stage at Sonisphere in July 2011 and opened the main stage at Bloodstock Open Air in August of the same year.

Bullion in 15 and 20 pound lots was shipped to a refinery in Richmond. Photographs of the nuggets were published in newspapers along the coast. Other miners moved in and staked claims around the area, but the gold was depleted in 1975.

History During the 16th century, the Otanoviƒá family resided in the northern part of Serbia (Subotica) which borders Hungary to the north. It is not known if the Otanoviƒá family resided in this region prior to the 16th century. After the loss of independence to the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, the country of Serbia briefly regained sovereignty under Jovan Nenad in the 16th century. Three Austrian invasions and numerous rebellions left the Otanoviƒá family with less than 300 members of the family from killings and a tough decision to make to flee Serbia to Western territories in Europe. As the Great Serb Migrations depopulated most of Kosovo and Serbia, the Otanoviƒá family sought refuge with other Serbs across the Danube river in Vojvodina to the north and Military Frontier in the West where they were granted rights by the Austrian crown under measures such as the Statuta Wallachorum of 1630. As immigration decreased in the 17th century, the Otanoviƒá family migrated to Western territories in search of independence, new territories, and favorable conditions. Most of the Otanoviƒá family was of Jewish descent and settled in areas of Holland, France and Germany but were then outcast as the German Protestants sect grew in the territories of Germany and Holland. Generally, they settled in rural areas where they subsisted typically as blacksmiths and farmers. In France, the Otanoviƒá families had the reputation of being exiled royalty. Colonies forced the people out of the country and into northern parts of Spain. This led to the change of the surname Otanoviƒá to the Ota√±o surname in the late 17th century. This change occurred between 1678 and 1684. The change was made when the family settled in the northern regions of Spain and Basque country (Spain/France). Today, the Ota√±o surname is a popular one but one that remains tied to the same family tree. Anyone with the last name Ota√±o falls under the same family tree. Ota√±o's are found in the USA and Spanish speaking territories such as northern Spain (Asturias, Irun, San Sebastian,Pamplona, Galicia, Basque country, Canary Islands; Fuerteventura region), Puerto Rico (Lares, Rio Piedras, San German, Isabela, Ponce), Cuba (Havana, Cien Fuegos) and Argentina (Mar del Plata, Rio Gallegos, Santa Cruz). Ota√±o's can also be found in southern regions of France (Bayonne, Biarritz, Hendaye, Landes, Pau, Capbreton, Hossegor, Bordeaux, Anglet). Most of the Ota√±o family reside in regions of southern France and northern Spain and are Roman Catholic and Jewish.

The group claims that it was founded in 1421:George Michael, in his Theology of Hate: A History of the World Church of the Creator, University Press of Florida,2009, , refers to the Odin Brotherhood‚Äôs claim of antiquity, but is skeptical.

Many groups have made claims of being many years old, and it would be really extraordinary if the group had been really founded in 1421.

The Odin Brotherhood. 6th edition, Oxford: Mandrake of Oxford, 2014, p.27 The Odin Brotherhood embraces polytheism. \\"Hard Polytheists,\\" members believe that the gods and goddesses are distinct individual entities and not psychological archetypes or personifications of natural forces.

As hard polytheists, the Odin Brotherhood believes that monotheism, \\"the belief in one totalitarian god, is preposterous and absurd.\\" The Brotherhood insists that \\"no single, superordinary, ineffable entity controls all realities.\\" The brotherhood has no buildings (temples or churches) but attempts to honor the gods everywhere, as long as outsiders are excluded; all words are \\"whispered,\\" and all \\"abominations\\" are avoided. The central rite of the brotherhood is called the \\"Glimpse-Of-Extraordinary-Beauty,\\" during which the celebrants believe they are \\"enveloped and penetrated by the thoughts of a god\\". The brotherhood believes in life after death and that there are three \\"Other-Worlds,\\" one of which is called Valhalla or the White-Kingdom. Not a paradise, Valhalla is a place of honor for heroes. The existence of the Christian hell is denied. Melton has written that, \\"The brotherhood has distanced itself from the racism that has infected Norse beliefs in the twentieth century and eschews the idea that there are either chosen peoples or master races\\".On the Brotherhood's position on race, see Mark Mirabello.

Their dialect is remarkable in that it does not borrow from other Baltic-Finnish languages due to centuries of geographical isolation. Although the number of Tver Karelian people is about 14,633, very few (about 25 in one census) name the dialect as their primary language. Origins There are two complementary theories as to the origin of the Tver Karelians. =Resettlement theory= Tver Karelians may have migrated from their homeland, the Karelian Isthmus, to the Tver region by a process of resettlement. The beginning of migration followed the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617, at the conclusion of the Ingrian war where Russia was defeated by Sweden. Peak migration, in the tens of thousands (25,000 to 30,000), occurred between the 1640s and 1660s. Under Swedish rule, residents of Ingria and Swedish Karelia were forced to convert from the Orthodox religion to Protestantism. This together with famine and disease led to an exodus. =Ethnic sub-group theory= Smaller Karelian groups who were native to the Tikhvin and Valdai regions may have assimilated with the migrant groups. History In 1926, the Tver Karelian numbered about 140,567. 95% identified Karelian as their mother tongue. Between 1937 and 1939, the Karelian National Okrug was recognised with its centre in Likhoslavl. Since 1997, the Tver Karelian have had national and cultural autonomy. =Decrease in national identity= Decreases in Tver Karelian national identity in the twentieth century may be associated with factors such as loss of religion to atheism; loss of native language; and loss of the inter-generational passage of cultural knowledge such as \\"Babkin tradition\\" (traditional craftsmanship). In the 1950s, the Soviet Union experienced a mass migration from rural to urban regions. This affected the Tver Karelians as many of the population were farmers and or resident in rural areas. Because of such predominantly rural residence, the term \\"Karelian\\" might in some circumstances, colloquially equate to \\"Country bumpkin\\". =Changes in the Tver Karelian population over time= ImageSize = width:700 height:300 PlotArea = left:50 right:40 top:20 bottom:20 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify Colors = id:gray1 value:gray(0.9) DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:0 till:140567 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:20000 start:0 gridcolor:gray1 PlotData = bar:1834 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:83304 width:15 text:83,304 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1859 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:95103 width:15 text:95,103 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1873 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:105743 width:15 text:105,743 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1886 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:132332 width:15 text:132,332 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1926 color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:140567 width:15 text:140,567 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1939** color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:119957 width:15 text:119,957 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1959** color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:59120 width:15 text:59,120 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1970** color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:38064 width:15 text:38,064 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1979** color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:30387 width:15 text:30,387 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:1989* color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:29177 width:15 text:29,177 textcolor:red fontsize:8px bar:2002** color:gray1 width:1 from:0 till:14633 width:15 text:14,633 textcolor:red fontsize:8px * In the USSRKomi people / Online-Newspaper / Articles Demoscope Weekly ‚Äî Application.

The garment is also called frumka, a play of the word frum (Yiddish: \\"devout\\") and \\"burqa\\". The group, which was estimated to number several hundred , is concentrated in the town of Beit Shemesh. The issue has proven controversial in Haredi circles, with vocal condemnation of the face-covering veil by many Haredi organizations, including Edah HaChareidis. History The frumka as a mode of dress for Haredi women was encouraged by Bruria Keren, an Israeli religious leader who taught a strict (by Orthodox standards) interpretation of Jewish scripture for female adherents. Keren, who covers herself in several layers of clothing, claims that covering women was originally a Jewish tradition, and that she has seen a 400-year-old picture of Jewish women covered from head to toe. There are also Sephardic women who claim that their mothers covered their bodies entirely so that one cannot discern their figures. A sect member is reported to have explained that she's \\"following these rules of modesty to save men from themselves. A man who sees a woman's body parts is sexually aroused, and this might cause him to commit sin. Even if he doesn't actually sin physically, his impure thoughts are sin in themselves.\\" The religious group, which was estimated to number around 100 in 2008 and may have grown to several hundred by 2011, is concentrated in Beit Shemesh, but also has followers in Safed and Jerusalem. The majority of the women have secular backgrounds. Akiva Novick:'Taliban women': A cover story Ynet, 02.06.11. In February 2008, Bruria Keren was arrested on charges of severely abusing her children. Identified in court as \\"B.\\", she was convicted by the Jerusalem District Court in 2009 on three counts of abuse of a minor or helpless person, and 25 counts of assault in aggravated circumstances, and sentenced to four years in prison. Her husband, identified in court as \\"M.\\", was also convicted of 10 counts of assault, and three counts of abuse of a minor or helpless person, and was sentenced to six months in jail. Other practices Bruria Keren does not speak in front of men, and has taken on various ascetic practices. During her prison term, she was hospitalized several times for malnutrition and other maladies as a result of her unwillingness to eat the food provided. Israel: Taliban Mom Set to be Released on Sunday The Yeshiva World News, June 6, 2012. Some members of the group reportedly do not believe in vaccination or treatments. On February 8, 2013, one woman's baby allegedly died from untreated flu, with the parents then fleeing from the law. On another occasion, a newborn baby had to be taken to a hospital by force, after the mother refused to go to a hospital to give birth to avoid contact with hospitals and physicians. Other cases of child abuse and neglect have been reported within the group. Perception in Israeli society The Israeli press has adopted the informal epithet \\"Taliban mothers\\" to refer to the followers of Bruria Keren's teachings on modesty. According to Miriam Shaviv, the estimated 100 \\"gullible and needy\\" Jewish women, for whom Keren was a holy woman, were not forced, but convinced, by Keren \\"that the ideal for a woman was not to be seen in public (and not even to be heard ‚Äì she used to stop talking for days on end). Negating themselves, she was telling them, making themselves invisible, was the height of frumkeit, while, in fact, it has no basis whatsoever in halachah\\". The Israel National Council for the Child has requested that the Welfare Ministry look into the matter and make sure this behavior is not harmful to the girls. =Religious and legal reaction= The response by other Orthodox schools has been stronger than the rest of the public, and characterized by consternation, particularly against the shal garment. An anonymous pashkevil condemning the \\"cult\\" of \\"epikoros\\" women was posted in Jerusalem in September 2011. The Edah HaChareidis issued an edict declaring the act of wearing the shawl to be a sexual fetish as deviant as scant clothing or nudity. \\"There is a real danger that by exaggerating, you are doing the opposite of what is intended, [resulting in] severe transgressions in sexual matters\\", explains Edah member Rabbi Shlomo Pappenheim. The religious court of Beit Shemesh issued a sharp condemnation of the group, and warned Jewish women and girls not to be drawn after them or follow their customs. People in Beit Shemesh, which includes some of the most religiously radical sects in ultra-Orthodoxy, considered the group of women ridiculously ‚Äì even psychotically ‚Äì zealous. Even Sikrikim came out against the phenomenon of wearing veils, which they consider extreme. The women were regularly ostracized and humiliated by the local Haredi community because of their clothing. \\"We pulled them off buses and yelled at them, 'Desecrators of God's name!'\\", one inhabitant said. The movement has caused severe distress among the women's husbands and relatives, though most husbands endure it. Some men accuse the covered women of being immodest, because they draw more attention to themselves with their unusual dress. One man went to a rabbinical court in an attempt to get a ruling to force his wife to stop wearing the burka. Instead, the court, however, found the woman's behaviour so \\"extreme\\" that it ordered the couple to undergo an immediate religious divorce. In 2014, Israeli police shot a member of the sect after she walked into the Western Wall area without stopping at a security checkpoint. She survived, and was taken to the hospital for treatment. =Literature= Yair Nehorai, an Israeli lawyer who has represented individuals involved in the \\"Taliban Mother\\" case and other ultra-Orthodox extremists, has written a book loosely based on the real-life \\"Taliban Mother\\" case. The book, \\"Taliban Son\\", has been released in Hebrew and in German translation. \\"Now Susanna was exceeding delicate, and beautiful to behold.

He participated in Alan Simon's rock operas Anne de Bretagne, Excalibur: The Celtic Rock Opera and started working with Martin Barre touring and recording with him. Career O'May was born in Rouen, France. As a teenager, he was a fan of rock music and R&B; from the Osmond Brothers, but the album Machine Head by Deep Purple inspired him to become a hard rock guitarist. He joined the heavy metal band Marienthal about 1982. He gave guitar lessons and took himself from Patrick Duplan which made him explore classical music, blues, and bossa nova. Marienthal toured France, England, and Algeria, and opened for acts such as Girlschool, Alvin Lee, and Chariot. After conflicts with their manager, the band split in 1987. O'May continues touring with the group Road 66 across France but playing in bars led to excesses. O'May decides to put an end to this drift during a tour in Belfort He stayed in Belfort where he met the band Ange well as drummer Peter Hartmann and bassist Alain De Bernardi whom he refounded the second group Road 66. They turned in eastern France and Germany. O'May moved to Brittany in 1989. After a third group experience with Road 66 and the sound of Bretons concerts and bals, he released his first solo album, Bob Up, in 1994, with Bretons renowned musicians (Alain Genty, Michel Aumont, Fred Guichen, St√©phane De Vito). Godin, a French guitar distributor, chose him as its spokesperson. In 1995, he was invited by the Festival \\"Cannes Passion Music\\" in Cannes for master classes. This allows him to meet musicians and even play with the rhythm section of Joe Satriani in a closing concert (Stuart Hamm, Rudy Roberts, Jonathan Mover). In 1996, he developed his universe with the album Kids & the War, wherein he joined Celtic instruments (Scottish Snare drum, uilleann pipes). He recorded his third album, Breizh ‚Äì Amerika, where refined his ideas of fusing rock and with traditional sounds, adding Celtic music, and involving French guitarist Norbert Krief. He had the album mixed by Guns N' Roses guitarist Ron Thal in New York City, and released it in 1999. In 2002, O'May produced the album Un Souffle Pour la Vie (Breath for Life) with many artists. He donated the profits to cystic fibrosis research. That year, he also released his fourth album, Anakoustik, and followed with a tour with pianist Philippe Turbin. In 2003, he created a show with the famous Breton singer Gilles Servat for outstanding performance wherein the two artists share their respective directories. At various concerts, he met with many musicians, including Jeff Beck, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Van Wilks, Stuart Hamm. O'May has composed over 100 tracks for the TV serial European coast seen from the sky, which has been distributed to 15 countries. Breton musician Alan Stivell had him play on his album Explore, which released in 2006. O'May also participated in \\"Brittany celebrates St. Patrick's day\\" at Paris-Bercy, and played as a guest musician on Johnny Hallyday's \\"Flashback Tour\\". In 2007, he signed with Milan Music/Universal label for his fifth studio album, Omega. It was released on 8 July, and he played at the \\"Festival des Terre Neuvas\\" in France in front of 47,000 people. In 2008, O'May toured in France and Europe. Alan Simon invited O'May to participate in the rock opera Anne de Bretagne, which involved musicians Barclay James Harvest, Ange, Fairport Convention, Tri Yann, and C√©cile Corbel. O'May also participated in Simon's second project, Excalibur, which is a Celtic rock opera involving musicians such as Alan Parsons, Martin Barre (Jethro Tull), John Helliwell (Supertramp) and Fairport Convention. Excalibur toured in Germany and Switzerland in 2010. O'May released his sixth album, In Live We Trust, with ten original tracks and a horn section. His concert producer describes his style as \\"exploring new territory with an original blend of his own well-known guitar approach and world music elements using among others Celtic, Arabian and Chinese sounds\\". He participated in the 2010 Bercy for St Patrick's Day, and recorded for Excalibur III, which was the third album from the Excalibur rock opera. He continued touring for both of Simon's projects through 2011 and 2012, visiting Switzerland, France, and Germany. He developed a friendship with Martin Barre, and later toured with him in October 2011. In 2012, Martin Barre invited him to join his new group with prestigious line up for several tours in Britain, Germany, Italy, USA. O'May appeared in 2012 as guest on Alan Stivell concerts, in earlier parts of several concerts of Uli Jon Roth (ex-Scorpions guitarist) and played in Nancy Z√©nith including Scorpions, Pat McManus, Gamma Ray, Karelia and Koritni. O'May released his seventh album, Celtic Wings, drawing for writing it in his musical (metal), genetic (Ireland) and emotional (Brittany) roots. It gives rise to a Celtic rock and metal album, between new compositions and covers (Alan Stivell medley, Over the Hills and Far Away, Whiskey in the Jar), with the participation of Martin Barre, Alan Stivell, Jonathan Noyce (Gary Moore, Archive), Moya Brennan (Clannad), James Wood, Christophe Peloil (Tri Yann). The album, which he began writing six months before the release in November, is recorded in Britain, Ireland, England and mastered at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London.

Engs√∏ means 'meadow lake' and Eg√• means 'oak stream', referring to the stream that drains the lake into the Aarhus bay. The lake area is bordered by the Djursland motorway to the north and the Aarhus-Grenaa railway and the municipal heating pipes from Studstrup Power Station to the south and west.  Background  Eg√• Engs√∏ was created by re-flooding meadows on land previously drained in the 1950s for agricultural use. By the 1990s the water quality and natural ecosystem in and around the Eg√• river into which the site drained had declined due to the effect of nitrate fertilizer (eutrophication) use, through intensive farming in the area. Aarhus Municipality, Aarhus County and the Danish Forest and Nature Agency resolved to construct the lake as part of Vandmilj√∏plan II (English: Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment II) from 1998 to reduce this effect through bacterial denitrification . Another major reason for initiating the project, have been the need for a strengthened defence against increasing rainfalls. The lake was created alongside work on the new Djursland motorway, and completed in 2006. Aarhus municipality is single owner. Wetlands reduce flood risks in Aarhus Task Force on Climate Change Adaptation  Surroundings  The wet meadows at the lake brinks are grazed by cattle. The lake covers approximately , with another c. hectares of reedbeds and meadows. Access to the lake is restricted in most places, as the wet meadows at the lake brinks are reserved for grazing cattle. The grazing helps to restrict the growth of shrubs and woody plants and maintain a natural meadow habitat. It also increases the biodiversity. The amount of water in the lake, varies a great deal (by design) with weather and season, but under normal conditions, the average depth is about 1 m. Water levels can rise by an additional meter or more. The lake contains a number of fish species, fishing is prohibited however, as is swimming. On the south brink, there is a bird watching tower erected in 2007, whose construction was funded by Australian wine firm Banrock Station. The lake attracts many different bird species, often in large flocks, with 188 species registered up to 2015. A path c. 5 km long (with each km marked) runs round the circumference of the lake, suitable for walking, rollerblading, running or biking. There are 2 parking lots; near the motorway junction from Lystrupvej at the north east corner and from Viengevej in the south east corner. There are access to and from the villages of Terp and Vejby for bikes and pedestrians, through passageways underneath the railway line on the western side. On the southern brinks are an activity and learning area for children and schools, modelled on a Stone Age settlement, and a number of shelters which may be booked for camping. It is a popular area and it is a statutory goal of the Aarhus municipality to make it publicly accessible and attractive for the citizens.Accessibility to urban-close nature Aarhus municipality  Special flora and fauna  View across the surrounding meadows from the bird watching tower. Many specimens of the flora and fauna at Eg√• Engs√∏, are either rare or relatively rare in Denmark. Some are on the Danish Red List (under IUCN Red List) and/or protected under different habitat directives of the European Union. Here is a few examples: * Common comfrey () is growing here, but is rare in Denmark. It is slightly poisonous and carcinogenic, but have nevertheless been used extensively in folklore-medicine as a wound healing plant among other uses. * The globally endangered (EN) thick shelled river mussel has established here. It is rare in Denmark and is to be protected under the EU habitat directive (II and IV). It is an indicator species of good water quality and important for nature management in general. * Short-eared owls are living and foraging here. It is endangered (EN) and relatively rare in Denmark. * The lake area occasionally houses resting white storks, a critically endangered (CR) and relatively rare bird in Denmark. * Eurasian spoonbills are resting here and they are vulnerable (VU) and relatively rare in Denmark. * The ferruginous ducks living here, are rare in Denmark and near threatened (NT) on a global scale. * Black terns are here and they are endangered (EN) and relatively rare in Denmark. Parts of the meadows surrounding Eg√• Engs√∏, are grazed by cattle in the warmer months of the year, to create ideal conditions for the emerging flora and fauna associated with wet meadows.  Archaeological finds  In the Stone Age, the Eg√• Engs√∏ area was a small part of a much larger fjord, that filled the entire Eg√• valley and stretched from the Bay of Aarhus to Lisbjerg. Moesg√•rd Museum in Aarhus have found numerous traces from the earliest human settlements, boats and kitchen middens in and around the Eg√• valley. In the extensive primeval woods of those days, the Stone Age people hunted for aurochs, elk and wild boars and in the fjord they engaged in fishing, collecting shellfish and whaling even. Orcas was an important part of the meals of the stone age people at the Bay of Aarhus. The whales where killed with throwing spears and lances and the hunt was carried out from their long narrow dugout canoes, according to some sources. Bone remains from at least 16 individuals of the heavy orcas, have been accounted for at the site. Some of the excavated dugouts from the early 1990s to 2001 at 'Lystrup Enge', have been carbon-14 dated to the years 5,210-4,910 BC and is thus the oldest known boats in Northern Europe at present.

Boats had different names depending on hull form, rig, size and role during the Age of Sail, this nomenclature persisting to the present, especially in military circles, long after most distinctions have disappeared. Types Ship's boats that might be carried by a sailing ship include: * Admiral's barge * Captain's gig * Cutter * Dinghy * Jolly boat * Longboat * Pinnace, originally an eight-oared boat (a larger full-rigged pinnace is a different class of vessel) * Yawl, similar to a pinnace, but smaller, usually with four or six oars Age of sail =History= In the age of sail, a ship carried a variety of boats of various sizes and for different purposes. In the navies they were: (1) the launch, or long-boat, the largest of all rowboats on board, which was of full, flat, and high built; (2) the barge, the next in size, which was employed for carrying commanding officers, with ten or twelve oars (3) the pinnace, which was used for transporting subordinate officers, with six or eight oars (4) the yawl, a smaller pinnace; (5) the cutter, which was shorter and broader than the long- boat and used for the transfer of goods (6) the jolly boat, used for light work; (7) the gig, a long narrow boat, employed for expeditious rowing and fitted with sails, and belonging to the captain.Young, Arthur, and James Brisbane.

The Sailing Boat: a Treatise On English And Foreign Boats, Descriptive of the Various Forms of Boats And Sails of Every Nation; With Practical Directions for Sailing, Management. London: Longman, Green, and Roberts, 1863. A merchant ship usually carried on board: (1) the launch or long-boat; (2) the skiff, the next in size and used for towing or kedging; (3) the jolly boat or yawl, the third in size (4) the quarter-boat, which was longer than the jolly-boat and named thus because it was hung on davits at a ship's quarter; (5) the captain‚Äôs gig, which was one of the quarter boats. =Roles= One of the main roles of a ship's boat was to act as a taxi to move stores and people between shore and ship, and between ships.Knox, Dudley, ed. (1940). Naval Documents Related to the Wars With Barbary Powers, Naval Operations from 1802 to 1803. II. U.S. Gov't Printing Office, pp. 294, 300 (recounting when ship's boat, after ferrying Naval Captain to his vessel offshore, on returning capsized in high winds, drowning the midshipman in command and several sailors)(letter Captain Carmick to Lt. Col. Burrows, U.S Marine Corps., 15 Oct 1802). Although some boats were general purpose in nature, boats such as the Captain's gig and the Admiral's barge were for the exclusive use of officers. It was also the role of a military vessel's boats to act as landing craft, to deliver boarders and cutting-out (night attack) parties. Boats were also sometimes armed with a single bow-mounted, forward-firing, smoothbore cannon to function as small gunboats, boats so equipped would support landing operations and act as picket boats for ships at anchor. When a ship was becalmed, mastless, run aground or otherwise unable to move, a ship's boat provided a source of motive power. The ship's anchor and cable would be rowed a distance from the ship before being laid, the crew would then man the ship's capstans to haul the ship forward, known as kedging or warping, this would be repeated as many times as needed. The ship's boats could also when needed be used as a lifeboats and rescue boats. =Storage= During the age of sail the ship's boats of larger ships of the line would be stowed upon the deck, sometimes nested one atop the other. Boats would be deployed and recovered by davits with some vessels carrying a single small boat suspended astern. In the smallest vessels a ship's boat was also on occasion towed astern. Boats stored on deck in tropical climates were usually partially filled with water to prevent the wooden hull planks drying out and shrinking, which would make the boat leak once it was placed in water until the wood swelled up again. When a warship was going into action her boats were usually towed astern. This freed space on the deck, reduced the possibility of the boats being damaged by gunfire and prevented the boats becoming a major source of dangerous splinters if they were left on deck. If a ship was spending a long period at anchor (such as during a spell in a home port when the boats would be regularly employed moving people and supplies between ship and shore) it was common to rig a boat boom perpendicular to the hull of the ship. The boats would then be moored to this, ready for use as required. This saved the manpower and time needed to hoist a boat into and out of the water whenever it was needed. Age of steam A British ship's boat, returning to its mothership (HMS Triumph) after participating in action on April 18, 1915 Steam ships continued to carry ships boats, sometimes armed. For instance, a long-serving 19th century British picket boat, carried on capital ships, was a model introduced in 1867 which saw wide service in World War I and even some limited service in World War II. The typical main armament during most of this boat's service life was a Hotchkiss 3‚Äìpounder, adopted by the Royal Navy in 1886. Present day Ships today from large cruise ships to small private yachts continue to carry ship's boats as tenders and lifeboats. Aboard military vessels ship's boats, often rigid-hulled inflatable, continue to do many of the things expected of their Age of Sail predecessor.

Within the United States, common usage of the term concentrated poverty is observed in the fields of policy and scholarship referencing areas of \\"extreme\\" or \\"high-poverty.\\" These are defined by the US census as areas where \\"40 percent of the tract population [lives] below the federal poverty threshold.\\"Bureau of the Census. 1970. ‚ÄúLow-Income Areas in Large Cities‚Äù. Subject Report. U.S. Department of Commerce: Washington D.C. A large body of literature argues that areas of concentrated poverty place additional burdens on poor families residing within them, burdens beyond what these families' individual circumstances would dictate. Research also indicates that areas of concentrated poverty can have effects beyond the neighborhood in question, affecting surrounding neighborhoods not classified as \\"high-poverty\\" and subsequently limiting their overall economic potential and social cohesion. Concentrated poverty is a global phenomenon, with prominent examples world- wide. Despite differing definitions, contributing factors, and overall effects, global concentrated poverty retains its central theme of spatial density. Multiple programs have attempted to ameliorate concentrated poverty and its effects within the United States, with varying degrees of progress and to sometimes detrimental effect.  History of concentrated poverty in the United States  A long-standing issue, concentrated poverty creates distinct social problems, exacerbating individual impoverishment and standing as the grounds of reform movements and studies since the mid-19th century. An analytical conception and measure for concentrated emerged in the United States around the 1970s, sparked by concern for its inner cities following deindustrialization, late-1960s civil unrest, rapid suburbanization, and subsequent out-migration. Most inner-city areas of concentrated poverty contained predominantly minority populations, featuring expansive public housing developments. The Bureau of the Census developed the first definition of \\"low-income areas\\" as part of its work for the newly-established Office of Economic Opportunity, an organization designed to administer President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty programs, part of his Great Society legislative agenda. Overall, these programs were intended to identify major poverty concentrations within large metropolitan areas. An attribute-based criterion formed the original definition, with census tracks ranked by the following: # Income # Average level of education # Number of single-parent households # Percentage of low-skilled workers # Quality of housing stock Of these, the lowest quartile were designated \\"low income.\\" Following the 1970 census, attribute-based measures were translated to purely statistical ones, defining \\"low-income areas\\" as census tracks with 20%-39% of inhabitants falling under the poverty line, and labeling areas with 40% or more impoverished inhabitants as \\"high\\" or \\"extreme\\" poverty. Calibration of household income statistics most closely approximating the 1960 census lower quartile lead to the adoption of the 20% threshold adopted in 1970. The 40% threshold designating \\"high- poverty\\" areas was set by doubling the low-income threshold, becoming the common definition of \\"concentrated poverty\\" in policy and scholarly research. Paul Jargowsky later developed an alternative measure for concentrated poverty, used more specifically for larger geographical areas. His rate expresses the proportion of all poor individuals in a certain area (e.g., city, metropolitan region, or county) who live in census tracts of high poverty.Jargowsky, Paul A. 1997. Poverty and place: Ghettos, barrios, and the American city. New York: Russell Sage Foundation. Jargowsky further refined the concept of concentrated poverty to more specifically describe the \\"proportion of the poor in some region city or region that resides in high- poverty neighborhoods,\\" as opposed to a simple territorial designation of high-poverty neighborhoods.Jargowsky, Paul A. Stunning Progress, Hidden Problems: The Dramatic Decline of Concentrated Poverty in the 1990s. Living Cities Census Series, Center on Urban and Metropolitan Studies. Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, May 2003. William Julius Wilson's book The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy was the first major scholarly work utilizing the census measure to study changing spatial trends in poverty, as well as its causes and effects.Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago. According to his findings, tracts of concentrated poverty increased dramatically throughout metropolitan areas of the United States during the 1970s, alongside the population of poor people residing within them. These trends related specifically to an African American \\"underclass\\" in America's inner cities (see trends below). In this work, Wilson utilizes concentrated poverty as an analytic measure to gauge the changing spatial organization and intensification of poverty, as a territorial category to designate an object of analysis, and also as a causal factor in and of itself, effecting life chances among the poor. All three conceptualizations have since served as the basis for a wide range of social science research, as well as policy interventions and prescriptions. = Analytic measure = Wilson's study both set the precedent of using the census' 40% threshold and has been adopted as the standard measure for the study of poverty trends and poor neighborhoods. Its standardization is largely credited to the measure's convenience, as opposed to any conceptual justifications, and is employed to compare degrees of poverty concentration between areas, as well as the growth or decline in total number of tracts fitting such qualifications within a given city, region, or country. Both the federal definition of poverty and the census definition of concentrated poverty (40% threshold) have received criticism. The overall discussion for both cases has labeled the use of bureaucratic categories intended to facilitate both the routine collection of statistics and public assistance eligibility as unfit for comprehensively capturing urban social structures and strategies. Many criticisms revolve around the poverty threshold, the most prominent including the inability to fully consider the needs of different family types (e.g.: childcare services, health insurance, etc.), the non-cash benefits from public sources, the cash and non-cash resources (or lack thereof) from social and familial networks, and the consideration of regional variations in cost of living expenses.Madden, J. 1996. ‚ÄúChanges in the Distribution of Poverty Across and Within the U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1979-1989‚Äù. Urban Studies 33,9:1581-1600. Concurrently, the 40% benchmark used by the census and various scholars to define concentrated poverty does not refer to any adequately specific objective or subjective criteria. Jargowsky and Bane (1991) assert ‚Äú...that the 40 percent criterion came very close to identifying areas that looked like ghettos in terms of their housing conditions‚Äù (p. 239). They contend that ‚Äúthe areas selected by the 40 percent criterion corresponded closely with the neighborhoods that city officials and local Census Bureau officials considered ghettos‚Äù (p. 239). Thus, these scholars argued that although ‚Äúany fixed cutoff is inherently arbitrary...the 40 percent criterion appropriately identifies most ghetto neighborhoods‚Äù (p. 239). Here we observe the threshold's justification on the basis of general personal impressions and impressions of city officials rather than any rigorous objective criteria.Jargowsky, P. and Bane, M. 1991. ‚ÄúGhetto Poverty in the United States, 1970 to 1980‚Äù. in The Urban Underclass edited by Christopher Jencks and Paul E. Peterson. Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution. In addition to contentious debate regarding the selection of particular percentage thresholds as accurate descriptive measures (i.e. 30% vs. 60% threshold of residents in poverty), other scholars criticized the use of an absolute indicator of poverty concentration as an analytic measure and tool for trend tracking. In one instance, researchers Massey and Eggers contend that a relative, segregation-based indicator is more rigorous and meaningful, claiming that \\". . .levels and trends in poverty concentration are best studied with well-established measures of segregation that use complete information on the spatial distribution of income instead of an ad hoc and arbitrary definition of 'poverty neighborhoods' and 'poverty concentration'\\"Bol, Manute. and Eggers, M. 1990. ‚ÄúThe Ecology of Inequality: Minorities and the Concentration of Poverty, 1970-1980‚Äù. American Journal of Sociology 95(5): 1156. cited in Wolch, Jennifer and Nathan Sessoms.\\"The Changing Face of Concentrated Poverty.\\" Based on a recent growth of working poor populations and emergence of inner-suburban poverty, Jennifer Wolch and Nathan Sessoms have challenged the utility of the traditional 40% threshold concept of concentrated poverty.Wolch, Jennifer and Nathan Sessoms.\\"The Changing Face of Concentrated Poverty.\\" http://www.usc.edu/schools/sppd/lusk/research/pdf/wp_2005-1004.pdf Their study shows that several areas in Southern California, which meet the 40% threshold, do not demonstrate the characteristics traditionally associated with areas of concentrated poverty, and do not suffer from extreme levels of dysfunction, crime, and blight. Additionally, they are often reasonably clean, safe, well-maintained, and home to several commercial/retail establishments, public facilities, etc. They also argue that the term has become conflated with \\"areas of social problems\\" and argue that the concept should be unhooked from behavioral definitions and stigma. = Territorial category = Areas of concentrated poverty as a territorial category have become both key targets of place-specific policy interventions and the object of analysis for comparative studies within policy research and the social sciences. Its use as a territorial category has also resulted in several critiques, beginning with the question of whether census tracts are good spatial categories for social- scientific analysis. Systematic field observations in various inner-city areas reveal that census tracts serve as poor proxies of what residents construe and construct as neighborhoods in their daily routines.Sanchez-Jankowski, M. 2008. Cracks in the Pavement: Social Change and Resilience in Poor Neighborhoods. Berkeley: University of California Press. Sociologist Loic Wacquant criticized the measure when used to denote or define ‚Äúghettos,\\" a reference first made by Bane and Jargowsky and William Julius Wilson (see above). Scholars increasingly conflate areas of concentrated poverty and ghettos, something Wacquant claims camouflages the constitutive role of ethnoracial domination in the ghetto and hyperghetto. According to Wacquant, this income-based notion of the ghetto is \\"ostensibly deracialized\\" and largely a product of policy-geared research fearful of the \\"strict taboo that weighs on segregation in the political sphere\\".Wacquant, L. 2011. ‚ÄúA Janus-Faced Institution of Ethnoracial Closure: A Sociological Specification of the Ghetto.‚Äù Pp. 1-31 in Ray Hutchison and Bruce Haynes (eds.), The Ghetto: Contemporary Global Issues and Controversies, Boulder, Westview, 201. Massey and Denton similarly question the use of a purely income-based measure to define areas of deprivation, showing strong empirical evidence and theorizing that high levels of racial segregation (defined by an index of dissimilarity above 60) produce distinct socio-economic constellations and processes.Massey, D., and Nancy Denton. 1993. American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. Additional questions by Wacquant include why rural communities and suburban tracts are often left out of social science analyses focusing on concentrated poverty. = Causal factor = Concentrated poverty is increasingly recognized as a \\"causal factor\\" in compounding the effects of poverty by isolating residents from networks and resources useful for realizing human potential (explored further in the effects section). William Julius Wilson coined these processes in The Truly Disadvantaged as \\"concentration effects.\\" He termed the primary effect \\"social isolation\\", defined as the lack of contact or sustained interaction with individuals and institutions representing mainstream society. This isolation makes it much more difficult for those looking for jobs to be tied into the job network, also generating behavior not conducive to good work histories. A key in Wilson's idea of social isolation is the linking of behavioral outcomes of the ghetto poor to the structural constraints of the job market and historical discrimination. This contradicts the theory of a \\"culture of poverty,\\" which stipulated that basic values and attitudes of the ghetto subculture have been internalized, placing a strong emphasis on the autonomous character of these cultural traits once they come into existence.Lewis, O. 1959. Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty. New York: Basic Books. Many scholars have called to question this causal framing. For Wilson, concentrated poverty stood as a link between structural factors and social behaviors produced through the \\"concentration effects\\" of poverty. Subsequent policy and scholarly research have ignored such causes. According to Agnew, \\"one can start out using spatial concepts as shorthand for complex sociological processes but slip easily into substituting the spatial concepts for the more complex argument\\".Agnew J, 1993, \\"Representing space, scale and culture in social science\\", in Place/Culture/ Representation Eds J Duncan, D Ley (Routledge, New York) pp 251-271 Steinberg has claimed that this amounts to misdiagnosing the symptom as the disease, as the structural factors are severed from the spatial outcome, policy prescriptions to address concentrated poverty have shifted from economic policies to encourage full-employment to simply deconcentrating poverty (see section below).Steinberg, S. (2010). The Myth of Concentrated Poverty. In The Integration Debate: Competing Futures for American Cities. Chester Hartman and Gregory Squires, eds. Pp.228‚Äì301. New York: Routledge. As Goetz observed, ‚ÄúOver time, focus has shifted away from the causes of concentrated poverty toward the behavior of the poor in response to concentrated poverty,\\" which ultimately has led to reproducing the \\"culture of poverty\\" thesis in severing the theory from its structural roots.Goetz, E. (2003). Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America. Washington, DC: The Urban Institute Press Causes The shifting spatial distribution of poverty is attributed to various structural factors, primarily of an economic nature. According to William Julius Wilson in the 1987 book The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy, the driving forces of American concentrated poverty date back to the 1970s.Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago. The following are some causes outlined in Wilson's book: *Racial discrimination and segregation: In the early twentieth century, black people were discriminated against far more severely than white immigrants. Restrictive covenants, municipal policies, and federal housing programs forced black people, unlike other immigrant groups, into particular areas within inner cities. Concurrently, discrimination against black people was far more severe than against other groups in the labor market, leading to disproportionate poverty and concentration in low- paying jobs, particularly in industrial sectors. Collectively, these forms of racial and spatial discrimination laid the initial foundation for many areas of contemporary concentrated poverty. *Deindustrialization: Black people's discrimination-driven concentration in low-wage sectors led to greater adverse effects and overall increased vulnerability during economic shifts in advanced industrial society. Their heavy concentration in the automobile, rubber, steel, and other smokestack industries meant that they were especially impacted by deindustrialization occurring in American cities from the 70s onward. Such disparities reveal the overall vulnerability of minorities to economic changes such as recessions, structural shifts, cutbacks, and other events driving job shifts, due to their disproportionate concentration in low- wage, often manual/industrial sectors. *Increasing gaps between skilled and unskilled workers: Many new jobs in the post-1970s economy have disproportionately emerged in the service and knowledge sectors. Large wage inequalities characterize these sectors, which have lowered average household income compared to those holding better paying industrial jobs in the past (see Working Poor) *Spatial mismatch: Suburban expansion shifted economic growth from the inner cities to suburbs. Spatial distance from places of employment, among other locations, prevented inner-city poor families from taking advantage of these new opportunities. *White flight: Large scale migrations of wealthier white people from the inner-city were driven by increased fears and anxieties directed against minority populations. Construction of the federal highway system and expansions of federal mortgage programs facilitated these patterns. In turn, the proportion of both poor and black people in urban populations increased concurrently with the erosion of municipal tax bases, leading toward a downward spiral in the provision of public services, job opportunities, and economic development. *Flight of the black middle class: Black inner-city middle class families, taking advantage of increased opportunities for socioeconomic mobility following the end of several institutional racial restrictions after the civil rights movement, such as within federal housing loans and programs, moved to mixed neighborhoods or satellite suburbs. This increased the proportion of poor people within the ghetto, weakening civic institutions and investment in the local economy. *Changes in age demographics: A simultaneous increase in the proportion of inner-city black youth accompanied increases in concentrated poverty. Populations of central-city black people aged 14 to 24 rose by 78% from 1960‚Äì1970, compared with an increase of 23% for whites of the same age. This demographic imbalance is often considered a contributing factor to increases in crime, teenage pregnancy, unemployment, and other factors associated with poverty. *Changes in family structure: In 1965, 25% of all black families were headed by women. The proportion surpassed 28% in 1970 and reached 40% by 1979. Trends continued, with 43% in 1984 and 72% by 2010. Because poverty is measured at the household level, rather than the individual level, these demographic changes inevitably resulted in an \\"on-paper\\" increase in poverty rates. Furthermore, this data implies an increase in single-mother households, a demographic which several studies show faces disproportionate poverty. Effects Several studies have pointed to the role of \\"neighborhood effects\\" caused by concentrated poverty. These studies indicate that neighborhood characteristics, particularly the concentration of poverty, affect crime and delinquency, education deficiencies, psychological distress, and various health problems, among many other issues. Thresholds, or tipping points, also prove important. In a recent review of research, George C. Galster notes that studies suggest ‚Äúthat the independent impacts of neighborhood poverty rates in encouraging negative outcomes for individuals like crime, school leaving, and duration of poverty spells appear to be nil unless the neighborhood exceeds about 20 percent poverty, whereupon the externality effects grow rapidly until the neighborhood reaches approximately 40 percent poverty; subsequent increases in the poverty population appear to have no marginal effect.‚ÄùGeorge C. Galster, ‚ÄúThe Mechanism(s) of Neighborhood Effects: Theory, Evidence, and Policy Implications.‚Äù Presentation at the ESRC Seminar, St. Andrews University, Scotland, UK, 4‚Äì5 February 2010.Housing values and rents show similar patterns. Using data from the 100 largest U.S. metro areas from 1990 to 2000, Galster et al. find little relationship between neighborhood poverty rates and declines in neighborhood housing values and rents until poverty exceeds 10 percent, at which point values decline rapidly before becoming shallower at very high poverty levels.‚ÄúThe Costs of Concentrated Poverty: Neighborhood Property Markets and the Dynamics of Decline.‚Äù In Nicolas P.

The Pew Economic Mobility Project conducted one of the largest studies examining concentrated poverty's effects, tracking 5,000 families since 1968. The study found that no other factor, including parents' education, employment, or marital status, was as important as neighborhood poverty in explaining why African-American children were disproportionately more likely to have lower incomes than their parents as adults.Sharkey, Patrick (2009, July) ‚ÄúNeighborhoods and the Black-White Mobility Gap,‚Äù Washington, DC: The Economic Mobility Project, The Pew Charitable Trusts. Thus, the concentrated poverty rate aims to capture the extent of a possible ‚Äúdouble burden‚Äù imposed on poor families living in extremely poor communities; both being poor and living in a poor community. The study also found negative effects on the better-off children raised in such areas. While initial research failed to isolate the direct effects of \\"concentrated poverty\\" itself, more recent work has shifted to identifying its primary mechanisms. This scholarship us primarily focused on examining the social-interactive and institutional aspects produced through concentrated poverty, rather than a sole focus on the socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods. Below is an overview of these effects and mechanisms.Robert J. Sampson, Jeffrey D. Morenoff, and Thomas Gannon-Rowley. 2002. ‚ÄúAssessing ‚ÄòNeighborhood Effects‚Äô: Social Processes and New Directions in Research,‚Äù Annual Review of Sociology 28: 466.George C. Galster, ‚ÄúThe Mechanism(s) of Neighborhood Effects: Theory, Evidence, and Policy Implications.‚Äù Presentation at the ESRC Seminar, St. Andrews University, Scotland, UK, 4‚Äì5 February 2010. =Mechanisms= (From George C. Galster, \\"The Mechanism(s) of Neighborhood Effects: Theory, Evidence, and Policy Implications\\"). Social interactive effects This set of mechanisms refers to social processes endogenous to neighborhoods. These processes include: * Social contagion: Behaviors, aspirations, and attitudes may be changed by contact with peers who are neighbors. Under certain conditions these changes can take on contagion dynamics that are akin to ‚Äúepidemics.‚Äù * Collective socialization: Individuals may be encouraged to conform to local social norms conveyed by neighborhood role models and other social pressures. This socialization effect is characterized by a minimum threshold or critical mass being achieved before a norm can produce noticeable consequences for others in the neighborhood. * Social networks: Individuals may be influenced by the interpersonal communication of information and resources of various kinds transmitted through neighbors. These networks can involve either ‚Äústrong ties‚Äù and/or ‚Äúweak ties.‚Äù * Social cohesion and control: The degree of neighborhood social disorder and its converse, ‚Äúcollective efficacy\\" may influence a variety of behaviors and psychological reactions of residents. * Relative deprivation: This mechanism suggests that residents who have achieved some socioeconomic success will be a source of disamenities for their less-well off neighbors. The latter, it is argued, will view the successful with envy and/or will make them perceive their own relative inferiority as a source of dissatisfaction. * Parental mediation: The neighborhood may affect (through any of the mechanisms listed under all categories here) parents‚Äô physical and mental health, stress, coping skills, sense of efficacy, behaviors, and material resources. All of these, in turn, may affect the home environment in which children are raised. Environmental effects Environmental mechanisms refer to natural and human-made attributes of the local space that may affect directly the mental and/or physical health of residents without affecting their behaviors. As in the case of social-interactive mechanism, the environmental category can also assume distinct forms: * Exposure to violence: If people sense that their property or person is in danger they may suffer psychological and physical responses that may impair their functioning or sensed well-being. These consequences are likely to be even more pronounced if the person has been victimized. * Physical surroundings: Decayed physical conditions of the built environment (e.g., deteriorated structures and public infrastructure, litter, graffiti) may impart psychological effects on residents, Geographical effects Geographic mechanisms refer to aspects of spaces that may affect residents‚Äô life courses yet do not arise within the neighborhood but rather purely because of the neighborhood‚Äôs location relative to larger-scale political and economic forces such as: * Spatial mismatch: Certain neighborhoods may have little accessibility (in either spatial proximity or as mediated by transportation networks) to job opportunities appropriate to the skills of their residents, thereby restricting their employment opportunities. * Public services: Some neighborhoods may be located within local political jurisdictions that offer inferior public services and facilities because of their limited tax base resources, incompetence, corruption, or other operational challenges. These, in turn, may adversely affect the personal development and educational opportunities of residents. Institutional effects The last category of mechanisms involves actions by those typically not residing in the given neighborhood who control important institutional resources located there and/or points of interface between neighborhood residents and vital markets: * Stigmatization: Neighborhoods may be stigmatized on the basis of public stereotypes held by powerful institutional or private actors about its current residents. In other cases this may occur regardless of the neighborhood‚Äôs current population because of its history, environmental or topographical disamenities, style, scale and type of dwellings, or condition of their commercial districts and public spaces. Such stigma may reduce the opportunities and perceptions of residents of stigmatized areas in a variety of ways, such as job opportunities and self- esteem. * Local institutional resources: Some neighborhoods may have access to few and/or high-quality private, non-profit, or public institutions and organizations, such as benevolent charities, day care facilities, schools, and medical clinics. The lack of same may adversely affect the personal development opportunities of residents. * Local market actors: There may be substantial spatial variations in the prevalence of certain private market actors that may encourage or discourage certain behaviors by neighborhood residents, such as liquor stores, fresh food markets, fast food restaurants, and illegal drug markets. Regional examples Concentrated poverty is a global phenomenon, with examples visible in both developed and developing countries. According to the Brookings Institution, post-industrial revolution growth has spread unevenly between and within countries, with many developing countries likely to still have regional examples of extreme poverty. Through spatial analysis of satellite imagine, the Brookings Institution defined various \\"hotspots\\" of extreme poverty, primarily in areas of tropical Africa, tropical Latin America, Central-South Asia, and Southeast Asia/Western Oceania. Although this analysis does not refer specifically to concentrated poverty, rather more broadly to extreme poverty, its conclusions underscore the widespread nature of concentrated poverty, as well as its relationship to extreme poverty and poverty cycles. Despite positive trends in the reduction of global poverty rates, researchers such as Oxford's Max Roser and Esteban Ortiz-Ospina highlight the deepening divide between socioeconomic classes worldwide, which in turn paints an inaccurate image of the conditions faced by most populations. Instead, regions such as Africa and Asia observe overall economic growth while its poorest populations stagnate. The widespread nature of extreme poverty, as well as trends pointing towards the growth of concentrated poverty, suggest a need to explore this issue through a more global lens. The following are examples of concentrated poverty through the lens of various countries/regions, ranging from developed to developing. While it is not an exhaustive list of examples, the overall goal is to provide information regarding the diverse characteristics of concentrated poverty. = American trends = 1970 - 1990 The number of people living in high- poverty neighborhoods - where the poverty rate was 40% or higher - doubled between 1970 and 1990. It was not until after the release of the 1980 census, however, that trends of poverty concentration were systematically studied, as the 1970 census was the first instance where the 40% measure was employed. Studying these trends, sociologist William Julius Wilson made the following discoveries regarding the decade of the 1970s: # Poverty increased dramatically throughout metropolitan areas of the United States. # The number of poor people residing within poor metropolitan areas increased # The exacerbation of poverty conditions primarily occurred within African-American neighborhoods.Robert F. Wagner public housing in East Harlem, New York City. Several other scholars later affirmed a dramatic increase in the number of neighborhoods classified as areas of concentrated poverty in the 1970s.Jargowsky, Paul A. 1997. Poverty and place: Ghettos, barrios, and the American city. New York: Russell Sage Foundation. The increase of neighborhoods classified as areas of \\"extreme poverty\\" continued into the 1980s, albeit to a lesser extent.Mincy, Ronald B., and Susan J. Wiener. 1993. The underclass in the 1980s: Changing concepts, constant reality. Washington, DC: The Urban Institute. The same trends of concentrated poverty observed at the census tract and neighborhood levels were similarly observed at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level. Both decades between 1970-1990 saw a increased difference in poverty rates between central cities and their suburbs, reflecting an increasing spatial concentration of MSA poverty within central cities.Madden, J. 1996. ‚ÄúChanges in the Distribution of Poverty Across and Within the U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1979-1989‚Äù. Urban Studies 33,9:1581-1600. The changing spatial distribution of poverty has been attributed to the following: * Changes in the labor market due to deindustrialization, leading to a widening wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers and spatial mismatches between the types of jobs offered in cities and the type of workers residing within them. * Declining economic growth (several studies, however, demonstrate a weak or non-existent link between poverty reduction and urban economic growth in neighborhoods with extreme poverty). * Relocation of upper- and middle- income residents from cities to suburbs, alongside demographic changes such as the rise in one- parent households and a decrease in labor market participation. Such changes were intertwined with America's history of ethno-racial segregation. Some of its effects include white flight from American cities, leading to a declining tax base to provide city services, and the civil rights movement, allowing better-off blacks to leave inner-city areas. While concentrated poverty between 1970-1990 increased among blacks, Hispanics, and whites, the most dramatic increases were observed among blacks, followed by Hispanics, and to a much lesser extent whites.Wilson, W. 1987: The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago. 1990 - 2000 In the 1990s, the number of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods declined by 24%, or 2.5 million people. The steepest declines in high-poverty neighborhoods occurred in metropolitan areas in the Midwest and South, and the overall share of poor people living in high-poverty neighborhoods declined among all racial groups. The decline of the number of high-poverty neighborhoods occurred in rural areas and central cities, while suburbs experienced minimal change.Jargowsky, Paul A. Stunning Progress, Hidden Problems: The Dramatic Decline of Concentrated Poverty in the 1990s. Living Cities Census Series, Center on Urban and Metropolitan Studies. Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, May 2003. Scholars have also recognized qualitative shifts in areas of \\"concentrated poverty.\\" A study of Southern California's (a state which observed increases in concentrated poverty during the 1990s despite national downward trends) metropolitan areas by Wolch and Sessoms draws attention to the contrast between growing inner- suburban poverty and the original intention of the concentrated poverty statistic. These areas, which qualify as \\"extreme poverty\\" under the 40% threshold, do not demonstrate the negative social behaviors or physical decay of traditional images that the original statistic was designed to designate. Other scholars argued for an expansion of the definition, challenging Jargowsky's claim of decreasing poverty concentration in the 1990s. Using the relative definition of poverty employed in Europe, based on 50% of the median income in each region, Swanstrom et al. point to an increase in concentrated poverty throughout most American cities during the 1990s.Swanstrom, Todd; Rob Ryan; & Katherine M. Stigers. (2007). Measuring Concentrated Poverty: Did It Really Decline in the 1990s?. UC Berkeley: Institute of Urban and Regional Development. Retrieved from: http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2qm2s1vq. 2000 - present Example of public housing in South Minneapolis, Minnesota. From 2000 to 2009, the populations of extremely poor neighborhoods climbed by over one third, from 6.6 million to 8.7 million, erasing any progress claimed during the 1990s.Kneebone, E. et al. (2011) ‚ÄúThe Re-Emergence of Concentrated Poverty: Metropolitan Trends in the 2000s.\\" Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 116‚Äì9.http://www.brookings.edu/topics/concentrated- poverty.aspx During that time, the share of poor people living in such neighborhoods grew from 9.1% to 10.5%, highlighting the \\"double burden\\" effect of their individual poverty and the poverty within their community.Kneebone, E. et al. (2011) ‚ÄúThe Re-Emergence of Concentrated Poverty: Metropolitan Trends in the 2000s.\\" Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 116‚Äì9.http://www.brookings.edu/topics/concentrated-poverty.aspx A Brookings Institution report attributes this trend to both the downturn of 2000 and the 2008 recession. This poverty not only affected inner cities, but continued to spread into the suburbs, extending the suburbanization trend of concentrated poverty first noted in the 1990s. Furthermore, the study indicated that the concentrated poverty rates of 2010 was approaching an all-time high. In metro areas, concentrated poverty grew to 15.1%, a considerable increase from 11.7% between 2005-2009 and nearing the previous record of 16.5% from 1990. Such trend appears to confirm William Julius Wilson's original thesis, which states that extremely poor neighborhoods and their residents are the last to benefit from economic growth and the first to suffer from economic troubles. = Concentrated poverty in Brazil = Favela neighborhood on the periphery of an urban area. Despite its ranking as one of the largest economies in the world, Brazil continues facing deep socioeconomic inequality. According to a 2008 paper by Nathalie Beghin for Oxfam International employing data from the Institute for Applied Economic Research, 11.5% of its population was categorized as extremely poor, with an overall 30.3% (including the aforementioned 11.5%) classified as \\"poor.\\"Beghin, Nathalie. ‚ÄúNotes on Inequality and Poverty in Brazil: Current Situation and Challenges .‚Äù Oxfam International, 2008, doi:https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/112516/fp2p-bp- notes-inequality-poverty-brazil-current-140608-en.pdf. Beghin further states that Brazil's poverty rate is in some cases more than three times higher than that of comparable economies. Such economic situation in turn confines poor people to areas with large spatial concentrations of poverty, such as the infamous Favelas, neighborhoods with few access to government services, high crime, and poor living conditions. According to a descriptive study by Brueckner et al. for the Journal of Housing Economics, significant rural to urban migration in the second half of the 1900s led to unprecedented metropolitan population growth. Given the rapid influx of often-poor migrants, as well as insufficient housing, slums developed along the edges of cities. These neighborhoods did not follow building codes, lacking sanitation and other services. Exhibiting similarities to examples of concentrated poverty in the United States, neighborhoods such as favelas have additionally struggled with racial and socioeconomic discrimination. Working on Brazilian census data, the Brueckner et al. study underscores the racial disparity of favela residents, finding a statistically significantly greater chance of non-white residents existing within favelas than the rest of Brazilian urban areas. Given their relative disconnect from government oversight, favelas are frequently depicted as breeding grounds for organized crime. A study for the Political and Legal Anthropology Review outlines criminal organizations' strategies for finding refuge within favelas, involving complex relationships with favela residents. These organizations essentially act as a government for favelas, claiming to provide order, security, and resources. Within this study, however, such security is referred to as \\"ordered disorder,\\" due to the continued threat of violence to residents brought forth by criminal activity. = Concentrated poverty in Turkey = Gecekondu neighborhood in Ankara, Turkey Similar to Brazil, Turkey experienced an explosive rate of urbanization throughout the 20th century, leading to various hasty attempts at expanding urban housing capacities. Citing a variety of Turkish government sources, the Middle East Institute describes Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, as increasing its share of the total Turkish population from 5% in 1955 to at least 14% in 2000, with continued growth patterns. Gecekondu refers to neighborhoods built through legally-questionable methods to house rural migrants within or outside urban centers. The primary demographic of gecekondu residents are rural poor seeking improved living conditions and urban employment. Research published in Turkey's Megaron journal by Bekta≈ü & Y√ºcel outline vast problems faced by the residents of gecekondus, relating primarily to their integration to urban life, as well as spatial distribution. In essence, their study reveals the impact of continued rapid migration patterns and insufficient governmental responses on urban inequality. As more residents settle into urban centers, the concentration of poverty increases while resources become increasingly scarce. Gecekondu residents face additional hardships due to the questionable legality of their housing: as gecekondus are traditionally built through legal loopholes, avoiding costs associated with formal land use, residents may encounter a problematic relationship with government entities. In a paper for the journal Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development, researcher Tahire Erman explores the relationship between gecekondu residents and government intervention, revealing the residents' decreasing bargaining power. Primarily, the demographic makeup of gecekondus have led to varying levels of government attention to different neighborhoods. As the years progressed and Turkish politics shifted toward neoliberalism, neighborhoods grew increasingly divided, with the largest ramifications being a loss of collective bargaining power. Consequently, residents are more vulnerable to displacement and face increasing governmental neglect. Overall, gecekondu neighborhoods stand as examples of the negative effects inherent to and generated by concentrated poverty, with residents facing poor living conditions and socioeconomic and political barriers to integration.  Examples of policy interventions  = United States = Begging in the early 1990s, federal housing policy has focused on reducing the spatial concentration of poverty, accomplished through three methods: # Creating income diversity within public housing developments that continue to be owned and operated by public housing authorities under the rules of the public housing program. # Creating income diversity in new or redeveloped housing projects, including former public housing projects redeveloped under the HOPE VI program. # Encouraging the use of tenant-based housing vouchers for families to locate in neighborhoods that will improve the life opportunities of family members.  Mobility programs  Authorized in 1992, the Moving To Opportunity (MTO) pilot program provided section 8 vouchers to public housing residents to enable them to move out of public housing and into neighborhoods with lower poverty. Modeled after Chicago's Gautreaux program, which provided housing vouchers to black public housing residents so they could move to more integrated neighborhoods, MTO stands as an example of \\"mobility programs\\" aimed at enabling poor families from high- poverty neighborhoods to move into communities featuring decreased poverty levels, such as middle-class neighborhoods. Comparatively, the Gatreuax program exhibited stronger and clearer results than MTO. The program assigned participants selected from the same pool of callers to random private apartment placements in either suburban or urban locations. Follow-ups several years later revealed different outcomes between suburban and urban participants. Namely, urban participants were more likely to have remained on welfare rolls while their suburban counterparts were very likely to find employment and leave welfare programs. Additionally, children of urban participants were likely to drop out of high school while suburban participants were likely to graduate from high school and proceed towards college. The children of both types of participants began below the average academic level of their peers, however due to the lower number of participants selected for suburbs, suburban participants' children experience greater individual instruction. In turn, suburban children eventually reached the same level of academic proficiency as their average classmates. On the other hand, participants of the MTO program experienced non-significant changes in employment and educational improvement, with nearly half of all participants moving back or remaining in their original neighborhood. Most participants did not move into suburbs, instead moving more frequently into other nearby urban neighborhoods with lower poverty levels. The program did show significant improvements regarding the fostering of a sense of security among participants, resulting in the reduction of stress, fear, and depression, particularly among women and young girls.Briggs, Xavier de Souza, Susan J. Popkin, and John Goering. 2010. Moving to Opportunity: The Story of an American Experiment to Fight Ghetto Poverty. Oxford University Press, USA, March 31 Several scholars have questioned both the success and broader ability of such policy interventions as an adequate response to concentrated poverty. Goetz argues that voluntary programs like MTO and Gautreaux, though justifiable on other grounds, will not make a dent in concentrated poverty for two reasons: # They primarily select families most likely to succeed in their new environments, essentially the \\"cream of the crop.\\" # They do not reach sufficient scales to noticeably affect overall settlement patterns. MTO, Gautreaux and other voluntary mobility programs can apply to only a subset of the poor by the political reality of destination communities. Low-poverty areas are not anxious to receive large numbers of poor, public housing families, and there will typically be political backlash if current residents feel that these families are being forced into their neighborhoods, and it was this type of resistance that ended the expansion of the program in 1995. Venkatesh and Celimi point out, dispersal programs incorrectly assume the poor can relocate as easily as the middle class does. In fact, very real resource constraints limit the ability of public housing families to abandon existing support networks, and these constraints limit the attractiveness of dispersal strategies to poor families. Lastly, mobility programs have historically contributed to disadvantages for the current residents of neighborhoods where poor families have been relocated.  Hope VI  Hope VI is a federal housing plan designed to revitalize American public housing projects into mixed-income developments. In most cases, such projects involve demolishing older high rise buildings composed entirely of extremely low-income residents and constructing higher quality, low-density, housing with various tiers of income earners. While Hope VI has successfully de-concentrated public housing sites, it has done little to de-concentrate poverty within poor neighborhoods in general.Goetz, Edward G. 2003. Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America. Urban Inst Pr, May. Public housing families who are displaced and relocated typically re-concentrate in other poor neighborhoods nearby. Very rarely do these families relocate to low-poverty suburbs. Over half of families relocated by HOPE VI either move into other public housing or use vouchers to rent units on the private market. Public housing units are more likely to be in low-income neighborhoods. Families using vouchers are also likely to move into low-income areas, as they are more likely to find program-eligible units and landlords willing to rent to them. Therefore, while HOPE VI has significantly improved the physical quality of several public housing sites and the lives of former residents given units in the new developments, it has come short of addressing the issue of concentrated poverty at large.

Eventually Roberts fulfilled two missions for the church, one in California and one in Great Britain. He also became a member of the Seventies; a general authority in the church. Later in 1851, William, his brother Bolivar, and their father left for California. Once in Placerville, then known as Hang Town, Their father practiced medicine while William and Bolivar mined for a living. This pursuit did not prove as fruitful as planned, as William was not able to afford making it back to Utah until 1855, and at that time only made it with two twenty dollar gold pieces after the four years in California. Once back in Provo, Roberts fulfilled several assignments of note. Roberts was assigned among a group of men to find Chief Tintic and his company of men, who had been harassing the settlers. Also, Roberts was one of the men who left Utah to help the pioneer Saints make it all the way to Utah when many were trapped within the cold in 1856. In the year 1857, on their way to trade with emigrants in Sweet Water, both Roberts and a man by the name Daniel Jones were abducted by Crow Indians, but rescued the next day by travelers heading towards California. In 1858 Roberts worked in freighting and carrying passengers between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, California. On February 6, 1862, Roberts wed Maria Julia Lusk in Lancaster, Missouri, and subsequently he brought her to live with him in Provo. William Roberts became active in the community of Provo, serving as a member of the City council from 1878 to 1881, as an alderman from 1884 to 1885, and as the first postmaster in the state of Utah. He also participated in the first brass band put together in Utah county, as well as in Provo's first dramatic association. William Roberts died on March 8, 1912. and  References  * 2002. \\"Historic Provo\\" Provo City Landmarks Commission. * Randall, Debbie/ Warnick, Jill Thorley.

The property is enclosed by a dense thickening of forest belonging to over 200 acres of conservation land, and the grounds of the venue itself is composed of well-maintained gardens and fountains, two large banquet halls seating up to 250 people, a stone terrace, a back pavilion, a koi pond, and a waterfall. History The history of the property extends back over 200 years to the 1790s, when land on the Don River was granted to Isaiah and Aaron Skinner by Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe with the intention of building a mill to provide lumber to what was known as the settlement of York in Upper Canada.\\"Todmorden Mills Heritage Site: Background.\\" Toronto.ca. City of Toronto. Web. 28 September 2011. . A decade and a half later, the Helliwell family, who had emigrated from Todmorden, England, a town between the counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire, settled down in the Don area and renamed it Todmorden in memory of their hometown. The community of Todmorden soon became a bustling and significant industrial centre, with influential and ambitious families such as the Skinners, the Helliwells, the Eastwoods, and the Taylors who over the generations had successfully built and ran a series of mills (including a paper mill, a tin mill, a flour mill, a gristmill, and a sharpening mill), a brewery, a malthouse, a distillery, and the Don Valley Brick Works.Bonnell, Jennifer. \\"Don .\\"Residences and Structures in the Valley.\\" Mus√©e Virtuel Du Canada (MVC).

Tales of the Don. Toronto, Ont.: Natural Heritage/Natural History, 1984. Print. 135. Freeland was an equestrian aficionado and hoped to nurse his injured horse Silky back to health on the property, seeing its natural cushioning of lush forests as a healthy environment away from the city for his adored horse to recover. Silky‚Äôs health improved, and Freeland subsequently turned his focus onto promoting what he officially named Fantasy Farm as a new location for weddings, banquets, and meetings for important clientele from Toronto and beyond. Its well-maintained, horticulturally-inspired grounds coupled with the natural enclosure of the surrounding valley and forests was a welcoming haven away from the urban centre of the metropolitan for Fantasy Farm guests and the location quickly grew in popularity.\\"Workers' Housing in the Don Valley.\\" Mus√©e Virtuel Du Canada (MVC).

While regular exercise is generally a healthy activity, exercise addiction generally involves performing excessive amounts of exercise to the detriment of physical health, spending too much time exercising to the detriment of personal and professional life, and exercising regardless of physical injury. It may also involve a state of dependence upon regular exercise which involves the occurrence of severe withdrawal symptoms when the individual is unable to exercise. Differentiating between addictive and healthy exercise behaviors is difficult but there are key factors in determining which category a person may fall into. Exercise addiction shows a high comorbidity with eating disorders. Exercise addiction is not listed as a disorder in the fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). This type of addiction can be classified under a behavioral addiction in which a person's behavior becomes obsessive, compulsive, and/or causes dysfunction in a person's life. The next revision of the DSM (DSM-5) will include an addictions and related disorders section; gambling is the only non-substance addiction that is likely to be included. Other non-substance addictions, such as exercise addiction, are being researched but their inclusion is undetermined.  Classification  A concrete classification of exercise addiction has proven to be difficult due to the lack of a specific and widely accepted diagnostic model. Most interpretations of addiction have traditionally been limited to drugs and alcohol, which makes it even more difficult to identify addictive tendencies in exercise. While excessive exercise is the overarching theme with exercise addiction, the term also includes a variety of symptoms like withdrawal, \\"exercise buzz\\", and impaired physical function. Excessive exercise has been classified in different ways; sometimes as an addiction and sometimes as a more general compulsive behavior. Psychiatric case studies have shown that exaggerated exercise could lead to negligence of work and family life. With an addiction, individuals become \\"hooked\\" to the feeling of euphoria and pleasure that exercise provides. This pleasure keeps the individual from stopping and leads to excessive exercise. With a compulsion people often do not necessarily enjoy repeating certain tasks, as they may feel like performing it will fulfill a duty that is required of them. There are many opinions on whether concrete diagnostic criteria should be created for this type of addiction. Some say preoccupation with exercise that causes significant impairment in a person's life, not due to another disorder, may be enough criteria to label this disorder. Others say there is not enough information about exercise addiction to develop diagnostic criteria. , the term \\"excessive exercise\\" continues to be used while the \\"exercise addiction\\" model continues to be debated. Three main types of disorders are associated with excessive exercise: # Anorexia athletica (obligatory exercise) - When an individual feels compelled to exercise beyond the point of benefitting one's body. Individuals will participate in athletic activities regardless of pain, injury, illness, etc., and will try to arrange their lives in order to maximize workout time. # Exercise bulimia - When an individual has binge eating sessions that are followed by periods of high-intensity exercise. # Body dysmorphic disorder - When an individual is obsessed with parts of their body and perceive them to be different or odd. These individuals will create highly regimented routines in order to improve their perception of the \\"flawed\\" body part.  Signs and symptoms  Five indicators of exercise addiction are: # An increase in exercise that may be labeled as detrimental, or becomes harmful. # A desire to experience euphoria; exercise may be increased as tolerance of the euphoric state increases. # Not participating in physical activity will cause dysfunction in one's daily life. # Severe withdrawal symptoms following exercise deprivation including anxiety, restlessness, depression, guilt, tension, discomfort, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and headaches. # Exercising through trauma and despite physical injuries. Key differences between healthy and addictive levels of exercise include the presence of withdrawal symptoms when exercise is stopped as well as the addictive properties exercise may have leading to a dependence on exercise. Those who succumb to exercise addiction may experience overtraining, which is best defined as a ‚Äúcondition of poor adaptation to a chronic period of excessive stress caused by a physical exertion, resulting in the development of the syndrome, compromising the health and sports performance‚Äù. Overtraining includes one or more of the following : *Persistent muscle soreness *Elevated resting heart rate *Increased susceptibility to infections *Increased incidence of injuries *Insomnia *Decreased appetite *Weight loss *Impaired performance *Decreased motor coordination and force production Exercise addiction may also lead to mood disturbances. Those who undergo rigorous training without adequate rest are more likely to experience depression, anger, fatigue and confusion. In addition, excessive training may cause exhaustion of the autonomic nervous system. Some symptoms include decreased total testosterone level, an imbalance between testosterone and cortisol, decreased sympathetic tone, and decreased exercise-induced lactate. These chemical balances can lead to premature osteoporosis, where the lack of testosterone accelerates bone loss, and elevated levels of cortisol alters calcium and bone metabolism by ‚Äúincreasing bone reabsorption and decreasing bone formation or intestinal absorption of calcium‚Äù. Calcium undernutrition may eventually occur, accelerating premature osteoporosis.  Mechanisms  , the mechanisms involved in the development of an exercise addiction, associated with the transition from healthy committed exercise to compulsive exercise, are unknown.  Assessment  Different assessment tools can be used to determine if an individual is addicted to exercise. Most tools used to determine risk for exercise addiction are modified tools that have been used for assessing other behavioral addictions. Tools for determining eating disorders can also show a high risk for exercise addiction. The Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire was created by Thompson and Pasman in 1991, consisting of 20 questions on exercise habits and attitudes toward exercise and body image. Patients respond to statements on a scale of 1 (never) to 4 (always). This questionnaire aided in the development of another assessment tool, the Exercise Addiction Inventory. The Exercise Addiction Inventory was developed by Terry et al in 2004. This inventory was developed as a self-report to examine an individual's beliefs toward exercise. The inventory is made up of six statements in relation to the perception of exercise, concerning: the importance of exercise to the individual, relationship conflicts due to exercise, how mood changes with exercise, the amount of time spent exercising, the outcome of missing a workout, and the effects of decreasing physical activity. Individuals are asked to rate each statement from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). If an individual scores above 24 they are said to be at-risk for exercise addiction.  Treatment  Behavioral addiction and substance abuse disorders are treated similarly; treatment options include exposure and response prevention. No medications have been approved for the treatment of behavioral addictions. Studies have shown promise in the use of glutamatergic altering drugs to treat addictions other than exercise. Exercise addictions comorbid in patients with an eating disorder may be treated through psychotherapy involving education, behavioral interventions, and a strengthened family support structure. In treating the eating disorder, obsessions and compulsions produced by obscured body image ideals will also be treated, this includes exercise addiction.  Epidemiology  Most research has focused on adult population or on college students, but little is known about epidemiology of behavioral addictions in adolescence. A study conducted by Villella et al looked at a group of students and the prevalence of various addictions. His results showed exercise addiction was the second most prevalent, after compulsive buying. High risk groups that appear to be addicted to exercise include athletes in sports encouraging thinness or appearance standards, young and middle-age women, and young men.  Prognosis  Individuals with exercise addiction may put exercise above family and friends, work, injuries, and other social activities. If not identified and treated, an exercise addiction may lead to a significant decline in one's health.  Comorbidity  An addiction, by definition, includes repeated compulsive behaviors that negatively affect daily living. There are two ways to classify addictive behaviors: substance addiction and process addiction. An exercise addiction is a type of process addiction, in which an individual's mood toward a certain event becomes dependent on addictive behaviors. Many educational, occupational, and social activities are stopped due to excessive exercising. Depression may develop if exercise is neglected or may result from reoccurring physical injuries that limit exercise. Exercise addiction is often related to obsessive-compulsive disorder as exercise addicts may have obsessions or compulsions toward physical activity. Exercise addiction is also commonly associated with eating disorders as a secondary symptom of bulimia or anorexia nervosa. Approximately 39-48% of people that have an eating disorder are also addicted to exercise. When diagnosing bulimia, exercise addiction is referred to as a compensatory behavior and indicator of the underlying disorder. Research also shows exercise addiction influences not only the development of eating disorders but also their maintenance.  Animal models  As with many human diseases and disorders, animal models are sometimes used to study addiction. For example, voluntary wheel running by rodents, viewed as a model of human voluntary exercise, has been used to study withdrawal symptoms, such as changes in blood pressure, when wheel access is removed from mice.Kolb, E. M., S. A. Kelly, and T. Garland, Jr. 2013. Mice from lines selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running exhibit lower blood pressure during withdrawal from wheel access.

Segal is known for his self-portraits and his belief in self- discovery through art. Early life Born in 1904, Segal came from Macon, Georgia though moved to New York on an athletic scholarship and began to study art at the Art Students League at New York University. Before World War II, he became involved in the magazine industry, beginning in Germany where his clientele were based in the new plastics industry at the time. His later ventures introduced him to men's fashion, creating a newsletter and in 1946 helped establish the American Fabrics magazine. With the introduction of synthetic fabrics, American Fabrics, along with his later publications such as Gentry magazine, along with the International Color Authority, helped establish him in the business. By the age of 30, Segal became a millionaire. Paintings Since his days at New York University, Segal had enjoyed painting. After frequent visits to Japan, Segal began to study Zen Buddhism, studying with D.T. Suzuki. It is then that Segal began to paint more, particularly self-portraits. Finding solace in creating his works, his self- portraits, among his other works, often served as a vehicle for self- reflection and self-discovery. In the mid-1970s Segal attended a drawing class at a church in Dorchester, Massachusetts and met a young Ken Burns, whose friendship grew over time. In 1992, their relationship was solidified when Segal asked Burns to help him create a thirteen-minute film, on his life and work to showcase at an upcoming exhibition in Japan. Burns agreed and spent time documenting Segal's life and philosophy on his farm in Chester Township, New Jersey. Though one of his lesser known works, Burns's William Segal, along with his two addition films, V√©zelay (1995) and In the Marketplace (1999) about the artist, were well received.Jensen, Elizabeth. \\"The Man Who Captivated Ken Burns\\", The New York Times, July 29, 2010.

His mother was widowed shortly after his birth, then married the painter Filippo Indoni, who encouraged Coromaldi to paint. He then attended the Institute of Fine Arts in Rome, where he studied drawing under Filippo Prosperi. Subsequently, at the age of twenty-two, he met the Neapolitan painter Antonio Piccinni and also Antonio Mancini whose studio Coromaldi frequented. Art Works He exhibited in Rome for the first time in 1893. In 1894 he won an artistic stipend with Un Ritorno dei naufragi. With this award, Coromaldi travelled to Paris, Brussels, Antwerp, Monaco, and, in 1895, he exhibited in Stuttgart, where a pastel, \\"Il cenciaiolo\\".Il cenciaiolo bought by the Museum der K√ºnste Bildenden (see Catal., 1907, No 646, the painting was sold in 1922 at the D√ºsseldorf Gallery Paffrath.

It acts as a platform for developers and allows them the use of a graphical interface directly through a web browser to automatically generate the codes. It was developed by NetMake in the year 2000. Can be used on Mac, Windows, and Linux operating system. Using Scriptcase, PHP developers can generate complete online applications. Scriptcase is a rapid web development tool that aims to reduce development time and increase productivity. Developers need an environment (web server like Apache + PHP and a database like MySQL) on their desktop (or accessible via network or internet) to develop applications, for hosting the applications the server needs a webserver (incl. PHP) + a database. After programs are finally developed and deployed, Scriptcase is no longer necessary to run the application. Features Scriptcase can be used to create CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) applications. It also enables to add custom code to manage business rules and validation. Scriptcase lets you create forms, queries in PHP, ranging from simple forms to forms having high level of complex elements to manipulate data from databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Interbase, Firebird, Access, Oracle, MS SQLServer, DB2, SyBase, Informix and ODBC connections). It permits development with JavaScript methods that can be used within the AJAX events and create applications with AJAX through a set of features and services with easy and fast hand coding, such as navigation between pages or sections, automatic validation of fields such as date, currency, zip code and social security number, among others. The generated reports can be exported to MS Word, MS Excel, PDF or printed. Complex SQL statements can be used (sub-select, joins and even stored procedures). Scriptcase allows users to write PHP to handle exceptions and create more complex validation). Scriptcase is Compatible with RTL (Right to Left) writing, support right to left writing prevalent on Arabic languages. It is also possible to create infrastructure such as menus, login screen and security system with authentication, create tabs to group forms or queries to be executed on the same page. Platform development began in 2000. Since then, it has been receiving regular updates. It addresses Web Application Developers (both for desktops and for mobiles) in two ways: it enables starting developers with limited knowledge of programming (PHP, Java) and basic knowledge of databases (SQL) to build applications that read and updates data in Web Databases. But it also aims at the experienced developer, who can with Scriptcase put a lot more focus on business logic rather than editing forms, build database connections etc. The pricing model is about to shift from \\"buying the software\\" as till the end of 2016 to \\"lease as a service\\" from 2016 (due to a publication from the CEO to subscribers and current users of scriptcase from Nov 14th, 2016). Prices currently are 400-$600 for buying the software (depending on how many databases are supported) per developer. Versions The platform development started in 2000. Since then, the tool has received periodic updates and improvements. * 1.0 - Released 2000 - \\"Fossil Version\\". ** Was sold only for some customers in beta mode. * 2.0 ‚Äì 2003 ** Big Changes in the interface. ** Theme and CSS Editor ** Creation of SQL builder ** Export PDF ** Macros ** Security Module 1.0 * 3.0 - 2006 ** Native support for AJAX ** Creation of the concept of Events ** Stored procedure * 4.0 - 2008 ** Internationalization support ** Master-Detail Functionality ** Editable Grid ** HTML Editor ** Helpcase (documentation generator) ** New filter options ** Navigation using tabs on the internal interface of Scriptcase * 5.0 ‚Äì 2009 ** Graphics in Flash ** Creation of the container application ** Express applications Creation ** captcha security use ** dynamic menus ** Menu with \\"refresh\\" option ** Tree Menu ** New Security Module ** Logging module * 5.1 ‚Äì 2010 ** New implementations such as JQuery support ** Calendar ** Google Maps ** Quick Search ** bar codes ** flash graphics ** Container ** Field type YouTube ** New Themes * 5.2 ‚Äì 2010 ** Focused on editing and field types, creating the option \\"edit fields\\" ** Form: New field formatting, tabs, validation, among others. * 6.0 ‚Äì 2012 ** The biggest change was in performance, up to 5 times faster. ** New graphics module ** New security module ** New log module ** Database Manager * 7.0 ‚Äì 2013 ** Integration with PayPal ** Integrated social media Buttons, ** AJAX in Grids ** Mobile Menu ** New PDF generator ** Tool bar for menus ** Graphics in HTML 5 * 7.1 ‚Äì 2013 ** Multi-Thread Processing ** Change in interface ** Graphics with navigation on the Toolbar ** Friendly URL * 8.0 ‚Äì 2014 Scriptcase consolidation as one of the strongest tools of BI (Business Intelligence), migrating some features that help the end-user to make decisions.

Later, Descartes found him sympathetic enough to use as a sounding board, and potential intermediary with Pierre Bourdin, another Jesuit and critic of the Dioptrics. A letter to Dinet in 1642 attacked both Bourdin and Gisbertus Voetius, an opponent at the University of Utrecht. The letter also set out his position in relation to scholastic philosophy. By including it in the second edition of his Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes raised the stakes in these fights. At that time Dinet was in a position of influence, as Jesuit provincial in Paris, for the √éle-de- France.Desmond M.

It centers on the interrogation of high school student Gabriel James after several crimes have been committed. The story is told in first person and information is unveiled through Gabriel's answers to the detective's questions, often through flashbacks. The book won several awards, including the 2010 and 2011 Edgar Award for best young adult fiction.  Plot summary  The story opens in Billings, Montana where high school sophomore Gabriel James is interrogated by two policemen concerning two murders that he apparently knows about. The officer leading the interview is a suspicious yet sympathetic woman, and the second officer is a rude and quick to judge man whose attention to the interrogation seems to shift drastically from extreme interest to seeming apathetic. Their differences in style leads to several exchanges between them throughout the book. As the interrogation starts, Gabriel introduces his ex-girlfriend Anita and goes on to tell how he and Anita were forced to break up after her parents became aware of a camping trip the two took alone weeks before. This is the first of many problems Gabriel has girls and gives the reader the impression of a confused teenage boy. As the police continue to ask questions, they are introduced to Danny Two Bull and learn about a string of pet murders that have been occurring since the arrival of Danny. After transferring from a Native American reservation, Danny Two Bull joins Gabriel's high school cross country team. Though Danny is very reserved, he makes it known that he is there to prove that a Native American can outrun any white man. The pet murders are thought to be a threat towards Danny after he opens his locker to find a dead dog inside. As the pet murders continue, Gabriel gradually becomes more curious as to the people behind them and, in hopes of getting some information, asks a local homeless man named Durmond Williams if he has heard or seen anything. Durmond informs Gabriel of a pair suspicious teenage twin boys with a yellow truck who have just recently arrived in town. After being denied a date by a shy seemingly sheltered classmate named Raelene, Gabriel becomes obsessed with the uncovering reason behind the rejection. Several attempts to talk to Raelene push her away even more and this only fuels Gabriel's interest. The book takes a slightly creepy turn that leaves the reader with an uneasy feeling. As Gabriel's week prolongs the thought of Raelene turns into an obsession and he goes to her house late one night. While snooping around the secluded farm house he looks through a window to see Raelene naked in an aprin watching TV with her father and brother, each of them naked as well. Gabriel races away with more questions than he came with fueling this obsession even more. By now the story is coming together as flyers are being left around campus with a manifesto being signed by a one ‚ÄúDoc. Death MDD.‚Äù After seeing Raelene's brother with the twins in the yellow truck and the release of the flyers, Gabriel begins to suspect the three of them for the recent events. Determined to get more clues he proceeds to return to the secluded farm house one night. As he approaches the house he is attacked by a goose which in turn alarms the rather old father. Armed with a shot gun the man yells for Gabriel as he struggles with the steps. This gives time to retreat to his car all the while attempting to fight off the goose. Not being able to get to his car fast enough he runs straight into the twins and Raelene's brother. He is assaulted, immobilized and is forced to listen to the gang decide his destiny. After debating whether to kill or seriously damage him they decide to bring him into the house and let their father decide. When he gets inside he is forced into a chair, surrounded by the gang and the father begins to question his son about Gabriel. After discovering he is a classmate of Raelene's he sends one of the twins to move his car out of sight leaving one twin with a shotgun, Raelene's brother and the old father. During a discussion Gabriel manages to get a hold of the shotgun, and miraculously escape. The interrogation comes to an end and the officers release Gabriel. Feeling much of the weight lift from his shoulders he was left with the thought of the future and what legal matters still remained.

The ride opened in 1981 for the park's first operating season. The ride closed in 2006 and was partially dismantled but was re-built and re-opened later that season following the sale of Paramount's amusement park chain to Cedar Fair. The ride last operated during the 2018 season and has been completely dismantled and removed as of February 2019. History When Orbiter first opened in 1981, it was called Sol Loco and featured a Mexican theme. In 2002, the ride's name was changed to what it is known as today, Orbiter. After 25 years in operation, Orbiter was closed during the 2006 operating season. The ride had been removed from the park map and was surrounded by signs stating \\"Please excuse our appearance as we are preparing for your future enjoyment\\". During this closure period, several parts of the ride were dismantled including the ride carriages. This led many people to wonder if the ride would be demolished completely. That same year, it was announced that Cedar Fair would buy all Paramount Parks. Later on in the season, the ride began to be re-assembled and was re-opened to the public. On 4 February 2019, the attraction was fully dismantled and removed from the park.  Structure  Orbiter is mainly made up of 4 different parts. The first part is the yellow \\"arm\\" which supports the entire ride whether it is in operation or not. The second part is the centre red \\"wheel\\" which is attached to the \\"arm\\". The wheel supports the structure of the ride. The third part(s) is / are the number of white metal supports that support the 15 carriages where riders sit. The fourth and final part are the carriages themselves. This is where the riders sit when the ride is in operation. Ride experience Riders take a seat in one of the 15 carriages which hold 2 riders each (for a total of 30 riders). There is no seat belt or restraint system on the ride, only a cage to hold on to during the ride as when the ride is in operation, gravity will keep the rider in place. Once the ride operators give the all clear, the ride begins to spin in a circle constantly picking up speed. It can take about 20 to 25 seconds for the ride to reach its top speed and lift off of the ground. After the ride lifts off the ground, the ride keeps rising eventually coming to an almost-vertical position. A few seconds later, the ride begins to descend back to the ground. The rides braking system is activated and the ride comes to a complete stop by the time it reaches the ground. One ride cycle is about 1 minute and 53 seconds. As of February 4th 2019, Orbiter will not reopen for the 2019 season, this was confirmed by the park.

Clancey (born 1952) is a computer scientist who specializes in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. He has worked in computing in a wide range of sectors, including medicine, education, and finance, and had performed research that brings together cognitive and social science to study work practices and examine the design of agent systems. Clancey has been described as having developed ‚Äúsome of the earliest artificial intelligence programs for explanation, the critiquing method of consultation, tutorial discourse, and student modeling,‚Äù and his research has been described as including ‚Äúwork practice modeling, distributed multiagent systems, and the ethnography of field science.‚Äù He has also participated in Mars Exploration Rover mission operations, ‚Äúsimulation of a day-in-the-life of the ISS, knowledge management for future launch vehicles, and developing flight systems that make automation more transparent.‚Äù Clancey‚Äôs work on \\"heuristic classification\\" and \\"model construction operators\\" is regarded as having been influential in the design of expert systems and instructional programs. Clancey was Chief Scientist for Human-Centered Computing at NASA Ames Research Center, Intelligent Systems Division from 1998-2013, where he managed the Work Systems Design & Evaluation Group. During this intergovernmental personnel assignment as a civil servant, he was also employed at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition in Pensacola, where he holds the title of Senior Research Scientist. Early life and education William J. Clancey was born and grew up in New Jersey. He was a Boy Scout and rose to the rank of Eagle Scout. In an eighth-grade commencement address entitled ‚ÄúHumanity's Next Great Adventure,‚Äù given at a school in San Mateo, California, in 2002, Clancey recalled his own school years, when he ‚Äúalways got extra credit in eighth grade science, answering quiz questions about the latest Gemini two-person launches, getting us ready for the first trip to the moon in three years. I used to read these stories in the New York Times--absorbing every word. And of course when Star Trek began on TV in September, I watched the first episode and haven't missed any in 36 years. So space travel was on my mind as I sat at MY eighth grade graduation, and it's probably no coincidence that I work for NASA today.‚Äù He graduating as valedictorian from East Brunswick High School, earning honors in biology. He majored in Mathematical Sciences at Rice University in Houston, where in connection with his interest in cognition he took courses in a range of fields, including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, religion, and sociology. He has said that at Rice ‚ÄúI went through the catalog and took every course that mentioned 'knowledge' or 'cognition,' regardless of the department.‚Äù He would later write that ‚ÄúThe courses that had the greatest influence on my later work were 'The philosophy of knowledge' (Konstantin Kolenda), 'Language, thought, and culture' (Stephen Tyler), and 'The radical sociology of knowledge' (Kenneth Leiter). My advisor was Ken Kennedy, who taught a fantastic course on compilers. Altogether, I took 40 courses in 13 departments, including six anthropology and three philosophy courses. Rice's teachers were wonderful lecturers who inspired you with their own enthusiasm and the clarity of their thought.‚Äù He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received a B.A. summa cum laude in 1974. He then went to Stanford University, where he was engaged in expert systems research.[1] He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from that institution in 1979, specifically in the area of Artificial Intelligence, He has said that at Stanford, ‚ÄúI focused on Artificial Intelligence, but again combined different areas by developing a computer program to teach medical students how to diagnose a patient (combining computer science, education, psychology, and medicine).‚Äù His dissertation project, he has said, ‚Äúwas the first attempt to use an expert system for instruction.‚Äù He describes himself as having been ‚Äúa member of the 'Mycin Gang' in the Heuristic Programming Project, which became the Knowledge Systems Laboratory in the late 1970s. These projects were directed by Bruce G. Buchanan.‚Äù Career =Before NASA= From 1979 to 1987, according to Clancey, he ‚Äúmanaged research on Neomycin (one of the first second-generation expert systems) and a variety of associated explanation, instructional, and learning programs funded by the Office of Naval Research and the McDonnell Foundation.‚Äù He also designed ‚Äúthe instructional program GUIDON for teaching medical diagnostic strategy.‚Äù In his own words, he ‚Äúdeveloped some of the earliest AI programs for explanation, the critiquing method of consultation, tutorial discourse, and student modeling. My work on 'heuristic classification' and 'model construction operators' has been influential in the design of expert systems and instructional programs.‚Äù From 1988 to 1997 Clancey was associated with the Institute for Research on Learning in Menlo Park, California,[1] of which he was a founding member. It was there that ‚Äúhe co-developed the methods of business anthropology in corporate environments.‚Äù His ‚Äúspecial interest‚Äù at that institute, he has said, was ‚Äúin relating the cognitive and social perspectives about knowledge and learning. I worked on organizational change and work systems design projects in corporate settings at the former Nynex Science and Technology, Xerox (Customer Care Center, Dallas), and Kaiser-Permanente (Pasadena, CA).‚Äù Clancey has explained this work more simply as follows: ‚ÄúI worked with social scientists (anthropologists, sociologists, and educational psychologists)....We observed people in businesses (such as a customer call center) to understand how learning naturally occurs. We emphasized how people succeed in doing their work despite having inadequate tools or incomplete procedures, by studying how they helped and learned from each other.‚Äù He has also said that his ‚Äúbroad college background in computer science, philosophy, and anthropology...helped me understand the social scientists at the Institute for Research on Learning, so I could relate what I knew about computer science to what they knew about people.‚Äù Clancey co-founded Teknowledge, which describes itself as an ‚ÄúIT solutions & ITES company with specialization in Finance Domain, Stocks, Forex, Supply-Chain Management, Enterprise (BOT) Build Operate and Transfer Model & Mobile Development.‚Äù He was also a founder of Modernsoft, which produces Financial Genome, ‚Äúa unique business modeling software for Excel.‚Äù He was a founding Editor-in-Chief of AAAI/MIT Press, established by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and The MIT Press in 1989 ‚Äúas a publishing imprint founded to serve the information needs of the international AI community,‚Äùhttp://www.aaai.org/Press/press.php and he has also been a Senior Editor of Cognitive Science. =NASA= Clancey was at NASA from 1998 until 2013. Among his research at NASA has been the use of ‚Äúwork practice simulation to design and evaluate varying configurations of roles and responsibilities for people and automated systems in safety-critical situations.‚Äù In a 2000 presentation, Clancey explained how an awareness of the different types of cognition can aid in developing ‚Äúheuristics for recognizing extraterrestrial intelligence.‚Äù For example, participants in SETI ‚Äúmight look for very long phrases, modality blending (e.g., tasting shapes), noise that is actually music, and descriptions that articulate relationships that humans express kinesthetically as gestures and facial expressions.‚Äù He also talked about how current ‚Äúadvances in robotics and neuroscience are the beginnings of a process memory architecture that will become the foundation of a successful computational theory of intelligence.‚Äù And he pointed out that ‚Äúconsciousness is not a mystical phenomenon or a topic to be shunned, but is instead the key for understanding how human intelligence is possible at all, how it is distinguished from other forms of intelligence on this planet, and indeed, how it is distinguished from current computer systems. In some important ways, even simple programming languages exceed the capability of human consciousness. But in other ways, related to the flexibility of 'run-time' learning and relating perceptual-motor modalities, no computer system replicates the mechanism of human conceptual coordination.‚Äù In his 2002 commencement address, he described his then-current NASA activities as follows: ‚ÄúI am drawing pictures of space vehicles on Mars, but now I'm living inside them, and actually pretending we are ON Mars. I've done that in the High Arctic of Canada on Devon Island and more recently in the Utah desert, where I was the Station Commander for two weeks.‚Äù He said that ‚ÄúFor thirty years we've waited to carry space exploration forward. We're in a transition zone, what I like to call 'Standing on Columbus' dock.'...Today we are called by adventure to another land....It's OUR new land, a new frontier. We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years old. You just have to believe. Your...attitude...matters. You must believe in discovery and adventure. If you let other people say 'it can't be done,' I can promise you, you will be 50 years old like me one day, and we will STILL be sending tin cans around the Earth, round and round going nowhere.‚Äù In an essay entitled ‚ÄúLiving On Mars Time,‚Äù Clancey has described a two-week period in February 2004 that he spent in Pasadena ‚Äúobserving how geologists and engineers controlled the Mars Exploration Rovers. There were two active rovers near the equator on opposite sides of Mars, at places called Gusev Crater (the rover we called 'Spirit') and at Meridiani Planum ('Opportunity'). I was working with the Opportunity team. At the time...the Opportunity team was living their lives as if they were actually at Meridiani‚Äù - that is, living on Mars time, not Earth time. In a 2010 talk about SETI he noted that ‚Äúboth the nature of consciousness in humans and our belief systems affect our notion of what intelligence can be, how it might communicate, and how we would attempt to communicate with it.‚Äù He stressed the importance of ‚Äúbreak[ing] out of ways of thinking that are limiting SETI‚Äù and asked whether ‚Äúquestioning our assumptions about mortality, purpose, and humanity's long-term role in the Universe [could] inform SETI.‚Äù Clancey told an audience in February 2012 that the MER mission ‚Äúprovides a new way of understanding how computer tools and social organization can be orchestrated to extend human capabilities‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe story of planetary exploration today is about the relation of people and robotic spacecraft‚Äîmachines that are actually complex laboratories capable of operating in extreme cold with little power, packaged to handle the vibrations of launch, and work for years without repair. Sending these scientific instruments throughout the solar system is one of the great successes of the computer age and will surely mark our place in the history of science and exploration.‚Äù At the end of a May 2012 talk to a group of Eagle Scouts he addressed the question ‚ÄúAre we alone? Are there other beings like us in the universe?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúI think the universe is saying to us, 'Take a guess. The answer should be obvious' That could mean the Universe is an unimaginably large space full of a diversity of life and cultures ‚Äì in the memorable words of Carl Sagan, there are billions and billions of planets like Earth.‚Äù He concluded by saying: ‚ÄúEveryday I remind myself of where I am and how we are part of this incredible hum and vibrancy of life. And I feel an immense privilege to be alive now, knowing and enjoying this gift.‚Äù He has described his current professional activities as follows: ‚ÄúI am a scientist who helps NASA design human and robotic space missions, including what people will do (astronauts and flight controllers on earth) and the tools they will use (especially computer systems).‚Äù He has said that the skills required for his work are the ability ‚Äúto observe and describe how people think and work (cognitive science, psychology, anthropology/ethnography),‚Äù to ‚Äúinvent new kinds of computer systems (computer science),‚Äù and ‚Äúto think about complex interactions and recognize unclear ways of thinking (philosophy, mathematics).‚Äù ‚ÄúI have always been a research scientist, rather than a professor,‚Äù he has written. ‚ÄúWorking with students might have been exciting, but as a research scientist I have been able to focus on developing new ideas and new kinds of computer tools.‚Äù He advises aspiring scientists to ‚ÄúCarry out your own investigations, even if they have nothing to do with what your school offers you. Realize that many of the important ideas for the future are not in textbooks, but were published 100 years ago or more and have not necessarily been understood or appreciated by your teachers. This includes philosophy and psychology (such as the work of John Dewey) and what is called 'systems theory'....Science and technology are rapidly changing. You can contribute by finding the bits and pieces that interest you, becoming knowledgeable about those things, then bring them to the table when the world is ready. He has described his recent writing as ‚Äúspann[ing] a variety of topics that reconsider the relation of knowledge and memory: \\"situated robots,\\" neuropsychological dysfunctions, and how policies and plans are interpreted in work settings (particularly how the nature of the scientific method is adapted for doing collaborative scientific work remotely on Mars). Professional memberships Clancey was a founding member of the Institute for Research on Learning. He is on the Board of Directors of the Association of Mars Explorers and the CONTACT Conference. He is a member of the Mars Society, a member of the advisory board of the Constructivist Foundations, and chairman and Chief Technology Officer of Modernsoft, Inc. He has also been a fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics since 1986, of the Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence since 1991, and of the Association for Psychological Science since 2010.http://bill.clancey.name/ Miscellaneous activities Clancey often speaks about space science at schools, museums, and other venues. He has given talks in over twenty countries. He has described himself as having presented the results of his research ‚Äúin tutorials and keynote addresses in twenty-two countries.‚Äù Honors and awards On an appointment to NASA from the Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition (Pensacola), Clancey and his team received the NASA Honor Award and the Johnson Space Center Exceptional Software Award for an ‚Äúagent‚Äù system that automates all routine file transfers between the International Space Station and Mission Control in Houston. Clancey received the 2014 Gardner-Lasser Aerospace History Literature Award for Working on Mars.

New memories or concepts are embodied as physical relations between structures in the brain that include not only an encoding of some external contents but, very centrally, the perceptual and motor activities making up 'what I am doing now.' Remembering consists of an approximate re-activation of these structures, in place and in sequence, with the possibility of substitutions, reconstructions, and new interpretations. In this view, a few basic processes at the neural level can explain many different aspects of memory.‚Äù While Clancey has learned from thinkers like William James and the founders of Gestalt, his original contribution ‚Äúis a detailed exposition and extension of these basic ideas, revealing the deep links between perceptual-motor skills and higher-level cognition, a detailed re-examination and recasting of well- known cognitive phenomena and models into this 'conceptual coordination' framework, yielding some interesting novel explanations, and a preliminary link to some recent research in neuroscience.‚Äù ;Working on Mars Working on Mars, published by MIT Press, describes how the Mars Exploration Rovers (MRS) have ‚Äúchanged the nature of planetary field science,‚Äù enabling his team at NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena to remotely operate the MRSs on the Martian surface and thus have a virtual experience of being on the red planet themselves. A reviewer of the book notes that ‚ÄúClancey, while a computer scientist, is in Working on Mars more of an anthropologist at times, comparing and contrasting the people working on the mission. There are the differences between the scientists using the rovers to study Mars and the engineers who built and operate the rovers, roles that can lead to conflict but also cooperation, as he notes. There‚Äôs also differences within the science team, particularly between those whose background is working in the field and those who primarily work in the lab. The former often wanted to quickly move on to the next destination, while the latter often wanted to linger and perform more observations with their instruments.‚Äù Working on Mars received the 2014 Gardner-Lasser Aerospace History Literature Award.

It was created between 1972 and 1978.Personnages Oiseaux (Bird Characters), 1972‚Äì1978 Description Mir√≥ created it for Wichita State University's Edwin A. Ulrich Museum of Art, Ulrich Museum of Art in Wichita, Kansas. The mural is one of Mir√≥'s largest two-dimensional projects, undertaken when he was 79 and completed when he was 85 years of age.Bush, Martin H. The Edwin A Ulrich Museum of Art, Wichita State University. Wichita, Kansas: The Edwin A Ulrich Museum of Art, Wichita State University, 1980 Fabrication of the mural was completed in 1977, but Mir√≥ did not consider it finished until the installation was complete. Mir√≥'s mural as it appears installed on the fa√ßade of the Ulrich Museum, Wichita State University, Kansas. The glass mosaic was a first for Mir√≥, and although he hoped to create others, he died before achieving this goal. Intending to come to the dedication of the mural in 1978, he fell at his studio in Palma (Majorca, Spain), and was unable to travel to the event. The entire south wall of the Ulrich Museum is the foundation for the 28 ft by 52 ft (8.53 m x 15.85 m) mural, composed of one million pieces of marble and Venetian glass mounted on specially treated wood, attached to the concrete wall on an aluminum grid. The work was a gift of the artist. Donor groups paid for its fabrication by Ateliers Loire Ateliers Loire, business link in French Ateliers Loire, tourism link in English of Chartres, France and for its installation. The Ulrich Museum also acquired the 5 ¬Ω ft by 12 ft (1.7 m x 3.7 m ) oil on canvas maquette for the mural, but it has since been sold to establish a fund to support the museum's acquisitions and any repairs needed to the mural. The entire mural was originally assembled by an artisan at Ateliers Loire using Mir√≥'s maquette as a guide. Fabricated under Mir√≥'s personal direction and completed in 1977, the 80 panels comprising the mural were shipped to WSU, and the mural was installed on the Ulrich Museum's fa√ßade in 1978. The mural is a unique late work in the artist's career: one of Mir√≥'s largest two-dimensional works in North America and his only one in this medium. A six year conservation In 2011 it was announced that the mural would be taken down. The mural, which had been losing tesserae, was the subject of a two-year study to work out how it could be conserved. The mural is to be taken apart and recreated with a stainless steel backing. The conservation was estimated to cost three million dollars. The mural was reinstalled at the Ulrich Museum of Art in 2016.

It stars Randy Josselyn, Dianne Kay, Chuck Kovacic, John Franklin, and Vince Edwards. Its plot is about a boy who has to travel through several videos and static- filled channels in order to rescue his sister, who was snatched into the television because she sat too close to it. As it was thought the film's original release title would be confused with Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, the name was changed to Andy and the Airwave Rangers for 1989 video release. The film is referred to as a full-length \\"cheater\\" in that it takes advantage of film highlights gleaned from previous Roger Corman films Space Raiders, Wizards of the Lost Kingdom, Deathsport, Chopping Mall, and Wheels of Fire.  Plot  Andy Colby (Randy Josselyn) is a 12-year-old boy with too much time on his hands and an addiction to movies. He goes to a local video store looking for a movie he hasn‚Äôt seen and asks the crazy video store clerk (John Bluto), for a real adventure. He is given a new video that isn't even on the shelves yet. He is also given instructions to never let go of the remote and don‚Äôt sit too close to the television. Unfortunately, his sister Bonnie (Jessica Puscas) is instead sucked into the TV and Andy has to rescue her. In his haste he ends up letting go of the remote and gets too close to the screen. With the help of characters from past movies, Andy has to face many trials to get his sister away from the purple and barely menacing villain, Lord Chroma (Chuck Kovacic).  Cast  * Randy Josselyn as Andy Colby * Dianne Kay as Mrs. Colby * John Bluto as Video Store Clerk * Chuck Kovacic as Lord Chroma * Don Sparks as The Glitch * John Franklin as The Gatekeeper * Lara Piper as Bionda * Jessica Puscas as Bonnie Colby * Vince Edwards as Space Raider * Patsy Pease as Space Raider * Luca Bercovici as Space Raider * Drew Snyder as Space Raider * Thom Christopher as Space Raider * Don Washburn as Space Raider * Bo Svenson as Kor The Conqueror * Erik Estrada * Richard Thomas  Release  After its limited 1988 theatrical release as Andy Colby‚Äôs Incredibly Awesome Adventure, the film was released in 1989 as Andy and the Airwave Rangers. Over its various video releases the film was also titled Andy Colby's Incredible Video Adventure and Andy Colby's Incredibly Awesome Adventure. This film had little impact on the market of the late 80s. It is a ‚ÄòB‚Äô film and was considered so in its various straight to VHS releases. Though released in VHS in 1989 and DVD in 2006, the film can still be found theatrically at locations showing older films, such as The Cinefamily Silent Movie Theater in Los Angeles. Criticism Allrovi wrote that with the film's \\"crazy-quilt melange\\", its \\"young stars perform as well as possible under the circumstances (it's hard to be convincing while reacting to stock footage), but the film's acting honors go to Chuck Kovacic as the wigged-out villain.\\" The film had DVD release on February 7, 2006 by Walt Disney Video.

It was launched in October 2011 and runs five weekly draws on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Each week a different regional community interest company receives the funds, with 20% of ticket sale proceeds going to local health-related causes. It is operated by Northern and Shell.  History  The origins of the Health Lottery predate the National Lottery, to the failed National Health Service Lottery which had an abortive launch in 1988, before being declared illegal. The assets of the NHS Lottery were purchased in 2007 by Altala Group Ltd., a company run by Ian Milligan, a former employee of Camelot Group, the operators of the UK National Lottery. Altala went into administration in 2009, shortly before it was due to be granted its gambling licence, and was purchased by Health Lottery Ltd. After winning the licence, the Health Lottery was sold in February 2011 to Richard Desmond's Northern & Shell group. The Health Lottery launched in September 2011. Until the summer of 2018, the Health Lottery had operated 51 society lotteries across Great Britain. This structure was formally re-organised in July 2018, to form 12 new larger community interest companies (CICs) covering England, Scotland and Wales. The Health Lottery also re-organised its playing structure to ensure a minimum jackpot of ¬£25,000, and shorten the odds of winning any prize (now 1 in 9.7). In addition, the monthly Mega Raffle was introduced, in which one Health Lottery player wins a guaranteed cash prize of ¬£250,000. The first Mega Raffle was drawn on 1 September 2018. Game Structure The Health Lottery is drawn five times a week, on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Broadcasting From launch, draws for the Health Lottery were broadcast live on the ITV network during an advertisement break of The X Factor, paid for by Northern and Shell, and shortly after on Channel 5. Draws are currently broadcast at around 9:55pm on Channel 5. It was initially planned to be hosted by Eamonn HolmesHealth Lottery to kick off next week and be screened on 5 but as Holmes was employed by Sky News, he was dropped due to a possible conflict of interest. Melinda Messenger was confirmed as the host on 5 October 2011.Melinda Messenger to Host Telly Health Lotto Draw To celebrate the first anniversary of the Health Lottery, a new Wednesday night draw called \\"Win Wednesday\\" was launched. On 5 August 2015, it was announced that the Health Lottery would be extended to five nights a week, with previous National Lottery presenter Anthea Turner taking over as host of the new-look draws from 13 August. Controversy The game has been criticised for donating only 20.3% of the ticket price to causes, compared with 28% donated by the National Lottery. Spokespersons for the Health Lottery argue that the game will grow the market. Some attention was also given to the possibility that favourable coverage of the lottery in Desmond's Daily Express and the Daily Star amounted to disguised advertising, which was reported to the Advertising Standards Authority, who found the issue to be outside their remit.http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/4/The-Health- Lottery-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_173270.aspx ASA Adjudication on The Health Lottery The Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced in October 2011 that the Gambling Commission would investigate the legality of the Health Lottery, after questions were raised about the way the lottery was being run and the cost to smaller lotteries nationwide. Camelot Group attempted to take High Court legal action to have the Health Lottery's gambling licence revoked in 2012, claiming that they had not received adequate protection from the Gambling Commission. Camelot lost the case, a verdict described by Richard Desmond as Structure To circumvent the requirements of the Gambling Act, the Health Lottery is not structured as a national lottery, but rather as twelve different society lotteries, each one representing at least one local authority area within England, Scotland and Wales. Each society lottery is licensed by the Gambling Commission and operates as an individual community interest company, or CIC. Different CICs take turns in participating in a weekly draw so each week different CICs are represented and every region gets a share of the pot. Money is then donated to support health-related causes within their respective local areas. The Health Lottery ELM Ltd operates as an external lottery manager to oversee the society lotteries. The ELM charges a management fee of 0.5p in every pound, which provides the profit for the lottery owners. The allocation of funds to causes raised by the Health Lottery is determined by the relevant CICs and their partner charity, the People‚Äôs Health Trust, and not by The Health Lottery ELM Ltd. In 2010 this complicated structure was judged by the Gambling Commission regulatory panel to be \\"close to the line in respect of section 99 of the [Gambling] Act\\" and that while the structure was \\"capable of being compliant with the Act\\" it was \\"finely balanced\\". Concern was expressed that the individual lotteries were not to be combined into one de facto national lottery, as to do so would be a breach of the Act.

Palaceer Lazaro (formerly Butterfly of jazz rap group Digable Planets) and multi-instrumentalist Tendai \\"Baba\\" Maraire, son of mbira master Dumisani Maraire. Active since 2009, they have released four studio albums on Sub Pop. Their most recent album, The Don of Diamond Dreams, was released on April 17, 2020. Biography The pair anonymously self-released two EPs, Eagles Soar, Oil Flows and The Seven New (referred to as Shabazz Palaces and Of Light, respectively) in 2009 before becoming one of the few hip-hop acts to be signed to the Sub Pop label and releasing its debut full-length album, Black Up to wide critical acclaim in 2011. Black Up was listed #1 in Seattle Times music columnist Andrew Matson's \\"Local Top #10\\" of 2011. The duo released its second album, Lese Majesty, on July 29, 2014. The album was first premiered at Seattle's Pacific Science Center Laser Dome in April 2014. In February 2016, Butler announced that the duo were working on a new record, which Butler described as being about \\"our relationship with devices. Not just our reliance on technological devices, but the ways they make us live and present and manipulate yourself.\\" In April 2017, Sub Pop announced the July 14 release of Shabazz Palaces' third studio album Quazarz: Born on a Gangster Star. This was followed two weeks later with the announcement of Quazarz vs. The Jealous Machines, the group's fourth album and \\"monozygotic twin\\" to Gangster Star, scheduled for simultaneous release along with a short film directed by Nep Sidhu, and a limited-run book illustrated by Joshua Ray Stephens. Shabazz Palaces curated part of the program for the Dutch Le Guess Who? festival.  Collaborations  Shabazz Palaces frequently collaborate with and remix other artists, in the latter case often reinventing entire tracks. Notable collaborations are the supergroup WOKE, formed with Flying Lotus and Thundercat. To date WOKE have released one single, \\"The Lavishments of Light Looking\\", featuring George Clinton. Shabazz Palaces have also contributed to numerous Theesatisfaction and Porter Ray releases. Chimurenga Renaissance is a project led by Maraire, in collaboration with guitarist Hussein Kalonji and with contributions from Butler. The project released a mixtape, Pungwe, in 2012, and published it as an album on March 5, 2013. They released their full-length debut album riZe vadZimu riZe on March 25, 2014. Two EPs followed: Kudada Nekuva Munhu Mutema on February 3, 2015, and Girlz With Gunz on February 5, 2016. Shabazz Palaces are part of Black Constellation, a collective of visual artists, fashion designers, and musicians. The group has hosted \\"Black Weirdo\\" parties in Seattle, Toronto, New York and Minneapolis. They are also featuring on Battles' 2012 remix album Dross Glop; charged with remixing the track \\"White Electric\\", and collaborated on the track \\"IZM\\" on Battles' 2019 album Juice B Crypts. Style and influences Butler notes that the work of Shabazz Palaces differs from his previous work stylistically. He cites his primary influences as \\"abstract\\", pulling from podcasts and mixtapes. Butler attributes the use of African percussion and jazz overtones to his family's musical preferences.

It is one of the most important projects in progress at the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology. It is designed to cater to the needs of X-ray users, material scientists and researchers. Indus-1 has the distinction of being the first synchrotron generator of India with a 450 Mev storage ring. Indus-2 is an improvement over Indus-1. Indus-2 lattice has been designed in such a way as to give low beam emittance and high brightness. The lattice is a Double Bend Acromat with zero dispersion function along the long straight section. It has eight super periods each having two dipole bending magnets, four focusing and five defocusing quadrupoles and six sextupoles. Of the eight long straight section, three will be used for injection and RF cavities respectively. The remaining five will be used for insertion devices. The radiation source Indus-2 is in an advanced stage of construction near Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Operation It is operated round the clock by a team of dedicated scientists and engineers. Technical specification with a critical wavelength of 1.98 angstroms from bending magnets has been designed to cater to the needs of x-ray users. The ring has provisions for insertion of high field wigglers for the production of radiation of shorter wavelengths. It is planned to build a 5 tesla superconducting wiggler to provide radiation with critical wavelength of 1A. In addition, a 1.8 tesla multiple wiggler is also planned. The storage ring of Indus-2 consists of eight unit cells each providing a 4.5 m long straight section. The unit cell has two 22.5 degree bending magnets, a triplet of quadrupoles for the control of dispersion in the achromat section, two quadrupole triplets for the adjustment of beam sizes in the long straight sections, and four sextupoles in the achromat section for the correction of chromaticities. An additional advantage of this lattice is that the two long gaps between the focussing and defocussing quadrupoles in the achromat section provide a lot of space for accommodating beam diagnostics and vacuum devices. The dynamic aperture with achromaticity correcting sextupoles is more than 30mm in horizontal plane and 20mm in the vertical plane. The injection energy for Indus-2 is 700 MeV and the electrons in this energy will be injected into it from the 700 MeV synchrotron which is also the injector for Indus-1. The beam lifetime at 700 MeV will be about 30 minutes, adequate to store a 300 mA current. After injection, the energy of the beam will be raised to 2.5 GeV within a few minutes. The beam half lifetime at 2.5 GeV is expected to be about 24 hours. This will be achieved using six RF cavities operating at a total voltage of 1.5 MV at a frequency of 505.812 MHz. One of the straight sections will be used for beam injection, two for RF cavities, and remaining five for insertion devices, which include two wigglers. As an x-ray source, Indus-2 is envisaged to provide radiation from bending magnets and wigglers. The magnetic field of 1.502 tesla in the bending magnets will generate a radiation at a critical wavelength of 2 angstroms. One wiggler with an 11 pole electromagnet (1.8 tesla) will provide radiation with critical wavelength of 1.66 angstroms. Other wiggler with superconducting magnets with 5 poles and peak field of 5 tesla will provide radiation at 0.6 angstroms. It will be possible to operate Indus-2 at any energy between 700 MeV to 2.5 GeV. It is designed to have more than 15 beam lines for various studies including EXAFS, XANES, x-ray diffraction, x-ray imaging, XRF, and photoemission, Soft and Deep X-ray Lithography etc. External links * Category:Synchrotron radiation facilities ","title":"Indus 2"},{"id":"33243063","text":"Jordi Mestre Molina (14 September 1981 - 6 June 2020), best known as Jordi Mestre, was a Spanish actor and model, who became famous for his work as reporter on the successful, former Spanish TV show S√© lo que hicisteis....

John Gregorie, was an English orientalist. Life He was born at Amersham, Buckinghamshire, on 10 November 1607, and was from a humble background. He became a servitor of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1624, being placed along with his ‚Äòmaster,‚Äô Sir William Drake of Amersham, under the tuition of George Morley, afterwards bishop of Winchester. For several years he spent sixteen hours a day in study. His only teacher was John Dod, who directed his Hebrew studies during one vacation at his benefice in Northamptonshire. After graduating B.A. 11 October 1628, and M.A. 22 June 1631 he took holy orders. Brian Duppa, then dean of Christ Church, made him chaplain of the cathedral, and, on becoming a bishop, his own domestic chaplain. The First English Civil War deprived him of patron and stipend. He retired to an alehouse on at Kidlington, near Oxford. There he died on 13 March 1646; his remains were carried to Oxford and buried on the left side of the grave of William Cartwright, in the aisle adjoining the south side of the choir of Christ Church Cathedral. Anthony Wood called Gregory \\"the miracle of his age for critical and curious learning\\".

It is 6 miles southwest of Athens and 1 mile northeast of Albany. Lake Snowden is the largest of four lakes which form the Margaret Creek Conservancy District, covering about 136 acres with a maximum lake depth of 42 feet. The lake provides flood control, water supply, recreational activities, festivals and natural wildlife. History Lake Snowden was developed as a part of the PL-566 Margaret Creek Watershed Project with federal funds through the Farmer‚Äôs Home Administration and the Soil Conservation Service to try and control flooding in the area. The dam was completed in July 1970 across a branch of Maragret Creek. Recreation pool was achieved in April 1972. It opened to the public in 1972 and in 1998 Lake Snowden was purchased by Hocking College from Le-Ax Water District. The college owns and operates a fish hatchery at Lake Snowden that furthers local fish management and aquaculture. Hocking college also assists the Division of Wildlife in installing deep water fish structures, monitoring fish populations, and monitoring water quality. Recreation Lake Snowden offers a wide range of outdoor recreation with a grass and sand beach, swimming area and adjacent fields. Horseback riding and boating are popular, with 12.5 miles of horse trails and several types of rentable watercraft. There are 125 camp sites in four areas of the park: The Locust Grove, Big Oak camp, Hickory Camp, and Hilltop Camp. The park also has two shelter houses with seating for 75 each for picnicking. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources orders Lake Snowden to be a \\"no wake\\" lake or idle only lake in order to keep the lake's natural beauty and reduce erosion caused by large waves. A boat launching ramp is located on the south side of the lake, near State Route 50. Pawpaw Festival The Ohio Pawpaw Festival is held at Lake Snowden around the third weekend of September each year, for the local pawpaw tree fruits. The pawpaw is North America's largest native tree fruit which grows particularly well in Southern Ohio. Some popular events at the festival include the pawpaw cook off, the best pawpaw competition, and the pawpaw eating contest. Several Ohio breweries provide a unique beer brewed with the fruit's pulp at the beer garden.Ohio Pawpaw Festival Wildlife The wildlife includes whitetail deer, Canada geese, many duck species, beaver, mink, fox, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit and wild turkey. Birdwatching is popular: migrating waterfowl such as canvasback, common goldeneye or ringneck duck can be seen.Hocking Valley Birding Trail Bluebirds, song sparrows and northern harrier are also common species to the area. =Fishing= The primary sport fish species managed are channel catfish, bluegill, redear sunfish, largemouth bass and saugeye.

Groos occupied this house for approximately one year. He moved to San Antonio, and in 1880 had architect Alfred Giles design his home which became known as the Carl Wilhelm August Groos House. Originally owned by one of the early German emigrants to New Braunfels, the house has also remained in the hands of descendants of the early German settlers.

On May 20, 1870, he married Hulda Amalie Moureau of New Braunfels, and became part of his father-in-law's business. Groos built his New Braunfels home shortly after the wedding. In 1872, Groos moved his family to San Antonio, retaining ownership of the New Braunfels house. In 1879, the house was sold to Gross's sister Emile and her husband New Braunfels‚Äô Mayor Johann Friedrich Adolph Giesecke. A native of Hanover, Germany, Giesecke emigrated to Texas in 1846.

Wilcox is a retired associate professor in the writing department at Ithaca College. He is the author of six books on issues including the Vietnam War, nuclear power, and the Plowshares Movement.Ithaca College: Faculty Two of his books discuss the effects of Agent Orange, a defoliant used extensively during the war. Life and career Wilcox was born in Des Moines, Iowa. He graduated from the University of Iowa where he studied Sociology and English. He earned an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop and a doctorate in English and Expository Writing from SUNY Albany. Books on Agent Orange His first book on the subject, Waiting for an Army to Die (), recounts the effects of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange on US troops during and after the Vietnam War. The chemical was used to eliminate the dense foliage of the forests in Vietnam, which the US military believed provided cover to enemy fighters. Wilcox follows the lives of US veterans who argue that the chemical was toxic, citing health conditions including cancer and fetal deformations. The book helped bring to light the issue of Agent Orange in the United States when it was first published in 1983.Rebekah Wilce, \\"Through the Toxic Mirror: Vietnamese and Americans Continue to Suffer Effects of Agent Orange\\" PRWatch. September 12, 2012. Jon W. Mitchell wrote in The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus: \\"In 1989, Fred A. Wilcox chronicled the struggles that US veterans faced in receiving recognition for their exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in the book Waiting For An Army to Die. Twenty-two years later, the title still encapsulates the attitude adopted by the Pentagon and the VA towards former service members citing exposure to dioxins on Okinawa.\\" George Claxton, Chair Emeritus of the National Agent Orange/Dioxin Committee of Vietnam Veterans of America, wrote in a book review in Agent Orange Zone, \\"In the past thirty three years I have read every book published on the tragedy of Agent Orange and dioxin. Beyond a doubt, Scorched Earth ... is one of the most informative works of truth released on the market.\\" George Claxton In 2011 Wilcox published Scorched Earth (), a continuation of the issues he addressed in Waiting for an Army to Die. In it he examines the effects of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese people and their natural environment. Wilcox traveled with his son, Brendan Wilcox, whose photos accompany Wilcox's text, to Vietnam to interview individuals and families suffering from many health issues related to Agent Orange exposure. The conditions include Hodgkin's lymphoma, chloracne, severe birth-defects and various types of cancer, among others. About the book, Evaggelos Vallianatos wrote in The World Post (a partnership of The Huffington Post and Berggruen Institute on Governance,\\"It is eloquent, thought provoking, absorbing, daring, moral, and necessary. It is a jolt to historical amnesia.

He has a Bachelor of Science in Communications with a Minor in Art from the University of Maryland.  Career  Saman Arbabi started his career as an intern for the popular DC-based radio show Diamond in the Morning after an ABC radio show producer, who liked his sense of humor, invited him to leave his job as a cook at Hooters and work with the station. In 2003, he was hired at Voice of America (VOA) as the first Iranian video journalist. As a video journalist and war correspondent, he covered Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Egypt, Bahrain, UAE and the 2006 IAEA talks in Vienna, Austria.

Arbabi's progressive and edgy style was copied so much in Iran, it prompted Iranians to coin a new term: \\"Paraziti,\\" meaning \\"like Parazit,\\" to refer to fans who dressed him. Parazit's success inside Iran prompted Iran's state-run media to launch character assassinations against Arbabi and his work, even creating its own satirical show to counter the effects of Parazit.  The Daily Show appearance  On January 20, 2011, Saman Arbabi and co-host Kambiz Hosseini made an appearance on The Daily Show as guests. At the end of the segment, Jon Stewart proclaimed, \\"I just want to tell you, you are like our show, but with real guts and I'm proud to be considered in the same fraternity of humor that you guys are in.\\"  OnTen  In 2011 he created the award-winning hit political satire show OnTen, which has become Iran's second most popular satire show, after Parazit, with over one million Facebook fans combined.

Qiu was born in Nanjing in 1936. In 1937, her parents fled the Japanese attack on the city, and resettled in Chongqing. Desiring to be an artist, the young Qiu studied painting, and then taught it for a while. In 1963, she was assigned to work in a factory in Beijing in a job unrelated to her youthful aspirations‚Äîthe production of measuring equipment for the Chinese National Institute of Metrology (NIM). During the Cultural Revolution, many researchers at the NIM had been fired, and in 1976 Qiu was asked to become part of their staff. Although not formally awarded the title of researcher until the 1990s, Qiu worked in a small group established on her arrival and tasked to survey historical Chinese metrology. Although she officially retired in 1999, Qiu became attached to her historical investigations, and continued to work at the Institute thereafter. According to Robert P. Crease, as the focus of the Institute shifted, no new personnel were hired to continue historical research, making Qiu the last surviving member of this group at NIM. Up until the 1980s, the reference work in Chinese metrology was a book by Wu Chenglou (), Zhongguo dulianghengshi (), first printed in 1937 and republished/revised a few times since (1957, 1993). It relies however mostly on literary accounts. The subsequently published research, among which Qiu books are prominent, has put more emphasis on archeological discoveries. Her 1992 book Zhongguo lidai duliangheng kao catalogs 1,481 extant metrological instruments spanning the Chinese history from the Shang Dynasty up to modern times.

He was born in Waterford, Ireland, the son of James Walsh of New Ross, Co. Wexford, and Ellen Stafford of Carrick-on-Bannow, Co. Wexford. He attended Mount Sion in Waterford City, the first school founded and run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers. The Irish Christian Brothers were staunch champions of Irish nationalism, the Irish Language Revival and Irish sports.Faith and fatherland: the Christian Brothers and the development of Irish nationalism, 1838-1921 by Barry M. Coldrey (Dublin, 1988) Mount Sion established a strong and enduring tradition of hurling, which filled the young and impressionable Jimmy with a lifelong enthusiasm. When he left Mount Sion, James took with him not only the skills, but a determination to excel, which eventually led to his participation in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship of 1934. However, it would be wrong to think that Mount Sion was all sport and games. The ancient Greeks believed in a concept called arete, which means ‚Äòto be the best you can be‚Äô. This demanded the equal development of body, mind and spirit. The founder of Mount Sion, Edmund Ignatius Rice, took this concept to heart and undertook to develop ‚Äòthe whole student‚Äô. James Walsh was the living embodiment of this ethos. When he sat the exams for the Leaving Certificate, he achieved the highest score for mathematics in the nation. In the archives of the Leinster GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association), James is referred to as Jim Walsh (Civil Service).http://leinster.gaa.ie/archive/pdf/P40_69%20Finalis.pdf This was done to avoid confusing him with other hurlers of the same name, but it also signifies that Jim Walsh was among the first generation of civil servants to serve the fledgling and sovereign modern state of Ireland. Already fluent in the Irish language, he passed the challenging Civil Service Entrance Examination for Executive Officers, achieving 12th place out of the 250 candidates who took the test in 1926. His recruitment into the Civil Service meant moving from Waterford to Dublin. He first worked in the Department of Education, was seconded briefly to the Department of Finance, and eventually settled in the Department of Defence. While James was at the Department of Education, he met Nora Fitzpatrick of Kinsale, Co. Cork. She too had travelled to Dublin to embark on a Civil Service career. They married, and had four children: Margaret, Patricia, John Finbarr (Barry)http://www.iu.edu/~ovpit/bios/bwalsh.html and Elizabeth.  Hurling Highlights  James Walsh played half back (see Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions) for Dublin GAA and Leinster GAA. He was on the team that won the 1932 Railway Cup Hurling Championship and the 1933 Railway Cup Hurling Championship. He also played in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship of 1932 and 1933.http://leinster.gaa.ie/archive/pdf/P40_69%20Finalis.pdf His team won the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship in 1934, and went on to play Limerick in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 1934 at Croke Park, Dublin. Although Leinster lost after a hard-fought replay,1934 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final it was a proud moment to have played in the game that marked the Golden Anniversary of the founding of the Gaelic Athletic Association. James won numerous medals, and appeared on a National Sporting Heroes cigarette card published about 1934-5 by W.D. & H.O. Wills. Photographic proof for Sporting Heroes cigarette card What the papers said - Walsh the Pick of the Dublin Bunch Jimmy Walsh, the Civil Service representative, was the pick of the Dublin team. He struck back a great number of balls throughout the whole hour. He was always in the picture and completely eclipsed Martin Power. He certainly gave a very nice display. An Gaidheal August 18, 1934 'Leinster Hurling Final: Dublin Hurlers' Great Display' Jimmie Walsh (Civil Service) -- Right half back. Native of Waterford. Played for his native County and for the Dublin Juniors, and for Dublin seniors in last year's National League Final for the first time as a back. Doubtful if there is a better half-back playing. Excellent in both matches against Kilkenny. An Gaidheal September 1, 1934 'All Ireland Hurling Final: Who's Who on the Dublin and Limerick Teams' Walsh as Good as Previously Last week I expressed the view that Jimmy Walsh at right half-back was the pick of the bunch. The same can be said without any doubt on this occasion. The Civil Service man was everywhere at the right time; got rid of the ball in the proper manner, followed up to anticipate a possible return.

Discovery Map of fossil locality Gladocephaloideus is known from a complete skull and partial postcranial skeleton including traces of hair-like pycnofibres. It was collected from the Jingangshan Bed of the Yixian Formation, dating to the early Aptian stage, about 121 million years ago. It was named by L√º Junchang, Ji Qiang, Wei Xuefang and Liu Yongqing in 2012 and the type species is Gladocephaloideus jingangshanensis. The generic name is derived from Latin gladius, \\"sword\\", and Greek Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ, kephal√®, \\"head\\", en Œµ·º∂Œ¥ŒøœÇ, eidos, \\"form\\", referring to the elongated form of the skull. The specific name refers to the provenance from the Jiangangshan. The holotype, IG-CAGS-08-07, includes the almost complete skull, the lower jaws, the front neck vertebrae and part of a hindlimb. In 2016, a second specimen was referred, JPM 2014‚Äì004, a juvenile from the Jiufotang Formation. It represents an almost complete skeleton, missing only the left hindlimb, the rear back vertebrae, the sacrum and the tail. Though the holotype was originally considered an adult, the new exemplar indicates that IG-CAGS-08-07 was a juvenile also.L√º J., Kundr√°t M., Shen C., 2016, \\"New Material of the Pterosaur Gladocephaloideus L√º et al., 2012 from the Early Cretaceous of Liaoning Province, China, with Comments on Its Systematic Position\\", PLoS ONE 11(6): e0154888 Description 2016 life restoration by Zhao Chuang. The skull of the holotype has a length of . In 2012 several distinguishing traits were established. The snout is elongated. The main skull opening, the fenestra nasoantorbitalis, is small with 13% of the total skull length. The part in front of it equals 63% of the skull length. The total number of teeth in the entire skull and lower jaws numbers about fifty. The teeth have sharp points. The snout has a concave upper profile. A snout crest is absent. The parietal crest on the back of the skull is low and rounded. The teeth occupy the front quarter of the upper and lower jaws. Each upper jaw has thirteen teeth, each lower jaw twelve. The first four teeth in both the upper and lower jaws are longer and strongly inclined to the front; to the rear the teeth become shorter and more perpendicular. The pycnofibres in the holotype are visible as short hairs, pointing to the rear, at the back of the skull and the neck vertebrae. A deep groove incises the midline of the symphysis of the lower jaws. The longest neck vertebra is 4.1 times longer than wide. In the wing finger the first phalanx is the longest and equals the shinbone in length. The thighbone equals 61% of the shinbone length. The third metatarsal equals 40% of the shinbone length. Classification Gladocephaloideus was in 2012 placed in the Gallodactylidae. It would then be the first gallodactylid pterosaur found in Asia. In 2016 however, the new skeleton indicated that Gladiocephaloideus was in fact a member of the Ctenochasmatidae, as the sister species of Pterofiltrus.

Ground was broken for the parish church on April 23, 1866, and it was dedicated on January 1, 1871 by Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley of Newark. The spire was completed by Joseph Trier, a Trenton contractor, in 1879. It was said to be the tallest church spire in the state at that time. The clock in the tower was built by the Seth Thomas Clock Company for the Paris Exposition of 1878 where it served as the official time piece. The Diocese of Trenton was established by Pope Leo XIII on August 2, 1881. St. Mary‚Äôs Church was chosen to be the cathedral of the new diocese. Bishop Michael J.

Under a management contract a private company operates a water system for a defined period on behalf of a public authority and is remunerated through a fixed fee as well as a performance-based variable fee. In all four contracts the public partner is the local utility. The local utilities are all jointly owned by the national water holding company Algerienne de l‚ÄôEau and the national sanitation holding company ONA, which are both under the authority of the Ministry of Water Resources. The Minister of Water Resources, Abdelmalek Sellal, said in late 2011 that what is fundamental to the management contracts is not so much to ensure 24-hour water supply, but to \\"instill a new management culture\\" that regards water \\"as a commercial good that requires technological know-how and management skills\\". In other Algerian cities publicly owned and managed utilities continue to provide water and sanitation services alone without the support of private companies. The government announced that it will decide in September 2012 whether management contracts should also be introduced in Setif, Sidi Bel Abbes and Mostaghanem. The World Bank provided technical assistance for the preparation of the privatization of the water and sanitation systems in Annaba, Constantine and Oran, all of which were awarded after competitive bidding. It has not been involved in the preparation of the privatization of Algiers, a contract that has been awarded without competitive bidding. ;Algiers In November 2005 Suez Environnement of France was directly awarded a Euro 113 million, 5.5 year- management contract for Algiers. The local contractual partner, the Algiers water and sanitation utility SEAAL, was only created in April 2006. The government provides US$500m for investments during the period of the management contract. The utility has 460,000 subscribers and 4,400 employees. The objectives of the management contract are to distribute good quality water on a continuous basis, to improve bathing water quality, to rehabilitate infrastructure and to improve customer satisfaction. As of January 2009 the continuity of supply has increased from 16% to 80%, 7 beaches were opened to the public and extensive training has been conducted. In 2011 continuity reached 99%.

The contractual partner was the water and sanitation utility for the cities of Annaba and El Tarf, SEATA. However, the investment program stalled and the government cancelled the contract in 2010.

The problem with me is I can't put the two things together. This is an adult person, a little person ... it's so hard for me.\\" Handler responded with opinions deemed equally or more offensive by many critics. Rosie has since issued numerous public apologies via her Twitter account, including one to Little People, Big World star Amy Roloff, saying \\"i am sorry my words hurt u and made u sad - they were ineloquently phrased - i apologize and am pained at my own inadequacy.\\" Amy was quick to respond to Rosie's apology by tweeting, \\"I appreciate that Rosie.

In addition, the reviewer comments on her ability to maintain a fine balance of intimacy and fun when she interviews guests, demonstrated when she \\"discussed rehab with Mr. [Russell] Brand, a former drug addict, and breast cancer with Ms. [Wanda] Sykes, who caught hers early and is in full recovery.

Shortly afterward, he married Tara Deppert with whom he had two sons. Schmetterer completed his BS in psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1967, and completed an MBA at the same school in 1970. While attending university, he worked for the British Motor Corporation, where he originated the idea for branding and marketing accessories for their MG and Austin-Healy sports cars as part of the company's overall marketing strategy. Then in 1968 he was hired by Volvo of America as marketing research director.  Advertising career  Schmetterer joined creative advertising agency Scali McCabe Sloves in 1971 where his first client assignment was Perdue chicken, which would be named number 67 on Advertising Age's top 100 advertising campaigns of the 20th Century. In 1980 Schmetterer was appointed Managing Director and Chief operating officer of the New York-based Scali McCabe Sloves firm. In 1984 Bob Schmetterer became president and chief executive officer of an international joint venture with Young & Rubicam of New York and Eurocom S.A. of Paris, France: HCM Advertising Worldwide (Havas Conseil Marsteller). In 1987 Schmetterer then became a founding partner and president of the agency to become known as Messner, Vetere, Berger, McNamee, Schmetterer (MVBMS). Under Schmetterer's leadership the company was an early innovator in digital advertising and marketing, website creation, and in the first Internet \\"banner ads.\\" As a result of these kinds of innovations and progressively growing client base, MVBMS became the fastest growing agency in the United States in the early 1990s. In 1992, after being acquired by publicly owned French group Euro RSCG, Messner, Vetere, Berger, McNamee, Schmetterer became their New York office and Schmetterer was asked to join their board of directors. Five years later, he was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of Euro RSCG Worldwide. Schmetterer remained at the helm for seven years, as the agency grew to 233 offices in 75 countries and billing grew to $13 billion. Under Schmetterer's leadership Euro RSCG became the largest digital agency worldwide. By 2000, Scott Donaton (Publisher of Advertising Age and Entertainment Weekly) called Schmetterer a \\"visionary for new creativity\\". In 2002, in addition to his chief executive role at Euro RSCG, Schmetterer was named president and chief operating officer of French advertising and communications holding company Havas. Early in 2004, Schmetterer announced his retirement after thirty-three years in the ad industry. Schmetterer has managed the strategy and advertising for clients including Volvo cars in North America as well as globally, Pioneer Electronics, Maxell Tape, MCI, Dannon Yogurt and Intel. His advertising campaigns for Volvo also made the Advertising Age top 100 campaigns of the 20th Century list, coming in at number 90.  Author and speaker  In 2003, Schmetterer wrote the book Leap! A Revolution in Creative Business Strategy, which was published by John Wiley & Sons and eventually translated into six additional languages: English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and Chinese. The book was based upon the concept of \\"Creative Business Ideas\\": a concept developed by Schmetterer for use at Euro RSCG (that later trademarked the idea), whereby advertising agencies would go beyond pure advertising and communications strategy, and use non-linear creative thinking to develop ideas that could become central to companies products, services, and business strategy. Schmetterer has been keynote speaker at industry conferences sponsored by the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Cannes International Advertising Festival. In 2010 he also participated in The Future of Television Conference at New York University Stern School of Business.  Personal  Schmetterer has been married to Stacy Chiarello Schmetterer since 1987. Together they pursue philanthropic interests in the arts, education, animals, nature, and the sea. The two are also long-time yacht enthusiasts.

She was the first European liner with twin propellers and when first placed in service, the fastest liner in the Atlantic trade. In 1897, the ship was rebuilt and lengthened and in 1904 she was sold to the Imperial Russian Navy, which renamed her Kuban. Engineering The ship had eight double ended main coal fired boilers and an auxiliary boiler. The main boilers provided steam for the two inverted three cylinder triple expansion engines each driving a steel four bladed diameter propeller with pitch. Maximum power was about 25.000 ihp. Coal bunker capacity was 2,260 tons and consumption about 220 tons per day. History =Hamburg America Line= Albert Ballin commissioned Augusta Victoria and her sister ship Columbia in 1887, soon after joining the Hamburg America Line as head of passenger service. Augusta Victoria, the first to be put in service, was originally to have been called Normannia but was renamed for the Empress after Wilhelm II became Emperor. In the 1890s the line added the larger Normannia and to the series. Augusta Victoria was the first continental European liner with twin screws,According to Huldermann, 1922, p. 196, she was to have been built at a British yard, like Columbia, but the then Crown Prince Wilhelm insisted the job be given to a German yard. According to Straub, p. 45, it was a \\"not even publicly expressed wish\\". which made her both faster and more reliable. (The two previous twin-screw liners were the British-built City of New York and City of Paris of the Inman Line.) In May 1889, her maiden voyage to New York broke a record, taking only seven days.According to Huldermann and to Cecil, pp. 22‚Äì23, she captured the Blue Riband; according to Gerhardt, p. 33, won this distinction for Hamburg America for the first and only time in 1900. In November 1889, Nellie Bly sailed to Southampton on the Augusta Victoria on the first leg of her 72-day race around the world.\\"Around the World in 72 Days\\", American Experience, PBS, 1997, retrieved August 7, 2014. She was also the first luxury liner at Hamburg America, introducing the concept of the \\"floating hotel\\"; she had \\"a rococo stairhall, illuminated by a milky way of pear-shaped prisms and naked light bulbs clutched by gilded cherubs, a reception court choked by palm trees and a dark and gothic smoking room.\\" Ballin had her interior design work done by Johann Poppe, the designer at Hamburg America's rival line, North German Lloyd, whose ships already had a reputation for elegance. She was immediately successful, but she and her sister ship were an economic drain on the line because they required more coal than slower ships and could not carry much freight or many steerage passengers and were therefore profitable only in the summer season, and it was risky to operate them at all from Hamburg in very bad weather, when the Elbe was packed with ice. Off-season pleasure cruises were therefore started in 1891, and Augusta Victorias cruise in the Mediterranean and the Near East from 22 January to 22 March 1891, with 241 passengers including the Ballins themselves, is often stated to have been the first ever cruise.For example by Kludas and Bischoff; Gerhardt p. 36; Haller, giving 174 as the number of passengers. Christian Wilhelm Allers published an illustrated account of it as Backschisch (Baksheesh). However, the British Orient Line had offered cruises in the late 1880s. In 1897, the ship underwent a comprehensive rebuilding at Harland & Wolff in Belfast arriving in the graving dock 19 December 1896. She was lengthened by , her tonnage increased, and her speed increased by half a knot, and the middle of her three masts was removed. The new section was to be inserted between the second and third boiler compartments with an additional boiler inserted to total nine. Part of the original forward boiler compartment would be converted to staterooms. Her name was also changed to Auguste Victoria to correct an original inaccuracy; the Empress spelt her name with an e. =Imperial Russian Navy= While Augusta Victoria was under construction, the Emperor persuaded both Hamburg America and its rival Norddeutscher Lloyd to make their future liners convertible to auxiliary cruisers in time of war. Like all German fast liners built from then until 1914, she therefore had reinforced decks which could support gun platforms. In 1904 she and the other three ships in the series were sold to the Russian Navy; she was renamed Kuban and became a cruiser, but was assigned to be a scout ship. She sailed in the Far East with Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky's fleet in the Russo-Japanese War, but did not see action. She was broken up at Stettin in 1907.

It was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and designed by Groen Brothers Aviation (GBA), which has since been re-branded as Skyworks Global. Development DARPA's objective was to achieve performance with a rotary-wing aircraft comparable to that of a fixed-wing plane. The concept combined technical aspects of a gyroplane, which GBA had been working on since the late 1980s, with a fixed-wing business jet. The work was part of a potential multi-year, US$40-million, four-phase program. GBA, along with Georgia Tech, Adams Aircraft Industries, and Williams International, worked on Phase 1 of that program, a 15-month effort funded at $6.4 million. Phase 1B of the program was managed by Georgia Tech, using GBA as a subcontractor. Phase 2 development was to include a \\"subscale wind tunnel demonstration in the high- speed, high-altitude wind tunnel at NASA Langley and the building of a full- scale tipjet nozzle. Phase 2 anticipated to be a substantially bigger undertaking (valued at $24-28 million).\\" Due to issues with noise generated by the tipjets, the program was terminated by DARPA in 2008. In 2012, Groen Brothers Aviation was rescued by investor Steve Stevanovich as it was collapsing and nearly bankrupt, and was renamed as Skyworks Global in 2017. In July 2019, Skyworks partnered with Northrop Grumman-owned Scaled Composites to design, build and test its first VertiJet gyrocopter prototype, aiming for a 348kn (644km/h) cruise and a 1,000nmi (1,850km) range, to fly in 18-24 months. It could fulfil the US Marine Corps‚Äô armed escort requirements disclosed in April 2019, a rotorcraft that can keep up with its Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, as an add-on to the US Army‚Äôs FLRAA programme.
