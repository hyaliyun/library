Definition Peter Denning (1968) defines \\"the working set of information W(t, \\\\tau) of a process at time t to be the collection of information referenced by the process during the process time interval (t - \\\\tau, t)\\". Typically the units of information in question are considered to be memory pages. This is suggested to be an approximation of the set of pages that the process will access in the future (say during the next \\\\tau time units), and more specifically is suggested to be an indication of what pages ought to be kept in main memory to allow most progress to be made in the execution of that process. Rationale The effect of the choice of what pages to be kept in main memory (as distinct from being paged out to auxiliary storage) is important: if too many pages of a process are kept in main memory, then fewer other processes can be ready at any one time. If too few pages of a process are kept in main memory, then its page fault frequency is greatly increased and the number of active (non-suspended) processes currently executing in the system approaches zero. The working set model states that a process can be in RAM if and only if all of the pages that it is currently using (often approximated by the most recently used pages) can be in RAM. The model is an all or nothing model, meaning if the pages it needs to use increases, and there is no room in RAM, the process is swapped out of memory to free the memory for other processes to use. Often a heavily loaded computer has so many processes queued up that, if all the processes were allowed to run for one scheduling time slice, they would refer to more pages than there is RAM, causing the computer to \\"thrash\\". By swapping some processes from memory, the result is that processes‚Äîeven processes that were temporarily removed from memory‚Äîfinish much sooner than they would if the computer attempted to run them all at once. The processes also finish much sooner than they would if the computer only ran one process at a time to completion since it allows other processes to run and make progress during times that one process is waiting on the hard drive or some other global resource. In other words, the working set strategy prevents thrashing while keeping the degree of multiprogramming as high as possible. Thus it optimizes CPU utilization and throughput. Implementation The main hurdle in implementing the working set model is keeping track of the working set. The working set window is a moving window. At each memory reference a new reference appears at one end and the oldest reference drops off the other end. A page is in the working set if it is referenced in the working set window. To avoid the overhead of keeping a list of the last k referenced pages, the working set is often implemented by keeping track of the time t of the last reference, and considering the working set to be all pages referenced within a certain period of time. The working set isn't a page replacement algorithm, but page-replacement algorithms can be designed to only remove pages that aren't in the working set for a particular process. One example is a modified version of the clock algorithm called WSClock. Variants Working set can be divided into code working set and data working set. This distinction is important when code and data are separate at the relevant level of the memory hierarchy, as if either working set does not fit in that level of the hierarchy, thrashing will occur. In addition to the code and data themselves, on systems with virtual memory, the memory map (of virtual memory to physical memory) entries of the pages of the working set must be cached in the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) for the process to progress efficiently. This distinction exists because code and data are cached in small blocks (cache lines), not entire pages, but address lookup is done at the page level. Thus even if the code and data working sets fit into cache, if the working sets are split across many pages, the virtual address working set may not fit into TLB, causing TLB thrashing. Analogs of working set exist for other limited resources, most significantly processes. If a set of processes requires frequent interaction between multiple processes, then it has a ' that must be coscheduled in order to progress: If the processes are not scheduled simultaneously ‚Äì for example, if there are two processes but only one core on which to execute them ‚Äì then the processes can only advance at the rate of one interaction per time slice. Other resources include file handles or network sockets ‚Äì for example, copying one file to another is most simply done with two file handles: one for input, one for output, and thus has a \\"file handle working set\\" size of two. If only one file handle is available, copying can still be done, but requires acquiring a file handle for the input, reading from it (say into a buffer), releasing it, then acquiring a file handle for the output, writing to it, releasing it, then acquiring the input file handle again and repeating. Similarly a server may require many sockets, and if it is limited would need to repeatedly release and re-acquire sockets. Rather than thrashing, these resources are typically required for the program, and if it cannot acquire enough resources, it simply fails.

Personal life Said Akbar was born in 1921 or 1922 in Khost, Afghanistan. He was the son of Babrak Khan, a Zadran chieftain. When his father died, Said's brother, Mazrak became the new chief. Mazrak would fight against the Afghan government during the Afghan tribal revolts of 1944‚Äì1947 to support the restoration of King Amanullah Khan. Said was a minor leader in these revolts, fighting for Mazrak. Said had two sons, including Dilawar Khan. His wife was Musammat Malmal Bibi. Assassination of Liaqat Ali Khan On October 16, 1951, during a public meeting, Said Akbar Khan shot Liaqat twice in a park in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The assassin was fatally shot by police officers seconds later. Liaquat was rushed to a hospital where he died. Said Akbar's motives to assassinate Liaqat Ali Khan remain unclear as he was shot dead on the spot. Speculation as to Said Akbar's motives seem to lean towards the theory that Babrak was a Pashtun ultra-nationalist who had hoped that Khan's death would pave the way to a united Pakhtunistan. However, there are many conspiracy theories regarding the assassination of Liaqat Ali Khan which claim that Liaqat was assassinated on behest of foreign powers. Some say it was a reaction from the Soviet Union for his anti-communist and pro-western policies, while others blame the USA for ordering the killing due to Khan's alleged non-cooperation on the Iranian issue and an alleged demand for the US to vacate its airbases in Pakistan. Afghan government has, however, denied any role in the assassination of Liaqat and also disowned the act of Said Akbar Babrakzai.

It is most closely related to the Laughing gull and Franklin's gull and is the rarest gull in the world. It is endemic to the Galapagos Islands. Taxonomy and systematics First described by John Gould in 1841 from a specimen collected on Santiago Island in the Gal√°pagos. The species is sometimes placed in the genus Larus. It is possibly closely related to the laughing gull. Description The lava gull is a distinctive gull, and weighs . The adult plumage consists of a sooty brown to black head, which unlike other dark hooded gulls doesn't vary by season. The wings are dark gray with a contrasting white line on the leading edge, thought to play a function in displays and camouflage. Its dark gray body contrasts with a paler gray belly. The uppertail is white and grey lower down. The bill and legs are black, and the inside of the mouth is scarlet. It has white upper and lower eyebrows, with red lids. Immature gulls are generally dark brown. Lava Gull standing Distribution The entire population lives on the Galapagos Islands where it is found predominantly on the islands of Santa Cruz, Isabela, San Cristobal and Genovesa. Previously its population was estimated at 300‚Äì400 pairs; this estimate was revised downwards to 300-600 individuals in 2015. It is currently considered the rarest gull in the world. Behaviour =Breeding= Lava gull nestling Unlike most gulls which nest close together and sometimes touching, lava gulls are solitary nesters, rarely nesting closer than 100 meters apart. They are highly territorial, defending breeding territories of roughly 2000 sq. meters (70 m diameter) from conspecifics. They nest on the ground, often under the protection of coastal vegetation, and line the nest with plant material. They lay two olive-colored and well-camouflaged eggs that take 32 days to incubate. They generally nest close to calm water, often near lagoons. Breeding appears to be opportunistic and is not restricted to a single season. Young birds fledge at 55 days and continue to be cared for by the adults for several weeks. =Diet and feeding= They are omnivores like most Larus gulls, generally scavenging or stealing from nests and from fishers, but will also catch fish, small crustaceans, and newly hatched lizards, iguanas, and turtles. They also feed on sea lion placenta. On Genovesa they exploit the kleptoparasitic behavior of the Magnificent frigatebird, capitalizing on the botched attempts by these frigatebirds to steal fish from various nesting seabirds. Potential nest predators include owls, frigatebirds and other lava gulls, as well as introduced mammals. =Status and conservation= The lava gull is categorized as \\"vulnerable\\" by the IUCN Red List because it exists in small numbers and though the population is stable, it faces numerous threats.

Today he is one of India's most respected wildlife experts and conservationists, having produced and narrated documentaries on India's natural habitat for such media as the BBC, Animal Planet, Discovery and National Geographic. Early life Valmik Thapar was born in Bombay to Raj and Romesh Thapar, a noted journalist and political commentator who founded political journal Seminar in 1959. The historian Romila Thapar is his aunt. He married theatre personality Sanjana Kapoor and the couple have a son, Hamir. They live in Delhi. Career Valmik Thapar spent decades following the fortunes of India's tiger population. He was influenced by Fateh Singh Rathore. His stewardship of the Ranthambore Foundation was recognised and he was appointed a member of the Tiger Task Force of 2005 by the Government of India. He criticised the majority Task Force view in his dissent note as excessively focussed on the prospects of co-existence of tigers and humans, which was, in his view not consistent with the objective of the panel. A tiger in India's Bandhavgarh reserve in 2006 His writings have analysed the perceived failure of Project Tiger, a conservation apparatus created in 1973 by the Government of India. He has critiqued Project Tiger, drawing attention to its mismanagement by a forest bureaucracy that is largely not scientifically trained. His most recent book The Last Tiger (Oxford University Press) makes this case strongly. Among the consistent criticisms levelled by Thapar at India's Ministry of Environment and Forests relates to its unwillingness to curb poaching through armed patrols and its refusal to open forests to scholarly scientific enquiry. His famous relationship with 'Macchli' a female tigress is documented in some of his chronicles.http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k4/nov/nov64.htm  His view on Ranthambore Tiger T24 transfer to Zoo  As per the Hindustan Times Joining the debate on the fate of T-24 (tiger) (Ustad), Valmik Thapar, one of India's most respected wildlife experts and conservationists, said relocating Ustad was the best option: ‚ÄúIn my 40 years of experience of the tigers of Ranthambore, T-24 is the most dangerous tiger I have ever encountered. He killed four people, including two forest guards and two locals. The local villagers were partly eaten. The forest guards were not eaten because their bodies were retrieved keeping the tiger at bay. ‚ÄúAfter the first two kills I had suggested that this tiger be relocated to a captive enclosure but the tiger was given the benefit of the doubt. Later, two forest personnel have had to sacrifice their lives as a result. T-24 (9-years-old) territory included the path pilgrims take to and around the sacred Ganesha temple and Ranthambore fort. This last kill took place at the entry point of pilgrims and in daylight. ‚ÄúThe forest department and the government of Rajasthan have done a spectacularly successful job in relocating a man killing and eating tiger to a one hectare enclosure in Udaipur where he has eaten and is calm and where he will spend his last years. By doing this they have made Ranthambore safer for the brave forest guards who patrol and the tens of thousands of pilgrims who walk. ‚ÄúOur feelings today must be for the families who suffered tragically in these five years that have gone by. It is for these families that we need to collect money and help. Any person or group who believed that he should have not been relocated would have to bear the responsibility on their shoulders for the next human kill and the accelerating conflict that could result. T-24 was given the maximum benefit of doubt that any man-eating tiger has ever got in recent Indian history.‚Äù http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ustad-is- dangerous-should-be-in-captivity-wildlife-expert/article1-1348609.aspx Selected TV works *Tiger Crisis *Land of the Tiger *Tigers' Fortress *Danger in Tiger Paradise *Search for Tigers *Overpopulation Bibliography Books by Valmik Thapar 1\\\\.

A barrister by profession, he worked to defend the rights of Jains, and wrote and lectured extensively on Jainism, other religions, and philosophy. Background and early accomplishments Poster announcing lecture by Virachand Gandhi Gandhi was born on 25 August 1864 in Mahuva near Bhavnagar (now in Gujarat, India), to Mahuva Nagar Sheth and Raghavji Tejpalji Gandhi. His father, Raghavji, was a businessman.Virachand Gandhi After completing primary and secondary school in Mahuva, Gandhi was sent to Bhavnagar for further studies. In 1879, Gandhi married Jiviben. At the age of sixteen, upon placing first on the Bhavanagar matriculation examination, he was awarded the ‚ÄòShri Jaswant Singhji‚Äô scholarship. Gandhi continued his education at Elphinstone College, of the University of Bombay. He graduated with honors in 1884, having earned a bachelor's degree in law. Gandhi was a polyglot who spoke fourteen languages, including Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali, English, Prakrit, Sanskrit, and French. Gandhi was a friend of Mahatma Gandhi, and joined Mahatma in his \\"experiments in dietetics\\" (vegetarianism). Virchand helped Mahatma in the latter's struggle to establish a legal practice. In 1885, at the age of 21, he became the first honorary secretary of the Jain Association of India. During his term, he fought against a tax being levied by the ruler of Princely State of Palitana on pilgrims visiting Mount Shatrunjaya, Palitana. During the course of this fight Gandhi met Lord Reay, the British colonial governor of Bombay, and Colonel John Watson of the Kathiawar Agency. With the help of these two individuals, he ultimately negotiated an annual fixed payment of Rs. 15000, rather than an individual tax on each pilgrim. Gandhi also fought to close a pig slaughterhouse that had been started in 1891 close to Mount Shikharji, a holy place of Jain pilgrimage. Gandhi spent six months in Calcutta learning Bengali and preparing his case against the slaughterhouse. He was eventually successful in getting the slaughterhouse closed. Hewivitarne Dharmapala, Swami Vivekananda, and (possibly) G. Bonet Maury Trip to the World Parliament of Religions Gandhi represented Jainism at the first World Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago in 1893. Jain monk Acharya Vijayanandsuri, also known as Acharya Atmaram, had initially been invited to represent Jainism at the Parliament, but as Jain monks do not travel overseas, he could not attend. Atmaram recommended Gandhi to go in his stead and serve as the emissary for the religion. Atmaram and his disciple Vallabhsuri trained Gandhi for six months. Poster calling Gandhi 'a most eloquent scholar and linguist' Gandhi received a positive response at the Parliament and was asked to deliver more lectures. He ultimately stayed two years in the US and one year in the UK He went outside India to promote Jain values on two other occasions, and is known for giving about 535 lectures on Jainism and having attracted followers from outside India to Jainism. He was awarded various medals for his lectures. He was a contemporary to Swami Vivekanand, who deeply admired him. He faced criticism over his sea voyage, which was at the time considered unholy. Vivekanand, impressed with Gandhi's adherence to vegetarianism in the face of the cold Chicago climate, came to his defence: in an 1894 letter to Haridas Viharidas Desai, Diwan of Junagadh, he wrote \\"Now here is Virchand Gandhi, the Jain whom you knew well in Bombay. This man never takes anything but mere vegetables even in this terribly cold climate and tooth and nail tries to defend his countrymen and the religion. The people of this country like him very well. But what are they doing who sent him over? They are trying to outcast him.\\" Herbert Warren, who studied Jainism under Gandhi and adopted the Jain religion, published a book on Gandhi's lectures titled Herbert Warren's Jainism. The American newspaper, the Buffalo Courier, wrote regarding Gandhi, \\"of all Eastern scholars, it was this youth whose lectures on Jain Faith and Conduct was listened to with the greatest interest and attention\\". Later, in Kasadova, he delivered a lecture on 'Some Mistakes Corrected' on 8 August 1894, which prompted the citizens of the city to award him a gold medal. Gandhi had studied Buddhism, Vedanta Philosophy, Christianity, and western philosophy. He praised Mogul Emperor Akbar for his equal treatment of all religions. From Left to Right ‚Äì Narasima Charya, Lakshmi Narain, Swami Vivekananda, Hewivitarne Dharmapala, Virachand Raghav Gandhi Gandhi propagated the relevance of Jain tenets and Mahavira's message of nonviolence. He delivered about 535 speeches on Jainism, other religions, and social and cultural lives in India, all of which received wide publication. He was invited two more times, first in 1897, and then in 1899 to the West.

It opened in 1976 and operated by what was then the New York State Department of Correctional Services. The prison had a capacity of 931 male inmates. The prison property bordered Arthur Kill, a waterway that separates Staten Island from New Jersey. The Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve is located just south of the prison site. Part of its site contains buried truck trailers and is potentially contaminated; the decision was made to \\"deal\\" with the abandoned trailers' contents in this way.  History  Opened in 1976, the site formerly served as a 650-bed drug rehabilitation center, with an indoor swimming pool (closed when it became a prison); the housing of that unit was destroyed by fire. Sixteen housing (dormitory) units, the medical building and the SHU or Special Housing Unit were built just before or while it was a prison. In the summer of 2006, the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility was used to shoot scenes for the juvenile detention center shown in the film Tenderness.

Among his best known designs are the obverse (front) and reverse of the United States quarter dollar featuring the profile of George Washington, a coin that has been in continuous circulation with some modifications since 1932. Washington quarter Flanagan designed the Washington U.S. quarter dollar coin, which was issued in 1932. Flanagan's initials can be found at the base of Washington's neck. He designed both sides of the quarter, adapting the obverse profile of the United States's first president from a bust of Washington initially produced by French neoclassical sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon in 1786. His original design for the quarter continued through 1998, after which the new \\"State Quarter\\" series resulted in the modification of Flanagan's portrait of Washington and the removal altogether of the reverse design.

Plot summary Two major alien civilizations, the Amplitur (a squid-like species with telepathic and mind-controlling abilities ‚Äì which they couch as \\"suggestions\\") and The Weave (a confederacy of more or less equal species), have been fighting a war for several millennia. The Amplitur are attempting to join all sentient species in what they call the \\"Purpose\\", an alliance they \\"guide\\" to some unknown (even to them) end. The Weave is a group of species allied in opposition to the Purpose. Most of the fighting takes place on planetary surfaces, and is relatively restrained in terms of destruction, the purpose of the war being to convince and control one's opponents rather than destroy them. However, most sentient species in the galaxy have evolved to be incapable of committing violence against other sentients (violence of any sort being most uncivilized, but against another sentient being a [literally] unthinkable crime), which leaves a shortage of warriors on both sides. The Amplitur, with their mind- controlling abilities and therefore ease with which they control conquered populations, have gradually been pushing the Weave back for centuries and seem to be on track for final victory. On a mission to find new resources and allies, a Weave scout ship discovers Earth circa late 20th/early 21st century and finds that humans are uniquely suited as allies, in that they have the ability to fight, are adaptable to a wide variety of environments, have few (or sometimes no) compunctions regarding war (humans having been fighting each other for all of their recorded history), and above all seem even more enthusiastic when their aggression is focused on non-humans. Eventually Weave xenopsychologists determine that Earth's fragmented continents resulted in a species that evolved to fight, compete, and kill for dominance. They surmise that all humans are born hunters and killers, but that intelligence is starting to drive them toward the abhorrence of violence that other \\"civilized\\" species consider normal. When humans are unleashed upon the battlefield, all inhibitions against killing other humans are disregarded. Humans have no problem hunting and slaughtering non-humans, and some seem to enjoy it. This is appalling to the civilized races of the Weave, but they cannot deny the efficacy of human combat troops. Humans have the potential to become fearsome allies for the Weave and are also physiologically immune to the Amplitur mind control abilities. After the Weave scouts convince volunteers (mercenaries) from Earth to join the war, the tide turns for the Weave and the main conflict towards the end of the series becomes a question of what will happen to the new warriors when the war finally ends if they have not become more civilized (and therefore, less effective allies). Throughout the book the humans are greatly feared by the rest of the Weave because of the human race's violent tendencies. (The rest of the galaxy's species lived in harmony amongst themselves before they developed enough to reach out into space.) The first book deals with the Weave and humans trying to come to terms with each other, the first humans begin to fight in the war and the Amplitur attempt to capture Earth to deny the Weave their new allies. The second book details the outcome of the capture of some humans by the Amplitur, who genetically engineer them to become susceptible to the Amplitur telepathic abilities. Weave scientists' attempt to reverse this engineering on the repatriated humans had the (unknown to the Amplitur and Weave alike) side effect of giving those humans mind-control talents as well. When the newly- returned humans realize their abilities, they form a secret society called the Core, whose existence is unknown to even other humans. They fight the war telepathically as well as physically. The third book, set a few hundred years later, follows the research of a Wais scientist, Lalelelang, studying humans. The Wais are a delicate, highly civilized ornithorp race and are the most averse to violence of all the Weave species. Some members of this race can be shocked into a catatonic state at the mere sight of violence, which makes Lalelelang's friends, family, and colleagues all the more fearful for her chosen subject of study. During the course of her research, she comes to the conclusion that unless humans can be 'civilized' somehow, they will eventually turn on the rest of the Weave races once the war is over. She embarks on a quest to keep this from happening, and is joined by one of the descendants of the 'altered' humans from the second book. Unknown to Lalelelang, she will discover shocking things about not only the telepathic humans, but a couple of alien species from the first two books as well as herself. Significant parts of the action of the novels take place between the various non-human species that make up both The Weave and the Amplitur's allies, giving an outside perspective of \\"normal\\" human interactions and events as the author's apparent commentary on current events.

His music is preserved in an illuminated manuscript called the Capirola Lutebook, which is considered to be one of the most important sources of lute music of the early 16th century. Life and music A page from the Capirola Lutebook He was probably from Brescia, and is known to have lived in that city for several periods of his life, although he was in Venice in 1517 and for some time after that, the period during which the illuminated manuscript was prepared. It is possible that Capirola is the famous Brescian lutenist who visited the court of Henry VIII of England, although his name was not recorded (no other virtuoso lutenists of the period, from Brescia, who were also noblemen, are known). The Lutebook contains the earliest known examples of legato and non-legato indications, as well as the earliest known dynamic indications. The pieces vary from simple studies suitable for beginners on the instrument, to immensely demanding virtuoso pieces. There are also 13 ricercars in the book, which alternate passages in brilliant toccata style with passages in three-part counterpoint similar to that of the vocal music of contemporary composers such as Jacob Obrecht. In addition to music by Capirola (and others -- Capirola evidently transcribed several pieces by other composers for the book), the Lutebook contains a preface which is one of the most important primary sources on early 16th century lute-playing. It includes information on how to play legato and tenuto, and how to perform ornaments of various types, how to choose the best fingering for passagework. It also includes very practical details such as how to string and tune the instrument. Notes # Reese, p. 521\\\\. References and further reading *Gustave Reese, Music in the Renaissance.

Part 3, January 19, 1799 (in Russian)Fonvizin, Denis Ivanovich at the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary (in Russian) Denis Fonvizin received good education at the Imperial Moscow University and very early began writing and translating. He entered the civil service, becoming secretary to Count Nikita Panin, one of the great noblemen of Catherine the Great's reign. Because of Panin's protection, Fonvizin was able to write critical plays without fear of being arrested, and, in the late 1760s, he brought out the first of his two famous comedies, The Brigadier-General. A man of means, he was always a dilettante rather than a professional author, though he became prominent in literary and intellectual circles. In 1777-78 he traveled abroad, the principal aim of his journey being the medical faculty of Montpellier. He described his voyage in his Letters from France ‚Äî one of the most elegant specimens of the prose of the period, and the most striking document of that anti-French nationalism which in the Russian elite of the time of Catherine went hand in hand with a complete dependence on French literary taste. In 1782 appeared Fonvizin's second and best comedy The Minor, which definitely classed him as the foremost of Russian playwrights. His last years were passed in constant suffering and traveling abroad for his health. He died in Saint Petersburg in 1792. Works and influence Fonvizin's reputation rests almost entirely on his two comedies, which are beyond doubt the most popular Russian plays before Aleksander Griboyedov's Woe from Wit. They are both in prose and adhere to the canons of classical comedy. Fonvizin's principal model, however, was not Moli√®re, but the great Dano-Norwegian playwright Ludvig Holberg, whom he read in German, and some of whose plays he had translated. Both comedies are plays of social satire with definite axes to grind. The Brigadier-General is a satire against the fashionable French semi-education of the petits-ma√Ætres. It is full of excellent fun, and though less serious than The Minor, it is better constructed. But The Minor, though imperfect in dramatic construction, is a more remarkable work and justly considered Fonvizin's masterpiece. The point of the satire in The Minor is directed against the brutish and selfish crudeness and barbarity of the uneducated country gentry. The central character, Mitrofanushka, is the accomplished type of vulgar and brutal selfishness, unredeemed by a single human feature ‚Äî even his fondly doting mother gets nothing from him for her pains. The dialogue of these vicious characters (in contrast to the stilted language of the lovers and their virtuous uncles) is true to life and finely individualized; and they are all masterpieces of characterization ‚Äî a worthy introduction to the great portrait gallery of Russian fiction. As a measure of its popularity, several expressions from The Minor have been turned into proverbs, and many authors (amongst whom Alexander Pushkin) regularly cite from this play, or at least hint to it by mentioning the characters' names .

It was the first road in Hong Kong, constructed by the British between 1841 and 1843, spanning across Victoria City from Shek Tong Tsui to Wan Chai. At various points along the route, Queen's Road marks the original shoreline before land reclamation projects permanently extended land into Victoria Harbour. The four sections of the roads are, from west to east: Queen's Road West (Chinese: ÁöáÂêéÂ§ßÈÅìË•ø), Queen's Road Central (ÁöáÂêéÂ§ßÈÅì‰∏≠), Queensway (ÈáëÈêòÈÅì), and Queen's Road East (ÁöáÂêéÂ§ßÈÅìÊù±). History The road was originally 4 miles (6.5 km) long. The Royal Engineers built the first section to Sai Ying Pun with the help of 300 coolies from Kowloon (Hong Kong), then a territory of China. This section of Queen's Road ran parallel to the beach where Sir Henry Pottinger set up his tent in 1842. Originally named Main Street, it was officially renamed Queen's Road in March 1842 after Queen Victoria of the British Empire.CityLife: Queen's Road Central It was mistakenly translated into Chinese as ÁöáÂêé, meaning \\"queen consort\\". When Hong Kong was founded as a British Crown Colony in 1842, Queen's Road was the hub of the island's activity. The development of this island had been haphazard: winding paths connected the Hong Kong Club for tai-pans and ran along squatter huts, military encampments and taverns. The first governors built their homes along Queen's Road; subsequently, the first post office and Christian churches soon arrived. Instead of a properly paved road, newcomers to Hong Kong found Queen's Road as a pocked dirt path that was prone to dust clouds and puddles of mud. = The Great Fire of Hong Kong 1878 = On Christmas Day 1878, a fire broke out and destroyed a large area of the slums along Queen's Road. An eyewitness account was recorded by Constance Gordon- Cumming in her 1886 book Wanderings in China.Constance Gordon-Cumming, Wanderings in China (1886), at archive.org The fire raged for 17 hours and burnt down 400 houses across a area. Thousands of residents were left homeless. Nevertheless, the devastated ruins were recycled for reclamation adjacent to the area (modern-day Bonham Strand). After the Great Fire of 1878, Queen's Road become home to some of Hong Kong's most expensive land and famous buildings. Roads Queen's Road West near Sai Ying Pun Central Market. Queen's Road Central in the late 19th century. Hopewell Centre on the left. =Queen's Road West= Queen's Road West (ÁöáÂêéÂ§ßÈÅìË•ø) runs from Sheung Wan to Shek Tong Tsui. It begins in Sheung Wan at the junction with Possession Street and ends where it meets the coastal road, Kennedy Town Praya. =Queen's Road Central= Queen's Road Central (ÁöáÂêéÂ§ßÈÅì‰∏≠) runs from Central to Sheung Wan. It was one of the first roads, along with Hollywood Road to be built by the British. The road became an important infrastructure to Queen's Town, which was later renamed the City of Victoria. Queen's Road Central intersects with the similarly named Queen Victoria Street, a short street perpendicular to the road and leads to a few blocks away from the International Finance Centre. At the western end of Queen's Road Central, the name changes to Queen's Road West. At the eastern end, it merges with Des Voeux Road Central to become Queensway at the junction of Garden Road. When Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese Empire from 1942 to 1945, Queen's Road Central was briefly renamed Meiji-dori, after Emperor Meiji, by the Japanese occupation government. =Queensway= Queensway was originally the westernmost section of Queen's Road East. After the development of Admiralty as a business district next to Central, this section was renamed Queensway (ÈáëÈêòÈÅì) in 1967. It links Queen's Road Central to Queen's Road East and Hennessy Road. =Queen's Road East= Queen's Road East (ÁöáÂêéÂ§ßÈÅìÊù±) runs between Wan Chai and Happy Valley. At the western end, Queen's Road East starts at a fork junction with Queensway and Hennessy Road near Justice Drive. Although situated inland and south of five trunk routes (Gloucester Road, Jaffe Road, Lockhart Road, Hennessy Road and Johnston Road) from the Victoria Harbour, Queen's Road East runs along the old, original shoreline of Hong Kong Island. In pop culture Queen's Road has become an icon of the British Crown colony of Hong Kong. During the transition period before sovereignty transfer, there were rumours that all streets and roads named after the British and Commonwealth colonial figures, such as Queen's Road, would be renamed in honour of the Chinese communists. Lo Ta-yu, a local songwriter, and Albert Leung have therefore composed Queen's Road East in 1991. This song was performed by the songwriter himself and Ram Cheung Chi Kwong (Ëî£ÂøóÂÖâ) in 1991, to describe their fear of change once the communists have taken over. In the uber classic 1941 crime noir movie, \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", Humphrey Bogart's character (Sam Spade) looks into Mary Astor's character's (Brigid O' Shaughnessy) hat, there was a maker's label that read; \\"Lucille Shop ‚Äì Queen's Road C Hong Kong\\".

The temple was probably built in 1847 and may have existed previously as a shrine.Brief Information on Proposed Grade I Items, pp.207‚Äì208 Originally built next to the shoreline, facing the sea, it is now surrounded by clusters of residential and commercial buildings, as the consequence of successive land reclamation.Welcome to 18 districts ‚Äì Wan Chai District Queen's Road East was first developed into a European commercial and residential centre after the arrival of the British in 1841. It had become a mainly Chinese residential, labouring and shop-keeping community by the 1860s. The eastern part of the road was cut through Morrison Hill, which formerly separated Wanchai from Happy Valley. This section was known as 'Gap Road'. That name was still in use around 1930, even though the high land to the north of the 'gap' was levelled in the 1920s and the materials used to reclaim land from the harbour, under the Praya East Reclamation Scheme.Gwulo ‚Äì c.1930 Funeral procession along Gap Road Although associated with Queen's Road Central and Queen's Road West, the name 'Queen's Road East' has been in use since at least the 1870s.Letter from J.

On September 24, 1998, a protest against the series was held outside Paramount Studios. Five days later, UPN released a statement regarding the controversy and stated that the network planned on delaying the controversial pilot episode (which never aired) and would instead air an alternate episode in its place.

The defense of prohibition was a major factor in the establishment of the second Ku Klux Klan (\\"Klan of the 1920s\\") in 1915. He vocally defended the Klan during a congressional probe into their activities saying: \\"that he felt a sort of wounded pride in hearing the many criticisms hurled at the Klan, which was organized in his district and whose imperial wizard is one of the Knightliest, most patriotic men I have ever known.\\"Coffeeville Marshall He suggested investigating all secret societies such as the Masons, etc. which may have contributed to the early conclusion of the probe.

(See William David Upshaw Correspondence file, Bob Jones University Archives, Mack Library.) In 1932, he was the Prohibition Party candidate for the President of the United States with Frank S. Regan of Illinois as his running mate. The ticket came in fifth, losing to Franklin D.

Her backstory is told in Villain Mini-series #5: as a young girl, Karai found the Ashi no Himitsu, a book detailing the secret history of the Foot Clan, in the library of her father, Oroku Yori. From there, she began to learn about the history of her ancestors in the Foot Clan and used the detailed martial arts instructions to train in the clan's unique style of ninjutsu. One night, she had a vision where Oroku Saki appeared and guided her to rebuild the Foot Clan. Having killed her own father, Karai reverted the Foot from a business enterprise to a clan of ninja warriors, training and recruiting new soldiers. Karai assisted in Oroku Saki's resurrection and remained as Chunin (second-in- command) of the clan, until Saki brainwashed Leonardo to join him, displacing Karai. Karai, in her jealousy, begins to secretly recruit for the Foot, including the creation of Bebop and Rocksteady to earn Saki's trust. After the Turtles recover Leonardo, Shredder praises her for her actions and loyalty and reinstates her as Chunin. Later, Shredder sends her to steal more resources from Krang and uses that to create Koya and Bludgeon: a mutant hawk and hammerhead shark. After Splinter kills Shredder in issue #50, Karai offers him her sword and the role of jonin (leader) of the Foot. He accepts and gives Karai permission to travel to Japan with select soldiers to study history in order to attain honor for the Foot. She gets involved in a turf war between two Yakuza clans and is nudged by one of their leaders into embarking on a quest to recover the Kira no Ken, an ancient sword imbued with mystical powers. When she learns that she was betrayed by him, Karai ends up taking over the entire Tokyo underworld. Under the baleful influence of the sword, she starts a vicious turf war with Splinter and the original Foot Clan, critically stabbing Splinter's faithful lieutenant Jennika when she refuses to switch sides.

However, regardless of her unfeeling and slightly negative attitude, she does have a sense of morality and honor, and believes in taking less aggressive measures toward the Turtles and other certain threats. She expressed guilt in taking advantage of the Turtles' trust and controlling them for the benefit of her adopted father who was gradually recuperating. Her feelings of guilt and regret sometimes showed when she dueled Leonardo. Karai believes in staying in the heat of battle until seeing things through and does not fear death. She cares about the human race, as she was against the destruction of the millions of innocence that would have occurred had the floating city of Beijing came crashing down on Earth. Skills and abilities Karai was trained during her adolescence in ninjutsu and high-level forms of hand-to-hand combat under the tutelage of her adopted father, \\"Oroku Saki.\\" Her weapons include a katana, a tanto knife, several shuriken, and a long chain-like weapon. At one point, in her youth, she had demonstrated proficient use of the shortbow and arrow. Having raised by the ruthless and vicious Utrom Shredder, Karai has natural leadership skills and was capable of taking full charge of the Foot clan after the exile of her adopted father and master once she donned his mantle to carry on his destructive and murderous legacy, which seemed to have further multiplied her natural fighting skills. In the Back to the Sewer season, it is implied that she may have trained even higher levels of ninjitsu from Khan, as her redesigned appearance dons a uniform similar to those of his mind-controlled students, as seen in \\"Karate Schooled\\". =2012 animated series= Another iteration of the character appears in Nickelodeon's 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series, where she is voiced by Kelly Hu. Nickelodeon published early character design sketches of their interpretation of Karai on the Internet. In the series, Karai is a 16-year-old teenager and rebellious member of The Foot and a master kunoichi with strong ties to the Shredder.Eric Goldman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Karai is Here and She's Ready to Fight!: Kelly Hu voices the oh-so dangerous Kunoichi., IGN, January 30, 2012 According to the company's official description, \\"as lethal as she is beautiful, Karai brings a whole new level of chaos and complication for the Turtles.\\" Executive producer Ciro Nieli said: \\"I really like what we're doing with Karai the most. I mean, I know she's been part of the universe before but I think the twists and turns we're doing with her and just watching her evolve as a very key player in a series is really exciting. We're not really interested in the old Karai canon so much.\\" The Shredder's voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson said: \\"The daughter thing in my opinion to me that is Shredder's sense of humanity for Shredder. And it's the closest thing to a soft spot. But he doesn't treat her like your average daddy's little girl. He's pretty tough. But at the same time, Shredder with his attachment to her that is the only thing he really has that of course we've never really seen.\\" Karai's voice actress Kelly Hu has only learned later \\"about her and the different versions\\" from reading the TMNT wiki. She said that she \\"was pleasantly surprised at how edgy and cool she was -- and skinny!\\"Eric Goldman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Kelly Hu Discusses Karai's Introduction  The actress on her TMNT role and her ongoing animated career., IGN, February 1, 2013. and added: \\"I love the way she looks. I do not recall if I had a picture before I started. You know, it is really just my own voice though. I try pitching it up a bit to sound younger like more around 20.\\" Hu also said that since she has never seen any other version of Karai, she has nothing to compare her to \\"which is kind of a good thing, because then I just get to play her as I see her myself. But she's sort of feisty, badass and kicks butt. She gets to have a little going on with Leonardo. What I like about playing this character is she's not all bad. She has a conscience that she has to wrestle with ... But see, I don't know about the other Karais or storylines in other series, so I don't know how it matches up, if it's the same or different or what.\\" Asked about what she thinks \\"makes Karai such a popular and unique character,\\" Hu answered: \\"I think people love these little tough girls. She's got lots of attitude and she's sarcastic at times. You just never know what she's going to do. She's always surprising you ‚Äì you think she's going to turn one way and she goes the other.\\" Storyline This version of Karai was introduced in Episode 15, \\"New Girl in Town\\", which had aired on February 1, 2013. She used her cunning tactics to coerce Leonardo into shouldering less responsibility and live his own life. Wanting to see him at midnight, she showed him the mythical sword of Miyamoto Musashi and expressed a desire to have him steal with her. When he refused, she became \\"bored\\", saying how doing such dishonorable things were \\"fun\\". She then left him to fend off Snakeweed, but not before throwing her tanto knife near his head which allowed the Turtle leader to break free. She had made her second appearance in \\"The Alien Agenda\\", where she first encountered the inter-dimensional aliens known as the Kraang. Curious about these extraterrestrials and their involvement with the Turtles, Karai had followed to retrieve an inactive Kraangdroid which she demonstrated to the Shredder and Baxter Stockman, thinking that the scientist could make use of such complex technology from space. Shredder then ordered her to learn more about the Kraang, as their highly advanced technology would prove quite useful in their centuries-old feud with Splinter and the Turtles. In the Season 1 finale, \\"Showdown, Part 2\\" it is revealed that Karai is, in fact, Miwa, the only child and supposedly deceased infant daughter of Hamato Yoshi and his late wife Tang Shen, who was abducted by Shredder as an infant after the battle that resulted in Tang Shen's unfortunate demise fifteen years ago. The Shredder has since raised her as his own, renaming her \\"Karai\\" and telling her that Splinter was responsible for her mother's death. Turning to a shocked and shaken Splinter, she turned to strike him down in retaliation for \\"taking her mother's life.\\" When he refused to battle her, she furiously voiced his cowardice. Karai reappears in the second season's third episode,'\\"Follow the Leader\\". She becomes very interested in the Turtles hunt for the dozens of mutagen canisters scattered across NYC and forms a plan to trap them. She is later seen looking at a torn photograph of her late mother when she is ambushed the new Footbots, a latest invention of the Kraang for Oroku Saki. Although overpowered by their impressive fighting techniques, Shredder emerges to inform her that he is leaving for Japan to take care of \\"urgent business.\\" He warns her not to make any moves against the Turtles until his return to New York, that obedience comes with a stiff penalty. In the two-part episode \\"The Manhattan Project\\", Leo tells Karai the truth that Splinter is her biological father, but she dismisses it as a lie. In \\"The Wrath of Tiger Claw\\", she begins to have doubts towards whether or not Shredder is telling the truth. She \\"lies\\" to Leonardo, saying that she believed she is Splinter's daughter so that way she can go to the Turtles‚Äô Lair to investigate to see if the Turtles are telling the truth and contacts Tiger Claw just in case if she needs backup, but when she found out that she really was Splinter's child, she regretted her past actions and for contacting Tiger Claw and tried to make up for them by helping the Turtles fight Tiger Claw. She is overpowered and taken back to Shredder, who imprisoned her now that she knew the truth about her parentage and true clan. Karai made a nonspeaking cameo in \\"The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto\\" when she was visited by Shredder who tried to explain that it would have been wrong for her to be raised by \\"scum like Splinter\\" and that he had done only what he had to do, what he knew was right. She turned away from her \\"father\\", refusing to even acknowledge his presence. Once he had left, she began hacking away at the bars of her prison cell, determined to escape. In \\"Vengeance is Mine\\", Karai is rescued by the Turtles and brought back to the lair. However, after hearing the story of their rivalry and her mother's death from her biological father, she got so angry that she returned to Shredder's lair to put an end to him once and for all, only to be captured once more. Shredder's real plan was to use her as bait to mutate the Turtles into snakes - reasoning that, as the natural enemy of the rat, the mutated turtle-snakes would then eat Splinter, who would be unable to fight his sons - but he accidentally causes Karai to fall into the mutagen, turning her into a mutant snake that goes on a rampage before escaping as she regains control of herself when about to kill Splinter. Although Donatello hopes to create a retro-mutagen to cure Karai, it is revealed that she is a special kind of mutant and can almost completely change back to her human self, retaining only her greenish snake eyes, venomous fangs, and prehensile tongue. In the second season's two-part finale, \\"The Invasion\\", Karai had two non-speaking cameos; where she appeared near an alley way to hide from the Kraang, and at the end when she had rescued her biological father from drowning to the death in the sewer. She checked his vital organs and warmly nudged him before taking off in the sewers. She also appeared in a flashback when Shredder was reminiscing her training as a young girl, to her unintentional mutation into a mindless purple-and-white snake. She was shown saving Splinter from drowning in a drain pipe. She had brought him to shore, and checked his vital signs before returning to the waters of the sewer. In third season's tenth episode \\"Serpent Hunt\\", Karai is chased by Anton Zeck, Ivan Steranko, Rahzar, and Fishface to be taken to Shredder, who intends to have \\"his daughter\\" back, only under his complete control. Donatello observes that her mind is becoming more snake-like as time goes on, as she can hardly even speak, but she still acknowledged her former enemies as friends and said goodbye to them before departing into the city. She is captured and given to Shredder, who has Baxter begin to work on a mind control serum to get Karai back on his side. In \\"The Deadly Venom\\", not only has Baxter successfully helped Karai control her mutation (allowing her to remain in human form but shape-shift her arms into snakes, as well as infect her enemies with various toxins, poisons and acidic venom), but he also brainwashes her into working for and obeying the Shredder once again, forcing her to call him \\"Father\\" against her will. She is forced to hunt down the Turtles, and their trusted human allies (April O'Neil and Casey Jones) to ultimately get to Splinter. After infecting April, Casey, Mikey and Raphael with her incurably lethal snake's venom, she faced Leonardo; one-on-one who had managed to counteract her lethal venom by utilizing his newly developed healing gifts of \\"the healing hands\\" mantra Splinter had taught him earlier. Although defeated, she managed to escape while Leonardo was distracted. Many nights later, in \\"Attack of the Mega Shredder\\", Karai is seen connected to a Kraang-like contraction that injects her brain with multiple brain-worms. She again staged a plan to capture the Turtles' and place in four separate traps. This would then force Splinter to fight her to the bitter end for his sons' lives. Fortunately, Splinter later used his \\"healing hand\\" mantra, which weakened the brain-worm inside her head, causing her to spit it out, therefore restoring her free will. Although the Turtles' searched long and hard, she had fled from the city of New York; presumably back to Japan. Many months later, Karai is later used by Splinter and April as a motivation for the Shredder to aid in fending off the Triceraton invasion in season three's two-part finale \\"Annihilation: Earth!\\", but Shredder ultimately betrays and kills Splinter anyway in cold blood. Karai is then killed off-screen with the Earth's destruction, but she is saved when the Ninja Turtles create a brand-new timeline in \\"Earth's Last Stand\\". Finally free of the vile brain-worm that had controlled her, a furious Karai focuses all her efforts on taking down Oroku Saki and his criminal empire with the help of her old friend Shinigami; a Shinto witch who possesses extraordinarily powerful dark magic. To give more thought to her new drive, new Foot soldiers are recruited for her own army which she herself commands. Unfortunately, she is later captured by the Shredder (who has now become an unusually strong bladed, muscular mutant himself) and used as a leverage to force Splinter into another duel to the death. Suspended in chains, Karai is forced to watch as her one true father is constantly pulverized by the Super Shredder's immense strength. She manages to use her mutant-snake abilities to break free of her restraints and joins up with April and the Turtles but are blocked by several Chrome Domes. Later, Karai runs off with April and the Turtles to the Undercity and is horrified to see her father, Splinter, barely holding his own against Super Shredder. Before she can rush to her father's aid, more Chrome Domes attack and she watches in horror as Splinter and Oroku Saki fall 1,000 feet; presumably to their deaths. Karai then joins with Leonardo and April, to attract Oroku Saki to the surface. Ambushed by Tiger Claw, she defends April and comes to assist Leonardo, who is being torn apart by Super Shredder. She brutally attacks him with her tanto. She is almost crushed to death by a truck but is saved by April's strong telekinesis. She distracts Saki by \\"offering him the chance of redemption\\" without the need for vengeance, which was merely a ruse for a badly injured Leonardo to escape. She then took advantage of the Super Shredder's distraction to attack him directly by punching his pulsating mutated heart. She abandoned the chase to help April get Leonardo back for medical attention. Some weeks later, Karai is shown to be working with the Mighty Mutanimals to plan her next move. She is shocked when they are interrupted by the sudden arrival of Super Shredder himself. She furiously attempts to attack him with her tanto sword but is blasted backward by his spiked mutated arm, is seriously hurt and knocked unconsciousness by the burning debris. She is saved by Leonardo (who desperately performed CPR to save her from more smoke inhalation) and is taken to the hospital by Shinigami. She eventually regains consciousness in a hospital bed, and is shown to be wearing a neck brace; attached to a life-support machine. The Turtles' sadly inform her of the death of her father and theirs at the spiked hands of Super Shredder. She weakly tells Leonardo to put an end to all of this, and that she will always believe in him. She is later shown next to Leonardo on the building of Stockman Industries with a broken arm. She Leonardo that there is nothing for him to apologize for, and thanks him for doing what no one else could: Finish off the Shredder. She looks on at the skies, where the spirit of Splinter watches over her and the others with pride. In the fifth and final season (titled \\"Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\"), Karai and her good friend Shinigami were traveling in the dead of night in pursuit of Foot soldiers who had double-crossed her, as they accused her of not being worthy to rule the Foot clan. She was suddenly attacked by a mysterious, masked warrior. She was shocked her to discover that it was, in fact, her old teacher and mentor- Hattori Tatsu. After escaping (thanks to Shinigami's dark arts) she came to the Lair to warn the Turtles of Tatsu's desire to rule as the new Shredder, with the mutated, legendary Kuro Kabuto itself in his possession. She is angered and horrified when told that Tiger Claw and his Foot cult is seeking the Kabuto to return Oroku Saki to life. She resolved for them all to find Tatsu and take him down while recovering the Kuro Kabuto, as it is the key that gives its wearer full control over the entire Foot clan. With Leonardo to back her up, Karai appeared at the warehouse where the Kabuto laid and sneaked up behind Tatsu, ready to strike the swordsman down. However, her gambit proved foolish, as her old teacher sensed her presence and beat her again with little effort. In a fury, she knocked off his silver mask, revealing him to be blind. With Leonardo's aid, she was capable of putting him off guard and severely bite him with her snake fangs; thus infecting him with her lethal venom as well. She then turned to the Foot soldiers, stating that Tatsu had been merely using them and tarnishing the name of the Foot clan for his own glory, just as the Shredder had; that the Foot Clan deserves a noble destiny, one with honor and morality. In \\"Heart of Evil\\", Karai later worked alongside April who were pursuing Bebop on a motorbike. When the bike was destroyed by the mutant- warthog's purple energy whips, she was saved from sustaining any injury via April's strong telekinetic abilities. She then fought Kavaxas by even turning full snake and managed to gain the mystical Seal of the Ancients from him for a short time. Some nights later, in \\"End Times\\", Karai aided her April and the Turtles in recovering the fragments of Shredder's heart. She road with April on a motorcycle in pursuit of Bebop. When they were seen, she was saved from falling hard by April's incredibly strong telekinesis. Despite her best efforts, she was not able to stop the heart of her adopted \\"father\\" from falling into the hands of Tiger Claw and Kavaxas. She eventually shows up at the Lair riding on Leatherhead's back. She then went with Leonardo, Michelangelo and Leatherhead to stop Kavaxas and the revived, zombie-like Super Shredder. She watched as the two were dragged into the Netherworld via a mystic portal. As the sunset, she bed a final farewell to her father's spirit in the form a warm and loving hug. She wanted to appreciate the beautiful sunset with Leonardo and the others before going home. In the two-part episode \\"When Worlds Collide\\", Karai seems to remain with the Turtles and her good friend April O'Neil in the Lair, where she frequently spars with Leonardo, whom she expressed her mutual romantic feelings for during their \\"playful\\" training sessions. She waited on the rooftops as the two Salamandrians arrived, and was obviously repulsed that Raphael had a thing for \\"a big newt.\\" She agreed to work together with them to stop the Newtralizer from wiping out the Utroms. When the extraterrestrial bug Lord Dregg invaded, Karai was shocked at Leonardo's capture. She tried to hold off the hordes of Vreen, but was eventually taken to Dregg's spaceship as well. Once released, she fought alongside Leonardo, Donatello and April against Lord Dregg, but was easily beaten. Upon the destruction of the Newtralizer via electrocution, she expressed sadness when Michelangelo offered to use his temporarily acquired electric-generating abilities to buy her and the Turtles enough time to abandon ship; seemingly sacrificing his own life in the process. When Michelangelo reappeared unscathed, Karai assured him that today was a win and that they should celebrate. She expressed her exasperation when Raphael and Mona Lisa shared a loving hug. In \\"The Frankenstein Experiment\\" Karai briefly appeared in an illusion that the mummified Pharaoh had cast to torment Leonardo, as a vampire with the Super Shredder behind her, which gravely worried the Turtle leader. In \\"The Foot Walks Again\\" and \\"The Big Blowout\\" Karai returns, along with her good friend Shinigami, and confronts the much less intimidating Shredder from the 2D world of the '80s‚Äì90s Ninja Turtles. She joins up with her allies April and Casey, and later the Ninja Turtles, their 1980s counterparts and the Mighty Mutanimals, to stop the present Bebop and Rocksteady from working with Krang and Shredder to rip apart both dimensions. Personality Karai is serious, willful and high-spirited and wants to do things her own way but she's also fun loving and at some times bitterly sarcastic. She strongly believes in what she thinks is right and just. However, she also likes taking advantage of those that would benefit her or Shredder in the end. She even believes in stopping those who would make the centuries-old feud between the Foot and Hamato clans seem pointless, like when she opted to fight the Kraang to stop their inevitable invasion of the world. She also had the courage to defy her adoptive father's orders and act on her own, with no fear of the unfortunate consequences. Upon discovering the hard truth about her parentage and true heritage as a blood member of the Hamato Clan, she furiously disowned Oroku Saki as her father and attempted to escape his lair to return to her biological father. She then began to warm up more and grow closer to the Turtles; especially Leonardo. When she had learned the true tragic tale of her mother's untimely demise from Splinter, she wanted revenge on the Shredder so much that she fearlessly ran off to confront him. When she was brainwashed by Shredder's mind-controlling brain-worms, she was sadistic and merciless toward her victims. Once she was finally released of the Shredder's control over her and regained her free will, she furiously dedicated her life to putting an end to Oroku Saki and his criminal empire over the Foot clan; piece by piece, even if it resulted in hurting those dear to her in the process. She soon realized the unintended consequences of her vengeful actions and decided to after the Shredder himself; therefore putting herself in even more danger. Skills and abilities Karai is still highly trained in high leveled moves in ninjitsu and hand-to-hand combat ever since she was a girl. Her weapons are a tanto knife (which symbolizes her higher rank as a full-fledged kunoichi of the Foot clan) and several shuriken. Her natural fighting skills make her incredibly agile in battle, even equal to Leonardo's high skill level. Unlike her 2003 series counterpart, the CGI version of Karai (or rather Miwa, the only child of Hamoato Yoshi and the late Tang Shen) eventually gets inadvertently mutated into a semi-mindless purple- and-white snake. However, due to a small addition of human DNA included, she is able to transform back to her human form for short periods, retaining snake fangs, prehensile tongue and extended serpentine arms. Her face even had scaly parts and her eyes had remained a greenish color instead of their normal brown. Her snake form grants her several abilities attributed to her type of snake; such as further increasing her hearing, speed, agility, endurance, stealth and flexibility to superhuman levels, even giving her greater eyesight and night vision. It comes at a price though, as Karai gets really feral in her snake form and is barely able to speak or act rationally. In addition she is frequently seen screaming before changing from her snake side into her human side as the change itself is very painful to endure, which is also why Karai very seldom goes to full snake unless there's no other option. In addition, Miwa/Karai can infect her victims with extremely lethal poisons and highly toxic venom that is quite fatal in a matter of hours, capable of seeping through skin in seconds. They have no antidote but can be counteracted with the ancient healing arts of \\"the healing hands\\" mantras. When she was recaptured by the Foot, Stockman Fly had used his scientific intellect to give her complete control over snake form, allowing her to appear fully human without any noticeable snake traits, and even turn full snake at will. When used in conjunction with her highly extensive ninjitsu skills, her snake abilities makes her quite a formidable opponent. Some time later, she learned how to use her snakelike abilities to heal severe injuries she has sustained (such as burns or bruises) by simply shedding her damaged skin and replacing it with brand-new skin, similar to how a snake sheds its skin.

Aided by April and Casey, she then leads her ninja in retrieving the last of the monsters. In the end, Karai parts ways with the Turtles peacefully, but gives a cryptic last word that Turtles \\"have passed\\" something (she refuses to elaborate) and \\"soon we will have further business together; the kind that involves familiar faces from your past\\", implying on the Shredder's inevitable return to life. *Karai from the 2003 animated series appears in the 2009 special Turtles Forever, in which she frees Ch'rell from the clutches of the 1987 series' Shredder, Krang, and Bebop & Rocksteady.

Ishibashi, a self-proclaimed \\"fangirl\\" of Karai, auditioned for the role code-named \\"Female Soldier\\", correctly predicting it would be Karai. Ishibashi said, \\"My version of Karai is a soldier first. She is Shredder's right hand and will do whatever it takes to get the job done. She's fiercely loyal, smart, and a warrior when it comes to honoring the task at hand.

Preparing for the role, she trained with the stunt team 87Eleven, in addition to her black belt in taekwondo, and also had two stunt doubles, Natalie Padilla and Ming Qiu. In the first film, Karai is depicted as Shredder's assistant who leads many of the Foot Clan's field missions. Karai is seen many times accompanying Eric Sacks and Shredder. Karai is last seen in a car chase with the Turtles where Raphael causes her jeep to crash into a tree. In the sequel, she is still Shredder's right-hand woman, acting as both a bodyguard and assistant. She also works closely with Baxter Stockman.

The brown areas represent hemosiderin Hemosiderin or haemosiderin is an iron-storage complex. The breakdown of heme gives rise to biliverdin and iron. The body then traps the released iron and stores it as hemosiderin in tissues. Hemosiderin is also generated from the abnormal metabolic pathway of ferritin. It is only found within cells (as opposed to circulating in blood) and appears to be a complex of ferritin, denatured ferritin and other material. The iron within deposits of hemosiderin is very poorly available to supply iron when needed. Hemosiderin can be identified histologically with Perls' Prussian blue stain; iron in hemosiderin turns blue to black when exposed to potassium ferrocyanide. In normal animals, hemosiderin deposits are small and commonly inapparent without special stains. Excessive accumulation of hemosiderin is usually detected within cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) or occasionally within epithelial cells of liver and kidney. Several disease processes result in deposition of larger amounts of hemosiderin in tissues; although these deposits often cause no symptoms, they can lead to organ damage. Hemosiderin is most commonly found in macrophages and is especially abundant in situations following hemorrhage, suggesting that its formation may be related to phagocytosis of red blood cells and hemoglobin. Hemosiderin can accumulate in different organs in various diseases. Iron is required by many of the chemical reactions (i.e., oxidation-reduction reactions) in the body but is toxic when not properly contained. Thus, many methods of iron storage have developed. Pathophysiology Hemosiderin often forms after bleeding (haemorrhage). When blood leaves a ruptured blood vessel, the red blood cell dies, and the hemoglobin of the cell is released into the extracellular space. Phagocytic cells (of the mononuclear phagocyte system) called macrophages engulf (phagocytose) the hemoglobin to degrade it, producing hemosiderin and biliverdin. Excessive systemic accumulations of hemosiderin may occur in macrophages in the liver, lungs, spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. These accumulations may be caused by excessive red blood cell destruction (haemolysis), excessive iron uptake/hyperferraemia, or decreased iron utilization (e.g., anaemia of copper toxicity) uptake hypoferraemia (which often leads to iron deficiency anemia). Diseases associated with hemosiderin deposition Hemosiderin may deposit in diseases associated with iron overload. These diseases are typically diseases in which chronic blood loss requires frequent blood transfusions, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.

History Sinnock was the designer of the Roosevelt dime and Franklin half dollar, among other U.S. coins. His initials can be found at the base of the Roosevelt and Franklin busts. He also sculpted, although did not design, the Purple Heart medal, the Yangtze Service Medal, and various other medals and commemorative coins. Sinnock was born July 8, 1888, in Raton, New Mexico, and was educated at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art. He won the A.W. Mifflin Award for study abroad. Sinnock was well-traveled. His longtime confidant was Margaret Campbell who inherited much of his artwork as well as his personal collection of materials related to the development of the Roosevelt Dime. For ten years Sinnock was an art instructor at both his alma mater and at Western Reserve University. He was appointed Assistant Engraver and Medallist at the Philadelphia Mint in 1917 before becoming the Chief Engraver in 1925. Controversies Upon the initial minting of the Roosevelt dime in 1946, a false narrative arose in the United States that the letters \\"JS\\" actually stood not for John Sinnock, but for Joseph Stalin. The urban folk story coincided with the Second Red Scare. The rumor surfaced again after the release of the Sinnock designed Franklin half dollar in 1948. Another controversy that surrounded the Roosevelt dime following its public release was an allegation that Sinnock copied or borrowed the design of the President's profile from a bronze bas relief created by sculptress Selma H. Burke for the dime's obverse. Sinnock denied this claim and said that the obverse portrait of the President was a composite of two studies which he made from life in 1933 and 1934. Sinnock said that he also consulted photographs of FDR and had the advice and criticism of two prominent sculptors who specialize in work in relief.

The MSC is used by many mathematics journals, which ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The current version is MSC2020.  Structure  The MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used. The first level is represented by a two-digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two-digit number. For example: * 53 is the classification for differential geometry * 53A is the classification for classical differential geometry * 53A45 is the classification for vector and tensor analysis = First level = At the top level, 64 mathematical disciplines are labeled with a unique two-digit number. In addition to the typical areas of mathematical research, there are top-level categories for \\"History and Biography\\", \\"Mathematics Education\\", and for the overlap with different sciences. Physics (i.e. mathematical physics) is particularly well represented in the classification scheme with a number of different categories including: * Fluid mechanics * Quantum mechanics * Geophysics * Optics and electromagnetic theory All valid MSC classification codes must have at least the first-level identifier. = Second level = The second-level codes are a single letter from the Latin alphabet. These represent specific areas covered by the first-level discipline. The second-level codes vary from discipline to discipline. For example, for differential geometry, the top-level code is 53, and the second-level codes are: * A for classical differential geometry * B for local differential geometry * C for global differential geometry * D for symplectic geometry and contact geometry In addition, the special second-level code \\"-\\" is used for specific kinds of materials. These codes are of the form: * 53-00 General reference works (handbooks, dictionaries, bibliographies, etc.) * 53-01 Instructional exposition (textbooks, tutorial papers, etc.) * 53-02 Research exposition (monographs, survey articles) * 53-03 Historical (must also be assigned at least one classification number from Section 01) * 53-04 Explicit machine computation and programs (not the theory of computation or programming) * 53-06 Proceedings, conferences, collections, etc. The second and third level of these codes are always the same - only the first level changes. For example, it is not valid to use 53- as a classification. Either 53 on its own or, better yet, a more specific code should be used. = Third level = Third-level codes are the most specific, usually corresponding to a specific kind of mathematical object or a well-known problem or research area. The third-level code 99 exists in every category and means none of the above, but in this section.  Using the scheme  The AMS recommends that papers submitted to its journals for publication have one primary classification and one or more optional secondary classifications. A typical MSC subject class line on a research paper looks like MSC Primary 03C90; Secondary 03-02; History According to the American Mathematical Society (AMS) help page about MSC,MR: Help: MSC Primary the MSC has been revised a number of times since 1940. Based on a scheme to organize AMS's Mathematical Offprint Service (MOS scheme), the AMS Classification was established for the classification of reviews in Mathematical Reviews in the 1960s. It saw various ad-hoc changes. Despite its shortcomings, Zentralblatt f√ºr Mathematik started to use it as well in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, a jointly revised scheme with more formal rules was agreed upon by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt f√ºr Mathematik under the new name Mathematics Subject Classification. It saw various revisions as MSC1990, MSC2000 and MSC2010.Bernd Wegner. Indexierung mathematischer Literatur Die Revision der Mathematics Subject Classification MSC. Institute of Mathematics, TU Berlin. http://fidmath.de/fileadmin/download/graz_wegner.ppt In July 2016, Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH started collecting input from the mathematical community on the next revision of MSCAnnouncement of the plan to revise the Mathematics Subject Classification, which was released as MSC2020 in January 2020.MSC2020 available now The original classification of older items has not been changed. This can sometimes make it difficult to search for older works dealing with particular topics. Changes at the first level involved the subjects with (present) codes 03, 08, 12-20, 28, 37, 51, 58, 74, 90, 91, 92.  Relation to other classification schemes  For physics papers the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) is often used. Due to the large overlap between mathematics and physics research it is quite common to see both PACS and MSC codes on research papers, particularly for multidisciplinary journals and repositories such as the arXiv. The ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) is a similar hierarchical classification scheme for computer science. There is some overlap between the AMS and ACM classification schemes, in subjects related to both mathematics and computer science, however the two schemes differ in the details of their organization of those topics. The classification scheme used on the arXiv is chosen to reflect the papers submitted. As arXiv is multidisciplinary its classification scheme does not fit entirely with the MSC, ACM or PACS classification schemes. It is common to see codes from one or more of these schemes on individual papers.

Origins While affirming the PLO's commitment to fight Israel, the Fatah-sponsored Ten Point Program authorized the PLO to \\"establish [an] independent combatant national authority for the people over every part of Palestinian territory that is liberated\\", which was regarded by many Palestinians as a possible first step towards a two-state proposal. At the same PNC session, the ultimate goal of the PLO was defined as recovering the Palestinian right of return and right of self-determination \\"on the whole of the soil of their homeland\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20110805192136/http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/12354;jsessionid=ED2AC7E70A82F5C7CCB42BC6357FCDEC This prompted several of the more militant Palestinian factions to leave the PLO in protest and form the Rejectionist Front.As'ad AbuKhalil. \\"Internal Contradictions in the PFLP: Decision Making and Policy Orientation.\\" Middle East Journal 41, no. 3 (1987): 361-78. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4327585. They were mostly far-left organizations fearing a Palestinian-Israeli rapprochement. The Front was never an operative organization, but rather a statement of position. It was strongly backed by Iraq. While the involved factions continued to advocate a hard-line policy towards Israel, most of them eventually rejoined the PLO, for example in 1977, when the Steadfastness and Confrontation Front was announced. But tensions remained, and the Rejectionist Front or similar initiatives were revived virtually every time Arafat made a conciliatory gesture towards Israel. The most serious rift was in 1988, when the PLO recognized Israel, and most of the left-wing of the PLO again left, backed by Syria.  Consequences  Though the rift initially caused a popular breakthrough for the members of the Rejectionist Front, in the long run it only marginalized them and caused them to be perceived as lackeys of the Arab states. The fact that it was more of an alignment against Yasser Arafat rather than for anything in particular didn't help, as the Front brought \\"together\\" factions that had no common goal. This can be seen by the example of as-Saiqa, a movement that forms the branch of the pro-Syrian Ba'ath Party in the Palestinian territories, and the Arab Liberation Front, similar however used by the pro-Iraqi Ba'ath Party. The alliance did nothing to improve cooperation between member factions, and internecine bloodshed continued. The Front also failed in its goal of weakening Arafat; the PLO Chairman remained securely at the helm of the organization and consolidated a massive war arsenal and order of battle in southern Lebanon in order to harass the Israelis. The Ten-Point Program increased Arafat's worth on the diplomatic front as more western states became willing to speak with his representatives. The members of the Front, contrastingly, isolated themselves as extremists and subservient to the Arab states that backed them and even to the USSR. In 1975 the Lebanese Civil War broke out. Far bloodier than its 1950s prelude, it featured most PLO factions on the side of the Lebanese National Movement, specially with the mainly Sunni al-Murabitun. The right-wing Lebanese Front had long seen the PLO as a threat to their supremacy in Lebanon's volatile sectarian balance. The Lebanese National Movement and PLO were seen too as a threat to Syria, as they opposed Syrian strategy. As a result, the Rejectionist Front itself became split between the PFLP and various smaller groups which sided with the LNM and Fatah, and as-Saiqa and the PFLP-General Command which sided with Syria. Throughout the late 1970s and then the 1980s the Lebanese wars decimated the ranks of some of the pro-Syrian groups, especially those who supported the Syrians in the War of the Camps. During that war, where the Front was joined by dissidents from within Fatah (Fatah al-Intifada) led by Col. Said al- Muragha, many of them assaulted refugee camps leading to civilian casualties and accusations that they were turncoats concerned only with serving Assad's goals. The PFLP-GC, for example, which was commanded by the professional guerrilla Ahmed Jibril, wasted much of its efforts on fighting Arafat instead of attacking the Israelis in southern Lebanon, or in recruiting a local infrastructure in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. In addition, most of these groups became extremely dependent on the Syrian government financially and for military supplies. It may be that the PFLP and DFLP's neutrality in the War of the Camps saved them from the mediocre fate that led to the irrelevancy held by the PFLP-General Command to this day. Decline and demise The Front also showed obvious divisions in respect to the First Intifada (1987‚Äì91), as well as the Persian Gulf War (1991). In 1991, Palestinian Popular Struggle Front was allowed to rejoin the PLO after accepting United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 and the concept of negotiations with Israel. The Abu Nidal Organization faded continuously into the shadows after 1991, as-Saiqa never grew out of its comfortable niche in the arms of Assad, the ALF did the same under the sponsorship of Saddam Hussein, the DFLP divided in two on the question of the Oslo Accords (1993), while the PFLP began an ambivalent participation in the peace process that never resulted in complete rejection or acceptance. Today, the Rejectionist Front as a whole is overshadowed by the hard-line Islamist groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Resistance Committees, as well as hard-line affiliates of the PLFP and Fatah such as the Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, respectively. Most of the organizations that once belonged to the Front today only have dozens of members.

Presently, it is a short stub between Highway 58 and Niagara Regional Road 70 in the City of Thorold, but until 1997 it connected Hamilton to Niagara Falls, serving several towns atop the Niagara Escarpment en route. Highway 20 was first designated in 1930, serving as a bypass to the congested Highway 8\\\\. Soon after, a new cut was made into the Niagara Escarpment south of Stoney Creek, which would serve Highway 20 for 66 years. However, the new route failed to divert a significant amount of traffic from Highway 8\\\\. Subsequently, the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) was constructed through the Niagara Peninsula between 1937 and 1940. The opening of the Burlington Bay Skyway in 1958 bypassed the routing of Highway 20; it was truncated at the QEW in Stoney Creek in 1964 as a result. The routing remained unchanged between then and 1998, when all but a short stub of the highway was transferred to regional jurisdiction.  Route description  While today Highway 20 is a mere stub of its former length, most of the former route retains the same layout and character as the highway did prior to 1998, serving as the main street of the villages of Fonthill and Smithville. At Allanburg, Highway 20 crosses the Welland Canal utilizing the Allanburg Bridge, or Bridge 11, a vertical lift bridge which opened to traffic in the spring of 1930 shortly after hwy 20 was first opened. The remaining portion of the highway is mostly rural in nature, although numerous motels line the short stretch of roadway, reminiscent of a bygone era. It begins at a signalized intersection with Highway 58, which proceeds north and west from there. Moving eastward, the majority of motels line the south side of the highway, as do several residences and a strip club. At Thorold Townline Road (Regional Road 70), Highway 20 ends while the roadway continues eastward into the city of Niagara Falls as Lundy's Lane. Lundy's Lane is named for William Lundy (1741-1829), a United Empire Loyalist from Berks County Pennsylvania and local settler in the Niagara area and homestead stood where Canada One Outlets now sits. During the 1960s and 1970s, Lundy's Lane attracted a concentration of businesses which catered to automobile travellers and tourists. However, a significant number of these businesses faded away along with the automobile age.  History  Department of Highways constructed the Stoney Creek Cut, providing a low-grade ascent of the Niagara Escarpment. Highway 20 was first designated on March 12, 1930, with its western terminus at the intersection of Highway 8 (Main Street) and Highway 6 (John Street) in downtown Hamilton. It proceeded south along John Street, concurrently with Highway 6, to the foot of the Niagara Escarpment, where the two routes split. Highway 20 climbed the escarpment through the Jolley Cut, while Highway 6 used the Claremont Access. At the top, Highway 20 proceeded east along Concession Street, then south along Upper Gage Avenue to Rymal Road. From there, the route turned east and followed Rymal Road to Elfrida and onwards to its eastern terminus at the Honeymoon Bridge Niagara Falls. Soon thereafter, the Department of Highways (DHO) began to excavate a new cut into the escarpment between Elfrida and Stoney Creek. While under construction in 1931, Highway 20 was rerouted onto what would become known as Centennial Parkway, briefly ending at a junction between Highway 8 and Highway 8A (the present day intersection of Queenston Road and Centennial Parkway); the old routing from Elfrida to downtown Hamilton was renumbered as Highway 20A. The highway descended the escarpment along the now-closed Glover Mountain Road, which connected the modern Greenhill Avenue with First Road. Highway 8A meanwhile, proceeded north from Stoney Creek to Burlington via Burlington Beach; it was renumbered as an extension of Highway 20 when the Stoney Creek Cut was completed in 1932. At the same time, the highway was shifted from Glover Mountain Road to the new Centennial Parkway. Between Welland and Niagara Falls, Highway 3 originally followed the Merrittville Highway (later Highway 58) and Lundy's Lane to the Honeymoon Bridge; Highway 3A connected Port Colborne to Fort Erie. In 1929, the two route numbers were switched, as traffic pattern had shifted to make use of the new Peace Bridge. After Highway 20 was designated, the Highway 3A designation was superseded between Allanburg and Niagara Falls. Between Hamilton and Welland, several major diversions were constructed during the 1930s, including west of Elfrida (the old route followed South Townline Road and Chapel Hill Road), east of Kimbo (the old route now known as Kimbo Road) and around St. Anns (having originally followed Twenty Mile Creek Road and St. Anns Road). In 1938, construction began on a large traffic circle between Highway 20 and the QEW in Stoney Creek and on a cloverleaf with Lundy's Lane in Niagara Falls; both were completed prior to the opening of the QEW on August 23, 1940. Highway 20 was now , its peak length. Both the QEW and Highway 20 crossed the entrance to Hamilton Harbour utilizing a four lane lift bridge. However, this quickly became one of the two major bottlenecks along the new superhighway. By the early-1950s, traffic lineups often stretched for several kilometres each time the bridge raised. This prompted the DHO to construct a skyway over the canal, which opened on October 30, 1958 and provided four lanes of uninterrupted travel. Subsequently, the use of Highway 20 (now Beach Boulevard) for long distance travel ceased. In 1964, the portion of Highway 20 between Burlington and the Stoney Creek Traffic Circle was transferred to Halton County and Wentworth County, reducing its length to . The route remained unchanged until the late 1990s. On January 1, 1998, the province downloaded the majority of the highway to the Regional Municipalities of Hamilton and Niagara. However, a short section remains, connecting Highway 58 to the city boundary of Niagara Falls. It is unclear why this short portion was retained in the provincial highway network.

Bradford Sheppard was an American working as a radio engineer for Hazeltine Electronics during World War II. Sheppard, who worked on radar in the design office, wished to fight Nazi Germany in the armed forces but was turned down by the US Army due to blindness in one eye. He then asked Soviet intelligence to arrange Soviet citizenship for himself and his family so that he could join the Soviet army. When the Soviets made clear he would not be allowed to fight he broke off all contact. Soviet intelligence assigned Sheppard the cover name MASTER or MASTER CRAFTSMAN. After World War II, C. Bradford Sheppard was part of the original Eckert & Mauchly team of electrical engineers which designed and built the first digital computers, notably the ENIAC, EDVAC and UNIVAC machines. In particular he invented some of the first digital delay systems, also known as digital memory, which were based on sending sound waves down a mercury-filled cylinder. C. Bradford Sheppard was one of the teachers in the original Moore School Lectures which were given during the summer of 1946. It is trivial to demonstrate that C. Bradford Sheppard was not a Soviet spy, as the Soviets never held information on the digital computers he helped develop as part of the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation. These allegations were part of the infamous McCarthy campaign and were rebutted by Mauchly himself when a hearing was eventually afforded him.

(Houston, Texas, the current center of the oil industry, more frequently uses the sobriquet ‚ÄúThe Energy Capital of the World.‚Äù) History Oil Capital Historic District in Tulsa In mid-19th century, when Pennsylvania was the first center of petroleum production, Pittsburgh and Titusville were considered oil capitals. In the later 19th century, before oil was discovered in Texas, Oklahoma, or the Middle East, Cleveland, Ohio had a claim to the title, with 86 or 88 refineries operating in the city in 1884. Tulsa claimed the name early in the 20th century, after oil strikes at Red Fork (1901) and Glenpool (1905) in Tulsa County. Many prominent oilmen lived in Tulsa at some point, including Josh Cosden, William Skelly, Harry Ford Sinclair, Waite Phillips, George Kaiser, and J. Paul Getty. Many corporations producing, refining or transporting petroleum had at some point their headquarters or major facilities in Tulsa including Texaco, BP-Amoco, Cities Service Company, Sinclair Oil and Gas Company, Skelly Oil Company, Warren Petroleum Company, the Williams Companies, and Kaiser-Francis Oil Company. In 1923 a group of Tulsa oilmen organized the first International Petroleum Exposition and Congress (IPE); among the IPE's stated purposes was to \\"firmly establish Tulsa for all time to come as the oil center of the entire world.\\" Tulsa continued to be known and promote itself as the \\"oil capital of the world\\" into the 1950s\\"What Happens When LIFE Hits Tulsa?\\", LIFE, December 19, 1955. Excerpt available at Google Books. and 1960s. The IPE grew and reached its peak attendance in 1966, when the Golden Driller, a large statue symbolic of Tulsa's historical importance in the oil industry, was erected in front of the new IPE Building, then said to be the world's largest building under one roof. By the 1970s, however, the IPE's success, and Tulsa's role in the international oil industry, had both eroded: Tulsa's last IPE was held in 1979,\\"International Petroleum Exposition\\" at Oklahoma Historical Society Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (retrieved March 6, 2015). while Houston has become the most prominent hub of the oil industry in the United States. In more recent times, Tulsa's continued use of \\"oil capital of the world\\" is often characterized as nostalgic or historical. But even today, energy is one of Tulsa's major industries, and many of the city‚Äôs professional sports franchises have petroleum-related names such as the Tulsa Oilers (ice hockey), the Tulsa Drillers (baseball), and the Tulsa Roughnecks (now FC Tulsa, men‚Äôs soccer).

Austin (born March 25, 1942) is an American economist who served as the 13th President of the University of Connecticut from October 1, 1996 to September 14, 2007. He returned to serve as interim president in May 2010 following the abrupt departure of Michael J. Hogan. Prior to UConn, Austin served as president of Colorado State University (1984‚Äì1989) and chancellor of the University of Alabama System (1989‚Äì1996). Early life and career Austin was born on March 25, 1942, in Fargo, North Dakota. He attended North Dakota State University, where he earned his B.S. degree in 1964 and his M.S. degree in 1966, both in agricultural economics. He was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He went on to earn a M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from Michigan State University in 1969. Austin served in the United States Army from 1969 through 1971 as an economist stationed at the US military headquarters in Saigon, Vietnam. He attained the rank of captain and received the Bronze Star, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, and the Army Commendation Medal. He subsequently served as an economist in the director‚Äôs office of the US Office of Management and Budget from 1971 to 1974. From 1974 to 1977, he was deputy assistant secretary of education in the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, including a stint as acting assistant secretary of education. He was one of a three-person team invited by the Danish government to evaluate Denmark‚Äôs educational programs and policies. Austin subsequently transitioned to academic administration, serving as director of the interdisciplinary doctoral program in public policy at George Washington University. From 1978 to 1984, he served as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Baruch College. Administrative career = President of Colorado State University = From 1984 to 1989, Austin served as President of Colorado State University and Chancellor of the Colorado State University System, which included Colorado State University‚ÄìPueblo and Fort Lewis College in Durango. He also held the academic rank of Professor in the Department of Economics and the Department of Finance. = Chancellor of the University of Alabama System = From 1989 to 1996, Austin served as Chancellor of the University of Alabama System, which included campuses in Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, and Huntsville. = President of the University of Connecticut = Austin served as the thirteenth President of the University of Connecticut for eleven years, from 1996 to 2007. During Austin‚Äôs tenure, UConn underwent a physical transformation made possible by the state's UConn 2000 and 21st Century UConn infrastructure investment programs, totaling $2.3 billion. While UConn 2000 was already underway when Austin arrived, Austin was instrumental in persuading Governor John G. Rowland and the legislature to add another $1.3 billion for the new 21st Century UConn initiative starting in 2005. Seventy new or renovated buildings reflected the scale of the program. The 21st Century UConn program also funded construction of a new $60 million research tower at UConn Health, which included more than thirty laboratories. Frank Gehry designed the university's $90 million new fine arts complex in Storrs. Although cost overruns and code violations troubled this massive construction campaign, the results were transformative. In 2004, Austin concluded a capital campaign that raised $470 million, significantly higher than its $300 million goal. This unprecedented sum included a $23 million naming gift from Raymond and Carol Neag to the Neag School of Education‚Äîthe largest gift ever made to a public university in New England. Other donations enabled the establishment of fifty-two new endowed chairs and professorships. Notwithstanding these fundraising successes, a planned private-public partnership with Pfizer, which would have led to the construction of a $35 million animal vaccine research facility on the scenic Horsebarn Hill in Storrs, foundered in 1999 in the face of intense opposition from local citizens and environmentalists. Austin dealt with other controversies during his tenure, including notoriously chaotic Spring Weekends that attracted 20,000 drunken revelers, including many non- students, to campus parking lots and off-campus apartment complexes. Academics and athletics also grew under Austin's stewardship. UConn's football program advanced to Division I-A with the construction of the Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, which opened in 2003 in East Hartford. Enrollment grew while the average SAT score of freshmen rose 82 points. Research funding increased from $61 million in 1994 to $92 million in 2004. The University of Connecticut Humanities Institute (UCHI) was founded in 2001. U.S. News & World Report ranked UConn as the top public university in New England and 27th best in the nation. = Other Connecticut leadership roles = In September 2007, Austin resigned his position as President of the University and returned to the faculty. In a December 2006 editorial, the Hartford Courant declared Austin \\"one of the most productive and professional leaders in the university's 125-year history,\\" who led the university \\"from a respected regional institution to a national presence.\\" Following his departure, Austin was recipient of several university honors. The Philip E. Austin Building (formerly the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Building) was named in his honor in 2012. The Philip E. Austin Endowed Chair in public policy at UConn was created in his honor. He was one of only five UConn presidents to be designated a president emeritus. Following his successor Michael Hogan's abrupt departure three years later, Austin returned to serve as UConn's interim president from June 2010 through May 2011. From July 2011 through May 2012, Austin served as UConn Health's interim vice president for health affairs. At the request of Governor Dannel Malloy, Austin served as interim president of the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education from October 2012 through June 2013. Public service Austin chaired the board of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and served as president of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).

Early life and career West was born in Devil's Hollow, Gilmer County, Georgia, the child of North Georgia sharecroppers. In high school he led a protest against an on-campus showing of the film The Birth of a Nation and was eventually expelled for other conflicts. He was also expelled from Lincoln Memorial University, in Harrogate, Tennessee, for leading another protest against the paternalism of the campus, though he eventually returned and graduated in 1929. He went on to study under Alva Taylor and Willard Uphaus at the Vanderbilt Divinity School in Nashville and was influenced by the Social Gospel movement. While a student, he became a Socialist and participated in labor strikes in textile factories and coal mines. Like his eventual collaborator Myles Horton, he travelled to Denmark to tour the Danish folk schools. These were schools that promoted adult education and community engagement. Upon their return, Horton and West co-founded the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee.

Joaqu√≠n Blake y Joyes (V√©lez-M√°laga, 19 August 1759 - 27 April 1827, Valladolid) was a Spanish military officer who served with distinction in the French Revolutionary and Peninsular wars. Early military career Partially of Irish descent his mother was from Galicia and his father an Irishman, Blake was born at V√©lez-M√°laga to an aristocratic family. In his youth, he saw action as a lieutenant of the grenadiers in the American Revolutionary War, taking part in the failed siege of Gibraltar and the 1783 reconquest of Minorca from the British. At the outbreak of war with France in 1793, Blake, a captain, took part in the invasion of Roussillon under General Ricardos. He was wounded at San-Lorenzo- de-la-Muga in 1794. Peninsular War Exploits in the field led to further promotions, and by the start of the Peninsular War in 1808, Blake held the rank of Lieutenant General. He was appointed head of the Supreme Junta's Army of Galicia (a paper force of 43,001 holding the Spanish left wing along the Cantabrian mountains) during the French invasions and fought well against Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e despite the heavy odds against him. Blake and Cuesta were defeated on 14 July at Medina del Rio Seco. Following the general French retreat prompted by the disaster at Bail√©n, Blake took up positions opposite the enemy on the banks of the Ebro. On 31 October Marshal Lefebvre's IV Corps fell upon Blake's 19,000 men at Pancorbo, turning back the hesitant Spanish advance. To his credit, Blake retreated swiftly and in good order, preventing Napoleon's planned envelopment and annihilation of the Spanish flank. Furious, the Emperor dispatched Lefebvre and Victor in pursuit, the latter ordered to outmaneuver Blake and sweep across his line of retreat. The French were careless and allowed their forces to disperse during the pursuit. On 5 November Blake surprised his enemies again when, at Valmaseda, he suddenly turned about and attacked the French vanguard with seasoned troops, inflicting a stinging defeat on General Vilatte's leading division. However, another French corps then joined the chase, and Blake raced west once more to evade encirclement. Blake chose to make another stand at Espinosa on 10 November. Victor, intent on avenging himself for his earlier humiliations at the hands of Blake, spent the day recklessly flinging his divisions against the Spaniards without success. The next day, however, a well-coordinated French attack shattered Blake's center and drove his army from the field in rout. Although Blake lost only 3,001 men on the battlefield, many thousands more were dispersed in the hopeless confusion of retreat as the Spanish front disintegrated. Knowing the Army of Galicia to be irreparably shattered, Blake embarked on a grueling march west into the hills, outdistancing his pursuers under Soult. He reached L√©on on 23 November with only 10,000 men. Command of what remained of the Army of Galicia then passed to General Pedro Caro y Sureda, 3rd marqu√©s de La Romana. =Battle of Albuera= In 1810, Blake participated in the creation of a Spanish General Staff, which in the final years of the war began to restore coherence to the country's military enterprises. Poor battlefield performance had in large part been caused by the lethargy, mismanagement, and miscoordination of Spain's fragmented military administration. On 16 May 1811 Blake fought the French at the Battle of Albuera alongside William Beresford's Anglo-Portuguese army. The Spaniards under Blake's command successfully held the allied flank against a strong French infantry, earning him a promotion to Captain General. Blake was then transferred to eastern Spain to combat Marshal Suchet's advance on Valencia. Blake, after several defeats, ended up trapped in the city with his army, eventually surrendering on 8 January 1812 with his 16,000 troops, which marked the high point of French successes in eastern Spain. Later life In 1815 Blake was made Chief Engineer of the Spanish Royal Army. He died in 1827 in Valladolid, North Western Spain.

It is located on a hill with the ability to bombard ships entering the Thames River. About 100 feet below the main fort is a battery for additional guns which was built during the Revolutionary War and improved in the late 19th century. In September 1781, British troops under Benedict Arnold raided and burned New London. The British were well informed of the layout of Fort Griswold, and Arnold approached the river from such an angle that its guns could not engage his fleet. The British forces divided, some to burn New London and the rest to attack the fort in the Battle of Groton Heights. The British eventually broke into the fort, and Colonel William Ledyard surrendered by handing his sword hilt-first to the commanding British officer‚Äîwho took it and thrust it through Colonel Ledyard. Arnold abandoned the fort soon after and left New London in flames. =Later use= The fort was rebuilt and manned in several other conflicts, but the Battle of Groton Heights was its most prominent use. It was used during the War of 1812 by sailors commanded by Commodore Stephen Decatur when Decatur's three-ship squadron was blockaded by a larger British force in 1814. In the 1840s, the fort's lower battery was rebuilt for 20 guns, initially 32-pounder and 24-pounder cannons. After the American Civil War, the lower battery was redesigned to mount 10-inch Rodman guns. It was a sub-post of Fort Trumbull for most of its use by the Army, although it was never actively garrisoned after the Civil War and had an ordnance sergeant as caretaker. It was in the care of Ordnance Sergeant Mark Wentworth Smith from 1863 to 1879, a Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War veteran who was wounded at the Battle of Chapultepec. Sergeant Smith died in 1879 at age 76, the oldest active duty enlisted soldier in the history of the Army. Fort Griswold became obsolete after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, when Fort H. G. Wright was completed in 1906 on Fishers Island as part of the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound. =State park= The State of Connecticut has owned and operated the site as Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park since 1953. This includes the restored earthwork battery, cannons, and a shot furnace and powder magazine. The grounds include several monuments and memorials to state residents who fought in different wars: * The Groton Monument is a granite obelisk dedicated to the defenders who fell during the Battle of Groton Heights. It was built between 1826 and 1830 and stands tall with 166 steps. * The adjacent Monument House Museum features exhibits about the Revolutionary War and is operated by the Daughters of the American Revolution. Visitors can climb the monument and visit the museum from Memorial Day through Labor Day. *The Ebenezer Avery House sheltered the wounded after the Battle of Groton Heights. It is a Revolutionary-period historic house museum that is open for tours on summer weekends.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1903 until his death as a member of the Conservative Party, and was a prominent cabinet minister in the government of Rodmond Roblin. Agnew was born in Prince Albert, Ontario County, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of Dr. Niven Agnew and Jane Somerville Ross, and was educated at Upper Canada College. Agnew moved to Winnipeg with his family in 1879; he studied law, articling with James Albert Manning Aikins, and was called to the Manitoba bar in 1884. He practised law in Virden, Manitoba. In 1888, he married Anna M. Dickson. Agnew was a school trustee in Virden for over ten years, and was a town councillor for two. In religion, he was a member of the Church of England. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1903 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate F.W. Clinigan by 25 votes in the Virden constituency. He was appointed to Roblin's cabinet on March 2, 1904 as Provincial Treasurer. New cabinet appointees were required to seek a renewed mandate from their electors in this period of Canadian history, and Agnew was returned for Virden without opposition on March 12. He was re-elected with an increased majority in the 1907 election, and was retained as Provincial Treasurer in the legislative sitting that following. He died in office in 1908.

The Positivists extolled science and technology, and popularized slogans of \\"organic work\\" and \\"building from the foundations.\\" In the 20th century, mathematics was a field of endeavor that could be successfully pursued even with the limited resources that Poland commanded in the interbellum period. = Historical Influences = Over the centuries, Polish mathematicians have influenced the course of history.

The series was written by Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, Greg Rucka, and Mark Waid, with layouts by Keith Giffen. 52 also led into a few limited series spin-offs. 52 consists of 52 issues, published weekly for one year, each issue detailing an actual week chronicling the events that took place during the missing year after the end of Infinite Crisis. The series covers much of the DC Universe, and several characters whose disparate stories interconnect. The story is directly followed by the weekly limited series Countdown to Final Crisis. It was the first weekly series published by DC Comics since the short-lived anthology Action Comics Weekly in 1988‚Äì1989. Format The use of a weekly publication format is unusual in the North American comics industry, traditionally based upon a monthly publication. 52 and Batman Eternal (2014/2015) both hold the top position, of being the longest-published serialised weekly comic, published by a major North American publisher. The record was previously held by Action Comics Weekly. The story was originally conceived as being a chronicle of what happened in the \\"missing year\\" between the end of Infinite Crisis and the beginning of One Year Later. It would especially focus on how the world dealt with the disappearance of the \\"big three\\" heroes in the DCU, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. As the series went on, it became more of a platform for which to set the stage for upcoming storylines in the DC Universe. Back-up stories =History of the DC Universe= A backup story titled History of the DC Universe appears in Weeks 2 through 11, with the creative team of Dan Jurgens and Art Thibert. Reminiscent of DC's earlier History of the DC Universe limited series, in this story, Donna Troy explores the history of the DC Universe with the help of Harbinger's recording device. In the final chapter, both the device and a Monitor inform Donna Troy that she was supposed to have died instead of Jade. =Secret Origins= Weeks 12 through 51 feature Secret Origins, written by Mark Waid with a rotating team of artists. Plot In the aftermath of Infinite Crisis, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman have temporarily retired their costumed identities, and the remaining heroes attend a memorial for Superboy in Metropolis. Time traveler Booster Gold attends the memorial, but when Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman do not arrive as he expects, he suspects his robot sidekick Skeets is malfunctioning. After Skeets reports other incorrect historical data, Booster searches fellow time traveler Rip Hunter's desert bunker for answers, but finds it littered with enigmatic scrawled notes and photos of himself and Skeets surrounded by the words \\"his fault\\" with arrows pointing toward them. Booster's reputation is ruined by his unscrupulous attempts to maintain his corporate sponsorships, as well as the arrival of a mysterious new superhero named Supernova. Booster tries to regain the spotlight by containing an exploding nuclear submarine, but is seemingly killed in the attempt. Skeets uses Booster's ancestor Daniel Carter to regain access to Hunter's lab, where he sees the photos and arrows pointing at Skeets himself. Realizing that Hunter is aware of his plan, Skeets traps Carter in a time loop in the bunker and sets out to locate Hunter himself. He eventually corners Hunter and Supernova in the bottle-city of Kandor, where Supernova reveals himself to be Booster Gold, having faked his death with the help of Hunter to uncover Skeets' true intentions. Hunter and Booster attempt to trap Skeets in the Phantom Zone, but Skeets appears to consume the sub-dimension and pursues his two adversaries through time. Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man, is told that the gravestone of his dead wife Sue has been vandalized with an inverted version of Superman's \\"S\\" symbol, the Kryptonian symbol for resurrection. He confronts Cassandra Sandsmark, and she tells Dibny that she is in a cult which believes that Superboy can be resurrected, but they would like to try it first with Sue. Despite his initial consent, Dibny and his friends disrupt the ceremony, and the effigy of Sue crawls to Dibny, calling out to him as it burns; Dibny suffers a nervous breakdown as a result. Ralph seeks out the helmet of Doctor Fate, which promises to revive Sue if he makes certain sacrifices. With unwilling assistance of a demon he tied into knots using Gingold, Dibny journeys with the helmet through the afterlives of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic for personal gain. After several failed attempts to resurrect his wife, Dibny prepares a spell in Doctor Fate's home, the Tower of Nabu. Dibny puts the helmet on, points the gun at his temple, then shoots the helmet to reveal it is actually the sorcerer Felix Faust. Faust was posing as Nabu to give Dibny's soul to the demon Neron in exchange for his freedom. Neron kills Dibny, but realizes too late that Dibny's spell has trapped him and Faust inside a circle of binding that can only be undone by the person who originally created it. With Ralph's death, Neron and Faust are seemingly trapped together in the tower for all eternity. Ralph and Sue Dibny are reunited in death as ghost detectives. Lex Luthor announces the Everyman Project, a program designed to give ordinary people superpowers. John Henry Irons deactivates his niece Natasha's Steel armor after an argument about responsibility, then denies her pleas to be allowed to join the Everyman project. Following an encounter with Luthor, Irons' skin transforms into stainless steel, causing Natasha to accuse him of hypocrisy. Out of spite, she enrolls in the Everyman Project and becomes a member of Luthor's superhero team Infinity, Inc. Irons learns that Luthor can deactivate Everyman Project-given abilities and that they expire naturally after approximately six months. Luthor negates the powers of one of Natasha's teammates during a battle with fatal results, and Irons uses the death of her friend to convince Natasha to question Luthor's motives. After Luthor, angered by reports that he is incompatible with the treatment, deactivates the powers of the majority of the Everyman subjects on New Year's Eve, resulting in many of them falling from the sky to their deaths, Natasha works undercover to expose Luthor. Luthor eventually learns the reports were falsified by employees out of fear for what he might do with genuine superpowers, and gives himself the powers of Superman. He discovers Natasha's spying and beats her violently using his newfound powers. Irons and the Teen Titans attack Lexcorp and bring Luthor to justice with Natasha's help. Beast Boy offers Natasha, in her rebuilt Steel armor, membership in the Teen Titans, but she declines in favor of forming a new team with her uncle. Animal Man, Starfire, and Adam Strange are marooned on an alien planet after the events of Infinite Crisis. They are pursued through space by agents of Lady Styx, whose forces are conquering and overrunning planets on a path of destruction toward Earth. They are rescued and joined by Lobo, who possesses the Emerald Eye of Ekron and claims he has found religion and turned his back on violence for the sake of his beloved Space Dolphins. Lady Styx hired Lobo to capture the heroes, but he instead delivers them to her so they can fight her. The heroes triumph, but not before encountering the Emerald Head of Ekron, a Green Lantern who fights alongside them to reobtain his eye (which is, in fact, a supercharged power ring). During the fight, Animal Man is injected with a toxin and dies. After Starfire and Strange lay his body to rest and leave, Animal Man awakens to find the aliens who gave him his powers standing over him, upgrading his powers to allow him to gain powers from any sentient being in the universe. Animal Man acquires the powers of Sun-Eaters, which he uses to return to Earth. He is pursued by Lady Styx's assassins, who are killed by Starfire just as they arrive at his home. Black Adam, the superhuman leader of Kahndaq, forges a coalition with several other countries against the United States' superhuman supremacy under the Freedom of Power Treaty until Adrianna Tomaz, a former slave, shows Adam how he can use his abilities more peacefully to help his country. Adam convinces Captain Marvel to give Tomaz the power of Isis, and Adam and Isis free enslaved children across Africa. The Question, Renee Montoya, and Batwoman, meanwhile, discover that Intergang is preparing to invade Gotham City. Following a lead, the Question and Montoya fly to Kahndaq, where they prevent a suicide bombing at Black Adam and Isis' wedding, for which Adam awards them one of Kahndaq's highest honors. The four uncover Intergang, which is inducting children into a religion of crime based on its Crime Bible. Black Adam finds Isis' crippled brother Amon among the children and shares his power with him, and Amon is reborn as Osiris. Osiris befriends a seemingly timid anthropomorphic crocodile named Sobek, who joins Black Adam's Black Marvel Family. Adam and Isis inform the Freedom of Power Treaty member nations that Kahndaq is no longer interested in consolidating power or in executing superhumans. Will Magnus, creator of the Metal Men, is abducted to Oolong Island, where Intergang and Chang Tzu are forcing kidnapped scientists to develop new weapons for them. Magnus' anti-depressants are confiscated and he is ordered to build a Plutonium Man robot, but Magnus also secretly rebuilds miniature versions of the Metal Men. The scientists activate three of their Four Horsemen of Apokolips, which target Black Adam. Suspicious of Black Adam, Amanda Waller destroys Osiris' reputation by maneuvering him into killing the Persuader and leaking footage of the incident to the media. Osiris retires from the public eye as a result, and acid rain ravages Kahndaq. Osiris, convinced that he is the cause of Kahndaq's new miseries, asks Captain Marvel to remove his powers, but he is confronted by Isis and Black Adam and returns to Kahndaq. Sobek tricks Osiris into turning back into Amon and devours him, revealing himself to be the fourth Horseman, Famine. The other Horsemen battle Black Adam and Isis. Isis is poisoned by Pestilence and dies while asking Adam to avenge her and Osiris' deaths. Grief-stricken and enraged to the point of madness, Black Adam destroys the country of Bialya, base of the Four Horsemen, and murders the country's entire population before killing the last of the Horsemen. He attacks Oolong Island, but the scientists capture and imprison him. The Justice Society of America invade the island to arrest Adam and subdue the scientists, but Adam escapes and embarks on a week-long rampage across the globe, during which he kills several superhumans. During an enormous battle between many superhumans and Black Adam, Captain Marvel is unable to convince the Egyptian pantheon to remove Adam's powers, so he instead reverts him to Teth-Adam and changes Adam's magic word from \\"Shazam\\" to a new phrase. Teth-Adam goes missing in the resulting explosion and wanders the Earth powerlessly as he tries to guess the new magic word. He is seen wearing boots made from Sobek's skin. The Question and Montoya train with Richard Dragon in Nanda Parbat, where Montoya learns that the Question is dying from lung cancer and wants her to replace him. After they discover a prophecy in the Crime Bible about Batwoman's death, the two join her fight against Intergang in Gotham City. When the Question's condition worsens, Montoya journeys back to Nanda Parbat in a failed attempt to save his life. Shortly after they leave Gotham, Intergang discovers Batwoman's identity and attempts to sacrifice her to fulfill the prophecy. Montoya, as the new Question, joins Nightwing and former Intergang member Kyle Abbot in trying to save Batwoman, but they are unable to prevent Mannheim from stabbing her with a ceremonial dagger. Batwoman fatally wounds Mannheim and survives. After she recovers, Montoya shines the restored Bat-Signal to call Batwoman back to work. Skeets is revealed to be Mister Mind, who has been using Skeets' metallic body as a cocoon to metamorphose into a gigantic, monstrous form that feeds on time itself. Rip Hunter and Booster escape to the end of the Infinite Crisis, where they witness the secret creation of 52 identical parallel universes, which Mister Mind intends to consume. Daniel Carter reappears as the new Supernova and saves Hunter and Booster, restoring the Phantom Zone in the process. Mister Mind alters events in the 52 universes, creating new histories and a new status quo for each. Booster and Supernova trap Mister Mind in the remains of Skeets' shell and send him back in time to the beginning of the year, where he is captured by Dr. Sivana, trapped in a time loop for all eternity. Hunter, Booster, and Supernova agree to keep the restored multiverse's existence a secret, and Will Magnus rebuilds Skeets, using a copy he had made of the robot's memories. =World War III= Week 50 of 52 and the four-issue World War III limited series, which was released the same week, depict the superhumans' battle with Black Adam. World War III also depicts Aquaman's transformation into the Dweller of the Depths, Martian Manhunter's change in outlook, Donna Troy's assumption of the Wonder Woman mantle, Supergirl's return to the 21st century, Jason Todd pretending to be Nightwing, and Cassandra Cain being drugged to turn evil and join Deathstroke. Science Squad The Science Squad are a group of fictional scientists and mad scientists in the DC Comics Universe. The group was created by writer Grant Morrison who stated, \\"I love writing cowardly, petulant, irascible supervillains much more than I enjoy writing truly evil ones, so this whole plot strand was a joy from beginning to end.\\" The members of the team are Veronica Cale, Doctor Death, Doctor Sivana, I.Q., Will Magnus, T.O. Morrow, Komrade Krabb, Dr. Tyme, and Robby Reed enemies Doctor Cyclops, Baron Bug, and Dr. Rigoro Mortis. They are commanded by Chang Tzu. They are featured prominently throughout the series, particularly in Week 46. Secret message Dan DiDio included a hidden message in his \\"DC Nation\\" column in the back of Week 37. The message is spelled out using the first letter of every third word: \\"the secret of fifty-two is that the multiverse still exists\\". Collected editions The lead stories of the series are collected, with commentary from the creators and other extras, into four trade paperbacks: * Volume 1 (collects #1-13, 304 pages, May 2007, ) * Volume 2 (collects #14-26, 304 pages, July 2007, ) * Volume 3 (collects #27-39, 304 pages, September 2007, ) * Volume 4 (collects #40-52, 304 pages, November 2007, ) All 52 issues were also available in the 52 Omnibus hardcover (1,216 pages, November 2012, ). The collection has also been made available in a two-volume edition that includes bonus material after each chapter: * Volume 1 (collects #1-26, 584 pages, June 2015, ) * Volume 2 (collects #27-52, 616 pages, January 2017, ) Other connected collections include: * 52: The Companion (224 pages, October 2007, ) * DC: World War III (collects 52 Week 50 and the entire four-issue World War III limited series, 128 pages, December 2007, ) * 52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen (Collects #1-6, 144 pages, May 2008 ) * The Question: The Five Books of Blood (collects \\"Crime Bible - Five Lessons of Blood\\" #1-5, 128 pages, June 2009, ) * Wizard #184 Spin-offs Taking advantage of the popularity of the series, DC issued several series of comics based on the individual threads of 52 that began several months after 52 ended. Booster Gold (vol. 2) is an ongoing series that sees the eponymous hero and Rip Hunter travel through time to fix history as \\"the greatest superhero never known\\". The six-issue 52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen miniseries covers the Four Horsemen's battle with Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Black Adam: The Dark Age, another six-issue miniseries, follows Teth-Adam's quest to restore his powers and bring Isis back to life; it takes place between the end of 52 and Mary Marvel's corruption in Countdown to Final Crisis. Two strands of the 52 story were taken and put together with back-ups from the new Countdown to Final Crisis story. Countdown to Adventure looks at the fate of space- travelers Adam Strange, Animal Man, and Starfire in their new roles after their journey over the course of eight issues, with a back-up story following Forerunner. Countdown to Mystery is another eight-issue series looking at the new Doctor Fate and a back-up story focusing on Eclipso. These include: * Booster Gold vol. 2 #1-47 ‚Äì The further adventures of Booster Gold, Supernova, and Rip Hunter as they try to preserve the fractured timeline. * Black Adam: The Dark Age #1-6 ‚Äì In the aftermath of World War III, Black Adam tries to recoup his losses, for both his powers and his personal life. * Infinity Inc. #1-12 ‚Äì Steel and the remaining members of Luthor's Everyman Project team together to form a new Infinity Inc. * 52 Aftermath: Crime Bible - Five Lessons of Blood #1-5 ‚Äì The Question and Batwoman investigate crimes, leading them deeper into the Crime Bible. * 52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen #1-6 ‚Äì Follows Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman against the Four Horsemen of Apokolips. * Metal Men #1-8 ‚Äì Follows Dr. William \\"Will\\" Magnus and the new version of the Metal Men as they battle Will's brother, David, who wants to destroy them. * Detective Comics ‚Äì Follows Batwoman and the Question. * The Great Ten #1-9 ‚Äì Follows the Chinese superteam. In other media =Action figures= In September 2006, DC Direct premiered a line of action figures based on 52. The first wave, featuring figures based on Batwoman, Isis, Booster Gold, Animal Man, and Supernova, was released in May 2007.DC Comics.com DC Direct \\"Action Figures - ALL\\", accessed April 14, 2011. =Novelization= Ace Books, under the imprint of the Berkley Publishing Group and published by the Penguin Group, released a novelization written by Greg Cox, with cover art by J. G. Jones and Alex Sinclair, and its design by George Brewer. The novel primarily adapts the weekly limited series and the World War III tie-in miniseries. The novel deals with the plotlines of Montoya, the Question, Black Adam, Booster Gold, Skeets, and the 52 Earths, dropping the Luthor/Steel/Everyman Project, Ralph Dibny, and space plotlines completely and including only part of the \\"Science Squad\\" storyline, keeping in the evil geniuses and their work for Intergang but leaving out Will Magnus' ongoing plot; in his introduction, Cox explains that it was not possible to adapt all the plotlines of 52 within a novel of reasonable length. Outside of the loss of these various storylines from the book, events play out in an essentially identical manner, with most of the dialogue itself even lifted from the comics verbatim. There are some minor cosmetic changes along the way (for instance, on Week 3, Black Adam kills Intergang thug Rough House as opposed to Terra-Man), but in the final chapter, a lot of the specifics of Mister Mind's cross-time battle with Rip Hunter, Booster Gold, and Supernova are altered. The villain reveals himself in front of a gathered group of heroes in Metropolis, rather than to just Booster and Rip in the Fortress of Solitude; the rebirth of the multiverse is credited to Mister Mind's transformation, rather than the Crisis; and the weapon stolen from Steel by Booster during World War III is actually put to use against Mind, which it was not in the comic, and is the cause of his unexplained-in-the-comic shrinking. =Audiobook= In December 2007, GraphicAudio released the first half of a full cast audiobook adaptation based on the novel by Greg Cox. Like GraphicAudio's audiobook of Infinite Crisis, this spans two volumes (each 6 hours long) with 6 CDs and features a full cast, music, and sound effects. Volume 2 was released in February 2008.

For example, in the episode \\"Things You Can't Outrun\\", the Flash team opt to incarcerate criminal metahumans in \\"Area 52\\" at S.T.A.R. Labs. In the second season, inter-dimensional breaches are made between Earth-One and Earth-Two, and 52 separate portals are located.

It is endemic to the Gulf of California. Description Adults are similar in appearance to the western gull with a white head, dark, slate-colored back and wings, and a thick yellow bill. Its legs are yellow, though first winter birds do display pink legs like those of the western gull. It attains full plumage at three years of age. This species is tied with slaty-backed gull for the world's fourth-largest gull species and is one of the largest gulls in the world, being slightly larger than the western gull. It measures in length and spans across the wings.Gulls: Of North America, Europe, and Asia by Klaus Malling Olsen & Hans Larsson. Princeton University Press (2004). . The body mass of this species can vary from .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . Distribution and habitat Yellow-footed gulls are native to the Gulf of California in Mexico. Most are non-migratory, but an increasing number have been traveling to California's Salton Sea and southwards to Sonora during nonbreeding periods. Their breeding habitat is the Gulf of California, where they nest, in April, either independently or in colonies. They are found on sandy and rocky coasts or islands, often with little vegetation. Behavior The birds are scavengers as well as foragers, feeding on small fish and invertebrates, carcases of marine mammals and offal, and preying upon seabird chicks and eggs (including pelican eggs). They sometimes scavenge around waste dumps and docks for refuse but seldom fly far inland. Yellow-footed gulls nest on the beach, a few metres above the upper limits of the highest tides. A pair of birds defends a small territory between the nest and the sea. The nest is a scrape in the sand with a meagre lining of seaweed or dry plant material. Usually, three eggs are laid, olive or buff in color with dark blotches, and incubation is probably done by both parents. The young are fully fledged and leave the nest when they are about seven weeks old. Status The population is estimated at about 60,000 individuals and appears to be stable, so the IUCN has rated the species as being of \\"least concern\\".

The roads were named after Prince Edward in 1922, later Edward VIII of the United Kingdom (later The Duke of Windsor), after his visit to Hong Kong. Prince Edward Station and the Prince Edward area in Hong Kong are both named after Prince Edward Road, rather than Prince Edward himself.  Prince Edward Road  In the beginning of the 1920s, the Hong Kong government was developing the Mong Kok district and decided to build a road connecting this to Kowloon City. In April 1922, Prince Edward (later Edward VIII) came to Hong Kong and visited the construction of this road. Due to this visit, the government named this road Prince Edward Road. In the 1930s, Prince Edward Road was extended to the area of Ngau Chi Wan. During Japanese occupation, the road was renamed as Kashima-dori (ÈπøÂ≥∂ÈÄö„Çä).  Prince Edward Road West  Prince Edward Road West is a road between Tai Kok Tsui, Mong Kok, Kowloon Tong and Kowloon City. This road was originally named Edward Avenue () before 1924. It was later renamed Prince Edward Road () in 1924, and in 1958 the Chinese name was changed from what was literally \\"British Royal Prince Road\\" to a new name () that is literally \\"Crown Prince Road\\" . In 1979 it became the Prince Edward Road West. Prince Edward Road West starts from Kowloon City where it succeeds Prince Edward Road East. It runs across Kowloon City and Prince Edward, and ends at Tai Kok Tsui at an intersection with Tong Mi Road and West Kowloon Corridor. It is worth noting that the section of Prince Edward Road West from Olympic Park to Nathan Road runs unidirectionally from east to west. Boundary Street serves as its complement by providing a nearby route which runs from west to east.  Prince Edward Road East  Prince Edward Road East is a road between Kowloon City and San Po Kong. It was originally the Sai Kung Road and later part of the Clear Water Bay Road. It later became part of the Prince Edward Road. In 1979 it became the Prince Edward Road East. The modern Prince Edward Road East starts from Choi Hung Interchange, where it meets Clear Water Bay Road to the northeast and Kwun Tong Road to the southeast. Then it goes west along the boundary between San Po Kong and the retired Kai Tak Airport, and finally ends at Olympic Park in Kowloon City, where it branches into three roads, Ma Tau Chung Road, Argyle Street and Prince Edward Road West.

The right to counsel is generally regarded as a constituent of the right to a fair trial. Historically, however, not all countries have always recognized the right to counsel. The right is often included in national constitutions. 153 of the 194 constitutions currently in force have language to this effect.Elkins, Zachary, Tom Ginsburg, and James Melton. 2013. Constitute: The World's Constitutions to Read, Search, and Compare. https://www.constituteproject.org/ Around the world =Australia= In Australia, suspects and defendants have the right to have legal representation during investigation and trial. Australian law does not recognize a right to publicly-funded legal defense, but does recognize that in the absence of counsel the accused may not receive a fair trial as mandated by law. Only the states of Victoria and New South Wales have dedicated public defender systems. Courts have the power to stay proceedings when they determine there is a risk of unfair trial. The High Court of Australia ruled in Dietrich v The Queen that while indigent defendants are not entitled to legal defense as a guaranteed right, a judge should typically grant a request for an adjournment or stay in most serious criminal cases where a defendant is unrepresented, and should allow a trial where a defendant accused of a serious criminal offense is left unrepresented to proceed only in exceptional circumstances.https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/traditional-rights-and- freedoms-encroachments-by-commonwealth-laws-alrc-interim-report-127/10-fair- trial/right-to-a-lawyer/ Each state and territory of Australia has a Legal Aid Commission to provide legal services in criminal, civil, and family law matters to the indigent, but will only assist those who meet their threshold criteria, particularly with regard to income. Anyone accused of a Commonwealth crime, or crime falling within the jurisdiction of the federal government, has the right to ask a judge for counsel within two weeks of committal, and the judge may appoint a lawyer if convinced that the defendant cannot afford counsel. A network of community legal centres also exists to provide legal services free of charge to poor people who do not qualify for Legal Aid. Although they receive federal and state funding, they are independent non- profit organizations which rely on lawyers to staff them on a volunteer basis. Most cannot adequately keep up with demand and must turn some people away. Those who cannot obtain any kind of legal assistance may go unrepresented if they cannot pay for a lawyer.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-01/no-right- to-justice/6328790?nw=0https://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/5494/why-dont-we- have-the-right-to-free-legal- represent.aspxhttps://info.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/public- safety-and-law/legal-aid =Brazil= The Constitution of Brazil declares that all defendants have right to counsel, and mandates that all defendants who cannot pay for an attorney are entitled to state-funded legal representation in all criminal and civil cases.https://www.laf.org.tw/ifla2018/upload/2018/11/(Update)National%20Report%201-3_Brazil_Prof.%20Cleber%20Francisco%20Alves%20&%20Mr.%20Andr%C3%A9%20Castro.pdf Public defender's offices exist at both state and federal levels as mandated by the constitution.

A public defender can be assigned on request of the defendant or if the court so chooses. In addition to the public defender system, the Ethiopian judicial system also provides for private attorneys to offer pro bono representation to indigent defendants. Article 49 of the Federal Court Advocates‚Äô Code of Conduct mandates that private attorneys must offer a minimum of 50 hours of legal representation for free or with minimum payment.file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/Public%20Defender%E2%80%99s%20Services%20in%20Ethiopia.pdf =China= According to Article 125 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Article 11 of the Criminal Procedure Law of 1996, Chinese citizens have the right to legal counsel in court. The accused's right to counsel in China only comes into being once a case goes to trial. It does not exist at the investigative stage. A suspect under investigation only has the right to retain a lawyer to assist in securing bail, making procedural complaints, and seeking details from the police on the nature of the crime alleged, and not to start building a defense. A suspect gains the right to retain a lawyer upon having been interrogated or subjected to movement restrictions by the authorities. In cases defined as involving state secrets, the right to counsel is more heavily restricted: a lawyer may only be appointed to assist the suspect with the investigating body's permission.https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&context;=ealr#:~:text=Under%20Article%2096%20of%20the,from%20police%20of%20the%20nature Chinese law allows courts to appoint a lawyer for a defendant unable to hire one, and it is mandatory for courts to appoint a lawyer to the blind, deaf, and mute, minors, and anyone facing the death penalty.

However, only those deemed eligible are entitled to state-funded representation if they cannot afford a lawyer. The Israeli Justice Ministry maintains the Public Defense unit to provide state-funded legal counsel to eligible defendants. In criminal trials, all defendants charged with a severe crime carrying a penalty of at least 10 years imprisonment and indigent defendants charged with a crime carrying a penalty of at least 5 years imprisonment are entitled to representation by the Public Defense, as are juveniles and the disabled. All indigent detainees and detainess for whom a request has been filed for remand until the end of proceedings are also entitled to representation from the Public Defense, as are prisoners who are facing parole hearings, anyone facing extradition proceedings, and sentenced defendants requesting retrial when cause is found.https://www.justice.gov.il/En/Units/PublicDefense/PublicInfo/Pages/Applicants.aspx All defendants facing civil cases also have the right to counsel. The Ministry of Justice operates a Legal Aid Department to assist those eligible for state- funded legal aid in civil cases. Legal aid in civil cases is provided for a variety of fields, and applicants must typically meet the financial eligibility test to receive legal aid. However, in some categories of civil cases, legal aid is provided without an examination of financial eligibility.https://www.gov.il/en/service/legal_aid_application =Japan= The Constitution of Japan guarantees the right to legal counsel. If a defendant is a minor or is found to be unable to pay for a lawyer, the court may appoint one at no expense to the defendant. The right to court-appointed counsel only exists after charges are brought. Following arrest a suspect is entitled to one free visit from a duty lawyer who will provide legal advice, explain the law and procedures involved, and contact the suspect's family, but the suspect must pay for further assistance from the attorney. Suspects are not entitled to have a lawyer present when interrogated by police.https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/10/call-eliminate-japans-hostage- justice-system-japanese-legal- professionalshttps://japan.embassy.gov.au/tkyo/arrests.html#legalaid =Russia= All criminal defendants and suspects in Russia have the right to legal assistance. A suspect has the right to a lawyer from the time they are declared a suspect in a criminal case. The Russian Code of Criminal Procedure mandates that if a detained person has no lawyer, the detective, investigator, or judge must request the local bar association to appoint an attorney for the suspect. The head of the bar association then distributes appointments between its members, who do not have the right to refuse the case assignments. The attorney must ask the family of the suspect if they have appointed anyone else, and if not the investigator or judge gives them power of attorney. However, the public defender system has been heavily criticized by Russian lawyers for the way it works in practice. Investigators often appoint lawyers themselves without waiting for the detained to choose, and prefer to appoint lawyers with whom they have a comfortable working relationship with, so in practice the publicly appointed lawyers will often in fact help the prosecution by not vigorously defending their clients and simply signing the necessary documents and attending the necessary proceedings, and investigators will stop appointing lawyers who inconvenience the prosecution. Defendants may opt for privately retained counsel instead, though some administrative obstacles exist. For cases tried by the Federal Security Service or Main Investigative Directorate, there is a closed group of attorneys who represent defendants.https://meduza.io/en/feature/2016/01/26/an-indefensible-public- defender-system =United Kingdom= England and Wales Before the Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836, felony defendants did not have the formal right of being represented by a counsel in English courts although, from the mid-18th century such had been routinely indulged where defendants could afford them. It was thought, at the time, that the presence of defence counsel would serve no purpose in criminal proceedings, where what matters is deciding fact: the defendant should simply tell the truth to the court, without the interference of some counsel. William Hawkins in his A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown: or a system of the principal matters, relating to that subject, digested under their proper heads Vol. II. of 1721 wrote........ > [I]t requires no manner of Skill to make a plain and honest Defence, which > ... is always the best; the Simplicity and Innocence, artless and ingenuous > Behaviour of one whose Conscience acquits him, having something in it more > moving and convincing than the highest Eloquence of a Person speaking in a > cause not their own. This changed as more and more prosecutions became, for reasons of public policy, funded by the Crown, who employed professional counsel. An innate sense of fair-play prevailed therefore, permitting defence counsel to be present, albeit at the defendant's own expense. Penurious defendants were obviously at a significant disadvantage. Legal aid in England and Wales is provided through the Legal Aid Agency, which provides aid in both civil and criminal cases. Legal aid in civil cases is means-tested, with only those showing they cannot afford the legal costs and the case is serious eligible. In criminal cases, everyone questioned at a police station is entitled to free legal advice. Legal aid in criminal trials is also means-tested unless the defendant is under 16 or under 18 and in full-time education, or receiving certain benefits. A defendant may be asked to pay a contribution for their defense.https://www.gov.uk/legal- aid/eligibilityhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/criminal-legal-aid-means- testing#overviewhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47934641 Scotland The Scottish Legal Aid Board provides civil and criminal legal aid in Scotland. In criminal cases, legal aid is provided if facing serious charges likely to result in a prison sentence or job loss, the mentally and physically disabled, those who do not speak English as a first language, those held on remand, and those facing appeals. Those requesting legal aid must show that they cannot afford to pay their own legal costs or doing so would be unfair to themselves or their families.https://www.mygov.scot/legal-aid/criminal-cases/ Legal aid in civil cases is provided for applicants who show they cannot pay for their own legal costs, as well as those whose cases are deemed to have a legal basis to go forward.https://www.mygov.scot/legal-aid/civil-cases/ Northern Ireland The Legal Services Agency of Northern Ireland provides civil and criminal legal aid. Civil legal aid is means-tested. Criminal legal aid is provided free of charge to anyone facing police questioning. For criminal trials, legal aid is means-tested and is also merit-tested to determine whether it is in the interests of justice that the defendant receive legal aid.https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/legal-aid-schemes =United States= The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: The assistance of counsel clause includes, as relevant here, five distinct rights: the right to counsel of choice, the right to appointed counsel, the right to conflict- free counsel, the effective assistance of counsel, and the right to represent oneself pro se. A defendant does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in any civil proceeding, including a deportation hearing (even though deportability is often a collateral consequence of criminal conviction).INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032 (1984); Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135 (1945). However, as described below, there are certain civil proceedings where parties have a right to appointed counsel; such a right is pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment's due process or equal protection clause, a state constitution's due process or equal protection clause, or a federal/state statute.National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel, http://www.civilrighttocounsel.org Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest,Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153 (1988). scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee),Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1 (1983). criminal defendants have a right to be represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous deprivation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140 (2006). Appointment of counsel for indigent litigants A criminal defendant unable to afford counsel has the right to appointed counsel at the government's expense. While the Supreme Court recognized this right gradually, it currently applies in all federal and state criminal proceedings where the defendant faces authorized imprisonment greater than one year (a \\"felony\\") or where the defendant is actually imprisoned, including imposition of a suspended incarceration sentence of any length.In chronological order, Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932) (\\"special circumstances\\" in capital cases); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 (1938) (all federal cases); Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455 (1942) (‚Äúspecial circumstances‚Äù in non-capital cases); Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52 (1961) (all capital cases); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963) (all felony cases), overruling Betts, 316 U.S. 455; Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972) (all actual imprisonment); Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654 (2002) (suspended sentences). Criminal defendants in misdemeanor cases do not have a right to appointed counsel if they are not sentenced to actual imprisonment,Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979). even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime,Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738 (1994), overruling Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U.S. 222 (1980). or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment (although for parole revocation, the court evaluates the right to counsel on a case-by-case-basis).Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973). Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal,Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75 (1988); McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, 486 U.S. 429 (1988); Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259 (2000). or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal,Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551 (1987). even if facing execution.Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1 (1989).. One federal court has held that a state court must appoint counsel upon imposition of probation, regardless of whether a separate suspended sentence of incarceration is also imposed and regardless of whether counsel is provided for any subsequent probation revocation proceeding,Shayesteh v. City of South Salt Lake, 217 F.3d 1281, 1283‚Äì84 (10th Cir. 2000) while others have held or suggested that if probation is imposed without counsel, then a person may not be subsequently jailed for violation of that probation. United States v. Foster, 904 F.2d 20, 21 (9th Cir. 1990); United States v. Perez-Macias, 335 F.3d 421 (5th Cir. 2003) (dicta); United States v. Pollard, 389 F.3d 101 (4th Cir. 2004) (dicta) . With respect to federal law on civil proceedings, there is a constitutional right to counsel for juveniles in delinquency proceedings,In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967) and there is a right to \\"qualified and independent assistance\\" (although not necessarily an attorney) for prisoners involuntarily transferred to a mental health facility.Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980) The federal constitutional right to appointed counsel in termination of parental rights proceedings is on a case-by-case basis.Lassiter v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 452 U.S. 18 (1981) For civil contempt proceedings related to failure to pay child support, the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal constitutional right to counsel even if the litigant is being jailed, provided that all of the following is true: a) the state is providing sufficient procedural safeguards to ensure the person actually has the ability to pay but is refusing to do so; b) the matter is not \\"unusually complex\\"; and c) the plaintiff is neither the government nor represented by counsel.Turner v. Rogers, 564 S. Ct. 431 (2011) Federal statutory law provides for a right to counsel in certain types of federal court proceedings, such as civil forfeiture of a primary residence or proceedings involving those in active military service.National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel, http://civilrighttocounsel.org/major_developments?jurisdiction=federal Finally, all states provide a right to counsel by either statute, court decision, or court rule in at least some civil proceedings, with the most commonly covered proceedings being termination of parental rights, abuse/neglect, civil commitment, paternity, and civil contempt.National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel state status map, http://civilrighttocounsel.org/map; John Pollock, 'The Case Against Case-By- Case: Courts Identifying Categorical Rights to Counsel in Basic Human Needs Civil Cases', 61 Drake L.J. 763 (Spring 2013); Laura Abel and Max Rettig, 'State Statutes Providing for a Right to Counsel in Civil Cases', 40 Clearinghouse Rev. J. of Poverty L. and Pol'y 245 (2006); Clare Pastore, 'Life After Lassiter: An Overview of State-Court Right-to-Counsel Decisions, 40 Clearinghouse Rev. J. of Poverty L. and Pol'y 186 (2006). The state court decisions can be based on interpretation of either the federal or state constitution, and under basic principles of federalism, a state court can grant more rights under its state constitution than the Supreme Court has recognized under the federal constitution.American Constitution Society, 'Why State Constitutions Matter' Conflict-free counsel Whether counsel is retained or appointed, the defendant has a right to counsel without a conflict of interest. If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal.Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776 (1987); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335 (1980); Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475 (1978). The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived,See United States v. Curcio, 680 F.2d 881 (2d Cir. 1982). but some conflicts are unwaivable.See, e.g., United States v. Schwarz, 283 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Fulton, 5 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 1993). Ineffective assistance of counsel In Strickland v. Washington (1984), the Court held that, on collateral review, a defendant may obtain relief if the defendant demonstrates both # that defense counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness (the \\"performance prong\\") and # that, but for the deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different (the \\"prejudice prong\\").Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland, a defendant who pleads guilty must show that, but for counsel's deficient performance, they would not have pleaded guilty.Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985). In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have pleaded guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). Pro se representation In Faretta v. California (1975), the court held that a criminal defendant has the right to knowingly and voluntarily opt for pro se representation at trial.Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975). This right is not per se violated by the appointment of standby counsel.McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168 (1984). There is no constitutional right to self- representation on appeal.Martinez v. California Court of Appeals, 528 U.S. 152 (2000). =Singapore= The Constitution of Singapore mandates that \\"Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.\\" The Supreme Court of Singapore ruled that this means that the accused must be given counsel in a reasonable period of time from the arrest, but not necessarily immediately after the arrest.https://www.gov.sg/article/is-it-a-constitutional-right-to-have-access- to-a-lawyer-immediately-after-being-arrested In criminal cases, the government only provides state-funded legal assistance when the accused faces the death penalty, but it provides legal representation and advice in a variety of civil cases. State-funded legal assistance is provided through the Ministry of Law's Legal Aid Bureau. Most clients must pay a fee to the Legal Aid Bureau, though their financial means are taken into account when the amount they must pay is determined. The Law Society of Singapore also provides pro bono legal representation to indigent defendants facing criminal charges that do not carry the death penalty through its Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.

PPSF holds a seat on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) executive council, though it is generally considered to have a limited influence over Palestinian politics. Early history The PPSF was founded as the Palestinian Popular Struggle Organization (PPSO) in the West Bank in 1967 by Bahjat Abu Gharbiyah, a former Ba'athist, following a split from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). It had close ties to Fatah, and in 1971 it officially became a Fatah-affiliated organization. It fell out with Yasir Arafat in 1973, and left Fatah to act independently. In 1974 PPSF left the PLO to become a founding member of the Rejectionist Front with other radical Palestinian factions who rejected the Ten Point Program adopted by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In the 1970s the PPSF hijacked airplanes, and also attacked civilian Israeli passengers in Athens Airport in 1969. Initially close to Egypt after its break with Fatah, it eventually slipped into decline. In 1982 it was revived jointly by Syria and Libya, in an attempt to bolster hardliner and anti-Arafat forces in the PLO (Syria was simultaneously fighting the PLO in Lebanon). Members of the PPSF were mentioned as possible suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie Bombing, believed to have been orchestrated by the Libyan regime, but Samir Ghawshah denied the charges.BBC News  WORLD  Palestinian radicals deny bomb link Reconciliation with PLO and PNA politics In 1991, PPSF was allowed to rejoin the PLO after accepting United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 and the concept of negotiations with Israel. Ghawshah gained a seat on the PLO Executive Committee. The PPSF split into two, the main group, the Samir Ghawsha faction, accepted the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), while Khalid ‚ÄòAbd al-Majid's parallel PPSF opposed it from exile in Damascus, Syria. The Samir Ghawsha faction of PPSF took part in the 1996 Palestinian legislative elections with 12 candidates. Together they got 0.76% of the national vote. The faction also took part in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election as part of the \\"Freedom and Social Justice\\" list, which got 7,127 votes (0.72%) and failed to win a seat. In June 2018 the party was admitted to the Socialist International as consultative member.

Gutfreund turned Salomon Brothers from a private partnership into a publicly traded corporation,Michael Lewis, The End, Portfolio.com, 11 November 2008 which started a trend in Wall Street for investment companies to go public. In 1985, Business Week gave him the nickname \\"King of Wall Street\\".

His father, Manuel Gutfreund, was the owner of a prosperous trucking company. He attended the Lawrenceville School. In 1951, Gutfreund graduated from Oberlin College in Ohio with a degree in English. He considered teaching literature but instead joined the Army. In 1953, he was discharged. His father belonged to the Century Country Club in Purchase, New York (which was at the time a center for the German Jewish establishment) where he often golfed with William (Billy) Salomon, the son of Percy Salomon, one of the three founding brothers of Salomon Brothers. At Billy Salomon's invitation, the young Gutfreund joined Salomon Brothers as a trainee in the statistical department.\\"New York Stories: Landmark Writing from Four Decades of New York Magazine\\" By Steve Fishman p171 Career After several months, Gutfreund became a clerk in the municipal bond department, eventually becoming a trader.

Paul Mozer, head of the Government Bond desk, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by the Treasury rules. When this was discovered and brought to the attention of Gutfreund, he did not immediately suspend Mr. Mozer. The exposure of Mr. Mozer's repeated violations of U.S. government bond auction rules resulted in a significant scandal during which regulators and some politicians called on the firm to be stripped of its Primary Dealer status. This action would have threatened the survival of the firm, then the largest participant in the U.S. government and mortgage bond trading markets. Warren Buffett, who through Berkshire Hathaway had recently acquired a $700 million preferred equity position in Salomon, actively intervened to protect his investment, including briefly serving as CEO of Salomon Brothers. As a result of the scandal, Gutfreund and other senior managers of Salomon were forced to resign in 1991.The Economist: \\"John Gutfreund Resurrection: A Wall Street legend seeks to recapture former glories\\" May 8th 2003 From January 2002, Gutfreund was Senior Managing Director and Executive Committee Member of the investment bank C.E.

The four Republican county committees endorsed Thompson to be the Senator from the new district and was elected in the 2011 general election defeating Democrat Robert \\"Bob\\" Brown. He sits on three Senate committees (Budget and Appropriations, Environment and Energy, and State Government, Wagering, Tourism & Historic Preservation) and two joint committees (Housing Affordability and Public Schools). In May 2017, Thompson introduced a bill to designate Streptomyces griseus as New Jersey's State Microbe, to be added to the state's other state symbols. S. griseus was chosen for this honor because it is a New Jersey native that made unique contributions to healthcare and scientific research worldwide. A strain of S. griseus that produced the antibiotic streptomycin was discovered in New Jersey in 1916 and developed into an antibiotic by a Rutgers University team by Albert Schatz and Selman Waksman in 1943.Senate, No. 3190 State of New Jersey 217th Legislature Introduced May 15, 2017, New Jersey Legislature.

In gridiron football, a guard (G) is a player who lines up between the center and the tackles on the offensive line of a football team on the line of scrimmage used primarily for blocking. Right guards (RG) is the term for the guards on the right of the offensive line, while left guards (LG) are on the left side. Guards are to the right or left of the center. The guard's job is to protect the quarterback from the incoming linemen during pass plays, as well as creating openings (holes) for the running backs to head through. Guards are automatically considered ineligible receivers, so they cannot intentionally touch a forward pass, unless it is to recover a fumble or is first touched by a defender or eligible receiver. Pulling guards David DeCastro lined up at guard. Aside from speed blocking, a guard may also \\"pull\\"‚Äîbacking out of his initial position and running behind the other offensive linemen to sprinting out in front of a running back to engage a defensive player beyond the initial width of the offensive line. This technique is used in most playbooks for outside runs (where the play-side guard pulls as a lead blocker) and on counter plays (where the far-side guard pulls to block a play-side lineman). Vanderbilt's Dan McGugin is credited with first pulling guards. While tackles can also pull, this strategy is generally less common as they are too far away to pull to the opposite side of the formation (for counter plays) and have the responsibility of blocking the outside defender (generally the defensive end) for outside runs. Since the guard is free of responsibility for play-side outside runs and far-side counter plays, pulling is generally a unique responsibility for guards. The Packers sweep was a signature play of the Green Bay Packers in the 1960s, as they won five NFL titles and the first two Super Bowls under head coach Vince Lombardi. The pulling guards were Fuzzy Thurston on the left and hall of famer Jerry Kramer on the right.

Each perch pole has a loop at the top into which the performer may insert either a hand or a foot in order to perform a variety of tricks while hanging down from the loop. During the whole routine, the base at the bottom must balance the pole as the flier shifts their weight from one position to another, climbs up and down, and balances at the top. Types of perch pole There are several variations on the perch pole. They include: * Balancing perch pole * Swing or swinging perch pole * Hanging perch pole * Standing perch pole =Balancing perch pole= The balancing perch pole consists of a tall steel pole (about 25 feet high and weighing about 50 pounds) with interchangeable top and bottom pieces, which are designed for variations of the act. The standard bottom piece is designed for a person to balance the pole on his shoulders and contains grips for holding the pole with his hands, while a substitute bottom piece may be used for a performer who wishes to balance the pole on his head. =Swing or swinging perch pole= The swing pole is an act where one performer holds up a steel pole about twenty feet long as their partner climbs to the top. After the flier fastens themselves to the top of the pole with a neck loop, he spins the pole around as fast as possible until the flier is swinging out almost parallel to the ground. =Hanging perch pole= The hanging perch is a variation on the perch where the pole is hung from an aerial mount point, and a pair of fliers perform tricks and stunts from the pole. Usually this includes the base being supported by an ankle strap on the pole.

The company has been known by numerous names over the years, having been founded as W. Wilson Cobbett Ltd in 1879; it was renamed to Scandinavia Belting during 1911, British Belting & Asbestos in 1925, and BBA Group during 1967. It has been a long term specialist in the manufacture of industrial supplies, particularly in the automotive and aviation sectors. During the Second World War, the company produced materials for British military aircraft, such as the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, and Hawker Typhoon. By the early 1980s, BBA Group was the world's largest supplier of brake pads within the automotive industry, supplying multiple vehicle manufacturers with its products. During the 1980s and 1990s, the firm decided to increasingly orientate itself towards the aviation industry via a string of acquisitions and divestures, starting with the purchase of British aircraft undercarriage specialist APPH in 1986. By 1998, the firm's wholly owned subsidiary, Signature Flight Support, had expanded to possess the world's largest chain of fixed base operators (FBOs). During 2007, the company adopted the name BBA Aviation to indicate its identity as an aviation specialist. During late 2019, following the sale of its Ontic division to CVC Capital Partners in exchange for $1.365 billion; the company rebranded itself as Signature Aviation. History =Early years= Signature Aviation can trace its origins back to W. Wilson Cobbett Ltd, an industrial belting works originally based in Scotland. Its early name came from its two founders, Sir William Fenton and Walter Cobbett, who established the company during 1879 to manufacture textile belts for use on industrial machinery. For its first thirty years, the production and sale of these belts comprised the company's main commercial activity; over time, Wilson Cobbett expanded into numerous specialist industrial niches and developed a global presence. During 1911, as an indication of its international expansion, the company was renamed Scandinavia Belting; it continued to be rebranded throughout the twentieth century, becoming British Belting & Asbestos in 1925. During the interwar period, it manufactured numerous products for the automotive industry; the company was a supplier of the Ford Motor Company on its iconic Model T vehicle as well as to other manufacturers, including Jaguar Cars. British Belting & Asbestos was also active in the aviation sector. During the Second World War, the company produced materials used on several British military aircraft, including the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, and Hawker Typhoon. During 1967, the company opted to rebrand itself under the name BBA Group. During this period, it was largely focused upon the production of automotive materials. By the early 1980s, BBA Group was the world's largest supplier of brake pads within the automotive industry. In 1986, BBA Group made its first major approach into the aviation sector via its acquisition of APPH, a British business that specialised in aircraft undercarriages and hydraulics; shortly thereafter, it also bought a similar business based in North America. During 1992, the company was involved in the creation of Signature Flight Support through the merger of Page Avjet, an executive aircraft interiors business, and Butler fixed base operations. In 1996, BBA Group took full ownership of Signature Flight Support. By this point, the company was structured into two major divisions: Aviation, and Materials Technologies. During 1996, BBA Group purchased Trinity Aerospace Engineering; in 1998, the company moved into jet engine repair and overhaul through the acquisitions of H+S Aviation from Vector Industries, and UNC Airwork Corp, formerly a unit of American conglomerate General Electric. By 1998, Signature Flight Support had expanded to possess the world's largest chain of fixed base operators (FBOs), operating a total of 41 facilities across the globe. =Twenty-first century= During 2000, BBA Group conducted a major divestment, selling off its Mintex brake pad division in exchange for ¬£389m. Around this time, the company also diversified into the flight training sector, purchasing Oxford Aviation, then the largest professional pilot training organisation in Europe, for ¬£55.4 million. During the following year, BBA Group bought American business Aircraft Service International Group ('ASIG'), the acquisition of which reportedly doubled the firm's presence in the commercial ground handling market, for $25m. During 2002, the group's chief executive Roy McGlone stated that management's strategy at that point was to focus on its FBO ventures and to dispose of non- core businesses. As a sign of the company's changes, BBA Group was reclassified upon the London Stock Exchange from the engineering sector to the transport sector. During 2006, BBA Group opted to demerge its materials technology division, which developed and manufactured nonwoven materials used in the hygiene and medical markets and in numerous industrial applications, and friction materials for train brakes: the demerged business was named Fiberweb plc. That same year, Ontic, a legacy aerospace components supplier, was acquired; Oxford Aviation was sold on during the following year. BBA Group's name was changed to BBA Aviation in 2007 to mark its transformation to a focused aviation group. In 2008, BBA Aviation bought the assets of Hawker Beechcraft Services Inc's Line Service Operations in exchange for ¬£65.4 million. During 2011, it bought GE Aviation's fuel measurement business for ¬£38.3m and a new services base at Bozeman in Montana, United States for $10.5m. In 2012, BBA Aviation purchased Dryden Air Services and PLH Aviation in Canada, securing a presence in the Canadian market for the business.\\"Canada, United States: ASIG closes purchase of PLH Aviation Services and Dryden Air Services.\\" MENA Report, 1 September 2012. During 2013, it acquired Maguire Aviation Group for $69 million. That same year, BBA Aviation reportedly withdrew from talks with Dubai Aerospace Enterprise over acquiring aircraft maintenance provider StandardAero. In 2014, BBA Aviation sold APPH (comprising UK sites and US Wichita site) for $128 million to H√©roux-Devtek Inc. In 2015, BBA Aviation significantly increased the reach of the Signature Flight Support network through the acquisition of Landmark Aviation from The Carlyle Group for $2.1 billion; aviation periodical Flight International described the deal as being \\"the largest acquisition in the history of the business aviation services industry\\". During 2017, its ASIG subsidiary was sold off for $202 million. Early that same year, BBA Aviation and Gama Aviation agreed to merge their charter and management operations together, reportedly forming the largest aircraft management business in the United States as a result. In 2018, BBA Aviation acquired fuel specialist EPIC Aviation; that same year, it also bought Firstmark Corp, a provider of proprietary components and subsystems, which was incorporated into the Ontic portfolio. During late 2019, BBA Group decided to sell Ontic onto CVC Capital Partners in exchange for $1.365 billion; the firm also announced a special dividend to shareholders totalling $835 million from the proceeds of the sale. To reflect its change in business focus, the company's board also elected to rename the group Signature Aviation to better align the firm with its most significant brand in its core market.

[retrieved 01 November 2016]. was a Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia by marriage to Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor. She acted as regent on several occasions during the absences of her spouse. Daughter of King Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria, prior to her Imperial marriage she was considered a possible wife for Charles, Prince of Wales; the event, later known in history as the \\"Spanish Match\\", provoked a domestic and political crisis in the Kingdoms of England and Scotland. In the imperial court in Vienna she continued to be strongly influenced by her native Spanish culture (from clothes to music) and also to promote the strengthening of relations between the Imperial and Spanish branches of the House of Habsburg.  Life  = Early years = Infanta Maria Anna of Spain was born in the Palace of El Escorial, near Madrid, on 18 August 1606 as the fourth child and third (but second surviving) daughter of King Philip III of Spain and his wife Margaret of Austria, Archduchess of the Inner Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. Of her seven siblings, only four survived infancy: Anna (later wife of King Louis XIII of France), Philip IV of Spain, Charles (who died young in 1632) and Ferdinand (the later known Cardinal-Infante and Governor of the Spanish Netherlands). Maria Anna's parents had a close kinship: her father was her mother's first cousin once-removed. On her father's side she was the granddaughter of King Philip II of Spain, and his fourth wife and niece Archduchess Anne of Austria, and on her mother's side she was the granddaughter of Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria and his wife Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria. = Betrothal = From early childhood, Maria Anna has played an important role in the matrimonial projects of her father. In adolescence she was betrothed to Archduke John-Charles, eldest son and heir of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and his first wife Maria Anna of Bavaria. Her fiance was her first cousin, being the son of her mother's brother. The marriage never took place due to Archduke John-Charles' early death in 1618.Ludwig Albrecht Gebhardi: Genealogische Geschichte der erblichen Reichsst√§nde in Teutschland; Halle: Johann Jacob Gebauer, 1779, vol. II, p. 519. [retrieved 01 November 2016]. In 1622, King James I of England received an offer from the Spanish King Philip IV to strengthen the relations of their countries through a dynastic marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna. London and Madrid began active negotiations. The possible marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Spanish Infanta, was known in history under the name \\"Spanish Match\\", and caused an internal political crisis in both England and Scotland. In 1623 the Prince of Wales, accompanied by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, visited Madrid to meet his intended bride. However, Maria Anna did not wish to marry a Protestant and Charles would not convert to Catholicism. At the end, the wedding never took place not only for political reasons but also because of the reluctance of the new Spanish King to conclude a dynastic marriage with the House of Stuart.Beatrix Bastl, Jose Luis Colomer: Dos infantas espa√±olas en la corte imperial [retrieved 01 November 2016].Pauline Gregg: King Charles I - The Spanish Match, pp. 72‚Äì89. [retrieved 01 November 2016].Braun, Keller, Schnettger 2016, p. 144.Hengerer 2012, p. 57. Charles eventually married Henrietta Maria of France. = Marriage = At the end of 1626, Maria Anna was betrothed to Ferdinand, the younger brother of her first fianc√©, and the new heir of Emperor Ferdinand II. Ferdinand was her first cousin, being the son of her mother's brother. The formal engagement was preceded by a series of negotiations which were conducted in 1625. That same year, Prince Ferdinand was crowned King of Hungary, and in 1627 King of Bohemia. In the negotiations were included all the life aspects of the Infanta at the court of her future spouse. Despite the desire of the groom that Maria Anna's confessor would be the Jesuit Ambrosio Penalosa, the appointment eventually went to Capuchin Diego Quiroga. In the marriage contract signed by both parties in 1628, it was noted that Maria Anna could retain her rights of inheritance over the Spanish throne, while her older sister Infanta Anna, married to King Louis XIII of France in 1615, was forced to renounce to her rights.Hengerer 2012, p. 57, 64. Maria Anna had left Madrid for Vienna in December 1629, fully three years after her engegement, and nearly five years after the proposal for marriage was first mooted. The journey, once embarked upon, took more than a year to complete. En route by sea, in Genoa complications arose due to an epidemic of the plague that erupted in the Italian Peninsula. For this reason, the party was unable to stop in Bologna, where Cardinal Antonio Barberini (nephew of Pope Urban VIII), was waiting for the Infanta to give her the Golden Rose. The party moved to Naples, where Maria Anna finally received the award. Leaving the Kingdom of Naples, the Infanta crossed the Papal States, having made a pilgrimage to the Basilica della Santa Casa. On this section of her journey, Maria Anna was accompanied by Roman aristocracy, led by another nephew of Pope Urban VIII, Taddeo Barberini, Prince of Palestrina. On 26 January 1631, she arrived in Trieste, where she met Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, her future brother-in-law, who would first stand in for his brother at a wedding- by-proxy and then escort the Infanta to Vienna.Francesca Quatrini: Eleonora d‚ÄôAustria, Maria Anna d‚ÄôAsburgo-Spagna e Maria Ludovica Gonzaga Nevers ‚Äì tre regine in viaggio nell‚ÄôEuropa moderna.

That very day, Maria Anna was married to King Ferdinand of Hungria-Bohemia per procura with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm serving as the proxy. Before the official wedding, King Ferdinand, not trusting the previous portraits that he had seen of the Infanta, decided to secretly view his bride. The Royal oberhofmeister asked for an audience with Maria Anna; on this visit, he was accompanied by some nobles, among whom was her groom. Struck by the beauty of the Infanta, King Ferdinand immediately revealed his identity and began a conversation with Maria Anna in Spanish.Hengerer 2012, pp. 85‚Äì86. The love and respect that the future emperor felt for his wife lasted throughout their marriage. He was never unfaithful to her and never had any illegitimate children.Hengerer 2012, pp. 130‚Äì131. In Vienna on 20 February 1631, Maria Anna was married to King Ferdinand of Hungary-Bohemia. The festivities lasted a whole month. The marriage was described as friendly. Maria Anna was described as happy- tempered, friendly, and intelligent, and she was able to relieve the feelings of the rather melancholic Ferdinand. =Holy Roman Empress and German Queen = Detail of the portrait of Infanta Maria Ana of Austria by Felipe Diricksen, 1630 (Portland Art Museum) Maria Anna arrived at the Imperial court in Vienna with the Spanish fashion, theatre, dance and music (including the first sounded guitar). As the wife of the heir, she maintained good relations with all the members of her husband's family; however, she had a complicated relationship with Ferdinand's stepmother, the Empress Dowager Eleonora Gonzaga, mainly because between both began a competition for influence at the Imperial court. Maria Anna also paid much attention to the arts, especially painting. She collected works of Italian, Spanish and Flemish painters of the late Renaissance and early Baroque.Braun, Keller, Schnettger 2016, pp. 146‚Äì148. In Regensburg on 22 December 1636 Ferdinand was elected as King of the Romans, and a week later he was crowned by the Archbishop of Mainz. Maria Anna was crowned Queen of Germany one month later, on 21 January 1637. After his father's death on 15 February 1637, Ferdinand became Holy Roman Emperor under the regnal name of Ferdinand III and also became sovereign King of Hungary and Bohemia. As his wife, she received the titles of Holy Roman Empress and sovereign Queen. Her coronation as Queen of Hungary took place in Pressburg during the Hungarian Diet of 1637‚Äì1638.Hengerer 2012, p. 172.R. Bireley: Ferdinand II, Counter-Reformation Emperor, 1578 ‚Äî 1637. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2014, p. 302 . Maria Anna, being active in politics as the adviser of her spouse, was an important mediator between the Emperor and their Spanish relatives. Despite the fact that she always defended the interests of her husband, she did not forget the interests of her brothers King Philip IV and the Cardinal-Infante.Braun, Keller, Schnettger 2016, p. 152. In her court, which was consisted mainly of Spaniards, frequent guests were the Spanish ambassador and diplomats. The Emperor, during his absences from the Imperial court in Vienna, appointed his wife as regent, for example in 1645 during the Thirty Years' War, when he was in the Kingdom of Bohemia. = Death = In March 1645 Maria Anna and her children left Linz, due to the approach of the Protestant Swedish army, and moved to Vienna. By April it was ready to cross the Danube there and threatened to occupy the city. The Imperial family fled instead temporarily to Graz.Hengerer 2012, pp. 230‚Äì231. After returning to Vienna, they were forced to move again to Linz because of the plague. The Empress' sixth pregnancy became known in January 1646; four months later, on 12 May at Linz Castle, Maria Anna suddenly felt ill with fever and heavy bleeding and died the next morning. Her unborn child, a girl, was taken out alive from her womb. She was named Maria after her mother, but only lived a few hours. On 24 May both mother and daughter in the same coffin were moved to Vienna and buried in the Imperial Crypt, which already contained the coffins with the remains of the two sons of the Empress who died earlier. The funeral cortege was accompanied by the Spanish ambassador and the Empress' maid of honor. Very upset by the death of his wife and child, the Emperor was unable to attend the funeral.Hengerer 2012, p. 247.Braun, Keller, Schnettger 2016, pp. 141‚Äì142. However, after returning to Vienna in late August he finally paid his respects to the remains of Maria Anna, and in September he announced the engagement of their eldest daughter Maria Anna with Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias. However, the Prince died the following month shortly after the announcement. The Spaniards courtiers members of the late Empress' household who came with her from Spain, including her confessor and the maids of honor of the late Empress, stayed at the Imperial court in Vienna and lived there for a few more years after her death.Hengerer 2012, p. 249.

A French spelling from a 1674 cookbook is franchipane with the earliest modern spelling coming from a 1732 confectioners' dictionary. Originally designated as a custard tart flavored by almonds or pistachios it came later to designate a filling that could be used in a variety of confections and baked goods. Today it is normally made of butter, sugar, eggs, and ground almonds. In some anecdotes it was the kind of sweet that the noblewoman Jacopa da Settesoli brought to St. Francis of Assisi in 1226, when he was dying.

Thracian religion includes the religious practices of the Thracians. Little is known about their mythology and rituals, but some of their gods are depicted in statuary or described in Greek sources. Cults One notable cult, attested from Thrace to Moesia and Scythia Minor, is that of the \\"Thracian horseman\\", also known as the \\"Thracian Heros\\", at Odessos (Varna) attested by a Thracian name as Heros Karabazmos, a god of the underworld usually depicted on funeral statues as a horseman slaying a beast with a spear. Deities Detail of the main fresco of the Aleksandrovo kurgan. The figure is identified with Zalmoxis. Known Thracian deities include: * Sabazios, the Thracian reflex of Indo-European Dyeus, identified with Heros Karabazmos, the \\"Thracian horseman\\". He gained a widespread importance especially after the Roman conquest. After Christianity was adopted, the symbolism of Heros continued as representations of Saint George slaying the dragon (compare Uastyrdzhi/Tetri Giorgi in the Caucasus). * Zibelthiurdos (also \\"Zbelsurdos\\", \\"Zibelthurdos\\"): a god recognized as similar to the Greek Zeus as a wielder of lightning and thunderbolts. * Kotys (\\"Cotys\\", \\"Cotto\\", \\"Cottyto\\", \\"Cottytus\\"), a goddess worshipped with much revelry by Thracian tribes such as the Edonians in the festival Cotyttia.Detschew, Dimiter. Die Thrakische Sprachreste. Wien, 1957: p. 258 (in German) A cult of Cottyto existed in classical Athens. According to Greek sources her priests were called baptes or \\"washers\\" because their pre-worship purification rites involved bathing. Her worship included midnight orgies (orgia). Her name is believed to have meant \\"war, slaughter\\", akin to Old Norse H√∂√∞r \\"war, slaughter\\".Also cognate: Irish cath \\"war, battle\\", early German Hader \\"quarrel\\", Greek k√≥tos \\"hatred\\", Old Church Slavonic kotora \\"fight, brawl\\", Sanskrit ≈õatru \\"enemy, nemesis\\", and Hittite kattu \\"spiteful\\". See Orel, Vladimir. A Handbook of Germanic Etymology. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003: 165. *Pleistoros, to which prisoners of war were sacrified. Several Thracian deities show close analogy to the Greek cult of Dionysus, Orpheus and Persephone (the Dionysian Mysteries): * Bendis was a Thracian goddess of the moon and the huntTheoi Project - Bendis whom the Greeks identified with Artemis, and hence with the other two aspects of formerly Minoan goddesses, Hecate and Persephone. *ZemelƒÅ is probably a cognate of the Proto-Indo-European Earth goddess Dh√©«µh≈çm, akin to Lithuanian ≈Ωemyna and Latvian Zemes MƒÅte, both of which are \\"Mother Earth\\" goddesses. Known Dacian theonyms include: * Zalmoxis, identified by some with the thunder-god Gebele√Øzis,Hdt. 4.94, Their belief in their immortality is as follows: they believe that they do not die, but that one who perishes goes to the deity Salmoxis, or Gebele√Øzis, as some of them call him. an important god of the DaciansHarry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898),(Zalmoxis) or Zamolxis (Zamolxis). Said to have been so called from the bear's skin (zalmos) in which he was clothed as soon as he was born. He was, according to the story current among the Greeks on the Hellespont, a Getan, who had been a slave to Pythagoras in Samos, but was manumitted, and acquired not only great wealth, but large stores of knowledge from Pythagoras, and from the Egyptians, whom he visited in the course of his travels. He returned among the Getae, introducing the civilization and the religious ideas which he had gained, especially regarding the immortality of the soul. Herodotus, however, suspects that he was an indigenous Getan divinity ( Herod.iv. 95) and Thracians.XCV. This Zamolxis, as I have been informed by those Greeks who inhabit the Hellespont and the Euxine, was himself a man, and formerly lived at Samos, in the service of Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus; having obtained his liberty, with considerable wealth, he returned to his country. Here he found the Thracians distinguished equally by their profligacy and their ignorance; whilst he himself had been accustomed to the Ionian mode of life, and to manners more polished than those of Thrace; he had also been connected with Pythagoras, one of the most celebrated philosophers of Greece. He was therefore induced to build a large mansion, to which he invited the most eminent of his fellow-citizens: he took the opportunity of the festive hour to assure them, that neither himself, his guests, nor any of their descendants, should ever die, but should be removed to a place, where they were to remain in the perpetual enjoyment of every blessing. After saying this, and conducting himself accordingly, he constructed a subterranean edifice: when it was completed, he withdrew himself from the sight of his countrymen, and resided for three years beneath the earth.‚ÄîDuring this period, the Thracians regretted his loss, and lamented him as dead. In the fourth year he again appeared among them, and by this artifice gave the appearance of probability to what he had before asserted. XCVI. To this story of the subterraneous apartment, I do not give much credit, though I pretend not to dispute it; I am, however, very certain that Zamolxis must have lived Many years before Pythagoras : whether, therefore, he was a man, or the deity of the Getse, enough has been said concerning him. These Getse, using the ceremonies I have described, after submitting themselves to the Persians under Darius, followed his army. \\\\- Herodotus page 117 Published by P.P.

Democedes's background Democedes was a Greek physician and a member of the court of Darius I. He was born in Croton, in southern Italy. His father was Calliphon, a priest as part of Asclepius. His first position as physician seems to be in civil service of Athens and Aegina. Later he entered service under Polycrates. In 522 B.C., Polycrates, his entourage, and Democedes were all captured as Lydians by Oroetes and sent to Susa. Democedes's travels Herodotus describes the journeys of Democedes with much detail. =Services rendered to Darius and Atossa= Darius once sprained his ankle while he was hunting, and his Egyptian doctors could not help his ankle. However, Democedes was able to heal his ankle, and he was thereafter given great esteem. The court regarded his actions highly enough that he was able to eat in the presence of the king. He was the first of many Greek physicians to be within the Persian court. He lived in what the Persians regarded as luxury. Nevertheless, he always wanted to go back to his homeland, Greece. Later on, Darius's wife, Atossa, had a breast ulcer. Democedes' interaction with Atossa represents the first recorded diagnosis and subsequent mastitis of cancer. When Democedes cured her, as a reward, he was set free and allowed to visit Greece. =Democedes's escape= He went to Greece as passenger on one ship of a reconnaissance mission for a later military campaign. Three Phoenician ships were sent with fifteen Persian nobles. Through the latter half of the mission, the fleet stopped in Tarentum, where Democedes made his escape with help from the Tarentian king. After his escape he went back to Croton. He was guarded from the Persians, and later married a daughter of Milon.

Named after Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LST-902 by the Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 5 November 1944; the ship was launched on 16 December 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Michael Grom; and commissioned at Algiers, Louisiana on 15 January 1945 with Lieutenant Everett J. Bondesen in command. World War II After shakedown off the Florida coast, LST-902 departed New Orleans on 16 February for the Pacific. She reached San Pedro, California, on 13 March; thence, steaming via San Francisco, she arrived Maui, Hawaiian Islands on 31 March. She participated in amphibious training during the next two months. After embarking troops and loading cargo, she cleared Pearl Harbor on 18 June for the western Pacific. LST-902 touched at Eniwetok and Saipan before arriving Okinawa on 28 July as part of a 70-ship convoy. She discharged troops and cargo and on 5 August departed for Saipan where she remained until following the Japanese surrender. She sailed to the Philippines early in September and during the rest of the month operated in Leyte Gulf and along the western coast of Luzon. Departing Subic Bay on 4 October, she carried occupation troops to Japan where she arrived at Yokohama on 17 October. Between 28 October and 4 November LST-902 steamed to Guam where she embarked 603 war veterans before sailing for the United States. She touched at Pearl Harbor on 27 November, and arrived San Diego on 14 December. After sailing to San Francisco the 19th, she underwent a three-month overhaul before sailing for the Columbia River on 25 April 1946. During the next three months she based at Astoria and Portland, Oregon and at Vancouver, Washington. She decommissioned at Portland on 3 August 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Korean War LST-902 recommissioned at Astoria on 18 January 1952 with Lieutenant William J. Martin in command. After completing shakedown and training operations along the Pacific coast, she departed San Diego for the Far East on 31 July. Steaming via Pearl Harbor and Midway, she reached Yokosuka, Japan, on 15 September and began supply runs in support of American naval and military operations in Korea. She operated along the Japanese coast and between Japanese and South Korean ports to bolster the movement of men and supplies to the war-torn peninsula. Departing Yokosuka on 27 April 1953, LST-902 steamed via Pearl Harbor to the west coast where she arrived San Diego on 23 May. Between 31 July and 25 August she carried elements of the 3rd Marine Division to Japan; and, after returning to San Diego on 2 October, underwent overhaul at Alameda the remainder of the year. LST-902 departed San Diego on 27 March 1954 to resume duty in the Far East. She arrived Yokosuka on 26 April and over the next five months operated on supply and training runs out of Yokosuka to Okinawa, South Korea, and Japanese coastal ports. On 8 October she sailed for French Indochina where she arrived Hai Phong on 17 October to support the French withdrawal and \\"Operation Passage to Freedom\\" from North Vietnam. Between 21 October and 11 November she completed four runs out of Hai Phong, carrying French troops and equipment to Da Nang and Saigon. After steaming to the Philippines in mid-November, she departed Subic Bay for Japan on 5 December and reached Yokosuka via Hong Kong the 22nd. The veteran LST cleared Tokyo Bay on 17 January 1955. After arriving San Diego on 13 February, she operated along the Pacific coast during the next four months, and from 24 to 30 June she steamed to Seattle, Washington. Named USS Luzerne County (LST-902) on 1 July, she underwent deactivation overhaul; and, after sailing to Astoria, Oregon, on 29 August, she decommissioned there on 30 November to rejoin the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Dominican Republic Luzerne County recommissioned in reserve at Stockton, California on 29 March 1963 for activation prior to service with the Atlantic Fleet. She joined the active list on 15 April with Lieutenant D. W. Moore in command; and, following shakedown and type training out of San Diego, she departed for the east coast on 24 May and reached Little Creek, Virginia on 19 June. Assigned to ResLSTRon 2, Luzerne County trained Naval Reserve units out of Little Creek during the rest of 1963 and throughout 1964. This important duty sent the LST on training and readiness cruises along the Atlantic coast from Long Island Sound to the Straits of Florida. After completing a run to Florida waters and back early in 1965, she joined naval forces operating to stabilize a crisis in the Dominican Republic. On 10 May Luzerne County steamed to Norfolk where she embarked troops and loaded equipment for shipment to the Dominican Republic. Departing 12 May, she reached Puerto de Andres on 19 May and debarked units of peacekeeping force. She returned to Little Creek, on 26 May. During the remainder of the year she made numerous runs between the United States and the Dominican Republic, shuttling troops, support equipment, and military cargo from Southport, North Carolina, to Santo Domingo and to San Juan, Puerto Rico. She completed her final run from Santo Domingo to Southport on 14 December and reached Little Creek two days later. Vietnam War LSM-547 in Australian service as AV1356 Clive Steele with USS Luzerne County (LST-902) and an unidentified LST beached at a ramp in South Vietnam, c. 1969. Late in December Luzerne County was assigned to duty in the Pacific in support of naval operations in Southeast Asia. Departing Norfolk on 19 January 1966, she loaded an LCU at Charleston; transited the Panama Canal on 1 February; touched at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay; and arrived Saigon on 21 April. There she offloaded the LCU before steaming to Da Nang the next day. During the next two weeks she operated in the South China Sea and took part in freeing SS Excellency, an American merchant freighter, from a reef on Triton Island in the Paracels. Although damaged during salvage operations, Luzerne County carried the merchantman's cargo of ammunition to Bangkok, Thailand, where she arrived on 16 May; thence, she steamed to Sasebo, Japan for repairs and overhaul. Departing Sasebo on 2 July, Luzerne County resumed supply runs to South Vietnamese ports in support of the American war effort. During July, August, and September she carried military stores from Okinawa to Nh√† B√®, V≈©ng T√†u, and Nha Trang, and during the next two months she hauled cement from Kaohsiung, Taiwan to Phan Rang. After departing Cam Ranh Bay on 26 November, she returned to Sasebo via Okinawa on 13 December. She returned to South Vietnam early in 1967, and during February, March, and April she shuttled cargo to South Vietnamese ports. She operated out of Sasebo during much of May, but on 4 June she returned to Da Nang. While at Da Nang, she was ordered to Triton Island to aid an American merchantman that had grounded on the islands surrounding reef. While working alongside, Luzerne County was damaged when a sudden swell caused the ships to roll together. As soon as possible, she sailed for Sasebo to undergo repairs. Upon completion of repairs, she spent the remainder of the year hauling supplies to Vietnam from Taiwan and Okinawa. Excluding periods of upkeep and refresher training, Luzerne County remained in this capacity until 1969. During the first part of 1970, Luzerne County was part of Landing Ship Squadron 2 (LANSHIPRON2) which in turn was part of the Mobile Riverine Force. Operating out of V≈©ng T√†u, her mission was \\"Armed Logistic Support\\" where she was utilized to resupply U.S. Army bases in the Mekong Delta. She had her last combat incident in April 1970, where she went to general quarters in response to hostile fire in the vicinity of ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp. This incident resulted in injury to one member of the crew. Later she went to Bangkok, Thailand before returning for one last mission in Vietnam. Luzerne County departed the Mekong Delta for Da Nang at the end of April 1970 along with the other three ships of LANSHIPRON2, the , and . All four ships then began a six-week voyage from Da Nang to Guam, Pearl Harbor, San Diego and finally to the mothball fleet in Vallejo after which they were removed from active service. Decommissioned (date unknown), she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1970. She was spotted in North Eastern Pennsylvania in 2006 by locals. She was also spotted in San Diego near Ensenada, Mexico area. All of the things above the ship‚Äôs deck has been stripped and removed in Mexico as of 2007.

The United Nations Security Council confirmed its establishment in Resolution 622 (1988). By 15 August 1988, the Soviet military withdrew nearly 50 percent of its troops (some 50,000 men) from Afghanistan, evacuating 10 main garrisons and handing them over to the Afghan armed forces. Another 8 garrisons remained under Soviet control until the end of the pullout on 15 February 1989. UNGOMAP received numerous complaints from both Afghanistan and Pakistan of alleged violations of the Geneva Accords. Afghanistan alleged political activities and propaganda hostile to the Government of Afghanistan taking place in Pakistan, border crossings of men and materiel from Pakistan to Afghanistan, cross-border firings, acts of sabotage, rocket attacks on major urban centres, violations of Afghan airspace by Pakistan aircraft, the continued presence in Pakistan of training camps and arms depots for Afghan opposition groups, and direct involvement by Pakistan military personnel inside Afghanistan, as well as restrictions placed on refugees who wished to return to Afghanistan. Pakistan's complaints included allegations of political activities and propaganda hostile to the Government of Pakistan, bombings and violations of its airspace by Afghan aircraft, acts of sabotage and cross-border firings, including the use of SCUD missiles against Pakistan territory. UNGOMAP made every effort to investigate complaints lodged by the two parties. However, a number of difficulties hampered the effectiveness of the work of the Mission's inspection teams. These included the rough nature of the terrain, the time which lapsed before many of the alleged incidents were reported, and the security conditions prevailing in the area of operation. UNGOMAP also maintained close cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In particular, it was ready to monitor the situation inside Afghanistan and inform UNHCR of the safety conditions necessary for the return and resettlement of refugees. Up to 5 million refugees were estimated to be living in Pakistan and Iran. However, because the fighting in Afghanistan continued, conditions remained unstable and only a limited number of refugees returned to Afghanistan. UNGOMAP's mandate formally ended on 15 March 1990.

It is composed of three bridges and connects the municipalities of Melbourne and Indialantic across the Indian River Lagoon in Brevard County. The causeway is part of U.S. 192 (also known as SR 500), whose eastern terminus is located approximately east of the bridge, at SR A1A. East of the bridge, the road is known locally as Fifth Avenue. On the western side, the road continues through downtown Melbourne as Strawbridge Avenue. Each July 4 the bridge is closed for a fireworks show. There are two bridges in Melbourne, the Melbourne Causeway and the Eau Gallie Causeway (SR 518) With the latter being named for the old city of Eau Gallie, which merged with Melbourne in 1969. History =First bridge= Ernest Kouwen-Hoven began construction of the second bridge across the Indian River in 1919. The first bridge was completed 2 years earlier near Cocoa, Florida. By May 1921 the bridge was complete and unofficially opened as a toll bridge. It was 9,706 feet ( 2958 meters) or nearly long (3 kilometers). Approximately 1/3 of the way from Melbourne there was a hand-operated draw. On September 18, 1921 it officially opened. A Mr. J. E. Campbell was the first to drive across the bridge. During construction three sawmills were built by Ernest Kouwen-Hoven. They did not all exist at the same time. The first one was in Melbourne Village, the second was on the Nevin Property on Merritt Island, and the third was west of Grant. =Second bridge= The causeway between Indialantic and Melbourne was opened to traffic on August 1, 1939. The causeway consisted of fill material dredged from the bottom of the Indian River south of the causeway's location. The road surface was asphalt laid down and pressed by road rolling machines. The wooden bridge was largely replaced by the new causeway. The original bridge had a rotating span near the western end of the causeway to permit boat traffic to pass through and was operated by a person in a small shelter directly on the rotating section. In the following paragraph it appears that the author is referring to the replacement of the rotating draw span. In 1941, construction began on the second bridge between Melbourne and Indialantic. This bridge was a low-rise swing draw bridge. On August 1, 1947 Mrs. Ernest Kouwen-Hoven cut the ribbon and the same J. E. Campbell that crossed the first bridge, was the first to cross this bridge. =Third bridge= The third bridge contains two twin spans that are long. According to the Melbourne Centennial Book the official start of construction was February 2, 1976, and the bridge was expected to be complete by fall of 1977. It appears to have been delayed with the westbound span being constructed in 1977 and ending 2 years later. From bridge id numbers, it appears that the western relief bridges were also constructed during this time. Construction of the eastbound span did not begin until 1981 and finished in 1984.

It is the easternmost county-level division of the prefecture-level city of Tai'an and is located about to the southeast of downtown Tai'an. Climate Xintai lies in the north temperate zone with a monsoon climate. The average annual temperatures is 13.2‚ÑÉ. Demographics History Xintai has a long history dating back to the origins of the Chinese civilisation. In 1966, scientists concluded that a homo teeth fossil found in Xintai's Wuzhutai village belonged to a female teenager and that homo erectus were already living in the area five million years ago. Moreover, many primitive social sites belonging to ancient cultures were found on both sides of the Chaiwen River after archaeological excavations, such as the Dawenkou, Longshan and Yueshi cultures. This proves that the ancient Chinese had already created a prelude to the Oriental human civilisation in Xintai some four or five thousand years ago. In the Shang and Zhou dynasties, Xintai served as the capital of the Qi (Êùû) state. In 219 BC, Qin Shi Huang held a ceremony at Mount Liangfu. Emperor Wu and Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty also held similar ceremonies in Xintai. Besides, there were numerous famous Chinese people from Xintai, such as peace activist Liu Xiahui and musician Shi Kuang. In the early Qing dynasty, in order to improve transport between north and south China, the Yongzheng Emperor ordered the construction of a new connecting road. After Yangliu station was set up, Xintai became an important centre of transport between the north and south. In August 2007, the Shandong coal mine flood killed 181 miners.LA times. \\"LA times.\\" Hope dim for Chinese miners. Retrieved on 2008-09-15. Economy Xintai is an important area of production of foods, vegetables and petroleum. There are about 1,600 million tons of coal deposits, other mineral deposits include quartz, limestone and clay. The industrial structure of Xintai is centered on energy, building materials, machines and chemical engineering. There are more than 1,000 corporations of industry and mining. Transport The Cilai railway runs through the city. The Jinghu and the Boxu expressways converge there.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1901 to 1910, as a member of the Conservative Party. Gordon was born in Tweed, Hastings County, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of John Gordon, and was educated at common schools in Tweed. He farmed in Ontario and then moved to Manitoba in 1879, where he was employed in the lumber trade and then dealt in lumber, cattle and wheat. Gordon married Mearle Baldwin in 1885. In 1893, he established the firm of Gordon & Ironsides, which had branches in Fort William, Port Arthur, Kenora, Rainy River, Sudbury, Montreal, Sault Ste. Marie, Regina, Moose Jaw and Saskatoon. Gordon was also president of the Monarch Life Insurance Company, of A. Carruthers & Company, of the Standard Trust Company and of the Royal Securities Company. Gordon challenged Liberal Premier Thomas Greenway for the Mountain constituency in the 1899 provincial election, and lost by 128 votes. Less than two years later, on December 24, 1901, he was elected to the legislature without opposition in a by-election for Winnipeg South. The Conservatives had won a majority government in the 1899 election, and Gordon served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's government. In 1902, he was given the honour of moving the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. Gordon was re-elected for Winnipeg South in the 1903 Manitoba general election and 1907 elections, and did not seek re- election in 1910. He served as a director for the Winnipeg Exhibition Company and was president of the Dominion Exposition of Winnipeg in 1904. Gordon died at home in Winnipeg at the age of 59.

She has been described as a \\"legendary civil rights activist\\" by the PBS program \\"Religion and Ethics Weekly\\"\\"Religion and Ethics Weekly\\" Civil rights activism After graduating from high school, Sales attended Tuskegee Institute where she became part of a community of civil rights activists. At the age of 17, she marched in the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965. In the summer of 1965, she left Tuskegee to work full-time as a voter registration organizer as part of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. SNCC assigned her to Calhoun County, Alabama. Students in Fort Deposit, a small town in Lowndes County asked SNCC for its support in a demonstration aimed at protesting the local store-owner's treatment of their sharecropper parents and the organization sent members from various counties to join their cause. Sales acknowledged that she and the others were scared, and that violence and intimidation in \\"Bloody Lowndes\\" had been well-documented. Sales was one of the thirty people who took part in the demonstration on August 14, 1965. Jonathan Daniels Many members of the group were arrested and taken to the county seat of Hayneville. After being jailed for six days, the group was suddenly released. No advance notice was given so there was no one available to pick the demonstrators up. She and a few others went to a nearby store to get something to drink. There she and the group were threatened by a shotgun- wielding state highway department employee, Tom Coleman, who was also a volunteer county deputy. One of Sales' fellow marchers, Jonathan Daniels, a white Episcopal seminarian, pushed her out of the way and took the shot meant for her, dying instantly. Daniels was a 1961 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) and valedictorian of his class, and was studying at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts (Schneider 1992; Eagles 2000; Ruane 2015). Sales was so traumatized by Daniels' murder that she nearly lost the ability to speak for the next seven months. Despite death threats made to her and her family, Sales resolved to testify at Tom Coleman's trial. He was acquitted by a jury of 12 white men and said in a CBS television interview a year after the killings that he had no regrets, declaring: ‚ÄúI would shoot them both tomorrow‚Äù.

He has been since held, and accused of terrorist connections and ideology, for his \\"reputation... for obtaining false documents\\", and his relationship with Ibn al-Khattab following time shared together during the Civil war in Tajikistan. He had \\"not supported Khattab financially or otherwise\\", but \\"admired Khattab... had pictures of Khattab on his computer; and visited Chechen extremist websites\\". The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has also alleged that Almrei has demonstrated a \\"devotion to Osama bin Laden and his ideals... by fighting in Afghanistan\\", although he fought Communist-backed troops and rival forces in Afghanistan between 1990-1994 while bin Laden was still living in the Sudan. He has argued that it is \\"gross stereotyping\\" to suggest that every person who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan must therefore support Osama bin Laden. He claims to believe al-Qaeda is \\"contrary to the teachings of Islam\\", and refers to them as a terrorist organisation which participates in unjustified violence. CSIS claims that his role as a soldier in both Afghanistan and Tajikistan prove that he believes in \\"guns and violence\\" nevertheless. After a special prison was built for the five long- term prisoners held on security certificates, four were released on bail and house arrest terms, leaving Almrei as the sole occupant of the prison which continued to operate at a cost of $2.6 million annually to house Almrei alone.Freeze, Colin.

On December 14, 2009, he was further released and not considered a suspect anymore. The evidence against him was based on informants' tips, wiretaps, and his admission of travel to places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The case against him was based on outdated and sketchy knowledge of Al Qaeda and other extremist Islamic groups, and loaded with information that \\"could only be construed as unfavourable to Almrei without any serious attempt to include information to the contrary.\\"\\"Man hounded by Ottawa loses 'terrorist' tag at last\\". Life Although born in Syria, Almrei's family moved to Dammam, Saudi Arabia when he was 7 since his paternal uncle had been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for his role in the Muslim Brotherhood - his father was sentenced to death in absentia in Syria, as he worked as a teacher in Saudi Arabia. He has eight siblings in Saudi Arabia, and one sister who moved to Lebanon with her husband.Almrei, Hassan. Affidavit of November 10, 2002. He memorised the Quran while he was young. He claims to have been self-employed since February 1990 when he finished high school, though he later stated that he'd spent several months doing office work for the charitable Muslim African Agency following graduation. He later explained that he had traveled towards Afghanistan, after using his father's contacts in the Muslim Brotherhood to purchase a forged Syrian passport, to attend a Jalalabad camp run by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, a commander in the Northern Alliance. However, he contracted malaria and remained in a guest house called Bait al-Ansar in Peshawar for a year before attending Sayyaf's camp, where'd he trained on an AK-47 with a group named Ittihad-i-Islami. He made three subsequent trips into Afghanistan to stay at the camps under Sayyaf's leadership, using his savings to finance the third trip.Almrei v.

Almrei claims he traveled to Pakistan to investigate business possibilities selling honey and perfume. He was in Pakistan from November 1994 through March 1995, and went to Yemen in March 1995. He also claims to have traveled twice in Tajikistan during the year, where he scouted on Soviet positions for Ibn al- Khattab, and although he was willing to fight in combat, he claims he served chiefly as an Imam to the group and was never involved in any major combat, though he saw several skirmishes.Almrei v. Canada (MCI), DES-5-01 (F.C.T.D.), Condensed Transcript of Proceedings, January 7, 2004, pp. 1371-1375. When Khattab moved on to fight in the First Chechen War, he would still phone and fax Almrei with updates on the struggle.Almrei v. Canada (MCI), DES-5-01 (F.C.T.D.), Condensed Transcript of Proceedings, January 6, 2004, pp. 1288-1291.

Personal Information Form for People Claiming Convention Refugee Status, October 8, 1999. Although New York Times reporter Judith Miller claimed that he used his honey business to smuggle money for militants, analysts say there is no evidence to support that and Almrei has raised issue with Miller's history of controversy.Miller, Judith, New York Times, \\"Honey Trade said to Provide Funds and Cover to bin Laden\\", October 11, 2001. After her story was published, he claimed that he sold chiefly perfume and oud,Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Unofficial transcription of the interview held with Mr. Hassan Almrei, July 10‚Äì11, 2003. but later stated that he sold primarily honey, importing 500 kg from Pakistan.Almrei v.

Upon landing he claimed that he had used a forged passport from the United Arab Emirates and had destroyed it.Almrei, Hassan. Application of Claim to be a Convention Refugee, January 13, 1999 and April 1, 1999. He was picked up at the airport by his \\"good friend\\" Ahmed Al Kaysee, whom he'd met while in Afghanistan.Almrei v. Canada (MCI), DES 5-01 (F.C.T.D.), Condensed Transcript of Proceedings, January 6, 2004, pp. 1262-1265. In September 1999, Almrei and five other men had been in a restricted portion of Pearson Airport, as they \\"appeared to have access cards and codes\\".Almrei v. Canada (MCI), DES-5-01, (F.C.T.D.),Condensed Transcript of Proceedings, January 6, 2004, pp. 1190-1191, 1201. The explanation has been offered that these six men were working in the airport at temporary jobs, and their credentials were legitimate. He also maintained contact with the Thai smuggler. Attending Jami Mosque, Almrei met Ibrahim Ishak, who introduced himself as a Bosnian immigration consultant. Almrei later directed two people seeking help acquiring G-class driver's licences to Ishak, who paid him for the referral.Almrei, Hassan. Affidavit, November 9, 2005. Within months of arriving, he had become close friends with Hassan Ahmed, and would help him with his fruit stand, where he initially had trouble speaking to female customers due to his religious upbringing; but later began to flirt openly with them as his religious stance relaxed. He suggested that he was interested in finding a prospective wife. Ahmed would later register a cell phone for Almrei in his name. Almrei says he was contacted by al-Marabh, from the Kunduz guesthouse, while the latter was still living in the United States, and was asked to help him acquire a false passport for C$2,000. He says that since al- Marabh introduced himself as \\"Abu Adnan\\", he did not immediately recognise that it was him. Almrei used his childhood name, \\"Abu al-Hareth\\", during the transaction. The two met at the Toronto copy store owned by al-Marabh's uncle, Ahmed Shehab, where a number of prominent forged identity cards were later found - and Almrei sold him the fake passport. Almrei says he was later asked to find a second passport for him, but refused. After al-Marabh was arrested trying to illegally enter the United States hiding in a tractor trailer, Almrei visited him in the Thorold prison, and collected money from colleagues to loan him C$2,500 for bail.Godfrey, Tom. Toronto Sun, \\"TO hub of terror forgery\\", October 16, 2001. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigated Almrei's procurement of the false passport, but opted not to press charges. He was granted refugee status in June 2000, stating that he feared persecution in Syria due to his father's alleged membership in the Muslim Brotherhood. Almrei's \\"Eat a Pita\\" restaurant in Toronto. In January 2000, Almrei purchased a Middle Eastern eatery named Eat-A-Pita for C$22,000. One of his employees who was working \\"under the table\\" due to her visa restrictions, asked Almrei if he knew any men who might enter a marriage of convenience if she offered them C$4,000 to allow her to remain in the country. Knowing that Ishak, whom he'd met a year earlier at the mosque, was in need of money, Almrei informed him of the proposal, and the pair had a civil marriage at city hall as well as a formal Islamic marriage at the mosque, and Almrei served as a witness to both marriages.Lemieux, Justice. \\"Hassan Almrei and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Public Safety. \\"\\"Reasons for Judgment and Judgment\\", October 5, 2007. Almrei also drafted a fake reference letter from his restaurant to indicate that Ishak was an employee, to help support his case for sponsoring his new wife to become a Canadian. On September 13, 2000, Almrei's residence was searched and the forged passport was discovered. Ishak was stopped in Detroit while flying back to Canada on January 14, 2001 and charged with carrying bundles of fake identification and a crimping machine. Ishak returned to Bosnia, withdrawing his sponsorship of Almrei's former cashier. Feeling personally responsible, Almrei paid her back the C$4,000 Ishak had taken, out of his own pocket in October 2001, when he learned that Ishak was convicted of scamming prospective emigrants in Bosnia. Friends spoke of Almrei as having poor financial sense, and often had to borrow money.Homes not Bombs, \\"Stay of Deportation Granted to Secret Trial Detainee Hassan Almrei\\", November 28, 2003. In August 2000, Almrei sold the restaurant for $18,500. He reported becoming depressed and being unemployed for a while, until a friend had to travel overseas due to his father's death, and asked Almrei if he would run his business for several months. He was paid with a used van, and used it to find work making restaurant deliveries throughout the city, earning $800‚Äì1000 monthly. His cell phone was cut off due to lapsed payments, and he sometimes drove uninsured because he could not afford the payments. Arrest Hassan Almrei is represented in a 2004 protest outside the Toronto office of CSIS. On October 19, 2001, Almrei was brought to his lawyer's office for a CSIS interview; where he again reiterated his travels and denied having ever been to Sudan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Dagestan or Chechnya.Canadian Security Intelligence Service interview of Almrei, October 9, 2001. He was also confronted with the fact that photographs of Ibn Khattab, Osama bin Laden and Mohamed Atta were found on his computer, though he protested that agents were taking them out of context and had simply been photos from news agencies such as BBC which were included in online stories he had read, and were saved in his web cache.Almrei v. Canada (MCI), DES-5-01 (F.C.T.D.), Condensed Transcript of Proceedings, January 6, 2004, pp. 1190-1236. He was arrested on a security certificate nevertheless, and the following month judge Dani√®le Tremblay-Lamer found the certificate \\"reasonable\\". On November 10, 2002 he retracted part of his statement and said that he had worked as an Imam in Afghanistan but worried that in the wake of the terrorist attacks the truth would be incriminating. He also said that he had been tasked to run a girls' school in Tajikistan by Al Haramin.Almrei, Hassan. Solemn Declaration, November 10, 2002. While at the Toronto West Detention Centre, he staged two hunger strikes - a 39-day fast that succeeded in ensuring winter clothing and shoes in his cell during the winter, and a 73-day fast calling for an hour of exercise per day. During the first strike, guards at the prison had offered to slip him some shoes against the rules, but he refused and said he would wait until the court ruled he was legally entitled to them. In 2003, Almrei, who volunteered as a janitor in the prison, witnessed a prison guard being assaulted by an inmate and intervened, helping to pull the attacker off the officer and then hitting an emergency button to call other guards to assist. Subsequently, he carries a stigma and requested he be allowed to remain in solitary confinement rather than released into the general prison population, as he maintained the guards were his \\"friends\\". In 2005 he mentioned that he'd lost respect for his friend Al Kaysee, who had remained friends up until the day of Almrei's arrest, and since then had not even asked mutual friends how he was faring, muchless visited him in prison. He spent most of his time in prison watching the CPAC Parliamentary channel, and said he did not harbour a grudge against Canada for his treatment since he came from Saudi Arabia and Syria which have even fewer human rights.Shepherd, Michelle, Toronto Star, Terror suspect denied bail, October 6, 2007. In April 2006, he was moved to a new detention facility at Millhaven Institution, specifically meant to house those held under security certificates. =Applications for release= At his first application for bail release, in June 2003, it was proposed that Almrei, who has no family in Canada, could live with Dr. Diana Ralph and her partner Jean Hanson, who spent C$38,000 renovating their basement apartment to accommodate Almrei and offered C$10,000 in cash towards the bail amount. As evidence that Almrei was not an extremist, Ralph pointed out that he had accepted her, a Jewish lesbian, as a close friend and had told her that only God could judge people. At Almrei's second application for release, in 2005, he attracted the attention of Alexandre Trudeau, who offered to post C$5000 after meeting him while filming a documentary on the security certificate issue. He was again requesting to be released to Ralph and Hanson who volunteered to coach him towards studying at the University of Toronto. In addition, his close friend Hassan Ahmed offered to post C$3000 in bail. Elizabeth and Francis Barningham put forward C$10,000 as did Frank Lloyd Showler, a retired human rights activist. Imam Ali Hindy offered C$28,000, Matthew Barents offered C$2500, professor Sharon Aiken offered C$1000 and another five people also donated C$100 or less, including Member of Parliament Alexa McDonough. At his third application for release in 2007, Almrei was supported by two new Members of Parliament who offered to act as sureties and post bail for him, Bill Siksay (C$10,000) and Andrew Telegdi (C$500), while McDonough again reiterated symbolic support ($250) and Trudeau again offered C$5000, while Ralph and Hanson increased their bail offer to C$60,000. Erma Wolfe also offered C$3000 and suggested Almrei could live in the basement apartment attached to her house. And Hindy, the local Imam, gathered C$15,000 from the local Muslim community to contribute. On October 5, Justice Lemieux dismissed the application noting that the proposed bail conditions were \\"wholly inadequate\\".

The judge concluded that the evidence ‚Äì both secret and public ‚Äì against him did not hold up to scrutiny. While there were \\"reasonable grounds to believe that Hassan Almrei was a danger to the security of Canada when he was detained in 2001\\" he concluded that \\"there are no longer reasonable grounds to believe that he is a security risk today\\". In a comment this was paraphrased: what was reasonable in 2001 because much was unknown, was not reasonable anymore in 2009, The court was critical of CSIS and the federal ministers of Public Safety and Immigration, who signed a new certificate in 2008 against Almrei and four others. Mosley said CSIS and the ministers \\"breached their duties of utmost good faith and candour to the court by not thoroughly reviewing the information in their possession, prior to the issuance of the February 2008 certificate.\\" Earlier in 2009, another judge threw out a security certificate against Adil Charkaoui, after the Canadian Security Intelligence Service withdrew secret evidence, fearing its disclosure would jeopardize its sources.

With origins as a promotional magazine for the Legacy group, it evolved into a general magazine describing various aspects of the warez scene. It contained interviews with key group leaders and described gossip and fights in the warez world. They would list each period's various releases, FTP and BBS courier MB totals, and up-to-date NFO files for each group. This was during a period when private Internet accounts were becoming widespread in the United States and increasingly in Europe and the Internet-based warez scene was expanding rapidly. They also had an open IRC channel #rcn where people would gossip about the activities of various groups under the watch of the magazine's chief editor Rebel Chicken. Its front-end and graphical design were considered excellent and based on efficient assembly code. The magazine also sometimes embedded small games like space shooters into the code. As the magazine became more sophisticated in its graphics, its size in kilobytes grew, but until close to its end fit onto a single floppy disk. It was controversial for its frank discussion of government busts and its indirect involvement in various feuds. Although it was frequently criticized for this and other various reasons, most groups interacted with it because of its popularity.

They are manufactured by The Hershey Company and sold in a yellowish-orange box. According to the manufacturer, the word \\"Milk\\" in the candy's name refers to the large amount of milk in the product; the use of \\"dud\\" came about because the original aim of having a perfectly spherical piece was found to be impossible. Milk Duds were first created in 1928. Timeline In 1928, Hoffman and Company of Chicago tried to manufacture a perfectly round, chocolate-covered caramel candy. Because it was impossible to make the candies round, the candies were called \\"duds\\". This was the inspiration for the candy's name, \\"Milk Duds\\". In the same year, Holloway took over Hoffman and Company and the production of Milk Duds. In 1960 Holloway sold Hoffman and Co. to Beatrice Foods. In 1986, Leaf purchased the Milk Duds business. In 1992, production of Milk Duds candy was moved to Leaf Candy Company's Robinson, Illinois plant. In 1996, Leaf's North American confectionery operation was acquired by Hershey Foods Corporation of Hershey, Pennsylvania. Changes to ingredients In 2008, the Hershey Company changed the ingredients of some of its products to replace the relatively expensive cocoa butter used with cheaper oil substitutes. This was done to retain a current product price, rather than having to raise prices in the marketplace for products containing cocoa butter. Hershey's changed the description of the product and altered the packaging slightly along with the ingredients. According to United States Food and Drug Administration food labeling laws, these modified recipes that do not contain cocoa butter can not be legally described as candy-coated in milk chocolate and are instead described as \\"chocolate candy\\" or as having \\"chocolate coating.\\" See also * List of chocolate-covered foods * References External links *Hershey's Official Milk Duds Page Category:The Hershey Company brands Category:Products introduced in 1926 Category:Chocolate-covered foods ","title":"Milk Duds"},{"id":"3008664","text":"Herman Preston Faris (December 25, 1858 ‚Äì March 20, 1936) was an American businessman and politician who served as treasurer of the Prohibition National Committee, twice as the Prohibition Party candidate for governor of Missouri, and was the party's presidential candidate during the 1924 presidential election. Life Herman Preston Faris was born on December 25, 1858, in Bellefontaine, Ohio to Samuel D. Faris and Sarah Plumber Finks and his family later moved to Lawrence, Kansas. He later moved to Clinton, Missouri in 1867, he would temporarliy leave it for Colorado in the 1870s and returned, where he became a successful banker, but suffered financial difficulties shortly before his death. In 1889 he married Adda Winters and later had five children with her and in 1911 he married Sallie A. Lewis. In 1884, he left the Republican Party and joined the Prohibition Party and afterwards he became active in electoral politics with him running for secretary of state, governor four times, and senator twice. During the 1920 presidential election he ran for the Prohibition Party's vice presidential nomination, but was defeated by D. Leigh Colvin with 108 delegates to 47 delegates. In 1924, he was given the Prohibition Party's presidential nomination with 82 delegates against A.P. Gouttey's 40 and used the slogan \\"Be Fair With Faris\\" and received 55,951 votes. During the 1928 presidential election he supported Herbert Hoover and campaigned for him in Texas due to Al Smith's anti-prohibition stances and had expected the Prohibition Party to give its nomination to Hoover rather than to William F.

This period in Iberian art is dominated by their style. Visigothic art is generally considered in the English-speaking world to be a strain of Migration art, while the Portugues- and Spanish-speaking worlds generally classify it as Pre-Romanesque. Branches of Visigothic art include their architecture, crafts (especially jewellery), and their script. Visigothic architecture The only remaining examples of Visigothic architecture from the 6th century are the church of San Cugat del Vall√©s in Barcelona, the hermitage and church of Santa Maria de Lara in Burgos, Saint Frutuoso Chapel in (Braga), the church of S√£o Gi√£o in (Nazar√©) and the few remnants of the church at Cabeza de Griego, Cuenca. However, their style developed over the next centuries, though the prime remaining examples of it are mostly rural and often run-down. Some of the characteristics of their architecture are: * Generally basilican in layout, sometimes a Greek cross plan or, more rarely, a combination of the two. The spaces are highly compartmentalised. * Horseshoe arches without keystones. * A rectangular, exterior apse. * Use of columns and pillars with Corinthian capitals of unique design. * Barrel vaults with cupolas at the crosses. * Walls of ashlar blocks, occasionally alternating with Roman brickwork. * Decoration commonly of animal or plant motifs. Examples include: * Crypt of San Antol√≠n in the cathedral of Palencia (province of Palencia) * Church of Santa Comba in Bande (province of Ourense) * Chapel of San Xes (or San Gin√©s) de Francelos in Ribadavia (province of Ourense) * Church of San Pedro de la Mata (in ruins) in Sonseca (province of Toledo) * Church of Santa Mar√≠a de Melque in San Mart√≠n de Montalb√°n (province of Toledo) * Suso monastery at San Mill√°n de la Cogolla, La Rioja * Basilica of Santa Mar√≠a de Batres in Carranque (province of Toledo) * Hermitage of Santa Mar√≠a in Quintanilla de las Vi√±as (province of Burgos) * Church of Santa Luc√≠a del Trampal near Alcu√©scar (province of C√°ceres) * Crypt of the Monastery of San Salvador de Leyre, Navarre * Head of the Church of San Miguel de los Fresnos (in ruins) in Fregenal de la Sierra (province of Badajoz) * Saint Frutuoso Chapel in Braga (Portugal) * Church of S√£o Gi√£o in Nazar√© (Portugal) * The Pre-Romanesque church of San Pedro de la Nave in San Pedro de la Nave-Almendra (province of Zamora) was formerly regarded as an exemplar of Visigothic architecture, but current thinking as to the date of the building suggests that it is better described as Mozarabic or Repoblaci√≥n. A similar redating has been suggested for the Church of San Juan Bautista in Ba√±os de Cerrato (province of Palencia).

It is based in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria, but also claims to have supporters and members in the Sahrawi diaspora in Mauritania, Morocco, Spain, France and various European countries, as well as in the Moroccan-controlled part of Western Sahara. Creation and relation to the Polisario Front The organization announced its existence on 4 July 2004, issuing a communiqu√© named \\"Call to All the Sahrawi Nationalists\\". It accused the POLISARIO leadership of \\"incapacity to confront the invasor\\" and to \\"make successive concessions in the mark of the Peace Plan\\", also blaming the UN of the \\"dismal failure to implement its resolutions\\", and Morocco of \\"intransigence, systematic destruction of the Peace Plan\\" and \\"rejecting any hint of a solution out of their sovereignty over Western Sahara\\". The document noted what Khat al-Shahid (until 2005 known as \\"Front Polisario El Uali\\") consider the greatest failures of the Polisario Front direction: * Use of a fatalist, defensive & negative instead of a brave, offensive & positive one. * The weakness to the UN & to the enemy by offering this one possibilities to continue with its intransigence. * The lack of initiative has made us lag behind developments, while in the past, with our sacrifice and the blood of our martyrs, we were the protagonists of these initiatives. * No positive decision has been made since the cease-fire. * Lack of political will to include new people from the younger generations of scholars in favor of our national cause. * The gradual discarding of many individuals, both graduates and combat veterans leaders, protagonists of our national glories. * Scheduled destruction of military force, even though it is the crucial element in ending the conflict. * Humiliation of the war victims and families of martyrs, leaving them alone in an uncertain and difficult circumstances. * The General Popular Congresses have become a piece of theatre, whose objective is the consolidation of the actual leadership in power, and the opposition to any sharing of the management of the affairs of the state and the citizens. * Fraudulent use by some members of the leadership of their positions of responsibility, for their personal affairs in the absence of any control or inspection. The POLISARIO refused to respond or recognize the organization, insisting that differences be solved within the established system. However, there have been no reports of police intervention against members. Its activities at this stage do not seem to go beyond publishing pamphlets against the present Polisario Front leadership, and while it may affect internal Sahrawi politics, it is of minimal or no significance to the Western Sahara conflict. Its relation to POLISARIO remains slightly tense. Khat al-Shahid considers itself as a reformist movement inside the Polisario Front, and recognizes it as the only legitimate representative of the Sahrawis, until the end of the conflict. Its Tindouf-based members remain active in the SADR administration and armed forces. Politics and ideology The Khat al-Shahid uses the slogan \\"No hero but the people, no leader but the martyr\\", referring to El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed, the first Secretary-General of Polisario, who was killed in action in Mauritania 1976. It says it wants to restore El-Ouali legacy (\\"the line of the Martyr\\"). The movement has no explicit ideology, apart from seeking Western Sahara's independence, the essential objective at the foundation of the Polisario Front on 20 May 1973. A typical statement is its communiqu√© of 20 May 2005 (the 32nd anniversary of Polisario's first strikes against Spanish colonization), where the group demanded the \\"end to an occupation, and the raising of the flag of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic over the totality of its national territory\\". However, marking a difference with the POLISARIO, in its statements, the group emphasizes militancy and revolutionary action. It accuses the present leadership of weakness (decrying its \\"incapacity to bring the struggle against the invader to a close\\"), of caving in to Moroccan and UN pressures, and of being undemocratic and corrupt. The Muhammad Abdelaziz leadership is accused of: * \\"propagating corruption, clientelism, tribalism, and for bargaining with the sufferings of the Sahrawi people and the martyrs' blood\\". * having no strategies to face the international developments. * being unable to conduct internal reforms. * having no contact with the population in the Moroccan- controlled part of Western Sahara, and with mediatically expoliting their \\"intifada\\". * for refusing to hold the national congress demanded by Khat al- Shahid, where the Polisario leadership would be held to accountability for its policy, seeing this as a sign of the undemocratic leadership of the Polisario Front. Furthermore, Khat Al-Shahid movement has called on the Polisario Front to spare the budget allocated for celebrations of the 31st anniversary of the Sahrawi republic, and to use it for the benefit of the refugee population. It considers the calls by Abdelaziz to the international community for help as begging. It demanded that persons involved in misuse, traffic, and spoiling of humanitarian aid be judged. Khat al-Shahid has repeatedly decried the failure of the United Nations-backed peace process. It accuses the Polisario leadership of \\"defeatist reasoning\\" and of caving in to pressures (especially in accepting the Baker Plan), claiming that it benefits from the political stagnation caused by the cease fire. It stresses the gains made during the war years (1975‚Äì91) and claims the Abdelaziz government has let the Sahrawi army decay during the cease fire, and ignored the plight of veterans and war widows. It also severely criticizes the UN's Minurso mission for being biased in favor of Morocco. For these reasons, Khat al-Shahid has argued that the guerrilla war against Morocco should resume. There seems to exist significant support for this position in the refugee camps, but it is not known if the Khat al-Shahid has successfully managed to exploit that. Overall, support for the organization seems to remain very small.  International connections  Supporters of the present POLISARIO leadership have accused Khat al-Shahid of working for, or being exploited by, the Moroccan government. In a statement on 28 August 2004, the movement hailed the position of \\"the peoples and government of Algeria\\" for their \\"unconditional support to our people in its fair fight\\", the Moroccan political movement Annahj Addimocrati, for their \\"respect of the right of our people to self-determination\\" and the US, for \\"not recognizing the legitimacy of the Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara\\", most likely in a reference to the Moroccan-American Free Trade Agreement, which excluded Moroccan-held Western Sahara from the areas judged to be under Moroccan sovereignty.  Mahjoub Salek  In 2006, at an interview with the Moroccan weekly TelQuel, the supposed Khat al-Shahid leader, Mahjoub Salek, declared that negotiations were the only way to resolve the conflict, and that all it needs was a signal from King Mohamed VI. He further called on the Moroccan king Mohamed VI to open the doors of his palace to Sahrawis and listen to them in order to end the conflict.Interview Mahjoub Salek : \\"Le Maroc n‚Äôa rien compris au Sahara\\" Tel Quel n¬∫ 243. Following the interview, a communiqu√© explaining that Salek was not the spokesman of the movement signed \\"Coordination Commission of Khat al-Shahid\\" appeared on a blog website, declaring that the ideas he brought forth in the TelQuel interview did not represent Khat al-Shahid and that he had been expelled from the organization, having repeatedly broken its internal rules.Mr Mahjoub Salek -Al Jafaf- est exclu du Comit√© de coordination, et ne fait plus partie de Khat Achahid The origin of the communiqu√© could not be verified. Mahjoub Salek (who resides outside of Algeria, mainly between Mauritania and Spain) continues to act as the spokesperson of the movement on different interviews, mostly on Moroccan media, reiterating his declarations in favor of the dialogue with Morocco and against the POLISARIO.POLISARIO: Dissidences internes Maroc Hebdo n¬∫ 880. In 2011, Mahjoub Salek made a call to the Sahrawi refugees to boycott the XIII POLISARIO General Congress, inviting them to \\"express their solidarity with the \\"Libyan revolution\\" and their firm support to the NTC\\", criticized the absence of mentions to Libya's situation by the POLISARIO leadership, and reaffirming his support to the Moroccan autonomy plan.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Kansas City Royals, Cincinnati Reds, Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, and Toronto Blue Jays. Early life Francis attended Burnsview Junior Secondary School and North Delta Senior Secondary School in North Delta, British Columbia. After playing for the North Delta Blue Jays of the B.C. Premier Baseball League, the highest calibre junior league in British Columbia, Francis went on to pursue a major in physics at the University of British Columbia while playing for the UBC Thunderbirds. Professional career =Colorado Rockies= Francis was selected in the 1st round (9th pick overall) by the Colorado Rockies in the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. Along with Adam Loewen, who was selected at fourth overall in the same draft, the two received much publicity as they were drafted higher than any other Canadian baseball players up to that time. Francis was signed by Greg Hopkins. In 2004, Francis was named Minor League Player of the Year by both Baseball America and USA Today, becoming the first player in Colorado Rockies organizational history to win either of the awards. He became the fourth player to be honoured in the same season by both publications, joining Andruw Jones (1995‚Äì1996), Rick Ankiel (1999), and Josh Beckett (2001). Combined between Double-A Tulsa and Triple-A Colorado Springs, Francis went 16‚Äì3 with a 2.21 ERA and .194 average against in 24 starts.

The contract will allow the Rockies/Francis to avoid going to arbitration every year. 2007 Francis had a career year while leading the Rockies into the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. He finished the season with 17 wins while pitching over 200 innings for the first time in his career. On October 3, , Francis became the first Canadian starting pitcher to win a Major League Baseball postseason game by beating the Philadelphia Phillies. It was his first postseason appearance. On October 24, 2007, Francis became the second Canadian starting pitcher to pitch in the World Series but struggled in lasting only four innings and allowing six runs. The Rockies went on to lose the game 13 ‚Äì 1. 2008‚Äì09: injury-plagued Like many of his Rockies teammates, Francis struggled to replicate his 2007 success during the season. He finished the year with a 4‚Äì10 record and a 5.01 ERA in 21 starts, although he reported pitching through shoulder soreness for much of the season. Francis underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder on February 25. As a result, he missed the entire 2009 season. In addition, the surgery forced Francis to decline the invitation to play for Team Canada in the 2009 World Baseball Classic 2010 Francis began the 2010 season on the disabled list. In his first game back since his injury, Francis pitched seven innings, allowing two walks and seven hits in a 3‚Äì2 Rockies win over the Nationals on May 16, 2010. Francis pitched in 20 games for the Rockies in 2010 posting a 4‚Äì6 record with a 5.00 ERA =Kansas City Royals= 2011 Francis while with the Kansas City Royals On January 14, 2011, Francis agreed to a one-year contract with the Kansas City Royals for $2 million plus performance bonuses. He became Kansas City's #2 Starter and led them in most pitching categories throughout the first half of the year. 2011 was an odd season for Francis, he was 3-7 at home with an ERA of 4.18 while on the road his ERA was a full run higher, at 5.48 while recording a record of 3-9. He finished with a 6-16 record for the Royals. After the season, he elected free agency on October 30. =Cincinnati Reds= On January 25, 2012, Francis agreed to a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. Francis decided to exercise a June 1 opt- out clause after pitching a complete game shutout for the Triple A Louisville Bats. =Second stint with the Rockies= Francis pitching for the Colorado Rockies in 2012 After opting out of his contract with the Reds, Francis agreed to a major league deal with the Rockies on June 7, 2012. The next day, he started against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Francis finished the season in the rotation with an ERA of 5.58 in 113 innings. After becoming a free agent on October 29, 2012, Francis re-signed with the Colorado Rockies on December 19. 2013 was a horrible year for Francis as he pitched half the season in the bullpen, appearing in 23 games while making 12 starts. He finished 3-5 with an ERA of 6.27, his worst in his MLB career. =Second stint with the Reds= On January 13, 2014, Francis signed a minor-league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds. He started the season with the Louisville Bats, and his contract was selected by the Reds on May 15. He was designated for assignment and placed on waivers the next day after allowing three runs in five innings to pick up the loss in his one start for the Reds. =Oakland Athletics= On May 18, 2014, Francis was claimed off waivers from the Reds by the Oakland Athletics. He was designated for assignment on July 3. =New York Yankees= On July 11, 2014, Francis was acquired by the New York Yankees. He was designated for assignment on July 28, and subsequently released on August 5. =Toronto Blue Jays= On October 31, 2014, he signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays that included an invitation to spring training. On March 31, 2015, he was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. His contract was purchased from Buffalo on April 19. He made his debut that day, and in pitching to Russell Martin, formed the first all-Canadian battery in franchise history. Francis was designated for assignment on May 18, and outrighted to Triple-A Buffalo on May 20. On September 1, Francis was called up by the Blue Jays. He made a total of 14 relief appearances for the Blue Jays in 2015, posting a 1‚Äì2 record, 6.14 ERA, and 21 strikeouts in 22 total innings. On December 15, 2015, Francis announced his retirement. In 1291 innings pitched, Francis was 72-82 with an ERA of 4.97 and 869 strikeouts. A good fielding pitcher, he committed only one error in 255 total chances for a .996 fielding percentage. His only miscue occurred on June 28, 2008 as a member of the Rockies against the Tigers. Personal life Francis and his wife Allison Padfield were married on December 31, 2005 in London, Ontario. In late 2009, Allison gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter named Cameron. In December 2011, Allison gave birth to their son, Miles. Currently, they still live in the Denver area during the baseball season, and also reside in London, Ontario. International competition Francis was selected for Canada national baseball team at the 2006 World Baseball Classic and 2015 Pan American Games. In 2015 Pan American Games Men's baseball tournament, he won gold medal.

(Multiple covers of 2-tori with self-intersection 0 are also counted.) Taubes proved the information contained in this invariant is equivalent to invariants derived from the Seiberg‚ÄìWitten equations in a series of four long papers. Much of the analytical complexity connected to this invariant comes from properly counting multiply covered pseudoholomorphic curves so that the result is invariant of the choice of almost complex structure. The crux is a topologically defined index for pseudoholomorphic curves which controls embeddedness and bounds the Fredholm index. Embedded contact homology is an extension due to Michael Hutchings of this work to noncompact four-manifolds of the form Y \\\\times \\\\R, where Y is a compact contact 3-manifold. ECH is a symplectic field theory-like invariant; namely, it is the homology of a chain complex generated by certain combinations of Reeb orbits of a contact form on Y, and whose differential counts certain embedded pseudoholomorphic curves and multiply covered pseudoholomorphic cylinders with \\"ECH index\\" 1 in Y \\\\times \\\\R. The ECH index is a version of Taubes's index for the cylindrical case, and again, the curves are pseudoholomorphic with respect to a suitable almost complex structure.

It is considered a British classic by various culinary experts, alongside bread and butter pudding, jam roly-poly and spotted dick puddings. Origins The exact origins of sticky toffee pudding are unknown and disputed. Francis Coulson and Robert Lee developed and served the dish at their Sharrow Bay Country House Hotel in the Lake District, in North West England, in the 1970s.\\"Puddings: how they have changed through history\\". The Telegraph. Retrieved 21 February 2018 Food critic Simon Hopkinson claimed that Coulson told him he got the recipe from a Patricia Martin of Claughton in Lancashire. Martin had published the recipe in a compilation that later became The Good Food Guide Dinner Party Book, and first served the dish at her country hotel. Coulson's recipe only differs from Martin's in the sauce. Her son later told Hopkinson that she had originally got the recipe from two Canadian air force officers who had lodged at her hotel during the Second World War. According to Hopkinson, this Canadian origin makes sense, as the pudding uses a batter more akin to that of an American muffin, rather than an English sponge.

He wrote many well-known hymns, including \\"Almost Persuaded\\" (1871); \\"Hallelujah, What a Saviour!\\" (1875); \\"Let the Lower Lights Be Burning\\"; \\"Wonderful Words of Life\\" (1875); and the tune for Horatio Spafford's \\"It Is Well with My Soul\\" (1876). Bliss's house in Rome, Pennsylvania is now operated as the Philip P. Bliss Gospel Songwriters Museum. Early life P. P. Bliss was born in (what is now Hollywood) Clearfield County, Pennsylvania in a log cabin. His father was Mr. Isaac Bliss, who taught the family to pray daily. And his mother was Lydia Doolittle. He loved music and was allowed to develop his passion for singing. His sister was Mary Elizabeth Willson, a gospel singer, singer, composer and evangelist.Appletons' Cyclopedia of American Biography pages 293 & 294https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81618503/philip-paul- blisshttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bliss-5074 When he was a boy, Bliss's family moved to Kinsman, Ohio in 1844, and then returned to Pennsylvania in 1847, settling first in Espeyville, Crawford County, and a year later in Tioga County. Bliss had little formal education and was taught by his mother, from the Bible. At age 10, while selling vegetables to help support the family, Bliss first heard a piano. At age 11, he left home to make his own living. He worked in timber camps and sawmills. While working, he irregularly went to school to further his education. Teaching At 17, Bliss finished his requirements to teach. The next year, in 1856, he became a schoolmaster at Hartsville, New York, and during the summer he worked on a farm. In 1857, Bliss met J. G. Towner, who taught singing. Towner recognized Bliss's talent and gave him his first formal voice training. He also met William B. Bradbury, who persuaded him to become a music teacher. His first musical composition was sold for a flute. In 1858, he took up an appointment in Rome Academy, Pennsylvania. In 1858, in Rome, Bliss met Lucy J. Young, whom he married on June 1, 1859. She came from a musical family and encouraged the development of his talent. She was a Presbyterian, and Bliss joined her Church. At age 22, Bliss became an itinerant music teacher. On horseback, he went from community to community accompanied by a melodeon. In July of 1860, the Normal Academy of Music was held in Geneseo, New York was being held for the music community. Musicians of renown were administrating the six-week event. Bliss was so excited about it, but when he realized that he could in no way afford the expense of the school, he was heartbroken. He knew it would be a great experience for him, but he had no money! When (Bliss' wife's) Grandma Allen noticed his sad demeanor she was full of sympathy. She asked him what it costs, he replied that it would \\"cost as much as thirty dollars\\". After telling him that thirty dollars \\"was a good deal of money\\", she told him of her old stocking that she has been \\"dropping pieces of silver for a good many years\\". She had Bliss count the amount of money in the stocking, they realized it had more than the amount needed. \\"And Bliss spent six weeks of the heartiest study of his life at the Normal\\".\\"Memoir of PP Bliss\\"; by D.W. Whittle 1877; Pages 23 &24https://www.wikitree.com/photo/jpg/Bliss-5074-5https://www.wikitree.com/photo/jpg/Bliss-5074-6 Bliss was now recognized as an expert within his local area. He continued the itinerant teaching. At this time he turned to composition. None of his songs were ever copyrighted. Evangelist In 1864, the Blisses moved to Chicago. Bliss was then 26. He became known as a singer and teacher. He wrote a number of Gospel songs. Bliss was paid $100 for a concert tour which lasted only a fortnight. He was amazed so much money could be earned so quickly. The following week, he was drafted for service in the Union Army. Because the war was almost over, his notice was canceled after a few weeks. The unit he served with was the 149th Pennsylvania Infantry. Following this, Bliss went on another concert tour, but this failed. He was, however, offered a position at Root and Cady Musical Publishers, at a salary of $150 per month. Bliss worked with this company from 1865 until 1873. He conducted musical conventions, singing schools and concerts for his employers. He continued to compose hymns, which were often printed in his employer's books. In 1869, Bliss formed an association with Dwight L. Moody. Moody and others urged him to give up his job and become a missionary singer. In 1874, Bliss decided he was called to full-time Christian evangelism. Bliss made significant amounts of money from royalties and gave them to charity and to support his evangelical endeavours. Bliss wrote the gospel song \\"Hold the Fort\\" after hearing Major Daniel Webster Whittle narrate an experience in the American Civil War. Death On 29 December 1876, the Pacific Express train on which Bliss and his wife were traveling in approached Ashtabula, Ohio. While the train was in the process of crossing a trestle bridge it collapsed, and the carriages fell into the ravine below. Bliss escaped from the wreck, but the carriages caught fire and Bliss returned to try to extricate his wife. No trace of either body was discovered. Ninety-two of the 159 passengers are believed to have died in what became known as the Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster. The Blisses were survived by their two sons, George and Philip Paul, then aged four and one, respectively. A monument to Bliss was erected in Rome, Pennsylvania. 'Bliss Monument Information' Found in his trunk, which somehow survived the crash and fire, was a manuscript bearing the lyrics of the only well-known Bliss Gospel song for which he did not write a tune: \\"I Will Sing of My Redeemer.\\" Soon thereafter, set to a tune specially written for it by James McGranahan, it became one of the first songs recorded by Thomas Alva Edison.McCann, Forrest M. (1997). Hymns and History: An Annotated Survey of Sources. Abilene, TX: ACU Press . Pp. 154, 359-360. Works According to the Philip P. Bliss Gospel Songwriters Museum, the books of songs by Bliss are as follows: The Charm (1871); The Song Tree, a collection of parlor and concert music (1872); The Sunshine for Sunday Schools (1873); The Joy for conventions and for church choir music (1873); and Gospel Songs for Gospel meetings and Sunday schools (1874). All of these books were copyrighted by John Church and Co. In addition to these publications, in 1875, Bliss compiled, and in connection with Ira D. Sankey, edited Gospel Hymns and Sacred Songs. In 1876, his last work was the preparation of the book known as Gospel Hymns No. 2, Sankey being associated with him as editor. These last two books are published by John Church and Co. and Biglow and Main jointly - the work of Mr. Bliss in them, under the copyright of John Church and Co. Many of his pieces appear in the books of George F. Root and Horatio R. Palmer, and many were published in sheet music form. A large number of his popular pieces were published in The Prize, a book of Sunday school songs edited by Root in 1870. Three of his hyms appear in the 1985 hymnbook of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy (#335) (popularly known as Let the Lower Lights Be Burning); More Holiness Give Me (#131); and Should You Feel Inclined to Censure (#235) (words by an anonymous writer put to the tune of Brighthly Beams}. Connection to Titanic Survivors of the RMS Titanic disaster, including Dr. Washington Dodge, reported that passengers in lifeboats sang the Bliss hymn \\"Pull For The Shore\\", some while rowing. During a 11 May 1912 luncheon talk at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, just a few weeks after his family and he survived the sinking of the ocean liner, Dodge recounted: \\"Watching the vessel closely, it was seen from time to time that this submergence forward was increasing.

She served on the San Jose, California, City Council from 2005 to 2014, representing District 7, and she additionally served as Vice Mayor from 2011 to 2014. She was the first Vietnamese American elected to the city council. Currently, Madison is the Executive Vice President(EVP) of The Silicon Valley Organization, also known as the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce. As EVP, she is responsible for driving the organization‚Äôs public policy, advocacy, political action, economic and community development strategies and implementation. Early life Madison and her family escaped Vietnam on a small fishing boat when she was four years old. Her family then settled in various refugee camps in the Philippines until a Lutheran church sponsored them to Scottsdale, Arizona. Her father worked as a janitor, receiving a stipend of only $500 a month to support his wife and children. Eventually, he moved his family to Modesto, California, in search of employment for his family in the Central Valley. Madison worked in the fields alongside her parents as a teenager. She is one of nine siblings. Madison received her Bachelor of Arts in History from the University of California, Santa Cruz. She received a master's degree from the University of Chicago. She returned to California in 2000 to pursue a Ph.D. in sociology at UC Santa Cruz. Political career =School board= Nguyen began to become more involved in politics in 2001, while working as a sociology instructor at De Anza College; inspired by MTV's \\"Rock the Vote\\" campaign, she and members of the Vietnamese community organized a voter drive in which nearly 5,000 new voters registered to vote for the first time. She followed that up with a run for a position on the Franklin-McKinley School District Board of Education, hoping that her election would encourage Vietnamese Americans to get more involved in local politics. Her win made her one of the first two school board officials of Vietnamese descent in the United States. The other, elected around the same time, was Lan Nguyen of Garden Grove, a city in southern California's Orange County. However, it was Nguyen's organization of protests in support of Bich Cau Thi Tran, a Vietnamese woman shot to death by a San Jose police officer that brought her to the forefront of people's minds in the Vietnamese American community. Nguyen, who felt the incident was being ignored by the public and the media, organized a rally to which nearly 300 people showed up. =City Council= In September 2005, she ran for city council in a special election to replace Terry Gregory in District 7. Vietnamese Americans, who formed less than 10% of San Jose's population at the time, turned out in record numbers during the primary election in June to support Madison Nguyen and Linda Nguyen, pushing them ahead of seven other candidates. Madison Nguyen won 44% of the primary vote, while Linda Nguyen, a real estate attorney, received 27%. In the run- off, Madison Nguyen received 62% of the votes cast, beating out Linda Nguyen to become the first Vietnamese American to serve on the San Jose's City Council.e District naming controversy and recall attempt Nguyen's support from the Vietnamese American community suffered a sharp reversal in early January 2008, in a controversy over whether an area of a Story Road in her council district with a large percentage of Vietnamese retailers should be named as \\"Little Saigon\\" or \\"Saigon Business District\\". Little Saigon is a common name used for various other Vietnamese-American commercial enclaves, particularly known in Orange County, California. Nguyen suggested the name \\"Saigon Business District\\" after she heard from different groups in her council district who wanted the word \\"New\\" to be included in the name, indicating a new life in America after they left their homeland. She thought Saigon Business District was a good compromise between Little Saigon and New Saigon so she recommended Saigon Business District as the name for the designation. Supporters of the Little Saigon denounced Nguyen as a traitor to the community because she did not support what they deemed as the \\"majority\\" of the Vietnamese community supported, which was \\"Little Saigon.\\" The City Council voted to name the business district as Saigon Business District. After recurring protests in front of City Hall for several months, on March 4, 2008, the city council voted to rescind the \\"Saigon Business District\\" name, but stopped short of renaming it \\"Little Saigon\\". Instead, they proposed setting up a process by which business owners could choose district names. However, anger against Nguyen remained. On April 22, 2008, the issue was reopened with the submission of recall papers against Nguyen by the Recall Madison Nguyen committee. On October 9, the petition qualified for the March 3, 2009 ballot, having garnered more than 150% of the needed valid signatures. On March 3, 2009, voters rejected the recall attempt with a 55-45% vote. A year later, Nguyen won re-election and in 2011, she was nominated by Mayor Chuck Reed and was approved unanimously by the city council to be Vice Mayor. She is also the first Vietnamese Vice Mayor in the history of San Jose. =2016 State Assembly campaign= In April 2015, Madison Nguyen announced her intention to run for California State Assembly District 27, an open seat being vacated by term- limited Nora Campos.[circular reference] The Primary election was in June 2016, followed by a November general election, which coincided with the next presidential contest. Nguyen began rolling out her campaign platform soon after her announcement. Her first significant proposal was to support a new University of California campus, and to locate it in San Jose. Her first notable endorsement came from San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. Other declared candidates included San Jose City Councilmember Ash Kalra, Santa Clara County Board of Education Trustee Darcie Green, activist Cong Do, and Republican Van Le. Madison won a decisive victory in the primary, with more than 11,000 more votes than her closest competitor. 2016 California State Assembly candidacy  References External links *Campaign homepage *Official page on the San Jose city government website *What's Happening in San Jose Vietnamese Community from the Vietnamese American Council; contains several news stories on Madison Nguyen *This American Life - Episode 381: Turncoat Prologue and Act One is about Madison Nguyen and the district naming controversy Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:American women of Vietnamese descent in politics Category:California Democrats Category:People from Modesto, California Category:San Jose City Council members Category:University of California, Santa Cruz alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Vietnamese emigrants to the United States Category:Women in California politics Category:Women city councillors in the United States ","title":"Madison Nguyen"},{"id":"3008832","text":"Heribert of Cologne ( 970 - 16 March 1021), also known as Saint Heribert, was a German Roman Catholic prelate who served as the Archbishop of Cologne from 999 until his death. He also served as the Chancellor for the Emperor Otto III since 994. He also collaborated with Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor with whom relations were strained though were strengthened over time. Heribert's canonization was confirmed around 1075. Life Tomb. Heribert was born around 970 in Worms to Count Hugo and Tietwista. On the maternal side his half-brother was Heinrich who was the Bishop of W√ºrzburg and his brother was Earl Getseman Vingngau. He was educated in the school at the Worms Cathedral and at the Benedictine Gorze convent in Lorraine. Heribert studied alongside Bruno de Carinthia who was the future Pope Gregory V. He wanted to become a Benedictine monk but his father disapproved of that path and Heribert no longer pursued it. He returned to the Worms Cathedral to serve as its provost and received his ordination to the priesthood in 994 from Bishop Holdebold. The Bishop of Worms wanted Heribert to be his successor though the emperor took notice of him and planned to bring him as an advisor to his court. The Emperor Otto III appointed him in 994 as the Italian chancellor and in 998 for the German kingdom. He held the latter position until Otto III's death. He had accompanied the emperor to Rome in 996 and again in 997 and was still on the peninsula when word came that he had been chosen as the Archbishop of Cologne. In Benevento he received investiture and the pallium from the new Pope Sylvester II on 9 July 999 and on the following Christmas received his episcopal consecration at Cologne in the archdiocesan cathedral. In 1002 he was present at the deathbed of Otto III at Paterno. While returning to his homeland to Aachen with the Emperor's remains and the imperial insignia he was captured at the behest of the future Saint Heinrich II whom he had first opposed but later served. Once the latter was made king in 1002 he acknowledged him as such and served as his collaborator and still as chancellor. The pair's relations were not the best though the new emperor came to respect his abilities and the rift between them turned into a friendship. In 1003 he founded the Deutz convent on the Rhine. Heribert often sent alms to the poor and sent alms to priests to distribute to the poor. Heribert died on 16 March 1021 in his archdiocese and was buried at his convent church after their transferal on 30 August 1147. Heribert contracted a fever while on a pastoral visitation and hurried back to Cologne to recover where he died within the week. Canonization Heribert was honoured as a saint during his lifetime and was canonized in about 1075. His reported miracles included ending a drought; he is thus invoked for beneficial rains.

NCVIA's purpose was to eliminate the potential financial liability of vaccine manufacturers due to vaccine injury claims in order to ensure a stable market supply of vaccines, and to provide cost-effective arbitration for vaccine injury claims. Under the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters. Background In the 1970s and 1980s, a controversy erupted related to the question of whether the whole-cell pertussis component caused permanent brain injury known as pertussis vaccine encephalopathy, in rare cases. No studies showed a causal connection, and later studies showed no connection of any type between the DPT vaccine and permanent brain injury. The alleged vaccine-induced brain damage proved to be an unrelated condition, infantile epilepsy. In 1990, the Journal of the American Medical Association called the connection a \\"myth\\" and \\"nonsense\\". However, before that point, criticism of the studies showing no connection and a few well-publicized anecdotal reports of permanent disability that were blamed on the DPT vaccine gave rise to 1970s anti-DPT movements. In the United States, low profit margins and an increase in vaccine-related lawsuits led many manufacturers to stop producing the DPT vaccine by the early 1980s. By 1985, vaccine manufacturers had difficulty obtaining liability insurance. The price of DPT vaccine skyrocketed, leading providers to curtail purchases, limiting availability. Only one company was still manufacturing pertussis vaccine in the US by the end of 1985. Because of this, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) in 1986, establishing a federal no-fault system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines. NCVIA provisions =Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System= The NCVIA also mandates that all health care providers must report certain adverse events following vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The NCVIA also established a committee from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to review the existing literature on vaccine adverse events occurring after immunization, regardless of whether there was a direct link between events. =National Vaccine Program Office= As a result of the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) was established within the DHHS. The NVPO is responsible for coordinating immunization-related activities between all DHHS agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). =Vaccine Information Statements= The NCVIA requires that all health care providers who administer vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and varicella must provide a Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) to the vaccine recipient, their parent or legal guardian prior to each dose. A VIS must be given with every vaccination, including each dose in a multi-dose series. Each VIS contains a brief description of the disease, as well as the risks and benefits of the vaccine. Each VIS is developed by the CDC and distributed to state and local health departments as well as individual providers.

These Emperors are Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Lucius Verus, Marcus Aurelius, and Commodus. The first five of them (excluding Lucius Verus) are commonly known as the \\"Five Good Emperors\\". The first five of the six successions within this dynasty were notable in that the reigning Emperor adopted the candidate of his choice to be his successor. Under Roman law, an adoption established a bond legally as strong as that of kinship. Because of this, all but the first and last of the Nerva‚ÄìAntonine emperors are called Adoptive Emperors. The importance of official adoption in Roman society has often been consideredE.g. by Machiavelli and Gibbon as a conscious repudiation of the principle of dynastic inheritance and has been deemed one of the factors of the period's prosperity. However, this was not a new practice. It was common for patrician families to adopt, and Roman emperors had adopted heirs in the past: the Emperor Augustus had adopted Tiberius and the Emperor Claudius had adopted Nero. Julius Caesar, dictator perpetuo and considered to be instrumental in the transition from Republic to Empire, adopted Gaius Octavius, who would become Augustus, Rome's first emperor. Moreover, there was a family connection as Trajan adopted his first cousin once removed and great-nephew by marriage Hadrian, and Hadrian made his half-nephew by marriage and heir Antoninus Pius adopt both Hadrian's second cousin three times removed and half-great-nephew by marriage Marcus Aurelius, also Antoninus' nephew by marriage, and the son of his original planned successor, Lucius Verus. The naming of his son Commodus as heir by Marcus Aurelius was considered to be an unfortunate choice and the beginning of the Empire's decline. With Commodus' murder in 192, the Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty came to an end; it was followed by a period of turbulence known as the Year of the Five Emperors. History = Nerva‚ÄìTrajan dynasty = Nerva was the first of the dynasty. Though his reign was short, it saw a partial reconciliation between the army, Senate and commoners. Nerva adopted as his son the popular military leader Trajan. In turn, Hadrian succeeded Trajan; he had been the latter's heir presumptive and averred that he had been adopted by him on Trajan's deathbed. File:Nerva Tivoli Massimo.jpgNerva File:Traianus Glyptothek Munich 72.jpgTrajan File:Bust Hadrian Musei Capitolini MC817.jpgHadrian = Antonine dynasty = The Antonines are four Roman Emperors who ruled between 138 and 192: Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus and Commodus. In 138, after a long reign dedicated to the cultural unification and consolidation of the empire, the Emperor Hadrian named Antoninus Pius his son and heir, under the condition that he adopt both Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Hadrian died that same year, and Antoninus began a peaceful, benevolent reign. He adhered strictly to Roman traditions and institutions and shared his power with the Roman Senate. Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus succeeded Antoninus Pius in 161 upon that emperor's death, and co-ruled until Verus' death in 169. Marcus continued the Antonine legacy after Verus' death as an unpretentious and gifted administrator and leader. He died in 180 and was followed by his biological son, Commodus.

(2007). A History of World Societies (7th ed.). Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, v‚Äìvi. . The term was coined by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli in his posthumously published 1531 book The Discourses on Livy: Machiavelli argued that these adopted emperors earned the respect of those around them through good governing: Edward Gibbon wrote in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire that their rule was a time when \\"the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of wisdom and virtue\\".Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, I.78. Gibbon believed that these benevolent monarchs and their moderate policies were unusual and contrasted with their more tyrannical and oppressive successors. = Alternative hypothesis = One hypothesis posits that adoptive succession is thought to have arisen because of a lack of biological heirs. All but the last of the adoptive emperors had no legitimate biological sons to succeed them. They were therefore obliged to pick a successor somewhere else; as soon as the Emperor could look towards a biological son to succeed him, adoptive succession was set aside. The dynasty may be broken up into the Nerva‚ÄìTrajan dynasty (also called the Ulpian dynasty after Trajan's nomen gentile 'Ulpius') and Antonine dynasty (after their common name Antoninus).

Lay ecclesial ministers are coworkers with the bishop alongside priests and deacons. In other contexts, these may be known as \\"lay pastoral workers\\", \\"pastoral assistants\\", etc. Overview Prior to and since the Second Vatican Council, several ministries that had for a time been retained by the presbyterate (priests) were returned to the laity, and several new forms of ministry emerged. The burgeoning awareness of the vocation of the laity as apostles to the secular world and stewards of the Church's mission as an evangelizer has given rise to the popular term \\"lay ministry\\" to refer to the active vocation of all the baptized. This general ministry of the laity has at times also been called the \\"lay apostolate\\"For example, by Pope Paul VI in the decree, Apostolicam Actuositatem and the \\"lay vocation\\".For example, by Pope John Paul II in the apostolic exhortation Christifideles Laici Included in this general lay ministry are several specific ministries designed to support the Church community, such as lector/reader, extraordinary minister of Holy Communion, catechist, sponsor/godparent, spouse, parent, etc. In addition to this general lay ministry, there are a number of non-ordained people who have undertaken roles, that immediately prior to Vatican II belonged entirely to the ordained, including parish pastoral and catechetical staff, hospital and prison chaplains, campus ministers, and many other diocesan leadership roles. Today, even the Roman Curia includes a small number of lay ecclesial ministers. Lay ecclesial ministry includes a broad category rather than a specific job title. It has been adopted by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) to \\"establish a framework to indicate what is common to many roles and responsibilities undertaken by lay persons, for example, Pastoral Coordinator or Moderator of a Parish, Pastoral Associate, Director of Religious Education, Youth Minister, Campus Minister, Hospital Chaplain.\\". According to the USCCB, this ecclesial ministry includes: * Authorization of the hierarchy to serve publicly in the local Church * Leadership in a particular area of ministry * Close mutual collaboration with the pastoral ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons * Preparation and formation appropriate to the level of responsibilities that are assigned to them including; human, spiritual, pastoral, and theological dimensionsSee USCCB Subcommittee on Lay Ministry, Co-Workers in the Vineyard of the Lord: A Resrce for Guiding the Development of Lay Ecclesial Ministry (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2005), 10; Lay Ecclesial Ministry: The State of the Questions (Washington, DC: USCCB, 1999), 7‚Äì8; USCCB, Called and Gifted for the Third Millennium(Washington, DC: USCCB, 1995), 16‚Äì17; and USCCB, Called and Gifted: The American Catholic Laity (Washington, DC: USCCB, 1980), 3‚Äì4. While many bishops are quick to note that this does not represent a new level of the hierarchy, the Church has observed a clear differentiation between Lay Ecclesial Ministry and the general ministry of the laity. Clearly members of the laity, lay ecclesial ministers, serve as ecclesial ministers in the same vocation as bishops, priests, deacons, and theologians.An Ecclesial Ministry is one which is directed ad intra rather than ad extra. The ecclesial vocations serve the Church, while lay vocations are the Church serving the world. Programs for the theological education and pastoral formation of laypersons, for the purpose in engaging in full-time and often lifelong ministry in the Church, have grown exponentially in the last four decades. By 2002 there were 34,000 lay ministers who had graduated from United States Lay Ecclesial Ministry Programs. As of 2008, there are more than ten times as many students preparing in university and diocesan divinity programs for a vocation as a Lay Ecclesial Minister, as there are seminarians preparing for the presbyterate. Since 1986, there has even been a Roman college for future lay ecclesial ministers and theologians studying at Pontifical Universities, the Lay Centre at Foyer Unitas. In many dioceses, lay ecclesial ministers already account for the majority of the ecclesial and pastoral ministers alongside deacons and presbyters. According to a study by the National Pastoral Life Center, since at least 2007 the number of Lay Ecclesial Ministers employed in full- or part-time parish ministry (29,000) has exceeded the number of presbyters employed in full- or part-time parish ministry (27,000), and the number of Lay Ecclesial Ministers continues to grow while the number of priests in parish ministry continues to contract. The number of Lay Ecclesial Ministers in parish grew in 2009 to 37,929.p 38. \\"The Changing Face of U.S. Catholic Parishes\\" CARA and the Emerging Model Project July 2011 Many more Lay Ecclesial Ministers serve in other Catholic institutions, schools, hospitals, dioceses, etc. The reality of lay ecclesial ministry is experienced in a number of regions. In Germany and the Netherlands, the terms \\"pastoral worker\\" or \\"pastoral assistant\\" are preferred for those engaged in lay ecclesial ministry. In parts of South America, and islands of the South Pacific, lay ecclesial ministers who are religious educators are called \\"catechists\\". In the United States, the term catechist more generally refers to volunteer lay Sunday school teachers, but in a broader meaning also includes Catholic school teachers, as well as clergy and lay ecclesial ministers responsible for overseeing faith formation.

This event has also been called The El-Aaiun Intifada by the same sources. Background Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara, was annexed by Morocco in 1975, as Spain pulled out. A war with the Polisario Front, which according to the UN represent the indigenous Sahrawi population, and was backed by neighboring Algeria, ensued. In 1991 a cease-fire was agreed upon, on the condition of a referendum on self-determination (including the options of independence or integration into Morocco). Since 1991 the terms of a referendum have been subject to years of dispute between the parties, although the cease-fire continues to hold despite remaining tensions. Morocco controls the majority of the territory, with Polisario forces controlling a rump. A UN mission MINURSO mission patrols the demarcation line. Sahrawi political activity in the Moroccan-controlled parts of Western Sahara remains severely restricted, and police crackdowns and forced disappearances were a frequent response to civil protest. The political climate gradually relaxed in the 1990s, after the cease-fire, and following considerable liberalization in Morocco proper. Since political liberalisation, intermittent protests have broken out and pro-Polisario groups have declaring minor \\"intifadas\\" in 1999 and 2000, often resulting in dozens of demonstrators being arrested. Demonstrations and arrests Demonstrations began on 21 May 2005 in El Aai√∫n, after relatives protesting the transfer of a Sahrawi prisoner accused of drug dealing and insulting the Moroccan monarchy to a prison in Agadir were violently dispersed by police, provoking further demonstrations over the next several days. Protests spread by the end of May to other towns in the Western Sahara, such as Smara and Dakhla, and were accompanied by demonstrations by Sahrawi students living in Moroccan cities such as Agadir, Casablanca, Fes, Marrakech and Rabat. Moroccan public security units quelled the disturbances, although some subsequent pro-independence demonstrations have subsequently flared up, most recently reported in November 2005. On 30 October 2005, a first fatality was recorded when 31-year-old Hamdi Lembarki died after what human rights organizations assured was police brutality during his arrest, although at first Moroccan authorities attributed his death to an accident.2005 County Reports on Human Rights Practices ‚Äì Morocco ‚Äì Respect of Human rights US Department of State Over a hundred pro- Polisario Sahrawi protesters were reported arrested by Moroccan authorities by international human rights, and approximately thirty demonstrators and well- known Sahrawi human rights-activists have been imprisoned after summary trials. Among them are the former political prisoner Ali Salem Tamek (who did not partake directly in any demonstrations, but was arrested when returning from abroad), human rights-activist Mohamed Elmoutaoikil, and Aminatou Haidar, a former disappeared. An international campaign for her release was signed by 178 members of the European Parliament, and she was nominated as a candidate for the Sakharov Prize. A 50-day hunger strike of all the arrested Sahrawis put the health of several at risk, and the action was aborted. On 14 December 2005, 14 pro-independence Sahrawis and human-rights activists, including the activists mentioned above and most of the remaining pro-Polisario Sahrawi political leadership, were sentenced to between six months and three years in prison by an El-Aai√∫n court, on charges of disturbing public order, membership of illegal associations, incitement to unrest, damaging public property and rioting. They denied the charges of using violence. Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had expressed serious concern over the trials, pointing to reports of torture and previous abuse of some of the prisoners. International reactions Several international human rights-organizations have shown interest in alleged Moroccan abuse of Sahrawi demonstrators. Amnesty International has demanded an investigation into reports of torture of prisoners and called for fair trials, and the release of political prisoners. This has been echoed by Human Rights Watch and others. Morocco has limited journalists' and diplomats' access to the territory, claiming that their public presence is used by pro-Polisario activists to trigger more riots. Investigative missions from European countries have been denied access to the territory, including several high-ranking parliamentary delegations and foreign ambassadors to Morocco. Several foreign journalists, mainly European, but also al Jazeera correspondents, were expelled after interviewing protesters, and others have been prevented from visiting it. In November 2005, Moroccan authorities shut down a number of pro-independence or pro-Polisario Internet sites. This was condemned by Reporters Without Borders as an example of internet censorship.

Its first issue was published in April 1983. Indy Week is a member of the Association of Alternative Newsmedia and has a progressive, liberal political perspective. The Columbia Journalism Review has cited the newspaper for its \\"spine of steel.\\" The print edition is published on Wednesdays. History The paper was founded in 1983 by Steve Schewel and was originally published as the North Carolina Independent and was bi-weekly. Its publisher was Carolina Independent Publications, Inc. It was renamed the Independent effective March 1985. In April 1988 the Independent published endorsements of state political candidates for the upcoming Democratic Party's primary election. The paper admonished its readers not to vote for State Senator Harold Hardison and in response a member of Hardison's campaign organization collected approximately 7,000 copies of the paper from newsstands in downtown Raleigh and dumped them in the trash. The Independent identified the person responsible and reported the story in its next edition. The story was reported by media across North Carolina, raising the newspaper's public profile. In 1989, publication was changed to weekly, and the name altered to the Independent Weekly. In September 2002, Carolina Independent Publications acquired the area's other major weekly, the Spectator, from Creative Loafing Inc. Founded in 1978 by Godfrey Cheshire III and others in Raleigh, the Spectator had been owned by Creative Loafing since 1997 and was well known for its coverage of the arts; the name lived on as the name of the Independent's calendar of events. In 2010, the Independent presented the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival in downtown Raleigh. The three-day annual event happens in September and features local, national and international bands in just about every genre. On September 27, 2012, the Independent Weekly was purchased by ZM INDY, Inc., whose owners, Mark Zusman and Richard Meeker, also own Willamette Week. Why Willamette Week bought Independent Weekly The name of the newspaper and website was changed to Indy Week. On Thursday, June 11, 2020 Jeffrey Billman was fired from his position as Editor. The stated reason was that he had failed to follow up on a sexual misconduct tip regarding a local restaurant that had been brought to his attention in May of 2019. Possibly prompting the dismissal, the edit and design staff released a letter stating their unwillingness to work for Billman going forward.  Awards  The paper's reporters have won several major awards, including the George Polk Award, the Investigative Reporters and Editors Award (finalist), the Green Eyeshade Award for the South's best journalism (second place, 2004 and 2005), the Baltimore Suns H.L. Mencken Writing Award, and the Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism.

Background The claims of Italy over Libya dated back to verbal discussions after the Congress of Berlin (1878), in which France and Great Britain had agreed for the occupation of Tunisia and Cyprus respectively, both part of the then ailing Ottoman Empire. When Italian diplomats hinted about a possible opposition of their government, the French replied that Tripoli would have been a counterpart for Italy. In 1902 Italy and France had signed a secret treaty which accorded freedom of intervention in Tripolitania and Morocco. However, the Italian government did little to put in practice the opportunity, and knowledge of the Libyan territory and resources remained scarce in the following years. The Italian press began a massive lobbying campaign in favour of an invasion of Libya, at the end of March 1911. It was fancifully depicted as rich of minerals, full of water, and defended by only 4,000 Ottoman troops. Also the population was considered hostile to the Ottoman Empire and friendly to the Italians. The future invasion was described as little more than a \\"military walk\\". The Italian government showed initially hesitant, but in the summer the preparations for the invasion were finally carried out, and Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti began to probe the other European major powers about their reactions of a possible invasion of Libya. The Socialist party had strong influence over the public opinion. However, it was in opposition and also divided on the issue. It acted ineffectively against the military intervention. An ultimatum was presented to the Ottoman government of CUP, in the night of 26 ‚Äì September 27. The CUP, through the Austrian intermediation, replied with the proposal of handing over control over Libya without warring, maintaining a merely formal Ottoman suzerainty. This suggestion was comparable to the situation in Egypt, which was under formal Ottoman suzerainty, but was actually controlled by the United Kingdom. Giolitti refused, and war was declared on September 29, 1911. Military actions In spite of the time it had had to prepare the invasion, the Italian Army was partially prepared when the war broke out, mainly because of some opposition to the war in Italy (including from Benito Mussolini, then a socialist). Between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis from Mogadishu, the then capital of Italian Somaliland, served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers in the Italo-Turkish War. Most of the troops stationed never returned home until they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. The Italian fleet had appeared off Tripoli in the evening of September 28, but started to bomb the port only on October 3. The city was conquered by 1,500 sailors, much to the enthusiasm of the interventionist minority in Italy. Another last proposal of a friendly settlement was rejected by the Italians, and the Turks determined therefore to defend the province until the last bullet but with a guerrilla war. Italian landings in Libya The first disembarkment of troops happened on October 10, under the command of general Carlo Caneva, and soon Tripoli, Benghazi, Derna and Tobruk were occupied. The Italian contingent of 20,000 troops was deemed sufficient to the accomplishment of the conquest at the time. Tobruk, Derna and Al-Khums were easily conquered, but the same was not the case for Benghazi. The city of Tripoli and surroundings -after a destructive bombing of the Turkish fortifications- were quickly conquered by 1,500 Italian sailors, welcomed by the population who started to collaborate with the Italian authoritiesTripoli inhabitants welcomed the Italians, p. 36-40 (in Italian) The first partial setback for the Italian troops happened on October 23 in the Sciara Sciat massacre, when the bad placement of the Italian troops near Tripoli led to their almost complete encirclement by more mobile Libyan cavalry, backed by some Turk regular unit and by local civilians. However, the Italians were able to defeat the Turk and Libyan forces in a few hours. The attack was portrayed as a simple \\"revolt\\" by the Italian press, but almost resulted in the annihilation of much of the Italian expeditionary corps. Which, consequently, was increasingly enlarged, until it amounted to 100,000 men, who had to face 20,000 Arab and 8,000 Turks, all badly armed. The war turned into a position one, and even the first use of aviation in a modern war scored little result. Italian soldiers watching corpses of dead Libyan and Turk defenders On November 2 there was a tentative counterattack by the Ottoman forces in the small battle at Tobruk, but even here the city remained under Italian occupation. Meanwhile, 1,500 Libyan volunteers attacked Italian troops who were building trenches near recently occupied Derna. The Italians, who were outnumbered, but had superior weaponry, held the line. A lack of coordination between the Italian units sent from Derna as reinforcements and the intervention of Turkish artillery threatened the Italian line, and the Arabs attempted to surround the Italian troops. Further Italian reinforcements, however, were able to stabilize the situation, and the battle ended in the afternoon with an Italian victory. Then the Italian command sent three columns of infantry to disband the Arab Turkish camp near Derna. The Italian troops occupied a plateau, interrupting Turkish supply lines. Three days later, the Turkish commander, Enver Bey, attacked the Italian positions on the plateau. The larger Italian fire drove back the Turkish soldiers, who were surrounded by a battalion of Alpini and suffered heavy losses. A later Turkish attack had the same outcome. Although many elements of the local Arab population collaborated with the Italians, counterattacks by Turkish soldiers with the help of some local troops (who declared a Moslem jihad against the Christian invaders) confined the Italian army to the coastal region from the beginning of the Italian invasion. The foreign military attaches watching the conflict were amazed to note that general Caneva did not use cavalry in a war zone admirably well-suited to it and how he did not consider requesting as soon as possible reinforcements for his already-small force.Sergio Romano. \\"La Quarta sponda. La guerra di Libia, 1911/1912\\", pag. 270 On October 15, 1911 nine Italian \\"Specialist Battalion\\" aeroplanes and 11 pilots landed in Libya. On October 24th, the Italian pilot Captain Riccardo Moizo carried out a reconnaissance flight in Tripolitania, reportedly the first ever strategic reconnaissance by aeroplane.Wright, J. 2008. The Emergence of Libya. London: Silphium Press, 230 On November 1st, another Italian pilot, Gavotti, dropped four 1.5 kg bombs on Ain Zara, pulling the pins with his teeth. This was the first aerial bombing in history. Libya 1911: How an Italian pilot began the air war era, by Alan Johnston With a decree of November 5, 1911 Italy declared its suzerainty over all Ottoman Libya, although it fully controlled only some coastal stretches. Moves towards a peace Italy meanwhile maintained a total naval supremacy, and could extend its control to almost all of the 2,000 km of the Libyan coast between January and the early August 1912. To unblock the situation, Italy began operations against the Turkish possessions in the Aegean Sea, after having received approval from the other powers, which were eager to end a war that was lasting much longer than what had been foreseen. Italy occupied twelve island in that sea, the so-called Dodecanesus, but this raised the ire of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who feared that this could fuel the irredentism of nations such as Serbia and Greece, causing unbalance in the already fragile situation in the Balkan area. The only other relevant military operation of the summer 1912 was an attack of five Italian torpedo boats in the Dardanelles, on July 18. In the September, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece prepared their armies for the war against the Ottoman Empire, taking advantage of its difficulties in the war against Italy. On October 8, Montenegro declared war on the Turks, starting the Balkan Wars. The Italian diplomacy decided to exploit the situation to obtain a favourable peace. The treaty was signed at Lausanne at 16.45 of October 18, 1912. The terms were formally equal to those requested by Istanbul at the beginning of the war, and maintained a formal Ottoman suzerainty over Libya, which received only an autonomous status under the judiciary rule of a \\"Cadis\\" elected by the Sultan. Aftermath The invasion of Libya was a costly enterprise for Italy. Instead of the 30 million liras a month judged sufficient at its beginning, it reached a cost of 80 million a month, and for a far longer period than the original estimate. This caused economic imbalance at home. From the political point, the creation of Italian Libya showed (to observers like Benito Mussolini) that the lobbying power of an active and powerful minority could have a great power in the country, as the advent of fascism would show after World War I. As for Libya itself, the Italian control over much of its territory remained very ineffective until the late 1920s, when forces under general Badoglio and Graziani waged punitive pacification campaigns which turned into terrible acts of repression. Resistance petered out only after the execution of rebel leader Omar Mukhtar on September 15, 1931. Successively Libya was fully controlled by the Italians and integrated into Italian Libya and into Italy's Fourth Shore until World War II.

Almost every minute of every day, a child dies because of AIDS, and another two young people are infected with HIV. In 2007, 270,000 children under the age of 15 died because of AIDS. Millions more have lost their parents to the disease.http://www.uniteforchildren.org/files/EIDWorkingPaperJune02.pdf HIV is increasingly a disease of the young, particularly girls. Despite the already catastrophic impacts of HIV and AIDS, worse may yet be to come. Even so, HIV is both preventable and treatable. UNICEF‚Äôs Unite for Children, Unite against AIDS campaign has four key actions for children; Prevention of new infections, Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), Providing treatment for children, and Protection, care and support. Prevention of new infections As part of a comprehensive HIV prevention response, young people need accurate and relevant information about HIV transmission and a supportive environment where they can talk openly about risk behaviour. They also need to know their HIV status. UNICEF‚Äôs goal is to reduce by 25 per cent the number of young people with HIV globally. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) Without treatment, 15‚Äì30 per cent of babies born to mothers with HIV will themselves get the virus. Around one in two infants who get HIV from their mothers and do not receive treatment die before their second birthday. Many pregnant women are still missing out on treatment. UNICEF hopes to provide services for 80 per cent of all women in need. Providing treatment for children Only a fraction of children living with HIV receive life-saving anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Without treatment, children face a bleak and short-lived future. Current paediatric ARVs are still expensive compared to adult formulas, which are not packaged in child-friendly doses. UNICEF‚Äôs goal is to provide treatment to 80 per cent of children in need. Protection, care and support Children who have lost one or both parents to AIDS face discrimination and stigmatisation. Those living in households with ill or dying parents are often even more vulnerable. Parents with HIV need to be provided with treatment to prevent orphanhood. All children affected by HIV and AIDS need access to health care and education, as well as protection, care and support. UNICEF‚Äôs goal is to provide services that reach 80 per cent of children most in need. Much has been achieved in recent years. For instance: * In 2004, only one in 10 pregnant women with HIV in low and middle-income countries received anti- retroviral medicine. Today, one in three receive medicine. * In 2005, only 75,000 children with HIV received treatment. Today, nearly 200,000 children receive life-saving medicine. * There has been a decline in HIV prevalence among pregnant women age 15‚Äì24 attending antenatal clinics in 14 of the 17 worst-affected countries (with sufficient data). * Increased efforts to protect, care and support children affected by HIV and AIDS. Despite these achievements, much remains to be done. The protection, prevention, treatment and support for children affected by HIV and AIDS remains insufficient. We want to live free from HIV In May 2009, UNICEF UK launched a new phase of the 'Unite for Children, Unite against AIDS' campaign. Focused on preventing infection among adolescents and young people, this campaign is called ‚ÄòWe want to live free from HIV‚Äô. It follows UNICEF UK‚Äôs ‚ÄòBorn Free from HIV‚Äô campaign, which concentrated on the issue of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In 2008, it was estimated that young people aged 15 to 24 accounted for an estimated 45 per cent of new HIV infections worldwide and that almost two young people acquire HIV every minute. On average, only 30 per cent of young men and 19 per cent of young women in developing countries have comprehensive and correct knowledge about HIV and how to avoid transmission. Not enough attention is being given to preventing HIV spreading further among young people around the world. UNICEF UK‚Äôs ‚ÄòWe want to live free from HIV‚Äô campaign aims to raise over ¬£2 million for HIV and AIDS and to remind governments of the importance of effective HIV prevention amongst young people.

Gatacre had a reputation of working his men hard, with his energetic style of leadership leading to subordinate officers often resenting him for not letting them get on with their jobs in their own way.

In civilian usage, a casualty is a person who is killed, wounded or incapacitated by some event; the term is usually used to describe multiple deaths and injuries due to violent incidents or disasters. It is sometimes misunderstood to mean \\"fatalities\\", but non-fatal injuries are also casualties. Military usage In military usage, a casualty is a person in service killed in action, killed by disease, disabled by injuries, disabled by psychological trauma, captured, deserted, or missing, but not someone who sustains injuries which do not prevent them from fighting. Any casualty is no longer available for the immediate battle or campaign, the major consideration in combat; the number of casualties is simply the number of members of a unit who are not available for duty. The word has been used in a military context since at least 1513.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed gives a 1513 reference for military casualty, and an 1844 reference for civilian use Civilian casualties are civilians killed or injured by military personnel or combatants, sometimes instead referred to by the euphemistic expression \\"collateral damage\\". =NATO definitions= The military organisation NATO uses the following definitions: Casualty In relation to personnel, any person who is lost to his organization by reason of being declared dead, wounded, diseased, detained, captured or missing.  Battle casualty Any casualty incurred as the direct result of hostile action, sustained in combat or relating thereto, or sustained going to or returning from a combat mission. Non-battle casualty A person who is not a battle casualty, but who is lost to his organization by reason of disease or injury, including persons dying from disease or injury, or by reason of being missing where the absence does not appear to be voluntary or due to enemy action or to being interned. =Other definitions= These definitions are popular among military historians. Irrecoverable casualty In relation to personnel, any person killed in action, missing in action or who died of wounds or diseases before being evacuated to a medical installation. Medical casualty In relation to personnel, any person incapacitated by wounds sustained or diseases contracted in a combat zone, as well as any person admitted to a medical installation for treatment or recuperation for more than a day. There is a distinction between combat medical casualty and non-combat medical casualty. The former refers to a medical casualty that is a direct result of combat action; the latter refers to a medical casualty that is not a direct result of combat action. Killed in action A casualty classification generally used to describe any person killed by means of the action of hostile forces. Missing in action A casualty classification generally used to describe any person reported missing during combat operations. They may have deserted, or may have been killed, wounded, or taken prisoner. Wounded in action Shell fragment injury, American Civil War A casualty classification generally used to describe any person who has incurred an injury by means of action of hostile forces. Prisoner of war A casualty classification generally used to describe any person captured and held in custody by hostile forces. Civilian usage While the word \\"casualty\\" has been used since 1844 in civilian life, it is a less important concept; the number of deaths on the one hand and serious injuries on the other are separately of major importance, and immediate availability for service is not. These numbers are usually cited together with or instead of total casualties. Incidence =Military and civilian fatalities= According to WHO World health report 2004, deaths from intentional injuries (including war, violence, and suicide) were estimated to be 2.8% of all deaths. In the same report, unintentional injury was estimated to be responsible for 6.2% of all deaths.

The school gains reputation from its strong emphasis on national valuesBantuan Lembaga Perguruan Taman Taruna Nusantara in addition to exceptional academic and leadership achievements.SMA Taruna Nusantara: Nasionalisme Hingga Apresiasi Chris John The school and its teaching method has been referred to as \\"the inspiration for the setting up of other top schools in Indonesia.\\"SMA TN Beri Ilham Berdirinya Sekolah Unggulan Taruna Nusantara can be literally translated as \\"Patriot of The Archipelago.\\" The word Taruna itself also generally refers to Indonesia's military cadet, which has no direct relation to and should not be confused with the school and its students. History The idea for the school was made by then- Indonesian Minister of Defence and Security, Gen. Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani in 1985. He envisioned a civilian school that is able to educate country's best talents and produce graduates who can continue carrying forward the national mission set by the nation's founding fathers.http://www.taruna-nusantara- mgl.sch.id/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=127&Itemid;=47 It was then followed by the signing of MoU by Indonesian Armed Forces and Taman Siswa, which is among the first local and formal educational groups in Indonesia, to set up and support a foundation called Lembaga Perguruan Taman Taruna Nusantara (LPTTN). It is this foundation that eventually crystallised Gen. Moerdani's vision, and subsequently oversaw the operational process of the school. The school was unveiled by the then- Commander of Armed Forces, Gen. Try Sutrisno in 1990. The whole campus, consisted of the school compound, students' dormitories and teachers' housing complex, occupied an 18.5 ha site, donated by the neighboring Indonesian Military Academy. During the first six years, the school admitted 245 male students every year. Starting from 1996, it became a co-ed school by accepting the first batch of 70 female students, and to accommodate this change, the school area was expanded to 23 hectares. To be able to attract outstanding teenagers, the school, backed by the politically and financially strong Armed Forces, offered full scholarship to all students. Its teachers also enjoyed above-average salary and facilities. However, after the severe Asian currency crisis in 1997 and the change of national political landscape thereafter, the school faced financial difficulties and withdrew its scholarship scheme in 2002 or when accepting its thirteenth batch of student. To date, some needy students still receive the scholarship,Beasiswa SMA Taruna Nusantara (TN) Tahun Ajaran 2009-2010 which is sponsored by private corporations, state's departments, local and regional governments,Tempointeraktif.com - SMA Taruna Nusantara Dapat Bantuan Dari 14 BUMN or its alumni.

The school curriculum is no different to the national education curriculum; all students receive the same education as others at senior high school in Indonesia, with additional courses and activities being specifically added to develop nationalism and leadership among the students as emphasized by the founders original goal. Contrary to many public opinions, students graduated from the school do not have any obligation to attend the military academy, and may choose to continue their higher education freely. =Selection process= The school screening process for applicants includes academical, physical and psychological tests, health check and interview. =Curriculum= In delivering its lessons and developing its pupils, the school focuses on the three aspects: nationalism, patriotism, and national culture.

It is the southernmost township in Taiwan. Hengchun is also the only urban township in the southern part of Pingtung County. Hengchun has a land area of and has a population of 30,859 as of December 2014. The city of Hengchun is the entryway to Kenting National Park, the southernmost National Park in the country. With pristine beaches and a vibrant tourist industry, the Hengchun area often attracts more travelers than local residents. The city itself was once completely surrounded by a city wall; now about half of the wall remains intact, as well as the four city gates. On weekends, the streets of nearby Kenting are filled with cars and tour buses. The 2008 Taiwanese film Cape No. 7, the top-grossing film in Taiwan's film history, features Hengchun. Names The area of the modern township was known to the Dutch as Lonkjouw, alternatively spelled Liangkiau, Long-kiau, Longkiau, Loncjou, Lonckjau, Lonckiau, Lonkiauw, Lonckjouw, and Lonckquiouw in early records. The name was borrowed from the Paiwan language of the Paiwan people who lived in the area before the Han Chinese's colonization during 18th century. The Qing viceroy Shen Baozhen noted the equitable climate during his 1875 inspection of Taiwan Island, with the area's crops staying \\"green and prosperous\\" year-round. He began calling the area Hengchun (\\"Always Spring\\") before he left, and the name has remained ever since. Under Japanese rule, the area was known as K≈çshun, from the Japanese pronunciation of the same name. History =Early history= The village of Longkiau was the southernmost town that was occupied by the Dutch on Taiwan Island. The area was mostly occupied by the Paiwan and other Taiwanese aborigines. =Qing Dynasty= After the Rover Incident, wherein shipwrecked American sailors were massacred by the locals, Charles Le Gendre, the US consul at Amoy (Xiamen), visited the area. He found Longkiau at the far point of the curve forming Longkiau Bay. Its population of about 1,500 was \\"mostly engaged in the culture of peanuts, rice, sweet potatoes, a little sugar cane, and also in fishing\\". In response to the 1871 Mudan Incident, wherein shipwrecked Ryukyuan sailors were massacred by the locals, Japanfollowing America's exampleundertook a punitive expedition in 1874. The Japanese landed in Longkiau Bay and pushed north from there. Now aware of the danger of foreign interference and colonization posed by the Qing Empire's refusal to take responsibility for the actions of Taiwan's aborigines, the viceroy of Liangjiang Shen Baozhen toured Taiwan in 1875 in preparation for reform of the island's administration. He ordered attacks against the still restive tribes and began a building program in the southern half of the island which included the fortified lighthouse at Eluanbi. He memorialized on behalf of building a new city in Longkiau (which he gave the more propitious Chinese name \\"Hengchun\\") to accommodate and protect foreign sailors. This request was granted: the portion of Fengshan County south of Fangliao's river became the new Hengchun County and its officials fortified a village south of the old Longkiau as their new county seat. The old location continued to be known as Longkiau.. Taiwan Prefecture originally covered the entire island as part of Fujian Province. When the island became its own province in 1887, Hengchun County formed part of Tainan Prefecture. =Japanese rule= Under Japanese rule, the town was known as K≈çshun. It received a local office (, ch≈ç) in November 1901 and became the seat of its own district in Takao Prefecture in 1920. =Post-war= The Republic of China (ROC) took over Taiwan after World War II. On December 26, 2006, a 7.0‚Äì7.2 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter off the southwest coast of Taiwan occurred (approximately 22.8 km southwest of Hengchun). It caused damage to many houses in Hengchun, including fifteen historical buildings in the historic center of the township.ÊÅÜÊò•Âè§Âüé ÂüéÂÄí15Â∫ß, UDN, Taiwan, 2006-12-27 Two casualties were reported, with many more injured. It was the strongest earthquake to hit Hengchun in one hundred years.2 KILLED IN STRONGEST EARTHQUAKE IN HENGCHUN IN 100 YEARS , Central News Agency, Taiwan, 2006-12-27 Geography Hengchun is the southernmost administrative division of the island. It is bordered to the northwest by Checheng Township and to the northeast by Manzhou Township. =Climate= Hengchun is well known for its tropical monsoon climate with warm temperatures year round, as befits its name. It usually has neither a cool winter nor an extremely hot summer, with average monthly mean temperatures ranging between 21 and 28 degrees Celsius. The climate is generally divided into two seasons, the cooler and drier season and the warmer and wetter season. During the cool and dry season from early December to late March of the following year, precipitation are relatively low with temperatures ranging from 18-26 Degrees Celsius, occasional cold fronts can drop both the day and the night time temperatures by around 2-4 ¬∞C, while temperatures during a clear sunny day can reach as high as 28-30 ¬∞C. During the warm and wet season temperature range from 24‚Äì32 degrees Celsius with a relatively abundant rainfall especially from May‚ÄìOctober, when Taiwan is affected by the Pacific typhoon season. Hengchun's spring-like climate is very much dictated by its location surrounded by the ocean, resulting in a noticeably smaller difference between the day and night temperatures than most other townships of Pingtung. Hengchun is usually cooler than other townships in the county during daytime and warmer than others during the night, especially during the winter months, when daily lows usually hovers around 18-20 degrees Celsius at Hengchun and around 15-18 at Pingtung city, while daily highs usually hovers around 24-26 degrees Celsius at the township and 25-28 at Pingtung City. Temperatures dips below 15 degrees Celsius on average once every 3 years, mostly on early mornings of January when Taiwan is affected by a cold front. The climate is also supportive of tropical rainforests (tropical monsoon rainforest) which occupied the entire Hengchun peninsula, while palm trees and other tropical vegetation grows on the coastlines, much like the rest of Pingtung. Administrative divisions Hengchun Township office The township comprises 17 villages: Chengbei, Chengnan, Chengxi, Daguang, Dehe, Eluan, Jiahu, Kending, Longshui, Nanwan, Renshou, Shanhai, Shanjiao, Shuiquan, Sigou, Tougou and Wangsha.

In 1988, an actual measurement of the length was conducted, showing that the length in total amount to . The peak season of tourism in Hengchun usually lasts from April to late October when daytime temperatures are usually hot, while the off season lasts from November to March of the following year, with the exception of the week of the Chinese New Year holiday which usually takes place during late January or February, when large amount of tourist from around the whole country, mostly from Northern Taiwan travels to Hengchun and Kenting for the peninsula's warm weather. =Festivals= * Pingtung Picturesque Rice Field Life Festival *Folk Music Festival Transportation Hengchun Airport The township was served by Hengchun Airport, with domestic flights from Taipei Songshan Airport in Taipei.

He ruled as an enlightened despot, and raised money by renting soldiers (called \\"Hessians\\") to Great Britain to help fight the American Revolutionary War. He combined Enlightenment ideas with Christian values, cameralist plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward international diplomacy.Charles W. Ingrao, The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760‚Äì1785 (2003) Early life Frederick was born at Kassel in Hesse, the son of William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and his wife Dorothea Wilhelmine of Saxe-Zeitz. His paternal grandfather was Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, and his paternal uncle was Frederick I of Sweden. His education was initially entrusted to Colonel August Moritz von Donop and then from 1726 to 1733 to the Swiss theologian and philosopher, Jean-Pierre de Crousaz. Marriages and children On 8 May 1740, by proxy in London, and on 28 June 1740 in person in Kassel, Frederick married Princess Mary, fourth daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach. They had four sons: # William (25 December 1741 ‚Äì 1 July 1742) # William I, Elector of Hesse (3 June 1743 - 27 February 1821) # Charles (19 December 1744 - 17 August 1836) # Frederick (11 September 1747 - 20 May 1837), father of Prince William of Hesse-Kassel and grandfather of Queen Louise of Denmark. In December 1745, Frederick landed in Scotland with 6000 Hessian troops to support his father-in-law, George II of Great Britain, in dealing with the Jacobite rising. Although he supported the \\"Protestant succession\\" in Great Britain on this occasion, Frederick later converted from Calvinism to Catholicism. In February 1749, Frederick and his father visited the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, Clemens August of Bavaria, who received Frederick into the Catholic Church. Despite his exertions in support of her father, Frederick's marriage with the British princess was not a happy one. The couple were living apart from each other by 1747, and were formally separated in 1755. Mary moved to Denmark the following year, to care for the children of her late sister Louise of Great Britain, who had died in 1751. All three of the couple's surviving sons moved with Mary to Denmark. Two of them, including Frederick's heir William, later married Danish princesses, their first cousins. The younger sons lived permanently in Denmark, rising to high office in the court of their cousin; only William returned to Germany upon inheriting the principality of Hanau. He also later succeeded Frederick as Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. Mary died in 1772, and Frederick lost little time in marrying again. On 10 January 1773, at Berlin, he married Margravine Philippine, daughter of Frederick William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt and Sophia Dorothea of Prussia. No children were born of this marriage. Ruler After being formally separated from his wife in 1755, Friedrich entered active service in the Prussian military. In 1760, he succeeded his father as Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. Despite Frederick's Catholicism, the principality remained Calvinist, and Frederick's children were raised as Protestants in Denmark. During the 17th and 18th centuries, it was a fairly widespread practice for smaller principalities to rent out troops to other princes. However, the practise was carried to excess in Hesse-Kassel, which maintained 7% of its entire population under arms throughout the eighteenth century.Tilly, Charles \\"Coercion, Capital, and European States.\\" Frederick hired out so many troops to his nephew, King George III of Great Britain, for use in the American War of Independence, that \\"Hessian\\" has become an American term for all German soldiers deployed by the British in the War. Frederick used the revenue to finance his patronage of the arts and his opulent lifestyle. The architect Simon Louis du Ry transformed for Frederick II. the town of Kassel into a modern capital. Landgrave Frederick II died in 1785 at Castle Wei√üenstein, Kassel. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, William. Ancestry References Further reading *Charles W.

It was believed to be an eastern race of the Mediterranean gull until 1971 and was traditionally placed in the genus Larus. Description The gull is 44 to 45 cm long with a stocky, thick body. Non-breeding adults feature uniformly dark-smudged ear-coverts and hind crown, white-tipped wings, prominent, isolated black subterminal markings on outer primaries, and no white leading edge to outer wing. Breeding birds have black hoods (including napes) with grey-brown foreheads, and broad, white, half-moon colouring behind, below, and above their eyes. Their legs are orange and their bills scarlet. The name comes from its status as a relict species.Ming Ma, Ying Chen, Kedeerhan Bayahen, Baowen Hu, Fei Li, Jiaqing Wu, Xiang Gao, Yu Mei, \\"Seasonal changes in the number of Relict Gull (Larus relictus) at Ebinur Lake, Western China\\", Journal of Arid Land, 2010, volume 2, number 2, pp 151‚àí155, Retrieved May 2, 2015 Distribution and habitat The gull breeds in several locations in Mongolia (e.g., Galuut Lake, Khukh Lake, and Chukh Lake), two in Kazakhstan, one in Russia, and one in China (Lake Hongjiannao). Small numbers appear to migrate to South Korea during the nonbreeding period. There is additional evidence that larger numbers may migrate to eastern China as well, but this is not verified. The gulls breed in colonies on islands in saltwater lakes. These sites are fragile. Nesting does not occur when lakes dry up or when water levels are too high. When islands become too small or overgrown with vegetation or so large that they join at the shore, the birds do not nest either. During non-breeding periods, the birds can be found on estuarine mud and sandflats. Status and conservation The population is estimated to be at 10,000 or less, with numbers dropping. It is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" on the IUCN Red List. Its greatest threats are changes of water level in the breeding lakes, predation from other gulls, hailstorms and flooding. Human disturbance has increased their vulnerability to all these factors, resulting in further risks for the adult gulls and increased mortality for chicks and eggs. To combat this, nature reserves in Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russia have been established, for example in the Mongol Daguur region.

She is often called the \\"Sahrawi Gandhi\\" or \\"Sahrawi Pasionaria\\" for her nonviolent protests. She is the president of the Collective of Sahrawi Human Rights Defenders (CODESA). She was imprisoned from 1987 to 1991 and from 2005 to 2006 on charges related to her independence advocacy. In 2009, she attracted international attention when she staged a hunger strike in Lanzarote Airport after being denied re-entry into Moroccan Western Sahara. Haidar has won several international human rights awards for her work, including the 2008 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, 2009 Civil Courage Prize and 2019 Right Livelihood Award.  Background  While her parents lived in Laayoune, a small city in Western Sahara with significant Sahrawi population (and former Spanish Cape Juby) where she passed her childhood, Aminatou was born in 1966 in Laayoune, Western Sahara, her grandmother's town, due to a bedouin tradition. She is not member of the Polisario Front, although she considers the movement as the only representative of the Sahrawi people.Eduardo Soto Trillo, Viaje al abandono ‚Äì Por qu√© no dejan al S√°hara ser libre, Aguilar, 2011, page 369. She is divorced with two children, Hayat and Mohammed.  1987‚Äì1991 forced disappearance  In 1987, Haidar participated in a nonviolent demonstration against Moroccan administration of Western Sahara. Along with many other attendees, she was subjected to forced disappearance by Moroccan authorities and held without trial until 1991, when she was released. According to Kerry Kennedy of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, Haidar was \\"gagged, starved, sleep deprived, subjected to electric shock, severely beaten ‚Äì and worse\\" during her imprisonment. Moroccan authorities gave no explanation for her detention. Amnesty International (AI) stated that she appeared to have been held for her peaceful advocacy for Western Sahara self- determination.  2005‚Äì2006 imprisonment  Aminatou Haidar with friends in Lemleihess (Western Sahara), after her release from prison (18 January 2006) On 17 June 2005, Haidar was attacked by police on her way to a demonstration in El Aai√∫n for the Western Sahara Independence Intifada. After admission to Belmehdi Hasan hospital and receiving twelve stitches for a head injury, she was arrested on charges of \\"participation in violent protest activities and incitement\\" and \\"belonging to an unauthorized association\\". She was then held in El Aai√∫n's Black Prison. She reportedly went on hunger strike from 8 August to 29 September to demand an investigation into torture allegations by fellow Saharawi detainees Houssein Lidri and Brahim Noumria as well as improved conditions of detention. On 14 December, she was sentenced to seven months in prison by the El Aai√∫n Court of Appeal. AI, which had sent an observer to cover the trial, declared that \\"the trial ... may have been unfair. The organization is consequently strengthened in its belief that the seven human rights defenders may be prisoners of conscience\\". The European Parliament also called for her immediate release along with that of Ali Salem Tamek and 37 other \\"political prisoners\\" in a 27 October 2005 resolution. On 17 January 2006, Aminatou Haidar was released at the end of her sentence. She stated that \\"the joy is incomplete without the release of all Saharawi political prisoners, and without the liberation of all the territories of the homeland still under the occupation of the oppressor\\".  2009 Lanzarote Airport hunger strike  On 13 November 2009, Haidar was detained by Moroccan authorities at the airport in El-Aai√∫n when she attempted to return from a trip to Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, Spain, to collect a prize. Under citizenship, she had refused to state her nationality as \\"Moroccan\\". The authorities denied her re- entry, confiscated her passport, and sent her back to the Canary Islands without it. Two Spanish journalists who had accompanied her were also detained for several hours. A Moroccan official called her refusal to call herself Moroccan as \\"an act of treason\\" and stated that Haidar would not be allowed to return to El-Aai√∫n until she apologized. The Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s later published documents demonstrating that the Moroccan government made three different flight reservations for Haidar prior to her return, indicating that they had planned to expel her in advance. On arriving at Lanzarote Airport, Haidar began a hunger strike. She accused Spanish officials of holding her against her will by not allowing her to return to Western Sahara without a passport. On 17 November, the airport management firm Aena filed charges against her for disturbing the public order. She was required to attend court in Arrecife and fined 180 euros. = International support = UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called on 9 December for Morocco to allow Haidar to return. Human Rights Watch stated that Morocco \\"must reverse its expulsion of Sahrawi rights activist Aminatou Haidar and allow her to enter her country of nationality\\". while Amnesty International condemned her expulsion as part of a pattern of \\"growing intolerance\\" by the Moroccan government. A number of activists and celebrities also expressed support for Haidar during her strike. Portuguese Nobel Prize-winning writer Jos√© Saramago, who owned a home in Lanzarote, sent her a letter in November stating that \\"If I were in Lanzarote, I would be with you\\". On 1 December, he met her at the airport, stating, \\"It's time for the international community to pressure Morocco to comply with the accords about the Sahara\\". Argentinian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel asked for a \\"humanitarian and political exit\\" for Haidar, and called on the Spanish and Moroccan governments to undertake dialogue to see \\"in what ways could the European Union, Council of Europe or even the United Nations intervene to avoid a tragic outcome and try to save her life, but not at any cost.\\" British filmmakers Ken Loach and Paul Laverty compared Haidar to U.S. civil rights activist Rosa Parks, stating, \\"What tragedy would be for the non-violent resistance, and for the possibility of a pacific solution, that we let her die.\\" Statements of support were also issued by Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, Spanish actor Javier Bardem, US Senator Jim Inhofe, Guatemalan Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Mench√∫, British musician Brian Eno, and Spanish novelist Alberto V√°zquez-Figueroa. On 29 November, a group of Spanish singers and musicians gave a free concert in support of Haidar in Rivas-Vaciamadrid, on the outskirts of Madrid. Performers included Bebe, Kiko Veneno, Macaco, Amaral, Pedro Guerra, Mariem Hassan, Conchita, Miguel R√≠os, and Ismael Serrano. On 10 December, dozens of artists and activists sent an open letter to Juan Carlos I of Spain, asking him to intercede for Haidar with Morocco. Signatories included three Nobel laureates ‚Äì G√ºnter Grass, Dario Fo, and Saramago ‚Äì as well as Pedro Almod√≥var, Mario Vargas Llosa, Pen√©lope Cruz, Antonio Gala, Almudena Grandes, Carlos Fuentes, and Ignacio Ramonet among others from India, Puerto Rico, Portugal, Colombia, Brazil and Angola. = Diplomatic resolution = Spanish foreign minister Miguel √Ångel Moratinos offered to arrange a Spanish passport for Haidar, but she refused his offer, demanding the return of her original passport. A Moroccan delegation led by the President of the Moroccan Senate, Mohamed Cheikh Biadillah, visited Spain in early December 2009. Biadillah stated that the Sahrawi people are fully integrated into Moroccan society and occupy some of the highest offices in Moroccan institutions, and that no country would accept the return of a person who had \\"thrown away their passport\\" and \\"has renounced their nationality\\". By 7 December, three weeks into her hunger strike, Haidar had become too weak to stand and slipped in and out of consciousness. A Lanzarote Hospital doctor reported that she might have only hours to live. Spain attempted again to apply for her re-entry to the country, but backed down when Morocco threatened to end cooperation on illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other issues. On 11 December, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also contacted the Moroccan Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri to request Haidar's re-entry. On 17 December, after being unable to swallow liquid for two days, Haidar was admitted to the hospital. She continued to refuse to break her fast. Late that night, Moroccan authorities relented, and Haidar was allowed on a plane back to El-Aai√∫n. The Spanish foreign ministry attributed the resolution to \\"a co-ordinated effort between Spain, France and the US\\" to persuade Moroccan government that its refusal to re-admit Haidar was counterproductive. Appearing before a crowd in the El- Aai√∫n airport, Haidar stated, \\"This is a triumph, a victory for human rights, for international justice and for the cause of Western Sahara ... And it's all thanks to your pressure.\\" Moroccan officials stated that the government was \\"committed to respecting human rights in Western Sahara and elsewhere in the country\\" but refused to comment on Haidar's case. Upon her return, Haidar was placed under house arrest by Moroccan police, and journalists were blocked from speaking with her.  Post hunger-strike work  On 19 January 2010, Haidar returned to Spain to have medical exams in La Paz hospital in Madrid. Haidar has a Spanish residence card since her 2006 release. Haidar was in poor health, as she suffered anaemia and stomach ulcer, consequence of her imprisonment and the 2009 hunger strike. Amnesty International reported that Haidar and her family were under constant surveillance by Moroccan security forces and were being harassed and intimidated by them. On 7 March, Haidar spoke at a conference at the University of Granada during a European Union- Morocco summit in the same city. Haidar stated that the summit \\"denied the suffering of the Sahrawis\\" and that the EU was appeasing the \\"totalitarian regime\\" of Morocco, sacrificing human rights in favor of economic interests. On 24 March, Haidar started during a visit to Washington, D.C. that \\"before reaching a final settlement, a political solution, we must put pressure on Morocco to respect human rights\\". In meeting with US Department of State officials and US representatives, she urged them to pressure Morocco for Sahrawi rights. On 15 October, Haidar appeared in a Casablanca court with dozens of Sahrawi activist leaders and twenty foreign observers, during the trial of seven Sahrawi activists (known as \\"The Casablanca 7\\"). The \\"Casablanca 7\\" had been detained months before after travelling to the Sahrawi refugee camps, and were accused by the Moroccan government of threatening the safety of the state. One of them was Ali Salem Tamek, vice president of Haidar's human rights association CODESA. She said that Moroccan government accusations had no foundation and denounced them as violations of the freedom of expression and of travel of the detained. She also criticized the Spanish government, which she accused of being guilty in the Sahrawi people's situation: \\"The Spanish government violate international law by denying the Saharawi people their legitimate right to self-determination\\". On 29 October 2011, Haidar's son was threatened with sexual violation and a beating that would cause him permanent disability by a couple of Moroccan policemen in El Aaiun, according to CODESA. On 8 July 2012, Sahrawi human rights sources stated that Haidar's children had been physically injured by some Moroccan passengers when they were travelling by bus from Agadir to El Aaiun. Human rights groups as the Sahrawi ASVDH and the North-American Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights condemned the aggression, calling for an investigation. On 1 November 2012, the same day she met UN Special Commissioner for the Western Sahara Christopher Ross at El Aaiun MINURSO HQ, Haidar stated that she had been later attacked by Moroccan police during a non-violent protest.

The vastus medialis is part of the quadriceps muscle group. Structure * The vastus medialis is a muscle present in the anterior compartment of thigh, and is one of the four muscles that make up the quadriceps muscle. The others are the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius and rectus femoris. It is the most medial of the \\"vastus\\" group of muscles. The vastus medialis arises medially along the entire length of the femur, and attaches with the other muscles of the quadriceps in the quadriceps tendon. * The vastus medialis muscle originates from a continuous line of attachment on the femur, which begins on the front and middle side (anteromedially) on the intertrochanteric line of the femur. It continues down and back (posteroinferiorly) along the pectineal line and then descends along the inner (medial) lip of the linea aspera and onto the medial supracondylar line of the femur. The fibers converge onto the inner (medial) part of the quadriceps tendon and the inner (medial) border of the patella. * The obliquus genus muscle is the most distal segment of the vastus medialis muscle. Its specific training plays an important role in maintaining patella position and limiting injuries to the knee. With no clear delineation, it is simply the most distal group of fibers of the vastus medialis. Function The vastus medialis is one of four muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh. It is involved in knee extension, along with the other muscles which make up the quadriceps muscle. The vastus medialis also contributes to correct tracking of the patella. A division of the vastus medialis muscle into two groups of fibers has been hypothesized, a long and relatively inline group of fibres with the quadriceps ligament, the vastus medialis longus; and a shorter and more obliquely oriented with group of fibres, the vastus medialis obliquus. There is as yet insufficient evidence to conclusively confirm or deny this hypothesis. Clinical significance =Knee pain= Knee pain is thought to be primarily associated with specific quadriceps muscle weakness or fatigue, especially in the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO). It is known that fatigue can be caused by many different mechanisms, ranging from the accumulation of metabolites within muscle fibers to the generation of an inadequate motor command in the motor cortex. Characteristics of the vastus medialis, including its angle of insertion, correlate with presence of knee joint pain (patellofemoral pain syndrome). However, this syndrome is complex and definitive evidence of causality has not yet been published. Misfiring and fatiguing of the VMO causes mal-tracking of the patella and subsequent damage to surrounding structures creating increased force on the knees, often resulting in injuries such as patellofemoral pain syndrome, anterior cruciate ligament rupture, chondromalacia, and tendinitis. Through the use of electromyography, researchers can evaluate and record the electrical activity produced by the skeletal muscle of the VMO to analyze the biomechanics and detect any possible abnormalities, weakness, or fatigue. With an analysis of muscle activity of the VMO through the use of electromyography, proper rehabilitative plans and goals can be established to not only correct the already established abnormality, but even prevent such injuries if tested sooner. Preventing injuries is crucial as well as teaching proper training techniques to ensure there are no valgus collapse forces causing unplanned stress on other structures of the knee, causing asymmetry, and predisposing that individual for injury.

Under this test, the product is considered defective if a reasonable consumer would find it defective. As an example, a reasonable consumer might find exposed blades on a lawnmower, without plastic guards that could be installed for pennies, to be defective because the risk of not having the plastic guards is higher than the costs of installing those guards. The test is mostly applied to non-complex products about which consumers might have expectations. For example, the consumer might not have specific safety expectations about the design of landing gear on an airplane except for the fact that they do not expect to crash while taking the plane. A closely related test is risk-utility test. Traditionally, the risk- utility test was used for design defects, while the consumer expectation test was applied to manufacturing defects. However, some jurisdictions apply the consumer expectation test to design defects as well. See Calles v. Scripto- Tokai Corp., 2007 WL 495315 (Ill. Feb. 16, 2007). Official definition of consumer expectation test: An unreasonably dangerous product is one that is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community of its characteristics. This test is commonly applied in product liability cases in the United States.

After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajput principalities, these principalities were later conquered by Maratha Empire and Sikh Empire. The name Kullu derives from the word \\"Kulant Peeth\\", meaning \\"end of the habitable world\\". As per legends, during the Great Flood, Manu visited this valley but was unable to cross the Rohtang pass. He named the last settlement he found as Kulant Peeth and chose to settle and meditate in what has now become the town of Manali (Manu's Place). The name further devolved into \\"Kulut\\", as the kingdom was known for a long time; before finally being known by the current name of Kullu or Kulu. The Buddhist pilgrim monk Xuanzang visited the Kullu Valley in 634 or 635 CE. He described it as a fertile region completely surrounded by mountains, about 3,000 li in circuit, with a capital 14 or 15 li in circumference. It contained a Stupa built by Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, which is said to mark the place where the Buddha preached to the local people and made conversions, Stupa was taken away by a Mughal ruler and put in Feroz shah Kotla maidan in Delhi. There were some twenty Buddhist monasteries, with about 1,000 monks, most of whom were Mahayanist. There were also some fifteen Hindu temples, and people of both faiths lived mixed together. There were meditation caves near the mountain passes inhabited by both Buddhist and Hindu practitioners. The country is said to have produced gold, silver, red copper, crystal lenses and bell-metal.Watters (1904-1905), pp. 298, 335. Kullu got its first motorable access only after Indian Independence.

The main purpose of the Act is to partially compensate the nuclear industry against liability claims arising from nuclear incidents while still ensuring compensation coverage for the general public. The Act establishes a no fault insurance-type system in which the first approximately $12.6 billion (as of 2011) is industry-funded as described in the Act. Any claims above the $12.6 billion would be covered by a Congressional mandate to retroactively increase nuclear utility liability or would be covered by the federal government. At the time of the Act's passing, it was considered necessary as an incentive for the private production of nuclear power ‚Äî this was because electric utilities viewed the available liability coverage (only $60 million) as inadequate.Price-Anderson Act. Nuclear Power Pro/Con. Retrieved on 2011-03-21. In 1978, the Act survived a constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court case Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group (see below). The Act was last renewed in 2005 for a 20-year period. How the law works =Funding and procedures= Power reactor licensees are required by the act to obtain the maximum amount of insurance against nuclear related incidents which is available in the insurance market (, $450 million per reactor). Any monetary claims that fall within this maximum amount are paid by the insurer(s). The Price-Anderson fund, which is financed by the reactor companies themselves, is then used to make up the difference. As of September, 2013, each reactor company is obliged to contribute up to $121,255,000 per reactor in the event of an accident with claims that exceed the $450 million insurance limit. , the maximum amount of the fund is approximately $12.61 billion ($121,255,000 X 104 reactors) if all of the reactor companies were required to pay their full obligation to the fund. This fund is not paid into unless an accident occurs. However, fund administrators are required to have contingency plans in place to raise funds using loans to the fund, so that claimants may be paid as soon as possible. Actual payments by companies in the event of an accident are capped at $18,963,000 per year until either a claim has been met, or their maximum individual liability (the $121,255,000 maximum) has been reached.United States Code: Title 42,2210. Indemnification and limitation of liability  LII / Legal Information Institute. Law.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2011-03-21.http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=NRC-2008-0512 This results in a maximum combined primary+secondary coverage amount of up to $13.06 billion for a hypothetical single-reactor incident. If a coverable incident occurs, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is required to submit a report on the cost of it to the courts and to Congress. If claims are likely to exceed the maximum Price-Anderson fund value, then the President is required to submit proposals to Congress. These proposals must detail the costs of the accident, recommend how funds should be raised, and detail plans for full and prompt compensation to those affected. Under the Act, the administrators of the fund have the right to further charge plants if it is needed. If Congress fails to provide for compensation, claims can be made under the Tucker Act (in which the government waives its sovereign immunity) for failure by the federal government to carry out its duty to compensate claimants. Price-Anderson also covers Department of Energy (DOE) facilities, private licensees, and their subcontractors including the USEC uranium enrichment plants, national laboratories and the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. Any payments from the fund for accidents arising at DOE facilities come from the US treasury. The fund size for such installations is set by legislation (also at $12.6 billion), rather than being based upon the number of plants contributing to the fund. Since Price-Anderson was enacted, nuclear insurance pools have paid out about $151 million ($70 million of which was related to the 1979 Three Mile Island accident) in claims, while the Department of Energy has paid out $65 million. = Alterations to normal civil court procedures = The Act makes a number of changes to typical civil court procedures: *Jurisdiction is automatically transferred to federal courts no matter where the accident occurred. *All claims from the same incident are consolidated into one Federal court, which is responsible for prioritizing payouts and sharing funds equitably should there be a shortfall. *Companies are expressly forbidden to defend any action for damages on the grounds that an incident was not their fault. *An open-ended time limit is applied, which allows claimants three years to file a claim starting from the time they discover damage. *Individuals are not allowed to claim punitive damages against companies. (The act makes no provision for punishing companies responsible for an incident, but nuclear licensing regulations specify fines for breaches of safety regulations and criminal charges apply unaffected.) History of the Act = Origins = The Price-Anderson Act is named for Representative Charles Melvin Price (D-Ill.) and Senator Clinton Presba Anderson (D-N.M.), both of whom eventually chaired Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which followed the development of nuclear technology during World War II, had created a framework for operation of nuclear plants under government control. The intention of the government was to apply this technology to civilian industry, especially in using nuclear plants to generate electricity. In 1954 the Atomic Energy Act Amendments Act removed the government monopoly on operating nuclear plants by creating a licensing system for private operators. The structure of the insurance industry as it existed until 1955 was incapable of providing the extent of coverage needed to adequately address the risks of nuclear power. The \\"amount of insurance required could not be underwritten at the time by any single or joint company effort\\".John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk, Transaction Publishers, p. 89. A power plant, Shippingport, was eventually constructed, but electric utility executives expressed concerns about limited size of liability coverage offered by the insurance market ($60 million). A nuclear accident of privately held nuclear power appeared to be an impossible barrier since the possible magnitude of claims could bankrupt any electric utility held responsible. Nor could an insurance company offer insurance policies with limits beyond its own resources to pay. Because of these difficulties, it looked like it would be extremely unlikely that electric utilities would want to enter the nuclear power industry. The potential magnitude of worst-case accidents has been the subject of several major studies, such as WASH-740, WASH-1400, CRAC-II, and NUREG-1150. In November 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analyses (SOARCA), which examines potential safety failures with probabilities of \\"occurring more than once in a million reactor years, or more than once in ten million reactor years for accidents that may bypass containment features.\\" To address these issues, Congress introduced the Price-Anderson Act in 1957. The Act required companies to obtain the maximum possible insurance coverage against accidents, determined to be $60 million, and provided a further government commitment of $500 million to cover any claims in excess of the private insurance. Companies were relieved of any liability beyond the insured amount for any incident involving radiation or radioactive releases regardless of fault or cause. The act was intended to be temporary, and to expire in August 1967 as it was assumed that once the companies had demonstrated a record of safe operation they would be able to obtain insurance in the private market. At the same time, Congress encouraged the insurance industry to develop a way that power plant operators could meet their financial protection responsibilities. The insurance industry responded by creating an insurance pool called American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), which today includes 60 U.S. property and casualty insurance companies who represent some of the largest insurance companies in the country.History . Amnucins.com (2001-09-11). Retrieved on 2011-03-21. = Extensions = By 1966 it had become apparent that the industry would still be unable to obtain adequate private insurance, so the act was extended until 1976. A provision was added to the Act which prevented companies from offering certain defenses to damages claims (particularly defenses which claimed that the accident had not been their fault). A minimum time limit was also introduced (which could be surpassed by state law), giving claimants three years after discovering harm in which to make a claim. The alterations were intended to make the process of obtaining funds from reactor companies easier, and to remove discrepancies in different states where different laws applied. The new provisions only applied to incidents where a significant escape of radioactive material was deemed to have occurred (an ENO, extraordinary nuclear occurrence). In 1975 the act was extended for 12 years, up until 1987. The total amount of insurance remained the same, but a provision was added requiring each of the 60 or so reactors then in existence to contribute between $2 million and $5 million in the event of an uninsured accident. The insurance ceiling for each individual company was increased to $140 million. These measures eliminated the contribution of the federal government to the insurance pool. However, an explicit commitment was made that in the event of a larger accident, Congress would take whatever actions were necessary to provide full and prompt claims to the public. This included the possibility of additional charges to reactor companies above and beyond the prescribed limits set forth in the Act. In 1988 the act was extended for 15 years up to August 2002. Individual insurance for each generator was increased to $200 million, and the total fund to $9.5 billion. For each reactor owned, the reactor company was liable to contribute up to $63 million towards compensation for any claim against any company, though this could only be recovered at a maximum rate of $10 million per year. Assessments were to be adjusted for inflation every 5 years. The same level of indemnity was provided for government DOE facilities, while small reactors (education and research oriented) were required to obtain $250,000 insurance and have a government- backed pool of $500 million in the event of accident. This extension provided that all cases resulting from a nuclear accident to be heard in a federal court, rather than local courts. In February 2002 the act was temporarily extended to December 2003. After some debate in 2003, the Act was extended to 2017. The individual insurance for each site was increased to $300 million while fund contributions per reactor were increased to $95.8 million. In 2005 it was extended again through 2025 via the Energy Policy Act of 2005. = Usage = Over the first 43 years of the Price-Anderson Act to 2000, the secondary insurance was not required. A total of $151 million was paid to cover claims (including legal expenses), all from primary insurance, including $71 million for Three Mile Island. Additionally, the Department of Energy paid about $65 million to cover claims under liability for its own nuclear operations in the same period.NRC: Fact Sheet on Nuclear Insurance and Disaster Relief Funds. Nrc.gov. Retrieved on 2011-03-21.  Constitutional challenge  The constitutionality of the Price-Anderson Act was upheld in June, 1978 by the Supreme Court in the case of Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group link. The lawsuit challenged the act on two grounds ‚Äî first, that it violated the Fifth Amendment because it did not ensure adequate compensation for victims of accidents, and that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment because it treats nuclear accidents differently from other accidents. The court concluded: *It is clear that Congress' purpose was to remove the economic impediments in order to stimulate the private development of electric energy by nuclear power while simultaneously providing the public compensation in the event of a catastrophic nuclear incident. *The record supports the need for the imposition of a statutory limit on liability to encourage private industry participation and hence bears a rational relationship to Congress' concern for stimulating private industry's involvement in the production of nuclear electric energy. *The Price-Anderson Act does, in our view, provide a reasonably just substitute for the common-law or state tort law remedies it replaces. *The District Court's finding that the Act tends to encourage irresponsibility in matters of safety and environmental protection cannot withstand careful scrutiny, since nothing in the liability- limitation provision undermines or alters the rigor and integrity of the process involved in the review of applications for a license to construct or operate a nuclear power plant, and since, in the event of a nuclear accident the utility itself would probably suffer the largest damages. *We view the congressional assurance of a [then] $560 million fund for recovery, accompanied by an express statutory commitment, to \\"take whatever action is deemed necessary [438 U.S. 59, 91] and appropriate to protect the public from the consequences of\\" a nuclear accident, 42 U.S.C. 2210 (e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), to be a fair and reasonable substitute for the uncertain recovery of damages of this magnitude from a utility or component manufacturer, whose resources might well be exhausted at an early stage. *There is no equal protection violation, since the general rationality of the Act's liability limitation, particularly with reference to the congressional purpose of encouraging private participation in the exploitation of nuclear energy, is ample justification for the difference in treatment between those injured in nuclear accidents and those whose injuries are derived from other causes. Compared to other industries US law requires payment of 8 cents per barrel of oil to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for all oil imported or produced. In exchange for the payment, operators of offshore oil platforms, among others, are limited in liability to $75 million for damages, which can be paid by the fund, but are not indemnified from the cost of cleanup. As of 2010, before payouts related to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion, the fund stood at $1.6 billion.New York Times. Tax on Oil May Help Pay for Cleanup. May 1, 2010. The hydroelectric industry is not generally held financially liable for catastrophic incidents such as dam failure or resultant flooding. For example, dam operators were not held liable for the 1977 failure of the Teton Dam in Idaho that caused approximately $500 million in property damage.Meehan, Taylor. \\"Lessons from the Price-Anderson nuclear industry indemnity act for future clean energy compensatory models.\\" Conn. Ins. LJ 18 (2011): 339. While many industries have no explicit liability cap, in practice, liability in such industries may be limited to the assets of the company held to be at fault. In addition, liability can be disputed in the absence of strict liability laws. As a non-power example, after the 1984 Bhopal disaster, the Union Carbide Corporation claimed the accident was caused by sabotage and settled for only $470 million. Criticisms The Price- Anderson Act has been criticized by various think tanks and environmental organizations, including Union of Concerned Scientists, Greenpeace International, Public Citizen and the Cato Institute. Public Citizen has been particularly critical of Price-Anderson; it claims that the Act understates the risks inherent in atomic power, does not require reactors to carry adequate insurance, and would therefore result in taxpayers footing most of the bill for a catastrophic accident. An analysis by economists Heyes and Heyes (1998) places the value of the government insurance subsidy at $2.3 million per reactor-year, or $237 million annually.Geoffrey S. Rothwell Does the US Subsidize Nuclear Power Insurance?, Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, January 2002 In 2008 the Congressional Budget Office estimated the value of the subsidy at only $600,000 per reactor per year, or less than one percent of the levelized cost for new nuclear capacity.Nuclear Power's Role in Generating Electricity, pp. 28-29. (PDF). Retrieved on 2014-11-17. All such calculations are controversial, as they rely on the difficult assessment of extrapolating what the \\"true\\" probabilities are of a catastrophic event at the extreme cost brackets. Due to the structure of the liability immunities, as the number of nuclear plants in operation is reduced, the public liability in case of an accident goes up. However going in the other direction, the Nuclear Waste Fund was/is used to transfer $750 million in fee revenues each year from utilities to the Government and this is hard currency, unlike the conceptual insurance/indemnity Act.\\\\- Draft Report to the Secretary of Energy Future . Blue Ribbon Commission on America‚Äôs Nuclear: July 29, 2011.Matthew L. Wald, Energy Dept. Told to Stop Collecting Nuclear Waste Fee, The New York Times, November 20, 2013, p. A20 (retrieved April 2, 2014) The Price-Anderson Act has been used as an example of corporate welfare by Ralph Nader. Price-Anderson has been criticized by many of these groups due to a portion of the Act that indemnifies Department of Energy and private contractors from nuclear incidents even in cases of gross negligence and willful misconduct (although criminal penalties would still apply). \\"No other government agency provides this level of taxpayer indemnification to non- government personnel\\".Public Citizen  Energy Program  Energy Program ‚Äì Price-Anderson Reauthorization in H.R.6: An Insurance Scam for the Nuclear Industry.

These beyond-insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power, as hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the Banqiao Dam disaster, or large dam failures in general.

The film stars Camilla Belle, Brian Geraghty, Katie Cassidy, and Clark Gregg. Belle plays a babysitter who starts to receive threatening phone calls from an unidentified stranger, played by both Tommy Flanagan and Lance Henriksen. The film is a remake of Fred Walton's 1979 horror film of the same name, which became a cult classic for its legendary opening 20 minutes, which this remake extends to a feature-length film. The film was theatrically released on February 3, 2006, and was universally panned by critics upon release. It grossed over $66.9 million worldwide on a $15 million budget. Plot To pay off going over her cellphone minutes, Jill Johnson has agreed to babysit for the wealthy Mandrakis family. When she arrives at the house, the parents show her around and tell her about their live-in housemaid, Rosa. While the two children are asleep upstairs, Jill soon begins to receive anonymous phone calls from a stranger who, most of the time, doesn't say anything and then hangs up. She initially believes it is her friends playing a prank but when she calls them, they deny it. Jill's friend Tiffany stops by but Jill, in fear of getting into further trouble, asks her to leave. Outside while getting back in her car, Tiffany is ambushed. Strange events begin to occur, such as the house alarm going off for no reason, until Jill receives menacing calls from the caller, indicating he can see her. Alarmed, she calls the police, who tell her they can trace the calls if she is able to keep him on the line for sixty seconds. While waiting for the phone to ring, Jill sees a shadow moving in the guesthouse. Believing it is the Mandrakis' son back from college, she goes to investigate but finds the guesthouse empty. Back at the main house, Jill searches for Rosa but finds only her belongings. The phone rings once again and the caller remains quiet on the other end as Jill manages to keep him on the line for a minute so the call can be traced. Jill then hears the shower running in the maid's room but, upon checking, the bathroom is empty. The police then tell her the calls are coming from inside the house. Horrified, Jill finds Tiffany dead on the bathroom floor and flees. Jill goes to the children who are already hiding in their playroom. She looks up and sees the intruder in the loft. They all escape into the greenhouse and hide. Jill discovers Rosa's dead body under the water. The stranger enters and searches the greenhouse. Jill manages to lock him inside but he breaks out and attacks her. During the altercation, Jill manages to stab the assailant‚Äôs hand into the hardwood floor with a fireplace poker, before rushing out of the house into the arms of a police officer. The assailant is arrested and Jill and the children survive. Days later while recuperating in the hospital, Jill awakens to a phone ringing. She gets out of bed and, while looking at her reflection in the mirror, the attacker appears behind her and grabs her. She begins to shriek hysterically, waking from her hallucination as the doctors and her dad desperately trying to stop her frantic panicking.

Screen Gems had plans to release both a remake of the original film and a sequel titled When a Stranger Returns. =Casting= Evan Rachel Wood was offered the role of Jill, but turned it down. Camilla Belle was then approached and almost turned the role down due to her personal dislike for horror films but West, the director, convinced her that he was going more for a psychological thriller and so she accepted. To prepare for the role, Belle had to do two months of weight-training and learning how to run. Belle was injured twice on the set, she struck a wooden bridge cutting and scarring her hand and also slammed her head against a glass window. =Filming= Principal photography began on January 1, 2005 and completed on February 28, 2005 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Bellarmine-Jefferson High School was used to portray the high school seen in the film while Signal Hill was used to portray the carnival shown in the film. Running Springs was used as the filming location for the road sequences. The house that was used in the film is located in Culver Studios - 9336 W. Washington Blvd., Culver City.

School bus stop laws are laws dictating what a motorist must do in the vicinity of a bus stop being used by a school bus or other bus, coach or minibus providing school transport. United States and Canada Jurisdictions in the United States (including overseas territories) and Canada have adopted various school bus stop laws that require drivers to stop and wait for a stopped school bus loading or unloading, so as to protect school children boarding or alighting. Generally, if a stopped school bus is displaying a flashing, alternating red lamp, a driver of a vehicle meeting or overtaking the stopped bus from either direction (front or back) must stop and wait until the bus moves again or the red light is off.TIP #10: SCHOOL BUS STOPS Police officers, school crossing guards, and even school bus drivers themselves may have the power to wave traffic on, even when a red light is flashing. On divided highways, most American and Canadian jurisdictions do not require vehicular drivers to stop when on the opposite side of the road from a stopped school bus. Those that do require vehicles to stop are: * West Virginia upon a non-controlled-access highway{¬ß17C-12-7} * Arkansas in case a divider has less than 20 feet (6 m) in width (narrow divider). * New York Statehttp://www.dmv.ny.gov/dmanual/chapter06-manual.htm, NYS Driver's Manual Chapter 6 - School Buses * American Samoa * Guam * British Columbia * Nova Scotia * Prince Edward Island * Northwest Territories * Nunavut American and Canadian jurisdictions have sought to deter illegal passing stopped school buses by increased enforcement and heavy penalties, including fines, application of demerit points against a driver's license or even license suspension. Nevertheless, violations are common. An officer must witness the violation, and even when citations issued, getting convictions is often difficult; sometimes traffic courts consider the evidence insufficient, or reduce the charge because the penalty for a first offense seems excessive. There are, however, exceptions. Missouri has Jessica's Law, which grants the right of a school bus driver to report the offense, in which case the driver is automatically cited. Cobb County, an urban county in Metro Atlanta, has added bus cameras, as a deterrent, which can detect and automatically report vehicles passing a bus. =Exceptions= Drivers in Washington state are not required to stop for a school bus on any highway (Under Washington law, any public road is defined as a highway) with three or more lanes when traveling in the opposite direction. This has been interpreted to mean that when approaching a bus from the opposite direction on a normal road with a turn lane, or a road with two lanes in each direction, etc., a driver is not required to stop their vehicle. This is an unusual law, but arguably leads to a higher safety level for children, as they are then required to be picked up or dropped on the same side of the road as the bus exit on anything greater than a two-lane road as provided by RCW 46.61.370. Ohio has a similar exception for roads with four or more lanes. Drivers in Idahohttp://www.legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title49/T49CH14SECT49-1422.htm and KentuckyKentucky Revised Statutes ¬ß 189.370(1). are not required to stop for a school bus on any highway with four or more lanes when traveling in the opposite direction. Drivers in California do not have to stop on any highway that is divided or is multi-lane (2 or more lanes of travel in each direction) when traveling in the opposite direction. In Pennsylvania, the only vehicle that may pass a stopped school bus with the red lights flashing is an emergency vehicle with its flashing lights and siren activated, but only after the emergency vehicle has come to a complete stop and proceeds with due caution for any students embarking or disembarking. =Enforcement = In New York State, an official estimate is that 50,000 vehicles pass stopped school buses illegally every day. However, as New York State requires traffic to stop for a school bus stopped on the opposing roadway of a divided highway, the estimate may include \\"New York violations\\" that would be legal in other states. The New York State Department of Transportation once recommended that the State Legislature exempt traffic from stopping for a school bus stopped on the opposing roadway of a divided highway, but this has not been done. On a national basis, school bus drivers in the United States have reported a decrease in passing violators in recent years with improved warning devices. Despite an increase in traffic and school bus ridership, annual fatalities and injuries to children struck by other vehicles has decreased as well. However, it is unclear whether having reported a decrease in passing violators is due to difficulty to report or better compliance by motorists. When and where enforcement against violators becomes too hard, some residential streets may prohibit entry of vehicles other than school buses at certain times to effectively eliminate passing stopped school buses illegally. Bus drivers are prohibited to turn around at intersections with students on the bus. If laws are broken, the bus driver may be charged with including but not limited to: child endangerment and disobeying laws. This section may not include all laws or bylaws. Other countries outside North America Traffic laws in other countries do not require vehicles to stop The speed limit is in Australia and in New ZealandNew Zealand speed limit passing a school bus when passing a stopped school bus. In New Zealand, the New Zealand Transport Agency decided that the speed limit passing a stopped school bus should not be raised based on probabilities of pedestrian deaths if hit at different speeds, nor has it supported requiring fully stopping and waiting for school buses loading and unloading children as in the United States and Canada. In Belgium and Germany, traffic is required to pass stopped school buses at very slow speeds that allow for quick stopping. While in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom, drivers are directed to drive carefully past stopped school buses.

Busselton is a major regional centre in the South West of Western Australia, about south of Perth and in the heart of the Margaret River wine region. History The airport was opened on 15 March 1997 and replaced Busselton Aerodrome, established in 1940, that was used extensively during World War II. A largely government-subsidised air service ran from Perth Airport to Busselton from 1997 to 2001 (including Margaret River Airport from 1999); it was operated by Skywest Airlines (now Virgin Australia Regional Airlines), Maroomba Airlines, and Skippers Aviation. In 2007, mining company Rio Tinto launched its first flight from the airport for fly-in fly-out workers at its mines. Skywest Airlines/Virgin Australia Regional Airlines ran a service from Perth to Albany Airport via Busselton from July 2011 until December 2014, before scaling it back to a Perth-Busselton route and cancelling it altogether in April 2015. Airport terminal building, 2006 Between June and December 2014, upgrades to the terminal were made. In June 2015, funding was allocated for further upgrades and redevelopment of the airport. As part of the funding agreement, Margaret River was officially added to the title of the airport in October 2015. In 2017, the airport commenced the $69.7 million redevelopment which included: * lengthening, widening and strengthening of the existing runway to facilitate Code E aircraft; * a new 4 bay Code E aircraft parking apron and connecting taxiways; * a new passenger terminal; * a new general aviation precinct; * upgrades to the existing Code C apron * new aeronautical ground lighting; * new parking facilities; * upgrades to the internal road network; and * infrastructure to support the development of freight and commercial opportunities. As part of the development, a new terminal building was proposed to be built in front of the new Code E Apron to help facilitate future interstate and international services. In early 2018, the Western Australian government placed the construction of the new terminal building on hold until a major commercial airline committed to interstate services that were shown to be viable. In June 2019, it was reported that Jetstar Airways were the most likely to begin a Busselton-Melbourne route within six to nine months. This route was confirmed in September 2019, with a heavily subsidised Jetstar service that was to begin in March 2020. As a result of the route confirmation, the Western Australian government announced it would spend an extra $3.2 million upgrading the airport's terminal. The route has been postponed indefinitely due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In April 2019, the airport was designated as an international alternate airport to Perth; previously the closest airports with this designation were Learmonth and Adelaide.  Airlines and destinations  Facilities Busselton Margaret River Airport has a single 2,460 metre long by 45 metre wide runway (03/21) and is rated at Code E with capability to handle aircraft the size and weight of the Airbus A330. Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) is available for both ends and low-intensity runway lights can be activated by radio (Pilot Controlled Lighting). Two illuminated windsocks are on site. Non-precision instrument approaches include GNSS (GPS) approaches to both runways, and a sole NDB (ADF) approach to runway 21.

The book was called the best \\"to have been written about the Vietnam War\\" by The New York Times Book Review. Novelist John le Carr√© called it \\"the best book I have ever read on men and war in our time.\\" Life and career Herr was born in Lexington, Kentucky, the son of a jeweler, and grew up in Syracuse, New York. His family was Jewish. After working with Esquire in the 1960s, from 1971 to 1975 he published nothing. Then, in 1977, he went on the road with rock and roller Ted Nugent and wrote about the experience in a 1978 cover story for Crawdaddy magazine. Also in 1977, he published Dispatches, upon which his reputation mostly rests. Herr was credited in the film for writing the narration for Francis Ford Coppola's 1997 film The Rainmaker. He had previously contributed to the narration for Coppola's 1979 film Apocalypse Now. He co-wrote the screenplay for the film Full Metal Jacket (1987) with director Stanley Kubrick and author Gustav Hasford. That film was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers and the screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. Herr collaborated with Richard Stanley in writing the original screenplay for the 1996 film The Island of Dr. Moreau based on the H.G. Wells novel of the same name. However, Stanley claims the subsequent rewrites cost Herr his writing credit, omitting most of the material created by the two writers. Herr wrote a pair of articles for Vanity Fair about Stanley Kubrick, which were later incorporated into the short book Kubrick (2000), a personal biography of the director. He declined to edit the script of Kubrick's last film Eyes Wide Shut (1999).

The Katoch Rajas had a stronghold here, with a fort and lavish temples. Another ancient name of the city is BhimagarEarly Aryans to Swaraj By S.R. Bakshi, page 40 and it was supposedly founded by Raja Bhim, younger brother of Kuru Emperor Yudhishthira of Indraprastha (now Delhi). The temple of Devi Vajreshwari was one of the oldest and wealthiest in northern India. It was destroyed, together with the fort and the town, by 1905 Kangra earthquake on 4 April 1905, when 1339 lives were lost in this place alone, and about 20,000 elsewhere. In 1855 the headquarters of the district were removed to the cantonment of Dharmsala, which was established in 1849.Kangra Town The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p. 397.Kangra District The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p. 380. .Dharamsala The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 11, p. 301. = Invasions on Nagarkot = It is said that Mahmud of Ghazni looted a fort in the region in 1009, but whether the fort of Kangra was taken or not is not yet historically verified. There were hundreds of well-defended forts that lay between Ghazni and Nagarkot fort, and so it highly unlikely that his looting expedition ever reached Kangra. Also, this claim is negated by historians who have cited various sources to say that the fort was impregnable and remained unconquered until the conquest by Emperor Jehangir in 1622. Official historical account of Kangra = The Katoch-Sikh battles and alliances against the Kingdom of Nepal = The fort was recaptured by the Katoch Kings after Jehangir's death. Multiple battles ensued between the Sikh king Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the Katoch King Sansar Chand Katoch. But, while the war between the Sikhs and Katochs was taking place, the gates of Kangra fort were left open. The Gurkha army entered the opened gates of Nagarkot fort in 1806. This forced an alliance between the battling Sikhs and Katochs, and both the armies re- captured the fort after a battle in 1809. Kangra stayed with the Katoch Kings until 1828 when Maharaja Ranjit Singh annexed it after Sansar Chand's death. Then after the Nepalese Gorkha Captured the Kangra until the British Came theirs. The fort and city were then captured by the British in 1846 and remained occupied until India's independence. The princely state of Kangra was merged in India in 1948 by the then titled Raja of Kangra-Lambagraon namely Raja Druv Dev Chand Katoch. It was part of the composite Punjab till November 1966 when it got transferred to Himachal Pradesh. Geography A map of the Punjab region. Kangra is located at .

In the case of judgement, discernment can be psychological, moral or aesthetic in nature. Within judgment, discernment involves going past the mere perception of something and making nuanced judgments about its properties or qualities. Considered as a virtue, a discerning individual is considered to possess wisdom, and be of good judgement; especially so with regard to subject matter often overlooked by others. Discernment can be scientific (that is discerning what is true about the real world), normative (discerning value including what ought to be) and formal (deductive reasoning). Christianity In Christianity, the word may have several meanings. Discernment can describe the process of determining God's desire in a situation or for one's life or identifying the true nature of a thing, such as discerning whether a thing is good, evil, or may even transcend the limiting notion of duality. In large part, it describes the interior search for an answer to the question of one's vocation, namely, determining whether or not God is calling one to the married life, single life, consecrated life, ordained ministry or any other calling. Discernment of Spirits is a term used in both Roman Catholic and Charismatic (Pentacostal) Christian theology to indicate judging various spiritual agents for their moral influence.  Process of Discernment  The process of individual discernment has required tasks in order for good discernment. These tasks include taking time in making the decision, using both the head and heart, and assessing important values. Time is necessary to make a good choice, decisions made in a hurry are often not the best decisions. When time is available to assess the situation it improves the discernment process. When time allots the tentative decision can be revisited days later to make sure that the individual is satisfied with their choice after the discernment process. Making decisions with the head means to first reflect on the situation and emphasize the rational aspect of the decision making process. In order to make a decision that is ours it also requires the heart in which the individual makes based on feelings as well as rationality. Values in the discernment process are weighing options that decide what is most important to the individual. Every individuals value system is different which effects each individual discernment process. Combining values, using both the head and heart and taking sufficient time when making decision are the main steps for a successful discernment process. Group discernment is a separate branch of discernment. In group discernment each individual must first undergo their own discernment process. The individual must keep in mind what is best for the group as a whole as well as the individual when making a decision. The same principles of values, using the head and heart, as well as giving the decision making process ample time all still apply in group discernment. Group discernment is different because it requires multiple people to have a unanimous decision in order to move forward. Group discernment requires discussion and persuasion between individuals to arrive at a decision.  Christian Spiritual Discernment  Christian spiritual discernment can be separated from other types of discernment because every decision is to be made in accordance with God's will. The fundamental definition for Christian discernment is a decision making process in which an individual makes a discovery that can lead to future action. In the process of Christian spiritual discernment God guides the individual to help them arrive at the best decision. The way to arrive at the best decision in Christian spiritual discernment is to seek out internal external signs of God's action and then apply them to the decision at hand. Christian Discernment also has an emphasis on Jesus, and making decisions that align with those of Jesus within the New Testament. The focus on God and Jesus when making decisions is what separates Christian discernment from secular discernment. Ignatius of Loyola is often regarded as the master of the discernment of spirits. Ignatian discernment comes from Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) when he created his own unique way of Catholic discernment. Ignatian discernment uses a series of Spiritual Exercises for discerning life choices and focuses on noticing God in all aspects of life. The Spiritual Exercises are designed to help people who are facing a major life decision. There are seven steps of discernment to be followed that include identifying the issue, taking time to pray about the choice, making a wholehearted decision, discussing the choice with a mentor and then finally trusting the decision made.

The speech produced is difficult to interrupt. Such speech may be too fast, erratic, irrelevant, or too tangential for the listener to understand. It is an example of cluttered speech, and is often associated with certain mental disorders, particularly mania and schizophrenia. It can be unrelenting, loud, and without pauses.  Causes  The pace of the speech indicates an underlying thought disorder known as \\"flight of ideas\\" wherein the flow of ideas and information through one's mind is so fast that it is difficult to follow their train of thought. This is also tied to an inability to focus on one topic or task. People with schizophrenia, as well as anyone experiencing extreme anxiety, may also exhibit pressure of speech. Pressure of speech usually refers to the improperly verbalized speech which is a feature of hypomanic and manic illness.Pressure of Speech - General Practice Notebook Pressure of speech has commonly been observed in people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. = Stimulants = Psychostimulants such as cocaine or amphetamines may cause speech resembling pressured speech in individuals with pre-existing psychopathology and produce hypomanic or manic symptoms in general, owing both to the substance's own qualities and the underlying nature of an individual's psyche. In many psychotic disorders, use of certain drugs amplifies certain expressions of symptoms, and stimulant- induced pressured speech is among them.  Related conditions  * Cluttering is a speech disorder that is related to pressure of speech in that the speech of a clutterer sounds improperly verbalized. However, cluttering is a distinct language disorder. Even though cluttering sounds almost identical to pressure of speech, it differs in that pressure of speech is rooted in anxiety, where cluttering is not. * Pressure of speech is an instance of tachylalia, or rapid speech. Pressure of speech is also variously related to agitolalia, agitophasia, tachyphasia, and verbomania. * Circumstantial speech is a communication disorder in which the focus of a conversation drifts, but often comes back to the point.Problem-Based Psychiatry by Ben Green 2009 page 15 In circumstantiality, unnecessary details and irrelevant remarks cause a delay in getting to the point.  Stutter formation  Pressured speech may also lead to the development of a stutter. The person's need or pressure to speak causes him or her to involuntarily stutter.

In 1991, the club merged with neighbouring Woodville Football Club to form the Woodville-West Torrens Eagles. Based in the western suburbs of Adelaide, the club derived its name from its location around the western reaches of the River Torrens. Club history A precursor club was the West Torrens Football Club that was founded in 1878 and dissolved in 1887. This club was unrelated to the Eagles. The modern club was formed in 1897 to compete in the SANFL. In its 93-year history, West Torrens won only four premierships; conversely, however, they only slumped to the wooden spoon on five occasions, evidence that they were generally quite competitive.. Despite their relative lack of team success, winning only four SANFL Premierships and one Night Premiership in their history (1924, 1933, 1945, 1953 and 1983 (night)), West Torrens boasted some of the best individual players ever to play Australian rules football. Players such as 1946 and 1947 Magarey Medallist, 1953 All-Australian and 1953 premiership captain Bob Hank, triple Magarey Medal winner (1955, 1958 & 1963), 1956 All-Australian and '53 premiership player Lindsay Head and former Australian Test cricketer Neil Hawke were all star players for the club. The club reached the finals for the last time in 1980 and by 1982 there were calls for West Torrens to merge with another club. In 1990, with the imminent entry of the South Australian-based Adelaide Crows into the national Australian Football League (AFL), it was decided that West Torrens and Woodville would amalgamate. In an apt moment, Woodville and West Torrens were drawn to play each other in their respective final games. The two sides merged after the completion of the 1990 season and have since participated in the SANFL as the Woodville-West Torrens Eagles.

The political society is considered instrumental on the beginning of the Indonesian National Awakening. History Budi Utomo was founded on 20 May 1908, and was the first native political society in the Dutch East Indies. The founder of Budi Utomo was a pensioned government doctor who felt that native intellectuals should improve education and culture among the public.Vickers, Adrian. 2005. A History of Modern Indonesia, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 73 The society held its first congress in May 1908.cf. Vandenbosch (1931). The congress was a gathering of students in Batavia. The first leader was Dr. Wahidin Soedirohoesodo, but by the organization's first major gathering in Yogyakarta in October 1908, he stepped aside for younger organizers. The Dutch were tolerant of the rise and development of Indonesian nationalism. Budi Utomo did not have mass appeal and they regarded the nationalist activities in the first decade of the 20th century as a natural outcome of the Ethical Policy, which emphasised the importance of looking after the welfare of the people. The membership was an upper class elite of natives, government officials and intellectuals, confined very largely in Java and the Javanese. The furtherance of popular education became the main activity. Few branches expanded the activity into native commerce and industry. Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo, who would later found the more radical Indische Party, expanded the scope of the society to include more working classes, and also the rest of the Ind√Øes outside of Java.Ind√Øes was the popular term coined by the Dutch East Indies government to indicate the inhabitants of the Netherlands East Ind√Øes. The organization enjoyed a rapid growth; in 1910 the society had 10,000 members enrolled in 40 branches. At the same time, it received official recognition from the colonial government. Budi Utomo's primary aim was first not political. However, it gradually shifted toward political aims with representatives in the conservative Volksraad (the People's Council) and in the provincial councils in Java. Budi Utomo officially dissolved in 1935, but it has marked the first nationalist movement in the early twentieth century. After dissolution, some of the members joined the largest political party of the time, the moderate Greater Indonesian Party (Parindra). In keeping with the outlook of Budi Utomo, former members‚Äîwhether in the Volksraad or Parindra‚Äîinsisted on the Indonesian language for all public statements.Mrazek, Rudolf. 2002. Engineers of Happy Land: Technology and Nationalism in a Colony, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 33 The use of Budi Utomo to mark the inception of modern nationalism in Indonesia is not without controversy. Although many scholars agree that Budi Utomo was likely the first modern indigenous political organization,cf. Mrazek, p. 89 others question its value as an index of Indonesian nationality. For example, in his novels, Pramoedya Ananta Toer pointed to the exclusively aristocratic and male composition of Budi Utomo.Heryanto, Ariel. 2008. \\"Questioning the relevance of national awakening today,\\" The Jakarta Post, May 21, 2008. Archived at Ariel HeryantoConvenor, Indonesia Studies, University of Melbourne questions the nationalism of Budi Utomo, given that its existence was permitted by the Dutch regime: \\"Because of [Budi Utomo's] remarkably conservative character, the Dutch colonial administration tolerated [it].\\" Heryanto points to a \\"more populist and egalitarian\\" Muslim association (Sarekat Dagang Islamiyah), born a few years prior, as a more genuinely nationalist organization: one which was banned by the Dutch. In enshrining Budi Utomo as the first nationalist organization, the current government reiterates the colonial version of history. Legacy The birth of Budi Utomo on 20 May 1908, has been officially commemorated as the Day of National Awakening in Indonesia since 1948. The Museum of National Awakening in Jakarta was dedicated to the Indonesian National Awakening, particularly because the building was a former STOVIA institution which is considered related with the birth of Budi Utomo. The building was initially made into four museums: Budi Utomo Museum, Museum of Women, Museum of Pers, and Museum of Health and Medicine. On 7 February 1984, the four museums were converged into the Museum of National Awakening. Notes References * Kahin, George M. 1952. Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia.

He advised his daughter on taking up songwriting from an early age. In an interview with the Music Producers Forum he recalls telling a young Colbie, \\"If you're really going to be a singer, then you have two choices, you're going to have to write your own songs, or you're going to have to buy somebody else's.\\" In January 2016, Caillat met with media entrepreneur Frank Pollifrone, who worked for Jefferson Starship producer Peter Wolf and co- founded PalmStar Media Capital, in Los Angeles. The two shared their passion for the history of the Record Plant studio in Sausalito, California, where Rumours had been recorded, and necessity for its restoration. After developing what was thought to be a more sustainable business model for the music industry, Pollifrone brought in marketing corporate strategist Kevin Bartram and incorporated their endeavor under the name Marin Music Project at the Record Plant in January 2017.

The Hard Road, Charitas Bischoff, Martin Hopkinson & Co., London, 1931, p.234 Career Amalie Dietrich was born in Siebenlehn, Saxony, German Confederation. In 1846, she married Wilhelm August Salomo Dietrich, a doctor. With no formal training she learnt all she could from him about collecting and they planned careers working as naturalists. Between 1845 and 1862 they made a precarious living collecting Alpine specimens to sell to chemists for medicines and to museums for their natural history collections.Amalie Dietrich 1821-1891, Studies in International Cultural relations, Number 29, Instiut fur Auslandsbeziehungen, Suttgart, SBUndersrepublik, Dueutschland, 1988, p.13 Some of the delicate alpine flowers she collected in this period can be seen on display in the Natural History Museum in Freiburg.Amalie Dietrich 1821-1891, Studies in International Cultural relations, Number 29, Instiut fur Auslandsbeziehungen, Suttgart, SBUndersrepublik, Dueutschland, 1988, p.13 It appears Wilhelm began spending most of his time mounting the specimens and the collecting fell to Amalie. This meant long, lonely, periods away from home which were made even worse after her only child, Charitas, was born in 1848. Her husband refused to look after his daughter, who she was boarded out to strangers, and, in 1859, left to fend for herself. Finally in 1861 her husband was discovered having an affair and she broke with him completely.The White Falcon, Pacific Books, 1963, p.52 She collected the type specimens of many species, and in a number of cases the author of the description honoured her in the species epithet (dietrichiae, dietrichiana, amaliae, etc.).

Overcoming her tragic childhood, she released her debut single Asueno tobira (Door to Tomorrow) as the duo I Wish in 2003. She is well known for her numerous street performances. She is also known for her devotion to help children under circumstances similar to hers in Japan and all over the world.  Early life  Kawashima was born and raised in Fukuoka, Japan. After her birth, her mother's health deteriorated and she died when Kawashima was only 3 years old. Because her father had been missing before she was born, she was taken to an orphanage and eventually adopted by the Kawashima family, owners of a construction company. Her foster father died when she was 10. After graduating from middle school, she moved to Tokyo. Her foster mother died when she was 16. She started playing the piano at the age of 3 and eventually began to think about a career as a singer.  Career  Kawashima started her career as an enka singer. At around the age of 10, she performed on stage at the Carnegie Hall in New York. In 1999, she released her debut single, Juu-roku Koi Gokoro / Anata ni Kataomoi. However, the enka project was crippled by poor sales and was abandoned entirely within a few months. After this initial failure, she began to sing her own songs on the busy street corners in Shibuya, Tokyo with a microphone and a radio cassette player. To become famous, she set herself the goal of performing 1,000 times on the street. Nobody paid attention to her songs at first, but the crowd gradually grew as she kept performing on streets and she met people who gave her support, culminating her major debut and the 2003 hit single \\"Asueno tobira\\" (Door to Tomorrow), which sold more than 900,000 copies. She sang the song as the vocalist of the duo I Wish. She has been performing solo since the duo broke up in 2005. Her second solo single, \\"12-ko no Kisetsu\\" (12 Seasons) ranked 10th on the Billboard Hits of the world, Japan. Even after her major debut, she kept performing on streets and, in 2005, she accomplished 1,000 street performances, which, according to Kawashima, became the foundation of her music. In 2009, she performed at Japan Day at Central Park, New York.  Personal life  Kawashima has devoted her time and money to a project to build schools in developing countries. 3 schools have been finished so far and her goal is to build 100 schools. Every year since her mother's death, she has held a memorial concert on August 20. On the night of March 11, 2011, 20 elementary school students who were able to flee the devastating tsunami after Tohoku earthquake comforted each other by singing the song Tabidachi no hi ni (On the day of departure) together at a local Shinto shrine where they spent the night. The students had been practicing the song for their graduation ceremony, which was only a week away. Having heard the story, Kawashima visited the students in a shelter on April 6 and sang the same song together. On August 21, she visited the students one more time to attend their belated graduation ceremony and sang the song together. The song ends with the words, \\"Let us bloom from this bud.\\"  Discography  Kawashima's songs have been featured in various anime and video games. is the theme song of Shining Force Neo; \\"Compass\\" is the theme song of the eighth One Piece movie Episode of Alabasta: The Desert Princess and the Pirates, and \\"Kimi no Koe\\" is the ending theme song of The Place Promised in Our Early Days.

Shortly after meeting the two began playing all over Bowling Green, Kentucky, from dorm rooms to coffee houses. Eventually though, the two began playing at a Bowling Green restaurant, Happy Inn, and began drawing substantial crowds. Formation Then the two got Brian Meurer, bassist, and together they recorded their first album, \\"Forgot To Breathe\\" (1998). Dave Kidd, drummer, joined the next year and the band began putting their music on MP3.com, which led to increased popularity and sales.

Humbaja Atishaya Jain Teerth Kshetra is famous for being home to an ancient temple of Goddess Padmavati, and to the Humbaj Matha (seminary/monastery), an important institution of the Jain community. This temple is considered to be very holy and is known for its cultural and historical heritage. Other notable highlights of the place are a lake that reputedly never dries up and a tree that likewise always remains green. Jain devotees of this holy place are everywhere throughout India and also in foreign countries. Thousands of devotees come to the Hombaja every year for fulfillment of their desires. History Humcha was an important Jain pilgrim centre from 8th - 16th century. Santara rulers made it their capital. =Santara dynasty= The History of this region is also associated with Santara or Bhairarasa dynasty. Santara or Bhairarasa is the name of a medieval ruling dynasty of Karnataka, India. Jinadatta Raya, a Jain prince from Mathura in Northern India was the supposed founder of the dynasty. He is said to have migrated to the town of Humcha with an idol of the Jain deity Padmavati, laying the foundation of the kingdom in Humcha. The area covered by their kingdom included territories in the Malenadu region as well as the coastal districts of Karnataka. The dynasty founded by Jinadatta appears to have split into two branches by the 12 century C.E. One branch being stationed in Hosagunda of Shimoga district and Kalasa in the Western ghats, chikkamagalur district. Gradually these branches (or only the Kalasa branch) shifted their capitals to Keravashe (14 km north-east of Karkala) and Karkala both in the old South Canara district. Hence the territory they ruled was also known as the Kalasa-Karkala kingdom. Edgar Thurston mentions that the Bhairarasas or Santaras were among the powerful BuntThurston, Edgar; K. Rangachari (1909).

The Santaras were Jains and had matrimonial relations with the Saivite Alupa royal family of the canara region. The Santaras built a number of Jain monuments and were responsible for the spread of Jainism in the Tulu Nadu and Malenadu region of Karnataka. During this period the Santara ruler Veera Pandya Bhairarasa erected the monolith of Bahubali in Karkala. The Santaras became the feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire after its rise. The dynasty passed into oblivion after invasions by the Nayakas of Keladi and later by Hyder Ali The Jain Matha (Mutt) at Hombuja Humcha Padmavati temple The Bhattaraka seat at Humcha, famous for the Humcha Padmavati temple, was founded in the 8th century AD, during the reign of Jinadatta Raya, founder of the ruling dynasty of Santara.Jinmanjari: Contemporary Jaina Reflections, Volumes 17-22, Bramhi Society, 1998, p. 43 We can find first references of Santharas in the inscriptions installed by the Chalukyan king Vinayaditya. Santhara kingdom was established by Jinadattaraya. He was a staunch follower of Jainism and had donated a village by name Kumbhasikapura for carrying out day to day abisheka of Jain idols.SANTARAS OF HUMCHA - A CULTURAL STUDY, Kuvempu University PhD Thesis, Sarvamangala G., JULY 2008JAINISM IN SOUTHERN KARNATAKA Upto 1565 AD By Dr. Shakuntala Prakash Chavan, 2005, CHAPTER - IV HUMCHA: THE CAPITAL OF SANTARA DYNASTY AND A SEAT OF GODDESS -PADMAVATI Vikrama Santha had built a separate residence to his guru Mouni Siddantha Bhattaraka of kunda Kundanvaya tradition in 897 A.D. The Gudda Basadi was built by him and he had donated the idol of Lord Bahubali to be installed at the temple. Bhujabali Santha had built a Jain temple at Hombuja and had named it after him. Further, he had donated the village Harivara for the well being of his guru Kanakanandi deva. Nanni Santha, brother of Bhujabali Santha was a staunch follower of Jainism & was very much involved in pooja and other rituals. An inscription of A.D. 1103 states that Malla Santha in memory of his wife Veera Abbarasi and in honour to his Guru Vadigaratta Ajithasena Pandita Deva had laid the foundation stone of a temple at Hombuja. This temple was built in front of the present Pancha Basadi. Bhujbalaganga Permadi (A.D. 1115) one of the rulers of Hombuja had renovated a temple and had donated several villages to it. This temple was built by Dadiga and Madhava the founders of Ganga kingdom. Nanniyaganga, son of Bhujabalaganga renovated the same temple in A.D. 1122 and donated some lands to the temple. Nanniyaganga built 25 Jain temples for popularising the religion. Veerasantha (A.D. 1172) who succeeded Nanniyaganga was called as \\"Jinadevana Charana Kamalgala Bhrama\\" as a mark of respect to his contribution to Jainism. In 1048 AD, the Mahamandaleshwara Chandarayarus made a donation to a Bhattaraka of Balagara-gana at Balligame near Banavasi in present-day Karnataka.Religious Institutions and Cults in the Deccan, C. A.D. 600-A.D. 1000, By Ramendra Nath Nandi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1973, p. 151 Thus, the Bhattaraka seat at Humcha may be one of the oldest of its kind. The most widespread Bhattaraka order has historically been the MulaSangh-NandiSangh-BalatkaraGana-SaraswatiGachchha (MNBS) order. It has seats at Surat, Idar, Ajmer, Jaipur, Chittor, Nagaur, Delhi, Gwalior, Chanderi, Sironj and many other places. There are perhaps hundreds of thousands of Tirthankara idols, spread across the country from Surat to Decca (in Bangladesh), bearing inscriptions mentioning this order. Most of these idols were installed by the Bhattarakas of this order in the past seven or eight centuries. Many of these Bhattarakas were great scholars and prolific authors. The ancient institution at Humcha is the original home of the MNBS order. It is headed by Sri Devendrakeerthi Bhattarakha Swamiji. He is the only existing Bhattaraka of the MNBS order, since all the Bhattaraka seats in north India became extinct in the early part of the 20th century. Several Jain organizations are run by the institute at Humcha. This temple also features a 21 feet idol of Lord Parshvanatha. The Panchakuta Basadi was built in 1077 by Chattaladevi. An annual Rathayatra Mahotsava of Lord Parshwanatha and Goddess Padmavati is held with other programmes at Humcha during the months of March/April under the guidance of Devendrakeerthi Bhattarakha Swamiji.

It consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (adopted in 1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, 1966) with its two Optional Protocols and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR, 1966). The two covenants entered into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them. In the beginning, different views were expressed about the form the bill of rights should take. In 1948, General Assembly planned the bill to include UDHR, one Covenant and measures of implementation. The Drafting Committee decided to prepare two documents: one in the form of a declaration, which would set forth general principles or standards of human rights; the other in the form of a convention, which would define specific rights and their limitations. Accordingly, the Committee transmitted to the Commission on Human Rights draft articles of an international declaration and an international convention on human rights. At its second session, in December 1947, the Commission decided to apply the term \\"International Bill of Human Rights\\" to the series of documents in preparation and established three working groups: one on the declaration, one on the convention (which it renamed \\"covenant\\") and one on implementation. The Commission revised the draft declaration at its third session, in May/June 1948, taking into consideration comments received from Governments. It did not have time, however, to consider the covenant or the question of implementation. The declaration was therefore submitted through the United Nations Economic and Social Council to the General Assembly, meeting in Paris. Later the draft covenant was divided in two (decided by the General Assembly in 1952), differing with both catalogue of rights and degree of obligations ‚Äì for example, the ICESCR refers to the \\"progressive realisation\\" of the rights it contains.

Biography Ladanyi began his career by working on Hasten Down the Wind under the tutelage of engineer/producer Val Garay. Around 1980 Ladanyi expanded from just engineering into production as well. He recounted, \\"Part of the way I came up into coproducing was by elevating engineering to a point where it has an awful lot to do with the production of the record. That comes from a lot of dialogue with an artist and really taking some responsibility for the way a record comes out, as opposed to just sitting there and doing what an artist or producer needs done.\\" Ladanyi co-produced the Behind the Mask album with Fleetwood Mac. He also co-produced, engineered, and mixed Don Henley's first two solo albums I Can't Stand Still and Building the Perfect Beast. He won a Grammy Award in 1983 in the Best Engineered Recording - Non-Classical category for Toto IV by Toto. He married Laura Grayson-Ladanyi in 1984.

He traveled and worked internationally throughout the world till 1998, and managed artists under the name of Ladanyi Entertainment. In 2007, he partnered with Starr Andreeff and Mike Renault to form Maple Jam Music Group. His most recent work involved producing Ligion's new album, External Affairs. He was also the main producer on Anna Vissi's album, Apagorevmeno, which was released on December 9, 2008, in Greece and Cyprus.

The original group was based in Manila, Philippines, and had James Coronel, Geneva Cruz, Jeffrey Hidalgo, and Tony Lambino as its original members while Jayson Angangan, Chedi Vergara, and Zhar Santos joined James Coronel for the second lineup after Geneva Cruz, Jeffrey Hidalgo & Tony Lambino left the group. Eventually, James Coronel left to pursue a solo career and Anna Fegi replaced Shar Santos during the 1994 tour in Japan. First Batch The first batch was discovered and developed by songwriter/arranger/musical director Ryan Cayabyab. The concept for their debut album cover came from the idea that they had to be dressed in ragged clothes to depict the then-dire situation of the scavengers living in the garbage dump in Manila. Hence, that's where the group had derived their name from. In 1989, the group released its first self-titled pop album that consisted of songs revolving around social, environmental, and patriotic themes. The group's first hit, Kailan (When), was number one on national airwaves for eight straight weeks and the album hit gold, platinum, and double-platinum status within months of its release. In late 1990, the group went on the \\"Better World\\" tour, performing at the United Nations World Summit for Children in New York and representing the Philippines at the 5th ASEAN Song Festival in Surabaya, Indonesia. Second Batch Having to choose between formal schooling and a two-year, two-album contract for release in Europe and the U.S., Tony Lambino and Jeffrey Hidalgo left the group, while Geneva Cruz pursued a solo career & released her first solo album \\"I like you\\". The popularity of the group already reached its peak at the time of the departure of the group's 3 members, however, Ryan Cayabyab held auditions to find new members to fill in the void of the 3 founding members who left the group. Ryan Cayabyab then reformed the group with remaining original member James Coronel and three new members Shar Santos, Chedi Vergara, and Jayson Angangan. This second batch also had successful hits, such as Da Coconut Nut (about the benefits of the coconut tree), Paraiso (literally paradise; about a degrading environment filled with garbage and smog), and their own version of Kailan (boy version). They also won awards for both Paraiso, \\"Kahit Habang Buhay\\" and Tayo Na. The media was very critical of the new members who joined James Coronel, however in 1992 at the Tokyo Music Festival the new lineup proved their worth as they won the grand prize in the contest. They also joined the Golden Kite Festival & won the 1st Place trophy, their album also sold more copies than the original lineup's release & had more tours in Asia and Europe. Third Batch In around 1993 they released the 3rd & international album \\"Know You Will\\", after the promotion of the 3rd album James Coronel would leave the group. The remnants of the latest batch released the 4th album \\"Death Penalty\\" & disbanded a year later. In 1998 BMG Records (now Sony Music Philippines) released the fifth and final album of the Smokey Mountain \\"Smokiest Hits\\" with 12 tracks. Past band members Geneva Cruz moved on to showbiz full-time. Tony Lambino cut a solo album and wrote songs recorded by fellow artists, did musical theatre with the Cultural Center of the Philippines, among others, and anchored an early morning news program on ABS-CBN. He finished his undergraduate studies at the Ateneo De Manila University, cum laude, and completed his master's degree at Harvard University as a Fulbright Scholar. He is currently a Ph.D. candidate at University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. Tony Lambino also worked at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. and is now head of communication at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). He then became an Assistant Secretary of the Philippine Department of Finance. Jeffrey Hidalgo completed his Chemical Engineering degree at the University of the Philippines and placed 11th when he took the board exam. In 2009, he studied film making at the New York Film Academy in Abu Dhabi. He has written songs in recent years and even competed in the Metropop Song Festival. He currently runs his own company which produces cleaning products. James Coronel owns call centers in USA, Philippines, India, and Sri Lanka. Shar Santos auditioned in the fourth edition of the reality TV show American Idol under the name Sharon Galvez, but was shut out of the semi-finals and now she is Sharon Kaylor. Chedi Vergara also released her self-titled album \\"Chedi\\" with some success and she joined in Teatro and she also has a band but now she lives in Brisbane, Australia. Jayson Angangan returned to his own native land in Ilagan, Isabela. Anna Fegi joined the group in 1994 for the final tour in Japan as she replaced Shar Santos. Anna has gone on to release 2 solo albums under the Sony BMG label, performed on the hit show ASAP, toured with cruise line Royal Caribbean International, and performed in several musicals for Atlantis Productions in both Manila and Singapore. She also owns and operates a successful music school, Brown Academy of Music, in Cebu. Reunited for Charity in 2011 and 2020 In March 2011, all Smokey Mountain members re-united for the first time in 15 years to record a new song for Japan earthquake relief entitled I FEEL WHAT YOU FEEL.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0FuFBONMlk The group has strong ties to Japan as some members lived in Tokyo during the peak of their popularity in the early 1990s. Due to the members now being spread out all over the globe, the song was recorded separately and then edited together in a studio. In May 2020, the members again reunited virtually for a Bayanihan Musikahan special. They performed a \\"Paraiso/Better World medley as well as \\"Da Coconut Nut.\\" The performance was shown on ABS-CBN as well as streamed as a fundraising effort for the coronavirus pandemic. There was a rerun on May 9 on the Facebook page of Bayanihan Musikahan. Six of the eight members were interviewed by Iza Calzado during the May 9 special. The group held another virtual reunion on June 30 for the benefit of World Wildlife Fund. Chronology of Lineup Original lineup: *James Coronel *Geneva Cruz *Tony Lambino *Jeffrey Hidalgo 2nd.

It is equivalent to district courts in the other states. The County Court is the principal trial court in the state, having a broad criminal and civil jurisdiction. The court hears indictable offences (with the exception of murder, manslaughter, and treason), and has unlimited civil jurisdiction, though it generally only hears cases where the statement of claim exceeds the Magistrates' Court limit of $100,000. The court also possesses appellate jurisdiction for cases from the Magistrates' Court, while decisions of the County Court may be appealed to the Supreme Court. With approximately 70 sitting judges, the court hears up to 12,000 cases annually. Since 8 September 2015, the Chief Judge of the County Court has been His Honour Chief Judge Peter Kidd. History The County Court was first established in Victoria in 1852 by the County Courts Act 1852. A County Court operated in the County of Bourke and some regional towns. The County Courts were modelled on the British county courts, which were established in 1846. Originally, the Court's principal purpose was to handle small civil claims. Since that time, the Court's jurisdiction has expanded. Jurisdiction In the hierarchy of Victorian courts, the County Court of Victoria sits above the Magistrates‚Äô Court of Victoria and below the Supreme Court of Victoria. Judges of the County Court hear matters across three divisions ‚Äì Criminal, Commercial and Common Law. County Court judges also sit as the heads of jurisdiction at the Magistrates‚Äô Court of Victoria, Coroners Court of Victoria and the Children‚Äôs Court of Victoria and sit at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal as Vice-Presidents. =Criminal Division= The County Court hears all indictable criminal matters except treason, murder and certain other homicide offences. The Court deals with a broad range of offences under Victorian and Commonwealth legislation including serious theft, armed robbery, drug trafficking, sexual offences, fraud and dishonesty offences, culpable driving, serious assault and income and sales tax offences. All trials are heard before a judge and a jury of 12 members of the community. = Criminal appeals = The County Court hears criminal appeals from the Magistrates‚Äô Court. These appeals are determined by judge alone. An appeal decision is generally final, except when a sentence of imprisonment is imposed and the Magistrates‚Äô Court did not originally impose a sentence of imprisonment. In such a case, the appellant may then appeal to the Court of Appeal, so long as leave is granted. The County Court also hears appeals from the Criminal and Family Divisions of the Children‚Äôs Court. =Commercial and Common Law Divisions= The Court‚Äôs Commercial and Common Law Divisions (collectively known as the Court‚Äôs civil jurisdiction), have unlimited jurisdiction with no monetary cap on damages. Both divisions feature a number of ‚Äòlists‚Äô ‚Äì specialist categories of cases that are administered by a judge. The Commercial Division deals with matters that include debt recovery, contract, trust and property. It has four lists: * General List * Expedited List * Banking and Finance List * Building Cases List The Common Law Division largely deals with damages and compensation cases. It consists of eight lists: * Applications List * Confiscation List * Defamation List * Family Property List * General List * Medical List * Serious Injury Applications List * WorkCover List All civil matters are heard by a single judge or, at a party‚Äôs request, by a judge and jury. = Adoption and Substitute Parentage = In Victoria, an adoption order legally transfers parental rights and responsibilities, guardianship and custody to the adoptive parents. The County Court hears approximately 50-80 adoption and parentage matters annually.  Circuits  In addition to proceedings in Melbourne, County Court judges hear criminal and civil cases at 12 locations throughout Victoria: Bairnsdale, Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Horsham, Mildura, Latrobe Valley (Morwell), Sale, Shepparton, Wangaratta, Warrnambool and Wodonga.  Koori Court  The County Koori Court was established under the County Court Amendment (Koori Court) Act 2008. The Act was assented to on 23 September 2008 and established the Koori Court as a Division of the County Court. The Latrobe Valley County Koori Court commenced on 19 November 2008, with the first sitting taking place on 2 February 2009. The objective of the County Koori Court is to ensure greater participation of the Aboriginal community in the sentencing process through the role played in that process by the Aboriginal Elders and Respected Persons and others such as the Koori Court Officer. It is only the judge who determines the sentence that is imposed. The County Koori Court follows the Koori Court model introduced at the Magistrates‚Äô Court of Victoria and the Children‚Äôs Court of Victoria. The County Koori Court currently sits at Latrobe Valley (Morwell), Melbourne, Mildura and Shepparton. The County Koori Court can only be attended by Koori offenders who plead guilty to particular offences. Aboriginal Elders or Respected Persons advise the judge on cultural issues relating to the accused and his or her offending behaviour. Elders and Respected Persons provide information on the background of the accused and possible reasons for offending behaviour. They may also explain relevant kinship connections, how particular crimes have affected the Indigenous community and provide advice on cultural practices, protocols and perspectives relevant to sentencing. The same sentencing law, however, applies in the County Koori Court as applies in the mainstream County Court. Chief Judge of the County Court of Victoria  The current County Court Chief Judge is His Honour Peter Kidd, who was appointed to the role on 8 September 2015. Chief Judge Kidd is a member of the Courts Council, and a Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria.

Heightened scrutiny is applied where a suspect or quasi- suspect classification is involved, or a fundamental right is implicated. In United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, the nature of the interest at issue determines the level of scrutiny applied by appellate courts. When courts engage in rational basis review, only the most egregious enactments, those not rationally related to a legitimate government interest, are overturned.\\"Rational Basis Test.\\" The Free Dictionary.

Overview Rational basis review tests whether the government's actions are \\"rationally related\\" to a \\"legitimate\\" government interest.United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938). The Supreme Court has never set forth standards for determining what constitutes a legitimate government interest.See Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825, 834 (1987) Under rational basis review, it is \\"entirely irrelevant\\" what end the government is actually seeking and statutes can be based on \\"rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.\\"FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc. 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993) Rather, if the court can merely hypothesize a \\"legitimate\\" interest served by the challenged action, it will withstand rational basis review.Sullivan, Kathleen M. & Gunther Gerald. Constitutional Law. Foundation Press, New York, NY. 16th Ed. Chapter 9 (2007). Judges following the Supreme Court's instructions understand themselves to be \\"obligated to seek out other conceivable reasons for validating\\" challenged laws if the government is unable to justify its own policies.Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 253 F.3d 137, 146 (1st Cir.2001) History The concept of rational basis review can be traced to an influential 1893 article, \\"The Origin and Scope of American Constitutional Law,\\" by Harvard law professor James Bradley Thayer. Thayer argued that statutes should be invalidated only if their unconstitutionality is \\"so clear that it is not open to rational question.\\" Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., a student of Thayer's, articulated a version of what would become rational basis review in his canonical dissent in Lochner v. New York, arguing that \\"the word 'liberty,' in the 14th Amendment, is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion, unless it can be said that a rational and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have been understood by the traditions of our people and our law.\\" However, the court's extensive application of economic substantive due process during the years following Lochner meant that Holmes' proposed doctrine of judicial deference to state interest was not immediately adopted.Indest, Miles O. \\"Walking Dead: The Fifth Circuit Resurrects Rational Basis Review.\\" Tulane Law Review 88.5 (2014): 993‚Äì1005. Web. 26 Aug. 2015. It was not until Nebbia v. New York that the Court began to formally apply rational basis review, when it stated that \\"a State is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose.\\" In United States v. Carolene Products Co. the Court in Footnote Four left open the possibility that laws that seem to be within \\"a specific prohibition of the Constitution,\\" which restrict the political process, or which burden \\"discrete and insular minorities\\" might receive more exacting review. Today, such laws receive strict scrutiny, whereas laws implicating unenumerated rights that the Supreme Court has not recognized as fundamental receive rational basis review. Applicability In modern constitutional law, the rational basis test is applied to constitutional challenges of both federal law and state law (via the Fourteenth Amendment). This test also applies to both legislative and executive action whether those actions be of a substantive or procedural nature. The rational basis test prohibits the government from imposing restrictions on liberty that are irrational or arbitrary, or drawing distinctions between persons in a manner that serves no constitutionally legitimate end.Killian, Johnny H., George A. Costello, & Kenneth R. Thomas, co-eds., The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002, by Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress (Senate Document No. 108-17, 108th Congress, 2d Session) (Washington [D.C.]: U.S. Gov't Printing Ofc. 2004) (short title: Constitution Annotated), pp. 1906‚Äì1910 (pp. 242‚Äì246 per Adobe Acrobat Reader) (Fourteenth Amendment , title page (p. [I] (p. 1 per Adobe Acrobat Reader)) , and Authorization (authorization to publish by joint resolution) (giving short title) (p. III) (p. 1 per Adobe Acrobat Reader) , all as accessed October 23, 2005). While a law \\"enacted for broad and ambitious purposes often can be explained by reference to legitimate public policies which justify the incidental disadvantages they impose on certain persons\\", it must nevertheless, at least, bear \\"a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose\\".Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 (1996). To understand the concept of rational basis review, it is easier to understand what it is not. Rational basis review is not a genuine effort to determine the legislature's actual reasons for enacting a statute, nor to inquire into whether a statute does in fact further a legitimate end of government. A court applying rational basis review will virtually always uphold a challenged law unless every conceivable justification for it is a grossly illogical non sequitur. In 2008, Justice John Paul Stevens reaffirmed the lenient nature of rational basis review in a concurring opinion: \\"[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, Thurgood Marshall, remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'\\"New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. 196, 209 (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring). See also * Due process * Equal Protection Clause * John Marshall * Marbury v. Madison * Plyler v. Doe * Romer v.

It lies four kilometres south-west of the city centre, close to Eden Park and Western Springs. The residential suburb lies between the suburbs of Grey Lynn, Kingsland, Sandringham, and Mount Albert, near the arterial North-Western Motorway and Western Railway line. The name comes from a farm estate called \\"Morningside\\" that was subdivided in 1865 for housing lots. The suburb is centred on the Morningside shops which are located on the New North Road, near the Morningside railway station. One of Morningside's largest buildings is the 1920s brick building which formerly housed the Mount Albert Borough Council until Mt Albert was amalgamated with Auckland City in the late 1980s. St Lukes Shopping Centre is close by. The local Secondary schools are Mount Albert Grammar School, Marist College and St Peter's College. Morningside was the setting of the animated TV show Bro'Town, and also the album title and birthplace of Fazerdaze. Demographics Morningside had a population of 3,981 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 156 people (4.1%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 375 people (10.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,320 households. There were 1,986 males and 1,995 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.0 males per female.

Ethnicities were 68.6% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 9.0% MƒÅori, 10.2% Pacific peoples, 21.9% Asian, and 3.8% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 37.9%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 53.2% had no religion, 27.8% were Christian, and 14.3% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 1,593 (45.7%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 204 (5.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $46,000.

Allan (born 1880) was a member of the City Council in Los Angeles, California from 1921 to 1927. Biography Born on September 12, 1880, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Allan was the son of Martin Smith Allan and Shara Neptune. He was educated in the public schools of Saint John until he was 18, when he moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and finished his schooling there. He did \\"electrical experimental work\\" in Boston and moved to California in 1903, where he joined the Electrical Workers Union and worked with the Woodill-Hulse Electric Company and then with the Auto Vehicle Company. He began working in insurance and finance in 1905, then became president of the Guarantee Finance & Securities Company and vice-president of Insurance Plan Mutual Building and Loan. He later formed Allan MacMaster Company, of which he was senior partner. Allan was married to Helen M. Urenn of Taylorville in 1907; they had two children, Robert M. Jr. and Lois. A Methodist and a Republican, Taylor was a member of the Jonathan, City, Breakfast, Casa Del Mar, Lakeside, El Caballero and San Pedro Golf clubs. His hobbies were golf and fishing. After leaving the City Council, Allan returned to his private business interests.Los Angeles Public Library reference file Public life =City Council= See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns Allan was elected to the City Council in 1921 when the city used an at-large voting system and was reelected in 1923 under the same system. After the adoption of a new city charter in 1925, in which district voting was established, he was chosen as the first councilman from the city's 2nd District, which at that time covered Hollywood south of Franklin Avenue or Hollywood Boulevard and north of Santa Monica Boulevard, and including the Los Feliz district.\\"First Map Showing City Council's Districts,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 16, 1925, page 1 Includes a map. \\"Here Are the Hundred and Twelve Aspirants for the City's Fifteen Councilmanic Seats,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 3, 1925, page 7 Includes a map.

Kripalani was a Gandhian socialist, environmentalist, mystic and independence activist. He grew close to Gandhi and at one point, he was one of Gandhi's most ardent disciples. He had served as the General Secretary of the INC for almost a decade. He had experience working in the field of education and was made the president to rebuild the INC. Disputes between the party and the Government over procedural matters affected his relationship with the colleagues in the Government. Kripalani was a familiar figure to generations of dissenters, from the Non- Cooperation Movements of the 1920s to the Emergency of the 1970s. Early life Jivatram (also spelled Jiwatram) Bhagwandas Kripalani was born in Hyderabad in Sindh in 1888. Following his education at Fergusson College in Pune, he worked as a schoolteacher before joining the freedom movement in the wake of Gandhi's return from South Africa. From 1912 to 1917 Kripalani worked as a lecturer of English and history at L.S. College (then known as Grier BB College), Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Kripalani was involved in the Non-Cooperation Movement of the early 1920s. He worked in Gandhi's ashrams in Gujarat and Maharashtra on tasks of social reform and education, and later left for Bihar and the United Provinces in northern India to teach and organise new ashrams. He courted arrested on numerous occasions during the Civil Disobedience movements and smaller occasions of organising protests and publishing seditious material against the British Raj. Congress leader Kripalani joined the All India Congress Committee and became its general secretary in 1928‚Äì29. Kripalani was prominently involved over a decade in top Congress party affairs, and in the organisation of the Salt Satyagraha and the Quit India Movement. Kripalani served in the interim government of India (1946‚Äì1947) and the Constituent Assembly of India. During this time he rejected the proposal of United Bengal from Abul Hashim and Sarat Bose and called for the division of Bengal and the Punjab. He had served as the General Secretary of the INC for almost a decade. He had experience working in the field of education and was made the president to rebuild the INC. Disputes between the party and the Government over procedural matters affected his relationship with the colleagues in the Government. As Congress President and the election of 1950 In spite of being ideologically at odds with both Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru ‚Äì he was elected Congress President for the crucial years around Indian independence in 1947. After Gandhi's assassination in January 1948, Nehru rejected his demand that the party's views should be sought in all decisions. Nehru, with the support of Patel, told Kripalani that while the party was entitled to lay down the broad principles and guidelines, it could not be granted a say in the government's day-to-day affairs. This precedent became central to the relationship between government and the ruling party in subsequent decades. Nehru, however, supported Kripalani in the election of the Congress President in 1950. Kripalani, supported by Nehru, was defeated by Patel's candidate Purushottam Das Tandon. Bruised by his defeat, and disillusioned by what he viewed as the abandonment of the Gandhian ideal of a countless village republics, Kripalani left the Congress and became one of the founders of the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party. This party subsequently merged with the Socialist Party of India to form the Praja Socialist Party. For a while it was even believed that Nehru, stung by the defeat, was considering abandoning the Congress as well; his several offers of resignation at the time were all, however, shouted down. A great many of the more progressive elements of the party left in the months following the election. Congress's subsequent bias to the right was only balanced when Nehru obtained the resignation of Tandon in the run-up to the general elections of 1951. 1961 Candidacy In October 1961, Kripalani contested the Lok Sabha seat of V. K. Krishna Menon, then serving as Minister of Defence, in a race that would come to attract extraordinary amounts of attention. The Sunday Standard observed of it that \\"no political campaign in India has ever been so bitter or so remarkable for the nuances it produced\\". Kripalani, who had previously endorsed Menon's foreign policy, devoted himself to attacking his vituperative opponent's personality, but ultimately lost the race, with Menon winning in a landslide. Socialist Party Kripalani remained in opposition for the rest of his life and was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952 (lost General Election in February 1952 from Faizabad, UP, as KMPP candidate, but won a bye-election as PSP candidate from Bhagalpur), 1957 (from Sitamarhi, Bihar as PSP candidate), 1963, and 1967 (by-poll in Guna in MP as Swatantra Party candidate). His wife since 1938, Sucheta Kripalani, briefly joined KMPP founded by him in 1951, but later returned to Congress, and went from strength to strength in the Congress Party, with several Central ministries; she was also the first female Chief Minister, in Uttar Pradesh. When Congress split in 1969, Sucheta Kripalani became part of Congress (Org), led by Nijalingappa and Morarji Desai. The Kripalanis were frequently at loggerheads in Parliament. One matter they agreed on was the undesirability of vast parts of the Hindu Marriage Act, particularly the controversial 'Restitution of Conjugal Rights' clause. By this clause, a partner who had survived an unsuccessful filing for divorce could move the courts to return to the status quo ante in terms of conjugal interaction. Kripalani, horrified, made one of his most memorable speeches, saying \\"this provision is physically undesirable, morally unwanted and aesthetically disgusting.\\" Kripalani was also concerned with the privilege of parliament over the press. During Nehru's premiership, the Lok Sabha called the Chief Editor of the weekly Blitz, the well-known Russi Karanjia to the bar and admonished him for \\"denigration and defamation of a member of parliament\\" for calling Kripalani, \\"Cripple-loony\\". This was despite Karanjia's closeness to and Kripalani's estrangement from, Nehru. Kripalani moved the first-ever No confidence motion on the floor of the Lok Sabha in August 1963, immediately after the disastrous India-China War. Later life Kripalani remained a critic of Nehru's policies and administration while working for social and environmental causes. While remaining active in electoral politics, Kripalani gradually became more of a spiritual leader of the socialists than anything else; in particular, he was generally considered to be, along with Vinoba Bhave, the leader of what remained of the Gandhian faction. He was active, along with Bhave, in preservation and conservation activities throughout the 1970s. In 1972-3, he agitated against the increasingly authoritarian rule of Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India. Kripalani and Jayaprakash Narayan felt that Gandhi's rule had become dictatorial and anti-democratic. Her conviction on charges of using government machinery for her election campaign galvanised her political opposition and public disenchantment against her policies. Along with Jayaprakash Narayan, Kripalani toured the country urging non-violent protest and civil disobedience. When the Emergency was declared as a result of the vocal dissent he helped stir up, the octogenarian Kripalani was among the first of the Opposition leaders to be arrested on the night of 26 June 1975. He lived long enough to survive the Emergency and see the first non-Congress government since Independence following the Janata Party victory in the 1977 polls. He and Jayaprakash Narayan, two seniors guiding lights, were requested to choose the parliamentary leader of the new party who would be the prime minister, and they chose Morarji Desai. Jayaprakash Narayan, in wheel-chair, administered a pledge at Raj Ghat to new members of parliament that they will honour the mandate and remain united. Acharya Kripalani died on 19 March 1982 at the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, at the age of 93. In the 1982 film Gandhi by Richard Attenborough, J.B. Kripalani was played by Indian actor Anang Desai. His autobiography My Times was released 22 years after his death by Rupa publishers in 2004. In the book, he accused his fellow members of Congress (except Ram Manohar Lohia, Mahatma Gandhi, and Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan) of \\"moral cowardice\\" for accepting or submitting to plan to partition India. A stamp was issued on 11 November 1989 by the Indian Postal Department to commemorate the 101st anniversary of his birth. Trivia Acharya Kripalani was born on the same day as Maulana Azad, who also was a prominent freedom fighter. Kripalani succeeded the latter as the President of the Indian National Congress at the Meerut session in 1946.

Chomsky and starring James Garner, Jenilee Harrison, and C. Thomas Howell. The film was written by Dan Gordon. It was produced by Lorimar Productions and was commercially released in the United States by Universal Pictures on March 16, 1984. Plot US Army Command Sergeant Major Zack Carey (played by Garner) is about to retire from the military after taking his last post in rural Clemmons County, Georgia (loosely based on Fort Benning, largely in Chattahoochee County, Georgia). Despite being offered the possibility of becoming Sergeant Major of the Army, he insists he just wishes to finish his tour and retire in peace to spend time with his family. Several years earlier, his older son had been killed in an Army training accident, and his relationship with his only surviving son, Billy (played by Howell), is strained. Zack's no-nonsense, unpretentious style of leadership quickly earns him a reputation on-post as a tough but fair NCO, well-regarded for his compassion and integrity. Zack owns a vintage Sherman tank from World War II that he has restored with his younger son's help, and he drives it for parades and other public events. While visiting an off-base bar, he meets a young woman named Sarah (Jenilee Harrison) and the two of them strike up a conversation over drinks. During their conversation, the local deputy sheriff, Euclid Baker (James Cromwell) sees them together and orders Sarah to get back to work, insulting her and slapping her in the process. Carey quickly intervenes, subduing the deputy. Sarah had been forced into prostitution by Cyrus Buelton, the corrupt sheriff (G. D. Spradlin). Sheriff Buelton tries to arrest Carey, but finds he has no jurisdiction while Carey is on the base, which is federal property. Upon discovering that Billy attends a public school off-post, Buelton has marijuana planted in Billy's locker and arrests him. When Zack comes to him seeking terms of truce, Sheriff Buelton offers to drop the charges if Carey gives him a hefty bribe, roughly equal to his retirement savings. Zack hesitates and considers the deal, but his wife, LaDonna (Shirley Jones) refuses to take part in \\"good old boy\\" justice and calls a lawyer. The lawyer is thrown into jail himself on trumped-up contempt of court charges, Billy is put on trial immediately without benefit of counsel and sentenced to several years of hard labor. LaDonna, finally realizing the depths of Sheriff Buelton's corruption and cruelty, goes to Zach and tells him what happened. When Carey tries to offer the bribe, Buelton accepts the money, but refuses to release his son, simply stating that it will prevent him from being shot \\"accidentally\\" or while \\"attempting to escape\\", or from being raped by other inmates ‚Äì temporarily. Carey decides to take matters into his own hands, delivers his resignation, and climbs into his vintage tank, destroying the local jail and police station and releasing Billy's lawyer. With Sarah tagging along, Carey departs for the county work farm, where they use the tank to liberate Billy and flee the town. His plan is to escape to neighboring Tennessee, where they can get a fair hearing regarding extradition. While repairing a shed track, though, Carey is injured, and Billy takes command of the Sherman. Sheriff Buelton demands military intervention from Carey's commanding general, Major General V.E. Hubik. The general points out that Carey had already retired from the Army, so he has broken no military law. Buelton then demands that Hubik order the post's personnel and tanks to pursue Carey, and that if refused, he will call the governor of Georgia. General Hubik again declines, this time citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which states that the Department of Defense is prevented from interfering in domestic law enforcement outside the military reservation without approval from his superiors or the President of the United States. (As a running joke for the remainder of the film, an ignorant Buelton misinterprets the act's name as a dismissive insult of himself as a \\"pussy Communist\\".) Through a long series of chases and evasion through rural Georgia, while being aided by relatives of people jailed by Buelton and who died while incarcerated, the tank and its crew quickly become folk heroes. Despite Sheriff Buelton insisting they are criminals, the nation rallies behind them as a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. On the Tennessee side of the line, thousands of people gather to welcome the tank. Meanwhile, LaDonna has met with the governor of Tennessee, where she, with use of a rather direct and blunt threat of blackmail, manages to get a formal guarantee that they will be given a proper extradition hearing. A showdown brews at the Tennessee state line, where a huge crowd of supporters for the tank and its crew has gathered. Using a vintage antitank weapon, Buelton manages to immobilize the tank within a mud flat, forcing Billy to consider surrender. However, a motorcycle gang intervenes and attaches a wire rope to the tank, and the assembled crowd works to pull the Sherman out of the trap. Buelton goes as far as to order his posse to fire at the crowd, prompting a large line of Tennessee state troopers to draw their weapons in response, threatening to \\"turn this into another 'Little Big Horn'\\". Bulton and his men then race into the mud flat and begin pulling on their end against the crowd.. Reaching a stalemate, Major General Hubik takes charge and has a bulldozer brought over to help free the tank. Celebrating his apparent vicotry, Bulton climbs onto the tank and orders its occupants to surrender, but instead, Zack instructs Billy to rotate the tank's turret, which knocks him off and face down into the mud. Meanwhile, the bulldozer begins pulling the tank free of the mud with the renewed help of the crowd. This time, the posse's efforts to stop them are futile, and the tank is successfully pulled over the state line. Zack, Billy and Sarah climb out of the tank to a hero's welcome by LaDonna and the people and the governor of Tennessee. Cast * James Garner as CSM Zack Carey * Shirley Jones as LaDonna Carey * C.

Pastor Kavel was a founder of Lutheranism in Australia. Training and early ministry Kavel was born in Berlin, where he attended the Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster school and went on to study theology. In 1826, he was ordained and installed as the Pastor at the church in the village of Klemzig, located near the city of Z√ºllichau in then southeastern Brandenburg in the German state of Prussia. Between 1798 and 1840, the Protestant churches in Prussia had been subjected to a number of changes, brought about by the decrees of King Frederick William III. These decrees were intended to unify the Lutheran and Reformed Churches into one Evangelical Christian Church. By 1826, there was some opposition to the intentions of Frederick William. This escalated in 1830, when Frederick William announced a number of changes that outlawed the traditional rites of the churches and prescribed a form of worship which many Lutherans believed was against the Will of God. It was in this environment that dissent against the decrees of Frederick William arose. Pastor Kavel was not initially one of this group, who had come to be known as the Old Lutherans. Frederick William's revised edition of the worship agenda, which was released in 1829, was voluntary for usage in congregations, as was the first edition. Pastor Kavel used this worship order until 1834 when, under the influence of the writings of Johann Gottfried Scheibel, he ceased and joined the ranks of the dissenters. Kavel wrote to the King in January 1835, informing him that he would no longer use the worship agenda. On Easter Monday 1835, Kavel was removed from the ministry and was prohibited from practising as a pastor. His congregation likewise were prohibited from using the church premises, and participating in any worship services presided by suspended Pastors. Emigration to Australia Pastor Kavel began to look for avenues to lead his congregation in an exodus from Prussia to a place where they could worship in freedom. In early 1836, Kavel travelled to Hamburg to enquire into the possibility of migrating to Russia or the United States; however, both of these options were not possible. While in Hamburg, Kavel was informed of the possibility of migrating to Australia. He travelled to London, England, to meet with George Fife Angas, the chairman of the South Australia Company, which was searching for emigrants to settle the land acquisitions it had in South Australia. Kavel was received favourably by Angas, who sent his chief clerk, Charles Flaxman, to Prussia to meet with Kavel's group and to prepare them for emigration. Kavel remained in London, ministering to the German community. The congregation in Klemzig went through a number of setbacks in their application to emigrate. Requiring permission from the government, they were informed that their request for emigration had been denied in 1837. Representatives who were sent to appeal against the denial were arrested and imprisoned. It was only at the end of 1837 that the group was finally given permission to emigrate. Financially, the migration was expensive. Angas had lobbied the South Australia Company to provide funding for the Lutheran dissenters, arguing that the character of the people was the ideal type for the new settlement in South Australia. However, due to financial problems within the Company, the request by Angas, which had initially been approved, was now denied. Many of the Prussian migrants had also encountered financial hardship due to the extended emigration application process. A migration to Australia now appeared to be impossible. George Angas decided to personally provide funding to Kavel and the Klemzig group. Four ships were chartered on their behalf: , Bengalee, Zebra and Catharina. Prince George and Bengalee left Hamburg on 8 July 1838 with about 250 of the emigrants. They travelled to Plymouth, where they picked up Pastor Kavel, and then continued on their journey until they arrived in Port Adelaide on 20 November 1838. Zebra left in August 1838 with 187 on board and arrived in Holdfast Bay on 28 December. Eleven people, six adults and five children, died on the trip. Catharina left in September 1838 and arrived in January 1839. In all, this group of ships transported 596 migrants from Prussia to Australia. Settlement in South Australia Pastor Kavel, as the leader of the group of immigrants, acted as a negotiator for securing land for the settlers. These new migrants rented from George Angas and established their first settlement in Australia at Klemzig. On the arrival of the third ship, Zebra, the town Hahndorf was established. A third settlement of the Prussian migrants was established at Glen Osmond by many of the passengers from Catharina. One of Kavel's followers, Johann Friedrich Krummnow, taught the girls en route but was deemed \\"not completely satisfactory and the community did not allow him to teach in Australia\\". On 23 and 24 May 1839, Kavel convened a meeting of the elders of the three villages. At this meeting, the constitution of the new Australian Lutheran synod was adopted. At the following synodical gathering in 1840, a letter was drafted and subsequently sent to the \\"Old Lutherans\\" in Prussia. Its purpose was to encourage others to emigrate and, most importantly, have a second pastor immigrate to Australia. On 28 October 1841, 224 further Prussian immigrants arrived in Adelaide on the Skjold, among them Pastor Gotthard Fritzsche. This group formed the main part of the settlements at Lobethal and Bethanien. At Lobethal Krummnow, who was now a naturalised English citizen and was able to purchase land, the settlers provided him with funds to establish a community: Krummnow wanted it based on his own principles of shared property and fervent prayer. The Lobethal settlers rejected Krummnow's vision and legally disputed his right to the land titles. In 1842, Langmeil was settled. Kavel remained in South Australia until his death. Division in the Church Tension arose between Kavel and the settled migrants at Hahndorf and Klemzig when he strongly urged them to relocate to Langmeil. Family Kavel's parents, Albrecht Christian Kavel (c. 1766 ‚Äì August 1842) and (Charlotte) Sabine Kavel, n√©e Fillgraf, (25 December 1767 ‚Äì 1852) also emigrated aboard Prince George in 1838. *August Kavel married Anne Catherine Pennyfeather, an English woman, on 28 March 1840. She died on 25 December 1841 after giving birth to a stillborn son and was buried in the tiny Klemzig cemetery (Kavels parents would also be buried there). Kavel married again in 1851, to Johanna Beata Irrgang; they had no offspring. *His sister Maria Charlotte Sabine Kavel (2 August 1806 ‚Äì 6 April 1880) emigrated aboard Prince George in 1838 and married (Johann Friedrich) August Fiedler (21 February 1796 ‚Äì 17 September 1880). *Three brothers Johann Wilhelm Ferdinand Kavel, Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Kavel, and Daniel Samuel also emigrated on the same voyage.

The Committee, then called the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, was established pursuant to the Intelligence Services Act 2001Intelligence Services Act 2001, s.28 and was first appointed in March 2002. History The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD (PJCAAD) was established pursuant to the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and replaced the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO (which was established in 1988) and the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services. The PJCIS's purview was expanded from 1 July 2004 to include DIO, DIGO and ONA, following the recommendations of the Flood Inquiry.Report of the Inquiry Into Australian Intelligence Agencies On 2 December 2005, the name of the Committee was changed to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS). The members of the first Committee were appointed in March 2002. Functions The PJCIS's main function is administrative and expenditure review and oversight of ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The Committee can also review matters relating to the three agencies referred to them by Parliamentary Resolution, or by a request from the Minister responsible for the agency in question. The Committee does not review intelligence gathering or operational procedures or priorities, nor does it conduct inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of ASIO, ASIS or DSD.  Reforms  Several major security reforms have been introduced to Commonwealth law, as a result of PJCIS reviews. They include the following: = Assistance and Access Act = The committee carried the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018 through to legislation enabling security agencies to access otherwise encrypted communications by people who intend harm to Australians. Members of the committee expressed satisfaction on the bill becoming law, as it would enable security agencies to \\"surgically strike terrorists, spies, drug traffickers and paedophiles.\\" = Security of Critical Infrastructure Act = Prompted by the sale of the Port of Darwin to interests connected to the Communist Party of China, the Committee made recommendations for the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth) (Act)‚Äî placing a national security test to any foreign investment into energy or water assets and, notably, ports. = Espionage and Foreign Interference Act = In early 2018, the joint committee heard submissions from the intelligence services that indicated Australia was facing an unprecedented threat from espionage and foreign interference. The committee made \\"60 bipartisan recommendations on the government's separate espionage and foreign interference laws, which include greater protections for journalists.\\" = Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme = The committee also contributed amendments to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018. At this time, ZTE and Huawei and other \\"high-risk vendors\\" were deemed as unsuitable technology partners for the rollout of Australia's 5G network. Overshadowed by the leadership controversy, these security decisions went largely unreported. However, security partners, such as Congressman Mike Gallagher would later see that Australia was both the first Western democracy to be targeted by China and the first to protect itself: > Australia was not only the canary in the coal mine for the expansion of > Chinese influence, and just the way that they ruthlessly waged economic and > ideological warfare; but was also the leader of the free world, the first > country to take massive steps to counter that.

Biography  Born into a family of bankers with interests in railways and close links to the court of King Leopold II of Belgium, Georges Nagelmackers trained as a civil engineer.Tanel. Page 94. As a young man he fell in love with an older cousin. When his feelings were not reciprocated, his family encouraged him to travel to the United States of America to help him recover and also further his professional studies. He spent a total of 10 months travelling throughout America during which time he was exposed to train travel on Pullman carriages. He became convinced that there was a market for Pullman type carriages in Europe. After a proposal to George Pullman to collaborate on developing the European market was rebuffed Nagelmackers returned to Europe. Other versions of his biography maintain that Georges Nagelmackers knew about sleeping cars as they were already in operation in Belgium before he traveled to the United States, and that he never actually met George Pullman. In 1870 he published a proposal to develop sleeper carriages for the European market called \\"Projet d'Installation de wagons-lits sur les chemins de fer du continent\\" (Project for the installation of sleeping cars on the railways of the Continent). However the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War delayed the granting of a concession from the Belgian government and the establishment of his first sleeper carriage service. In 1873, Georges Nagelmackers founded the company Georges Nagelmackers & Company, which later became Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL). He headquartered the company in Paris and created the Compagnie Internationale des Grands Hotels to develop and operate luxury hotels throughout its trains' routes. His strategy consisted of convincing train operators to attach his sleeping and restaurant cars to their trains to diversify the train travelers' choices. The first CIWL-only train became operational in 1882. The Orient Express was launched 4 October 1883. Later, he bought the Mudanya-Bursa line and sold it to the French in 1891. He also bought the Izmir-Kasaba Railway in 1893 that he also sold to the French the following year. He competed in the equestrian mail coach event at the 1900 Summer Olympics, winning the gold medal.

They had one son, Richard.Los Angeles Public Library records based on interview with his wife Sparks entered the office of the County Clerk as deputy in charge of the marriage-license division in December 1912 and there was given the nickname \\"Cupid\\" during his tenure. He was ousted as deputy in 1920 after L.E. Lampton was elected clerk,\\"'Cupid' Sparks, Ousted License Clerk, Resigns,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 1, 1920, page II-1. Tension with Clerk Lampton began as Robert refused to publish news of marriage licenses being issued to movie stars. These included the marriage of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford as well Charlie Chaplin and Mildred Harris. Robert also operated an informal matchmaking service from \\"having received thousands of letters from lonely men and women asking for his assistance in securing mates.\\" He and his wife would \\"study the letters, and from the descriptions given we match up the requirements as best we can, and then I put the husband- seekers and wife-seekers in touch with each other by letter. Hundreds of marriages have resulted.\\" Robert said he would continue the practice after his election to the City Council in 1921 but \\"out of office hours.\\"\\"Sparks Will Continue in Cupid Role,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 24, 1921, page III-4 In 1923, on the occasion of his 29th wedding anniversary, he noted that he had issued more than 200,000 marriage licenses and gave this advice to husbands: > Self-preservation and protection is the first law for husbands, and to have > a happy married life, such as I have had, remember the anniversaries with > gifts for the wives.

Sparks placed seventh in the citywide primary of May 1923, with 26,971 votes, and was nominated for re-election. In the June final he came in 11th, with 34,458 votes, and was defeated; only the top nine vote-getters were elected. Sparks was out of the council for two years, but in 1925 he returned as the first person to represent the 5th District under the new city charter, which replaced the former at-large election system with one based on single- member constituencies. He was elected 4,379 votes to John Topham's 3,075.

Other bands active in the early 1980s Los Angeles punk scene were The Adolescents, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, Bad Religion, Agent Orange, and The Stains. Footage of the original lineup (1981-1983) can be seen in the film Slog Movie, which is a film documenting the Orange County punk scene. History The original members of Wasted Youth were Chett Lehrer, Jeff Long, Allen Stiritz, and Danny Spira. = Reagan's In = The band's first album Reagan's In, is in the early West Coast hardcore punk music style. It is known for the Pushead artwork of Ronald Reagan on the front cover. The back of the album features Edward Colver's photograph of an upside down stagediver in midair. Though this album consists of ten tracks, it is less than fifteen minutes long. = Black Daze = The band's later releases moved towards a heavy metal sound, including a cover of Van Halen's \\"On Fire\\".

A Winnipeg, Manitoba native, the 7'0\\", 280 lb (2.13 m, 125 kg) centre was a member of the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets in the National Basketball Association (NBA). MacCulloch also experienced a successful pinball career. MacCulloch was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame on December 5, 2014. Early life A graduate of Shaftesbury High School in Winnipeg, MacCulloch was in 1999 named Honorable Mention All- America as a senior at the University of Washington, when he averaged 24.7 points, 15.9 rebounds, and a .662 field goal percentage. He led the NCAA Division I in field goal percentage in his final three years of college, only the second player ever to accomplish the feat. He was an All-Pac-10 First Team selection in his final two years at Washington. He was drafted by the 76ers in the 2nd round (47th overall) of the 1999 NBA Draft. Basketball career MacCulloch played four seasons in the NBA before being forced to retire prematurely due to a genetic neuromuscular disorder that affected his feet, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In his first two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, MacCulloch played reserve centre, averaging 9.4 minutes, 2.6 rebounds and just under 9 points in 56 and 63 games respectively from 1999 to 2001. In the 2001 off-season, he signed as a free agent with the New Jersey Nets and as their starting centre averaged 9.7 points and 6.1 rebounds a contest. MacCulloch was then traded back to the 76ers for the 2002‚Äì2003 season, in which he averaged just under 20 minutes, 9.1 points, and 4.7 rebounds a contest. Due to an inherited neurological disorder, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which affects the peripheral nerves of the hands and feet he went on the injured reserve list at mid-season, did not play the following season, and announced his retirement in September 2004. MacCulloch played for the Canadian national team of various sorts 93 times, most notably at the 2000 Summer Olympics where the Canadians topped Yugoslavia to win their group only to lose to eventual silver medalist France in the quarterfinals and finish seventh. In an episode of Chappelle's Show, in a skit where African Americans get their reparations, the Philadelphia 76ers play the New York Knicks but none of the black players are playing, so MacCulloch plays one-on-one, beating Travis Knight.Reparations 2003 Follow-up. From the February 12, 2003 Chappelle's Show. Pinball career MacCulloch played pinball whenever he could growing up, at malls, arcades and bowling alleys around town. He began buying up pinball machines when he signed as a free agent with the Nets in 2001 and got his first house. His collection is now greater than 60 pinball and non-pinball arcade games. MacCulloch has played in several pinball tournaments. He competed in the European pinball championship in Stockholm in 2007, and has played in the PAPA World Pinball Championships since 2005, qualifying in the B Division multiple times. In October 2011, MacCulloch won the Pinball Expo in Chicago, beating world champions Keith Elwin and Lyman Sheats on his way to his first major pinball title and a $3,000 cash prize. MacCulloch says there are indeed some similarities between pinball and basketball. He relates: \\"Hand-eye coordination is really important in both, and maintaining your focus is definitely important. I've been in some pressure situations in big [basketball] games, and nerves wouldn't affect me, but I've found that in pinball tournaments, I can't seem to keep those nerves at bay. My heart beats faster, my chest gets tight. Competition is competition, and I thought I'd respond well, but I haven't been able to rein that in yet.\\" References External links *MacCulloch's pro stats at www.basketball-reference *MacCulloch's bio at InterBasket *Story from Slam Sports on MacCulloch's pinball career *MacCulloch's player page on pinballrankings.com Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:1998 FIBA World Championship players Category:Basketball people from Manitoba Category:Basketball players at the 1999 Pan American Games Category:Basketball players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Canadian expatriate basketball people in the United States Category:Canadian men's basketball players Category:Centers (basketball) Category:National Basketball Association players from Canada Category:New Jersey Nets players Category:Olympic basketball players of Canada Category:Pan American Games competitors for Canada Category:Philadelphia 76ers draft picks Category:Philadelphia 76ers players Category:Pinball players Category:Universiade bronze medalists for Canada Category:Universiade medalists in basketball Category:Sportspeople from Winnipeg Category:Washington Huskies men's basketball players Category:Medalists at the 1995 Summer Universiade ","title":"Todd MacCulloch"},{"id":"3009589","text":"The Somerset Dam is a mass concrete gravity dam with a gated spillway across the Stanley River in Queensland, Australia. It is within the locality of Somerset Dam in the Somerset Region in South East Queensland. The main purpose of the dam is the supply of potable water for the Brisbane, Gold Coast and Logan City regions. Additionally, the dam provides for flood mitigation, recreation and for the generation of hydroelectricity. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Somerset. The dam, lake and surrounding village of Somerset are named in honour of Henry Plantagenet Somerset, a local grazier and Member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland who represented the seat of Stanley from 1904 until 1920. Location and features Camping near Lake Somerset. Villeneuve, 2015 The dam is located approximately northwest of in the Somerset Region and north of . The concrete dam structure is high and long. The dam wall holds back the reservoir when at full capacity. However, only is used for water supply and the remainder used for flood mitigation. From a catchment area of that includes much of the western slopes of the D'Aguilar National Park, the dam creates Lake Somerset at an elevation of above sea level, with a surface area of . The gated spillway has a discharge capacity of . Built under the supervision of the Bureau of Industry, management of the dam was transferred to SEQ Water in July 2008 as part of a water security project in the South East Queensland region, known as the South East Queensland Water Grid. A small hydroelectric power station is located adjacent to the dam wall. A water level of 90% is the optimum capacity for keeping evaporation rates to a minimum. Dam operators discharge water into the Wivenhoe Dam downstream to hold Somerset at this level when inflows are occurring. =Construction= The site was first suggested for the location of a dam by Henry Somerset, the owner of Caboonbah Homestead, after the 1893 Brisbane floods caused severe damage to Brisbane River valley residents downstream. A commission of enquiry recommended Stanley Gorge as the site for a dam in 1928, but it was not until 1933 that the Forgan Smith Labor Government adopted the reservoir's construction as a major job creation project to counter job losses caused by the Great Depression. Construction began in 1935. Worker's cottages had to be built and other facilities were constructed to attract construction workers and their families to the area. By 1942 the dam was almost complete when workers were diverted to the war effort, with many being redeployed to construct the Cairncross Dockyard in Brisbane. Work on the dam recommenced in 1948. Opened in 1953 when structural work was finished, it was not until 1958 that the dam was officially named after Henry Somerset and the next year before all work related to the dam, including the hydroelectric power station was complete. Recreation Camping at Lake Somerset. There are two public access areas on Somerset Dam, Kirkleigh and The Spit. Both locations have multi-lane, concrete boat ramps with facilities for day-trippers. Camping is permitted and caravans are catered for at Kirkleigh and below the dam wall at Somerset Park in the small town of Somerset Dam. During busy periods the two camping locations can be filled to capacity with room for a maximum of 2,200 campers at Kirkleigh and 800 at Somerset Park. Lake Somerset Holiday Park's Kirkleigh campground also features cabin accommodation at the waterfront and direct access to the dam from a grassy spit.http://www.bnbfishing.com.au/freshwater/lake-somerset-holiday-park- review/ The dam contains of navigable waterway. =Fishing= The lake is a popular fishing destination, one of the top five fishing spots in the state. Fish species found in the dam include Australian bass, golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, spangled perch, Mary River cod, snub nosed gar, Queensland lungfish and saratoga. A stocked impoundment permit is required to fish in the dam. { A view of Lake Somerset }  Engineering heritage award  The dam is listed as an Engineering Heritage National Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

He is the namesake of the Padovan sequence. Van der Laan Padovan became fascinated with the works of Hans van der Laan after being sent van der Laan's book De architectonische ruimte to review because of his knowledge of the Dutch language. He visited van der Laan beginning in 1980, and continued to correspond with him afterward. He became the translator of the book into English as Architectonic Space: Fifteen Lessons on the Disposition of the Human Habitat (1983), and wrote the book Dom Hans van der Laan: modern primitive (1989) about van der Laan. Padovan numbers In his book on van der Laan, Padovan described the Padovan sequence of numbers :1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 49, 65, 86, 114, 151, 200, 265, ... defined by a recurrence relation :P(n)=P(n-2)+P(n-3) and having properties similar to the Fibonacci numbers.

Other works Padovan is also the author of the book Proportion: science, philosophy, architecture (1999) on the mathematics and philosophy of architectural proportion and proportion systems. One of his arguments in the book is that the use of the golden ratio in architecture is modern, rather than being used for this purpose by the ancient Greeks. He also wrote Towards universality: Le Corbusier, Mies, and De Stijl (2002), about the push to remove individuality from architecture through the works of Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and the Dutch art and architectural movement De Stijl.

The Seatack community of Virginia Beach includes an area inland from the resort strip along present-day Virginia Beach Boulevard. Seatack Elementary School is located nearby on Birdneck Road. The 1903 Seatack Station of the United States Lifesaving Service is now the Virginia Beach Surf & Rescue Museum located at 24th street adjacent to the oceanfront boardwalk. It is also the oldest, historic (formerly) segregated African-American neighborhood in the southern part of Virginia Beach (one of 14 historic formerly segregated African-American neighborhoods in Virginia Beach). Although it is currently a very diverse neighborhood and community that is home to many residents of several races and ethnicities , in the past, it was a practically all-African-American neighborhood until the 1970s. This changed due in part to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (specifically the Fair Housing Anti-Discrimination Act of the CRA1968) and developing infrastructure that spread into the Seatack area of Virginia Beach through the 1960s and 1970s, as part of the city's tourism innovation and infrastructure projects for the resort strip of the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. History Seatack was named so because it was the point on the coast of rural Princess Anne County where the community was the target of cannonballs fired from British ships and was where troops came ashore during an attack in the War of 1812. The isolated stretch of beach place became known as \\"Sea Attack\\", and was gradually shortened to \\"Sea 'ttack\\", and then, finally to the portmanteau of, simply \\"Seatack\\". Seatack was the location of the first \\"resort\\" hotel in Virginia in 1884, which opened after a 19-mile-long narrow gauge railroad was built from Norfolk in 1883. It was remodeled in 1888 and renamed the \\"Princess Anne Hotel\\", a massive 2 block wooden facility, which attracted vacationers from considerable distances from all across the United States. It burned down in 1907. In 1891, while hotel guests watched, surfmen from the Seatack station of United States Lifesaving Service were involved in the rescue efforts for the shipwreck of the Norwegian barque Dictator which ran aground near present-day 37th street. Seven lives were lost, including the Captain's wife and small child, leading to the Norwegian Lady memorials and several local legends. In the early 1900s, the name Seatack became more specifically applied to an area west of the beach, the oldest (formerly) segregated African-American neighborhood in Princess Anne County. According to official Virginia Beach history, before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Black Americans were only allowed to settle in this area because White Americans didn't see any infrastructure value for the swampy, wooded areas of land that made up much of the Seatack area near the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. Black Americans not only settled this area, but also thrived there, and developed it into a highly populated and economically strong neighborhood. Black people who lived in the area called Seatack made many historical accomplishments in the segregated county of Princess Anne, that included raising money to build schools for their children (namely, the Princess Anne County Training School‚Äî1938, among other schools), starting one of the first Black-owned fire stations in Eastern Virginia (the Seatack Fire Station), because the black neighborhood wasn't serviced by the Princess Anne County fire and rescue department at the time, building churches (Mount Olive Baptist, St. Stephens Church of God in Christ (COGIC)) to worship in, and later on, after the passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, a parks and recreation center, and a community daycare center. In 1985, Mr. Joseph V. Grimstead, Sr., who was an African American businessman and civic leader from Seatack, and President of Seatack Community Properties, Inc., dedicated the land for the Seatack Community and Recreation Center to be built. The current facility opened on April 19, 1997. On October 15, 2011, the Seatack Civic League held its 200th Annual Birthday Celebration. It was the first major African American community event ever held in the City of Virginia Beach, and the first large event held at the Virginia Beach Convention Center by African Americans. Bishop Barnett K. Thoroughgood, who was a Pentecostal Church of God in Christ pastor and church leader from Seatack's funeral services were also held there on February 10, 2012 and set a new record of attendance for an African American event having over 4,000. On January 7, 2012 the City of Virginia Beach named the first city building after an African American man, Joseph V. Grimstead, Sr Seatack Community Recreation Center, on the site of the old Seatack Fire Station. Most recently on June 25, 2012 Mayor William D. Sessoms along with senior residents of Seatack and Seatack Civic League officials held the Grand Opening of the Seatack Civic - College Funding Office at 141 South Birdneck Road at the Joseph V. Grimstead, Sr. Seatack Community Recreation Center.www.seatackcivic.org/History.html In 1915, the United States Lifesaving Service became the United States Coast Guard. The station at Seatack (built in 1903 to replace an earlier structure) is now a museum at 24th street adjacent to the boardwalk of Virginia Beach. The area's lifesaving history along the coast line of the Graveyard of the Atlantic is commemorated at the Virginia Beach Surf & Rescue Museum which has artefacts from the shipwreck of the Dictator, displays of period lifesaving equipment, educational programs. The museum also has a webcam which shows Internet users a view similar to that of members of the lifesaving crews had over 100 years ago. The Virginia Beach Surf & Rescue Museum was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Another extant Coast Guard Station was located at Little Island, located south of Sandbridge, Virginia. It is owned by the City of Virginia Beach. However, the Little Island Coast Guard Station is not open to the public. In 2019, Seatack received its official Historic Landmark placard, recognizing that Seatack has been a model for growth within the African American community. This historic recognition led to the honor of being showcased in the construction of the African American Cultural Center of Virginia Beach, where all 14 of the historic African American neighborhoods in Virginia Beach, Virginia will be recognized and experienced. Notable Virginia Beach residents who lived in the Seatack community during a significant portion of their life or who lived in Seatack during their formative years include rappers Pharrell Williams, Timbaland, NFL Football player Eli Harold, astronaut Alan B. Shepard, and actress Chyler Leigh. References =External links= =Books= * William O. Foss The Norwegian Lady and the Wreck of the Dictator. Virginia Beach, Virginia: Noreg Books, 2002. .

History of the Revenue Cutter Service In 1790, the United States Congress empowered the Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to construct ten cutters to acquire custom duties from foreign ships visiting the ports of the young nation.Lt.Worth G. Ross U.S.R.M,\\"Our Coast Guard: A Brief History of The United States Revenue Marine Service\\", \\"Hapers Magazine\\"73:438, November 1886. The ten cutters provided 92% of the young nation's income with collections of custom duties.Captain John Wesler, USCG, Ret. In six years the young nation's debt was paid off to foreign countries. The role of the Revenue Cutter Service would expand to protecting the young nation in times of national security. The Revenue Cutter Service would be placed under the control of the United States Navy. This practice continues today with authorization from the President of the United States. The organization and rank formation of the United States Coast Guard coincides with the United States Navy for such emergencies. The officers and crew of the US Revenue Cutter Service would collect a percentage of the fines, penalties, and forfeitures collected from offenders. In 1878 the United States Congress passed a law that would join the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service to provide assistance to persons that had been shipwrecked. The joining of the two concerns; in regards to Life-Saving was a success. In 1882 superintendent of the United States Life-Saving Service Sumner I. Kimball wrote in a report that the success of the United States Life-Saving Service was enhanced by the Revenue Cutter Service. Sumner I. Kimball stated that \\"little wonder the United States Life-Saving Service has succeeded; the souls of such men have entered it, and it has become an incarnation. In the later years, the efforts of the two Services would help create the United States Coast Guard. The United States Revenue Cutter Service success is shown over a five year period from 1881 to 1885. The numbers that are shown are a yearly average: Saved from drowning 87, assisting vessels in distress 208, value of cargo on vessels $4,498,078, maintenance cost $843,595. History of United States Life-Saving Service On December 14, 1854 the United States Congress passed \\"An act for the better preservation of life and property from vessels shipwrecked on the coasts of the United States.Regulations for the Life-Saving Service for the Government of the United States, http://www.uscg.mil/history/docs/USLSS/1873-USLSS-Regs.pdf The Civil War disrupted the formation of the United States Life-Saving Service.A Legacy of the United States Life-Saving Service, http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/uslss.pdf In the year 1870 a powerful storm caused many deaths and newspaper editors called for \\"reform to check the terrible fatalities off our dangerous coasts\\" In the year 1871 the United States Life-Saving Service was formed under the Department of the Treasury. The Treasury Department appointed a lawyer named, Sumner Increase Kimball as the chief of the Treasury Department's Revenue Marine Division The United States Life-Saving Service was under the Revenue Marine Division. In 1878 the growing number of United States Life-Saving Service stations brought about the USLSS becoming a separate agency. Kimball brought organization and standards to the USLSS that was once a mostly volunteer organization. During the volunteer times, only the \\"keepers\\" of these early stations were paid $200 a year. The crews of the early stations were un-paid volunteers. Through Kimball's guidance the number of Life-Saving Service stations grew to meet the need for rescuing victims of shipwrecks. The unforgivable coast line of the Northeast claimed many lives and much property. The number of USLSS stations was greater in the Northeast than in the moderate climate and more forgiving coastlines of the lower Southeast. The USLSS served the United States with distinction for forty-four years. The success of the USLSS can be seen in economic terms and more importantly; peoples lives. In the forty-four years the USLSS assisted 28,121 ships and saved 178,741 lives. Life-saving stations and the equipment In November 1889 Sumner I. Kimball reported that there were 265 life-saving stations across the United States. The stations are occupied during the months of the active season. The active season was normally for the months of October to March, depending on the needs of the area patrolled. Each station had a keeper that was in charge of the quarters and the Surfmen. The keeper and the Surfmen would be responsible for patrolling the beach and maintaining a watch for vessels in distress. The patrols are conducted twenty-four hours a day during active season. The stations were equipped with surfboat, apparatus cart, Lyle gun, and breeches buoy. The stations located in the Virginia Beach area were Cape Henry, Seatack, Dam Neck, Little Island, and False Cape. The five stations located in Virginia Beach were located approximately two to five miles apart. The Surfmen would patrol the beaches in all types of weather. When storms and dark of night would restrict the visibility of the men in the watchtower, the surfman would patrol the beach. The surfmen would leave at a scheduled time and walk towards the opposite station. Once the surfmen met they would exchange a check. The check was a shaped piece of metal that resembles a modern-day police shield. According to Sumner Kimball the exchanging of checks would insure fidelity of the patrols.Sumner Increase Kimball, Organization and Methods of the United States Life-Saving Service, Washington:Government Printing Office, 1894. The isolated stations would record their patrol times with patrol clock. The clock would register the time when the surfmen reached the end of their patrol. All of the patrols were recorded and logged at the Life-Saving Station. If during a patrol a surfman spotted a ship in trouble, he would signal the ship with a Coston flare that help was on the way. The Coston flare would alert the other surfmen on watch or at the station. The surfmen would man the apparatus cart and pull and push the 1400 pound and above cart through wet sand, gale-force winds, and high surf to render aid to victims of a shipwreck. If conditions dictated it, the surfboat would be used. The surfboat was also placed on a wheeled cart to travel to a wreck. Upon arrival at the shipwreck; the keeper of the station would determine the method of rescue. The Seatack Station and the wreck of the Diktator The first station was built in 1878. The station at Seatack, built in 1903 replacing the earlier structure, is now the museum at 24th street adjacent to the boardwalk of Virginia Beach, Virginia. The folk-lore of the name seatack has two possible explanations. The less probable is the story of a group of local militia that repelled a sea-attack from the British, during the War of 1812. The more likely story is that when mariners cleared Cape Henry, they would begin their first turn or sea tack.Old Coast Guard Station Museum Historical Narrative There were many local heroes of the Seatack Station #2. Surfman John Woodhouse Sparrow was one of them. On December 21, 1900 a powerful storm forced the ship Jennie Hall aground ten miles south of Cape Henry.Richard and Julie Pouliot,Shipwrecks on the Virginia Coast and the Men of the Life-Saving Service 1875-1915, Tidewater Publishers 1985 A surfman from the Dam Neck station named Carroll saw the Jennie Hall disabled, and he alerted his station.Pouliot, Shipwrecks of the Virginia Coast The Seatack Station was notified and a joint effort commenced. The Jennie Hall was a complete loss, but with the efforts of the surfmen there were survivors. Four seamen from the Jennie Hall were saved by surfboat. For his efforts, John Woodhouse Sparrow from the Seatack Station was awarded the USLSS Silver Lifesaving Medal. The wreck of the Jennie Hall is just one of the wrecks that occurred off the coast of Virginia Beach. There are photos, stories, and artifacts from various wrecks including the Diktator displayed at the museum. The Virginia Beach coastline is a part of the Graveyard of the Atlantic. It is the shipwreck of the Diktator that the Seatack Station has been associated with for many years. On March 27, 1891, the Norwegian ship Diktator wrecked off the beach near the Seatack Station. A surfman named John L. Robinson was assigned to Seatack, and he told the story of the rescue. The ship wrecked around 10 am. The keeper of the station was a Captain Drinkwater. Drinkwater told his men that the ship was \\"coming ashore,\\" and ordered them to \\"man the apparatus cart and get ready to go to the wreck.\\"J.L. Robinson, July 1948 Robinson remembers that the storm was so severe that they could not use the beach for the cart. They had to use a \\"country road\\" that was partially blocked by fallen trees. The surfmen had to travel to get to the beach. They arrived at the section of the beach where the ship now lay off the beach; broadside. He tells how waves were breaking over the ship and causing further damage to the ship He tells how the wind was so severe the Lyle gun was fired three times without success. The line that is fired from the Lyle gun has an optimal range of 695 yards, but with perfect conditions. He tells that the wind was so severe, the line would fall short. The men on the ship saw the failed attempts of the Lyle gun and threw a wooden cask over board with a line attached. The cask made it to shore and the surfman placed the line for the breeches buoy in the cask. The crew of the Diktator rigged the line to their ship and prepared for the breeches buoy to be brought out to the ship. The breeches buoy is a life-ring with \\"britches\\" sewn onto the ring. The device would be placed on a hawser line and between the crew of the ship and the surfmen they would transport victims of shipwrecks from ship to shore. The surfmen managed to bring three members of the Diktator safely to the beach, before wreckage of the ship tangled the hawser lines. The crew of the ship and the surfmen worried that time was running out for more rescues, because night was falling quickly. The Captain of the Diktator decided that he and his crew had to get off the ship soon. The Captain lowered a boat from the Diktator with four crew members. The small boat capsized in the large waves and the crew was now in the cold water. The crew started to swim for shore and the large waves pushed them into the shore. The surfmen had made fires on the beach to alert any survivors to their location. Robinson tells how miraculously all four Diktator crew members made it to the beach; alive. He also details how the Captain of the Diktator made his way to the beach. The Captain survived, but others did not, including his wife and their four-year-old son. The Captain tells how he decided to attempt to swim to the shore. He took a ladder from the ship and placed life- preservers on the ladder. The Captain, his wife, and their son would hold onto the ladder and hopefully be washed to the shore. A wave broke over the ladder and he did not see his wife again. The Captain heard his son crying and told him to hold his breath when a big wave broke over them. A large wave came and broke over the two and that was the last time he saw his son. The Captain was the last survivor of the Diktator. A total of ten people survived but the ship was a total loss, with eight people drowned. In 1962 the Norwegian town of Moss sent a replica of the figurehead from the Diktator to the residents of Virginia Beach. A plaque on the figurehead tells how the people of Moss, Norway, commemorate all who perished during the rescue of the Diktator The figurehead is approximately north of the Old Coast Guard Station Museum. The United States Coast Guard In 1915, the United States Lifesaving Service became the United States Coast Guard. The USLSS and the Revenue Cutter Service were combined to make the United States Coast Guard. The Seatack Station #2 became Coast Guard Station #162. The United States Coast Guard is now under the Department of Homeland Security. The Station was decommissioned in 1969 by the Coast Guard. The building was empty for ten years and scheduled for demolition, until Virginia Beach locals gained public support and formed the Virginia Beach Maritime Museum in 1979. The name of the museum was changed to the Life-Saving Museum of Virginia in 1988, but was changed to the Old Coast Guard Museum in 1996. The Seatack Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

It was released in 1982 by Faulty Products and reissued in 1983 by I.R.S. Records when Faulty Products went out of business. The songs remained widely unavailable thereafter, with only occasional rereleases of individual songs. The whole five-song EP was eventually reissued as part of the Bangles' 2014 compilation, Ladies and Gentlemen... The Bangles!. This would be the group's only release to feature original bassist Annette Zilinskas, who left in early 1983 and was replaced by Michael Steele, and did not record with them again until the 2018 multigroup album 3 x 4. A three-song CD Mini Single CD3 version of the EP was released on A&M;/I.R.S. Records in 1988. Background The Bangles began in Los Angeles as a garage rock band, popularly associated with similar bands from the area in the Paisley Underground music scene. After self-releasing a well-received debut single, \\"Getting out of Hand\\" (1981), the group was signed by music industry executive Miles Copeland to his new record label Faulty Products, an independent U.S.-based subsidiary of I.R.S. Records. The band quickly recorded a five-song mini-album which was released in June 1982. Composition The EP includes four original songs penned by bandmembers, as well as \\"How Is The Air Up There?\\", a cover of the 1960s single by New Zealand band The La De Das. Track listing # \\"The Real World\\" (S. Hoffs, V. Peterson) # \\"I'm in Line\\" (D. Peterson, V. Peterson, S. Hoffs) # \\"Want You\\" (V. Peterson) # \\"Mary Street\\" (S. Hoffs, V. Peterson) # \\"How Is the Air Up There?\\" (Steve Duboff, Artie Kornfeld) ;1988 three-song CD Mini Single CD3 Release \\"Bangles\\" # \\"The Real World\\" (S. Hoffs, V. Peterson) Remixed by David Kahne. Previously unreleased. # \\"Mary Street\\" (S. Hoffs, V. Peterson) # \\"I'm in Line\\" (D. Peterson, V. Peterson, S. Hoffs) Personnel The band's full musical credits are listed on the EP's back cover: * Susanna Hoffs ‚Äì rhythm guitar, vocals * Debbi Peterson ‚Äì drums, vocals * Vicki Peterson ‚Äì lead guitar, vocals * Annette Zilinskas ‚Äì bass guitar, harmonica, vocals Vocals are credited to Vicki and Debbie Peterson and Susanna Hoffs on every track. Vicki Peterson sings the lead vocal on \\"Want You\\" and \\"How Is the Air Up There?\\" while Debbie Peterson sings \\"I'm In Line\\"; Susanna Hoffs sings \\"The Real World\\", and she and Vicki Peterson share the lead on \\"Mary Street\\". Annette Zilinskas provides vocals only once, as one of the backing harmonists on \\"Want You\\". Music industry veteran Craig Leon served as the record producer. Leon was already well known in rock and indie circles for his production work with the Ramones and Blondie. Leon also played piano on \\"Mary Street\\" and \\"The Real World\\", and the latter song includes additional piano work by Ethan James. The album cover art was designed by Ewa Wojciak with photography by Bob Seideman. Shortly after the EP's release, Annette Zilinskas left the band and was replaced by former Runaways bassist Michael Steele. Musical style The Bangles' early years were informed by a 1960s garage rock sensibility, and the 1982 EP maintains a stylistic link between the \\"Getting out of Hand\\" debut single and the band's first full-length album, the critically acclaimed All Over the Place (1984). Music critics often note the irony of their subsequent rise from guitar-based rock devotees to \\"one of the most successful chart groups of the '80s with their slickly produced synth pop\\". In his book Music: What Happened?, Scott Miller names \\"The Real World\\" as one of the top songs of the 1980s, and remarks of the EP: \\"Those who know only 'Eternal Flame' might be amazed at how inventive and together they were in their relative infancy\\". The Bangles themselves consider the early material, lesser-known though it was, to be vital to their own story: as Susanna Hoffs told Billboard in 2014, \\"I think it's as representative of who we really are and as authentic as anything the Bangles have ever done. There's a kind of architecture to those songs ‚Äì three- part harmonies, guitar-driven, jangly over a kind of garage rock rhythm is who we are now, still, as much as we were back then.\\" Release The original EP was released on vinyl in 1982 by Faulty Products (catalog #FEP 1302). The label folded at the end of the year, and Copeland's major label, I.R.S. Records, rereleased it again in 1983 (catalog #SP-70506). In 1988, A&M;/I.R.S. Records released a three-song CD Mini Single CD3 with \\"Mary Street\\" and \\"I'm in Line\\" from the original vinyl EP release, and a very different mix of \\"The Real World\\" remixed and remastered by David Kahne prior to his producing the first Bangles album. The full five-song set, however, remained out of print since its initial vinyl release until 2014, when it was included on the album Ladies and Gentlemen... The Bangles!. Featuring numerous early Bangles rarities, this compilation also includes a previously unreleased demo version of \\"The Real World\\", shorter and sung in a different key.

However, on 22 January 2017 a heavy rain storm passed through southern California. This video shows how water from the storm filled up Coyote Creek. The Northern end of the Coyote Creek Bikeway is along Foster Road in Santa Fe Springs There are several homeless encampments along the Coyote Creek Bikeway, especially North of Interstate 5. The Coyote Creek bikeway is a Class 1 bike path in Los Angeles County that runs adjacent to the Coyote Creek flood control channel for approximately 9.5 miles. The bike path is controlled by Caltrans. The path begins in Santa Fe Springs on the North fork of the Coyote Creek and extends south into Long Beach where it joins the San Gabriel River bicycle path at the trail bridge just South of Willow Street/Katella Avenue. Coyote Creek separates Los Angeles County and Orange County. A curious feature of the bikeway is that many of the East/West streets that intersect the flood control channel change names as they cross over. The bikeway is generally devoid of scenery. The northern section of the bikeway passes through industrial neighborhoods consisting of warehouses and light manufacturing. The middle section, from State Route 91 to Ball Road/Wardlow, cuts through residential neighborhoods. There is convenient access to the Don Knabe Community Regional Park, just north of La Palma Avenue/Del Amo Boulevard. The bikeway crosses from the West to the East side of the channel at Centralia Road. The Southern section of the bikeway passes adjacent a collection of zones: light industrial, apartments, schools, etc. In that area there is a simple bike maintenance station, including a tire pump, at a small walking park that is parallel to the bike path and just north of the 605 Freeway. Maintenance The flood control channel is managed by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. Crossing at I-5 reopened with an improved trail in early June, 2015. Future plans The OCTA Commuter Strategic Bikeways Plan (CSBP) calls for extension of the Coyote Creek Bikeway from Walker Street in La Palma to Imperial Highway and Beach Boulevard in La Habra. Currently the cities of La Habra and La Mirada have opened the northern section of this bikeway from Rosecrans Avenue to Imperial Highway. Just north of Rosecrans Avenue a bridge has been installed, allowing direct access from Behringer Park in La Mirada.

In general usage, it is used, with proper form, after a person's name and means \\"teacher\\"; the word is also used as a title to refer to or address other professionals or persons of authority, such as clergy, accountants, lawyers, physicians and politicians or to show respect to someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery in an art form or some other skill, e.g., accomplished novelists, musicians, artists and martial artists. Etymology The two characters that make up the term can be directly translated as \\"born before\\" and imply one who teaches based on wisdom from age and experience. The word prefaced by the adjective Â§ß, pronounced \\"dai\\" (or \\"≈ç\\"), which means \\"great\\" or \\"large\\", is often translated \\"grand master\\". This compound term, \\"dai-sensei\\", is sometimes used to refer to the top sensei in a particular school or tradition, particularly within the iemoto system. For a more senior member of a group who has not achieved the level of sensei, the term is used ‚Äì note the common use of ÂÖà \\"before\\"; in martial arts, this is particularly used for the most senior non-sensei member. The Japanese expression of 'sensei' shares the same characters as the Chinese word ÂÖàÁîü, pronounced xiƒÅnshƒìng in Standard Chinese. Xiansheng was a courtesy title for a man of respected stature. Middle Chinese pronunciation of this term may have been * or *. In modern Standard Chinese, it is used in the same way as the title \\"Mr\\". Prior to the development of the modern vernacular, xiƒÅnshƒìng was used to address teachers of both genders; this has fallen out of usage in Standard Chinese, though it is retained in some southern Chinese Chinese varieties such as Cantonese, Hokkien, Teochew and Hakka, where it still has the meaning \\"teacher\\" or \\"doctor\\". In Japanese, sensei is still used to address people of both genders. It is likely both the current Southern Chinese and Japanese usages are more reflective of its Middle Chinese etymology.  Use in Buddhism  In Sanbo Kyodan related zen schools, sensei is used to refer to ordained teachers below the rank of r≈çshi. However, other schools of Buddhism in Japan use the term for any priest regardless of seniority; for example, this title is also used for J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ ministers in the United States, whether they are ethnic Japanese or not. In the Kwan Um School of Zen, according to Zen master Seungsahn, the Korean title ji do poep sa nim is much like the Japanese title \\"sensei\\". In Nichiren Buddhism, members of the Soka Gakkai International refer to the president of the sangha, currently Daisaku Ikeda, as Sensei.

Their best-known songs are \\"Making Time\\", which was one of the first rock songs to feature a guitar played with a bow, and \\"Painter Man\\", which made the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1966, and reached No. 8 in the German chart in April 1967. It was later covered by Boney M in 1979, and reached the No. 10 position in the UK chart. \\"Making Time\\" was used in the movie Rushmore. Creation biographer Sean Egan defined their style as \\"a unique hybrid of pop, rock, psychedelia and the avant garde.\\" Career =Pre-history: The Mark Four (1963‚Äì1966)= Most of the members of what would eventually become Creation were initially members of The Mark Four, a British beat group based in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.Larkin C 'Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) p132 By late 1963 The Mark Four was a quintet consisting of Kenny Pickett (vocals), Eddie Phillips (guitars), Mick \\"Spud\\" Thompson (rhythm guitars), John Dalton (bass), and Jack Jones (drums). This line-up played regularly in the UK and in Germany before issuing two non-charting singles for Philips‚Äô Mercury Records, \\"Rock Around The Clock\\" and \\"Try It Baby\\" in 1964. Dalton then left the band. He later joined The Kinks as a replacement for Pete Quaife before being replaced by new bassist Tony Cooke. Around the same time, Thompson left the band and was not replaced. This Mark Four line-up issued two further non-charting singles: \\"Hurt Me If You Will\\" (Decca, August 1965) and \\"Work All Day (Sleep All Night)\\" (Fontana, February 1966). In April 1966, the group signed a management deal with Tony Stratton-Smith. He promptly suggested replacing Cooke with new bassist Bob Garner (previously of the Tony Sheridan Band), and a name change. The band took him up on both suggestions: it was Pickett who came up with the name The Creation, based on a reference he found in a book of Russian poetry. =Initial success (1966)= The band's style, produced by Shel Talmy, was, at this point, loud art pop, similar to early records by The Who. Their first single, \\"Making Time\\", was a Pickett/Phillips original featuring Phillips playing his electric guitar with a violin bow (He was reputedly the first guitarist to use this technique). Released in June 1966 on Talmy's own label, Planet (distributed in the UK by Philips and in the US by Jay-Gee), it reached No. 49 on the UK chart. Almost immediately thereafter, The Creation suffered another line-up change when Jack Jones was fired and replaced by new drummer Dave Preston. However, the band was unsatisfied with Preston's live work, and in less than three weeks Jones was asked back and rejoined the group. Their next single, October 1966's \\"Painter Man\\", became their biggest hit, reaching No. 36 UK and the top 10 in Germany. The Creation took their pop art experimentation slightly further when, during live performances of \\"Painter Man,\\" Pickett would spray-paint a canvas during their concerts before a member of the road crew would set fire to the artwork on stage. =The Bob Garner era (1967)= \\"Painter Man\\" was the last single issued by the original line-up, and their last single to chart in the UK. In early 1967, the band brought in Kim Gardner as their new bassist, and former bassist Bob Garner moved into the lead vocal slot in February 1967, leaving Kenny Pickett out of the group, at least for the time being. This line-up issued its first single in June 1967 (\\"If I Stay Too Long\\" b/w \\"Nightmares\\"). Unsuccessful in the UK, the song did well in Germany, as did a German only follow-up single (\\"Tom Tom\\"). Their commercial momentum in Germany was strong enough for a Creation album called We Are Paintermen to be issued in mid 1967 for the German and continental European market, compiled from previously issued singles and several newly recorded songs. By this time, the band's sound had developed into a more typically mid-1960s psychedelic rock sound, which has been retroactively described as freakbeat. Also during late 1966 and 1967, four Creation singles were issued in the United States, without commercial success: \\"Making Time\\" b/w \\"Try And Stop Me\\" and \\"Painter Man\\" b/w \\"Biff Bang Pow\\" on US Planet (distributed by Jay-Gee/Jubilee), and \\"If I Stay Too Long\\" b/w \\"Nightmares\\" and \\"How Does It Feel To Feel\\" b/w \\"Life Is Just Beginning\\" on US Decca. The band remained popular in Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The single \\"Life Is Just Beginning\\" was released in the UK towards the end of 1967, but almost immediately afterwards guitarist Eddie Phillps announced his departure. He was replaced for several European tour dates by guitarist Tony Ollard, but within a matter of weeks, vocalist Bob Garner also quit the group and by February 1968, The Creation had officially ceased to exist. =Pickett returns, band breaks up (1968)= However, demand was still strong in continental Europe for Creation records and live shows, and almost immediately after the band had disbanded drummer Jack Jones formed a new Creation line-up, bringing back Kenny Pickett as singer. Kim Gardner returned as bass player (after a stint in Santa Barbara Machine Head) and brought in his old bandmate from The Birds, Ronnie Wood on guitar. This line-up debuted with the single \\"Midway Down\\", released in the UK and Germany in April 1968. However this Creation line-up splintered almost immediately, and by June, the band was no more. Two posthumous follow-up singles: \\"Bony Moronie\\" and \\"For All That I Am\\" were German only releases, appearing later in 1968. Despite their early demise and lack of hits, The Creation posthumously became highly influential, acknowledged as an inspiration by Paul Weller, Ride, Pete Townshend, The Sex Pistols and others. Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin imitated Phillips‚Äô use of the violin bow, while Alan McGee named his massively successful record label Creation after them. Egan asserted, ‚Äúonly the Velvet Underground spring to mind as a band who profoundly affected fellow artists while remaining a secret from the wider public.‚Äù =Post-Creation careers= Eddie Phillips became bass player in P.P. Arnold's backing band during the late 1960s. He left the music business for a time in the 1970s, but by 1980 was collaborating again with Kenny Pickett as a songwriter. The two wrote the 1980 hit single \\"Teacher, Teacher\\" for Rockpile. Kenny Pickett continued as songwriter for the Creation's American producer, Shel Talmy, and issued some solo recordings in the 1970s and 1980s. He later sang with The Kennedy Express. In 1970 he co-wrote Clive Dunn's Number One hit \\"Grandad\\", with session musician Herbie Flowers. Ronnie Wood joined the Jeff Beck Group, and later The Faces and The Rolling Stones. Kim Gardner co-formed Ashton, Gardner & Dyke and was later a member of Badger. Bob Garner played in Warrington bands Magoos and Golliwog, who changed their name to Smiley for a single in 1972: \\"Penelope\\" (written by Kenny Pickett) b/w \\"I Know What I Want\\" (written by Garner). He later participated in various Creation reunions (see below). Jack Jones became a cabaret singer. Mick Avory was the drummer for the Kinks from 1964 to 1984. =Reformations (1980s ‚Äì present)= The Creation re-formed in the mid-1980s with Phillips, Pickett, Dalton, and Mick Avory (drums, ex- Kinks). In 1987, they released a single on Jet Records (\\"A Spirit Called Love\\" b/w a new version of \\"Making Time\\") to minimal attention. This line-up also recorded material for a new album in a more contemporary rock style (such as new wave), but this project was never completed (or even titled). The reformed band continued to tour, with various line-up changes, capitalising on their cult notoriety with the underground mod and garage rock audiences. In 1994, the original line-up (consisting of Phillips, Pickett, Garner and Jones) got together to record the album Power Surge, issued in 1996 on UK indie label Creation Records, which had been named in honour of the group. The 1990s band Ride, who had excursioned with The Creation in 1994, then recorded the song \\"How Does It Feel to Feel?\\" on their album, Carnival of Light. Some years earlier The Godfathers, another UK alternative rock band of the time, had also included a cover of the song on their 1991 album Unreal world, so that the tune \\"How Does It Feel to Feel?\\" became quite popular in the 1990s in the UK indie scene. Pickett died on 10 January 1997 but the group continued for a time with Garner as lead vocalist. The band performed in the United States for the first time in 2001. In 2004, Cherry Red Records released Psychedelic Rose, made up of nine songs from the group's abandoned 1987/88 sessions including the tracks previously issued on the 1987 single, augmented by two spoken-word recollections of The Creation's history; the few reviews of the album were almost uniformly negative. Garner and Jones both left the band sometime in the early 2000s; Garner died on 16 July 2016. The only original member left in the current line-up is Phillips. The most recent Creation touring line-up consists of Eddie Phillips (lead guitar, vocals), Simon Tourle (lead vocals), Tony Barber (bass), and Kevin Mann (drums).

Encyclopaedia Britannica Early life and medical career Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari was born on 25 December 1880 in Yusufpur-Mohammadabad town in eastern Uttar Pradesh). Educated at the Victoria School, Ansari and his family moved to Hyderabad. Ansari obtained a medical degree from the Madras Medical College and went to England on scholarship studies. He achieved the M.D. and M.S. degrees in 1905. In 1910 Ansari earned a Master of Surgery (ChM) from the University of Edinburgh for his thesis Treatment of syphilis by arylarsonates with special reference to recent research. He was a top-class student and worked at the London Lock Hospital and the Charing Cross Hospital in London. He was an Indian pioneer in surgery, and today there is an Ansari Ward in the Charing Cross Hospital, London, in honour of his work. From 1921 to 1935, Ansari visited Vienna, Paris, Lucerne and London to meet with famed urologists, including Robert Lichtenstern, Eugen Steinach and Serge Voronoff, some of the pioneers of grafting animal testicles onto humans. In the last decade of his life, Ansari performed over 700 such grafting operations, meticulously recording 440 of them. From these experiments he published his book Regeneration of Man, which he shared with his close friend Mahatma Gandhi. Dr Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari was a freedom fighter who also grafted animal testicles onto humans. Scroll.in (10 May 2017). Retrieved on 12 December 2018.

Cuddie Springs is an open site, with the fossil deposits preserved in a claypan on the floor of an ancient ephemeral lake. The claypan fills with water after local rainstorms and often takes months to dry, a fact which facilitated the survival of fossils over a long period of time. The site provided the first unequivocal association of stone artefacts with fossil remains of Australian megafauna. Cuddie Springs has been known as a fossil megafauna locality since the late 1870s, when a well was sunk into the centre of the claypan. The Australian Museum launched excavations in 1933 and while many bones were found, no archaeological discoveries were made in that initial research. More extensive excavations were conducted between 1991 and 1996 by a team from the University of New South Wales and were continued between 1997 and 2009 through the University of Sydney. Etymology It was recorded that the word 'Cuddy' in the language of the \\"Marra Blacks\\" means bad . This has been interpreted as a reference to the quality of the water found in the Cuddie lake, which is alkaline with a pH between 7 and 9 . Despite the name, Cuddie Springs is an ephemeral lake, and not a spring. Excavation history In the historic period, Cuddie Springs was known to both Aboriginal and European people as a palaeontological site. A Dreamtime story about Mullyan the eaglehawk is associated to the formation of the bone deposits at the site and the formation of the Macquarie Marshes to the south and the site is also part of a Dreaming track tied to the Macquarie Marshes and the Geera waterhole on the Barwon River . Europeans first settled in the area around Cuddie Springs in the 1830s. A well was sunk into the middle of the claypan in 1876, the disused superstructure of which was still present in the 1920s. During the sinking of the well in the 1870s several large fossilised bones were recovered and were sent to the Australian Museum, some of which were later sent to Richard Owen who identified the fossils as belonging to different genus of Diprotodon, Euowenia, Nototherium, Genyornis, various Macropodidae, Megalania and at least one genus of crocodile, Pallimnarchus . Despite attempts in the 1920s to excavate it was not until 1933 that the first excavations took place at Cuddie Springs. Led by the Australian Museum, the principal researchers described the excavation thus: > We commenced our excavations about 10 yards from the well, working towards > the centre, and before work was stopped, about five weeks later, the claypan > resembled the fields of Flanders, with a complicated series of trenches and > pits, mostly about 5 feet in depth, but in one case about 15 feet . Though a range of paleontological material was recovered from the site, no archaeological material was identified in the 1933 excavation . Full scale excavations at the site recommenced in 1991 after excavations designed to test the possibility of pollen preservation at the site uncovered a high concentration of bone and a dense layer of flaked stone artefacts, indicating the site had archaeological as well as paleontological potential . The main archaeological excavations were carried out between 1996 and 2009. The majority of the excavated material is currently stored at the Australian Museum. Site setting Cuddie Springs is located within the semi-arid zone, but palynological evidence indicates that 40,000 years ago there was a large permanent lake surrounded by open shrub land suitable for supporting megafauna . Evidence for human co-existence with Australian megafauna The excavators of Cuddie Springs reject humans as the primary cause of megafauna extinctions. They conclude that the 10,000 years of co-habitation of humans and megafauna at Cuddie Springs suggests that climate changes that began before the human colonisation of Australia were responsible for the megafauna extinctions. cite the staggered extinctions that have been occurring since at least 130,000 years ago and the fact that megafauna in Tasmania do not occur after 46,000 years ago but people only arrived across a land bridge at 37,000 years ago. This staggered decline, mostly occurring in contexts independent of humans, is linked to environmental evidence for increasingly arid and erratic conditions since 400‚Äì300,000 years ago. The large body size of the megafauna suggests low fecundity and low population densities which have been argued to have made them susceptible to extinction due to habitat loss from increasing aridity . The 10,000 years of co-habitation of humans and megafauna at Cuddie Springs that is the foundation of Wroe and Field's argument has been the subject of intense critical examination. This critique has identified a number of details that weaken the integrity of the association between humans and megafauna. First are the finds themselves, such as relatively large number of grinding stones in Pleistocene-age layers , as well as tula-adze-like flakes . The Pleistocene grinding stones are notable because they imply a broad-spectrum plant-processing economy much earlier than previously known in Australia . These finds are anomalous because in other parts of Australia they are restricted to late Holocene contexts . Amongst the megafauna bone layers there is a tooth of a crocodile, Pallimnarchus sp., that became extinct long before 40,000 years ago . The tooth is also exfoliated and heavily mineralised and the preservation is not consistent with other bone and teeth in the same level. There are stone artefacts with hair and blood adhering, but in the same layers there are megafauna bones with not even traces of protein remaining ; ; ; . These inconsistent finds suggest that the process of site formation may have involved some mixing of materials of different ages. This leads to the second important detail, the stratigraphy. Cuddie Springs is unusual in having a dense deflation pavement that separates recent materials (such as cow bones) from the Pleistocene layers. The layers above the pavement contains cow bones mixed with megafauna bones but the layers below contain no cow bones . has asked where the rocks in this pavement come from in a stone-poor riverine plain, and suggested that they may have been carried by Aboriginal people from a gibber plain 4 km from the site or by farmers during the late 19th or early 20th century to create a firm footing for people or cattle. also suggest that the stone artefacts in the pavement are unusually dense for a Pleistocene archaeological site and may have been transported during well construction or represent an in situ but late Holocene archaeological site overlaying disturbed Late Pleistocene sediments. There is a long history of European activity at Cuddie Springs, with a well dug in 1876, ten metres from the 1990s excavation and trenches dug by the Australian Museum in 1933. These events likely caused disturbance of the stratigraphy. Gillespie and Brook add that cattle visiting the well may have pushed stone artefacts through the pavement into the Pleistocene layers during waterlogged conditions. Tracing the origins of the pavement is crucial to understanding the integrity of the Pleistocene layers. Several authors have suggested that the Pleistocene stone artefacts and megafauna bones may have derived from separate contexts that have become mixed by underground water flow. Because it is a ground-fed spring and a site that is periodically inundated by rain, sediment at Cuddie Springs is highly likely to have been moved by water. The depth of the historic well suggests that the ground water level may have been near the level of the Pleistocene layers . suggest that the upright orientation of an unarticulated Genyornis femur in the Pleistocene layers at Cuddie Springs might be explained by sediment movement by water flow is responsible for. This suggests that the megafauna bones might derive from much older sediments and have been reworked into the stone artefact bearing layers. A more direct link between the stone artefacts and the bones would be cut marks on the bones, but there are \\"few cut marks on any bones\\" at Cuddie Springs (Field, et al. 2001: 698). Evidence favour of an intact Pleistocene deposit comes from analysis of rare-earth elements (REE) in the megafauna bones. The REE contents of the bones suggests that each depositional unit contains fauna with a discrete chemical signature and, therefore, a discrete and distinct postdepositional history, arguing against any postdepositional movement and mixing of bone between stratigraphic horizons . comment that this still does not exclude an off-site origin of the bones (i.e. death of the animal) and subsequent fluvial transportation to Cuddie Springs. Field et al. (2006) dispute the proposal that flood movement caused the combination of megafauna and stone artefacts. They report that the sediments enclosing the bones and stones are fine-grained silts and clays resulting from a low-energy flow of water. They argue that if floods were responsible then larger sediments such as sands and gravels would have been found also. The possibility of mixed Pleistocene deposits is also suggested by some interpretations of the chronology of the site, a third focus of the critiques (figure 6). So far, there are 20 radiocarbon dates and seven luminescence dates published for Cuddie Springs . Statistical analysis by Gillespie and Brook (2006) of the 16 radiocarbon dates from the Pleistocene layers (ranging from 28 to 33,000 years ago) suggest that they do not increase in age as depth increases. They interpret this to mean that the sediments have been disturbed since they were first deposited. The luminescence dates also suggest mixing, with Roberts et al. (2001) finding that the sediments sampled for dating have multiple palaeodose populations, suggesting that sediments in the same sample were deposited at different times, rather than all at the same time. As mentioned above, the megafauna bones contain undetectable amounts of protein, so direct dating of the bones has so far been unsuccessful ; . The uniqueness of archaeological and palaeontological finds from Cuddie Springs and its unusual stratigraphy have attracted detailed critiques that cast doubt on the integrity of the human-megafauna coexistence. Despite these problems, Cuddie Springs is uniquely significant as a major focus of research into the question of how the Australian megafauna became extinct.

He made Hong Kong his home for 50 years, during which he did much for the benefit of the colony, and finally founded the Hong Kong University. Biography He was born in Bombay and moved to Hong Kong around 1860. At the time there was a large community of Parsi merchants based in Hong Kong, including Dorabjee Naorojee Mithaiwala, who founded the Star Ferry and Jehangir Hormujee Ruttonjee who helped establish the Hong Kong Ruttonjee Sanatorium. Mody arrived in Hong Kong in 1858 with help from his uncle Jehangirjee Buxey.The Life & Times of Sir Hormusjee Naorojee Mody. Zoroastrian.org.uk. Retrieved 28 August 2011. He spent his early days in the colony as an auctioneer of opium, then a legally respectable activity. After working at Bank of Hindustan, China and Japan and later Buxey and Company, Mody partnered with another Indian immigrant, Sir Catchick Paul Chater,http://chater-genealogy.blogspot.ca/2016/10/sir- hormusjee-mody-his-family-and-their.html to form the brokerage company Chater and Mody which enjoyed great success in the real estate/land business. Mody saw the potential of buying and developing land in Kowloon after it was ceded to the British in 1860. Both partners also participated in the great Praya Reclamation Scheme of 1887. Mody contributed towards founding of University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Jockey Club and Kowloon Cricket Club  Family  Sir Hormusjee Mody and his wife Maneckbai had five children, 4 boys and a girl. * Sirinbai Mody married to Nusseranji Dady, they had a son Hormusjee. * Merwanjee Mody 1858-1910 * Naoroz Hormusjee Naoroji Mody 1875-1944 * Jehangirjee Hormusjee Mody 1876-1949 * Dinshawjee Hormusjee Mody 1882-1920  Contribution towards founding of University of Hong Kong  A bust of Sir Mody in the University of Hong Kong Mody was a friend of the Hong Kong Governor, Sir Frederick Lugard and his wife Flora Shaw, who wished to found a university in Hong Kong. Mody offered to contribute a great sum of money, $150,000, to help establish the University of Hong Kong, provided it was matched by donations from other sources. His donation, eventually almost doubled to $285,000, was a very significant component of the total endowment for the inception of this institution. At the foundation ceremony on 16 March 1910, Mody summed up his reasons for contributing towards HKU \\"As a young man, the advantages of education were unfortunately not within my reach, and I have to- day at my advanced age to confess myself 'no scholar'. Throughout my long life I have daily realised all I have missed for want of a sound education, and it was with the idea of in some measure providing for others what I was myself denied that I determined to offer to erect at my own cost a building which should bring within their reach those educational advantages which I have myself so greatly missed\\". Hong Kong Telegraph 17 March 1910 rightly summed up this event taking queue from the speech of Viceroy of Canton during the ceremony. ‚Äú....They Built Better Than They Knew‚Ä¶..‚Äù Sadly, Sir H.N. Mody did not survive long enough to see opening of the university. The University was officially opened on 11 March 1912. Sir Hormusjee Mody‚Äôs son Naoroz Hormusjee Naoroji Mody attended the opening ceremony, and said: \\"Your Excellency [Lord Lugard], it is with feelings of the utmost pleasure and pride that I proceed to perform the duty which devolves upon me of formally in the name of my late father, presenting this University building, to the community, and requesting that you, Sir, may be pleased to declare the same open, and, on behalf of my mother, I also desire to express her regret that, through ill health, she is unable to be present this day‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I desire to express to your Excellency the satisfaction which my mother and family feel on this auspicious occasion when the work so nobly undertaken by your Excellency and my father, is about to be brought to so successful and fitting a conclusion‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I would add that had my father been spared to see this day his heart would have rejoiced at this realisation of his hopes. I may further state that I have given instructions for the making of a silver model of the main Building of the University which, when complete, I would ask your Excellency to accept as a souvenir of this opening ceremony, which is, I think a memorable one in the annals of the Colony\\".

Commemoration A bronze bust of Sir Hormusjee N. Mody was presented by the Incorporated Trustees of the Zoroastrian Charity Funds of Hong Kong, Canton and Macao to commemorate the 90th Anniversary of the University. It resides on the main staircase of the main building. Every year on founder's day, the Parsi community of Hong Kong visit the Hong Kong University along with university students and officials to remember him. A small prayer is said by a Parsi Zoroastrian priest in front of bust of Sir Hormusjee N. Mody. Every year Mody Handicap race is run in his honour by the Hong Kong Jockey Club.

Clusius mentioned the species as growing in the Antwerp garden of a certain Everardus Munichoven, who reportedly got the plants from Peru. Clusius writes: Primum autem locum merito sibi vindicabit elegant et rarissimus ille, quem, ex Peruano orbe delatum, in suo horto alebat Everardus Munichoven et florentem suis coloribus exprimi curabat.

Chemically it is the sodium analogue of saltpeter. Nitratine crystallizes in the trigonal system, but rarely occurs as well formed crystals. It is isostructural with calcite. It is quite soft and light with a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and a specific gravity of 2.24 to 2.29.

The rare crystals when found typically have the scalenohedral form of the calcite structure. It is found only as an efflorescence in very dry environments. It is very soluble in water such that it is deliquescent and will absorb water out of the air and turn into a puddle of sodium nitrate solution when exposed to humid air. Nitratine was once an important source of nitrates for fertilizer and other chemical uses including fireworks. It has been known since 1845 from occurrences in the Confidence Hills, Southern Death Valley, California and the Atacama Desert, Chile.

It is used in varying context from \\"having zero members in a set\\" (e.g., null set) to \\"having a value of zero\\" (e.g., null vector). In a vector space, the null vector is the neutral element of vector addition; depending on the context, a null vector may also be a vector mapped to some null by a function under consideration (such as a quadratic form coming with the vector space, see null vector, a linear mapping given as matrix product or dot product, a seminorm in a Minkowski space, etc.). In set theory, the empty set, that is, the set with zero elements, denoted \\"{}\\" or \\"‚àÖ\\", may also be called null set. In measure theory, a null set is a (possibly nonempty) set with zero measure. A null space of a mapping is the part of the domain that is mapped into the null element of the image (the inverse image of the null element). For example, in linear algebra, the null space of a linear mapping, also known as kernel, is the set of vectors which map to the null vector under that mapping.

It is the hypothesis which is presumed true‚Äîunless statistical evidence indicates otherwise.

Nulls occur because different parts of an antenna radiate radio waves of different phase. In directions at which the antenna radiates equal amplitude radio waves of opposite phase, the radio waves cancel, resulting in little or no radio power being radiated in that direction. In other directions the radio waves from different parts of the antenna are in phase and reinforce, resulting in a maximum signal strength in the radiation pattern, called a lobe. In transmitting antennas designed to provide broad coverage nulls can be a problem, preventing reception in a given area. Null fill in the vertical plane is used to prevent this. On the other hand, nulls can also be used to advantage. In a radio receiver the receiver's antenna can be adjusted so the direction of the interference source is located in a null of the antenna, to minimize reception of interference. Nulls have also been used intentionally to prevent an antenna from broadcasting to a certain area. For example, CIII-DT-22, a repeater of Toronto-based Global TV station CIII-DT in Wheatley has a null towards Windsor to protect broadcast rights of American stations in the bordering Detroit area. Radio direction finding (RDF) receivers use special antennas with very narrow, sharp nulls to find the location of transmitters. The antenna is rotated until the received signal is minimum; at that point the antenna's null is pointed along the bearing line to the transmitter.

Tracheoles are about 1 ¬µm in diameter, and they convey oxygen to cells while providing a means for carbon dioxide to escape. Tracheoles branch from the larger tracheae (which can be several mm in diameter) much like capillaries branch from arteries, or twigs from branches of a tree. This increases the surface area for gas exchange in the insect. Areas of intense metabolic activity, such as the digestive tract and flight muscles have very dense aggregations of tracheoles. Though usually closely associated with cells, tracheoles physically penetrate only the flight muscle cells which have the highest oxygen demands. Unlike the larger tracheae which are derived of ectodermal stem cells, tracheoles do not molt with the insect. Instead, they remain in place and fuse themselves to new tracheae at each molt by a cement they produce.Klowden, M. J. 2007. Physiological systems in insects. Elsevier/Academic Press. pp. 440-442.

Timberlake over many issues, including a controversial $1 million plan to build public housing in Los Angeles (Timberlake favoring and Henry opposing), with Timberlake disputing many of Henry's rulings from the chair.

They are sometimes referred to as Borneo frogs, slender-armed frogs, or dwarf litter frogs. Description Leptobrachella are small frogs that are not easily seen as they are well camouflaged on the ground. However, their advertisement call is loud, and they can be abundant along streams. The tadpoles of Leptobrachella are unusual in their vermiform or eel-like appearance. The transition from the narrow, cylindrical trunk into the strong tail is nearly seamless, and the tail fin is very low. This body shape is interpreted as an adaptation to a fossorial life style: Leptobrachella tadpoles live in the gravel beds of small streams. In Leptobrachella mjobergi where more detailed observations have been made, tadpoles have unusually mobile head and trunk. While smaller tadpoles seem to use existing interstitial spaces, larger ones can actively push their way through gravel.

It was originally named for its first discovery in feces, but was later found to be common in soil, water, and environments in association with humans. While opportunistic infections do occur, the bacterium is generally considered nonpathogenic. When an opportunistic infection does occur, it is usually observed in the form of a urinary tract infection. A. faecalis has been used for the production of nonstandard amino acids. Description A. faecalis is a Gram-negative bacterium which appears rod-shaped and motile under a microscope. It is positive by the oxidase test and catalase test, but negative by the nitrate reductase test. It is alpha-hemolytic and requires oxygen. A. faecalis can be grown at 37 ¬∞C, and forms colonies that lack pigmentation. Metabolism The bacterium degrades urea, creating ammonia which increases the pH of the environment. Although A. faecalis is considered to be alkali-tolerant, it maintains a neutral pH in its cytosol to prevent the damaging or denaturing of its charged species and macromolecules. History A. faecalis was first described in 1919 by Castellani and Chalmers. In 2001, previously unidentified isolates of Alcaligenes were classified as a new subspecies of A. faecalis: A. faecalis parafaecalis. In 2005, a second subspecies of A. faecalis was described: A. faecalis phenolicus. A. faecalis phenolicus is distinguished by its ability to use phenol as a carbon source.

They are characterized by a stocky body with slender, short hindlimbs. In identifying species, iris colour is a valuable diagnostic morphological characteristic (see Leptobrachium bompu for an example of a blue-eyed species); the iris has uniform colour in some species, whereas in other species the upper half is coloured and the lower half is dark. Leptobrachium boringii male at the height of the breeding season. Nuptial spines are clearly visible. This character has been used to define subgenus Vibrissaphora. The sister taxon of Leptobrachium is a clade that includes Scutiger and Oreolalax. Subgenera Two subgenera, Leptobrachium and Vibrissaphora, are recognized; the latter was originally described as a genus, with Vibrissaphora boringii as the type species. These subgenera (or genera) were originally separated by presence (in Vibrissaphora, hence the common name moustache or spiny toad) and absence of nuptial spines on the upper labium in males during the breeding season (in Leptobrachium). Later genetic analyses have not supported this original separation, but still indicate the presence of two distinct clades. These clades can be referred to as subgenera Leptobrachium and Vibrissaphora, but their contents differ from the earlier, purely morphological definition (Vibrissaphora contains all spiny species, but also non-spiny ones). Subgenus Vibrissaphora thus defined is distributed in southern China and Indochina, and subgenus Leptobrachium in the Malay Peninsula and the Malay Archipelago northwest of the Wallace Line.

After disbanding in 2006, drummer Brian Hill now plays with The Soft Pack, while singer Brandon Welchez and Charles Rowell formed the duo Crocodiles. Members * Brandon Welchez - Vocals/Saxophone * Willy Graves - Bass (Deceased) * Charles Rowell (A.K.A. Charles Rowland, Sir Charles or Chuck) - Guitar * Brian Hill - Drums (A.K.A. B.H. Peligro - in tribute to drummer D.H. Peligro of the Dead Kennedys) * Cody - Bass (2001) * Dan Maier - Bass (2001‚Äì2003) Background On their earlier work, their music incorporated elements of punk rock in a jazz-oriented improvisational and constructional sequence, whilst later works incorporated a more noise and lo-fi approach. Their name is taken from the book Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century by Greil Marcus, itself a reference to a line in Guy Debord's 1978 film In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni. The band was known for their confrontational live shows. While performing on their 2005 tour with The Blood Brothers and Big Business, each member wore a red armband with \\"PLOT\\" written in a white circle, intentionally mimicking the armbands worn by members of the Nazi Party. The armbands were in keeping with thematic/aesthetic elements associated with the 3rd Reich that was prevalent on their album Love in the Fascist Brothel. Live shows often included \\"everything from smashing the stage, molesting the microphone to random acts of homo-erotic behavior.\\" Welchez often walked into the crowd to spit on, kiss, touch or undress members of the audience, especially men, to which some people took offense. At one stop on their final tour, Brandon even insisted on half of the audience joining the band on-stage during \\"SLC Hunks\\" and encouraged them to \\"brutalize\\" the band. Welchez also claims they caused a \\"near riot\\" in Salt Lake City, and caused a \\"piss waterfall\\" in Baltimore, which led to them being banned from playing in the city. The Plot won the San Diego Music Award's \\"Best Punk Act\\" award two years running, in both 2005 and 2006. Breakup On September 26, 2006, The Plot announced via a Myspace bulletin that their then- current U.S tour would be the band's last before disbanding. Their final show was in their hometown of San Diego. A posthumous release of a seven-song mini- LP entitled \\"Saviors & Suckers\\" on Three One G records was in the works, but Three One G has since said they will not be releasing the title. Aftermath Brandon, William, and Brian (with the addition of Andrew Miller) created The Prayers, a more 1960s pop influenced band that released a cd/12\\" EP entitled \\"God Save the Prayers\\" on Art Fag Records in mid 2007. Willie and Brian have since left The Prayers, Willie replaced by Chuck Rowell and Brian replaced by Joel Issac Black. Charles Rowland and The Vultures have released an album entitled Vulture Land and are also planning to put out a single called \\"Let Them Bleed/Sex Bomb\\" on Collective Records. Sir Charles has also written two books: Darkland and Friends, Lovers, and Suckers (with Wes Eisold). Dan Maier, the original bass player and recording engineer for the first few Plot releases, continues to produce and record albums in San Diego. Brandon and Sir Charles also participate in Skull Kontrol, an odd conglomerate that usually also involves Welchez's bandmate Andrew Miller and Mario Orduno of Art Fag fame. Skull Kontrol's mission is to put on amazing parties, mainly at clubs in the San Diego area, featuring combinations of its four main members and various other musicians/artists/creative-types DJing and causing a scene. The Prayers broke up in March 2008, having released only one recording and having completed only one US tour, with two brief trips to the UK. Brandon and Sir Charles have since reunited as a two-piece; Crocodiles. Brian Hill is currently playing drums in The Soft Pack (aka The Muslims). Willy Graves died Monday, September 15, 2008, as per information supplied by his mother. Style and influences Plot's style is a fusion of the genres: post-hardcore, jazz, post-punk, noise rock, indie rock, spoken word and hardcore punk. The band took influences from John Zorn, Swing Kids, Miles Davis, Drive Like Jehu, Bad Brains and Fugazi.

The youth also try many driving stunts in cars like drifting and wheeling in bikes as this is a paradise for driving along the shore. There is an unpaved road winding through coconut groves leading to the beach. To get to this road, if you are driving from Tellicherry towards Kannur, take the left turn just before the first railway crossing you encounter after crossing the Moidu bridge. The beach is about 5 km long and curves in a wide area providing a good view of Kannur on the north. Local laws allow beachgoers to drive for a full 4 km directly on the sands of the beach. The beach is bordered by black rocks, which also protect it from the stronger currents of the ocean. These rocks provide habitat for Blue mussel, a delicious seafood. Beach attracts bird-watchers from far off places as hundreds of birds flock here during various seasons. Approximately 100‚Äì200 m south of the beach there is a private island called Dharmadam Island (Pacha Thuruthu in Malayalam, which translates to Green Island in English). It is possible to walk to the island during low tide from the nearby Dharmadam beach. Tourism Since the late 1990s, the beach has seen a steady influx of European tourists during winter. A major share of foreign and domestic tourists are not aware of the potential of this elusive destination. It is a must see destination for Indians as well as foreign tourists. After the face lift of the beach there has been a huge improvement in the facilities available to the beach visitors including resorts, roads, etc. The beach is wide and the sand is firm enough to support smooth driving. Bird Watching Hotspot Whimbrel at Muzhappilangad Beach Lesser crested terns Ruddy turnstone Despite a tourist destination the beach is a bird watching hotspot too. More than thirty species of migratory birds visit here in the winter. Among them Pectoral sandpiper and Caspian plover, sighted here in 2013 were reported for the first time in Kerala. Long, broad shore and rocky formations on the either side of the beach provide a safe place for migration. =Species= *Egrets *White bellied sea eagle *Eurasian Oystercatcher *Black- winged Stilt *Plovers *Eurasian whimbrel *Eurasian Curlew *Sandpipers *Common Greenshank *Common Redshank *Ruddy Turnstone *Sanderling *Little Stint *Ruff *Gulls *Terns *Brahminy kite *Black kite *Asian Openbill'Birds of Kerala: Status and Distribution'; ; DC Books, Kerala, 2001 Accessibility Nearest Airports: * Karipur International Airport - 100 km * Kannur International Airport - 25.7 km Nearest Towns / Railway stations : * Thalassery - 7 km * Kannur - 15 km * Edakkad Railway Station - 1 km * Mangalore railway station - 157 km By road: On National Highway 66 the beach is situated between Kannur town and Thalassery town.

Raised in Pataskala, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, Reuben got his start in rapping by taking the bus into the city to rap on open mic nights and participate in rap battles at the age of fifteen. Reuben later released Monuments, an independent EP, which caught the attention of Gotee Records. They took a chance, signing him to the label and releasing his first project, Are We There Yet?, in 2000. TobyMac, the founder of Gotee Records, provided vocals for the album's final track, \\"God is Love.\\" The album was nominated for a Dove award in 2002. Reuben in September 2005 Reuben's next release, Hindsight (2002), continues his use of a wide variety of musical genres and thoughtful, often funny lyrics. The album was praised as a \\"truly eclectic and creative hip-hop album that blends old-school sounds with progressive production.\\" Once thought to be a Christian version of Eminem, Reuben's first two releases established him as an original, witty, sarcastic musician, as well as Gotee's top-selling solo rap artist.Farias, Andree (December 2003). \\"John Reuben - Professional Rapper.\\" Christianity Today. Retrieved February 6, 2007. Reuben in 2005 Professional Rapper (2003) marked Reuben's debut as a self-producing artist. The album is noticeably different from his previous efforts, using more instruments and less DJ sampling for the tracks. Along with these differences, the album is noticeably darker in both lyrics and feel. It includes several somber tracks which allow a glimpse into Reuben's struggles and self-doubt. Adrienne Camp of The Benjamin Gate contributes vocals to two tracks on the album. The following year Reuben released So In Hindsight the Professional Rapper Isn't There Yet (2004), an album of remixed versions of songs from his first three albums.Farias, Andree (December 2004). \\"John Reuben - So in Hindsight the Professional Rapper Isn't There Yet.\\" Christianity Today Retrieved February 7, 2006. The Boy vs. The Cynic (2005) continued Reuben's trek from the non-serious songs which characterized his earlier work to music that's far more somber and meditative. Reportedly, when the time came for him to submit his work for the album, Reuben turned in enough tracks for two albums, one light hearted, the other more serious. Rather than releasing a two disc release, the label decided to splice them together into The Boy vs. The Cynic. Relient K's Matt Thiessen contributed to the album's second track, \\"Nuisance\\". Tim Skipper of the band House of Heroes appeared on the track \\"So Glad\\". On this album most of Reuben's songs used more \\"traditional\\" musical instruments, typically the guitar, though he experimented with many different instruments and musical styles. At this time Reuben also filmed and released the pilot for a reality show detailing his \\"rise\\" to stardom while poking fun at many of the conventions of reality television. Though the show was never picked up the pilot was released on YouTube. Reuben released his fifth album, Word of Mouth, on February 6, 2007 which took on more experimental characteristics, with the aid of Beck producer Joe Baldridge. Allmusic.com called Word of Mouth an \\"unqualified triumph\\" and said that \\"You won't find a truer, more honest, or more celebratory album this year.\\" Two songs from the album, \\"Focus\\" and \\"Good Evening,\\" were included in the 2007 video game, Thrillville: Off the Rails.

In 2010 a best of collection entitled Zappin was released, before Reuben entered an unannounced musical hiatus that would span until fall of 2016. It was at this time that in anticipation of his next album, Reuben released two singles, \\"Old as Religion\\" on September 16, and on December 9, a collaboration with Issac Ryan Brown and Aaron Cole, titled \\"Angel and Drums\\". On May 19, 2017 Reuben independently released his seventh studio album Reubonic.

The games focus around the career of a motion-picture stuntman. It takes the player through various movies in which they perform dangerous stunts as called by the game. Critical reaction to Stuntman varied. The game was hailed for its innovative gameplay and physics, but was criticized for being linear and its difficulty level requiring too many retries of levels. The game was followed up with a sequel, titled, Stuntman: Ignition, in 2007. Gameplay Stuntman has three single-player modes: Stuntman Career, Stunt Construction and Driving Games. In Stuntman Career, the player must attempt a series of car chase stunt scenes. Each track has several stunts, which are indicated with visual cues and in voice. The player must complete each track in a limited time and with a specified accuracy of the stunts to be able to proceed to the next scene. After all the scenes of the film are completed, a theatrical trailer of the film is shown that combines pre-rendered scenes with highlights from the car scenes based on the actual performance of the player. After succeeding a scene, the player is rewarded with money based on accuracy and time, and unlocking of vehicles and tools for the construction mode. After completing a scene, the player can watch a playback and optionally save it. The career mode allows the player to participate in six films, each filmed in a different location and in a different genre. Toothless in Wapping is a gangster film made in London and resembles Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (both of which were directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Jason Statham). A Whoopin' and a Hollerin' is inspired by Dukes of Hazzard set in rural Louisiana. Blood Oath is filmed in Bangkok and is inspired by John Woo-films. Conspiracy is a Tom Clancy-type thriller where the player uses a snowmobile in Switzerland. The Scarab of Lost Souls is based on the Indiana Jones films where the player uses a jeep and troop carrier in Egypt. Live Twice for Tomorrow is a parody of James Bond where the player uses sports cars in Monaco. Between films, the player must perform stunts in front of crowds at a stadium. The Stunt Construction mode allows the player to create their own stunts by placing equipment in an arena and then perform the stunts. The Driving Games mode involves tests of vehicle control, such as maneuverability, precision and timing. Development The game's soundtrack contains two songs by Overseer: \\"Basstrap\\" and \\"Velocity Shift.\\", During the E3 2006 Expo, it was announced that THQ had acquired the rights to the Stuntman franchise. Also announced was a sequel for next-generation systems being in development at Paradigm Entertainment. On 28 February 2007, THQ announced Stuntman: Ignition was released on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 on 28 August 2007. Reception The Game Boy Advance version received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PlayStation 2 version received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Maxim gave the PS2 version a score of eight out of ten and said, \\"If you think the best parts of movies involve explosions, car chases, and death-defying leaps (is there anything else?), then this homage to Hollywood‚Äôs unsung lunatics is just the thing for you.\\" However, FHM gave the same version a score of three stars out of five and called it a \\"Genuinely great idea, but incredibly frustrating.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave said version a C and advised players to \\"Wear a helmet while playing, because you'll be banging your head against the TV in frustration.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the same version a score of all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40.

Trial He was charged with 3 counts of ‚Äúattempting to distribute an infringing copy of a copyright work (otherwise than for the purpose of, in the course of, any trade or business) to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright, without the licence of the copyright owner, contrary to sections 118(1)(f) and 119(1) of the Copyright Ordinance, Cap. 528 and section 159G of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 200‚Äù and 3 counts of an alternative charge of ‚ÄúObtaining access to a computer with dishonest intent, contrary to section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 200‚Äù.

The maximum penalty under law was four years in prison. At the Tuen Mun Magistracy, Magistrate Colin Mackintosh said that he had reduced the term because this was Chan's first offence and the first sentencing for such a case in the world. However, the judge claimed that anyone else caught illegally sharing files in the wake of his judgment could expect tougher treatment. Appeals He was released on bail for HK$5000 while waiting for the results of the appeal to the High Court. On 12 December 2006, the High Court upheld the original verdict and sentence. He was jailed immediately. The High Court denied him leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal, but he was bailed for HK$5000 on 3 January 2007 to seek leave for appeal at the CFA (leave can be granted by either the High Court or the CFA). On 7 February, the CFA granted him leave. Oral arguments were held on 9 May 2007. Chan's lawyer said the word \\"copies\\" only refers to tangible objects like CDs and tapes. Digital files don't count. He also said that UK law distinguish between the two by having separate \\"Distribution Right\\" for tangible objects and \\"Communication Right\\" for intangible files. Also, it is the downloader that initiated the transfer, thereby copying the work. Chan merely put it on the net. The government's lawyers disagreed. The decision is reserved. The judge from the court of final appeal ruled out Chan's appeal on 18 May 2007. The result was that Chan's appeal was rejected, and the original sentence (3 months in jail) was upheld.Êµ∑ÈóúÊ≠°ËøéÂè§ÊÉëÂ§©Áöá ‰∏äË®¥ÈßÅÂõû from Yahoo! news HK (Chinese Traditional) .

Personal life Milbank was born to a Jewish family, the son of Ann C. and Mark A. Milbank. He is a graduate of Yale University, where he was a member of Trumbull College, the Progressive Party of the Yale Political Union and the secret society Skull and Bones. He is a graduate of Sanford H. Calhoun High School in Merrick, New York. In 1993, Milbank married Donna Lynn DePasquale in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic ceremony. After that marriage ended in divorce, in 2017 he married Anna Greenberg, daughter of Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg and stepdaughter of Democratic Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT). Career Milbank covered the 2000 and the 2004 presidential elections. He also covered President George W. Bush's first term in office. After Bush won the 2000 election, Karl Rove asked The Washington Post not to assign Milbank to cover White House news. In 2001, a pool report penned by Milbank which covered a Bush visit to the U.S. Capitol generated controversy within conservative circles. According to Milbank, the nickname given to him by the president is \\"not printable in a family publication.\\" Milbank writes \\"Washington Sketch\\" for the Post, an observational column about political theater in the White House, Congress, and elsewhere in the capital. Before coming to the Post as a political writer in 2000, he covered the Clinton White House for The New Republic and Congress for The Wall Street Journal. Milbank was criticized for a July 30, 2008 article in which, in part by using snippets of quotations, he portrayed Barack Obama as being presumptuous. A few days later MSNBC's Keith Olbermann stated that Milbank would not be allowed back onto his show, which Milbank had appeared on since 2004, until Milbank submitted \\"a correction or an explanation.\\" However, Milbank had apparently already left Olbermann's show for another show on CNN. Milbank stated that he has been dissatisfied since he was criticized by Olbermann's staff over making a positive comment about Charlie Black, a John McCain senior advisor, and as a result had already been negotiating with CNN. Milbank and Chris Cillizza appeared in a series of humor videos called \\"Mouthpiece Theater\\" which appeared on The Washington Post's website. An outcry followed a video in which, during a discussion of the White House \\"Beer Summit\\", they chose new brands for a number of people, including \\"Mad Bitch Beer\\" for Hillary Clinton. Both men apologized for the video and the series was canceled. Books Milbank is the author of Smash Mouth: Two Years in the Gutter with Al Gore and George W. Bush‚ÄîNotes from the 2000 Campaign Trail. Homo Politicus: The Strange and Scary Tribes that Run Our Government was published by Random House in January 2008. In 2010, Doubleday released Milbank's polemic biography of conservative pundit Glenn Beck: Tears of a Clown: Glenn Beck and the Tea Bagging of America, which a review in Milbank's paper, The Washington Post, said was a \\"droll, take-no-prisoners account of the nation's most audacious conspiracy-spinner.\\" Political views Milbank has stated that his \\"policy\\" on presidential general elections is to vote for the best candidate who is not on the ballot. He voted for John McCain in 2000, Chuck Hagel in 2004, and Michael Bloomberg in 2008. He has explained that his approach allows him to \\"go through the exercise of who would be a good president\\" while avoiding committing to one candidate or another in the race. Greg Marx, associate editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, describes Milbank as \\"extravagantly contrarian.\\" Marx and New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen have critiqued what they view as \\"Milbank's insistence on characterizing political debate as consisting of two unreasonable poles, and himself as a truth-teller caught in the middle‚Äîa posture so habitual and inflexible that it has become an ideology.\\" Milbank has criticized the growth of the White House Correspondents' Dinner, writing in 2011 that the event \\"was a minor annoyance for years, when it was a 'nerd prom' for journalists and a few minor celebrities. But, as with so much else in this town, the event has spun out of control. Now, awash in lobbyist and corporate money, it is another display of Washington's excesses.\\" References External links *Dana Milbank - The Washington Post *Dana Milbank's website *Dana Milbank discusses his new book - January 2008 * Category:American newspaper reporters and correspondents Category:American broadcast news analysts Category:American political writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Jewish American journalists Category:The Washington Post journalists Category:Yale University alumni Category:Skull and Bones Society Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Merrick, New York ","title":"Dana Milbank"},{"id":"3010006","text":"Inning is a municipality in Bavaria, Germany, in the district of Starnberg, in the Regierungsbezirk of Oberbayern.

It has been described as tasting like \\"a fruitier Dr Pepper\\" or like Ironport soda. After Fidel Castro became Cuba's dictator and oversaw nationalization of private property in 1960, \\"Inversiones Rabanal\\" run by Jesus Larrazabal (husband of Teresa Rabanal ‚Äì Manuel's daughter) along with the Ironbeer of Cuba families (Rabanal, Larrazabal, Rojas) were exiled in Miami. The U.S. version of Ironbeer Softdrink, without the bell on logo, is owned and operated by the Blanco Family. History In 1991, Ironbeer's sister company, Sunshine Bottling, got into a business venture with Tropicana, which was looking for a new bottling company. Ironbeer then invested heavily into expanding Sunshine Bottling Co. to get it ready for the demands of this really enormous contract. Subsequently, Tropicana made a demand about the percentage of air in each can of their orange juice‚Äîan impossible demand, industry experts said, and one outside the terms of their contract‚Äîand extricated themselves from it. Ironbeer's CEO, Pedro Blanco Sr., sued Tropicana and eventually won a considerable sum for production costs and damages, but not before the huge legal bills sent Ironbeer into bankruptcy court. They emerged from bankruptcy in 1999. The softdrink along with a few others and the Sunchy line of juices is still being bottled in Miami by Sunshine Bottling Company. The company is still currently owned and operated by president and CEO Carlos Blanco Sr., Pedro Blanco Sr. has since died. Ironbeer cans give the following story about its origins: :On a summers afternoon, in 1917 a mule-drawn, wooden wagon arrived at a popular cafeteria in Havana, Cuba. It delivered the first four cases of a new soft drink that would soon be called \\"The National Beverage\\". Now more than 80 years later, IRONBEER is still enjoyed for its refreshing flavor with just a hint of island spices. A lot can change over the years ‚Äì but not the original flavor of IRONBEER!  Legacy  In 2019, a beer inspired by the original Ironbeer was launched by Miami-based microbrewery Beat Culture Brewery; the beer was called Iron Bier. Ironbeer imagery has also been appropriated by artists and incorporated into the fine arts, most notably by Cuban-American artist Ric Garcia.

Kaloyev held Peter Nielsen (16 August 1967 - 24 February 2004), the sole air traffic controller in Switzerland who was handling traffic the night of the collision, responsible. In 2004, Kaloyev travelled to the Swiss town of Kloten, where he killed Nielsen, who had since retired from air traffic work. Later, after his release from prison, Kaloyev was appointed deputy minister of construction of North Ossetia-Alania. In 2016, upon retirement from the local Ossetian government, Kaloyev was awarded the highest regional medal by that government, the medal \\"To the Glory of Ossetia\\". The medal is awarded for the highest achievements, improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of the region, for educating the younger generation and maintaining law and order. Background Skyguide memorial to the aviation accident and homicide of Peter Nielsen. Vitaly Kaloyev had lost his wife Svetlana Kaloyeva () and two children, 10-year-old Konstantin () and 4-year-old Diana () in the √úberlingen mid-air collision two years earlier. Yuri Kaloyev, the brother of Vitaly Kaloyev, reported that he suffered a nervous breakdown following the loss of his family.\\"Nothing left to lose: grief-crazed murder suspect haunted by family's air deaths,\\" The Guardian Retrieved 6 May 2008. Vitaly Kaloyev participated in the search for the bodies and located a broken pearl necklace owned by his daughter, Diana. He also found her body, which was intact as the trees had broken her fall. Svetlana's body landed in a corn field, and Konstantin's body hit asphalt in front of an √úberlingen bus shelter.\\"Father killed air traffic chief over fatal crash,\\" Times Online Retrieved 6 May 2008. Kaloyev spent the first year after the accident lingering at the graves of his family and building a shrine to them in his home. At the memorial service for the first anniversary of the tragedy, he asked the head of Skyguide about the possibility of meeting the controller who had been responsible for the disaster, but received no response. Kaloyev then hired a Moscow private investigator to find Nielsen's address outside Z√ºrich, before travelling to the former air traffic controller's home in Kloten. =Murder of Peter Nielsen= On the afternoon of 24 February 2004, he set off for Nielsen's house. A neighbour spotted Kaloyev and asked what he wanted. He waved a piece of paper with Nielsen's name on it. The neighbour pointed to Nielsen's front door, but instead of knocking, Kaloyev sat down in the garden.\\"Peter Nielsen stabbed to death\\", The Age February 29, 2004. May 6, 2008. Nielsen, who had lived in Switzerland since 1995, spotted the intruder, went outside and asked what he wanted. His children accompanied him into the garden as well, but his wife tried to call them back; she was still inside when she heard a \\"kind of scream\\". Nielsen was stabbed several times and died of his injuries a few minutes later in the presence of his wife and three children. Answering questions from the judge, Kaloyev said the plane crash above Lake Constance had ended his life. He said his children were the youngest on board Flight 2937, so there was no need for him to identify the bodies. Kaloyev said he was crushed by the loss of his family: \\"I have been living in the cemetery for almost two years, sitting beside their graves\\". Kaloyev presented a document received from a law firm in Hamburg dated 11 November 2003. It was an agreement in which Skyguide offered him 60,000 Swiss francs for the death of his wife and 50,000 francs for the death of each of his two children. In return, Skyguide asked Kaloyev to decline any claims to the company. The document infuriated him; he decided to meet the company director Alan Rossier and Nielsen in person. \\"Apparently he did not expect that he would have to answer for the results of his work,\\" Kaloyev said. \\"He murmured something to me. Then I showed him some pictures of my children and said: \\"They were my children. What would you feel if you saw your children in coffins? I was infuriated about Skyguide's initiative to haggle over my dead children.\\" Kaloyev wanted Nielsen to apologize to him for the death of his family. \\"He hit me on the hand, when I was holding the envelope with the photographs of my children. I only remember that I had a very disturbing feeling, as if the bodies of my children were turning over in their graves\\", he said. Kaloyev offered no explanation for why he brought the weapon with him on a peaceful errand and initially denied the killing entirely. =Trial= On 26 October 2005, Kaloyev was convicted of the premeditated killing (a charge that falls between murder and manslaughter in Switzerland) of Nielsen and sentenced to eight years in prison. In 2007, he was paroled by the court, but the prosecution appealed the decision. On 23 August 2007, the court accepted the appeal, so that Kaloyev remained in prison. On 8 November 2007, Kaloyev was released from prison, as part of his parole. =Return= Returning to his home in North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz, Kaloyev was met with enthusiastic crowds who cheered him as a hero. Members of the youth movement Nashi were standing with the accompanying acclamation: \\"You are the real man.\\"\\"Man who murdered Swiss flight control officer returns to Russia as national hero,\\" Pravda.ru November 14, 2007. \\"Kaloyev is a hero. Those guilty of causing air crashes often remain unpunished. Such a radical punishment is the only way to make them carry responsibility for their crimes,\\" said Vitaly Yusko, a member of a Russian organisation dedicated to helping the relatives of air crash victims. Many Russians shared that sentiment, and believed that he committed \\"a heroic deed avenging for the death of his family.\\" The positive reaction and appointment in Russia were met with a negative reception in Switzerland.Kramer, Andrew E.\\"Plane Crash Remembered; One Mourner Not Welcome.\\" The New York Times. 30 June 2012. Retrieved on 5 February 2013. The Swiss government asked Kaloyev to repay the costs of his imprisonment, about US$157,000. Kaloyev has refused to do so. When Kaloyev travelled to Germany to attend the 10th-anniversary memorial, he was detained by German authorities, saying that he was on a Swiss watch list. Russian consular authorities protested the detainment. The Germans released Kaloyev after Russian diplomats agreed to accompany him. In his native North Ossetia, Kaloyev was appointed Deputy Minister of Construction of the Republic. He held this post until 15 January 2016, when he retired, receiving the highest state award by the local government, the medal \\"To the Glory of Ossetia\\", on his 60th birthday. The medal was awarded for the highest achievements, improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of the region, for educating the younger generation and maintaining law and order. Kaloyev remarried more than a decade after the air tragedy, in approximately 2012 or 2013, to a woman named Irina Dzarasova, who was an engineer at OAO Sevkavkazenergo. On 25 December 2018, Irina gave birth to their twins: a boy, Maxim, and girl, Sofia. A petition was filed to the government of North Ossetia-Alania on 15 June 2015 to dismiss Kaloyev from his position of deputy minister because it damages relationships of Russia with other countries.

Long Chair in Democratic Studies in the Department of Government and is Co-Director of the Thomas Jefferson Center for Core Texts and Ideas at the University of Texas at Austin. He has also taught at the University of Toronto and Yale University. He is a student of Leo Strauss. Education and career Pangle was born and grew up in Gouverneur, New York.Alphonso, Caroline. \\"Law feeding brain drain: U of T loses leading professor to U.S. over Ontario's mandatory retirement.\\" Globe and Mail: 20 Feb. 2004. He graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1966, \\"with distinction in all subjects\\" and ranked fifth in class, having studied political philosophy under Allan Bloom. Pangle received his Ph.D. in political science in 1972 from University of Chicago. His dissertation was \\"Montesquieu and the Moral Basis of Liberal Democracy,\\" completed under the supervision of Joseph Cropsey, Herbert Storing, and Richard E. Flathman. From 1971 to 1979 he taught at Yale University, first as a lecturer and then as an assistant professor and associate professor. In 1979 he was appointed to Graduate School at the University of Toronto as an Associate Professor and was awarded tenure. He became a professor in 1983 and was named University Professor in 2001. During his tenure at the University of Toronto Pangle was first a fellow at Victoria College from 1979 to 1984 and then at St. Michael's College from 1985 to 2004. Pangle left the University of Toronto after 25 years to accept the position of Joe R. Long Chair in Democratic Studies in the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin, citing concerns about mandatory retirement. Pangle was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1984 and at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales in 1987. Pangle is married to fellow professor Lorraine Smith Pangle, who was also a faculty member at the University of Toronto and is a professor in the Department of Government at the University of Texas.  Academic interests  Pangle's writings on ancient political philosophy attempt to show how Socratic arguments for the supremacy of the philosophic life shape, enrich, and ground the classical republican teaching on civic and moral virtue and on the spiritual goals of self-government. His studies of medieval and biblical political thought seek to revive the mutually challenging dialogue between the competing Socratic and scriptural notions of wisdom and of the cultivation of wisdom in civic life. His interpretations of the thought of the American Founding, and of its philosophic foundations in Locke and Montesquieu, prepares the ground for his exposition of Nietzsche as the most radical critic of modern rationalism. These studies argue for the significance, within modernity, of a continued if eclipsed commitment to the life of understanding pursued for its own sake. At the same time, Pangle diagnoses the costs and the benefits‚Äîfor civic virtue as well as for the life of the mind‚Äîof the diminished public or civic status of the moral and intellectual virtues in modern republicanism. Pangle is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, and has won Guggenheim, Killam-Canada Council, Carl Friedrich von Siemens, and four National Endowment for the Humanities fellowships. He has been awarded The Benton Bowl at Yale University (for contribution to education in politics) and the Robert Foster Cherry Great Teacher of the World Prize, Baylor University. In 2007 he delivered, at the invitation of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, the Werner Heisenberg Lecture. A Festschrift in his honor was published as: Recovering Reason: Essays in Honor of Thomas L. Pangle. Edited by Timothy Burns. Lexington Books, 2010.  Pangle's conception of philosophy Inspired and guided by Leo Strauss's revival of Platonic political philosophy, Pangle's work has as its unifying aim the clarification and defense of the original Socratic conception of political philosophy. In the manner that Pangle understands it, the Socratic conception is controversial. What the Socratic conception of political theory amounts to, Pangle contends, is a lifelong vindication, through conversational refutations that purify common sense notions of justice and nobility, of self-knowledge and of inquiry into the nature of things as the highest and supremely fulfilling dimension of human existence. This notion of the true human good, as the good that makes all relativistic and egalitarian outlooks appear impoverished, obviously contradicts or directly clashes with what most people today are told and believe is the life they ought to lead. Pangle asserts that the awakened philosophic life is the only truly human life. Yale tenure controversy Pangle was denied tenure at Yale University, in a scandal, during which a senior colleague explained, in a pronouncement (which became the theme of a protest panel at the annual convention of the American Political Science Association): \\"academic freedom is one thing, but there are two types who will never be permitted tenure at Yale: Leninists and Straussians.\\" The Wall Street Journal (\\"Dry Rot at College,\\" Editorial Aug. 31, 1979, p. 6), Commentary (\\"God and Man at Yale‚ÄîAgain,\\" by Robert Kagan, February, 1982; Letters exchange, August, 1982) and other journals (The New York Review of Books, May 12, 1983, pp. 56‚Äì57, \\"Saving the Free World: An Exchange,\\" statement by Eugene Genovese; Yale Political Monthly, Dec. 1979, pp. 2‚Äì11, \\"Academic Freedom at Yale: the Pangle Case\\"), published editorials, columns, and articles attacking Yale's denial of academic freedom. Yale or its spokespersons denied the imputations. Yale set up a judiciary panel, led by the historian Edmund Morgan, to hear the case‚Äîamid campus-wide protests and marches on Pangle's behalf (Yale Daily News, Sept. 10, 1979, p. 1, \\"2,300 Students Protest Tenure Policy\\"); the panel decided in Pangle's favor and rescinded the decision denying tenure by the Department of Political Science, on the basis of testimony from graduate students about what Political Science faculty had declared in public about the grounds on which Pangle was being denied tenure. Yale instituted a new procedure that took the decision out of the hands of the department and lodged it in a board, specially designed for Pangle's tenure review, that was composed of five scholars, two not from Yale (led by Peter Gay): Yale University News Release, Monday afternoon, Oct. 15, 1979; Yale Weekly Bulletin and Calendar, Oct. 22-29, 1979, p. 1; Yale Daily News, Extra Edition, Oct. 16, 1979, \\"Pangle Wins New Tenure Review: Original Decision Overruled; Professor says he is 'gratified'\\". At that point, Pangle resigned, having been offered a tenured position at the University of Toronto (see entries on C. B. Macpherson and Allan Bloom)‚Äîand because, as he declared, he no longer felt he could comfortably live with his colleagues in the Yale Political Science Department.

It is thus a special case of a moduli space. Depending on the restrictions applied to the classes of algebraic curves considered, the corresponding moduli problem and the moduli space is different. One also distinguishes between fine and coarse moduli spaces for the same moduli problem. The most basic problem is that of moduli of smooth complete curves of a fixed genus. Over the field of complex numbers these correspond precisely to compact Riemann surfaces of the given genus, for which Bernhard Riemann proved the first results about moduli spaces, in particular their dimensions (\\"number of parameters on which the complex structure depends\\"). Moduli stacks of stable curves The moduli stack \\\\mathcal{M}_{g} classifies families of smooth projective curves, together with their isomorphisms. When g > 1, this stack may be compactified by adding new \\"boundary\\" points which correspond to stable nodal curves (together with their isomorphisms). A curve is stable if it is complete, connected, has no singularities other than double points, and has only a finite group of automorphisms. The resulting stack is denoted \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g}. Both moduli stacks carry universal families of curves. Both stacks above have dimension 3g-3; hence a stable nodal curve can be completely specified by choosing the values of 3g-3 parameters, when g > 1. In lower genus, one must account for the presence of smooth families of automorphisms, by subtracting their number. There is exactly one complex curve of genus zero, the Riemann sphere, and its group of isomorphisms is PGL(2). Hence the dimension of \\\\mathcal{M}_0 is equal to :\\\\begin{align}\\\\dim(\\\\text{space of genus 0 curves}) - \\\\dim(\\\\text{group of automorphisms}) &= 0 - \\\\dim(\\\\mathrm{PGL}(2))\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -3 .\\\\end{align} Likewise, in genus 1, there is a one-dimensional space of curves, but every such curve has a one-dimensional group of automorphisms. Hence, the stack \\\\mathcal{M}_1 has dimension 0. = Construction and irreducibility = It is a non-trivial theorem, proved by Pierre Deligne and David Mumford, that the moduli stack \\\\mathcal{M}_g is irreducible, meaning it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper substacks. They prove this by analyzing the locus H_g of stable curves in the Hilbert scheme :\\\\mathrm{Hilb}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^{5g - 5 -1}}^{P_g(n)} of tri-canonically embedded curves (from the embedding of the very ample \\\\omega_C^{\\\\otimes 3} for every curve) which have Hilbert polynomial P_g(n) = (6n-1)(g-1) (note: this can be computed using the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem). Then, the stack :[H_g / \\\\mathrm{PGL}(5g-6)] is a construction of the moduli space \\\\mathcal{M}_g. Using Deformation Theorysection 1, Deligne and Mumford show this stack is smooth and use the stack :\\\\mathrm{Isom}_S(C,C') of isomorphisms between stable curves to show that \\\\mathcal{M}_g has finite stabilizers, hence it is a Deligne‚ÄìMumford stack (named after their paper). Moreover, they find a stratification of H_g assection 3 :H_g^o \\\\coprod H_{g,1} \\\\coprod \\\\cdots \\\\coprod H_{g,n}, where * H_g^o is the subscheme of smooth stable curves, * H_{g,i} is an irreducible component of S^* = H_g \\\\setminus H_g^o, and analyze the components of \\\\mathcal{M}_g^0 = H_g^0/\\\\mathrm{PGL}(5g-6) (as a GIT quotient). If there existed multiple components of H_g^o, none of them would be complete. Also, any component of H_g must contain non-singular curves. Consequently, the singular locus S^* is connected, hence it is contained in a single component of H_g. Furthermore, because every component intersects S^*, all components must be contained in a single component, hence the coarse space H_g is irreducible. From the general theory of algebraic stacks, this implies the stack quotient \\\\mathcal{M}_g is irreducible. = Properness = Properness, or compactness for orbifolds, follows from a theorem on stable reduction on curves. This can be found using a theorem of Grothendieck regarding the stable reduction of Abelian varieties, and showing its equivalence to the stable reduction of curves.section 5.2 =Coarse moduli spaces= One can also consider the coarse moduli spaces representing isomorphism classes of smooth or stable curves. These coarse moduli spaces were actually studied before the notion of moduli stack was introduced. In fact, the idea of a moduli stack was introduced by Deligne and Mumford in an attempt to prove the projectivity of the coarse moduli spaces. In recent years, it has become apparent that the stack of curves is actually the more fundamental object. The coarse moduli spaces have the same dimension as the stacks when g > 1; however, in genus zero the coarse moduli space has dimension zero, and in genus one, it has dimension one.  Examples of low genus moduli spaces  = Genus 0 = Determing the geometry of the moduli space of genus 0 curves can be established using deformation Theory. The number of moduli for a genus 0 curve, e.g. \\\\mathbb{P}^1, is given by the cohomology group > H^1(C,T_C) With Serre duality this cohomology group is isomorphic to > \\\\begin{align} H^1(C,T_C) &\\\\cong H^0(C, \\\\omega_C\\\\otimes T_C^\\\\vee) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\cong > H^0(C, \\\\omega_C^{\\\\otimes 2}) \\\\end{align} for the dualizing sheaf \\\\omega_C. But, using Riemann-Roch shows the degree of the canonical bundle is -2, so the degree of \\\\omega_C^{\\\\otimes 2} is -4, hence there are no global sections, meaning > H^0(C,\\\\omega_C^{\\\\otimes 2}) = 0 showing there are no deformations of genus 0 curves. This proves \\\\mathcal{M}_0 is just a single point, and the only genus 0 curves is given by \\\\mathbb{P}^1. The only technical difficulty is the automorphism group of \\\\mathbb{P}^1 is the algebraic group \\\\text{PGL}(2,\\\\mathbb{Z}), which rigidifies once three points on \\\\mathbb{P}^1 are fixed, so most authors take \\\\mathcal{M}_0 to mean \\\\mathcal{M}_{0,3}. = Genus 1 = The genus 1 case is one of the first well- understood cases of moduli spaces, at least over the complex numbers, because isomorphism classes of elliptic curves are classified by the J-invariant > j: \\\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}_{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{A}^1_\\\\mathbb{C} where \\\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}_{\\\\mathbb{C}}=\\\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}\\\\times_{\\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{Z})} \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}). Topologically, \\\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}_{\\\\mathbb{C}} is just the affine line, but it can be compactified to a stack with underlying topological space \\\\mathbb{P}^1_\\\\mathbb{C} by adding a stable curve at infinity. This is an elliptic curve with a single cusp. The construction of the general case over \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{Z}) was originally completed by Deligne and Rapoport., URL: http://publications.ias.edu/node/367 Note most authors consider the case of genus one curves with one marked point as the origin of the group since otherwise the stabilizer group in a hypothetical moduli space \\\\mathcal{M}_1 would have stabilizer group at the point [C] \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}_1 given by the curve, since elliptic curves have an Abelian group structure. This adds unneeded technical complexity to this hypothetical moduli space. On the other hand, \\\\mathcal{M}_{1,1} is a smooth Deligne‚ÄìMumford stack. = Genus 2 =  Affine parameter space  In genus 2 it is a classical result that all such curves are hyperelliptic,pg 298 so the moduli space can be determined completely from the branch locus of the curve using the Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula. Since an arbitrary genus 2 curve is given by a polynomial of the form :y^2 - x(x-1)(x-a)(x-b)(x-c) for some uniquely defined a,b,c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{A}^1, the parameter space for such curves is given by :\\\\mathbb{A}^3 \\\\setminus (\\\\Delta_{a,b} \\\\cup \\\\Delta_{a,c} \\\\cup \\\\Delta_{b,c}), where \\\\Delta_{i,j} corresponds to the locus i eq j.  Weighted projective space  Using a weighted projective space and the Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula, a hyperelliptic curve can be described as a polynomial of the form :z^2 = ax^6 + bx^5y + cx^4y^2 + dx^3y^3 + ex^2y^4 + fxy^5 + gy^6 , where a,\\\\ldots,f are parameters for sections of \\\\Gamma(\\\\mathbb{P}(3,1), \\\\mathcal{O}(g)). Then, the locus of sections which contain no triple root contains every curve C represented by a point [C]\\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}_2. = Genus 3 = This is the first moduli space of curves which has both a hyperelliptic locus and a non- hyperelliptic locus. The non-hyperelliptic curves are all given by plane curves of degree 4 (using the genus degree formula), which are parameterized by the smooth locus in the Hilbert scheme of hypersurfaces :\\\\mathrm{Hilb}_{\\\\mathbb{P}^2}^{8t-4} \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{P}^{\\\\binom{6}{4} - 1}. Then, the moduli space is stratified by the substacks :\\\\mathcal{M}_3 = [H_2/\\\\mathrm{PGL}(3))] \\\\coprod \\\\mathcal{M}_3^{\\\\mathrm{hyp}}.  Birational geometry  = Unirationality conjecture = In all of the previous cases, the moduli spaces can be found to be unirational, meaning there exists a dominant rational morphism > \\\\mathbb{P}^n --> \\\\mathcal{M}_g and it was long expected this would be true in all genera. In fact, Severi was proved this to be true for genera up to 10. It turns out though for genus g \\\\geq 23 all such moduli spaces are of general type, meaning they are not unirational. They accomplished this by studying the Kodaira dimension of the coarse moduli spaces :\\\\kappa_g = \\\\mathrm{Kod}(\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g}), and found \\\\kappa_g > 0 for g \\\\geq 23. In fact, for g > 23, :\\\\kappa_g = 3g - 3 = \\\\dim(\\\\mathcal{M}_g), and hence \\\\mathcal{M}_g is of general type.  Geometric implication  This is significant geometrically because it implies any linear system on a ruled variety cannot contain the universal curve \\\\mathcal{C}_g.  Stratification of boundary of \\\\mathcal{M}_g The moduli space \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g} has a natural stratification on the boundary \\\\partial\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g} whose points represent singular genus g curves. It decomposes into strata :\\\\partial\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g} = \\\\coprod_{0 \\\\leq h \\\\leq (g/2)} \\\\Delta_h^*, where * \\\\Delta_h^* \\\\cong \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{h} \\\\times \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g-h} for 1 \\\\leq h < g/2. * \\\\Delta_0^* \\\\cong \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g-1,2} / (\\\\Z/2) where the action permutes the two marked points. * \\\\Delta_{g/2} \\\\cong (\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g/2} \\\\times \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g/2}) / (\\\\Z/2) whenever g is even. The curves lying above these loci correspond to * A pair of curves C, C' connected at a double point. * The normalization of a genus g curve at a single double point singularity. * A pair of curves of the same genus connected at a double point up to permutation. = Stratification of \\\\mathcal{M}_2 = For the genus 2 case, there is a stratification given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\partial \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_2 &= \\\\Delta_0^* \\\\coprod \\\\Delta_1^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{1,2}/(\\\\Z/2) \\\\coprod (\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_1\\\\times \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_1)/(\\\\Z/2) \\\\end{align}. Further analysis of these strata can be used to give the generators of the Chow ring A^*(\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_2) proposition 9.1. Moduli of marked curves One can also enrich the problem by considering the moduli stack of genus g nodal curves with n marked points, pairwise distinct and distinct from the nodes. Such marked curves are said to be stable if the subgroup of curve automorphisms which fix the marked points is finite. The resulting moduli stacks of smooth (or stable) genus g curves with n marked points are denoted \\\\mathcal{M}_{g,n} (or \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}), and have dimension 3g-3 + n. A case of particular interest is the moduli stack \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1} of genus 1 curves with one marked point. This is the stack of elliptic curves. Level 1 modular forms are sections of line bundles on this stack, and level N modular forms are sections of line bundles on the stack of elliptic curves with level N structure (roughly a marking of the points of order N). Boundary geometry An important property of the compactified moduli spaces \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} is that their boundary can be described in terms of moduli spaces \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g',n'} for genera g' < g. Given a marked, stable, nodal curve one can associate its dual graph, a graph with vertices labelled by nonnegative integers and allowed to have loops, multiple edges and also numbered half-edges. Here the vertices of the graph correspond to irreducible components of the nodal curve, the labelling of a vertex is the arithmetic genus of the corresponding component, edges correspond to nodes of the curve and the half-edges correspond to the markings. The closure of the locus of curves with a given dual graph in \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} is isomorphic to the stack quotient of a product \\\\prod_v \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g_v,n_v} of compactified moduli spaces of curves by a finite group. In the product the factor corresponding to a vertex v has genus gv taken from the labelling and number of markings n_v equal to the number of outgoing edges and half-edges at v. The total genus g is the sum of the gv plus the number of closed cycles in the graph. Stable curves whose dual graph contains a vertex labelled by g_v=g (hence all other vertices have g_v=0 and the graph is a tree) are called \\"rational tail\\" and their moduli space is denoted \\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\mathrm{r.t.}}_{g,n}. Stable curves whose dual graph is a tree are called \\"compact type\\" (because the Jacobian is compact) and their moduli space is denoted \\\\mathcal{M}^{\\\\mathrm{c.}}_{g,n}.

He was a successful businessman, having developed significant business interests from his relatively humble beginnings. He associated with many of the most influential people of his era, and served in the Victorian Legislative Council for 21 years, including stints as Minister for Works and Health and leader of the Legislative Council. As such, he began the Baillieu family dynasty, several members of which remain prominent figures in public life today. Life and politics Baillieu was born in Queenscliff, Victoria in 1859. He was the second son of James George Baillieu and his wife Emma Lawrence, n√©e Pow, relatively recent immigrants. He was educated at the local state school. He began working as an office boy in the Bank of Victoria at the age of fifteen, and remained with the bank for eleven years. In 1885, he went into partnership with J.D. Munro as auctioneers and estate agents. Two years later, he married Bertha Latham, with whom he would later have three sons and four daughters. The partnership with Munro broke up in 1892 and Baillieu founded his own business as an auctioneer, land agent and finance broker. He made and lost a fortune in the Victorian land boom of the 1890s, but was able to avoid bankruptcy due to a little-known loophole in the insolvency law of the time which was exploited by his solicitor, Theodor Fink. As a result of the loophole, Baillieu was able to clear his debts by paying only a tiny fraction of the sum owed, and was able to escape the stigma of bankruptcy. Despite this hitch, he had developed a reputation as an able and competent financier, and became a director of the Herald and Weekly Times around the turn of the century. In 1901, Baillieu entered politics, standing for and being elected to the Victorian Legislative Council as the member for Northern Province. He was a backbencher for several years, but was promoted to the ministry with the ascension of John Murray as premier, serving as Minister of Public Works and Health. He also served as leader of the Legislative Council until 1917. Baillieu served as an honorary minister in the Murray, Watt and Peacock governments before retiring from politics altogether in 1922. Towards the end of his political career, Baillieu began to take advantage of the need for lead and zinc that had been made clear as a result of World War I. Following up on his involvement in the 1905 founding of Zinc Corporation Ltd. at the Broken Hill Ore Deposit in New South Wales, Baillieu worked with W.S. Robinson and Sir Colin Fraser to reorganise the Broken Hill Associated Smelters at Port Pirie and brought about the formation and development of the Electrolytic Zinc Company in Risdon, Tasmania. As a result of this work, he was awarded (jointly with Robinson) the gold medal of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy. At the time of his retirement in 1930, Baillieu was a director of the Herald and Weekly Times, the Electrolytic Zinc, the Dunlop Rubber Company and Carlton and United Breweries. He was also involved with the prestigious Victoria Golf Club, which he had founded and served as president of for several years. Baillieu died in London, England on 6 February 1936. His own estate at his death was sworn at only sixty-thousand pounds (Australian) although he was reputed to be a millionaire. However, he had made substantial contributions to charity; among other things, he founded the Anzac Hostel in Brighton, Victoria as a home for permanently disabled ex-soldiers. His descendants have become part of one of Melbourne's wealthiest and most prominent families.

Old Testament Wormwood is mentioned seven times in the Hebrew Bible, always with the implication of bitterness. The word wormwood appears several times in the Old Testament, translated from the Hebrew term ◊ú◊¢◊†◊î (la'anah, which means \\"curse\\" in Hebrew). New Testament Wormwood is mentioned only once in the New Testament, in the Book of Revelation: \\"The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many died from the water, because it was made bitter.\\" () The Greek word Apsinthos, which is rendered with the English \\"wormwood\\", is believed to refer to a plant of the genus Artemisia, used metaphorically to mean something with a bitter taste. The English rendering \\"wormwood\\" refers to the dark green oil produced by the plant, which was used to kill intestinal worms. In the Book of Revelation, it refers to the water being turned into wormwood, i.e. made bitter. Interpretations Certain commentators have held that this \\"great star\\" represents one of several important figures in political or ecclesiastical history,Henry, Matthew, Commentary on the Whole Bible Volume VI (Acts to Revelation): Revelation Chap. VIII , Public domain, Library of Congress call no: BS490.H4, at Christian Classics Ethereal Library while other Bible dictionaries and commentaries view the term as a reference to a celestial being. A Dictionary of the Holy Bible states, \\"the star called Wormwood seems to denote a mighty prince, or power of the air, the instrument, in its fall.\\"Rand, W. W. (1859), A Dictionary of the Holy Bible: for general use in the study of the scriptures; with engravings, maps, and tables, Entry: WORM WOOD at Internet Archive =Historicist= Various religious groups and figures, including Seventh-day Adventists and the theologians Matthew Henry and John Gill,Gill, John, Exposition of the Entire Bible, Revelation 8:10 at bible.crosswalk.com regard the verses of Revelation 8 as symbolic references to past events in human history. In the case of Wormwood, some historicist interpreters believe that this figure represents the army of the Huns as led by king Attila, pointing to chronological consistencies between the timeline of prophecy they have accepted and the history of the Huns' campaign in Europe.Nichol, Francis D (1957), The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 7, Revelation, p. 789, Review and Herald Publishing Association, Washington, D.C. Others point to Arius, the emperor Constantine, Origen or the ascetic monk Pelagius, who denied the doctrine of original sin. =Spiritual= The Swedenborgian New Church follows a spiritual interpretation of the star Wormwood based on other passages of scripture which mention gall and wormwood. The star signifies self-derived intelligence which departs from God,Swedenborg, Emanuel. Apocalypse Revealed, 1766 (AR), n. 408 and 151, 952. thus it falls from heaven. For the star to make the waters of rivers and fountains bitter signifies to falsify spiritual truths,AR, n. 410. as waters signify truths derived from the Word.AR, n. 409. In general, the Book of Revelation is seen as a prophecy of the corruption of the Christian churches in the end times which is followed by a New Church, signified by the New Jerusalem.AR, n. 876. =Alternative interpretations= A number of Bible scholars consider the term Wormwood to be a purely symbolic representation of the bitterness that will fill the earth during troubled times, noting that the plant for which Wormwood is named, Artemisia absinthium, or Mugwort, Artemisia vulgaris, is a known Biblical metaphor for things that are unpalatably bitter.Johnson, B.

His life was marked by the romanticism that characterized liberals of the time.  Biography  Zamora was born in C√∫a, Miranda State. His parents were Alejandro Zamora and Paula Correa, modest landowners belonging to the white social class. During the early years of his childhood, he received a basic education, typical of a rural area still disrupted by the struggle for independence from Spain. Later, Zamora moved to Caracas, where he continued his primary school studies, the only formal education he received. However, thanks to the influence of his brother-in-law John Caspers, he received informal political training, influenced by the revolutionary movements in Europe. Zamora completed his education thanks to his friendly relationship with the lawyer Jos√© Manuel Garc√≠a. Zamora learned modern philosophy and the foundations of Roman law, and soon advocated the \\"principles of equality\\" and the need for their implementation in Venezuela. = Military life = In 1849, as a member of Liberal Party, he ran in the elections as a candidate for \\"elector\\" to the canton of Villa de Cura, but his nomination was opposed by conservatives, typically using fraudulent methods that he and all his friends and supporters saw as compulsive and illegal. This was a reflection of the tense situation between Liberals and Conservatives on a national level, in which bloody denouement had the intention to prevent a meeting between Jos√© Antonio P√°ez and Antonio Leocadio Guzman, father of Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco. The meeting of the two leaders was frustrated by spontaneous uprisings of peasants in the central region. Zamora immediately called to \\"make war with the Goths\\" to benefit the poor, while Paez was appointed Chief of the Army. Statue of Ezequiel Zamora, Railway Station, C√∫a Finally, Zamora was up in arms on 7 September 1846 in the town of Guambra. The people who started calling him \\"General of the Sovereign People\\" used essential slogans like \\"land and free men,\\" \\"respect the peasant\\" and \\"disappearance of the Goths.\\" After ridding the victorious actions of the Catfish, the Lions were defeated and captured at the Battle of the Laguna de Piedra on 26 March 1847. Zamora was sentenced to death by the courts of Villa de Cura on 27 July of the same year, but Jos√© Tadeo Monagas cut the sentence down to 10 years in prison. He escaped from the Ottawa Prison on the way to Maracaibo Prison, and found work as a laborer on a farm. The following year, he was pardoned. Sometime later, he joined the liberal army of Jos√© Tadeo Monagas, who fought against the landlords. In 1849, he captured P√°ez and took him, chained, to Caracas. In 1851, he was promoted to colonel. But the defeat of the landowners was temporary, and Zamora was exiled to the Caribbean. In October 1858, the Patriotic Meeting was formed and they began a rebellion against the general Juan Crisostomo Falcon, Zamora's brother in law. = Federal War = On 23 February 1859, as part of the Federal War, he disembarked from Cura√ßao to La Vela de Coro. He was named Chief Operator of the West, and made Coro a federal state (25 February 1859) and organized a provisional government in Venezuela (26 February 1859). On 23 March, he triumphed in the El Palito meeting, from which he planned to move toward the western plains. He took San Felipe on 28 March and reorganized the province as a federal entity with the name Yaracuy. On 10 December 1859, the Battle of Santa In√©s occurred, in which Zamora defeated the Centralist army; this action was considered central to the process of the Federal War and a testimony to Zamora's exceptional qualities as a troop driver. After Santa In√©s, Zamora moved toward the center of the country with 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry, through Barinas and Portuguesa, but before approaching Caracas, he decided to attack the city of San Carlos, whose main square was defended by Major Benito Figueredo, with 700 men. During the preliminary actions for taking the square on 10 January 1860, Zamora was shot in the head, which caused his death. The cause of his death remains a mystery. Some say that the bullet came from his own side, obeying orders from Falc√≥n and Guzm√°n Blanco. His unexpected passing changed the positive direction of the war for the Federalists, and resulted in a loss. For many, he was considered the most important popular leader of 19th-century Venezuela, and his remains rest in the National Pantheon in Caracas. Venezuelan bol√≠var banknote depicting Ezequiel Zamora, 2018  Legacy  In 2001, a new land reform program, under President Hugo Ch√°vez, Mission Zamora, was named after Ezequiel Zamora.

Powers, abilities, and equipment Fred Myers has no superhuman powers, but he has the strength, speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, and endurance of a professional athlete from his days as a baseball player. He can throw small objects with nearly unerring accuracy, and his aim is nearly the peak of what a non-superpowered human can accomplish. Only characters like Bullseye, Hawkeye, and Taskmaster can match his accuracy. Boomerang's most dangerous asset is, naturally, his arsenal of specialized boomerangs designed by Justin Hammer. He has modified and improved on them over the years, but the most common ones are exploding \\"shatterangs\\" (with enough explosive power to destroy an automobile), \\"gasarangs\\" that release large doses of tear gas to disable a target, razor-bladed \\"razorangs\\", sonic blasting \\"screamerangs\\", and whirling \\"bladarangs\\" which cut like buzzsaw blades. Boomerang wears light body armor supplied by Hammer, with a wide variety of hidden pockets and pouches for his smaller, specialized boomerangs, in addition to attachments for securing the seven larger primary boomerangs. Boomerang also has jet boosters in his boots which are controlled by mental command through cybernetic circuitry in the cowl, that allow him to fly through the air at speeds up to , and can be used as an offensive weapon when fired at close range. Boomerang has knowledge of basic street-fighting techniques.

One of the founders of the New Primitivism cultural movement in his homeown of Sarajevo, he was also the lead singer and co-author for one of former Yugoslavia's best known bands, Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje (No Smoking). He co-created and participated in TV shows Top lista nadrealista (The Surrealist Hit Parade) and Slo≈æna braƒáa. During the Bosnian War Nele moved to Belgrade where he formed one of two descendant factions of Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje. That splinter of the band was joined by filmmaker Emir Kusturica, and renamed it The No Smoking Orchestra. Early life Jankoviƒá was born on 11 December 1962, in Sarajevo, SFR Yugoslavia, present day Bosnia and Herzegovina into a middle-class family. His father Srƒëan Jankoviƒá was a linguist and professor of Oriental sciences at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Philosophy. In his youth, Nenad was a mischievous kid with short attention span. Following in his father's footsteps, Jankoviƒá also studied Orientalism at the same school where his father taught. However, as his music and TV career took off, the studies were no longer a priority and he never finished them. He initially took a nom de guerre \\"Dr Nele Karajliƒá\\" as an inside joke. The name was supposed to recall the wartime practice of Partisan conspirators from World War II, who were lionized in state-sponsored movies and television series. The surname Karajliƒá vaguely recalls Bosnian Muslim ancestry, obfuscating his Serbian ancestry, despite the fact that it was entirely fabricated. Other Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje members and friends were similarly and misleadingly nicknamed. \\"It later proved to be useful,\\" he once said, \\"since no one outside our group could really tell which nationality we were when the pre-war ethnic tensions started\\".^Balkan Media Music career =Nele and Sejo ‚Äì the original Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje= As Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje's music and shtick started to catch on all over ex-Yugoslavia during mid-'80s, Nele became one of the better-known public figures in the entire country. His deliberately low-brow and unkempt style were paired with a similar philosophical streak of New Primitivism that the band claimed to follow and propagate. Never content to merely let the music do the talking, Nele often engaged in matters he knew would create a stir. Some of them, like the now-famous 'Marshall episode' (when Nele declared during a concert \\"The Marshall croaked. I mean, the amplifier\\"), seem ridiculously benign and innocuous by today's standards but nevertheless raised a furor in the post-Tito socialist Yugoslavia of the 1980s. Band's pre-show press conferences often assumed the form of a debate club with Nele charming journalists while pontificating on issues ranging from lower league soccer to Karl Marx's Manifesto. It was part publicity tool, part socio-political theatre. As far as on-stage behavior goes, dr Nele Karajliƒá was probably the first Yugo rock frontman to take a truly active approach while in front of a crowd. Fully utilizing the stage equipment, he would climb stage walls, dive into the audience, rip his clothes off, simulate fellatio on microphones, flip crowds off, etc. One particular occasion during 1985/86 tour at Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall in Zagreb (place that usually hosts opera singers and symphony orchestras and hence has a bolted down concert piano on stage) saw him get on top of the said piano, and proceeding to dry hump it for an extended period ‚Äì all of which got him a big cheer from the crowd but also managed to offend many purists. The band started to hit it big fairly quickly. Their debut album Das ist Walter appeared in June 1984 and it was soon apparent that their popularity would soon grow beyond the city of Sarajevo. A national tour followed, which brought Nele more attention. They played a sold- out show (6,000 capacity) at Hala sportova in Belgrade on 4 November 1984. At this time Nele was also starring on the Top lista nadrealista sketch comedy TV show, soon making him a celebrity. His face started popping up on fold-out posters in entertainment magazines and he was talked about by the media. Over the next seven years Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje recorded three more studio albums and played countless sold-out arenas until, in late 1991, Nele and Davor Suƒçiƒá (aka \\"Sejo Sexon\\") decided to go their separate ways. The Nele-Sejo relationship was always the band's nucleus. Having written lyrics and music for most of the songs, the duo was running the band while rest of the group employed a revolving door policy. The circumstances under which Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje ceased to exist in its first incarnation, are not entirely clear. In later interviews, Nele has explicitly stated that Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje disbanded when Sejo informed him about not wanting to play anymore in late 1991 and that it had nothing to do with the war, while Sejo seems to suggest the break-up occurred implicitly when Nele fled for Belgrade in the spring of 1992, soon after fighting flared up in Bosnia. There is no indication they've ever met face to face since then, except after Sejo's father died and they reunited for a night of drinking at a bar. Their already complex working-business friendship-relationship was further burdened by their ethnic background ‚Äì Nele is a Serb while Sejo is identifying himself as a Bosnian, although of Croatian descent. Although never openly hostile in interviews when the topic of old times is broached, both men noticeably try to project an air of indifference about one another. =Dr Karajliƒá goes to Belgrade= In Belgrade, Nele was a refugee ‚Äì albeit a famous one. Together with his wife Sanja and their infant daughter he spent his first Belgrade days in the apartment belonging to Rambo Amadeus. For the most part, music was the furthest thing on his mind during this period. He could be seen across town waiting in lines in front of different charity organizations like ADRA to send food packages to family members in Sarajevo which was under siege by Serbian forces. His first post- original-Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje music gig was a low-publicity duet with Toni Montano on a quickly forgotten track called \\"Sreƒána porodica\\". Throughout the 1993 through 1996 period, Nele played with different musicians on a recreational basis under the name Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje. He did not record any new material and would occasionally play an odd club date or two in Belgrade. In September 1995 he traveled to Toronto where he met up with Mladen Paviƒçiƒá 'Pava', formerly of Plavi Orkestar, and some local musicians, including drummer Boris Daich and bassist Nenad Stanojevic, for a Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje show. During this time he also collected and honed material for a possible new album, although he was not quite sure when or even if he would like to release it. Or, for that matter, if Belgrade audiences still had any interest in a band-less rocker from Sarajevo. The event that finally made him realize he could still be relevant was a concert at Belgrade's Ta≈°majdan stadium which the band booked somewhat pretentiously for 13 September 1996. The place seats around 10,000 and the plan was to play old Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje songs with some unfinished new material sprinkled in throughout. Amazingly, the stadium was packed and the show turned into a comeback triumph for Nele that couldn't be spoiled even by the pouring rain. On the strength of their Belgrade success the new band embarked on a mini-tour across SR Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Slovenia during which they played some memorable arena gigs in Novi Sad, Skopje, Banja Luka and Ljubljana. This sudden unexpected surge of public interest made Nele feel added responsibility for the quality of the material about to be released, so he postponed the already set album release date because he felt songs were still not tight enough. Finally in 1997, the Belgrade fraction of Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje (of which Nele was the only original member) released Ja nisam odavle (I'm not from around 'ere) which did very well commercially in Serbia even if reviews weren't as glowing. In 1998, members of the Belgrade Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje joined forces with Riblja ƒåorba's Bora ƒêorƒëeviƒá under the name Riblje Pu≈°enje (Fish Smoking) to record two Yugoslavia fan songs for the upcoming soccer World Cup in France. Two tracks entitled \\"Pobedniƒçka Pesma\\" (Winners' Song) and \\"Gubitniƒçka Pesma\\" (Losers' Song) featured Nele and Bora singing praises and insults respectively to the SR Yugoslavia national team. The idea was to have a song ready for each case ‚Äì victory and defeat. Around this time Nele collaborated with film director and former Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje bass player, Emir Kusturica, on the soundtrack for the Black Cat, White Cat movie. Off that record, the track \\"Pit bull\\" became a moderate hit as well as \\"Bubamara\\" ‚Äì a gypsy brass version of \\"≈Ωeni nam se Vukota\\" (Vukota's Getting Married) from Ja nisam odavle. =The No Smoking Orchestra= Nele Karajliƒá, the singer of Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra, at the Teatro de Verano in Montevideo, 17 October 2008. Karajliƒá, Sparavalo and Kusturica in Caracas, Venezuela during April 2008. After Black Cat, White Cat finished its theatrical life, Nele and the band were approached by Emir Kusturica for an Italian tour in the summer of 1999, right after the NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia. The idea was obviously to ride the wave of Kusturica's popularity so the band got renamed to Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra even if the famous director had a fairly minor musical role in it. The tour named Effeti Collaterali was a big success and they soon released a Europe-wide album for Universal named Unza Unza Time. This was the third incarnation of Zabranjeno pusenje (second after Nele's split from the original band). They did away with traditional rock'n'roll sound but kept the attitude. Booming guitar took a back seat to accordion and violin, while Nele's scratchy howl assumed a more sedated tone. In the 2001 documentary Super 8 Stories legendary Joe Strummer, clearly at a loss for words, describes their sound as \\"this crazy Greek-Jewish wedding music of the past,... and the future\\". That movie, directed by Kusturica details goings-on throughout their first two tours. A second one that started in the spring of 2000 saw them pay visits to cities in France, Spain, Portugal, Germany and of course Italy, which had by this time become their business base. The band's touring agenda was set around Kusturica's movie schedule (he was shooting Life Is a Miracle at the time), which is why they waited until 2004 for the next tour that in addition to their usual stomping grounds also took them to places as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela and Israel. Even if he does not have the highest billing anymore, Nele is still the band's de facto frontman. Kusturica's role is that of a Trojan horse ‚Äì his starpower draws people to shows, he then does his talking bit at the beginning and in-between some songs (often purposely delivered in broken English) and finally turns the audience over to Nele & Co. Being aware of his limited playing capabilities, Kustarica takes a backseat role as the rhythm guitar player. It is a setup that suits Nele. He and the band would probably never have the opportunity to achieve an international music career on their own and that is why Nele often likens Kusturica's approach and the subsequent band's transformation to \\"someone opening a window in a stuffy room\\". Ironically, this makeover robbed them of huge popularity at home in Serbia. This was most evident on 3 July 2004 when they played their first and so far only domestic show in Belgrade. Conceptually it was to be a celebration of the band's 20th anniversary (if continuity is assumed through all of the band's incarnations) for which they joined forces with another local favourite Riblja ƒåorba, who were celebrating their 25th. The concert drew 40,000 but it quickly turned unpleasant after No Smoking Orchestra took the stage. The crowd coldly tolerated their new shtick (songs in Spanish, German, Romany and English, Nele's new ethno getup, etc.) throughout the first few songs but soon began to show hostility when it became clear the old classics would not be played. Instead of Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje, the crowd got The No Smoking Orchestra, and they did not like it. The stage was pelted with half-filled plastic water bottles forcing the band to abandon their set after barely 40 minutes. It was an unpleasant homecoming and a clear statement that their new style is not welcomed by hardcore fans. The band did not dwell on it and they continued the tour, crossing Europe, South America and even parts of Asia. In May 2005 they played a show in Cannes, France during the film festival for a movie industry crowd including Salma Hayek and Javier Bardem. Writing In June 2014, Karajliƒá's autobiography Fajront u Sarajevu (Last Call in Sarajevo) got released. In addition to glowing reviews and notices, it also did well commercially, selling more than 80,000 copies by the end of 2014. He also wrote FBI-Tesla files, United brothers and Thessaloniki's 28.

It is a branch off of the original format of an hour to an hour and a half of talk and is focused more on short 3‚Äì5 minute comedy skits that usually feature a topic or guest of the previous week's show or news. Topics have included internet phenomena such as 2 Girls 1 Cup and the Cinnamon Challenge, to the inner workings of the main KATG show. Like the show it was inspired by, KATG‚ÄìTV frequently ranks within the top 5 on Podcast Alley. The show has since been merged into the main KATG feed and then further merged into the VIP paywall. In September 2011, Keith and The Girl launched KATG VIP, a paid subscription program that opened up episodes from the back catalog as well as brand new, exclusive forms of content.

History  The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation was born as a result of a highly publicized murder in Greene County, Tennessee, in December 1949. The heinous crime aroused the emotion of citizens throughout the region. In an address to the Tennessee Press Association in January 1951, John M. Jones Sr., publisher of the Greeneville Sun, called for the creation of an unbiased state agency to assist local law enforcement in the investigation of serious crimes. On March 14, 1951, Governor Gordon Browning signed a bill into law establishing the Tennessee Bureau of Criminal Identification as the plainclothes division of the Department of Safety. Following a series of legislative hearings by the Tennessee General Assembly, the organization was re-established on March 27, 1980, as an independent agency and renamed the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.  Overview  The bureau manages the state's three crime labs, assists local law enforcement in investigating major crimes, and conducts special investigations related to illegal drugs, fugitives, public corruption, official misconduct, organized crime, domestic terrorism, healthcare fraud, arson, explosives, and patient abuse. The TBI has statutory responsibility for collecting state crime statistics, which are published in an annual report. It also manages a TBI most wanted list, amber alert program, and statewide registries of sex offenders and methamphetamine offenders. Besides its headquarters in Nashville, the TBI has offices in Chattanooga, Cookeville, Jackson, Johnson City, Knoxville, and Memphis. The bureau is headed by a director appointed by the Governor of Tennessee to a six-year term. The director is also a member of the Tennessee Law Enforcement Planning Commission. Its incumbent director is former Knoxville chief of police, David B. Rausch, appointed in 2018. , the agency employs about 550 people, about half of whom are commissioned officers.  Controversy  Its incumbent director was appointed after previous director Mark Gwyn retired less than two years into his third term, amid controversies regarding nepotism in his hiring practices followed by a scathing audit by the comptroller's office which found he had overspent his budget for four years running. The interim director, Jason Locke, also came under investigation the day David B. Rausch was appointed due to a complaint received from his wife describing misuse of state funds during an affair with another state employee at the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.

Description The pass takes its name from the village Montgen√®vre (Hautes-Alpes), which lies in the vicinity. It links Brian√ßon in the upper Durance valley with the Susa Valley and its communes of Cesana Torinese and Susa in the Metropolitan City of Turin, Piedmont. The Col de Montgen√®vre is an important road connection, and is kept open in winter. Its importance has always lain in the fact that it is the lowest of the principal crossings of the main range of the Alps between France and Italy. History It was known to the Romans before 118 BC, when Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus started construction of the Via Domitia road, which terminated at the pass.Cicero, pro Font. 8 Pompey used it on his campaign to Spain in 77 BC, claiming to have opened up a route more favorable than hitherto. It was subsequently used by Julius Caesar in travelling to Gaul and became thereafter the main route for travel between Roman Italy and southern Gaul or Spain. The Col de Montgen√®vre is considered a possible route for Hannibal's famous passage through the Alps on his journey from the Rhone (in French, Rh√¥ne) river valley to Italy.Hannibal's War: A Military History of the Second Punic War, p. 182,John Francis Lazenby University of Oklahoma Press, 1998 Through this pass Charles VIII of France led his army in September 1494 on his way to capture the Kingdom of Naples, which would spark 65 years of intermittent warfare up and down Italy, later known as the Italian Wars.Francesco Guicciardini, Storia d'Italia, Book 1 chapter 9. Due to the strategic importance of this pass, the lowest over this part of the Alps, several forts have been built, such as Brian√ßon and Fort Janus.

C. Jersild. It was well received as it played into the contemporary fear of nuclear holocaust. P.C. Jersild was an active anti-nuclear campaigner as part of the Nobel Prize-winning NGO, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. Plot summary Jersild used his medical knowledge of the long- term effects of a nuclear holocaust to great effect in this novel, which relates the adventures of a young man dumped on the island of Gotland some 30 years after a worldwide nuclear catastrophe. Humanity is about to go out with a whimper. The only inhabitants of the island are a band of aging convicts and a handful of religious women, also advanced in years, plus a few hermits. The economy is reduced to barter and plunder and the only medical care is provided by an ex-baseball player, who becomes the reluctant mentor of the protagonist. A ray of hope is introduced in the story with the arrival of a young Finnish woman, but it all ends in misery. References * Books - In Short: Fiction, The New York Times review.

History =American Wrestling Association= On August 29, 1982, Santana and Martel teamed up for the first time. They faced AWA Tag Team Champions The High Flyers, Greg Gagne and \\"Jumpin'\\" Jim Brunzell for the title. Martel and Santana came up short after Brunzell pinned Santana. =World Wrestling Federation= The team officially formed on a permanent basis after Martel defeated both members of The Islanders (Haku and Tama) in separate singles matches in July 1987 (after the departure of his then tag team partner Tom Zenk from the WWF, with Zenk's departure worked into the feud and used as fodder by the Islanders to taunt Martel). On the August 15, 1987 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, the Islanders jumped Martel after his win over Barry Horowitz. Santana, who was doing commentary in the Spanish broadcast booth, ran to the ring to help Martel fight off the attackers. The team were played off as good looking pretty boys (a story-line that came directly from the team's predecessor The Can-Am Connection) even using the theme called \\"Girls In Cars\\", which was originally made for the Can-Am Connection. The name Strike Force came from Santana's promise that as a team they would, \\"be striking (the Islanders) with force.\\" Martel immediately came up with the team's name based on this. They feuded with the Islanders until October, when they got a shot at The Hart Foundation for the Tag Team Championship. On October 27, 1987 they won the title when Jim Neidhart submitted to Martel's Boston crab. While feuding with the Harts, they resumed their feud with the Islanders, successfully defending the title against both teams at house shows across the country. The team held onto the title until WrestleMania IV, where they lost the tag team championship to Demolition. Martel had Smash in the Boston Crab, until Ax hit him in the back of the head with Mr. Fuji's cane, while the ref was distracted by a fight between Santana and Fuji. In July 1988, Martel (kayfabe) suffered an injury after taking Demolition's finisher on the floor, splitting up the team for several months. In reality, Martel took an extended leave of absence to help take care of his wife, who was severely ill.Santana, Tito (2008).Tito Santana's Tales From The Ring, pp.81-82, Sports Publishing LLC. Rick Martel, Shoot Interview By RF video Santana wrestled in singles matches again afterwards for a while. Martel returned to the WWF in January 1989 at the Royal Rumble. Sometime later, Santana and Martel reunited, taking on The Brain Busters at WrestleMania V. After Santana accidentally knocked Martel out with a flying forearm, Martel left Santana alone in the ring to fend for himself, thus turning heel. Martel later stated that he felt Santana had been riding his coattails and was sick and tired of carrying him. The two feuded for the next year, as Martel transformed into \\"The Model\\" Rick Martel, an arrogant egomaniac. Both men scored wins over the other, including a win by Santana over Martel in the final of the 1989 King of the Ring tournament. Martel scored a win over Santana later in the year at the Survivor Series when he pinned his former partner as the first elimination of the opening match of the night. The feud between the two effectively died out after the Survivor Series, with the two sporadically facing each other in matches throughout 1990, with their last two televised meetings taking place around Thanksgiving, first being on the opposite sides of the Grand Finale match of the 1990 Survivor Series, where Santana's partners, Hulk Hogan and then-WWF Champion The Ultimate Warrior were the sole survivors, giving Santana's team the victory, and a one on one match aired the next night on the November 23, 1990 (taped October 30) of The Main Event IV, where Martel won by submission.

They have also released a split with Horna (12\\" LP limited to 500 and CD 1000 pieces) and a 3-vinyl set From the Devil's Chalice (limited to 666 copies).

Satanic ideology and influences Behexen adopts to highly satanic lyrics and imagery. Vocalist and lyricist Hoath Torog identifies himself as a satanist. Torog explained in an interview following the release of their album Nightside Emanations, \\"Behexen is a magical tool and channel formed in 1995, which brings the voices of our gods to be heard, and works as an intermediary for their destructive emanations on this world. Our journey has taken nearly twenty years, and has included many phases, but today our temple shines the light of our lord brighter than ever before.\\" Regarding Behexen's influences, Hoath stated very vaguely that everything \\"esoteric and exoteric that surrounds us can inspire us. Books, religions, magic, death, music...All the things that we hear, see and experience can feed our inspiration. I get influences from my own life and experiences amongst the occult. Black magic is a comprehensive part of my life, so it's natural that my inspiration comes from there.\\" Behexen's original name, Lords of the Left Hand, was inspired by a Samhain song title of the same name.

Also known as Les Chakachas or Los Chakachas, they were formed by bandleader Gaston Boogaert, percussion (conga and tumba); Kari Kenton, vocals and maracas; Vic Ingeveldt (a Dutchman from Liege), saxophone; Charlie Lots, trumpet; Christian Marc, piano; Henri Breyre, guitar and backing vocals; and Bill Raymond, bass guitar. All were native to Schaarbeek (a district of Brussels), or nearby Charleroi, Willebroek and Liege.  History  They started out in the late 1950s, and had a Belgian No. 1 in 1958 with \\"Eso es el amor\\", which was sung in Spanish. In 1959 they recorded \\"Rebecca\\" (a.k.a. \\"Rebekka\\"), which was featured seven years later in the film, The Battle of Algiers. In 1962, they crept into the UK Singles Chart for the first time with \\"Twist Twist\\", which reached No. 48. Although they issued numerous recordings, they are best remembered as a one-hit wonder for their hit disco single \\"Jungle Fever\\" from 1971, which sold over one million copies in the United States, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in March 1972. It also reached No. 8 in the US Billboard Hot 100. In the UK it fared less well: despite some airplay soon after release it was later pulled from airplay by the BBC, which took exception to the song's moaning and heavy breathing. It peaked at No. 29. The song was featured in the movie Boogie Nights. It was sampled on the song \\"Put Her in the Buck\\" on the As Nasty as They Wanna Be album by 2 Live Crew, \\"Rock Freak\\" on Natural Ingredients by Luscious Jackson, Ambassador's \\"Honor and Glory\\", Antoinette's \\"I Got an Attitude\\", Beatnuts' \\"Story 2000\\", CEO's \\"Hit Me with the Beat\\", Public Enemy's \\"Cold Lampin' with Flavor\\"; and featured on the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack, being played on fictional radio station Master Sounds 98.3. More recently, Louie Vega used the track as the basis for a remix incorporating new vocals by American poet Ursula Rucker on The Elements of Life (2004). The Chakachas song \\"Yo Soy Cubano\\" from their 1970 album, Jungle Fever, was sampled in the Mighty Dub Katz' song \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\" (\\"Son of Wilmot Mix\\") in 1995. More recently, the 'ah-ring-ting- ting' vocal was sampled as the hook in the 2012 Kendrick Lamar song \\"Backseat Freestyle\\". The song \\"Stories\\" was recently featured on the Grand Theft Auto V's PS4 and Xbox One versions soundtrack. This song was also covered by the band Cake, renamed as \\"Thrills\\" in their album, B-Sides and Rarities.. It was also covered by IZIT (UK vocal/instrumental group) in 1989. The Chakachas also recorded under the name Los Chicles.

As a college student, Sahir was popular for his ghazals and nazms (poetry in Urdu) and empassioned speeches. =Partition= In 1943, Sahir settled in Lahore. There, he completed Talkhiyaan (Bitterness) (1945), his first published work in Urdu. Sahir edited Urdu magazines such as Adab-e-Lateef, Shahkaar, Prithlari, and Savera\\"Biography ‚Äì Sahir Ludhyanvi.\\" Urdu Poetry.com website, Accessed 14 November 2019 and became a member of the Progressive Writers' Association. However, when he made controversial statements promoting communism, a warrant for his arrest was issued by the Government of Pakistan. In 1949, after partition, Sahir fled from Lahore to Delhi. After eight weeks, Sahir moved to Bombay. He later lived in Andheri, a suburb of Mumbai. There, his neighbours included Gulzar, a poet and lyricist and Krishan Chander, an Urdu litterateur. In the 1970s, Sahir built a bungalow which he called Parchaiyaan (Shadows), after one of his works, and lived there till his death. =Personal life= Although there were numerous women in his life, he never married all his life.Pritam A.

An example of this is Amrita Pritam, whose love for Ludhianvi was not equally reciprocated. It has been reported in the news media that Amrita Pritam became so infatuated with Sahir's genius that she would puff at the cigarette butts he had left behind after visiting her. At one time, he was also engaged to Pakistani novelist Hajira Masroor. =Death= On 25 October 1980, at the age of fifty-nine, Sahir died of a sudden cardiac death (heart attack) (he had been a smoker and drinker). He died in the presence of his friend, Javed Akhtar. Sahir Ludhianvi was buried at the Juhu Muslim cemetery. In 2010, his tomb was demolished to make room for new interments.Jaisinghani B. \\"Rafi, Madhubala don't rest in peace here.\\" The Times of India 11 February 2010. Accessed 14 November 2019 Career Sahir's work as a lyricist in the film industry gave him financial stability beyond his earnings as a poet. He made his debut with four songs performed in the film Azadi Ki Raah Par (1949). One of the songs was Badal Rahi Hai Zindagi. Both the film and its songs went unnoticed. However, after Naujawan (1951 film), with music by S.D. Burman, Sahir gained recognition. Sahir's major success was Baazi (1951). Again, the composer was Burman. Sahir was then considered part of Guru Dutt's team. The last film Sahir made with Burman was Pyaasa (1957). In Pyaasa, Guru Dutt played a poet named Vijay. After Pyaasa (1957), Sahir and Burman went separate ways due to artistic and contractual differences.Saran S. \\"Ten Years with Guru Dutt ‚Äì Abrar Alvi‚Äôs Journey.\\" p111-112. Sahir did work with other composers including Ravi, Roshan, Khayyam and Datta Naik. Datta Naik also credited as N. Datta, a Goan, admired Sahir's poetry and their collaboration produced the score for Milaap (1955), Chandrakanta (1956), Saadhna (1958), Dhool Ka Phool (1959). Sahir also worked with music director Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal in the films like \\"Man Ki Aankhe\\", \\"Izzat\\", \\"Dustan\\" and Yash Chopra's \\"Daag\\" all have fabulous songs. From about 1950 until his death, Sahir collaborated with Baldev Raj Chopra (1914 - 2008), a film producer and director. Sahir's last work for Chopra was for Insaaf Ka Tarazu. Yash Chopra, an independent director and producer, also engaged Sahir. In 1958, Sahir wrote the lyrics for Ramesh Saigal's film Phir Subah Hogi, which was based on Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment. The male lead was played by Raj Kapoor. It was presumed that Shankar-Jaikishan would be the composer but Sahir demanded a composer with a more intimate knowledge of the novel. Khayyam composed the film score. The song Woh Subah Kabhi Toh Aayegi with its minimal background music remains popular. Khayyam collaborated with Sahir in many films including Kabhie Kabhie and Trishul. Sahir was a controversial figure in that he was artistically temperamental. He insisted that the film score should be composed for his lyrics and not the other way around. He also insisted on being paid one rupee more than Lata Mangeshkar and this created a rift between them. Sahir promoted his girlfriend, Sudha Malhotra's singing career.Sahir Ludhianvi - Profile on Cineplot.com website Published 22 July 2010, Retrieved 14 November 2019 He also insisted that All India Radio credit film song lyricists.

Instead, he wrote bitter yet sensitive lyrics about the declining values of society; the senselessness of war and politics; and the domination of consumerism over love. His love songs, tinged with sorrow, expressed his realisation that there were other, starker concepts more important than love. Sahir might be called the \\"bard for the underdog\\". Close to his heart were the farmer crushed by debt, the soldier gone to fight someone else's war, the woman forced to sell her body, the youth frustrated by unemployment and the family living on the street for instance. Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India said he was moved by Sahir's lyrics in Pyaasa.

Like Faiz, Sahir gave Urdu poetry an intellectual element that caught the imagination of the youth of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and reflected the feelings of the people of that period. He roused people from an independence-induced smugness. He would pick on the self-appointed custodian of religion, the self-serving politician, the exploitative capitalist, and the war-mongering super-powers. Sahir wrote with verve about the arrest of progressive writers in Pakistan; the launch of the satellite Sputnik and the discovery of Ghalib by a government lusting after minority votes. He wrote Kahat-e-Bangal (The Famine of Bengal) at 25 years of age. Subah-e-Navroz (Dawn of a New Day), mocks the way people celebrate while the poor exist in squalor. Of the Taj mahal, he wrote, :\\"‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•á ‡§Æ‡§π‡§¨‡•Ç‡§¨ ‡§ï‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡§∏‡•á, :‡§¨‡§ú‡§º‡•ç‡§Æ- ‡§è-‡§∂‡§æ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ó‡§º‡§∞‡•Ä‡§¨‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ó‡•Å‡§ú‡§º‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á. :‡§∏‡§¨‡§§ ‡§ú‡§ø‡§® ‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§π‡•à ‡§∏‡§§‡§¨‡§§‡•á ‡§∂‡§æ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§Ç :‡§â‡§∏‡§™‡•á ‡§â‡§≤‡•ç‡§´‡§§ ‡§≠‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ó‡•Å‡§ú‡§º‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á?\\"- Sahir Ludhianvi asks his lover to meet him anywhere else but at the Taj Mahal: although the tomb has been a symbol of luxurious monarchy for years, there is no need for beautiful (but not famous) hearts to travel to meet there. Sahir Ludhianvi recited this poetry couplet at his college event, when he was barely 19 years old, and created an uproar in the literary circles: Ek Shahensha Ne Daulat Ka Sahara Lekar, Hum Gharibon Ki Mohabbat Ka Udaya Hai Mazaq Of his legacy, Sahir writes, :\\"‡§ï‡§≤ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á ‡§®‡§ó‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡§ø‡§≤‡§§‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Å ‡§ö‡•Å‡§®‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•á, :‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡§∏‡•á ‡§¨‡•á‡§π‡§§‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§π‡§®‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•á, :‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§∏‡•á ‡§¨‡•á‡§π‡§§‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•Å‡§®‡§®‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•á; :‡§ï‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§â‡§®‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á, :‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á? :‡§Æ‡§∏‡§∞‡•Ç‡§´ ‡§ú‡§º‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§Å :‡§µ‡§ï‡§º‡•ç‡§§ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡§æ ‡§¨‡§∞‡•ç‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á?\\" :\\"Tomorrow there will be more who will narrate the love poems.

It concerns a married couple's dreams and desires, focusing mostly on the husband's fears of the unknown, of growing old, and of the \\"Other\\" as a threat to his self- identity. Characters *Edward *Flora *a match seller Themes One of the main themes involves one's insecurity about threats to one's self-identity embodied in the character of the matchseller, of whom one of the other two characters, Edward, is utterly terrified. The theme of growing old is also prevalent: according to Edward, the Matchseller is old, practically stone deaf, and has a glass eye, and the middle-aged Edward and Flora continually reminisce about their youth throughout the play. Threat of the \\"Other\\" and obsessive romantic jealousy are also recurrent. Productions A Slight Ache premi√®red as a radio broadcast in 1959, prior to its first stage production. On radio, because the Matchseller does not speak in the play, he appeared to its audience to be a figment of Edward's imagination. The play has subsequently enjoyed a number of successful stage productions. In 2008 it was performed at the National Theatre, starring Simon Russell Beale and Clare Higgins, and directed by Iqbal Khan. The character of the matchseller appeared on the stage, played by Jamie Beamish. External links *A Slight Ache in the \\"Plays\\" section of haroldpinter.org. Accessed October 26, 2007.

Currently the largest shareholders are Canadian pensions group OMERS (23%),https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-thameswater- borealis/borealis-buys-additional-5-5-percent-in-thames-water-from-amp- capital-idUKKBN1AB0SC BT Pension Scheme (13%), the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (9.9%), the China Investment Corporation (8.7%) and the Kuwait Investment Authority (8.5%).https://www.ft.com/content/63ae6f88-08a5-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b The name of the company reflects its role providing water to the drainage basin of the River Thames and not the source of its water, which is taken from a range of rivers and boreholes. In March 2017 a judge imposed a record fine of ¬£20.3m on Thames Water after large leaks of untreated sewage, totalling 1.4bn litres, occurred over a number of years. History =Origins= Thames Water can trace its history back the building of the New River, from 1609 to 1612, which channelled fresh water from Hertfordshire to the New River Head in Islington. The business of the New River was taken over by the New River Company, officially founded by royal charter in 1619, under the leadership of Edmund Colthurst and Hugh Myddelton. Although earlier water companies existed providing fresh water to London, the New River Company is the earliest direct ancestor of Thames Water today. During the 1850s, Dr John Snow and William Farr's identification of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak provided a stimulus to the better treatment of sewage. The Thames Conservancy was established in 1857 with unified control over water supply, drainage and navigation. The Great Stink occurred in 1858, and focussed government and public opinion on cleaning up the Thames. Joseph Bazalgette's remediation of The Great Stink provided the company with much of London's present Victorian sewerage infrastructure and several listed buildings within its portfolio of sites. In 1904 The New River Company and eight other water companies serving London were taken into public ownership under control of the newly-founded Metropolitan Water Board. In 1973 the Metropolitan Water Board and the Thames Conservancy were taken over by the Thames Water Authority, under the terms of the Water Act 1973, along with the following water companies outside the historical boundaries of London:The Thames Water Authority Constitution Order 1973 =Privatisation and listing= In 1989, the responsibility for navigation, regulatory, river and channels management inherited from the Thames Conservancy, was transferred to the National Rivers Authority which later became part of the Environment Agency. The remainder of Thames Water Authority was privatised as Thames Water Utilities Limited. The company became listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Following international expansion, Thames Water became the world's third largest water company in 1995. =Takeovers= Thames Water plc was acquired by the German utility company RWE in 2001. As well as its British operations, it continued as an international water treatment consultancy and acquired further overseas operations. On 17 October 2006, following several years of criticism about failed leakage targets in the UK, RWE announced it would sell Thames Water for ¬£8 billion to Kemble Water Holdings Ltd, a consortium led by the Australian Macquarie Group. In December 2006, the sale of Thames Water's British operation went ahead, with RWE keeping the overseas operations. Under the new ownership, the company re-focused its efforts on improving its operational performance and in 2007 announced the largest-ever capital investment programme (¬£1 billion p.a.) of any UK water company. In 2012 some of the company's stock was acquired by the BT Pension Scheme (13%), the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (9.9%) and the China Investment Corporation (8.7%). Thames Water was a Tier Three sponsor of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. =Recent years= In 2017, under the government's Open Water programme, and in common with all water and sewerage companies, Thames Water must provide entirely separate retail and wholesale operations for its commercial customers, working through a central market operator. On 14 March 2017, Macquarie Group sold its remaining stake in Thames Water's holding company to OMERS and the Kuwait Investment Authority. Finance Littleton , Thames Water provides the second cheapest residential water and sewerage charges of all the combined Water and Sewerage companies. Since 2007, it has made capital investments at least ¬£1 billion a year in its infrastructure ‚Äì the largest such annual investment within the UK water industry. In 2015‚Äì2016, this figure was ¬£1.2 billion. This level of investment has allowed the company to defer, but not avoid, substantial portions of its corporation tax liability in line with UK tax law. Performance Water pumping station at Walton-on-Thames Every day, Thames Water abstracts / extracts, treats and supplies of potable tap water from 100 water treatment works via 288 clean water pumping stations through of managed water mains to 10 million customers (3.6 million properties) across London and the Thames Valley. It maintains 30 raw water reservoirs and 235 underground service reservoirs. As well as direct customers, Thames Water supplies bulk clean water to some inset companies. Other inset companies maintain their own independent means of supply. Likewise, it daily removes, treats and disposes of wastewater from 15 million customers (5.1 million properties) using 2530 sewage pumping stations through of managed sewerage mains to 348 sewage treatment works across an area of of South England. On 1 October 2011, it adopted - an additional 60% - of private sewers and lateral drains to add to its then stock of giving a new network of . By 2015, this figure had grown to managed sewerage mains. Before 1 October 2016, it is obliged to adopt 5,000+ private sewage pumping stations to add to its current stock of 2530 managed sewage pumping stations Again, Thames Water treats and disposes bulk sewage on behalf of some inset companies. Chalk aquifer borehole under the North Downs at Albury Thames Water produces biosolid fertiliser as a by-product from the waste treatment, and supplies this to local farms. It also recovers phosphates ‚Äì an increasingly important source of a dwindling naturally occurring mineral. Sewage Treatment Works at Crossness , it recovered approximately 18 MW (156 GWh per year), or 12.5% of its total energy requirements from renewable electricity generated from biogas collected from the sewage. Further biogas capacity, the burning of 'fatbergs' removed from London's sewers and substantial solar farms have enabled the company to announce a 2015‚Äì16 target of generating 36 MW (318 GWh per annum) or 20% of its total energy requirements from renewable sources, a 2020 target of self-generating 33% of electricity needs, and a commitment to 100% renewable energy eventually. =Health and safety= In December 2014 Thames Water pleaded guilty to a charge under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 after the death at work of one of its workers. It was fined ¬£300,000 with ¬£61,000 prosecution costs. The incident occurred at its Coppermill Water Treatment Works in Walthamstow, London E17 in April 2010 when an excavator reversed over and killed the worker in a slow sand filter. The prosecution followed an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive. =Leakage= 2001‚Äì06 (RWE's ownership) Thames Water was repeatedly criticised for the amount of water that leaked from its pipes by the industry regulator Ofwat and was fined for this. In May 2006 the leakage was nearly per day and in June that year Thames Water missed its target for leakage reduction for the third year in a row. The Consumer Council for Water, a customers' group, accused Thames Water for continuing to miss its targets for the past five years. In July 2006, instead of a fine which would have gone \\"to the exchequer\\", the company was required to spend an extra ¬£150 million on repairs. Since 2007 (Kemble's ownership) Thames Water has hit its Ofwat-agreed annual leakage- reduction target for the past ten years running (2006 to 2016). In 2006‚Äì07, the company stated that it had reduced its daily loss through leaks by to an average of per day. For 2009‚Äì10 the Ofwat-reported daily leakage was . In its price control determination for the period 2010 to 2015, Ofwat did not allow the funds needed to finance a significant further reduction in leakage and used the assumption that daily leakage would be in 2010‚Äì11 and from 2011 to 2012. In 2011‚Äì12, actual daily leakage was ; in 2012‚Äì13, ; in 2013‚Äì14, ; in 2014‚Äì2015, ; in 2015‚Äì2016, . The company has achieved these reductions by: : The recent successes in meeting leakage targets have mitigated the earlier failures to meet targets. As a result, and in spite of a larger distribution network, Thames Water now leaks slightly less water than at privatisation in 1989, having reduced leakage from its network of water pipes by more than a third since its 2004 peak to its current lowest-ever level. and with an older network profile, Thames Water leaked 25.8%2012/13 figures: daily leakage; daily supply of supply, slightly less than Severn Trent at 27%. Thames Water leaked 25.1% of supply.2014‚Äì2015 figures: daily leakage; daily supply In June 2018 regulators made Thames Water pay ¬£65 million to customers among other problems because they failed to fix leaks.Thames Water to pay back ¬£65m to customers as part of penalty package The Guardian =Pollution= In the period 2005‚Äì13 Thames Water was the most heavily fined water company in the UK for pollution incidents, paying ¬£842,500 for 87 events. In 2016, it paid the largest fine for a single pollution incident of ¬£1 million. In March 2017, Thames Water was fined a record ¬£20.3 million after it pumped nearly 1.5 billion litres of untreated sewage into the River Thames. The company also admitted other water pollution and offences in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. In awarding the fine, Judge Francis Sheridan noted the company's \\"continual failure to report incidents\\" and \\"history of non-compliance\\", saying: \\"This is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs. It should not be cheaper to offend than to take appropriate precautions. I have to make the fine sufficiently large that [Thames Water] get the message\\", adding that, \\"One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned.\\". What was \\"shocking and disgraceful\\" was not just the scale of the pollution, but that it was intentional. Sheridan added \\"the constant use of flow clipping to protect the treatment process, so that, despite the regular and prolonged discharge of untreated sewage to the River Thames via the storm outfalls, all samples taken at the final effluent outfall complied with the permit. This was deliberately done and gave a false impression of the sewage treatment works‚Äô performance and undermined the operator‚Äôs self-monitoring process.\\" Conversely, in 2014, Thames Water admitted that it had accidentally over-reported the number of properties at high risk of sewage flooding between 2005 and 2010. It agreed to a compensation package for customers of ¬£86 million. Other incidents Thames Water at work in Muswell Hill, London In September 2007, of the River Wandle, Greater London was polluted. In January 2009, Thames Water pleaded guilty at Sutton Magistrates Court, and was subsequently fined ¬£125,000 at Croydon Crown Court and ordered to pay ¬£21,335 in clean-up and investigation costs.Britain‚Äôs largest water company prosecuted for 5km river pollution , Environment Agency, February 2009; retrieved on 5 February 2009. In February 2010, on appeal, the fine was found to be \\"manifestly excessive\\" and was reduced to ¬£50,000. On 5‚Äì8 June 2011, more than , or 230,000 tonnes, of sewage were released from Mogden Sewage Treatment works, killing 26,000 fish. Between 14 and 16 August 2011, Thames Water polluted the Faringdon Stream, in Faringdon, Oxfordshire. The company was fined ¬£10,000 and ordered to pay costs of ¬£4,488 On 29 October 2011, Thames Water released thousands of tonnes of raw sewage into the River Crane in Greater London, killing thousands of fish, when a six-tonne valve jammed during routine maintenance. Despite tankering and alternative routing, the volume of sewage from Heathrow overwhelmed the operations. Thames Anglers Conservancy's Robin Vernon said: ‚ÄúIt will take a decade to repair all the damage done by the sewage spill. Everything in there is just dead now.‚Äù In 2013, fungus and slime in the River Crane was attributed to runoff of de-icer from Heathrow getting into the river In 2014, Thames Water blamed recent pollution on fat poured down drains by local customers. On 9 December 2011, Thames Water was fined ¬£60,000 after releasing sewage sludge into the Foudry Brook killing up to 20,000 fish in a three-mile stretch from Silchester, Hampshire. In September 2012, clogged-up pumps caused sewage to be released into the Chase Brook, near Newbury. A ¬£250,000 fine imposed in August 2014 was adjudged \\"lenient\\" on appeal in 2015. The pumps were replaced by improved pumps. In January 2016, Thames Water was fined a record ¬£1m for polluting the Grand Union Canal in Hertfordshire between July 2012 and April 2013. In addition, it was required to pay costs of ¬£18,000 and a victim surcharge of ¬£120. In its defence, Thames Water said it had spent ¬£30,000 replacing equipment at Tring. On Christmas Day 2016, the Thames Water Hampton pump failed and as a consequence, thousands of Londoners in the TW and W postcode areas were left without water. In December 2018, Thames Water was fined ¬£2m for polluting two brooks near Milton-under-Wychwood in Oxfordshire. On 8 and 9 August 2015, raw sewage was discharged into the water, killing 150 fish. It was also forced to pay legal costs of ¬£79,991.57. In July 2019, Thames Water was fined ¬£607,000 for polluting the Maidenhead Ditch and the River Cut in Berkshire. In June 2014, raw sewage and treated sewage was discharged into the Maidenhead Ditch. Thames Water has a licence to discharge sewage into the watercourse in storm conditions. However, in June 2014 there were no extreme weather events which would allow the company to discharge untreated sewage. The company also did not meet the conditions which would allow it to discharge treated sewage. Another incident of sewage discharge occurred on 7 August 2014. The company was also ordered to pay costs of ¬£100,000. =Local planning= In 2011, the company found itself involved in a controversial redevelopment plan for the Bath Road Reservoir in its home town of Reading. An appeal against Reading Borough Council's rejection of the plan was dismissed by the planning inspector in January 2011. Full planning permission was subsequently granted on 10 December 2012. =Flooding= The exceptional rain and weather conditions of 2013‚Äì14 caused swollen rivers and several low-lying Thames Water treatment works to be submerged under flood water. In February 2014, the River Ash caused flooding in homes in Staines- upon-Thames. This flooding was exacerbated by a two-day delay by Surrey County Council's 'Gold Control' flood control group in ordering Thames Water to close a sluice gate on a Thames Water aqueduct. Thames Water considered it had been following an existing protocol agreed with Surrey County Council and the Environment Agency. =Sheep= Thames Water maintains commercial flocks of sheep on the borders of several of its reservoirs, which are used as the cheapest way to stop large plants growing and damaging the banks. Thames Tideway scheme Over centuries of London's growth from medieval times to the Victorian age, the natural tributary system of the Thames Tideway was converted first into public open sewers and then closed over into covered sewers which emptied directly into the River Thames. Joseph Bazalgette's remediation of the ensuing 1850s Great Stink renewed much of London's sewerage mains infrastructure during the period 1859 to 1865. However, the new design was not intended to cope with the doubling of London's population over the following 150 years. The concreting of huge amounts of London's green spaces causes substantial rainwater run-off into the drainage and sewerage systems which had been expected to soak into the ground. As a result, even small amounts of rainfall in certain circumstances can cause London's outdated Victorian sewerage system to fail over, and release untreated sewage mixed with rainwater directly into the Thames Tideway. Each year, on average, there are 50‚Äì60 such incidents and a total of , or 39 million tonnes, is released. In 2013‚Äì14, exceptional weather conditions and flooding caused a total release of , or 55 million tonnes. The released effluent follows the ebb and flow of the tidal Thames, and can take up to 3 days to exit the Tideway into the Estuary. For this reason, Thames Water advises against swimming in the Thames Tideway and, by extension, walking in the tidal strand area. Despite this pollution, large marine mammals are increasingly found in the Thames Tideway and Estuary, indicating some level of year-on-year improvement To mitigate and resolve the above problems, the Thames Tideway Scheme proposed a three- stage series of improvements. The first two stages of the improvements were upgrades to 5 sewage treatment works and construction of the Lee Tunnel, formally opened on 28 January 2016. Together, these are expected to result in an annual discharge reduction of 40%. This is equivalent to a reduction of or 16 million tonnes per year, down to about or 23 million tonnes of effluent per year. The third stage is the Thames Tideway Tunnel, which was proposed by the Thames Tideway Strategic Study, including Thames Water, as an effective solution to deal with most of the remaining problem. On 12 September 2014, planning consent was formally approved by the UK Government. On 24 August 2015, the building contracts were awarded for the western section (Ealing to Hammersmith: ¬£416 million, to BAM Nuttall, Morgan Sindall and Balfour Beatty), the central section (Hammersmith to Tower Bridge: ¬£746 million, to Ferrovial Agroman and Laing O'Rourke) and the eastern section (Tower Bridge to Stratford and Greenwich: ¬£605 million, to Costain, Vinci Construction Grands Projets and Bachy Soletanche). On 3 November 2015, Bazalgette Tunnel Ltd received its operating licence from OFWAT, ensuring the start of the project. The necessity for action has added urgency because of imminent water quality fines of up to ¬£1bn by the European Commission on the UK Government.

(1999) \\"The Midwife of Modern Midwifery\\" Salon.com, Brilliant Careers. She helped found the self-sustaining community, The Farm, with her husband Stephen Gaskin in 1971 where she markedly launched her career in midwifery. She is known for the Gaskin Maneuver, has written several books on midwifery and childbirth, and continues to educate society through lectures and conferences and spread her message of natural, old-age inspired, fearless childbirth. Early life and family  = Family = Gaskin was born to an Iowa Protestant family (Methodist on one side, Presbyterian on the other). Her father, Talford Middleton, was raised on a large Iowa farm, which was lost to a bank not long after his father's accidental death in 1926. Her mother, Ruth Stinson Middleton, was a home economics teacher, who taught in various small towns within a forty-mile radius of Marshalltown, Iowa. Both parents were college graduates, who placed great importance on higher education. Her maternal grandparents ran a Presbyterian orphanage in Farmington, Missouri, a small town in the Ozarks. Her grandmother, Ina May Beard Stinson, directed the orphanage for many years after her pastor husband's death. She was an avid member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and a great admirer of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Jane Addams. Gaskin's paternal grandparents were all farmers. Adam Leslie Middleton, her grandfather, traveled and worked with farmers from Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas in cooperative grain marketing, organizing communities, as well as larger outlets in Chicago and other large cities, to establish local cooperative grain elevators. His work as an organizer took him to Canada to work with wheat growers, and to Washington, D. C., on the invitation of the Secretary of Agriculture under President Warren G. Harding, Henry C. Wallace, father of Henry A. Wallace, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äôs Secretary of Agriculture. = Education = After graduating from Marshalltown High School, she attended the University of Iowa and obtained her Bachelor's in English literature. She then joined the Peace Corps for several years and had the opportunity to be an English teacher in Malaysia. After being abroad, she returned to the United States and received her Master's of Arts from Northern Illinois University. = Before The Farm = In the 1960s, Ina May gave birth to her first child in which the physician used forceps. The experience was so unpleasant for her, that she searched for a better way for this to happen. Before The Farm was established, her husband Stephen was leading a speaking tour caravan in 1971. This tour was based on his philosophical seminars in San Francisco. It was for the first time on this tour that she helped a woman in childbirth. This birth was just the first of many on this journey; even Ina May gave birth for the second time. On March 16, as the caravan was traveling through Nebraska, Ina May went into labor. The baby, who they named Christian, was born prematurely by 8 weeks and died the next day. She was not allowed to keep the baby, and law enforcement made her bury the child in Nebraska. Her own personal experiences fueled her interest into midwifery and safe childbirth. The Farm Midwifery Center In 1971 Gaskin, with her husband Stephen, founded a commune called The Farm in Summertown, Tennessee. There, she and the midwives of the Farm created The Farm Midwifery Center, one of the first out-of-hospital birthing centers in the United States.Spiritual Midwifery on the Farm . Mother Earth News. Issue #50, March/April 1978 Family members and friends are commonly in attendance and are encouraged to take an active role in the birth. Gaskin found local family physician, Dr. John Williams, to serve as a mentor for her and other women looking to be midwives in this community. At that time, he had nearly 20 years experience being a physician to old order Amish communities who had at home births, so he was experienced with out-of-hospital childbirth. With his help and guidance, Ina May created The Farm Midwifery Center to what it is today. They provide their services for the women of The Farm, as well as those outside the community. The center offers prenatal care environment accommodations for the childbirth event like apartments, houses, and cabins. =Outcomes= A study of home births assisted by the midwives of The Farm (Durand 1992) looked at the outcomes of 1,707 women who received care in rural Tennessee between 1971 and 1989. These births were compared to outcomes of over 14,000 physician-attended hospital births (including those typically labelled as high risk) in 1980. Comparing perinatal deaths, labor complications, and use of assisted delivery, the study found that \\"under certain circumstances (low risk pregnancies), home births attended by lay midwives can be accomplished as safely as, and with less intervention than, physician-attended hospital deliveries.\\".Durand, Mark A. (1992). The Safety of Home Birth: The Farm Study, American Journal of Public Health, 82:450-452. Significance of her work According to Carol Lorente (1995), the work of Gaskin and the midwives might not have had the impact it did, if it hadn't been for the publication of her book Spiritual Midwifery (1977): :\\"Considered a seminal work, it presented pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding from a fresh, natural and spiritual perspective, rather than the standard clinical viewpoint. In homebirth and midwifery circles, it made her a household name, and a widely respected teacher and writer.\\"Lorente, C.W. (1995). Mother of Midwifery: Ina May Gaskin Hopes to Birth a Local Movement of Midwives. Vegetarian Times, Special Women's Health Issue, July 1995. By the early 1990s, after multiple reprints, Spiritual Midwifery was acknowledged as a \\"classical text on midwifery\\" with a \\"lasting impact\\". Gaskin has been credited with the emergence and popularization of direct-entry midwifery (i.e. not training as a nurse first) in the United States since the early 1970s. Between 1977 and 2000, she published the quarterly magazine Birth Gazette. Ina May‚Äôs Guide to Childbirth, her second book about birth and midwifery, was published by Bantam/Dell in 2003. Her books have been published in several languages, including German, Italian, Hungarian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Japanese. Since the early 1980s, she has been an internationally known speaker on maternity care independently and for the Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA), lecturing throughout the world to midwives, physicians, doulas, expectant parents and health policy-makers. She has spoken at medical and midwifery schools in several countries and at both the Starwood Festival and the WinterStar Symposium, discussing the history and importance of midwifery. She is the founder of the Safe Motherhood Quilt Project, a national effort developed to draw public attention to the current maternal death rates, and to honor those women who have died of pregnancy-related causes during the past twenty years.The Quilt Project . She has appeared in such prominent films as Orgasmic Birth (2009) (directed by Debra Pascali-Bonaro) and The Business of Being Born (2008) (directed by Abby Epstein and produced by Ricki Lake). She also appears in With Women: A Documentary About Women, Midwives and Birth (2006), and she is featured in a 2013 documentary about The Farm called American Commune. The Gaskin Maneuver The Gaskin Maneuver, also called all fours, is a technique to reduce shoulder dystocia, a specific type of obstructed labour which may lead to fetal death. Gaskin introduced it in the U.S. in 1976 after learning it from a Belizean woman who had, in turn, learned the maneuver in Guatemala, where it originated. In this maneuver, the mother supports herself on her hands and knees to resolve shoulder dystocia. Switching to a hands and knees position causes the shape of the pelvis to change, thereby allowing the trapped shoulder to free itself and the baby to be born. Since this maneuver requires a significant movement from the standard lithotomy position, it can be substantially more difficult to perform while under epidural anesthesia, but still possible,Demott, Kathryn. (Nov. 1, 1999). Gaskin Maneuver is Gaining Popularity OB/GYN News. and can be performed by an experienced delivery room team.The All Fours Maneuver for Reducing Shoulder Dystocia During Labor Recognition On June 14, 2008, Gaskin led a workshop called 'A Guide to Natural Childbirth' at the New York Open Center in Manhattan. She served as President of Midwives' Alliance of North America from 1996 to 2002. She received the ASPO/Lamaze Irwin Chabon Award (1997), and the Tennessee Perinatal Association Recognition Award. She was featured in Salon magazine's ‚ÄúBrilliant Careers‚Äù in 1999. In 2003, she was made a Visiting Fellow of Morse College, Yale University.Ina May Gaskin website Ina May was awarded the title \\"Honorary Doctor\\" in recognition of her work demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of midwifery by the Thames Valley University, London, England, on November 24, 2009.Ina May Gaskin website On September 29, 2011, Ina May Gaskin was announced as a co-winner of the 2011 Right Livelihood Award for \\"her whole-life's work teaching and advocating safe, woman-centred childbirth methods that best promote the physical and mental health of mother and child\\".Right Livelihood Gaskin's book Birth Matters: A Midwife's Manifesta was named one of the International Planned Parenthood Federation's Top 6 Books of 2011.

It is the second largest township in the Eastern Cape after Ibhayi near Port Elizabeth and seventeenth largest in South Africa after Vosloorus near Boksburg, Gauteng. The name Mdantsane was derived from a stream that ran from the Nahoon River down to the Buffalo River. Some believe the stream was called Dontsane. Soon after the stream was named, a ‚Äúwhite farm‚Äù which was at the entrance of Mdantsane [now known as Zone 1] was also named after the stream Dontsane or Umdanzani. The township is part of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality in the Eastern Cape. The Mdantsane township is the largest township in the Eastern Cape, by population. It is host to some of the best High Schools that produced some of the famous politicians today such Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, Dali Mpofu, Mandla Makhuphula and Ntombazana Gertrude Botha. Mdantsane is also known as home of boxing with boxing legends such as Happy-Boy Mgxaji, Mzimasi Mnguni, Welcome Ncita and the late light weigh WBC champion Luxolo Galada, promoters such as Siphato Handi, and rugby world champion Makazole Mapimpi from Tsholomnqa. History =Establishment= In the 1940s, living quarters for Africans East London workers were hard to find. The implementation of the Group Areas Act of 1950 further entrenched racial segregation in East London. Unhygienic conditions, overcrowding and riots became matters of concern in Duncan Village, a township which had been created for the African population in the 1940s. The apartheid government recommended that Amalinda, a white suburb not very far from Mdantsane, should be zoned as a black area in 1957. However, the white residents of Amalinda, who wanted the area to be retained as a white zone, strongly opposed this recommendation. In the same year, the East London municipality received an instruction from the apartheid South African government to submit an application for a new township for its African residents. On February 20, the Minister of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development announced that the entire African population of East London was to be moved to a new site called Mdantsane, which was within the boundaries of the Xhosa native reserve under the administration of the Ciskei Territorial Authority which had been set up in 1961. The first houses were built in late 1963 with removals planned for 1964. However, removals and resettlement began in 1963. Mdantsane was formally established in 1963 on a farm called ‚Äú Umdanzani‚Äù and the first 300 residents occupied the new houses. The original inhabitants were people who were forcibly removed from what was known as East Bank in East London. In 1964, approximately 112 000 people from Duncan Village were forcibly moved to the outskirts of Mdantsane township. Mdantsane was recognised as a homeland town under the bantustan of Ciskei in 1966. =Township in independent Ciskei= Ciskei became self-governing in 1972 and then granted nominal independence on 4 December 1981, with Mdantsane becoming one of the homeland's largest townships. To encourage African residents of Duncan Village and East London to relocate to Mdantsane, the apartheid government adopted a number of strategies. The first was to introduce the Regional Decentralisation Programme (RIDP) in the 1960s which saw the establishment of clothing, food, furniture and building accessory factories on the border of East London, particularly in Wilsonia and at Fort Jackson in Mdantsane. These industries provided employment opportunities to the Mdantsane residents. To keep these industries operational, the government offered generous industrial subsidies and incentives. By the end of the 1980s, about 30,000 and 7,500 jobs respectively were available in Wilsonia and Fort Jackson. However, low wages, the rise of trade unions and lack of funding in the early 1990s led to the collapse of these factories. To further create the illusion of Mdantsane as an ideal township for Africans, apartheid government then added social services and facilities such as Rubusana Training College, and the Cecilia Makiwane Hospital, and subsidised road and rail transport. =Egerton Massacre= On 13 July 1983, the Ciskei Transport Corporation (CTC) introduced an 11% (50 cent) bus fare increase on the route between East London and Mdantsane. To discuss the issue of the bus fare increment, a meeting with 1000 people was held in a church hall in Duncan Village on 10 July 1983. A committee of ten workers known as the \\"Committee of Ten\\" was elected to represent the community's interests to the CTC. The Committee of Ten tried to meet CTC management on Monday 11 July. The CTC refused on the grounds that they had already talked to community leaders two months before the increases were announced. A second mass meeting was held on 12 July in Duncan Village. About 3000 people attended. The CTC responses were rejected and a decision was taken to boycott the CTC buses. On 18 July, the bus boycott began. The commuters initially walked to work in large groups, from Mdantsane across the Ciskei border to East London, a distance of about twenty kilometres. On its second day, the boycott attracted over 80% of the bus commuters. The number of police soon increased as reinforcements were brought in, and they became more brutal. To avoid harassment from the police, the commuters began to use the trains. The railway, which formed Ciskei's border with the rest of South Africa, was run by the South African Transport Services and located on the outskirts of Mdantsane. The train fares were marginally lower than the bus fares and provided a space for commuters to discuss issues affecting the community. The train fares increased on 1 August 1983 but the commuters continued to use trains.< Security forces from the Ciskei government set up roadblocks in Mdantsane, and there were reports of commuters being hauled out of taxis and ordered onto buses. On 22 July 1983, five people were shot and wounded by Ciskei security forces at the Fort Jackson railway station. On 30 July, a man was attacked and killed by vigilantes while walking near the Mdantsane stadium. On 3 August, a state of emergency was declared in Mdantsane and a night curfew was imposed. Meetings of more than four people were banned and people were prohibited from walking in groups larger than four. The Ciskei government police and soldiers formed an armed human blockade at the Fort Jackson, Mount Ruth and Ergeton train stations to prevent commuters from catching the train on 4 August 1983. The commuters moved a few paces forward. The police drew their guns and the people stopped. Without warning the police fired into the crowd. 11 people lost their lives and 36 were injured. The soldiers prevented people from going into the hospital's casualty ward to find the dead. The Ciskei government intensified its security measures, arresting 700 people in a week. By the end of August 1983, over 1000 people were in jail. The incident is known as the Egerton Bus Boycott Massacre. To commemorate the day, former South African deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe unveiled the upgraded Egerton Bus Boycott Massacre Memorial in Site in memory of the victims of the massacre on 24 September 2013. Today Mdantsane is divided into eighteen zones which are still expanding, with the newest unit known as Unit P. The zones are named numerically in the chronological order of their establishment. The central market, in N.U.2 (Zone 2) district is called \\"The Hi-way\\". It is named after Qumza Highway, which is the main road that runs through Mdantsane(the near high school is Vulamazibuko high school )from East London city centre to an industrial area at the end, Fort Jackson. Here many informal traders sell their wares on the streets and it is also the location of the main taxi rank. There is also formal trading which is housed in the recently built shopping malls. A pulsating culture in music, arts and poetry continues to thrive in this close-knit township life. Many political stalwarts and veterans also hail from this township, including Thozamile Gqweta, Ntombazana Gertrude Botha, Mlamli Ondala and Bangumzi Sifingo. There is a vibrant social life with youth establishing local street wear examples are Pat Hanise founder of Timeless Apparel, Nkosinathi Sikoti founder of Andikuva Noba Uthini, Lesedi Sikwe founder of SickWear Lifestyle that caters to the local Street wear community in Mdantsane and other youth driven initiatives such as Fundanii Digital Learning Programme, founded by Luthando Gubevu and Sinovuyo Apleni that aims to bring digital learning to schools in the township. However, according to Statistics South Africa, the area still has a very high unemployment rate. It is host to some of the biggest events in the province of the Eastern Cape with most notably the Spring Affair and the Mdantsane Summer Reunion which takes place annually on the first Saturday of September at Man's Buy & Braai and the 27th of Dec at Winter Rose rugby stadium N.U.13 respectively. These two events were founded by a group of friends and entrepreneurs who go by the name Loudnoise Entertainment, these guys are also the people behind the famous Mdantsane Native clothing brand. Mdantsane was the home of several figures from the anti-Apartheid struggle, including Monde Mkunqwana who was imprisoned in 1963 for a supposed attempted assassination against Transkei leader Kaiser Matanzima; the lawyer Louis Mtshizana; ANC activist Matta Don Molteno who was banned by the Apartheid government in 1976; and Mzimkulu \\"Dabana\\" Gwentshe of the National African Youth Organisation (NAYO) who was imprisoned on Robben Island in 1964.Truth Commission - Special Report on TRC Victims After a quarrel with his girlfriend, Bulelani Vukwana shot and killed 11 people and injured a further six in a spree killing on February 9, 2002. He later committed suicide. Cecilia Makiwane Hospital is a 1,724-bed multidisciplinary hospital in Mdantsane. It was named after Cecilia Makiwane, the first black registered nurse in South Africa. Along with Frere Hospital and the East London Mental Health Unit, it forms part of the East London Hospital Complex, which serves a population of almost three million people.  Demographics  The language spoken in Mdantsane is Xhosa, however English or Afrikaans is spoken as a second language by the inhabitants. The majority of Mdantsane's residents subsist below the living wage, according to the government's economic classifications. However, there is a growing middle class in Mdantsane. With the advent of the Mdantsane Urban Renewal initiative this category of residents is set to grow rapidly. MDANTSANE has seen rapid growth of foreign African nationals seeking refuge in the township. These foreigners come under different categories such as war refugees (Mostly from North and East Africa) and Economic refugees from countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, Congo, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique also many from the Middle East countries. The refugees have earned infamous collective identities as they continue to be accused of promoting a fast emerging culture of prostitution, propelling drug syndicates and taking jobs away from locals by agreeing to lower salaries and wages. Entertainment *Knuckle City  Sports  Mdantsane is home to the Sisa Dukashe Stadium, a multi-purpose soccer and rugby stadium. Opened in 1973, Sisa Dukashe Stadium has a capacity of 20 000. The stadium has hosted the SuperSport Rugby Challenge and is also an alternative home ground to the Port Elizabeth Premier Soccer League outfit Chippa United. The stadium hosts a number of boxing tournaments and local music events during the year. Mdantsane is regarded as the boxing mecca of South Africa having produced many boxers who have not only claimed South African but also international titles. Mdantsane was thrust into the boxing spotlight by Nkosana \\"Happyboy\\" Mgxaji when he defeated Durban fighter Moses Mthembu in a non-title fight at Sisa Dukashe Stadium, NU2, Mdantsane on 2 September 1972. Mgxaji went on to win the SA Junior Lightweight title in 1973. Since then Mdantsane has gone on to produce 50 national and 23 international boxing champions including the former IBF super bantamweight champion Vuyani \\"The Beast\\" Bungu, IBF world bantamweight Welcome Ncita, WBO light flyweight champion Masibulele ‚ÄúHawk‚Äù Makepula, former IBF Champion Noni Tenge and Zolani Tete. Mdantsane has not only produced excellent boxers but also award-winning mentors like Balekile Sam and Mzimasi Mnguni. Professor Njabulo Ndebele in his book 'Behind sweaty windows‚Äô describes boxing as a core element in the township's culture. \\"Boxing is a street sport in Mdantsane..All the world champions started boxing from the streets, in the classrooms of Mdantsane‚Äôs school...For the young men boxing is ‚Äúa field we ploughed with no skills and resources...It‚Äôs part of the community culture, and entertainment. It has also given the community of Mdantsane a sense of communal identity.‚Äù In April 2016, South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe donated R1 million worth of gym equipment is to be distributed to 57 clubs in Mdantsane.

The building combines Indian, Creole and Islamic architecture. The Jummah Mosque houses the remains of Jamal Shah (a pir from Kutch, India) in a marble tomb next to the mosque.  History  courtyard of the Mosque In 1852, members of the mercantile community of Port Louis (Joonus Allarakia, Casseem Hemeem, Joosub Satardeenah, Elias Hamode, Abdoollah Essack, Ab doorahim Allanah, Ismael Ibrahim and Omar Yacoob) purchased two properties in Queen Street, Port Louis, for a total of Rs 6,800. The deeds of the purchase, dated October 20, 1852, stipulated, among other things, that the Muslim merchants had made the purchases: =Mosque of the Arabs= A house on one of the properties was temporarily used as a place of worship, while the mosque was being constructed. Ismael Jeewa led the prayers at the temporary prayer house. In 1853, a small mosque was built and consecrated. Bacosse Sobedar, imam of the Camp des Lascars Mosque, outlined the mihrab (prayer niche) of the new mosque, which came to be known for many years as the Mosqu√©e des Arabes (\\"Mosque of the Arabs\\") ‚Äì after its founders, whom the general public mistook for Arabs. The new mosque, which could accommodate some 200 worshippers, was the original Jummah Mosque. =Jummah Mosque= The growing Muslim population in Port-Louis was in need of a larger mosque and so between 1857 and 1877, seven different lots around the mosque, amounting to , were successively bought by Muslim merchants for Rs 134,260 and donated to the mosque. Part of the financing came from a two percent tax on grain trade All but one of the deeds of purchase mentioned that the purchases were made on behalf of the whole Muslim community of Mauritius. In the end, the entire block around the mosque ‚Äîbound by Royal, New Little Mountain (now Joseph Rivi√®re), Queen and Little Mountain (now Jummah Mosque) Streets‚Äî became property of the Muslim community. The expansion works began in 1878 and were overseen by Jackaria Jan Mahomed. Artisans, led by Ishaq Mistry, and building materials were shipped from India, but disease among the workers and shortage of construction supplies delayed the completion until 1895. The enlarged mosque occupied an entire block, save for a small plot of land, which was leased to businesses. The mosque's architecture is a blend of Moorish and Mughal influences. The old former Mosque of the Arabs was incorporated as the main prayer hall in the expanded building, illuminated by glass chandeliers. An Indian almond or badamia tree stands in the middle of the mosque's courtyard and was already present on the two pieces of land that were purchased in 1852. Clergy The imam of the Jummah Mosque is Muhammad Fakii Ali from Kenya. He is also the head of the madrasa (Islamic school), where hifz lessons (memorisation of the Qur'an) are given. The graduation ceremony is held every year on the 27th night of Ramadan, on the occasion of Laylat al- Qadr. The khatib of the Jummah Mosque is Mufti Muhammad Ishaq Qadiri Razvi from Pakistan. Organisation The managing committee is elected on a three- year basis by the members of the Cutchi Maiman Society of Mauritius. After every three years of management, a new committee is voted or renewed. The current mutawalli (president) is Nissar Ahmad Ramtoola.

The incoming particle interacts, producing multiple new particles with lesser energy; each of these then interacts, in the same way, a process that continues until many thousands, millions, or even billions of low-energy particles are produced. These are then stopped in the matter and absorbed.K√∂hn, C., Ebert, U., The structure of ionization showers in air generated by electrons with 1 MeV energy or less, Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. (2014), vol. 23, no. 045001  Types  The start of an electromagnetic shower. There are two basic types of showers. Electromagnetic showers are produced by a particle that interacts primarily or exclusively via the electromagnetic force, usually a photon or electron. Hadronic showers are produced by hadrons (i.e. nucleons and other particles made of quarks), and proceed mostly via the strong nuclear force. =Electromagnetic showers= An electromagnetic shower begins when a high-energy electron, positron or photon enters a material. At high energies (above a few MeV, below which photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are dominant), photons interact with matter primarily via pair production -- that is, they convert into an electron-positron pair, interacting with an atomic nucleus or electron in order to conserve momentum. High-energy electrons and positrons primarily emit photons, a process called bremsstrahlung. These two processes (pair production and bremsstrahlung) continue until photons fall below the pair production threshold, and energy losses of electrons other than bremsstrahlung start to dominate. The characteristic amount of matter traversed for these related interactions is called the radiation length X_0. X_0 is both the mean distance over which a high-energy electron loses all but 1/e of its energy by bremsstrahlung and 7/9 of the mean free path for pair production by a high energy photon. The length of the cascade scales with X_0; the \\"shower depth\\" is approximately determined by the relation :X = X_0 \\\\frac{\\\\ln(E_0/E_\\\\mathrm{c})}{\\\\ln2}, where X_0 is the radiation length of the matter, and E_\\\\mathrm{c} is the critical energy (the critical energy can be defined as the energy in which the bremsstrahlung and ionization rates are equal. A rough estimate is E_\\\\mathrm{c} = 800\\\\,\\\\mathrm{MeV}/(Z+1.2)). The shower depth increases logarithmically with the energy, while the lateral spread of the shower is mainly due to the multiple scattering of the electrons. Up to the shower maximum the shower is contained in a cylinder with radius < 1 radiation length. Beyond that point electrons are increasingly affected by multiple scattering, and the lateral size scales with the Moli√®re radius R_\\\\mathrm{M}. The propagation of the photons in the shower causes deviations from Moli√®re radius scaling. However, roughly 95% of the shower are contained laterally in a cylinder with radius 2R_\\\\mathrm{M}. The mean longitudinal profile of the energy deposition in electromagnetic cascades is reasonably well described by a gamma distribution: :\\\\frac{dE}{dt} = E_0b \\\\frac{(bt)^{a-1}e^{-bt}}{\\\\Gamma(a)} where t=X/X_{0}, E_0 is the initial energy and a and b are parameters to be fitted with Monte Carlo or experimental data. =Hadronic showers= The physical process that cause the propagation of a hadron shower are considerably different from the processes in electromagnetic showers. About half of the incident hadron energy is passed on to additional secondaries. The remainder is consumed in multiparticle production of slow pions and in other processes. The phenomena which determine the development of the hadronic showers are: hadron production, nuclear deexcitation and pion and muon decays. Neutral pions amount, on average to 1/3 of the produced pions and their energy is dissipated in the form of electromagnetic showers. Another important characteristic of the hadronic shower is that it takes longer to develop than the electromagnetic one. This can be seen by comparing the number of particles present versus depth for pion and electron initiated showers. The longitudinal development of hadronic showers scales with the nuclear absorption (or interaction length) :\\\\lambda=\\\\frac{A}{N_A \\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{abs}} The lateral shower development does not scale with Œª. Theoretical analysis A simple model for the cascade theory of electronic showers can be formulated as a set of integro-partial differential equations. Let Œ† (E,x) dE and Œì(E,x) dE be the number of particles and photons with energy between E and E+dE respectively (here x is the distance along the material). Similarly let Œ≥(E,E')dE' be the probability per unit path length for a photon of energy E to produce an electron with energy between E' and E'+dE'. Finally let œÄ(E,E')dE' be the probability per unit path length for an electron of energy E to emit a photon with energy between E' and E'+dE'. The set of integro-differential equations which govern Œ† and Œì are given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d \\\\Pi(E,x)}{dx} &= 2 \\\\int_{E}^{\\\\infty} \\\\Gamma(u,x) \\\\gamma(u,E) du + \\\\int_E^{\\\\infty} \\\\Pi(u,x) \\\\pi(u,u-E) du - \\\\int_0^{E} \\\\Pi(E,x) \\\\pi(E,E-u) du \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{d \\\\Gamma(E,x)}{dx} &= \\\\int_E^{\\\\infty} \\\\Pi(u,x) \\\\pi(u,E)du - \\\\int_0^E \\\\Gamma(E,x) \\\\gamma(E,u)du. \\\\end{align} Œ≥ and œÄ are found in for low energies and in for higher energies.  Examples  Cosmic rays hit earth's atmosphere on a regular basis, and they produce showers as they proceed through the atmosphere. It was from these air showers that the first muons and pions were detected experimentally, and they are used today by a number of experiments as a means of observing ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Some experiments, like Fly's Eye, have observed the visible atmospheric fluorescence produced at the peak intensity of the shower; others, like Haverah Park experiment, have detected the remains of a shower by sampling the energy deposited over a large area on the ground. In particle detectors built at high-energy particle accelerators, a device called a calorimeter records the energy of particles by causing them to produce a shower and then measuring the energy deposited as a result. Many large modern detectors have both an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter, with each designed specially to produce that particular kind of shower and measure the energy of the associated type of particle.

They are pioneers of rock en espa√±ol and one of the most influential rock bands in Mexico. They first made an impact with Mojado, Un poco de sangre, Cocodrilo, Pachuco and Un gran circo, songs that narrate the problems, adventures, and beauty of a society anxious to improve its economic status. Their wardrobe has incorporated elements of the pachuco, an archetypical character represented by Tin T√°n in Mexican cinema. Tin Tan is sampled in one of the group's biggest hits, 1991's Pachuco. The last studio album they recorded was in 2009. Since then, the band has collaborated with other bands, as well as having participated in tribute albums for Jos√© Jos√© and the Tigres del Norte. Their sound incorporates many styles, including ska, rock, and traditional Cuban forms such as the bolero and Cuban Son. Roco, the band's vocalist, dresses in a manner reminiscent of the pachucos. History Neighborhood of Colonia Roma Mexico City, Puebla Street At the end of the 1980s, a movement began called Rock en tu idioma (Rock in Your Language), and a marketing was developed by record labels to draw attention of young people to the new trend, which began in Argentina. Influential bands like Soda Stereo, Los Enanitos Verdes, Virus, Heroes del Silencio, Autob√∫s, and ≈Ωas, the band of Miguel Mateos, were among the pioneers who first played authentic rock music in Spanish. Consequently, Mexican bands began to sprout. Many of these were influenced by groups like The Police, The Cure, Paralamas do Sucesso, and others. The early bands of the movement, Caifanes, Maldita Vecindad, Caf√© Tacuba and Man√° achieved huge sales and great international recognition. La Maldita Vecindad appeared on the music scene with a new style that was unheard of in Mexico at the time. It combined strong elements of ska, rock and traditional Mexican music. This included the attire of Roco, inspired by the pachuco culture represented by Tin Tan, the incorporation of a saxophone, and a celebration of the street culture of Mexico City. From 1986 to 1988, the band participated actively in popular movements like the one for the victims by the earthquake of 1985 and the elections of 1988. Their second album El circo turned them into a commercial success. The album reached over 800,000 copies sold (a record high at the time). In 1991, on their first U.S. tour, they played with groups like INXS, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Sonic Youth, Madness, Faith No More and Jane's Addiction. By 1992, they were often compared to other great Latin American bands like Mano Negra and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. Throughout their career, La Maldita Vecindad has remained a creative force. It has also managed to create unique covers of songs by artists from strikingly different genres, like Los Tigres del Norte, Armando Manzanero and Juan Gabriel. Their newest album, Circular colectivo, (Nacional Records 2010) maintains much of the ska/punk energy, with a contemporary sound. The lyrics talk about the crisis that Mexican society faces in a rapidly changing global economy and pays tribute to Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Ernest Ranglin. The production by San Francisco-based Greg Landau (Susana Baca, Patato Valdez, Quetzal) and Hector \\"Hecdog\\" Perez, has helped the band to craft a new path in Mexican music. The album features two cameos by Cuban pianist Omar Sosa. The name In Mexico City, vecindad (literally meaning \\"neighborhood\\") refers to residential constructions that were built at the end of the nineteenth and at the beginning of the twentieth centuries. Still inhabited today, these residential areas share one or more large patios and common areas such as bathrooms and laundry facilities, basically because the rented rooms do not have them. The more patios a vecindad has, the more populated these buildings are and therefore the poorer it tends to be. The name \\"and the children of the fifth patio\\" indicates the urban and working origins of the band.

Simpson attended Aberdeen Grammar School as a contemporary of Byron, who lived nearby in Broadgate. At 13 he entered Marischal College but left after a year, on the death of his father, to work in the office of James Massie, a builder at Castlehill, having been influenced so by his uncle William Dauney. Due to being born lame in his left arm, his father left him a legacy of ¬£200 with which at the age of 20 he went to London to be apprenticed to architect Robert Lugar and later David Laing. After two years Simpson left to embark on a study tour of Italy, returning to Aberdeen in 1813 to start an architectural practice in his old house at 15 Guestrow.Miller, David G., Dip. Arch. (2006) Archibald Simpson Architect: His Life and Times, 1790‚Äì1847, Librario =Architectural practice= Simpson first established his practice in 1813 at his old childhood home at 15 Guestrow. He later moved to premises at 130 Union Street, where in 1826 he lost his entire archive of drawings in a fire which destroyed the building, forcing him to move his office to 8 Belmont Street and later to 22 Crown Street - where the former Post Office building now stands - before later moving to live at 15 Bon Accord Street and practicing from his office at 1 Bon Accord Street. St. Andrew's Chapel, now St. Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen (1817) The grave of Archibald Simpson, Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen Bon Accord Crescent, Aberdeen (1823) for the Tailor Incorporation The Athenaeum, Aberdeen (1823) Ceres by James Giles, now a pub called The Archibald Simpson Ceres by James Giles, North of Scotland Bank, Aberdeen (1844) Simpson began his work at a time when wealthy country landowners were very influential in the social and cultural development of the City of Aberdeen, church and institutional expansion was rife and the enterprising Incorporated Trades were looking to invest heavily and speculatively in the new civic development - made possible by the bold construction of Union Street westwards across the Denburn towards the rich hinterland in 1801. Simpson, along with his brother Alexander, was responsible for reviving the Aberdeen Musical Society, founded in 1747, in a move to make influential social contacts which were vital to the success of his architectural practice. Archibald played the violin and his brother Alexander played the flute. He later also founded the Aberdeen Artists Society with his friend and collaborator, the artist James Giles, who also undertook several portraits of Simpson for the University Court. James Matthews was articled to Simpson in 1834. =Architectural style= The boldest and most refined architecture of Simpson is in the Grecian style, in its classic purity of detail and proportion, although he was equally at ease in adopting Gothic, Italian Renaissance, Tudor and Hanseatic architectural styles to meet the preference of his clients or the nature of the site. Clients frequently placed him in open competition with John Smith, though they greatly respected one another's work and ambition to achieve civic unity in the new streets that were then under construction. The result was a fine granite street architecture that was to influence the quality of development for a further century. =Death and legacy= Simpson died, aged 56, at his house at 1 East Craibstone Street, Aberdeen on 23 March 1847, having returned ill from a business trip to Derby. He is buried in the graveyard of the Kirk of St Nicholas on Union Street. The grave lies to the south of the church. The Aberdeen Civic Society erected a granite memorial to him in the gardens of Bon Accord Square, as part of the European Architectural Heritage Year in 1975.Aberdeen Civic Society, (1978) Archibald Simpson : architect of Aberdeen 1790-1847 , Aberdeen : Aberdeen Civic Society The city has a Wetherspoon pub to honour his memory.

She was born in London. Life and career Mannin's father, Robert Mannin (d. 1948) was a member of the Socialist League who passed his left-wing beliefs on to his daughter.Ethel Mannin, This was a man: some memories of Robert Mannin. London, Jarrolds 1952. (pp. 24‚Äì25) Mannin later stated that: \\"His socialism went a great deal deeper than any politics or party policy; it was the authentic socialism of the Early Christians, the true communism of 'all things in common' utterly-and tragically-remote from Stalinism\\". When at boarding school, following the outbreak of World War One, Mannin was asked to write an essay on \\"Patriotism\\". Hoping to impress her favourite teacher (a Communist sympathiser) Mannin's essay was an advocacy of anti-patriotic and anti-monarchist ideas. For writing the essay, Mannin's headmistress scolded her in front of the whole school and made her kneel in the school hall all afternoon. Mannin often mentioned this incident in her autobiographies as shaping her later politics.Andy Croft, \\"Ethel Mannin: The Red Rose of Love and the Red Flower of Liberty\\" in Angela Ingram and Daphne Patai, (ed.),Rediscovering Forgotten Radicals : British Women Writers, 1889-1939.Chapel Hill : University of North Carolina Press, 1993. (p. 205-225). Her writing career began in copy-writing and journalism. She became a prolific author, and also politically and socially concerned. Mannin's memoir of the 1920s, Confessions and Impressions sold widely and was one of the first Penguin paperbacks.\\"Writer, Pacifist Mannin Dies\\". The Montreal Gazette, 10 December 1984. She initially supported the Labour Party but became disillusioned in the 1930s. Initially sympathetic to the Soviet Union, a 1936 visit there left her disillusioned with Stalinism, which she described in her book South to Samarkand.Twentieth century authors, a biographical dictionary of modern literature, edited by Stanley J. Kunitz and Howard Haycraft; (Third Edition). New York, The H.W. Wilson Company, 1950 (pp. 905‚Äì6) According to R. F. Foster Roy Foster, W. B. Yeats - A Life, II: The Arch-Poet 1915-1939. Oxford, 2003, (pp. 504, 510‚Äì512). \\"She was a member of the Independent Labour Party, and her ideology in the 1930s tended to anarcho-syndicalism rather than hardline Communism, but she was emphatically and vociferously left-wing\\". She came to support anarchism, and wrote about the Russian-born, American anarchist Emma Goldman, a colleague in the Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista at the time of the Spanish Civil War. Mannin was actively involved in anti-imperialist activity on behalf of African nations during the 1930s, and befriended George Padmore, C.L.R. James and Chris Braithwaite who were leading figures involved in these movements.Susan Dabney Pennybacker, From Scottsboro to Munich: Race and Political Culture in 1930s Britain. Princeton University Press, 2009 , (pp. 93‚Äì4). Mannin was actively involved in anti-fascist movements, including the Women's World Committee Against War and Fascism.Angela Jackson, British women and the Spanish Civil War. London ; New York : Routledge, 2002. (p.250) Mannin supported the military actions of the Spanish Republic, but opposed the Second World War.Martin Ceadel, Pacifism in Britain, 1914-1945: the defining of a faith . Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980. (p. 229) Mannin listed Bart de Ligt and A. S. Neill as thinkers who influenced her ideas. She described W. Somerset Maugham and Aldous Huxley as the writers she most admired, called Norman Haire the \\"one completely rational person she had ever met\\", p. 415 quoting Confessions and Impressions (1930), pp. 191, 194. and stated her \\"opposition to capital punishment, orthodox education and blood sports\\". Mannin's 1944 book Bread and Roses: A Utopian Survey and Blue- Print has been described by historian Robert Graham as setting forth \\"an ecological vision in opposition to the prevailing and destructive industrial organization of society\\".Robert Graham, Anarchism Volume Two: The Anarchist Current (1939-2006). Black Rose Books, 2009 , (pp. 72‚Äì5). In 1954, Mannin was one of several signatories to a letter protesting against mass executions of Kenyans by the colonial government who had been \\"charged with offences less than murder\\".\\"Hanging in Kenya\\", Tribune Magazine, 24 December 1954. Other signatories of the letter included Bertrand Russell, Lord Boyd Orr, H. N. Brailsford, Canon Charles E. Raven, Canon John Collins, Benn Levy, Reginald Reynolds, Lord Stansgate, Augustus John, Monica Whately, and Victor Gollancz. In her seventies, Mannin still described herself as an anti-monarchist \\"Republican\\" and a \\"Tolstoyan anarchist\\". She married twice: in 1919, a short- lived relationship from which she gained one daughter, Jean Porteous, a conscientious objector in WW2, for whom she gave evidence at a Tribunal;Daily Mirror, 16 May 1942 and in 1938 to Reginald Reynolds, a Quaker and go-between in India between Mahatma Gandhi and the British authorities. In 1934-5 she was in an intense but problematic intellectual, emotional and physical relationship with W. B. Yeats, who was on the rebound from Margot Ruddock and about to fall for Dorothy Wellesley (a detailed account is in R. F. Foster's life of Yeats, concluding mainly that her emotional engagement was much less than his). She also had a well-publicised affair with Bertrand Russell.

Early life and family Abdool Razack Mohamed was born in a wealthy mercantile Memon family in Calcutta, British India in 1906. His father Khan Bahadur Hadji Zackariah Mohamed was involved in the import and export trade of sugar. Abdool Razack migrated to Mauritius where he arrived on 16 November 1928 at the age of 22. He returned to Calcutta where he married Mariam before returning to Mauritius. Mariam gave birth to 4 children (Amina, Zackariah who died at the age of 3, Zohra and Salma. In 1932 Abdool Razack married a Creole named Ghislaine Ducasse whom he had met at dance lessons. Ghislaine changed her name to Zainab and gave birth to 6 children (Yousuf, Fatma, Abdul Rahim, Aisha, Abdul Rashid and Isma√´l). Before his entry into politics he became a well known businessman and trader in Quatre Bornes. One of his daughters was Aamna Ebrahim who married in Calcutta, India. Her sons Nasser Ebrahim and Yaqub Ebrahim now live in Calcutta. Abdool Razack's son Yousuf Abdul Razack Mohamed is a lawyer who was a elected for one term (1976 to 1979) to the National Assembly where he served as minister. Yousuf was also Ambassador in Egypt. Abdool Razack's grandson Shakeel Mohamed is also a lawyer who has been MP who served as minister from 2010 to 2014. Abdool Razack Mohamed died in Rose Hill on 8 May 1978.L'express Newspaper www.lexpress.mu Political career During a business trip to Colombia Abdool Razack met Maulana Abdul Aleem Siddiqui whom he invited to Mauritius in 1938. By 1939 Maulana Siddiqui had migrated to Mauritius and he advised Abdool Razack to get involved in local politics. His initial entry in politics in 1940 was not successful. But in 1946 Abdool Razack Mohamed was elected as a municipal councillor of Port Louis as an independent. He was then elected as Lord Mayor of Port Louis in 1949, 1953 and 1956.L'express Newspaper www.lexpress.mu In the early 1940s he championed the cause of all Indo-Mauritians both Muslims and Hindus as most of them were not allowed to vote until 1948. At the 1945 consultative committee for the revision of the Constitution set up by governor Donald Mackenzie-Kennedy he proposed a new electoral system which would allocate at least 50% of the seats in the Council of Government to the Indo- Mauritians. The Constitution of 1882 was still in force and made it almost impossible for any Indo-Mauritian to be elected by votes. Although he was a candidate at the 1948 elections he was not elected in the electoral district of Port Louis. However by the 1950s Abdool Razack switched his allegiance away from the Labour Party and joined the bandwagon of the new Ralliement Mauricien which was formed in 1953 by Jules Koenig. In one of his public meetings he explained that minorities such as Muslims would be better protected from the growing threat of Hindu hegemony especially with the impending constitutional changes. Given that Ralliement Mauricien was claiming to be a national roadblock to prevent minorities from being swamped away, Mohamed devoted himself entirely to Jules Koenig's cause. Using the Ralliement Mauricien's platform Abdool Razack attacked the Labour Party and especially its emerging leader Dr. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. Mohamed openly accused Ramgoolam of supporting Hindu nationalists. At a 1955 public meeting he warned that Muslims would not be used as a stepping stone to further other politicians' objectives especially on the growing issue of independence from colonial England. The local press reported that Mohamed believed that \\"Muslims do not want an independence whereby we will all be dominated by Ramgoolam\\". He was nominated for the first time to the Legislative Council in 1953 as a member of the party \\"Ralliement Mauricien\\" of Jules Koenig in the electoral district of Port Louis as fourth member, and where 3 Labour Party candidates (Guy Rozemont, Renganaden Seeneevassen and Edgar Millien) had been elected with the highest number of votes. However Abdool Razack quickly came to realise that he was not welcome even within Koenig's Union Mauricienne, epitomised by an incident whereby the party endorsed his rival and colleague Alex Bhujoharry's protest for a recount of votes after Mohamed was elected ahead of Bhujoharry by one vote in Port-Louis. This was soon followed by the white lobby to oust him from the Executive Committee of Koenig's Union Mauricienne as well as the denial of a nomineeship in the Executive Council. The white Franco-Mauritian elite chose Osman instead of Mohamed. Finally Koenig's party rejected Abdool Razack's request for a separate electoral roll and reserved seats for Muslims. In 1953 the Union Mauricienne rebranded itself as Ralliement Mauricien and a few months later it was changed to Parti Mauricien which Gaetan Duval later changed to PMSD. Although Mohamed had already decided to quit politics a series of letters written by groups of Muslims appeared in the press to urge him to return to his past ally the Labour party. But Mohamed refused to do so directly given that he believed that Labour Party members were dishonest and because he refused to work with his arch-rival Edgar Millien whom he had described as an opportunist. Thus in 1959 Abdool Razack Mohamed founded his own party called Comit√© d'Action Musulman (CAM). Soon afterwards the CAM contracted an alliance with the Labour Party. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam even attended the first meeting of the new CAM which was held in February 1959 at Plaine Verte. Within the Labour Party the alliance was well accepted as Edgar Millien had started to distance himself from the Labour Party. Besides Renganaden Seeneevassen and Guy Rozemont had already died. Earlier in 1956 Seeneevassen had successfully lobbied the government to instigate the Keith- Lucas commission to investigate allegations of fraud during the Mohamed's tenure as Lord Mayor in 1953. Indeed there had been serious allegations of fraud during the 1953 municipal elections in Port-Louis which resulted in Abdool Razack's election to office. Despite the CAM's alliance with the Labour Party Mohamed persisted with his demand for a separate electoral roll and reserved seats for the Muslims. His approach had been shaped by the All India Muslim League's strategy of the 1950s which successfully weakened the rising Indian nationalism. Mohamed's approach had the unexpected outcome of arousing communal passions within other communities as other politicians decided to adopt Abdool Razack's communal partitioning approach. The 1957 London Agreement split the Indo-Mauritians into 2 distinct communities: Indo- Mauritian Hindus and Indo-Mauritian Muslims. The Indo-Mauritian Muslim community was thus recognised as distinct section of the population. The Trustram Eve's Electoral Boundary Commission (EBC) introduced a new electoral system and a re-zoning of constituencies in 1959. The EBC facilitated the election of Muslims in some constituencies without having to rely on other communities anymore. Trustam Eve thus enabled Mohamed to position himself as the leader of the Muslim community. As a result during the 1959 general elections 5 Muslims were elected and Abdool Razack received the credit for this achievement. He had earlier made history by becoming the first ever Muslim to be elected to Legislative Council at the 1953 elections. In 1959 he was appointed to his first ministerial position (Minister of Housing). Following the 1960 visit by Secretary of State Ian Macleod to the island of Mauritius Abdool Razack became aware of the inevitability of independence. Thus changes in the Constitution and electoral system were bound to occur and would once again affect Muslims' representation. The 1965 Constitutional Conference Report outlined the positions of the parties present at Lancaster House and stated that the only 2 parties advocating immediate independence were the Labour Party and Sookdeo Bissoondoyal's Independent Forward Bloc (IFB). The Secretary of State Anthony Greenwood declared that Mauritius had reached the ultimate status for independence and that the 1963 general elections had already been an indicator of the overwhelming support of independence given that when combined the Labour Party and the IFB gathered 61.5 % of the votes. The report did not give weight to the indecisiveness of the CAM on the issue of independence. The CAM gathered politician J. Ah Chuen's support to ensure that the Secretary of State developed a formula for safeguarding the interests of minority groups in the Legislative Assembly. This formula became known as the \\"Best Loser\\" system which has now survived for several decades. The CAM became part of the coalition called Independence Party which held office after the August 1967 elections in preparation for independence from Great Britain in March 1968 despite the deadly January 1968 Mauritian riots and State of Emergency. The Independence Party consisted of the 3 main parties Parti Travailliste (PTr), Independent Forward Bloc (IFB) and the CAM. This coalition campaigned against the PMSD and a few other minor parties which were opposed to the concept of an independent Mauritius.

It exists in two versions, both by Caravaggio, the first from c. 1594 (now in the Musei Capitolini in Rome), the second from c. 1595 (which is in the Louvre museum, Paris). The dates in both cases are disputed. Subject matter The painting shows a foppishly-dressed boy (in the second version the model is believed to be Caravaggio's companion, the Sicilian painter Mario Minniti), having his palm read by a gypsy girl. The boy looks pleased as he gazes into her face, and she returns his gaze. Close inspection of the painting reveals what the young man has failed to notice: the girl is removing his ring as she gently strokes his hand. Fortune teller's deceit used as metaphor for Caravaggio's seductive illusionism Caravaggio's painting, of which two versions exist, shows a well-groomed, vain young man having his palm read by a gypsy. The wily gypsy woman is guilty of deceit, however: her seductive smile is false, and because the young man has been charmed off his feet by her beauty, he does not notice that she has meanwhile slipped the ring from his finger.G. Mancini, Considerazioni sulla pittura, [1617‚Äì1621], I, ed. A. Marucchi, Rome 1956, p. 109: \`la zingaretta mostra la sua furbaria con un riso finto nel levar l'anello al giovanotto, et questo la sua semplicit√† et affetto di libidine verso la vaghezza della zingara che le d√† la ventura et le leva l'anello'. In 1603 the poet Gaspare Murtola dedicated a madrigal to Caravaggio's Fortune Teller, in which he compares the deceit of the sensuous gypsy with the illusionistic manner of Caravaggio, therefore implying that the viewer, like the young man, is the victim of duplicity.Z. Kwak, ‚Äò‚ÄòTaste the Fare and Chew it with Your Eyes‚Äô: a Painting by Pieter Pietersz and the Amusing Deceit in 16th- and 17th-Century Dutch and Flemish Kitchen Scenes‚Äô, in T. van Houdt, J.L. de Jong, Z. Kwak, M. Spies, M. van Vaeck (eds.), On the Edge of Truth and Honesty. Principles and Strategies of Fraud and Deceit in the Early Modern Period, Intersections.

Een interpretatie van Caravaggio's Waarzegster', unpublished M.A. thesis, Leiden University 1996. The madrigal is addressed to Caravaggio himself: \`Non so qual sia pi√π maga / O la donna, che fingi, / O tu che la dipingi. / Di rapir quella √® vaga / Coi dolci incanti suoi / Il core e ‚Äôl sangue a noi. Tu dipinta, che appare / Fai, che viva si veda. Fai, che viva, e spirante altri / la creda.' L. Salerno,‚ÄòPoesia e simboli nel Caravaggio‚Äô, in Palatino, X, 2 (1966), p. 109. (I don't know who is the greater sorcerer / The woman you portray / Or you who paint her. Through sweetest incantation / She doth desire to steal / Our very heart and blood. Thou wouldst in thy portrayal / Her living, breathing image / For others reproduce, That they too may believe it.) Style Caravaggio's biographer Giovanni Pietro Bellori relates that the artist picked the gypsy girl out from passers-by on the street in order to demonstrate that he had no need to copy the works of the masters from antiquity: :\\"When he was shown the most famous statues of Phidias and Glykon in order that he might use them as models, his only answer was to point towards a crowd of people saying that nature had given him an abundance of masters.\\" This passage is often used to demonstrate that the classically trained Mannerist artists of Caravaggio's day disapproved of Caravaggio's insistence on painting from life instead of from copies and drawings made from older masterpieces. However, Bellori ends by saying, \\"and in these two half- figures [Caravaggio] translated reality so purely that it came to confirm what he said.\\" The story is probably apocryphal ‚Äì Bellori was writing more than half a century after Caravaggio's death, and it doesn't appear in Mancini's or in Giovanni Baglione, the two contemporary biographers who had known him ‚Äì but it does indicate the essence of Caravaggio's revolutionary impact on his contemporaries ‚Äì beginning with The Fortune Teller ‚Äì which was to replace the Renaissance theory of art as a didactic fiction with art as the representation of real life. Second version The 1594 Fortune Teller aroused considerable interest among younger artists and the more avant garde collectors of Rome, but, according to Mancini, Caravaggio's poverty forced him to sell it for the low sum of eight scudi. It entered the collection of a wealthy banker and connoisseur, the Marchese Vincente Giustiniani, who became an important patron of the artist. Giustiniani's friend, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, purchased the companion piece, Cardsharps, in 1595, and at some point in that year Caravaggio entered the Cardinal's household. For Del Monte, Caravaggio painted a second version of The Fortune Teller, copied from the Giustiniani but with certain changes. The undifferentiated background of the 1594 version becomes a real wall broken by the shadows of a half-drawn curtain and a window sash, and the figures more completely fill the space and defining it in three dimensions. The light is more radiant, and the cloth of the boy's doublet and the girl's sleeves more finely textured. The dupe becomes more childlike and more innocently vulnerable, the girl less wary-looking, leaning in towards him, more in command of the situation. Genre The Fortune Teller is one of two known genre pieces painted by Caravaggio in the year 1594, the other being Cardsharps. The Fortune Teller is believed to be the earlier of the two, and dates from the period during which the artist had recently left the workshop of the Giuseppe Cesari to make his own way selling paintings through the dealer Costantino. The subject of the painting was not unprecedented. In his Lives of the Artists, Giorgio Vasari notes that one of Franciabigio's followers, his brother Agnolo, painted a sign for a perfumer's shop \\"containing a gipsy woman telling the fortune of a lady in a very graceful manner\\".This parallel was suggested by Prof. David Ekserdjian on the BBC Radio 4 discussion programme In Our Time, episode \\"Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artist\\" (27 May 2010, circa 37 minutes in). Quote: \\"That's an amazing reference! Because, OK, it's an inn sign rather than a formal painting, but this is someone doing a Caravaggio subject decades and decades before Caravaggio.\\"  References  External links *A Caravaggio Rediscovered, The Lute Player, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on this painting (see cat. no. 1) Category:Paintings by Caravaggio Category:1590s paintings Category:Paintings of the Louvre by Italian artists Category:Capitoline Museums collection ","title":"The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)"},{"id":"3010427","text":"The Lute Player is a composition by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio. It used to exist in two versions, one in the Wildenstein Collection and another in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg. However, a third from Badminton House, Gloucestershire, came to light in 2007.  Background  Caravaggio's early biographer Giovanni Baglione gives the following description of a piece done by the artist for his patron Cardinal Francesco Del Monte: > E dipinse [per il Cardinale Del Monte]‚Ä¶ anche un giovane, che sonava il > Lauto, che vivo, e vero il tutto parea con una caraffa di fiori piena > d‚Äôacqua, che dentro il reflesso d‚Äôua fenestra eccelentemente si scorgeva con > altri ripercotimenti di quella camera dentro l‚Äôacqua, e sopra quei fiori > eravi una viva rugiada con ogni esquisita diligenza finta. E questo (disse) > che fu il piu bel pezzo, che facesse mai. (\\"He also painted [for Cardinal > Del Monte] a young man, playing the Lute, who seemed altogether alive and > real with a carafe of flowers full of water, in which you could see > perfectly the reflection of a window and other reflections of that room > inside the water, and on those flowers there was a lively dew depicted with > every exquisite care. And this (he said) was the best piece that he ever > painted.)\\" Giovanni Baglione, Le Vite de‚Äô Pittori, scultori et archtietti, > Roma, 1642, p.136 The painting exists in three versions. All show a boy with soft facial features and thick brown hair, accompanying himself on the lute as he sings a madrigal about love. As in the Uffizi Bacchus, the artist places a table-top in front of the figure. In the Hermitage and Badminton House versions it is bare marble, with a violin on one side and a still life of flowers and fruit on the other. In the Wildenstein version the table is covered with a carpet and extended forwards to hold a tenor recorder, while the still life is replaced by a spinetta (a small keyboard instrument) and a caged songbird. The musical instruments are valuable and probably came from Del Monte's personal collection. The Lute Player (detail from the Hermitage version). The Hermitage and Badminton House versions show madrigals by Jacques Arcadelt (1515‚Äì1568), and the visible text reads in part: \\"Vous savez que je vous aime et vous adore...Je fus v√¥tre.\\" (\\"You know I love you and adore you...I was yours\\"). The Wildenstein version shows songs by a native Florentine (Francesco de Layolle) on a text by Petrarch: Laisse le voile ('Let go the veil') and Pourquoi ne vous donnez-vous pas? ('Why do you not give yourself?') by Giachetto Berchem (Jacquet de Berchem). The flowers and damaged fruit, and the cracked body of the lute, suggest the theme of transience: love, like all things, is fleeting and mortal. The choice of Franco-Flemish composers over native Italians ‚Äì only Layolle was a native Italian ‚Äì no doubt reflects the cultural (and political) affiliations of the pro-French Del Monte-Giustiniani circle. The still life elements are of an extremely high standard in all versions, the finely rendered fruit and flowers in two versions equalled by the textures of spinetta and flute in the other, and the artist has reproduced the initial notes of the madrigals so exactly that one can recognize the Roman printer, Valerio Dorica. The rather androgynous model could be Pedro Montoya, a castrato known to have been a member of the Del Monte household and a singer at the Sistine Chapel at about this time - castrati were highly prized and the Cardinal was a patron of music as well as of painting. More recently Caravaggio biographer Peter Robb has identified him as Caravaggio's companion Mario Minniti, the model for several other paintings from this period including The Cardsharps and one of the two versions of The Fortune Teller. All three versions demonstrate the innovative approach to light that Caravaggio adopted at this time. Caravaggio's method, as described by Caravaggio's contemporary Giulio Mancini, was to use \\"a strong light from above with a single window and the walls painted black, so that having the lights bright and the shadows dark, it gives depth to the painting, but with a method that is not natural nor done or thought of by any other century or older painters like Raphael, Titian, Correggio and others.\\" The room itself seems to be the same as that in the Contarelli Chapel Calling of Saint Matthew, and the beam of light across the rear wall has an upper limit that would appear to be the shutter of the window above the table in the Calling. The carafe is a \\"cut-and-paste\\" motif from another image, where the main light came from a window at more or less the same level as the carafe itself.Prof. Martin Kemp (Nature, Nov. 2002, p. 364). Such a complex illustration of refracted light is unprecedented in the Cinquecento, and may have been the result of collaboration with scientists in Del Monte's circle, including Giovanni Battista della Porta, who was the guiding spirit behind the foundation in 1603 of the Accademia dei Lincei. His multi-volume De Refractione Optices (1593) was particularly concerned with optical matters, the second volume being devoted entirely to the incidence of light on water- filled and glass spheres. The circle of Della Porta was significant for Caravaggio later on in Naples, where the commission for the Seven Acts of Mercy seems to have emanated from Giovanni Batista Manso, Marchese di Villa, whose friend, the alchemist Colantonio Stigliola, was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei. The appearance of second originals is a feature of a new understanding of Caravaggio's work, and indeed Vincenzo Giustiniani, whose experience was closely related to the artist's career, describes in his Discorso sulla pittura the painter's development as beginning with copying others‚Äô work - ‚ÄòProceeding further, he can also copy his own work, so that the replica may be as good, and even sometimes better, than the first‚Äô. The procedure for making a second version was, however, substantially different from the sometimes very arduous task of building a group from many separate observations of reality, of figures and objects; it is natural that the ‚Äòsecond original‚Äô is sometimes more fluent than the first. The anatomical anomalies in the Wildenstein and Badminton House paintings, like the slightly out of line eyes, or the hesitations in the profile of the hand, are resolved in the Hermitage picture. By contrast, the Hermitage version is more cursory in the drapery, less insistent in the detail, and it does not have the magnificent reflections in the carafe, which were specific to the alchemical context of the original. This is also the reason for the jealousy with which the group of pictures was regarded by Caravaggio's patron Del Monte, and for the misunderstanding that the pursuit of natural philosophy incurred in the Rome of his day. Apollo Lute Player (detail of flowers covered in dew as described by Baglione in 1642) The Wildenstein version was sold by Del Monte's heirs to Cardinal Antonio Barberini in 1628, when it was described as \\"Un giovane che sona di clevo\\" (without an attribution) and included with St Catherine and the Cardsharps (named specifically as by Caravaggio) and various other paintings. The painting is illuminated by a soft chiaroscuro inspired by the Brescia masters of the 16th century and characteristic of the early phase of Caravaggio's development. The catalogue to the 1990 exhibition held to mark the identification of the Wildenstein Lute Player - which was already known but thought to be a copy by another hand - commented on the markedly different lighting used for this version, claiming that it \\"marks a significant step toward the more dramatically lit, highly focused style of Caravaggio's maturity\\" - i.e., towards the heightened contrast between shadows and light (tenebrism) that would mark paintings such as The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew. Nevertheless, critic Jason Kaufman felt that the rendition of the boy in the Wildenstein version was aesthetically inferior to the Hermitage, \\"...the face...hard and the expression less sweet than bovine...[t]he features...more sharply defined, the eyebrows severely geometrized, and the complexion pink, rather than fleshtone, \\" and David Van Edwards, noting apparent mistakes in the depiction of the lute in the Wildenstein version, the secondary light source and the inconsistent perspectives of table and sitter, concluded that the painting is not by Caravaggio.D. Van Edwards ‚ÄúA Caravaggio re-discovered?‚Äù Lute News, n. 50, June 1999 pp. 5-7 The Hermitage version is from the collection of the artist's other important patron of the period, Del Monte's friend and neighbour, Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani. It was purchased in 1808 at the Paris auction by Russian emperor Alexander I through his personal art adviser Valily Rudanovsky. Purchasing was supported by Dominique Vivant Denon. Badminton House version The Badminton House painting came to light at auction in Sotheby's, New York (January 25, 2001, lot 179); the painting was sold attributed to the circle of Caravaggio, possibly by Carlo Magnone. Clovis Whitfield, an art-dealer based in London, has questioned the attribution and suggested the Badminton House painting may actually be by Caravaggio. Originally covered in a thick yellow varnish, it corresponds in all details with the description made by Baglione of the work he saw at Cardinal Del Monte's palace. The flowers are scattered with dewdrops as Baglione remarks, and the carafe of water reflects the window and other features of the room. These elements, and the considerable number of pentimenti (incisions made in the paint with the brush-handle, a common working method seen also in Leonardo's Salvator-Mundi), set the Badminton House painting apart from the Hermitage version. It is slightly larger than the Hermitage work, whose original edge cuts the flowers on the left and the scroll of the violin, and painted with denser brushwork. This painting would seem to be the one described in the 1627 inventory of Del Monte's collection. It was not the painting described in 1628 by the heirs as ‚ÄòUn giovane che sona di clevo‚Äô (without an attribution) which was sold together with Caravaggio's 'St Catherine and the 'Cardsharps (named specifically as by Caravaggio) and various other paintings to Cardinal Antonio Barberini, which has come down to us in the work in the Wildenstein collection, at present on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Apollo Lute Player (detail) The flowerpiece is of major importance for the still-life tradition, not only in Italy, but also in the Netherlands, and there is a certain link to earlier Flemish painting; for example, many of the Flemish flower painters, from Jan Brueghel to Ambrosius Bosschaert and Van der Ast, often waited to study separate specimens in various seasons of the year but include them all in a fictive assembly. The fruits in the Luteplayer, however, are not of the same season as the flowers, suggesting a similar cross-seasonal approach as Brueghel and Bosschaert. The flowers correspond with those illustrated by Giovanni Battista della Porta in his Magia Naturale (Naples, 1589) as ones corresponding to vision, from the marigold that looks like the Sun, the yellow cornflower that looks like the eye, to another flower that resembles the eyebright that was since the Middle Ages an ingredient in eye remedies. This would go some way to explaining the nature of the choice of the flowers, which are dominated by the irises at the top, and Iris was not only the messenger of the gods, but in the optical frame stood for the rainbow and the spectrum of colours that the various flowers represent. Once again, Della Porta's De refractione optices has an entire book devoted to ‚ÄòDe Iride et colore‚Äô, an attempt to arrive at an understanding of the rainbow. But the naturalism of the flowers, including the seedpods of the iris and the shrivelled florets, shows that Caravaggio was observing these from actual specimens, and not improving on what Nature might have arrived at had circumstances been different. The tacit expression of the theory of segnatura, the correspondence of certain forms from the natural world with those in man, is something that links the thinking behind the painting with Paracelsian belief. Del Monte's interest in this is manifest in the group of portraits that hung in his alchemical Casino, which are of the same seven luminaries who are illustrated in the titlepage of Oswald Croll's Basilica Chymica (Frankfurt, 1609). We know that the Casino on the Pincio was the centre in Rome of the practice of iatrochymia or chemical medicine, although this kind of natural philosophy was increasingly frowned on and may well have played a part in the damnation memoriae that Del Monte was subjected to. But Federico Cesi and his Accademia dei Lincei were also dedicated followers of what they perceived as Paracelsian disciplines. It appears likely that the Lute Player was originally intended as a decoration for the studiolo on the first floor of the Casino on the Pincio that Del Monte had acquired in 1596, and where Guercino would later paint his fresco of Aurora for the Ludovisi. On the ground floor Del Monte did his alchemical work and chemistry; above, on the ceiling of the studiolo, Caravaggio painted the gods Neptune, Jupiter and Pluto, representing the Elements. Apollo would have struck the right chord in representing the harmony of the universe, in a place opposite the single window.Clovis Whitfield ‚ÄúThe Camerino of Cardinal del Monte‚Äù Paragone, LIX, n.77, 2008, pp. 3-38 Already the strength of his painting style was in painting classical subjects from life around him, like the Bacchus in the painting in the Uffizi, their features were sometimes disguised by their contemporary appearance. Since Giordano Bruno had written that it was appropriate to represent Apollo, ever-youthful, playing the lute, as opposed to his more conventional lyre, this may have been Del Monte's intention in this painting, and the rays of sunlight that are such a feature of the glass sphere have this meaning. Apollo is very much in place in a room devoted to the elements, as is implied in the ceiling painting, for the Stanza degli Elementi that Vasari did in Palazzo Vecchio has Apollo with the Chariot of the Sun in its middle, and Del Monte had this subject as the centrepiece of the ceiling in his new studiolo in Palazzo Avogadro, painted by Andrea Sacchi. Indeed, one of the most copied images in Giulio Romano's decoration of the Palazzo del Te is the ceiling with that perhaps Caravaggio may have known from a drawing. The studiolo had room also for another of Del Monte's pictures, the Shepherd Corydon. This work, now in the Capitoline Museum, has long been misconstrued as St. John the Baptist, but apart from the exhibitionist subject of the young boy, the ram (instead of a lamb) is a contradiction for that subject. Instead the work is an emblematic subject: the ram represents the first sign of the Zodiac, Aries, at the period of the spring equinox and the energy of that season. In the combination of themes, the harmony of the spheres is represented figuratively by Apollo the Luteplayer, where the spring equinox and the spring flowers are balanced by the fruits of autumn on the table - from the autumn equinox - under the sign of Libra, when the forces of nature are once again in equilibrium. It is easier to see the effeminate beauty of the shepherd as corresponding to Del Monte's personal aesthetic taste, than as the work that Ciriaco Mattei commissioned shortly afterwards for his first-born son, named indeed Giovanni Battista, a painting that is to be sought in one of the many paintings of St John the Baptist that Caravaggio executed. There was such a picture, painted for the Mattei family and later also bought by Cardinal Pio from the Del Monte collection, an oblong composition with St John playing with a lamb, and with a reed cross on his shoulder, that was eventually sold to Gavin Hamilton in 1777. Apollo Lute Player during cleaning The idea of \\"correspondences\\" that informed so much of contemporary natural philosophy, means that the globe of the carafe with its reflections, like a crystal ball, would have been seen as a parallel with the celestial globe on the ceiling with the Elements above. This feature, described in the painting of the Luteplayer that Baglione saw presumably in situ with Cardinal Del Monte, is absent from the Hermitage version. Elements of the composition of the Apollo Lute Player are repeated not only in the Hermitage work (with several counterpoint variations), but also in the glass carafe in the lower part of the two paintings A Boy bitten by a Lizard, most especially in the version in the National Gallery, London. There the central rose and white jasmine is quite close to these elements in the present work, while in the Longhi Foundation picture the rose is a white one. The lower daisy in the present work has been repositioned, and in fact a prominent pentiment exists 3 cm above, and that is the position it has in the Hermitage painting of the Luteplayer. It could well be that the original flowerpiece that we know Del Monte owned of Caravaggio's, which he seems to have bought even before he met him, probably through the local picture dealer Maestro Valentino, could have been the continuing source of these variations. It was a painting described as a carafe of flowers, two palmi high, which was bought at the 1628 sale of the Del Monte collection in a lot that included the Musicians, but it has not been heard of since. It is interesting that he would devote such care to a painting of flowers, as he did also to the Basket of Fruit in the Ambrosiana, and that he was not averse to doing this, as is illustrated by the fact that he introduced the carafe of water with the same reflections into the canvases of the A Boy bitten by a Lizard, without regard to the position of the figure in front of the light sources. Since the artist spent, according to Bellori, four or five years in Rome doing repetitious devotional images, and copies of portrait heads ‚Äòun grosso l‚Äôuno‚Äô, it was natural for him to repeat his own inventions when he arrived at this sensational new technique of copying reality, from a virtual image, instead of other people's compositions. The parabolic mirror, probably the same one that Della Porta had had constructed in Venice in 1580, which had produced some sensational effects and led to the development of the camera obscura, was probably no larger than an eye-glass, but it made it possible to make a mosaic of naturalistic images that was extremely compelling; the technique also explains the shallow focus of Caravaggio's compositions.

All three members composed songs and sang. They managed an international tour in the U.S. and Canada, including dates with The Ramones, and performances for the troops as part of the United Services Organization (USO). Career The Nerves lasted a short time and self-released one self- titled four-song EP in 1976, featuring the songs \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\" (Lee), \\"When You Find Out\\" (Case), \\"Give Me Some Time\\" (Lee), and \\"Working Too Hard\\" (Collins). In addition to being the drummer, Paul Collins was also the trio's manager and did most of the bookings and promotion. The Nerves' EP was distributed by independent Bomp! Records and officially re-released on CD and vinyl by Alive Records in 2008, followed by a second release of The Breakaways, an album of post-Nerves recordings made by Collins and Case prior to the formation of Collins' group The Beat. Despite their limited lifespan and discography, The Nerves remain notable for many reasons. They were the founding vanguard of the Los Angeles punk and pop scenes that eventually produced The Knack, The Beat and The Plimsouls. After The Nerves' break-up, Case and Collins formed The Breakaways with Pat Stengl, a group that would have an even shorter lifespan than The Nerves. Thereafter, however, Case and Collins went on to front more notable groups, The Plimsouls (who had a Billboard Top 100 hit with \\"A Million Miles Away\\") and The Beat, respectively. But perhaps the most notable legacy of the group is the song \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\": Blondie later covered the song on their album Parallel Lines and turned it into a UK top 5 hit, and thanks to Blondie's success, the song has become something of a standard, later re-done by groups as diverse as L7, Def Leppard, Cat Power (whose version was featured in Cingular commercials in 2006), and Hep Alien, Lane Kim's fictional band on dramedy The Gilmore Girls. While it is likely some of these artists are unaware of the original Nerves version, others were also from Los Angeles and what was, at the time, its small underground music scene and would be able to reference the original. Blondie included a second Lee composition on Parallel Lines, \\"Will Anything Happen?\\" Lee also went on to write a hit for Paul Young, \\"Come Back and Stay\\". \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\" and \\"When You Find Out\\" were later released on a 1993 Rhino Records power-pop compilation, DIY: Come Out and Play - American Power Pop I (1975-1978), which Allmusic gave a five star review. The Nerves also appeared on the album's cover. More recently, Rhino included an unreleased Nerves track, Case's \\"One-Way Ticket\\", on the 2005 compilation Children of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the Second Psychedelic Era, 1976‚Äì1995, a sequel to their Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 compilations. In 2008, Alive Records released One Way Ticket, a CD compilation of the remastered tracks of the Nerves' original EP, along with demos and other previously unreleased material. Following the success of The Nerves' CD reissue, Alive Records released The Breakaways, an album of post-Nerves recordings featuring Collins and Case prior to the formation of The Beat. In 2011, the American rock band Green Day launched the American Idiot Broadway Musical Production. On any night that an original cast member left the show, they included a live rendition of the song \\"Walking Out On Love,\\" which was written by Paul Collins. The song was previously recorded by The Nerves, The Breakaways and The Beat. At the end of the musical's run, The Paul Collins Beat joined Green Day on-stage for live performances in New York. Reunion tribute In spring 2012, Case and Collins announced a reunion tour paying tribute to their bands The Nerves, The Breakaways, The Beat and The Plimsouls. The band line-up for the Collins and Case tour was augmented by members of The Paul Collins Beat (Timm Buechler, bass, and Amos Pitsch, drums), offering audiences with a full-band electric showcase. The reunion was not billed as The Nerves, because Jack Lee chose not to be part of the tour. The tour included a date in Austin, Texas, where actor Bill Murray made a surprise appearance at the concert to introduce the band. Collins' group The Beat had previously appeared on the Caddyshack original motion picture soundtrack alongside Murray in 1979. Collins was dismissed from the tour before its completion, due to personal differences. The tour was followed by a tribute LP/cassette on Volar Records/I Hate Rock n Roll, entitled Under the Covers Vol. 2: A Tribute to Paul Collins, Peter Case, and Jack Lee, that included 18 bands, such as Grass Widow, Davila 666, Hunx and his Punx, Audacity, Tijuana Panthers, and the Mantles. Lee has performed annually as a solo artist with his group Jack Lee Inferno.

E. F. Rent's discovery and first publications  In the 1960s, E. F. Rent, an IBM employee, found a remarkable trend between the number of pins (terminals, T) at the boundaries of integrated circuit designs at IBM and the number of internal components (g), such as logic gates or standard cells. On a log‚Äìlog plot, these datapoints were on a straight line, implying a power-law relation T = t g^p, where t and p are constants (p < 1.0, and generally 0.5 < p < 0.8). Rent's findings in IBM-internal memoranda were published in the IBM Journal of Research and Development in 2005, but the relation was described in 1971 by Landman and Russo. They performed a hierarchical circuit partitioning in such a way that at each hierarchical level (top-down) the least number of interconnections had to be cut to partition the circuit (in more or less equal parts). At each partitioning step, they noted the number of terminals and the number of components in each partition and then partitioned the sub-partitions further. They found the power-law rule applied to the resulting T versus g plot and named it \\"Rent's rule\\". Rent's rule is an empirical result based on observations of existing designs, and therefore it is less applicable to the analysis of non- traditional circuit architectures. However, it provides a useful framework with which to compare similar architectures.  Theoretical basis  Christie and Stroobandt later derived Rent's rule theoretically for homogeneous systems and pointed out that the amount of optimization achieved in placement is reflected by the parameter p, the \\"Rent exponent\\", which also depends on the circuit topology. In particular, values p<1 correspond to a greater fraction of short interconnects. The constant t in Rent's rule can be viewed as the average number of terminals required by a single logic block, since T = t when g = 1.  Special cases and applications  Random arrangement of logic blocks typically have p=1. Larger values are impossible, since the maximal number of terminals for any region containing g logic components in a homogeneous system is given by T = t g. Lower bounds on p depend on the interconnection topology, since it is generally impossible to make all wires short. This lower bound p* is often called the \\"intrinsic Rent exponent\\", a notion first introduced by Hagen et al. It can be used to characterize optimal placements and also measure the interconnection complexity of a circuit. Higher (intrinsic) Rent exponent values correspond to a higher topological complexity. One extreme example (p=0) is a long chain of logic blocks, while a clique has p=1. In realistic 2D circuits, p* ranges from 0.5 for highly-regular circuits (such as SRAM) to 0.75 for random logic. System performance analysis tools such as BACPAC typically use Rent's rule to calculate expected wiring lengths and wiring demands.  Estimating Rent's exponent  To estimate Rent's exponent, one can use top-down partitioning, as used in min-cut placement. For every partition, count the number of terminals connected to the partition and compare it to the number of logic blocks in the partition. Rent's exponent can then be found by fitting these datapoints on a log‚Äìlog plot, resulting in an exponent p'. For optimally partitioned circuits, p' = p* but this is no longer the case for practical (heuristic) partitioning approaches. For partitioning- based placement algorithms p^* \\\\leq p' \\\\leq p.  Region II of Rent's rule  Landman and Russo found a deviation of Rent's rule near the \\"far end\\", i.e., for partitions with a large number of blocks, which is known as \\"Region II\\" of Rent's Rule. A similar deviation also exists for small partitions and has been found by Stroobandt, who called it \\"Region III\\".  Rentian wirelength estimation  Another IBM employee, Donath, discovered that Rent's rule can be used to estimate the average wirelength and the wirelength distribution in VLSI chips. This motivated the System Level Interconnect Prediction workshop, founded in 1999, and an entire community working on wirelength prediction (see a survey by Stroobandt). The resulting wirelength estimates have been improved significantly since then and are now used for \\"technology exploration\\". The use of Rent's rule allows to perform such estimates a priori (i.e., before actual placement) and thus predict the properties of future technologies (clock frequencies, number of routing layers needed, area, power) based on limited information about future circuits and technologies. A comprehensive overview of work based on Rent's rule has been published by Stroobandt.

Design and development Before the experimental Cierva C.19 Mk V, autogyros had been controlled in the same way as fixed-wing aircraft, that is by deflecting the air flowing over moving surfaces such as ailerons, elevators and rudder. At the very low speeds encountered in autogyro flight, particularly during landing, these controls became ineffective. The experimental machine showed that the way forward was a tilting rotor hub fitted with a hanging stick extending to the pilot's cockpit with which he could change the rotor plane. This was known as direct control and was fitted to the C.30. The production variant, called C.30A in England, was preceded by several development machines. The first production design in the series was the C.30, a radial-engined autogyro with a three-blade, 37 ft (11.3 m) rotor mounted on an aft-leaning tripod, the control column extending into the rear of the two cockpits. The engine was the five-cylinder, 105 hp (78 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major I used in the C.19 series. The fabric- covered fuselage carried an unbraced tailplane, without elevators but with turned-up tips. The port side of the tailplane had an inverted aerofoil section to counter roll-axis torque produced by the propeller. As with most autogyros, a high vertical tail was precluded by the sagging resting rotor, so the dorsal fin was long and low, extending well aft of the tailplane like a fixed rudder and augmented by a ventral fin. The wide-track undercarriage had a pair of single, wire-braced legs and a small tail wheel was fitted. This model flew in April 1933. It was followed by four improved machines designated C.30P (P here for pre-production) which differed in having a four-legged pyramid rotor mounting and a reinforced undercarriage with three struts per side. The rotor could be folded rearwards for transport. The C.30P used the more powerful (140 hp, 104 kW) seven-cylinder Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major IA radial engine. Avro 671 (Cierva C.30A) taxiing for take-off at Auster's Rearsby Aerodrome in June 1951 The production model, called the C.30A by Avro, was built under licence in Britain, France and Germany and was similar to the C.30P. The main alteration was a further increase in undercarriage track with revised strutting, the uppermost leg having a pronounced knee with wire bracing. There was additional bracing to the tailplane and both it and the fin carried small movable trimming surfaces. Each licensee used nationally built engines and used slightly different names. In all, 143 production C.30s were built, making it by far the most numerous pre-war autogyro. Between 1933 and 1936, de la Cierva used one C.30A (G-ACWF) to test his last contribution to autogyro development before his death in the crash of a KLM Douglas DC-2 airliner at Croydon Airfield in England on 9 December 1936. To enable the aircraft to take off without forward ground travel, he produced the \\"autodynamic\\" rotor head, which allowed the rotor to be spun up by the engine in the usual way but to higher than take-off r.p.m at zero rotor incidence and then to reach operational positive pitch suddenly enough to jump some 20 ft (6 m) upwards. At least one Royal Air Force (RAF) C.30A was on floats as a Sea Rota in January 1935. Production ;Avro Avro obtained the licence in 1934 and subsequently built 78 examples, under their model designation, fitted with an Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major IA (known in the RAF as the Civet 1) 7-cylinder radial engine producing . The first production C.30A was delivered in July 1934. ;Lior√©-et-Olivier Twenty-five aircraft were built in France by Lior√©-et-Olivier as the LeO C.301 with a 175 hp (130 kW) Salmson 9NE 9-cylinder radial engine. ;Focke-Wulf Forty aircraft were built in Germany as the Focke-Wulf Fw 30 Heuschrecke (Grasshopper) with a 140 hp (105 kW) Siemens Sh 14A 7-cylinder radial engine. Operational history Of the 66 non-RAF aircraft built in the UK by Avro, 37 appeared at least for a while on the UK register. Some (maybe a dozen) were sold abroad, but others were flown by wealthy enthusiasts and by flying clubs who offered autogyro training. By the end of the decade, private flyers were moving back to the comforts and economies of fixed-wing aircraft and more C.30s moved abroad leaving the Autogyro Flying Club at London Air Park, Hanworth as the major UK user. 26 aircraft were directly exported by Avro. These went both to private owners and to foreign air forces who wish to investigate the autogyro's potential. In 1934, one Spanish Navy C.30 piloted by Cierva landed on the Spanish Seaplane tender Dedalo anchored in Valencia harbor and later made a takeoff.La Cierva and the Transportable Station of Naval Aeronautic (in Spanish) In September 1935, five members of the Lithuanian Aero Club flew C.30A in the \\"air train\\" together with the glider Schneider Grunau Baby and the airplane de Havilland DH.60 Moth over the Baltic sea states: Kaunas, Riga, Tallinn, Helsinki.Lithuanian Aviation History 1919-1940. Air train (in Lithuanian) Twelve C.30As built by Avro for the Royal Air Force (RAF) entered service as the Avro 671 Rota Mk 1 (Serials K4230 to K4239 and K4296 & K4775). The twelve were delivered between 1934 and 1935. They equipped the School of Army Co- operation at RAF Old Sarum near Salisbury. Many of the surviving civil aircraft were also taken into RAF service between 1939 and 1940. In 1940 they equipped 1448 Flt. at RAF Duxford. Later they equipped 529 Sqn. at RAF Halton on radar calibration work, disbanded in October 1945, the twelve survivors were sold on to civilian owners. Most of these did not last long, although two were used for pilot rotary wing experience by Fairey in their Fairey Gyrodyne helicopter programme. Rota Towels kept one ex-RAF Rota airworthy G-AHTZ until an accident in 1958. G-ACUU, the Imperial War Museum's C.30A exhibit at Duxford had one of the longest active lives. It joined Air Service Training Ltd in 1934, was impressed (as Rota HM580) in 1942, serving with 529 Squadron and returning to civil use by G.S. Baker based at Birmingham's Elmdon airport with its original registration plus the nickname Billy Boy and was not withdrawn from use until 1960.

All LeO C-30 autogyros were destroyed or captured by German forces during the invasion of France in 1940. ;Lior√© et Olivier LeO C-30S: Construction number 26 was completed as the sole C-30S. ;Lior√©-et-Olivier LeO C-301: Improved C-30s with uprated Messier oleo- pneumatic shock absorbers, flotation devices to facilitate ditching at sea and tripod main rotor support. Six aircraft were delivered to the French Navy by early June 1940. ;Lior√© et Olivier LeO C-302:Early autogyros suffered from relatively long take-off runs. To reduce the take-off length two C-301 aircraft were fitted with the equivalent of Cierva's \\"Jump\\" head allowing the aircraft to leap vertically after only a very short run. The C-302s were used extensively for testing rotor and undercarriage components but development was eventually abandoned in 1949/1950. ;Focke-Wulf C 30 Heuschrecke: (Heuschrecke (Grasshopper)): 40 aircraft built, each with a Siemens Sh 14A 7-cylinder radial engine.

Some news agencies have given her name as May Shigenobu. Early life She was born in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, her father was a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine guerilla leader (not named by Mei due to security reasons) and her mother was the Japanese Red Army member Fusako Shigenobu. After three Japanese volunteers for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine PFLP External Operations executed an attack on Israel's Lod Airport (see Lod Airport massacre) on 30 May 1972, PFLP leaders and other Japanese volunteers became targets for Israel's assassinations. In retaliation for the attack, PFLP's spokesman Ghassan Kanafani was killed on July 8, 1972, by the Israeli Intelligence Agency Mossad in a car bomb. Mei's mother became wanted by the INTERPOL in 1974 after the French embassy hostage-taking in Hague in which she was thought to be involved, so Mei had to move frequently and used aliases to evade reprisals by her mother's enemies. Mei Shigenobu lived some of her childhood years in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon; Fusako Shigenobu was absent for months at a time and Mei was raised in those periods by her mother's comrades in the Japanese Red Army and Arab friends and supporters; while her birth father was killed sometime during her childhood. She had her early education in several schools in Lebanon and in other countries she refuses to name. She studied journalism at the Lebanese University as well as going to the American University of Beirut in Lebanon for her tertiary education where she continued her graduate studies in International Relations. During those years, she learned to speak fluent Arabic and English, but hid her knowledge of Japanese, fearing that if her identity as Fusako Shigenobu's daughter were to become known publicly, her mother might be captured. Though she was not a citizen of any country until March 2001, when she received Japanese citizenship. Return to Japan She came out of hiding after her mother was captured in Osaka, and visited Japan for the first time in April 2001, making her the first child of a Red Army member to return to Japan in five years. She was the subject of some controversy in December 2001 when she gave a talk at a public school in Kanagawa Prefecture about Arab culture and food at the invitation of a teacher there; the Israeli embassy in Tokyo sent a complaint to the school, describing her discussion as conveying \\"blatant, biased political\\" anti-Israeli sentiments. She then began working as an English teacher in a cram school in Tokyo. Japanese lawyers, scholars, journalists, writers and activists responded by signing a protest petition against the Israeli embassy and government saying that Mei was now a Japanese citizen and had the right to freedom of speech in Japan. Mei later became an anchor on Japanese cable television channel Asahi Newstar's (TV Asahi's news channel) one-hour live political programme News no Shins≈ç. She is currently MBC's (Middle East Broadcasting Center, the United Arab Emirates' Arabic satellite channel) Tokyo correspondent, reporting in Arabic about Japan. She earned her PhD degree in Media Studies from Doshisha University in 2011, doing research on the development of Arabic media, and the effect of satellite channels (a case study of Al Jazeera) on Arab societies. Mei Shigenobu is a supporter of Palestinian statehood and a critic of Israel. In contrast to Bettina's (Ulrike Meinhof's daughter) disavowal, shown in Children of the Revolution, she views her mother's actions with pride, to the point of stating that she considers her a role model, merely repeating, as her mother, that those were different times, as she mentioned to the Standard, \\"there were no means of gaining media attention\\", and with today's media and communication, other venues prove far more effective. She attempted to justify the group's terrorist activities by saying that in the 1970s‚Äì1980s people had very different \\"moral values\\", different \\"sensibilities and ways of thinking\\", implying that her mother's sentence should be rendered invalid and echoing her mother's claim that since the criminal acts carried out had had political aims, she should not be convicted but rather offered a \\"political way out\\". In popular culture Mei Shigenobu appears in Nobuyuki Oura's November 2006 movie . Mei also appears in , a documentary featuring the life of the Japanese Rock band and its lead singer PANTA.

It is down the line from and is situated between to the south and to the north. Its three-letter station code is THI. The station is about outside of Thirsk town centre and is actually on the edge of the village of Carlton Miniott. There are four tracks, but only the outer two have platforms. From satellite imagery it can look as if there are platforms on the inner two tracks, but examination on the ground shows this not to be true; the platform faces serving the innermost pair of tracks were removed in the 1970s in preparation for higher-speed main line running using InterCity 125 trains. The station is operated by TransPennine Express. Other train services are provided by the open-access operator Grand Central. History The railway line between York and was built by the Great North of England Railway, most of which was authorised in 1837; the line was formally opened on 30 March 1841. The station at Thirsk, which opened to the public on 31 March 1841, was originally named Newcastle Junction. In 1933 Britain's first route-setting power signal box using a switch panel rather than a lever frame opened at Thirsk, to the specification of the LNER's signalling engineers A.F. Bound and A. E. Tattersall, forming the template for many such future installations on the nation's railway network. Larger schemes to a similar design followed at other locations on the former North Eastern Railway network, such as Hull Paragon (1938), Northallerton (1939) and York (1951 - the resignalling project was interrupted by the Second World War and not completed until after nationalisation). Thirsk signal box itself, after various alterations over the course of its life, eventually closed around 1989 under the York IECC signalling scheme. Facilities The station has a staffed ticket office (on the southbound platform), which is open through the week (06:45-19:30 Mondays to Saturdays, 08:45-17:30 Sundays) and there is also self-service ticket machine available (this can be used for collecting pre- paid tickets as well as for purchasing when the ticket office is closed). There is a waiting shelter on the northbound platform and customer help points and digital CIS displays on both sides. Step-free access to both platforms is via a barrow crossing and only possible when the station is staffed.Thirsk station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 7 February 2017 Services There is generally an hourly service northbound to via and southbound to , , and . One late evening northbound TransPennine service to also stops at Thirsk. Grand Central Railway operates five fast services a day to , stopping only at York, with northbound services to .

Specifically, it is used in the modeling of thin structures that react elastically to external forces.  Notation  It is written as : abla^4\\\\varphi=0 or : abla^2 abla^2\\\\varphi=0 or :\\\\Delta^2\\\\varphi=0 where abla^4, which is the fourth power of the del operator and the square of the Laplacian operator abla^2 (or \\\\Delta), is known as the biharmonic operator or the bilaplacian operator. In Cartesian coordinates, it can be written in n dimensions as: : abla^4\\\\varphi=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n\\\\partial_i\\\\partial_i\\\\partial_j\\\\partial_j \\\\varphi =\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\partial_i\\\\partial_i\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\partial_j\\\\partial_j\\\\right) \\\\varphi. Because the formula here contains a summation of indices, many mathematicians prefer the notation \\\\Delta^2 over abla^4 because the former makes clear which of the indices of the four nabla operators are contracted over. For example, in three dimensional Cartesian coordinates the biharmonic equation has the form : {\\\\partial^4 \\\\varphi\\\\over \\\\partial x^4 } + {\\\\partial^4 \\\\varphi\\\\over \\\\partial y^4 } + {\\\\partial^4 \\\\varphi\\\\over \\\\partial z^4 }+ 2{\\\\partial^4 \\\\varphi\\\\over \\\\partial x^2\\\\partial y^2}+ 2{\\\\partial^4 \\\\varphi\\\\over \\\\partial y^2\\\\partial z^2}+ 2{\\\\partial^4 \\\\varphi\\\\over \\\\partial x^2\\\\partial z^2} = 0.

A solution to the biharmonic equation is called a biharmonic function. Any harmonic function is biharmonic, but the converse is not always true.

History The Team Valley line of the North Eastern Railway, which connected Newton Hall Junction near with , was authorised in 1848 but not opened until 2 March 1868 (the powers having been renewed in 1862). At first only freight trains used the route, but passenger services began on 1 December 1868, and the station at Chester-le-Street opened the same day. In the 1960s, the station was listed for closure as part of the Beeching cuts, which led to it being mentioned in the song Slow Train by Flanders and Swann. However it was saved and remains open.

Persistent in his resistance against Safavid Persian aggression, he was killed in the Battle of Garisi. Life The eldest son of David X, he succeeded on the abdication of his uncle, George IX, in 1527 (more accepted date) or 1534. When young, he distinguished himself as a commander in his father‚Äôs army, particularly at the Battle of Teleti (1522), won by a Persian invasion army in spite of heavy losses. He established close contacts with Bagrat III of Imereti, king of Imereti (western Georgia) and married in 1526 his daughter. A year later, he was crowned king of Kartli and launched a series of measures to strengthen the kingdom‚Äôs defence capacity amid the ongoing war between Safavid Persia and Ottoman Turkey (1514-1555). In alliance with Bagrat of Imereti, Luarsab fought both empires trying to preserve his independence and reestablish close cooperation between various Georgian polities. In 1535, Bagrat conquered a pro-Ottoman southern Georgian principality of Samtskhe, granting its province Javakheti to Kartli. The Kartlian-Imeretian alliance was soon joined by another Georgian monarch, Levan I of Kakheti. However, the 1541 invasion by the Persian shah Tahmasp I forced Levan out of a Georgian coalition, it left most of Kartli in ruins, and the capital Tbilisi garrisoned by a Persian force. The year 1545 brought another misfortune: a combined army of the Imeretian and Kartlian kings were crushed by the Ottomans at the Battle of Sokhoista and expelled from Samtskhe. From 1547 to 1554, Kartli suffered three more invasions by Tahmasp of Persia, who overran the country, but failed to force the king into submission. The Treaty of Amasya, 1555, between the Safavids and Ottomans left Georgia divided between these empires, with the east under Persian domination and the west under Turkish control. Luarsab, however, did not recognise the treaty, and continued desperate guerilla war against the Persian occupation forces virtually holding them under siege. In order to subdue the stubborn Georgian monarch, Shah Tahmasp sent Shahverdi Sultan, beglarbeg of Ganja and Karabakh, with a large army. Luarsab and his son, Simon, met the invaders at the Battle of Garisi. A heavy fight resulted in a Georgian victory, but Luarsab was mortally wounded. Luarsab was buried at the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral at Mtskheta. Family and children Luarsab I married on March 25, 1526 Tamar of Imereti, daughter of king Bagrat III of Imereti. They had eight children: #A son, who died in 1536 and was buried at Mtskheta #Simon I, King of Kartli #David XI, King of Kartli #Vakhtang (c. 1546‚Äì1605), sometime governor of Akhaldaba and Dirbi. He was married to the certain Tinatin and had had a son, Teimuraz-Mirza, and a daughter, Tamar. Teimuraz-Mirza's son, Luarsab, (died in 1650), was adopted by King Rostom of Kartli as his heir in 1639. Tamar was married to Prince Paremuz Amilakhvari. #Alexander (fl. 1546‚Äì1573) #Levan #A daughter, married Kekaoz Chkheidze (fl. 1570‚Äì1590).

Flory‚ÄìHuggins solution theory is a lattice model of the thermodynamics of polymer solutions which takes account of the great dissimilarity in molecular sizes in adapting the usual expression for the entropy of mixing. The result is an equation for the Gibbs free energy change \\\\Delta G_m for mixing a polymer with a solvent. Although it makes simplifying assumptions, it generates useful results for interpreting experiments. Theory The thermodynamic equation for the Gibbs energy change accompanying mixing at constant temperature and (external) pressure is :\\\\Delta G_m = \\\\Delta H_m - T\\\\Delta S_m \\\\, A change, denoted by \\\\Delta, is the value of a variable for a solution or mixture minus the values for the pure components considered separately. The objective is to find explicit formulas for \\\\Delta H_m and \\\\Delta S_m, the enthalpy and entropy increments associated with the mixing process. The result obtained by Flory and Huggins is :\\\\Delta G_m = RT[\\\\,n_1\\\\ln\\\\phi_1 + n_2\\\\ln\\\\phi_2 + n_1\\\\phi_2\\\\chi_{12}\\\\,] \\\\, The right-hand side is a function of the number of moles n_1 and volume fraction \\\\phi_1 of solvent (component 1), the number of moles n_2 and volume fraction \\\\phi_2 of polymer (component 2), with the introduction of a parameter \\\\chi to take account of the energy of interdispersing polymer and solvent molecules. R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The volume fraction is analogous to the mole fraction, but is weighted to take account of the relative sizes of the molecules. For a small solute, the mole fractions would appear instead, and this modification is the innovation due to Flory and Huggins. In the most general case the mixing parameter, \\\\chi, is a free energy parameter, thus including an entropic component.  Derivation  We first calculate the entropy of mixing, the increase in the uncertainty about the locations of the molecules when they are interspersed. In the pure condensed phases ‚Äî solvent and polymer ‚Äî everywhere we look we find a molecule. Of course, any notion of \\"finding\\" a molecule in a given location is a thought experiment since we can't actually examine spatial locations the size of molecules. The expression for the entropy of mixing of small molecules in terms of mole fractions is no longer reasonable when the solute is a macromolecular chain. We take account of this dissymmetry in molecular sizes by assuming that individual polymer segments and individual solvent molecules occupy sites on a lattice. Each site is occupied by exactly one molecule of the solvent or by one monomer of the polymer chain, so the total number of sites is :N = N_1 + xN_2\\\\, N_1 is the number of solvent molecules and N_2 is the number of polymer molecules, each of which has x segments. For a random walk on a lattice we can calculate the entropy change (the increase in spatial uncertainty) as a result of mixing solute and solvent. :\\\\Delta S_m = -k[\\\\,N_1\\\\ln(N_1/N) + N_2\\\\ln(xN_2/N)\\\\,]\\\\, where k is Boltzmann's constant. Define the lattice volume fractions \\\\phi_1 and \\\\phi_2 :\\\\phi_1 = N_1/N\\\\, :\\\\phi_2 = xN_2/N\\\\, These are also the probabilities that a given lattice site, chosen at random, is occupied by a solvent molecule or a polymer segment, respectively. Thus :\\\\Delta S_m = -k[\\\\,N_1\\\\ln\\\\phi_1 + N_2\\\\ln\\\\phi_2\\\\,]\\\\, For a small solute whose molecules occupy just one lattice site, x equals one, the volume fractions reduce to molecular or mole fractions, and we recover the usual entropy of mixing. In addition to the entropic effect, we can expect an enthalpy change. There are three molecular interactions to consider: solvent- solvent w_{11}, monomer-monomer w_{22} (not the covalent bonding, but between different chain sections), and monomer-solvent w_{12}. Each of the last occurs at the expense of the average of the other two, so the energy increment per monomer-solvent contact is :\\\\Delta w = w_{12} - \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\end{matrix} (w_{22} + w_{11})\\\\, The total number of such contacts is :xN_2z\\\\phi_1 = N_1\\\\phi_2z\\\\, where z is the coordination number, the number of nearest neighbors for a lattice site, each one occupied either by one chain segment or a solvent molecule. That is, xN_2 is the total number of polymer segments (monomers) in the solution, so xN_2z is the number of nearest- neighbor sites to all the polymer segments. Multiplying by the probability \\\\phi_1 that any such site is occupied by a solvent molecule, we obtain the total number of polymer-solvent molecular interactions. An approximation following mean field theory is made by following this procedure, thereby reducing the complex problem of many interactions to a simpler problem of one interaction. The enthalpy change is equal to the energy change per polymer monomer-solvent interaction multiplied by the number of such interactions :\\\\Delta H_m = N_1\\\\phi_2z\\\\Delta w\\\\, The polymer-solvent interaction parameter chi is defined as :\\\\chi_{12} = z\\\\Delta w/kT \\\\, It depends on the nature of both the solvent and the solute, and is the only material-specific parameter in the model. The enthalpy change becomes :\\\\Delta H_m = k T N_1\\\\phi_2\\\\chi_{12} \\\\, Assembling terms, the total free energy change is :\\\\Delta G_m = RT[\\\\,n_1\\\\ln\\\\phi_1 + n_2\\\\ln\\\\phi_2 + n_1\\\\phi_2\\\\chi_{12}\\\\,] \\\\, where we have converted the expression from molecules N_1 and N_2 to moles n_1 and n_2 by transferring the Avogadro constant N_A to the gas constant R = kN_A. The value of the interaction parameter can be estimated from the Hildebrand solubility parameters \\\\delta_a and \\\\delta_b :\\\\chi_{12} = V_{seg}(\\\\delta_a - \\\\delta_b)^2/RT \\\\, where V_{seg} is the actual volume of a polymer segment. In the most general case the interaction \\\\Delta w and the ensuing mixing parameter, \\\\chi, is a free energy parameter, thus including an entropic component. This means that aside to the regular mixing entropy there is another entropic contribution from the interaction between solvent and monomer. This contribution is sometimes very important in order to make quantitative predictions of thermodynamic properties. More advanced solution theories exist, such as the Flory‚ÄìKrigbaum theory.  Liquid-liquid phase separation  Polymers can separate out from the solvent, and do so in a characteristic way. The Flory-Huggins free energy per unit volume, for a polymer with N monomers, can be written in a simple dimensionless form f=\\\\frac{\\\\phi}{N}\\\\ln\\\\phi+(1-\\\\phi)\\\\ln(1-\\\\phi)+\\\\chi\\\\phi(1-\\\\phi) for \\\\phithe volume fraction of monomers, and N\\\\gg 1. The osmotic pressure (in reduced units) is \\\\Pi=\\\\phi/N -\\\\ln(1-\\\\phi)-\\\\phi-\\\\chi\\\\phi^2. The polymer solution is stable with respect to small fluctuations when the second derivative of this free energy is positive. This second derivative is f = \\\\frac{1}{N\\\\phi}+\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\phi}-2\\\\chi and solution first becomes unstable then this and the third derivative f = -1/(N\\\\phi^2)+1/(1-\\\\phi)^2are both equal to zero. A little algebra then shows that the polymer solution first becomes unstable at a critical point at \\\\chi_{CP}\\\\simeq 1/2+N^{-1/2}+\\\\cdots ~~~~~~~~ \\\\phi_{CP}\\\\simeq N^{-1/2}-N^{-1}+\\\\cdots This means that for all values of 0<\\\\chi\\\\lesssim 1/2 the monomer-solvent effective interaction is weakly repulsive, but this is too weak to cause liquid/liquid separation. However, when \\\\chi> 1/2, there is separation into two coexisting phases, one richer in polymer but poorer in solvent, than the other. The unusual feature of the liquid/liquid phase separation is that it is highly asymmetric: the volume fraction of monomers at the critical point is approximately N^{-1/2}, which is very small for large polymers. The amount of polymer in the solvent- rich/polymer-poor coexisting phase is extremely small for long polymers. The solvent-rich phase is close to pure solvent. This is peculiar to polymers, a mixture of small molecules can be approximated using the Flory-Huggins expression with N=1, and then \\\\phi_{CP}=1/2 and both coexisting phases are far from pure.

(1989‚Äì1995) and Wowowee (2005‚Äì2010), staying on air for 4 years, 2 months and 22 days (as \\"Magandang Tanghali Bayan\\" from 1998‚Äì2003). Other MTB incarnations such as Masayang Tanghali Bayan and MTB Ang Saya Saya stayed on air for around one year each, before Wowowee eventually took over. Overall though, MTB was the longest running daily noontime show of ABS-CBN until It's Showtime (which originally aired as a morning talent variety show and moved to the noontime slot in 2012) surpassed its run in 2019 in the 12:00PM time slot. The total run of It's Showtime (which includes its pre-afternoon years) has already broken MTB's record three years prior. History =Magandang Tanghali Bayan (1998‚Äì2003)= As ABS-CBN decided to cancel \\"'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila\\", the management decided to produce 2 noontime variety shows, one airing daily and one airing weekly. The new daily noontime show Magandang Tanghali Bayan started premiering on November 30, 1998, airing from 12:00nn to 1:30pm, Philippine time. The weekly noontime show, APO Hiking Society's \\"Sabado Live\\" occupied the Saturday timeslot. Original hosts of \\"MTB\\" are Randy Santiago, John Estrada, Willie Revillame, Christine Jacob- Sandejas (now with CNN Philippines), Roderick Paulate, Vanessa del Bianco and Amy Perez. The show aired live from Studio 3 of ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center. This marks the return of Christine Jacob to ABS-CBN since she left when she was a co-host of now rival Eat Bulaga! which moved from the network to the rival GMA Network in 1995. The show assumed most of the segments and staff from its predecessor \\"'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila\\" during its first season. Among the most popular segments from APO's previous noontime show was \\"Calendar Girl\\", a daily pageant where pretty and sexy young girls 15‚Äì21 years of age participate in the talent and question and answer portions hosted by Estrada, Santiago and Revillame. To continue the chronology of the pageant (where monthly winners from January to December of the previous year converge to compete in the Grand Finals of following year), management decided to include the January‚ÄìNovember monthly winners from the defunct \\"APO\\" show in the \\"MTB\\" grand coronation that happened on January 2, 1999. In December 1998, \\"Pera o Bayong\\" (Money or Basket) debuted on TV as \\"MTB\\"'s highlight game portion. The engaging elimination round and the suspense-filled jackpot round won the hearts of most televiewers. It gave \\"MTB\\" better overall ratings than 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila, and the show even overtook GMA's Eat Bulaga! as the top weekday noontime variety show from early 1999 until Revillame's ouster in 2001. This led the management to cancel Sabado Live! on Saturday timeslot and replace it with \\"MTB\\"'s Saturday edition, which started to air on March 6, 1999. Well-known TV director Edgar \\"Bobot\\" Mortiz started handling directorial chores for the show along with newcomer Bobet Vidanes. \\"MTB\\" also had its share of controversies. The \\"Calendar Girl\\" portion became notorious for the main hosts' green jokes which subsequently got warnings from MTRCB (then headed by veteran actress Armida Siguion-Reyna). Eventually, the ABS-CBN management intervened and suspended the three main hosts indefinitely. With their suspension in August 1999, the show was temporarily replaced by \\"Esep- Esep\\" for a week. Estrada, Santiago and Revillame came back with a bang after their suspension a week later. In the year 2000, the phenomenal game portion \\"Pera o Bayong\\" faced stiff competition from Eat Bulaga! when the long-running noontime show produced a segment called \\"Meron o Wala\\" (Something or Nothing). But despite the move from the rival show, \\"Pera o Bayong\\" still continued to enthrall viewers. The popular catchphrases coined by the hosts eventually became part of the Filipino pop culture. Because of its immense popularity, \\"Pera o Bayong\\" was made into a movie version (\\"Pera o Bayong not da TV)\\" by Star Cinema that year, with the whole \\"MTB\\" cast included. Changes were suddenly made after the February 7, 2001 episode, when main host Willie Revillame was axed from the show after citing creative differences between him and the staff. Matinee idols Marvin Agustin, Dominic Ochoa and Rico Yan (collectively known as \\"Whattamen\\") replaced him on the show. Top-notch stand- up comedians Marissa Sanchez and Ai-Ai delas Alas also joined as new female co-hosts. \\"MTB\\" also started doing out-of-town shows abroad during the same year to promote ABS-CBN's international channel TFC. In March 2002, \\"MTB\\" lost a co-host, Rico Yan, who died during his Lenten vacation in Dos Palmas Resort, Palawan. The show aired a week-long tribute for him. That same year, the show introduced new faces to join the growing \\"MTB\\" family. The quintet Power Boys, the dance group G-Girls, morning traffic angel Pia Guanio and upcoming teen star Maoui David were among those that joined in the fun and that time, Christine Jacob-Sandejas left the show to focus on her family, while original mainstay Gary Lim was also relieved from the show to let him focus on his acting career. During the 4th anniversary of the show on November 2002, the show underwent a major revamp with new game portions and some established ABS- CBN stars (Judy Ann Santos, Edu Manzano, Ryan Agoncillo) co-hosting on a weekly basis. By this time, the show had lost its luster in the ratings game to \\"Eat Bulaga!\\" following the rising popularity of the reality portion \\"Sige Ano Kaya Mo?\\" and creating new sensations out of the Sexbomb Dancers. \\"Magandang Tanghali Bayan\\" ended its four-year run on February 21, 2003 to give way to Willie Revillame's TV comeback on the noontime slot. The title of the replacement show (\\"Masayang Tanghali Bayan\\") and Willie's co-hosts (among them Randy Santiago and John Estrada) were not revealed until 12:00nn of February 22, 2003. =Masayang Tanghali Bayan (2003‚Äì2004)= Prior to the start of the show, ABS-CBN drummed up month-long promotions for the show where they only revealed Willie Revillame, the JaBoom Twins and Cindy Kurleto as mainstays and had the audience guess the rest of his co-hosts thru a nationwide raffle promo. The title of the show was also kept under wraps as well. It was on the initial telecast on February 22, 2003 when Willie Revillame revealed the title \\"Masayang Tanghali Bayan\\" and his co-hosts thru an elaborate opening number. He was joined by Randy Santiago, John Estrada, Dennis Padilla, Ai-Ai delas Alas, Bayani Agbayani, Mickey Ferriols and Aubrey Miles. Resident comedians Tado and Bentong also came on board as well. The show was directed by ace TV director Johnny Manahan. The show had more game portions giving out big cash prizes thru \\"Super Jack en Poy\\" and \\"Urong Sulong\\" which gives out P2 million as the highest possible jackpot prize. It was also touted as the biggest noontime show of ABS-CBN, with a simultaneous airing on the Kapamilya Network's UHF channel, Studio 23. Like its predecessor, the second version of \\"MTB\\" also courted controversy when John Estrada and Willie Revillame were suspended because of delivering their usual green jokes during the \\"Super Jack en Poy\\" jackpot round. The show's family also grew with the inclusion of former Kapuso comedians Long Mejia and Dagul. However before 2003 was about to end, Willie Revillame resigned from the show after a public outcry when he delivered a derogatory joke on midget co-host Mahal during her birthday. The show continued to air until February 2004 with comedian Vhong Navarro and actor-host Edu Manzano taking over Willie's place. However, \\"Masayang Tanghali Bayan\\" failed to sustain viewership and was given the axe on February 20, 2004. =MTB Ang Saya Saya (2004‚Äì2005)= The ABS-CBN management capitalized on Ai-Ai delas Alas' rising popularity following her box-office triumph in Star Cinema's Ang Tanging Ina. She was named the main host, together with Edu Manzano and former GMA 7's resident game show host Arnell Ignacio in the third incarnation of MTB. Mickey Ferriols and Tado were also retained from the former show, and were joined by the Viva Hot Babes, and newcomers BJ Manalo, Jeni Hernandez and Empoy. MTB Ang Saya Saya premiered on February 21, 2004 with more reality based talent search segments launched. TV Idol (You're the Man!) gained popularity among the viewers and gave birth to the showbiz careers of Ahron Villena, AJ Dee and JE Estrada. The show also made household names out of Joross Gamboa, Roxanne Guinoo and Sandara Park fresh from their winning stints in the reality show Star Circle Quest. However, these efforts were overshadowed by rival \\"Eat Bulaga!\\" which celebrated its 25th anniversary on television with a Silver Special. On November 15, 2004, MTB Ang Saya Saya lost its prime 12:00nn slot to Kris Aquino's Pilipinas, Game Ka Na Ba? and started airing as an afternoon variety show on a 1:00pm time slot. Soon after, main host Edu Manzano resigned on January 2005 to concentrate on his duties as chairman of the Optical Media Board (OMB). The show ended on February 4, 2005 and was replaced by Wowowee, hosted by Willie Revillame, who made his third comeback on the ABS-CBN noontime slot due to public clamor. In January 2011, ABS-CBN announced through its Push.com site that a new noontime show, hosted by ex-MTB hosts Santiago and Estrada as well as Toni Gonzaga and ex-Wowowee host Mariel Rodriguez, was in the works.http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/01/27/11/abs-cbn-brews- new-noontime-show-toni-mariel However, the new noontime show is called Happy Yipee Yehey!, which it premiered on February 12, 2011. Segments =Pera o Bayong= Pera o Bayong became one of the more popular segments on MTB. The game's concept came from another Philippine TV show Kwarta o Kahon (Cash or Box) which aired Sundays on RPN. The original version of the game started with 50 players answering a series of multiple choice questions (A, B, C, or D), hoping to eliminate all others until only one remains. The most popular type of question involved the scientific names of plants and animals, with at least two of the four choices noticeably joke answers. If two people remain in the game and both choose the correct answer, the first person to arrive at his/her choice is declared the winner. The winner of the elimination round then moves on to the jackpot round where he or she begins by choosing one of three bayongs marked M, T, or B (for the show's title). Each bayong contain a concealed piece of cardboard on which is written what the contestant in playing for. There is a bargaining session when the host (usually Willie Revillame) would offer cash (pera) in exchange for the contestant abandoning the prize hidden in the bayong. After each offer, Amy Perez and Dick Paulate lead the crowd in asking \\"Pera O Bayong?\\" and the contestant declares his or her choice. The number of bargaining sessions vary from day to day, depending on the mood/emotional status of both the host and the contestant. The prizes in the bayong would range from nothing, to 1 million pesos, to a house and lot, to a showcase of the day, to a tricycle, to a car, to fruits and vegetables (e.g. Watermelon), to various cheaper objects. In its early days, the prize that was inside the chosen bayong was revealed to the audience during the sessions. Sometimes family members went to a TV inside the cafeteria at the ABS-CBN studios to see what the prize was, then try to influence the crowd to beg for the contestant to take whatever was in the bayong. After this was discovered the TV was switched off during the round. Later the prize was not revealed to anyone until it was actually opened. After the cancellation of MTB, an improved version of Pera o Bayong debuted as a part of Wowowee, retitled \\"Bigtime\\" Pera o Bayong. This segment is also played in Happy Yipee Yehey!, with the same name. The winner of the elimination round then moves on to the jackpot round where he or she begins by choosing one of 7 bayongs Each bayong contain a Contains 1 Or 0 Places on which is written what the contestant in playing for. This segment is brought back as a digital game show on the Kumu app, produced by ABS-CBN Regional. =Calendar Girl= A pageant contest for beautiful girls aged 15 to 21 years old. In the daily rounds, contestants paraded the MTB stage wearing a two-piece bikini/swimsuit while the weekly/monthly finals the pageant transforms into a more formal portion, with a grand \\"themed\\" opening number featuring contestants in various costumes, but still retaining the swimsuit portion. The grand coronation of \\"Calendar Girls\\" airs usually on the first week of January, featuring all the monthly winners of the past year who will vie for the title. The said portion gained notoriety, where the contestants were subjected to double-meaning questions and jokes thrown by main hosts Randy, John and Willie Revillame. After their suspension, the daily contests was toned down, with the contestants wearing a cloth around their waists to cover the lower portion of their body. =Other segments= Other popular segments included: Sa Pula, Sa Puti (Tanggal ang Mali), Pakita Mo Puppet Mo, Munting Miss U, Super Lolo, Japorms, Mr. Ador-able, Wansa Funny Taym, Sing It, Milenyonaryo and Winner Take All. When the show reformatted in 2002, other segments that made an impact were: Sing Alis, Ano Ka, Hilo?, Oo, Kaya Ko! and MTBGo.

While the former group believed in the use of folklore material for the development of their compositions, the latter believed that the more rational approach of the European school was the path to truly contemporary works.

Bliss's family was of Northamptonshire, England. His grandfather moved to Moray, Scotland. Bliss himself was born in Karachi, India (but now in Pakistan). Bliss was raised in Edinburgh and educated at George Watson's College from 1906-17\\\\. He always regarded himself as Scottish. Gunhills, Windley, 1946-52, Tate Gallery. Bliss left school in 1917 to join the Highland Light Infantry until the end of World War I. In 1922 he was awarded an M.A. in English Literature by the University of Edinburgh. He had studied Art History in his first year. Bliss then studied painting at the Royal College of Art in London. In his postgraduate year he studied engraving. In 1925 the Oxford University Press published his engravings illustrating Border ballads. Bliss then received a number of commissions, including a commission to write A History of Wood Engraving. This work received such critical acclaim that Bliss‚Äô reputation as an artist was overshadowed by his reputation as a critic and teacher. In 1928 Bliss married Phyllis Dodd, who was a painter. Encouraged by his wife Bliss took up painting again, painting oil and watercolour landscapes in Scotland and England. Coincidentally his paintings record the end of an era of small-holding. He also painted some urban scenes just before the towns were transformed by high rise and high-density buildings. In the 1930s Bliss established the Blackheath Society, which continues today to attempt to protect the amenity of life in south-east London. In the 1930s he taught at the Blackheath School of Art and was the London art critic for The Scotsman. In 1941 Bliss joined the RAF and was stationed in Scotland. After the war, the war he was appointed Director of the Glasgow School of Art. He referred to Glasgow as \\"the greatest industrial city in the Empire\\". Bliss was instrumental in saving much of the Art Nouveau architecture and furniture of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. He continued as Director from 1946 until 1964. When he completed his period as Director, Glasgow School of Art was listed by Whitaker's Almanack among the six top Art Schools in Britain. Bliss's own art was exhibited around Britain. There was an exhibition of his work in the Glasgow School of Art, in the northern hemisphere summer of 1998. Much of the work of Bliss's youth has been lost. Most of his engravings were unpublished before the beginning of the War in 1939 and his entire collection was stolen during the Blitz. Decades later sixteen degraded blocks were identified at an auction. Most split when printing was attempted.

Its co-ordinates are Geography Macauley Island is the second-largest of the Kermadec islands (after Raoul Island), and covers an area of , including neighbouring Haszard Island, which is to the east and about in area. The island's topography is simple, being a single high-sided plateau, with the soft rock of the island prone to the formation of deep water channels.\\"Islands \\", thekermadecs.org. Retrieved 18 November 2014. Macauley's highest point is Mount Haszard, and it forms part of the rim of a caldera centred to the north-west, atop a large submarine volcano. The volcano's last eruption was in 4360 BC ¬± 200 years, and was one of the largest known eruptions of the past 10,000, listed as VEI 7. History Polynesians are known to have visited the island, as evidenced by an obsidian flake found here whose source could be geochemically traced to Mayor Island / Tuhua, off Tauranga, New Zealand. Lieutenant John Watts, RN was the first European to visit Macauley and Curtis Islands ‚Äî which he named after patrons George Mackenzie Macaulay, a London merchant and alderman and friend of, and William Curtis part owner of The Lady Penrhyn along with his brother Timothy ‚Äî on the Lady Penrhyn in the late 1788.Curtis was described on Sunday 1 June 1788 but not landed on as it appeared barren.

A castaway depot was established on Macauley Island in 1889, which was regularly serviced until 1918. Flora and fauna The island is a breeding site for large numbers of black-winged and white-necked petrels. Other seabirds recorded as breeding there include grey noddies, sooty terns, masked boobies, red-tailed tropicbirds, wedge-tailed shearwaters, Kermadec little shearwaters, Kermadec petrels and Kermadec storm-petrels. The island also holds a population of the Kermadec red-crowned parakeet. Former populations of goats and kiore have been eradicated.Greene et al. (2004). The island forms part of the Kermadec Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it is an important site for nesting seabirds.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Kermadec Islands. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2012-02-03. The island's flora is predominantly sedges and ferns, with Cyperus and Hypolepis prominent. Conservation The original forest cover of the island had been burnt off and goats were introduced as food for shipwreck survivors. The goats were eradicated by the New Zealand Wildlife Service in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The film stars Ewen Leslie, Chris Haywood, Saskia Burmeister, and Nicholas Eadie. It won the 2005 Australian Film Institute Awards for Best Short Fiction Film, Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay in a Short. Plot The film tells of a young Orthodox Jewish man's struggle after the death of his father. The young man returns from Israel to find that he would prefer to leave Orthodoxy, and departs from his remaining family to become a taxi driver. He gradually assimilates into secular life, soon finding himself tempted to fornicate. The film appears to mimic the Parable of the Prodigal Son, with the main character appearing to reconsider Orthodox life at the end of the film by reuniting with his family.

The original terminus station was opened in 1834 for the Leeds and Selby Railway. The Hull and Selby Railway extended the line in 1840, and a new station was built, with the old station becoming a goods shed. The station was rebuilt in 1873 and 1891, the 1891 rebuilding being required due to the replacement of the swing bridge over the Ouse at the same time. The area around the station has been the location for the junctions of a number of lines, including the former East Coast Main Line route between Doncaster and York, as well as the Selby to Driffield Line (1848), and the Selby to Goole Line (1910). After 1983 with the opening of the Selby Diversion Selby is no longer on the East Coast Main Line. As of 2014 lines lead from Selby to Leeds, Hull and Doncaster. The station is managed by TransPennine Express, and receives regional trains operated by Northern and TransPennine Express, as well as Hull-London services operated by Hull Trains and London North Eastern Railway. History =1834 station= Original Leeds and Selby station, now warehousing (2013) In 1834 the Leeds and Selby Railway opened, running east west from a terminus station in Marsh Lane, Leeds to a terminus at Selby. The line opened 22 September 1834, with only one track complete. A train from Leeds set off at 6 am and arrived in Selby around 9 am, to a general celebration. When general service started the journey took about 65 minutes. The main stations were not completed until a few months after the line opened; the Selby terminus at a cost of ¬£10,300. Both tracks of the line were completed by 15 December 1834. The basic design of the station was of a large warehouse shed, long and wide on a site of around , with a wooden trussed roof of three spans (of approximately 25', 46', and 25') supported via iron brackets on cast iron columns, which were hollow and acted as drainpipes, to collect rain water then stored in underground tanks. Station offices and other buildings were built adjoining the station. The train shed had six lines of track, four for freight and two for passengers. Lines for coal and lime were separate, outside the shed to the east, the offices at the northwest corner. The line of rails continued through the station to a wharf on the River Ouse. Journeys to Hull were completed by Packet boat from Selby. After construction of the new station in 1840, with the connection on the Hull and Selby Railway old station became a goods station. The rail links to the old station were removed in the 1980s. As of 2009 the station is used as warehousing by Viking Shipping Services Ltd. =1840 station= In 1840, the Hull and Selby Railway was opened. To cross the River Ouse, a bascule lifting bridge was installed, northwest of the old station.For details of the 1834 Ouse railway bridge at Selby see Selby swing bridge (1840) At that time ships had priority over railway traffic. The Hull and Selby, and Leeds and Selby railways connected 'end on' at Selby, west of the old station; the Leeds and Selby Line diverged from its old terminus path at a junction near the crossing of Park street; the line of the railway ran a short distance west, and parallel to the track in the original station.Ordnance Survey. Town plans 1:1056 1848 A new through station was built, and the old station became a goods station. =1873 station= In 1871 the NER opened two new sections of track, from Shaftholme junction (4 miles north of Doncaster) to Selby Old West junction (Selby), and from Barlby junction (across the Ouse from Selby) to Chaloner's Whin junction (Dringhouses, York); these formed a new route for the East Coast Main Line. A new station was constructed from between 1870 and 1873, built by Thomas Nelson to a design from Thomas Prosser's office in the NER. =1891 station= North end of Selby station and the swing bridge (1957) In 1891 a new swing bridge was built downstream (east) of the original over the Ouse (see 1891 Selby swing bridge). The priority of river traffic over rail traffic was reversed on completion of the new bridge; crossings by rail were more than ten times more numerous than river craft. As a consequence of the shift in the path of the railway the old station was rebuilt. The down (west) platforms were retained and modified, whilst the up (east) platforms were moved eastwards, re-using and extending Prosser's platform roof. The architect for the remodelling and extension was the NER's William Bell. =History of rail transport at Selby= In addition to the main lines west to Leeds (Leeds & Selby, 1834), east to Hull (Hull & Selby, 1840), and north and south to York and Doncaster (York & Doncaster branch, 1871), the rail system at Selby was the location for a number of junctions to other lines, and other facilities. A branch from the Hull line (near Barlby to Market Weighton) opened in 1848. (see Selby and Market Weighton Railway) The line ran from Cliffe junction east of the Ouse south of Barlby, around a mile east of Selby.Ordnance Survey Sheet 221 1845-7; 221NE 1889‚Äì90 The Cawood, Wistow and Selby Light Railway (CW&SLR;) was opened in 1898 linking the Leeds & Selby Railway to the village of Cawood. Until 1904 the line had a separate station, Brayton Gates, 1 mile west of Selby. The line was predominantly used for agricultural traffic but also carried passengers until 1930, its final closure taking place in 1960. The Selby to Goole Line opened in 1910, ran via the villages of Barlow, Drax and Rawcliffe to Goole. The line closed in 1964 as a result of the Beeching report. A short section of the line was used to access a ballast tip near Barlow until 1983. In the mid 20th century the 'Loop Line' was converted into a triangle junction by the addition of a short chord between the Selby-Doncaster and Selby-Leeds lines.Ordnance Survey. Sheet 221SE 1938, 1950 In 1983 the Selby Diversion of the East Coast Main Line was opened, avoiding the area around Selby due to possible subsidence from the drift mining works of the Selby Coalfield. As a result, Selby ceased to be a through route on the ECML. The 1871 line from Selby to York was closed on 24 May 1983 and in 1989 was converted into a cycle track which now forms part of route 65 of the National Cycle Network. The line south to Temple Hirst Junction was retained ‚Äì it is in regular use for both passenger & freight traffic and also serves as a diversionary route for Doncaster to Hull services if the line via Goole is closed for any reason. Engine sheds and industrial branches An engine shed was built 1870‚Äì2, in the V of the junction between the lines to Doncaster and Leeds. The shed was a standard NER design roundhouse by Prosser in a square overall shed, with 20 tracks. The shed was extended to a similar extent in 1896‚Äì8 with an adjacent square shed to a design by Bell.Ordnance Survey. Sheet 221SE 1888‚Äì90, 1905 In around 1900 a short \\"Loop Line\\" was built south of the station, altering the path to the Leeds line by forming a junction on the Doncaster line further south, beyond the engine sheds. The original route out of Selby to Leeds became peripheral, part of the sidings associated with the engine sheds. There was also a Canal works (dye and leather chemicals) east of the Doncaster line, on the banks of the Selby Canal, connected by sidings from the mid 20th century.Ordnance Survey. Sheet 221SE 1950 Also on the Selby side of the Ouse were sidings for the gas works, and for a wood yard, and for the 'Ousegate Maltings' as well as accommodation sidings for the Goods shed. Barlby signal box with BOCM mill in background (2007) On the far bank of the Ouse there were industrial sidings: A seed mill north of the line had been established by in 1909 with a rail connection; this developed into a large mill Olympia Mills, later part Jurgens (1919),See also Antoon Jurgens, Antonius Johannes Jurgens and Margarine Unie. Unilever (1929), and BOCM (1952).Ordnance Survey Sheet 221NE 1889‚Äì90, 1905, 1938, 1950 (now part of BOCM Pauls, not rail connected). Also on the far bank a Sugar Beet factory, was rail connected from the south side Hull-Selby line from the mid 20th century. In 1983 the site was acquired by logistics company Potter Group, and redeveloped into a distribution centre including a rail freight terminal and warehousing. Client occupiers include Cemex (Asphalt concrete, using stone from Peak Forest, Derbyshire), and Clipper Logistics (e-commerce clothing/textile logistics). =Station Masters= *Edwin Storey 1866 - 1887 *John Bradford Harper 1888 - 1890 (afterwards station master at York) *Samuel Holliday 1890 - 1892 (afterwards station master at York) *James Brown ca. 1894 - 1897 (afterwards station master at York) *William Bell 1897 - 1910 *J.G.

It is located on the main road into Howick, New Zealand. Howick's war memorial is located in the centre of the remains of the stockade's earthworks which are readily visible today. History The stockade was built in June 1863, for defence of British settlers against the perceived indigenous Maori threat during the New Zealand Land Wars. The site was constructed of loop holed sheets of iron surmounting a ditch and bank, and enclosed barracks for regular troops. The local militia, British Army 70th Regiment and Bavarian mercenaries from Puhoi, camped at the stockade. At one point there were two hundred troops stationed. Women and children slept here at night for several weeks in 1863 when there was fear of attack during the Land Wars. Howick's first resident vicar, Church of England clergyman Reverend Vicesimus Lush wrote of this in his personal diary. Bavarian mercenaries stationed here in 1863 erected a Christmas tree, believed to be the first in New Zealand, and sang carols. 21st century To the south of the hill on the main road can be seen the original concrete road that ran all the way from Howick to Panmure, thus allowing much shorter travel times between Howick and Auckland. Until recently the hill had two large concrete water tanks providing water to Howick. These have now been removed. Each year the ANZAC Day (25 April) parade ends at the top of the hill, where a service is held. At the centre of the old stockade, which is now a public park in which the stockade's perimeter earthworks are easily visible, is the Howick War Memorial, which was unveiled on 13 January 1921.

UK domestic politicians  By the Political Offices Pension Act 1869, pensions were instituted for those who had held political office. For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes: # those with a yearly salary of not less than ¬£5,000; # those with a salary of less than ¬£5,000 and not less than ¬£2,000; # those with a salary of less than ¬£2,000 and more than ¬£1,000. For service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: # a first class pension not exceeding ¬£2,000 a year, in respect of not less than four years service or its equivalent, in an office of the first class; # a second class pension not exceeding ¬£1,200, in respect of service of not less than six years or its equivalent, in an office of the second class; # a third class pension not exceeding ¬£800 a year, in respect of service of not less than ten years in an office of the third class. The service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.  Colonial  These pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio- economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. In the history of the British Empire, the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of princely states who saw their feudal territories annexed by the East India Company before it transferred power in British India to the Crown in 1858. Although politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the Raj a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a gun salute) as well as a monetary \\"political pension\\" in the form of a privy purse. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation. Muslim pensioners : * the imperial Mughal family, Paramount ruler of India as Padshah-i-Hind, in or near Delhi (pension discontinued after 1857) * the heirs of its failed Muslim fundamentalist challenger, Tippu Sultan's Mysore-based Khudadad empire * the Prince of Arcot (formerly Nawab Subadar of the Realm of the Carnatic) * the Nawab of Awadh (Oudh), formerly the Mughal emperor's hereditary prime Minister * the Nawab of Kurnool * the Nawab of Masulipatam, head of a younger branch of the nawabs of Banganapalle * the Nawab of Murshidabad (in fact the dynasty of the former Nawab Nazim of greater Bengal; in West Bengal) * the Nawab of Surat Seven Hindu thrones, at least three held by the Rajput Bhonsle family : * the Maharaja of Assam (not the whole present constitutive state) * the Maharaja of Nagpur * the Raja of Kolaba, Angria (Angre) dynasty * the Raja of Satara, had even earlier lost all real power to his chief minister, the Peshwa, who had become the hegemon of the Mahratta confederation * the Raja of Tanjore * the Raja of Coorg * the Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy (pension discontinued 1857) Only one Sikh pensioner : * Punjab's last ruling Maharajah, Duleep Singh.  Other  Similar 'golden cage' arrangements were often made later by other (not only British) governments. An extreme case was the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, for whom the Italian island of Elba was turned into an operetta 'empire' until his escape, Cent Jours revolt and miserable banishment to St. Helena.
