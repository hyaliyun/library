More generally, the museum is dedicated to the history of the twentieth century, mainly focused on the fragility of peace. Its intention is \\"pay a tribute to the martyred city of the liberation\\" but also to tell \\"what was the terrible story of the 20th century in a spirit of reconciliation\\".  Site  The building and grounds are located in the northern suburbs of the city of Caen on the site of an old blockhouse. The architect was Jacques Millet and the original curator was Yves Degraine. On entrance of the building is written: \\"The pain broke me, the fraternity relieved me, of my wound sprang a river of freedom\\" (sentence by Paul Dorey, local poet who speaks in the name of Normandy). In front of the entrance, we can see the flags of the main nations involved in the Battle of Normandy, and \\"Non-violence\\", a sculpture by Swedish artist Carl Fredrik Reutersw√§rd. The memorial is dedicated to the history of violence and intensive, outstanding conflicts in the 20th Century and particularly World War II. The museum was officially opened on June 6, 1988 (the 44th anniversary of D-Day) by the French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand. The original building deals primarily with World War II, looking at the causes and course of the conflict. The museum was subsequently extended: * In 1991 a gallery dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize was added * Three memorial gardens, The American Garden, The British Garden and the Canadian Garden were dedicated to the three main allied nations involved in liberating France * An extension focusing on the Cold War and the search for Peace was opened by President Jacques Chirac in 2002. It comprises neutralized warheads, planes and a fragment of the Berlin Wall.

Led by Francis Leopold McClintock aboard the steam yacht , the expedition spent two years in the region and ultimately returned with the only written message recovered from the doomed expedition. McClintock and crew were awarded the Arctic medal in recognition of their achievements.  Preparation  When John Rae reported that found artifacts and Inuit testimony placed the death of final members of Franklin's lost expedition near Back's Great Fish River in 1850, Lady Jane Franklin called for an expedition to locate these remains. A secondary goal was to secure any possible claim by Franklin as to discovery of the Northwest Passage. To be led by McClintock, who had participated in the Arctic explorations of Sir John Ross, Horatio Austin and Henry Kellett, it was the fifth expedition privately financed by Franklin's widow, as by this time the British government had abandoned any hopes of rescue. Lady Franklin purchased the 177 ton Fox in April 1857, after other efforts to secure a vessel failed.  Expedition  With an experienced crew of 25, the Fox set sail from Aberdeen on 1 July 1857, after extensive refitting and external sheathing suitable for Arctic service. Inuit interpreter Carl Peterson, who had served under Elisha Kent Kane, was included. They quickly stocked provisions, including lemon juice to prevent scurvy. The government provided additional equipment and arms. They briefly put ashore to several ports on Greenland, sending home an ailing crewman and obtaining coal, dogs, provisions, and Inuit guides Anton Christian and Samuel Emanuel. They set out again in early August and soon encountered icebergs off Disco Bay, reaching Melville Bay on 12 August. = First winter = The ice gradually closed in on the Fox in just a few days, the ship making small advancements with much effort. Some seal hunting provided sport and extended their sled dog's rations as they drifted with the pack through August. By mid-September, they were slowly drifting west among the approaching icebergs, still hoping for liberation to Upernavik, but on 18 September, they began to prepare the ship for winter. Wildlife, including birds, seals, narwhal and polar bears provided hunting as the crew settled into the winter monotony. The ship's surgeon, Dr. Walker, conducted schooling for the crew, and a successful November bear hunt produced a skin that was to be presented to Lady Franklin. The seasonal darkness settled in. December began with the death of a crewman, stoker Robert Scott, who succumbed to injuries following a fall down a hatchway. His remains were committed to the deep on 4 December. Temperatures averaged below while the crew practiced the construction of snow huts. The returning daylight improved morale as February 1858 progressed and the icebergs began to spread out. By mid-March, open lanes of water had begun to appear, but despite several efforts to free the ship, the Fox was held by the ice until 26 April. They had been held by the ice for 242 days. = Arctic summer = Two days later, they were safely anchored at Holsteinborg, Greenland, where their health, spirits and provisions were restored until their departure on 10 May. They remained in the area of Upernavik, attempts at advancement forestalled by the remaining pack ice. By July, their progress improved as open leads in the ice presented themselves. Supplies were supplemented by regular hunting of polar bear, seal, reindeer and various birds. Meetings and barter with Inuit, emboldened by previous contact with European explorers, occurred throughout the summer. However, no information regarding Franklin was obtained, although they had some recollection of other explorers, including John Rae. By August, the Fox was steaming towards Beechey Island, known to have been Franklin's first winter encampment in 1845‚Äì1846. They arrived on 11 August, the once desolate site now including a depot house and several small boats. Letters left previously at the site were taken aboard. On Beechey, McClintock placed a stone monument to Franklin and his crew, provided by Lady Franklin and constructed by Henry Grinnell, before departing on 16 August. Through Barrow Strait, the Fox passed the same waters that held the Enterprise and Investigator nine years earlier during the McClure Arctic Expedition. Bellot Strait was explored as the ship probed the westward ice, already anticipating the onset of winter. Caches of provisions were made on shore in anticipation of separate explorations in the coming spring. By 28 September, they had pushed to their wintering place off of Point Kennedy. The ship was prepared for winter once again, and a magnetic observatory was built. = Second winter = By November, the crew had again settled into winter habits, occasionally hunting and brewing sugar beer. Dogsled exploration and depot parties braved drifting ice and temperatures of . On 7 November, the ship's engineer George Brands died suddenly, presumably from apoplexy, and was buried on shore. Temperatures reached as animals became scarce and winds became fierce. No regular schooling was conducted, although several crewmembers busied themselves by studying navigation. The new year was welcomed amid improvised celebrations below deck. By February, animals began to return with the increasing sunlight. One member of the crew came down with scurvy, as he had avoided the preserved meats.  Discoveries  = Traces of Franklin = Discovery of the remains The sled dogs were separated into three teams as land parties‚ÄîMcClure, Young, and Walker‚Äîdeparted to extend the search on 17 February, with temperatures no less severe. McClintock's dogs experienced much difficulty with the journey, and the planned trip was shortened. Nights were passed in snow huts. On 2 March, they were surprised to encounter four Inuit returning from a seal hunt. One of them wore a naval button that came, he said, from a group of Europeans who had starved near a river ‚Äì Franklin's last survivors, as confirmed by John Rae in 1854. Another had met with Rae's expedition in the same area. The next day, the entire 45 members of this group of Inuit arrived. McClintock purchased all of the Franklin relics they possessed, mostly silverware and buttons. While none of the natives had seen Franklin's crew alive, several had seen their remains. Some told of a group of survivors from a three-masted ship crushed by the ice west of King William Island, placing them in the same area as described by Rae. McClure's party returned to the Fox with this evidence on 14 March, having travelled some and charting of new coast. Young's party had already returned to the ship without major discoveries. Walker's team, sent to retrieve cached provisions, returned without success on 25 March. On April 2, McClintock finally set out for King William Island to followup on the Inuit reports, with a plan to divide his company into two teams to more quickly explore the island ‚Äì Lieutenant Hobson would lead one party to explore the north coast of King William Island, and McClintock himself would lead one along the southern shore. On April 20, McClintock encountered another group of Inuit. In addition to providing extensive relics, they described two ships near King William's Island. One of the ships had sunk in deep water, while the other was broken upon the ice with one body aboard. They described the European survivors making for the \\"large river\\" with boats in the fall of that year, many falling on the way. The following winter, their bones had been found. Following their directions, a skeleton was located on the route on 24 May, confirmed as a crewman by the remaining garments. He appeared to have died where he fell on the journey. = Final communications = The final Franklin communication Discovery of the cairn Meanwhile, near Cape Jane Franklin, the sledge party led by Lieutenant Hobson located the first written communication recovered from Franklin's Expedition inside a message cairn (note that the date of wintering at Beechey has been attributed to error): Handwritten around the margin of this communication was the following: > 25th April 1848 HMShips Terror and Erebus were deserted on the 22nd April 5 > leagues NNW of this having been beset since 12th Sept 1846. The officers and > crews consisting of 105 souls under the command of Captain F. R. M.

Crozier Captain & Senior Offr > And start on tomorrow 26th for Backs Fish River [signed] James Fitzjames > Captain HMS Erebus Signed by Captains Crozier and Fitzjames, it also states \\"and start (on) to- morrow, 26th, for Back's Fish River,\\" and documents the position of original placement at Sir James Ross's pillar. At this point, Franklin's crews were likely retreating for their lives. McClintock, a few days behind Hobson, continued searching the area for additional clues, which included the discovery of a large boat that had been prepared for river use, fastened to a large sledge. The boat contained the skeletal remains of two men and an extensive collection of objects that would have little value in an Arctic crossing. In exploring Back Bay into June, Hobson also found a cairn with a second note left by Lieutenant Gore in May 1847, its content similar to the first. More abandoned equipment surrounded the cairn, the most interesting of which were taken. These sites appear to have been untouched by the natives, and no part of a ship was seen. Amid melting ice, McClintock reached the Fox on 19 June. Hobson had arrived five days earlier, unable to walk from his ordeal, but recovered on ship. Young had also returned earlier, similarly impaired by the harsh conditions, but had set out again. A few members of the crew had developed signs of scurvy, and Thomas Blackwell, the man who first contracted the disease, had perished of it before McClintock's return. Young returned again on 27 June, having mapped Peel Sound, but finding no traces of Franklin. Preparations for departure were made in July, and a cairn containing detailed records of their efforts was constructed. On 9 August, the ice allowed them to begin steaming out, and despite the loss of their two engineers and dangerous ice, open seas were soon reached. The port of Godhavn on the west coast of Greenland was reached on 29 July, where their Inuit guides were paid and discharged. The Fox made port in London on 21 September 1859, having lost three members of her crew.  Legacy  McClintock and Hobson discovered the last written communications from the last survivors of the Franklin expedition, confirming elements of the history maintained by local Inuit as well as the date of Franklin's own death. McClintock provided the first survey of the west coast of King William's Land. In recognition of his services, he was knighted, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865. McClintock and members of his crew were awarded the Arctic Medal as well. McClintock's observations of persistent pack ice in Victoria Strait confirmed the hopelessness of Franklin's attempts to push south through the unexplored passage.Griffiths, Franklyn (December 31, 1987). Politics of the Northwest Passage. McGill-Queen's Press. p. 31\\\\. . A separate channel to the east of King William Island through James Ross Strait and Rae Strait, sheltered from the pack by the island but unknown to Franklin, might have provided a safe passage to his ships. Roald Amundsen would ultimately achieve the first complete navigation of the Northwest passage via these straits in 1903‚Äì1906. On January 30, 1920, The Pioche Record reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the 1853 McClintock expedition on Melville Island. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.

History Matjiesfontein Station The original inhabitants of the region were the Khoikhoi herders and the San hunter gatherers. Following the arrival of the early European colonists, the area was settled by Afrikaner Trekboers and Griqua people. =Railway origins= The town itself owes its existence to the Cape Government Railways, and to the route that their founder, Cape Prime Minister John Molteno, chose for a railway line that would connect Cape Town's port to the diamond fields of Kimberley. The Royal Commonwealth Society (1898) records that in a meeting with his consulting engineers, the Prime Minister called for a map of Southern Africa to be brought to him and, taking a ruler, drew his pen along it from Cape Town all the way inland. He then handed the map to the engineers, telling them to build the railway accordingly. Royal Colonial Society: Proceedings of the Royal Colonial Institute. Northumberland Avenue, London. 1898. p.26. \\"The Railway System of South Africa\\".C. Schoeman: The Historical Karoo: Traces of the Past in South Africa's Arid Interior. Penguin Random House South Africa. 2013. The line rapidly extended inland, and a station was built on 1 February 1878, that was named \\"Matjiesfontein\\". The name was derived from a type of sedge, Cyperus textilis, used by Khoekhoen to make mats (matjies) employed in the construction of their huts. =Logans refreshment station= Originally, Matjiesfontein was only a small depot and farm, however a Scotsman by the name of James Douglas Logan, who was superintendent of this stretch of railway, bought land at Matjiesfontein, moved there because of his weak chest, and opened a refreshment station for the passing trains. This was so successful that the business soon formed the nucleus of a growing village. Logan was unintentionally very influential in South African history as he had secured the catering contract for the railways through his friend in parliament, James Sivewright, and discovery of the corruption involved led to the fall of the first government of Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes in 1893.Burman, Jose (1984). Early Railways at the Cape. Cape Town. Human & Rousseau, p.58. http://www.oliveschreiner.org/vre?view=personae&entry;=242 Logan was also considered to be one of the founding fathers of South African cricket. =Development and layout= A town was laid out in the 1880s, and formally purchased in 1968 to be preserved for its Victorian charm. The whole town was declared a National Monument on 12 September 1975, the railway station on 15 December 1989 and the cemetery on 23 September 1994. The cemetery houses the graves of British Army Major-General Andrew Wauchope (1846‚Äì1899) and English cricketer George Lohmann (1865‚Äì1901).

History Joe Slovo Park is a small township which was designed to replace the shack settlement of Marconi Beam with an orderly working-class suburb. However it is now barely distinguishable from the informal settlement it was meant to replace. One section of Joe Slovo Park is known as Mshini Wam, named after the struggle song Umshini wami which was often sung by Jacob Zuma in the run up to his election as president. It was founded in 2006 when it was erected in an open space ringed by formal RDP (Reconstruction and Development Programme) houses. Mshini Wam was plagued by fire and flooding. A re-blocking process was started in 2012 which will provide access to emergency services. It was named after Joe Slovo, the anti- apartheid activist and former South African Minister of Housing.

Joe Slovo Park is near Canal Walk an upmarket shopping centre among some of the areas found in Milnerton. Controversies There is great pressure from people wanting to build structures on open pieces of land. In October 2012 this led to protests when the City's Land Anti-Invasion Unit arrived to pull down structures built on city owned land. Again in March 2014 residents of Joe Slovo Park started building an informal settlement on an open piece of land on Freedom Way in front of the Assemblies of God church and Sinenjongo high school. The City of Cape Town had successfully applied for an interdict to prevent further structures being built on this land and when people refused to move the police arrived and dismantled the structures. Later that day the affected community gathered and anger boiled over. The Assemblies of God church was petrol bombed as it was assumed that they were the ones who ordered the demolition. Threats were also made against the principal of Sinenjongo high school, Mrs Nopote. A series of meetings was subsequently held to clarify the situation. Structures have subsequently been rebuilt and this piece of land is now fully occupied by shacks. Facilities a woman in her shack home washing clothes by hand in a plastic container.

Retrieved July 26, 2010. Oil production in Iran (1950‚Äì2012) Iran is an energy superpower and the Petroleum industry in Iran plays an important part in it. In 2004 Iran produced 5.1 percent of the world's total crude oil ( per day), which generated revenues of US$25 billion to US$30 billion and was the country's primary source of foreign currency. At 2006 levels of production, oil proceeds represented about 18.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). However, the importance of the hydrocarbon sector to Iran's economy has been far greater. The oil and gas industry has been the engine of economic growth, directly affecting public development projects, the government's annual budget, and most foreign exchange sources. In FY 2009, the sector accounted for 60 percent of total government revenues and 80 percent of the total annual value of both exports and foreign currency earnings. Oil and gas revenues are affected by the value of crude oil on the international market. It has been estimated that at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota level (December 2004), a one-dollar change in the price of crude oil on the international market would alter Iran's oil revenues by US$1 billion. In 2012, Iran, which exported around 1.5 million barrels of crude oil a day, was the second-largest exporter among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In the same year, officials in Iran estimated that Iran's annual oil and gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015.Mehr News Agency: Iran eyes $250 billion annual revenue in 5 years Retrieved December 22, 2010 However, the industry was disrupted by an international embargo from July 2012 through January 2016. Iran plans to invest a total of $500 billion in the oil sector before 2025.Iran Daily - Domestic Economy - 04/24/08 History =The era of international control, 1901‚Äì1979= Abadan Refinery The history of Iran's oil industry began in 1901, when British speculator William D'Arcy received a concession from Iran to explore and develop southern Iran's oil resources.The exploration in Iran was lead by George Reynolds.The discovery of oil on May 26, 1908 led to the formation in 1909 of the London-based Anglo- Persian Oil Company (APOC). By purchasing a majority of the company's shares in 1914, the British government gained direct control of the Iranian oil industry, which it would not relinquish for 37 years. After 1935 the APOC was called the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). A 60-year agreement signed in 1933 established a flat payment to Iran of four British pounds for every ton of crude oil exported and denied Iran any right to control oil exports. In 1950 ongoing popular demand prompted a vote in the Majlis to nationalize the petroleum industry. A year later, the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq formed the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). A 1953 coup d'√©tat led by British and U.S. intelligence agencies ousted the Mossadeq government and paved the way for a new oil agreement.Kinzer, All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror (John Wiley & Sons, 2003), p.166The Ford Presidency: A History, by Andrew Downer Crain, p.124 In 1954 a new agreement divided profits equally between the NIOC and a multinational consortium that had replaced the AIOC. In 1973 Iran signed a new 20-year concession with the consortium. Beginning in the late 1950s, many of Iran's international oil agreements did not produce the expected outcomes; even those oil companies that managed to extract oil in their designated areas contributed very little to the country's total oil production. By the time of the Islamic Revolution of 1978‚Äì79, the five largest international companies that had agreements with the NIOC accounted for only 10.4 percent of total oil production. During this period, Iran's oil industry remained disconnected from other industries, particularly manufacturing. This separation promoted inefficiencies in the country's overall industrial economy. In 1973, at a time when Iran was the second-largest oil exporter in the world and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War of October 6‚Äì25 was pressurizing the price of oil, the Shah of Iran told the New York Times,Smith, William. D. \\"Price Quadruples for Iranian Crude Oil at Auction\\", New York Times December 12, 1973 \\"Of course the world price of oil is going to rise. ... Certainly! And how ...; You [Western nations] increased the price of wheat you sell us by 300%, and the same for sugar and cement ...; You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us, refined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid to us ...; It's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for oil. Let's say ten times more.\\" =The era of nationalized oil, 1979‚Äìpresent= Arak Petrochemical complex. Isolation and stagnation under Khomeini Following the Revolution, the NIOC took control of Iran's petroleum industry and canceled Iran's international oil agreements. In 1980 the exploration, production, sale, and export of oil were delegated to the Ministry of Petroleum. Initially Iran's post-revolutionary oil policy was based on foreign currency requirements and the long-term preservation of the natural resource. Following the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, however, this policy was replaced by a more aggressive approach: maximizing exports and accelerating economic growth. From 1979 until 1998, Iran did not sign any oil agreements with foreign oil companies. Khatami era Early in the first administration of President Mohammad Khatami (in office 1997‚Äì2005), the government paid special attention to developing the country's oil and gas industry. Oil was defined as inter- generational capital and an indispensable foundation of economic development. Thus, between 1997 and 2004 Iran invested more than US$40 billion in expanding the capacity of existing oil fields and discovering and exploring new fields and deposits. These projects were financed either in the form of joint investments with foreign companies or domestic contractors or through direct investment by the NIOC. In accordance with the law, foreign investment in oil discovery was possible only in the form of buyback agreements under which the NIOC was required to reimburse expenses and retain complete ownership of an oil field. Marketing of crude oil to potential buyers was managed by the NIOC and by a government enterprise called Nicoo. Nicoo marketed Iranian oil to Africa, and the NIOC marketed to Asia and Europe. According to IHS CERA estimate, oil revenue of Iran will increase by a third to USD 100 billion in 2011 even though the country is under an extended period of U.S. sanctions. Post-JCPOA era The signing of the JCPOA in July 2015 by Hassan Rouhani and Javad Zarif with Barack Obama heralded a new era of d√©tente in foreign relations. With it, Iran was allowed to come in from the cold, as it were and once again to sell its oil unencumbered on the world stage. The withdrawal by Donald Trump from the JCPOA in May 2018 was an ill wind for Iran because he decided to re-apply the sanctions regime that had caused such difficulties to Khamenei. For example, the Grace 1 oil tanker was captured near Gibraltar in July 2019 at the request of the US by the armed forces of the UK. The incident was one of several that have been labelled as the 2019 Persian Gulf crisis, but the crisis soon widened to encompass more distant seas where Iranian arms are impotent. In May the Iranian tanker Happiness 1 suffered difficulties near Jiddah. In August the tanker Helm encountered difficulties while transiting the Red Sea, and in October the Iranian tanker Sabiti was attacked by two missiles of unknown origin, again in the Red Sea. The fully laden Sabiti had been destined for the \\"Eastern Mediterranean\\". China is a significant supporter of the Iranian petroleum industry. In 2017, 64% of an export total $16.9 billion with China was labelled \\"crude oil\\". Because the National Iranian Tanker Company cannot defend the product on the oceans, it most often leaves port under the flag of another nation which is able to defend its own interests. The case of a Shanghai-based operator of oil tankers, Kunlun Holdings is illustrative: in early June it was operating with a shipment of Iranian crude oil as the Pacific Bravo before its transponder disappeared on 5 June in the Straits of Malacca. When it reappeared on 18 July, the ship had been relieved of its load and had been renamed to become the Latin Venture. The US, which had warned ports not to offload the $120 million cargo of the Pacific Bravo, was unhappy about the failure of its sanctions regime. Kunlun Holdings is owned by the Bank of Kunlun, which is in turn owned by the (SOE) CNPC. The Bank \\"has long been the financial institution at heart of China-Iran bilateral trade\\".

Market value of Iran's total oil reserves at international crude price of $75 per barrel stands at ~US $10 trillion. In the early 2000s, leading international oil firms from China, France, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom had agreements to develop Iran's oil and gas fields. In 2004 China signed a major agreement to buy oil and gas from Iran, as well as to develop Iran's Yadavaran oil field. The value of this contract was estimated at US$150 billion to US$200 billion over 25 years. In 2009, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) signed a deal with the National Iranian Oil Company whereby the former took ownership of a 70% stake upon promising to pay 90 percent of the development costs for the South Azadegan oil field, with the project needing investment of up to $2.5 billion.

In 2004 pipelines conveyed 69 percent of total refined products; trucks, 20 percent; rail, 7 percent; and tankers, 4 percent. Oil refining produces a wide range of oil products, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, and lubricants. Iran is a net exporter of petroleum products thanks to large exports of residual fuel oil, but the refineries cannot meet domestic demand for lighter distillates such as gasoline. Between 1981 and 2010, domestic consumption of oil products increased from to ‚Äîan average annual growth rate of 3.7 percent. Between 1981 and 2004, consumption of gasoline grew by 6 percent annually, but domestic production met only 75 percent of demand for this product. In 2004 the country imported US$1.6 billion worth of gasoline. By 2006 it imported 41 percent of its gasoline, but by 2010 imports were down to 19.5% of gasoline consumption and heavy investment in new refining capacity may see Iran exporting gasoline by 2015. Refining capacity increased 18% in 2010 and the target is to increase refining capacity to 3.5 million barrels per day. Trade in oil and oil products In 2006 exports of crude oil totaled , or about 62.5 percent of the country's crude oil production. The direction of crude oil exports changed after the Revolution because of the U.S. trade embargo on Iran and the marketing strategy of the NIOC. Initially, Iran's post-revolutionary crude oil export policy was based on foreign currency requirements and the need for long-term preservation of the natural resource. In addition, the government expanded oil trade with other developing countries. While the shares of Europe, Japan, and the United States declined from an average of 87 percent of oil exports before the Revolution to 52 percent in the early 2000s, the share of exports to East Asia (excluding Japan) increased significantly. In addition to crude oil exports, Iran exports oil products. In 2006 it exported of oil products, or about 21 percent of its total oil product output. Iran plans to invest a total of $500 billion in the oil sector before 2025. In 2010, Iran, which exports around 2.6 million barrels of crude oil a day, was the second-largest exporter among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Several major emerging economies depend on Iranian oil: 10% of South Korea's oil imports come from Iran, 9% of India's and 6% of Chinese. Moreover, Iranian oil makes up 7% of Japan's and 30% of all Greek oil imports. Iran is also a major oil supplier to Spain and Italy. In the same year, officials in Iran estimate that Iran's annual oil and gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015 once the current projects come on stream. According to IHS CERA estimate, oil revenue of Iran will increase by a third to USD 100 billion in 2011 even though the country is under an extended period of U.S. sanctions. As of January 2012, Iran exports 22% of its oil to China, 14% to Japan, 13% to India, 10% to South Korea, 7% to Italy, 7% to Turkey, 6% to Spain and the remainder to France, Greece (& other European countries), Taiwan, Sri Lanka, South Africa.Iran's oil exports .

In 2006 annual production reached 105 billion cubic meters, with fastest growth occurring over the previous 15 years. In 2006 natural gas accounted for about 50 percent of domestic energy consumption, in part because domestic gas prices were heavily subsidized.

Between 1979 and 2003, pipelines to transport natural gas to refineries and to domestic consumers increased from 2,000 kilometers to 12,000 kilometers. In the same period, natural gas distribution pipelines increased from 2,000 kilometers to 45,000 kilometers in response to growing domestic consumption. Gas processing plants are located at Ahvaz, Dalan, Kangan, and Marun, in a corridor along the northern Persian Gulf close to the major gas fields. South Pars, Iran's largest natural gas field, has received substantial foreign investment. With its output intended for both export and domestic consumption, South Pars is expected to reach full production in 2015. However, delays and lower production in the Iranian side due to sanctions is resulting in migration of gas to the Qatari part and a loss for Iran.Bahman Aghai Diba: Is Qatar plundering Iran's share in the South Pars joint gas field? .

The share of natural gas in household energy consumption, which averaged 54 percent in 2004, was projected to increase to 69 percent by 2009. Overall, natural gas consumption in Iran was expected to grow by more than 10 percent per annum between 2005 and 2009. With international oil prices increasing and projected to continue increasing, international demand for natural gas and investment in production and transportation of natural gas to consumer markets both increased in the early 2000s. Iran set a goal of increasing its natural gas production capacity to 300 billion cubic meters by 2015 while keeping oil production stable. To achieve this capacity, the government has planned a joint investment worth US$100 billion in the oil and gas industry through 2015. Market value of Iran's total natural gas reserves at comparative international energy price of $75 per barrel of oil stands at ~US $4 trillion.

In 2004 Iran signed a contract with France and Malaysia for production and export of natural gas and another agreement with European and Asian companies for expansion and marketing of its natural gas resources. In 2005 Iran exported natural gas to Turkey and was expected to expand its market to Armenia, China, Japan, other East Asian countries, India, Pakistan, and Europe. The first section of a new line to Armenia opened in spring 2007, as a much-discussed major pipeline to India and Pakistan remained in the negotiation stage. Among some more recent deals, Switzerland's energy company EGL, signed a 25-year LNG export deal with Iran's National Iranian Gas Export Company on March 17, 2007, reportedly valued at 18 billion. Switzerland will buy 5.5 billion cubic meters of Iranian natural gas each year, beginning in 2011. In April 2007, OMV, the Austrian partially state-owned energy company, signed letters of intent with Iran, worth an estimated $22.8 billion (22 billion euros), for Iran to supply Europe with gas. The United States has expressed strong opposition to both the Swiss and Austrian deals with Iran. The National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) is expected to finalize a natural gas export deal with Pakistan, with exports set to begin in 2011. The gas would be transported through a \\"Peace pipeline\\", worth about $7.4 billion. The plan initially also included exporting gas to India, but negotiations have stalled over pricing. Iran also is discussing a gas production and export deal with Turkey. Under the plan, Turkey would assist in developing Iran's South Pars field in exchange for cash or natural gas. Gas would be shipped from Iran to Turkey and Europe via a new pipeline that Turkey plans to build. Other notable petroleum sector development deals include those with Russia and China. On February 19, 2008, Russian state gas company Gazprom announced a deal to establish a joint venture company to develop the offshore Iranian South Pars gas field. A China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) investment deal, valued at $16 billion, to develop Iran's North Pars gas field and to build a liquid natural gas (LNG) plant, was supposed to be signed on February 27, 2008 but has been delayed. The state- operated National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and CNOOC signed a memorandum of understanding in December 2006 for the project, under which CNOOC would purchase 10 million metric tons per year of LNG for 25 years. Petrochemicals Abadan Petrochemical Complex In the early 2000s, an ambitious state petrochemicals project called for expansion of annual output in that industry from 9 million tons in 2001 to 100 million tons in 2015. Output capacity in 2006 was estimated at 15 million tons. The goal of this expansion is to increase the percentage of Iran's processed petroleum-based exports, which are more profitable than raw materials. In 2005 Iran exported US$1.8 billion of petrochemical products (about one-third of total nonoil exports in that year). Receiving 30 percent of Iran's petrochemical exports between them, China and India were the major trading partners in this industry. Iran's domestic resource base gives it a unique comparative advantage in producing petrochemicals when international crude oil prices rise. The gain has been greatest in those plants that use liquid gas as their main input. For FY 2006, the petrochemical industry's share of GDP was projected to be about 2 percent. Iran plans to invest a total of $500 billion in the oil sector before 2025. Iran's petrochemical industries have absorbed a large amount of private and public investment. In the early 2000s, 43 percent of these investments was financed by Iran's National Petrochemical Company, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Petroleum, which administers the entire petrochemical sector. Another 53 percent is owned by foreign creditors (more than 100 foreign banks and foreign companies), 3 percent by banks, and 1 percent by the capital market. Most of the petrochemical industry's physical capital is imported, and the industry does not have strong backward linkages to manufacturing industries. In 2006 new petrochemical plants came online at Marun and Asaluyeh, and construction began on three others. Iran National Petrochemical Company's output capacity will increase to over 100 million tpa by 2015 from an estimated 50 million tpa in 2010 thus becoming the world' second largest chemical producer globally after Dow Chemical with Iran housing some of the world's largest chemical complexes.

This area is bounded by the Coast Mountains. Taxonomy The wolf was first classed as a distinct subspecies in 1941 by Edward Goldman, who described his specimen as being large with a skull closely resembling that of C. l. pambasileus, and whose fur is generally of a cinnamon-buff colour. This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). Studies using mitochondrial DNA have indicated that the wolves of coastal south-east Alaska are genetically distinct from inland gray wolves, reflecting a pattern also observed in other taxa. They show a phylogenetic relationship with extirpated wolves from the south (Oklahoma), indicating that these wolves are the last remains of a once widespread group that has been largely extirpated during the last century, and that the wolves of northern North America had originally expanded from southern refuges below the Wisconsin glaciation after the ice had melted at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. These findings call into question the taxonomic classification of C. l. nulibus proposed by Nowak. Another study found that the wolves of coastal British Columbia were genetically and ecologically distinct from the inland wolves, including other wolves from inland British Columbia. A study of the three coastal wolves indicated a close phylogenetic relationship across regions that are geographically and ecologically contiguous, and the study proposed that Canis lupus ligoni (Alexander Archipelago wolf), Canis lupus columbianus (British Columbia wolf), and Canis lupus crassodon (Vancouver Island wolf) should be recognized as a single subspecies of Canis lupus. In 2016, two studies compared the DNA sequences of 42,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in North American gray wolves and found the coastal wolves to be genetically and phenotypically distinct from other wolves. They share the same habitat and prey species, and form one of the study's six identified ecotypes ‚Äì a genetically and ecologically distinct population separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects the wolf's preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into. Wolves that prey on fish and small deer in wet, coastal environments tend to be smaller than other wolves.

The Vorkuta Gulag was one of the largest camps in the GULAG system with 73,000 prisoners at its peak in 1951, containing Soviet and foreign prisoners including prisoners of war, dissidents, political prisoners, \\"enemies of the state\\" and common criminals who were used as forced labor in the coal mining works. The Vorkuta Gulag was the site of the Vorkuta uprising in July 1953. History The Vorkuta Gulag was established by Soviet authorities in 1932, on a site in the basin of the Pechora River, located within the Komi ASSR of the Russian SFSR (present-day Komi Republic, Russia), approximately from Moscow and above the Arctic Circle. The city of Vorkuta was established to support the camp, which was constructed to exploit the resources of the Pechora Coal Basin, the second largest coal basin in the Soviet Union. There were approximately 132 sub-camps in the Vorkuta Gulag system during the height of its use in the Soviet prison system. From 1939, Polish prisoners were held at Vorkuta following the Occupation of Poland until the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Vorkuta was then also used to hold German prisoners of war captured on the Eastern Front in World War II as well as criminals, Soviet citizens and those from Soviet-allied countries deemed to be dissidents and enemies of the state during the Soviet era. The Vorkuta uprising occurred at the Vorkuta Gulag in July 1953, when inmates at various camps who were forced to work in the region's coal mines went on strike. The uprising, beginning as a mostly passive walkout, escalated into a strike involving 18,000 inmates across the Vorkuta camp system and lasted for approximately two weeks. On 1 August, the Vorkuta Gulag's camp chief Derevyanko ordered troops to fire at the strikers, resulting in the deaths of at least 53 workers, although estimates vary. The Vorkuta camp was liquidated by order of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs and eventually closed in 1962, but large numbers of Soviet citizens who were former prisoners remained living in Vorkuta, originally due to their former status as enemies of the state, then as a result of their poor financial situation. Memorial, a Russian human rights organization that focuses on recording and publicising the human rights violations of the Soviet Union's totalitarianism,Memorial website estimates that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in the Vorkuta area, 32,000 are former gulag inmates or their descendants.Robert Conquest, Paul Hollander: Political violence: belief, behavior, and legitimation p.55, Palgrave Macmillan;(2008) American prisoners A prison mugshot of Homer H. Cox, a kidnapped American military serviceman held at Vorkuta Gulag, taken in 1949, with his name and personal details written in Russian on his mugshot board A large number of American prisoners who were held by the Soviet Union passed through and/or were held at Vorkuta Gulag during most of the Cold War period. In particular, US military servicemen in Soviet custody were often detained at Vorkuta from the 1940s until as late as the 1980s. A significant proportion of American prisoners fell into Soviet hands towards the end of World War II, between the winter of 1944 and the spring and the summer of 1945, when the Soviet Red Army advanced further westward into Nazi German-occupied Poland and then Germany itself. Americans taken as prisoners of war by the Germans were transferred to large Soviet camps such as Vorkuta before repatriation. Many US servicemen were detained at Vorkuta during the Korean War from 1950 to 1955, mainly US Air Force pilots captured by North Korea and the People's Republic of China. Other US servicemen detained at Vorkuta include those kidnapped by the Soviet military, perhaps with covert help from East German authorities, from the streets of East Berlin during the early part of the Cold War from 1945 up until the 1970s . On 6 September 1949, Homer Harold Cox, an American military policeman assigned to the US Army's 759th Military Police Service Battalion based in West Berlin, was arrested while off-duty in East Berlin within the Soviet occupation zone. Cox was subsequently imprisoned at various Soviet prison-camps and labour-camps, including at Vorkuta Mine No. Four and at Vorkuta Mine No. Seven, throughout his four-year period of captivity in the USSR. On 29 December 1953, Cox was finally repatriated back to the United States via West Berlin along with fellow American prisoner Leland Towers, who served in the US Merchant Marine. However, Cox died from pneumonia just less than one year later on 27 September 1954 in Lawton, Oklahoma John H. Noble, a 31-year-old American civilian from Detroit living in Germany, was imprisoned at Vorkuta during the early-1950s. Noble lived in Dresden, a city in the Soviet occupation zone, and was arrested on fake charges so local Soviet authorities could appropriate his family's camera manufacturing business . Noble was a leading participant in the Vorkuta uprising, but managed to survive the violent crackdown by Soviets. Noble was released in 1955 with several U.S. military captives thanks to the personal intervention of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and wrote two books which described his experiences . Another American military serviceman detained by the USSR at Vorkuta around the same period of time was US Army private William Marchuk of Norristown, Pennsylvania, who was also kidnapped (either by the Soviet military or East German authorities) in East Berlin in 1949, and sent to the Soviet Union shortly afterwards . Few American civilians and military personnel held by the Soviet Union at Vorkuta were ever repatriated back to the United States despite constant (but reduced and downplayed) pressure from the US government, which had actually been aware of the USSR's actions.

Built as a civilian passenger liner in 1939, she was named the MS Prinses Beatrix, after Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, and operated by Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (SMZ) (The Zealand Steamship Company) between Flushing and Harwich, along with her sister ship, MS Koningin Emma. After fleeing to Britain after the German invasion in 1940, she was requisitioned by the British Ministry of War Transport, renamed HMS Princess Beatrix and converted to a troopship at Harland and Wolff's yard in Belfast. During the war her main role was transporting British Commandos, and she participated in the Lofoten Islands Raid and the Dieppe Raid. She had the advantage of a high speed that allowed hit and run operations. Later designated as a landing ship, infantry (medium) she took part in the landings in North Africa, Sicily, Salerno, Anzio, and southern France. In 1946 Princess Beatrix was returned to her owners and continued to operate as ferry from Hook of Holland until 1969, when she was scrapped in Antwerp, Belgium. Construction The MS Prinses Beatrix was ordered by the Zeeland Steamship Company (SMZ) in December 1937 to operate between Vlissingen (Flushing) and Harwich. The keel was laid on 7 May 1938 at the De Schelde shipyard at Vlissingen, and the ship was launched on 25 March 1939 by Prince Bernhard. During sea trials Prinses Beatrix made more than which was more than was contractually agreed. On 19 May 1939 the ship was handed over to the SMZ. It had a gross tonnage of 4,135 tons and was capable of carrying 1,800 passengers. Propulsion was provided by two 2-stroke Sulzer diesel engines with a total output of 12,500 shp. Service history Prinses Beatrix entered service on 3 July 1939, but after the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, was withdrawn, and remained in port. On 10 May 1940 the Germans launched their invasion of the Netherlands, dropping mines in the Schelde estuary, and bombing and strafing shipping. Prinses Beatrix promptly fled, arriving at London on the 15th. =Troop transport= Two days later the British Ministry of War Transport chartered her as a troop transport. She was fitted with \\"degaussing\\" coils as protection against German magnetic mines and sailed with her original civilian crew on board in addition to a Dutch Marine detachment. The ship was ordered to take French troops evacuated to England from Dunkirk back to Brest to continue the fight. She left Plymouth on 2 June and sailed with 2,000 aboard, accompanied by the French corvette Commandant Rivi√®re. They returned the next day, then sailed once more with approximately 1,500 men on board, returning with British troops. In September 1940 Prinses Beatrix was formally taken over by the Admiralty to be converted into an \\"assault ship\\" at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. The upper deck was largely cleared and gravity davits installed enabling six LCAs and two LCM(1)s to be carried, along with 450 troops. Prinses Beatrix was armed with two 12-pounder guns, two 2-pounders, four Hotchkiss 20 mm machine guns, and four .303 cal. machine guns. The ship was commissioned as HMS Princess Beatrix on 22 January 1941 as a special service ship. =Lofoten Raid= Her first major action in her new role was \\"Operation Claymore\\", a raid on the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway. On 22 February 1941 Princess Beatrix arrived at Scapa Flow, where men of 3 Commando boarded, as well as Royal Engineer demolition experts and a contingent of Norwegian troops. The British ships - five destroyers and two troop ships - entered the Vestfjord on the morning of 4 March, and launched their attack. Surprise was complete and there was little resistance. All targets selected were located and destroyed. The troops were embarked by 13.00 hours and within half an hour the British had left. After returning to England Princess Beatrix was used for the training and exercise of Special Forces in Scotland. =South Atlantic= In late 1941 she was selected to join the forces gathered at Freetown, Sierra Leone, for \\"Operation Pilgrim\\", the planned occupation of the Canary Islands, if either the Spanish or the Germans captured Gibraltar. After maintenance at Glasgow Princess Beatrix sailed to Freetown, arriving on 5 October 1941. However, it soon became clear that Franco did not plan to join the Axis, nor was he prepared to allow the German troops free passage through Spain to attack Gibraltar, and the operation was cancelled. On 4 November 1941 the British navy tanker reported that she had been attacked by a German raider, between Natal, Brazil and Freetown. Princess Beatrix was one of the ships sent to search. No German raider was found and the Admiralty assumed that a German U-boat had shot at the tanker. However, on 22 November the was sunk by the British cruiser in the southern Atlantic close to Ascension Island, and on 1 December the cruiser sank the German supply ship Python in the same area. Almost all the crews from both ships were taken aboard German and Italian submarines. The British feared that the Germans would try to land on Ascension and overwhelm the tiny garrison. Princess Beatrix was hurriedly loaded with troops and set sail. However, while en route it was learned that the German crewmen were on their way to Bordeaux and the ship was recalled. On 14 February 1942 Princess Beatrix left Freetown, and returned to England for refitting, after which she was reclassified as a landing ship, infantry (medium). =Dieppe Raid= In April 1942 Princess Beatrix was selected to take part in a raid on the French coast at Dieppe. On the evening of 18 August 1942 a fleet of more than 200 ships sailed across the Channel. Princess Beatrix and the British ship landed men of the South Saskatchewan Regiment on \\"Green Beach\\" to the west of Dieppe at Pourville. However, the raid was not a success, and the losses were high. Princess Beatrix sustained slight damage when she collided with the Invicta during operations. =Invasion of North Africa= After repairs Princess Beatrix was assigned to Training Squadron D based on the Clyde, carrying out exercises with Special Forces and practising the landing of ground troops on enemy beaches. All these exercises were in preparation for the landings in North Africa, \\"Operation Torch\\". On 26 October 1942 Princess Beatrix received troops from the 1st Battalion of the U.S. 6th Armored Infantry Regiment, then joined Convoy KMF-1 for North Africa, landing her troops west of Oran. =The Moonlight Squadron= Princess Beatrix remained in the western Mediterranean, supplying and transporting reinforcements for the First Army. On the evening of Friday, 13 November 1942, Princess Beatrix left Algiers with units of the British 78th Infantry Division for B√¥ne, close to the front line. On the return trip to Algiers she was repeatedly attacked by German aircraft, but made port without damage. Princess Beatrix, her sister ship and the former Burn & Laird Lines ships and became known as the \\"Moonlight Squadron\\" for their preference for operating at night. After the fall of Tunis in May 1943 the ships received a special commendation from the Allied Army Commanders and a letter from the British Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the Commander in Chief of the western Mediterranean. During her time in the Mediterranean Princess Beatrix transported 15,700 men, including a large number of German and Italian POWs while sailing 12,000 miles. =Invasion of Sicily= Princess Beatrix was then attached to the ships of \\"Operation Husky\\", the invasion of Sicily. The ship was attached to Force B and sailed with convoy SBF-1. On board were men of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and a Special Forces group, which were to raid a beach codenamed Bark South. On 16 August 1943 Princess Beatrix participated in a joint Anglo-American landing at Cape Scarletta, code-named \\"Operation Blackcock\\" aimed at Messina. =Operations off Italy = After the Armistice with Italy was announced on 8 September 1943, Allied troops were rushed from north Africa to the Italian mainland and Princess Beatrix made a number of voyages between Brindisi and Taranto. In the following months she was based at Naples. On 29 December 1943 Princess Beatrix was involved in \\"Operation Partridge\\" - a raid at the mouth of the Garigliano River with troops of 9 Commando. During the Anzio landings on 22 January 1944 Princess Beatrix transported men of the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions. Princess Beatrix then sailed to Ferryville, Tunisia, at the end of the month to overhaul her engines. =Operations off France= After operating around Corsica, supporting occupation operations, Princess Beatrix sailed into the Adriatic Sea, and was the one of first ships to enter Ancona, after it was liberated. After a short stay at the east coast Princess Beatrix moved to the other side of the Italy, to transport French Special Forces on attacks on the French Mediterranean coast in \\"Operation Romeo\\". During the invasion of southern France in August 1944 Princess Beatrix was in convoy CR-1, landing French troops at between Hy√®res and Saint-Tropez. Princess Beatrix then sailed for the UK, arriving at the Clyde on 1 September 1944. In her two years in the Mediterranean she had sailed 42,755 miles and transported 26,142 men, including a large number of POWs, participated in eight landing operations with American, British and French troops aboard, without loss. Only one member of the crew was captured, but was promptly liberated, and returned to the ship eight days later. =Indian Ocean= Princess Beatrix operated for a time between the Clyde, Avonmouth and Liverpool before she was decommissioned to be adapted for service in tropical waters at D & W Henderson Ltd., Glasgow. She then sailed to the Indian Ocean, arriving at Trincomalee on 15 July 1945. A few days after the Japanese surrender she then took part in \\"Operation Jurist\\" - the reoccupation of Penang by British Marines. Princess Beatrix then acted as troop transport, sailing to Colombo, and taking French troops to Saigon. On 29 September the ship entered the port of Tanjung Priok to take Dutch women and children from Japanese concentration camps. In early January 1946 she was ordered to return home, arriving at Portsmouth on 15 February. =Return to the Netherlands= Decommissioned the next day, she was disarmed at Greenock, and on 13 April 1946 arrived at her home port of Vlissingen to be returned to the Dutch government. She served as a military transport for a time before being handed back to SMZ, and resumed her original name MS Prinses Beatrix. Post-war shortages of materials and labour meant that it was 31 May 1948 before Prinses Beatrix could return to service, sailing for the first time to Harwich from the Hook of Holland. She remained in service on the same route until 1968, when she was replaced by a new generation of roll-on/roll-off ships. The thirty-year-old Prinses Beatrix was taken out of service and sold for scrap just before the year's end in Antwerp.

The population in 2011 was 1,073,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 47.43 km¬≤. For a time it was the seat of local government in the immediate area between 1395 e 1836. The village is surrounded on the three sides by woodland, much of which is made up by a celebrated forest of pine trees known locally as the \\"pinhal\\": part of the national forest of Portugal. Dense plantations of pine trees lie to the East and the West of the village on higher ground. Linking these is an area of mixed woodland consisting of Cork Oaks, Holm Oaks and vineyards. This area is also on higher ground. The southern flank of the village is marked by the river Raia, beyond which is open pasture and a line of hills that make up the southern side of the river valley. Some 60 metres or so wide, the river hosts international Sport fishing events along its banks at Cabe√ß√£o, attracting teams from across Europe. A little further downstream and approximately 2 km from the centre of the village lies the Gameiro Ecological Park: a wider expanse of water where it's possible to enjoy a number of outdoor activities including camping and canoeing. Integrated into this park is Mora Fluviarium: a building of recognised architectural significance and home to an impressive collection of freshwater aquatic species. Mora Fluviarium is well known within Portugal and continues to attract visitors to Cabe√ß√£o from Portugal and Spain. The centre also enjoys academic and technical links with Lisbon Oceanarium and the University of √âvora and is of significant importance to regional tourism, the ecology of the region and the local economy, particularly to that of the nearby village of Cabe√ß√£o. Municipal Holiday Cabe√ß√£o's municipal holiday coincides with a national holiday on 1 November of each year. History Cabe√ß√£o was founded by the \\"Ordem de Avis\\" and was elevated to the status of \\"Vila\\" (or town) in 1578 by King D. Sebasti√£o, the King of Portugal at that time. The King granted the people of Cabe√ß√£o the right to exploit the natural resources of the pine forest that borders the village, a right that is exercised to this day by villagers collecting pine cones for use as fire lighters and wild asparagus for use in the well-known regional dish known as \\"Migas de Espargos\\". During the late twentieth century the village, like many in rural Portugal, has suffered a decline in population as its inhabitants have moved to the coastal cities to find employment. Others have found work further afield in other European countries such as France. More recently many have found work in the United Kingdom, particularly in the Epsom area. It's not unusual to hear a native of the village speaking English with an accent typical of England's Home Counties. During the summer holidays, many former villagers who are now based elsewhere in Europe return to their Portuguese roots, swelling the population considerably.

It is a Museum Partner of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in RichmondVirginia Museum of Fine Arts and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.About Piedmont Arts  History  Piedmont Arts was founded in 1961 by a group of local artists, including Jessamine Shumate, when the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts encouraged the formation of a statewide network of local chapters.About Piedmont Arts In 1976, E.I. DuPont deNemours Company agreed to lease the group the Lynwood House, a company house named for the first DuPont manager to reside there. The artists subsequently took the name Lynwood Artists and began curating exhibits by regional artists and craftsmen for display in the Lynwood House. In 1976, the group incorporated under the name Piedmont Arts Association and in 1978 assumed the new status of Affiliate of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. In 1981, the heirs of Michael and Purnell Schottland donated the Schottland Estate to Piedmont Arts for use as a permanent facility. This donation led to a capital campaign for renovations. During the campaign Piedmont Arts raised more funds than required for renovations and the excess monies were used to establish an endowment for the organization. In 1995, Piedmont Arts launched its Shared Vision Campaign, which was designed to raise funds to renovate the existing facility and add a new wing featuring gallery space, a classroom and a performance hall. In April 1997, Piedmont Arts held a groundbreaking for the new wing, which opened in April of the following year. In April 2004, Piedmont Arts was awarded accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums after completing a year-long self study.  Visual Arts  Piedmont Arts hosts up to six exhibits per year, featuring work by national and international artists. Major exhibits are displayed in the Hooker-Garrett, Pannill and Box Mezzanine galleries; three of the museum's six galleries. Work by local and regional artists is displayed in the museum's Lynwood Artists Gallery, which is named in honor of the group of artists that founded Piedmont ArtsAbout Piedmont Arts and that curates the gallery. Piedmont Arts also brings public art to the Martinsville and Henry County through its public art program. The program includes six murals in Uptown Martinsville; 28 mobiles throughout the community; and four sculptures.  R.P. Gravely-A.J. Lester Art Garden  In 2017, Piedmont Arts opened the R.P. Gravely-A.J. Lester Art Garden, an outdoor gallery of installation art, which features three sculptures by Virginia artists Ed Dolinger, Jessie Ward and Mark Wright. The Art Garden is also home to the museum's Historic Little Post Office, which was founded in 1893 by John B. Anglin as a point on the United States postal service star route; and a 100-year-old Remarkable Tree of Virginia.Piedmont Arts Historic Little Post Office  Performing arts  In 1991, Piedmont Arts began a performing arts series. Over 20 years later, the On Stage series features up to five performances per year in a variety of genres. Some artists that have performed as part of the On Stage series include, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Step Afrika!, Sam Bush, Barrage, Cherish the Ladies and Aquila Theatre.  Education  Piedmont Arts brings arts education programs into schools in Martinsville, Henry County and the surrounding areas of Virginia. Elementary through high school students are exposed to plays, musical performances and artist workshops through the museum's outreach programs. The museum also offers guided tours, gallery Treasure Hunts and free on-site crafts and games in the Discovery Room.

A follicular unit (FU) is a naturally occurring bundle of hairs. This bundle contains anywhere from 1 to 4 hairs. A \\"multiple follicular unit\\" is a graft that contains more than one follicular unit. When combined these follicular units can total 5 to 8 hairs creating more significant results. These grafts are not to be mistaken with old style hair plugs harvested with a punch biopsy instrument, but instead are modern day slit grafts harvested from a thin donor strip in the back of the head and separated under magnification.  History  Norman Orentreich, a dermatologist in New York City, is credited for popularizing the modern hair transplant of the 20th century. In 1952, he used a punch biopsy instrument to harvest large round 4 mm grafts from the donor area which were to be transplanted into punch graft sites in the patient's balding area. Although Dr. Orentreich's pioneering research advanced hair transplantation, the results were unnatural, \\"pluggy\\" and extremely sparse. In the 1980s, hair transplantation techniques improved when surgeons began to use much smaller grafts called minigrafts and micrografts which produced better, natural looking results. Today's prevailing technique is a follicular unit transplant (FUT).Bernstein RM, Rassman WR, Seager D, Shapiro R, et al. Standardizing the classification and description of follicular unit transplantation and mini-micrografting techniques. Dermatol Surg 1998; 24: 957-63 Follicular unit transplants require the separation of follicles in their natural groupings. Under a microscope the hair in the donor area can be seen growing in patterns of 1, 2, 3 and 4 hairs. Most common are the 1, 2 and 3 hair groupings. Micrografts or single hair grafts are placed in the frontal hairline while FU Grafts containing 2 to 4 hairs are placed behind the hairline. Results with this technique are generally very natural but can lack density and require more than one surgery for satisfying results. For some doctors, using micrografts and follicular units only is not enough. Instead, they choose to use a mixture of micro grafts, FU grafts and ‚ÄúMultiple Follicular Unit Grafts‚Äù.Elliott VW (2005) Grafts containing multiple follicular units have advantages for surgeon and patient. Hair Transplant Forum Int 15:203  Procedure  Using multiple follicular unit grafts behind the hairline which contain more than one naturally occurring follicular unit bundle, although still controversial,Limmer BL (2005) Transplanted grafts should consist only of naturally occurring follicular unit. Hair Transplant Forum Int 15:203 is becoming more widely accepted because of the proven natural results. Doctors combine micrografts, follicular units, and multi-FU's which results in 2-3 times the hair density of traditional hair transplant procedures. The advantage of this technique is that each graft contains more hair density, the hairs are more likely to be grouped in a natural pattern, the tissue is healthier because it is less likely to be damaged during separation and the actual surgery takes less time. The most impressive advantage is that the hair surgery achieves more satisfying results in just a single procedure.  Risks and Side Effects  Post operative bleeding can occur in the first few days after surgery. There may be moderate swelling anywhere from 1 to 5 days. Temporary numbness can occur and in some rare cases can last for years. There may be temporary tightness in the suture line and/or scalp sensitivity.  Cost  The cost of a hair transplant surgery using multiple follicular unit grafts can be significantly less than surgeries done with micro grafts and follicular units only. When using only FU grafts, there is a hidden cost because it will ultimately require more surgeries to achieve the same density as one surgery using multiple follicular unit grafts.

Produced by Larry Darmour, the series was notable for essentially launching the careers of Mickey Rooney and Billy Barty. The series was based on Fontaine Fox's popular comic strip series, Toonerville Trolley. In 1925 Fox placed a newspaper ad for a dark-haired child to play the role of \\"Mickey McGuire\\" in a series of short films. This ad attracted the attention of Mrs Nell Yule, the recently separated wife of vaudevillian Joseph Yule, who believed her son Joseph \\"Joe\\" Yule, Jr. (later known as Mickey Rooney) was right for the part. Lacking the money to have her son's hair dyed, Mrs. Yule took her son to the audition after applying burnt cork to his scalp.Current Biography 1942. H.W. Wilson Co. (January 1942). pp704-06. . Joe got the role and became \\"Mickey\\" for 78 of the comedies, running from 1927 to 1934, starting with Mickey's Circus, released September 4, 1927, and ending with Mickey's Medicine Man in 1934. These had been adapted from the Toonerville Trolley comic strip, which contained a character named Mickey McGuire. Yule briefly became Mickey McGuire legally in order to trump an attempted copyright lawsuit (if it were his legal name, the film producer Larry Darmour did not owe the comic strip writers royalties). His mother also changed her surname to McGuire in an attempt to bolster the argument, but the film producers lost. The litigation settlement awarded damages to the owners of the cartoon character, as well as compelled the twelve-year-old actor to refrain from calling himself by the name Mickey McGuire on and off screen.Server, Lee, Ava Gardner \\"Love is Nothing\\" (2006), St. Martin's Press Rooney later claimed that, during his Mickey McGuire days, he met cartoonist Walt Disney at the Warner Brothers studio, and that Disney was inspired to name Mickey Mouse after him,Albin, Kira.

GrandTimes.com Senior Magazine. 1995. although Disney always said that he had changed the name from \\"Mortimer Mouse\\" to \\"Mickey Mouse\\" on the suggestion of his wife.Gabler, Neal, Walt Disney, (2006), Alfred A. Knopf The series was very popular in its day, often rivaling Hal Roach's Our Gang series. In fact, it was the only Our Gang series rival to make a successful transition into the talkies. The films were later distributed well into the 1940s, but were rarely shown on television. Therefore, the series is all but forgotten today. Cast and characters The series had a wide variety of interesting characters, many of which were created by Fontaine Fox. The characters lived in a town known as Toonerville. *Mickey McGuire is a tough, street-wise lower class kid of Irish descent. He usually wears a shirt with a tablecloth pattern, a pair of pants rolled up to his knees, a pair of shoes that are two sizes too big, and a derby with a large hole at the top. He has greasy black hair, which according to Mickey Rooney was actually something similar to coal dust, as his mother could not afford to dye his hair properly for the role. He said that \\"it wasn't fun, but I did it anyway\\". He is the leader of the Scorpions club, and often leads the club into mischief. Mickey doesn't take back talk from anybody, no matter how big they may be. Though Mickey is extremely tough in the series' earlier years, he progresses into more of a heartfelt character as time goes on. In the series' later years, Mickey often tries to assist the less fortunate people in town any way he can. In the silent era, Mickey is often stuck babysitting his baby brother (referred to as \\"Mickey's Kid Brudder\\"). During the talkie era, the baby disappeared and was replaced by \\"Billy McGuire\\". Mickey McGuire was played by Mickey Rooney from 1927 until the series' end in 1934. For reasons unknown, Rooney was absent from the series during the 1931-1932 season. Co-star Marvin Stephens took over for the role for that season in Rooney's absence. *Hambone Johnson is Mickey's best friend. Hambone (or \\"Ham\\" for short) is of African descent. He usually wears a short sleeve shirt, shorts, overgrown shoes, and a sack hat with a clothespin pinned to it. Because of the time the series was produced, Hambone was sometimes forced to be depicted as an exaggerated African American stereotype. However, Hambone proved to have more dignity than most characters who were in this sort of a role. Hambone is often taken advantage of by Mickey. However, Hambone has sometimes questioned Mickey's ways, asking him, \\"Why do I always have to do everything?\\". Nonetheless, Hambone clearly has a close friendship with Mickey. Whenever Mickey feels he needs somebody to go with him for one reason or another, he almost always chooses Hambone. Despite the fact that Mickey takes advantage of Hambone, he has also shown worry for Hambone's safety. One example is in Mickey's Ape Man (1933), where Ham is in danger, and calls out for help. Mickey is quick to jump into action and save his pal. Ham also is usually the one who is left in charge of the Scorpions whenever Mickey is not present. Hambone has a younger brother named \\"Lucky\\", who appeared towards the end of the series. Hambone was played by Jimmy Robinson for a majority of the series. However, he has been replaced by another actor in a few of the films due to unknown absences. *Billy McGuire is Mickey's younger brother. A blonde haired boy, he often wears a short sleeve shirt, shorts with suspenders, and small shoes. Billy first appeared early on in the talkie era. During the silent era, Mickey often had to babysit his baby brother (played by a variety of unknown infants). Without any explanation, Billy showed up early in the talkie era, originally being known as \\"Shorty\\". Billy's role in the series grew as time went on. He is essentially the runt of the group, sometimes left out of the fun for being too small. In situations like this, Billy manages to outsmart the older kids, and proves that he can do just as much as they can, if not more. Other times, Billy winds up being the hero, saving the other kids from certain danger. On other occasions, Mickey calls on Billy for special tasks, evidently recognizing the talents his younger brother has to offer. Billy was played by Billy Barty, who played the role of \\"Mickey's Kid Brudder\\" in at least one of the series' silents. *Stinky (or \\"Stinkie\\") Davis is Mickey's arch rival. Stinkie typically wears a Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit. Unlike Mickey and his pals, Stinkie is wealthy, snobbish, and always ready to poke fun at the Scorpions. Stinkie takes after his father, Henry Davis, who later becomes the mayor of Toonerville. Stinkie often tries to make the lives of Mickey and the Scorpions as miserable as possible. However, Mickey and his gang prove to be smarter than Stinkie and his friends, always turning the tables on their rivals (sometimes completely unaware of it). Stinky was played by a wide variety of actors throughout the series run. From 1927 to 1928, the role was played by an unknown actor, believed by some to be Leo Lowenstein, step-son of Monty Banks. Buddy Brown took over the role until the end of the silent era. Series supporting player Kendall McComas briefly played the role in the series' earliest talkies of 1929. Douglas Fox played the role from 1930 until 1933. Douglas Scott played the role for the series' final season, appearing in five of the last six films. *Tomboy Taylor is a member of Mickey's gang, and is the only girl in the gang. Tomboy is a blonde haired girl who wears a hairnet (which causes her hair to stick straight up), a dress, visible bloomers, and knee high socks. Though the only girl in the club, Tomboy is treated like a regular member of the gang. She proves to be just as tough as the boys, always ready to fight Stinkie's gang with the rest of the kids. However, Tomboy has shown femininity, such as in Mickey's Ape Man (1933) where she would rather stay behind and make a dress than go out hunting with the boys. Tomboy was played by Delia Bogard from the beginning to the series until 1933. Shirley Jean Rickert took over the role for the final season. *Katrink is a member of Mickey's gang. He is a normal sized boy, but has large muscles and an incredible amount of strength. Katrink' has blonde hair, and usually wears a sweat shirt, long pants, a hat. Katrink' sometimes shows his incredible amount of strength by easily lifting heavy objects. He was played by Marvin Stephens for most of the series, going as far back as 1928. Prior to that, the role was played by a few unknown actors. Mickey Rooney was absent from the series for the 1931-1932 season, and Stephens was chosen to take over the role of McGuire. Since Stephens was busy playing another character, Katrink' was taken over by Donald Haines.

These reissues were often given new titles (i.e. Mickey's Race became Mickey's Derby Day, Mickey's Merry Men became Mickeys Brigade). In 1945, Darmour and former series director Jesse Duffy edited five of the shorts into a feature film compilation titled Mickey the Great. In this feature, Delia Bogard and two of the series' female supporting players returned to 'host' the complication of shorts. The five films used (Mickey's Big Broadcast, Mickey's Charity, Mickey's Ape Man, Mickey's Disguises, and Mickey's Race) were cut down to about half of their original length, and music was added into the background of each film. Many of the shorts found their way into the home movie market. The edited versions of the films used for Mickey the Great showed up on the market, as did various five-minute clips of the silent shorts for toy reel projectors. The last six shorts in the series were originally distributed by Columbia Pictures. Along with several other Columbia short subjects, these six films were bought up by Screen Gems and shown on television beginning in 1958. The silent films also appeared on various television programs that also featured various Our Gang silent shorts. The Mischief Makers series, created by National Telepix, was a children's program during the early 1960s, and mainly featured various Pathe Our Gang silents cut down to about half of their original length. Sound effects and carnival music were added to the films, as were narration. Some of the McGuire shorts found their way into this package. Shorts from other Our Gang rival series also wound up in the package. Another children's television program Those Lovable Scallawags with their Gangs also featured various Our Gang silents, as well as various rival series shorts (including Mickey McGuire). Sadly, the films were rarely shown on television, as opposed to the Our Gang shorts. Because of this, the series is hardly remembered today. The late 1980s brought the arrival of the Mickey McGuire shorts to home video for the first time. United American Video and Summit Media Co. released three volumes of the Columbia Mickey McGuire shorts. Mickey Rooney introduced each short. In 2001, ten of the sound shorts made their way to home video on five VHS tapes through Virgil Films and Ent. Though the films were mostly unedited, Virgil did add piano music into the background of some scenes that mainly had action in them, rather than dialogue. In 2006, 8thman restored and remastered nineteen of the films, and released them to DVD. Though restored, 8thman did add a musical soundtrack into the background of selected scenes.

By tying storage management to an organization's existing identity infrastructure, it has been pointed out, Novell Storage Manager enables the administration of users across all file servers \\"as a single pool rather than [in] separate independently managed domains.\\" Novell Storage Manager is a component of the Novell File Management Suite. How It Works Novell Storage Manager dynamically manages and provisions storage based on user and group events that occur in the directory, including user creations, group assignments, moves, renames, and deletions. When a change happens in the directory that affects a user‚Äôs file storage needs or user storage policy, Storage Manager applies the appropriate policy and makes the necessary changes at the file system level to address those storage needs. The following key components comprise Novell Storage Manager's identity and policy-driven state machine architecture: Directory services; Storage policies; Novell Storage Manager event monitors; Novell Storage Manager policy engine; Novell Storage Manager agents; and Action objects. This state machine architecture enables the engine to properly deal with transient waits with directory synchronization issues. It also allows recovery from failures involving network communications, a target server or a server running a component of Storage Manager‚Äîincluding the policy engine itself. If a failure or interruption occurs at any point during operation, Storage Manager will be able to successfully continue the operation from where it was when the interruption occurred. Reviews Jon Toigo called Novell Storage Manager \\"a robust and smart approach to corralling user files... into an organized and efficient management scheme\\". He also said it was \\"best in class\\" of the products he'd reviewed.

Blau was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1921. He studied in the Jewish High School of Budapest. As a youngster, he spent his summer months in the town of Bonyh√°d. He survived the horrors committed to the Jews during World War II by a stroke of luck, and after the war, he settled in the town on Bonyhad, where he married a local girl, Sara Kuttner. In 1956, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he and his family fled communist Hungary for a safer haven: USA. He arrived in Boro Park, Brooklyn, New York where he has lived for over fifty years. After five years of extensive investigation and research, Mr. Blau finally published his work, \\"Bonyhad: A Destroyed Community\\" in 1994. . In 2008, a Hungarian translation of the book was published with the amended title, \\"Bonyhad: A Destroyed Jewish Community\\", in Hungarian, \\"Bonyhad: Egy Elpusztitot Zsido Kozosseg\\". The author visited Bonyhad with his wife, daughter and nephew for a presentation of the book at Bonyhad's City Hall, where he was presented a Distinguished Citizen of Bonyhad award by Mayor Potapi Arpad. Just prior to his trip to Hungary he was the subject of a profile, \\"A Brooklyn Gentleman\\", by Reuters correspondent, Mirjam Donath. Mr. Blau's research has been cited by such prestigious scholars as Sir Martin Gilbert (see ).

He attended the Christian Brothers, St Patrick‚Äôs College, Goulburn, NSW, finishing in 1965. After school he won a Commonwealth Scholarship to Sydney University where he finished two years of physics and maths studies for a science degree. That was when he realised that being a priest was his true vocation. He received his training to become a priest from St Columba's College, Springwood, NSW and St Patrick's College, Manly. He finished a degree in theology, graduating with honours. He then returned to the University of Sydney and finished his science degree.Catholic Weekly 25 May, 2008 He was ordained in 1974 by Archbishop Thomas Vincent Cahill and for the next two years was assistant parish priest in Cootamundra, NSW. In 1976 he was sent to the US to study at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. where he obtained a Ph.D. in religious education. He travelled to various communities in the US and experienced the charismatic renewal of Catholic life. He realised then that this was the way he wanted to be involved with the Church and with God. Back in Australia in 1980, the charismatic renewal movement was also emerging. Appointed assistant priest to the Cathedral in Canberra and Diocesan Youth Minister, Fr Ken also became a member of the Disciples of Jesus Covenant Community. In 1985 three young men from the Disciples of Jesus Community approached him independently and said they wanted to become priests. Fr Ken, along with the three young men, prayed on this matter for more than a year and it gradually became clear the Lord wanted him to form a Brotherhood to evangelise young people and live a life of poverty as Jesus had, and help the poor. The Brotherhood would have a special love for the Virgin Mary and be dedicated to the heart of Christ. Discussing this with Archbishop Francis Carroll of Canberra and Goulburn, it was eventually decided Fr Ken would leave his position as assistant priest at the Cathedral and form what was seen as a modified youth ministry and form of diocese priesthood which would be the equivalent of a congregation. The Missionaries of God's Love (MGL) came into being in 1986 with a base in a suburban house in Canberra. 20 years later, the MGL has more than 40 members, 13 ordained priests, two deacons, 16 at its seminary in Melbourne which is overseen by Fr Chris Ryan.AD2000 November 2007 He is the author of 5 books His Name is Mercy, Becoming Fire, Radical Way of Love, Amazing Love, and the best-selling Young Men Rise Up.Connor Court Publishing References Category:Australian Roman Catholic priests Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Australia Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Living people Category:Catholic University of America alumni Category:Australian Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Australian Roman Catholics ","title":"Ken Barker"},{"id":"28205746","text":"Rose Hill is a small hamlet in a rural area of the town of Marcellus, New York along Rose Hill Road.

His small ship Flecha was not a business success, however. In 1849 he joined the California Gold Rush. By 1850 he had lost his fortune, and hired as a common sailor bound for China. He got as far as Honolulu in the Hawaiian Islands where Robert Cheshire Janion hired him into the firm of Starkey, Janion & Company. Green became a partner and the company was known as Janion, Green & Company. By 1851 he founded and became first president of a social club for British residents he called \\"The Mess\\". It was later renamed The Pacific Club. After David M. Weston's Honolulu Iron Works building burned down, he took over the business in 1860 with Thomas Hughes. His company imported machinery from American factories for use in sugar plantations in Hawaii. In Honolulu in January 1862 Green married Anna McKibben, daughter of Robert McKibben, a physician. They had a daughter, Mary E. Green, who married J. N. A. Williams, and a son who died young. Prior to this marriage, Green had two children, a daughter, Elizabeth K. Green, who married George Douglas Freeth, Sr., and a son, William Green, with a Hawaiian woman, Lapeka. Green left Janion around 1867, and the English investor Theophilus Harris Davies then had to travel from London to bail out the company. The company was renamed Theo H. Davies & Co., and Green went into business by himself. Green served as acting British consul in 1859 after the health failed of both William Miller and his replacement Busvargus Toup Nicolas (1819‚Äì1859), and again between William W. F. Synge (1826‚Äì1891) and James H. Wodehouse. =Politics= On 17 February 1874, he was appointed minister of foreign affairs, replacing Charles Reed Bishop. A major milestone of his administration was ratifying the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 with the United States on 17 June 1876, which was also signed by Ulysses S. Grant. It had been negotiated for a long time by Elisha Hunt Allen and Henry A. P. Carter. He served until 5 December 1876, when Carter replaced him. He was appointed again as minister of foreign affairs on 22 September 1880, and served until 20 May 1882. He filled in as acting minister of the interior from 28 May to 31 October 1874. At that time he was replaced by Walter M. Gibson. After Gibson fell from power the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii was imposed by force. This gave it the name \\"Bayonet Constitution\\". Green was told to form a new cabinet; he included Lorrin A. Thurston, a leader of the bloodless coup, as minister of interior. Green became minister of finance on 1 July 1887, and served until 22 July 1889 when his health started to fail. =Geology= Illustration of the tetrahedral hypothesis from his 1875 book Green was fascinated by the volcanoes in the Hawaiian islands. By 1855 he wrote a series of articles on local geology in the Sandwich Islands Monthly newspaper of Abraham Fornander. His ideas on the formation of the earth, based on the nebular hypothesis of Pierre-Simon Laplace, shocked the local conservatives who literally believed in creation according to Genesis. In 1857 he published an article in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal based on the theory of Jean-Baptiste √âlie de Beaumont. In 1859 he went on expeditions to view the erupting Mauna Loa and nearby Kƒ´lauea and HualƒÅlai on Hawaii island. He hosted the adventurer Isabella Bird when she came to visit, and gave her a tour of the volcanoes. His first book on his tetrahedral hypothesis was published in 1875. It was \\"...a work which was neglected or ridiculed at the time of its appearance.\\" The journal Nature published only a one-line notice for the book. He published a second volume in 1887 concentrating on volcanic phenomena. This time the Nature journal published three sentences. As his health failed he dictated a criticism of the work of James Dwight Dana. Green died at his home in Honolulu on 7 December 1890. His theory became more widely discussed into the first decades of the 20th century. For example, the French geologist Albert Auguste Cochon de Lapparent mentioned Green's work in his textbook. The American geologist Charles Henry Hitchcock, in his own 1911 book on the Hawaiian volcanoes, said: > The memory of William Lowthian Green will be honored henceforth because of > his success in showing why the Earth has assumed its present relief. Th√©ophile Moreux said observations \\"...point more and more to the truth of an old theory which was long ignored.\\" In their textbooks, Archibald Geikie and Arthur Holmes called the theory '\\"ingenious\\". But by the late 1920s Holmes was promoting theories of continental drift as proposed by Alfred Wegener, which evolved into concepts of plate tectonics. Modern theories view the current continental configurations as only transitory, so give no special role to the tetrahedral shape. However, they do attribute a large influence to volcanic activity as he suggested. Works  * Letter to William T.

Built in 1882, it is the second-oldest theatre in Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Building the theatre Tibbits Opera House as it looked in 1882 with its original Second Empire architectural facade Because Coldwater was on the main railway between Detroit and Chicago, news traveled from cities where entertainment and cultural activities were already well established. As an area with plenty of lakes and forested parks, Coldwater also attracted city folk as a resort destination.Gillespie, Carolyn L. \\"A History of the Tibbits Opera House, 1882‚Äì1904\\", June 1975, pg. 12. In 1882, when the theatre was built, Coldwater was a day's trip from either Detroit or Chicago, which resulted in Coldwater's becoming a natural stopping point for visitors and theatre performers traveling the byway. Accordingly, Coldwater residents developed a strong interest in art, culture and literature. Barton S. Tibbits, the mayor of Coldwater at the time, accepted a challenge to build an opera house in Coldwater. Art Gallery owner H.C. Lewis first proposed that he and Tibbits fund and build an opera house in response to pressure from local newspapers with each man raising $8,000 for the venture, but Lewis soon backed down.Gillespie, pg. 15. Tibbits forged ahead alone, declaring he would \\"build an opera house if it 'bust' my factory\\", referring to his cigar business in town.Coldwater Republican, November 8, 1881. At the dedication of the theatre, Tibbits offered two reasons for building the theatre. To a gathered audience, he said, > \\"Through two motives I was stimulated to make this investment. The first was > to erect a monument to my memory that every man, woman and child in > Coldwater would appreciate. Second, I would show the unhappy dissatisfied > portion of our community that I was not selfish, but ready and willing to do > anything in my power to beautify and ornament our city. The old time worn > saying that Coldwater is behind the times, and has no respectable place of > amusement, tonight passes into oblivion, and with more pleasure than I am > able to express I present for your inspection this evening a theatre > unequaled in any city the size of Coldwater.\\"Coldwater Republican, \\"Theatre > Dedication\\", 22 September 1882. The Coldwater Republican had this to say about Tibbits' efforts: > \\"For a long time a serious need has been felt in our city for a first-class > place of amusement. Although Coldwater is the home of so many wealthy > citizens, no one has seemed to possess sufficient courage to embark in so > hazardous an undertaking until Mr. B. S. Tibbits, with his accustomed energy > and \\"push\\" which has accomplished so much in other directions, took the > matter in hand and put into execution the hopes and wishes of those who, > although acknowledging the need, dared not venture to undertake so great a > responsibility, and the result is a beautiful building, an ornament to our > city of which we may justly be proud, and an honor to Mr. Tibbits that will > endure after the curtain has fallen on the last act in the drama of his > life.\\"Coldwater Republican, 19 September 1882. Although later in life he considered the marvelous opera house his financial downfall, his prophetic words that his gift to the community would make his name well known far beyond his time as one of Coldwater's generous patriarchs has surely come to pass. Tibbits himself was described by one later owner of Tibbits, Dennis Vanes, as \\"the greatest 'pusher' in Michigan.\\" He added, \\"Mr. Tibbits was a hustler by nature, broad minded and liberal and always ready to help the needy and suffering. He was outspoken in his sentiments and sometimes gave offense where none was intended.\\"Coldwater Daily Reporter, 1920. Barton was the son of Allen Tibbits, one of Coldwater's founders. After returning to Coldwater after the Civil War to start his tobacco and cigar business, Tibbits found himself involved in a variety of local projects and buildings \\"including the skating rink, cart factory, and oil stove industry. He even purchased a number of steamboats to navigate the local lakes.\\"Gillespie, pg. 16‚Äì17. According to Tibbits himself, the opera house was one of the costliest projects of his career. He stated, \\"I attribute to this enterprise the Opera House my downfall, and the sacrifice of a business, which had I been selfish, would today have made me a millionaire.\\" Indeed, the venture broke Tibbits financially by the end of his life. Tibbits hired Mortimer Smith, designer of the Detroit Grand Opera House to manifest his vision. The Coldwater Republican, the newspaper of the time, declared \\"the beautiful theatre will be second to none in the state except in size.\\" The site chosen for the theatre was a plot of land on S. Hanchett street, just off the city's busiest street, Chicago Street, and nearby one of Tibbit's own cigar factories. Coldwater itself was known for its manufacture of cigars and horse breeding.Gillespie, pg. 12. Excavation began Wednesday, November 23, 1881, and the theatre opened almost a year later, September 21, 1882. In the opinion of the Coldwater Republican, Tibbits Opera House was \\"one of the safest and most stable structures in Southern Michigan.\\" Tibbits Opera House greeted its first opening night audience on September 21, 1882. After parking their horses and buggies at the Livery Stable, theatre patrons, dressed in their finest, entered the town's new treasure under the gaze of a gathered crowd. They were welcomed by Barton S. Tibbits, and then ushered into the seating area. Behind the closed curtain, actors and crew waited to present Maid of Arran. After remarks by local dignitaries, Tibbits was summoned onstage with \\"tumultuous applause.\\" According to the Coldwater Republican, the performance wasn't as impressive as the opera house. \\"The song and dance might have been omitted with advantage\\" sums up the newspaper's account. Eras of management =The Tibbits era= The opera houses of the 1800s were the community gathering places for town meetings, local performers, and whatever touring performers passed through. Many opera houses of the era occupied second or third stories of retail buildings. The names of these buildings, \\"opera houses\\", though suggestive of a high form of art were named to associate the buildings with the grand style of theatres in Europe. They were not about opera however. Performing acts and theatre companies toured, often with a repertoire of several plays, musicians, and novelty acts. As the touring became more organized theatre circuits developed with performers moving from city to city. Shows warmed up on their way to New York City and Broadway or followed a certain pattern across the nation. By the early 20th century, vaudeville theatres were being built across the United States to host these shows. After a magnificent opening costing $25 a seat (when eggs sold for a dime a dozen!) Tibbits enjoyed some grand years, hosting a variety of these kinds of diverse productions. All in all, the opera house hosted 111 plays during Tibbits' management, the majority of which was comedy.Gillespie, pg. 40 Dramas also hit the stage such as the Shakespeare favorites Richard III, Romeo and Juliet, and Macbeth.Gillespie, Apendix I, pg. 153, 159 Also popular was the oft performed Uncle Tom's Cabin, which nonetheless drew heavy criticism from local reviewers. The Courier lamented \\"We knew it would come sooner or later, but have prayed that the calamity might be averted. Our prayers have been in vain and we will have to submit to the inevitable.\\"The Courier, December 2, 1882 Yet theatre was only one of a large variety of events performed in Tibbits. The stage was the perfect forum for public speeches and lectures. Such lectures covered topics as Edwin Lee Brown's \\"cruelty to animals\\", Ida Hulten's \\"What Shall We Do To Be Saved?\\" lectures on reformed outlaws, the arctic, and spiritualism. Allen Tibbits, Barton's father, even offered a lecture called \\"The Origin of the Aborigines of North America.\\" The opera house was a convenient place for various political speeches as well.Gillespie, Apendix I, pg. 149, 152, 154, 158, 159 The opera house hosted a litany of other events, each in a category of its own. Audiences enjoyed trained dog shows, wrestling matches, Humpty Dumpty Vaudeville and Variety shows consisting of acrobatics, juggling, and farce, the Boston Operatic Minstrels and stereopticon shows.Gillespie, pg. 48, Apendix I, pg. 149, 151, 159 Locals shared their abilities through talent shows and poetry readings.Gillespie, Apendix I, pg. 154, 159 The site was used for community events other than performances such as high school commencements, dancing parties, and masquerade parties.Gillespie, Apendix I, pg. 151, 159 As one of the more seemingly random public events, Tibbits Opera House hosted a reception for a man found not-guilty of arson charges.Gillespie, pg. 51 Despite such a variety of events hosted in the opera house and the diverse constituency that utilized Tibbits on a regular basis, from the outset Coldwater's gem may have been too big to truly thrive financially in such a small community. In 1885 due to declining attendance and Barton S. Tibbits' own financial difficulties, the opera house faced the very real possibility of being turned into a roller mill.The Courier, 1884 The local community however had become too invested in the theatre to let it go. Carolyn Gillespie has noted that \\"although a privately owned theatre, the Tibbits functioned more like a public institution.\\"Gillespie, pg. 54 Thus the community, with the help of the local press, launched the first of what would be a long string of unrelenting attempts to save the theatre. =The Henning era= In 1885 Joseph Henning, a German saloon-keeper, answered the community's call to action and purchased the opera house for $13,000, just over half the original cost of $25,000.Gillespie, pg. 55 While several individuals assumed management duties throughout Henning's tenure, one of the biggest surprises was his teenage daughter Huldah Henning who by 1891 was managing the theatre on her own, signing her father's name since many performers would not accept a female manager. Not only was a female opera house manager unusual, but the Courier claimed that Huldah was \\"probably the youngest Opera House manager in the country and the only successful female one.\\"The Courier, August 1, 1891, p. 1 Henning was willing to try some new things to spur business for the opera house. He transformed the front part of the basement into a restaurant and saloon and even built an -long bowling alley. In 1891 the saloon was turned into a tea room offering ice cream, cold lunches, and lemonade, which Henning's wife and daughters staffed.Gillespie, pg. 58 Henning also tried to improve the quality of theatrical circuits that came to perform at the opera house, but frequent cancelations and financial difficulties once again threatened to close Tibbits. A number of solutions were proposed for the theatre. Some suggested that the building be used as a Town Hall and council room. Others proposed a beer garden with variety shows. Thespians who wanted the original purpose of the building to be preserved favored the establishment of a stock company to manage the finances. None of these ideas came to fruition however, and Henning sputtered from one year to the next barely making ends meet.Gillespie, pg. 62 If the diversity of productions during the Tibbits Era was broad, it was even more so during the Henning years. Theatrical productions included such genres as Irish comedy, combination plays, repertory companies, drama, opera, and operetta. Comedies began to shift toward vaudeville-type performances in which \\"the performers became more important than the play\\", with play reviews focusing more on \\"the actors' songs, dances and acrobatic skills rather than on the play itself\\"Gillespie, pg. 74 Uncle Tom's Cabin companies continued to tour, trying to outdo each other with the most sensational stage elements.Gillespie, pg. 77 Set designers pushed the limits with special effects creating a rainstorm on stage with actual water and even pushing the safety limit by lighting part of the stage set in \\"The Streets of New York\\" on fire.Gillespie, pg. 66‚Äì67 Such efforts were part of a theatrical movement toward \\"naturalness\\" and \\"realism\\" on stage. In \\"The Police Patrol\\", a scene depicted the interior of a police patrol barn with horses in stalls. Once the police alarm sounded, the horses were harnessed and dashed off stage in a matter of seconds.Gillespie, pg. 73 Such was the extent to which performers pushed the element of Realism. The number of lectures hosted at Tibbits picked up during the Henning years in part because for a time, the YMCA sponsored various lecture series. Topics ranged from the problems of the working man hosted by National Assembly of Knights of Labor representative R. F. Trevellick, C. E. Bolton's \\"Russia and the Romanoffs\\", a lecture by Robert McIntyre on military life in the Post Civil War South, George Kennan's \\"Camp Life in Eastern Siberia\\", topics ranging from love and marriage to prison life, Paul B. DuChailler's prohibitionist lecture, George R. Wendling's discussion of \\"Saul of Tarsus\\", lectures on various world geographies, and even one called \\"Old Ocean, Our Slave and Master\\", by Prof. Juno B. Demotte.Gillespie, pg. 84‚Äì87 Perhaps the biggest draw came from Robert G. Ingersoll who presented a lecture on Abraham Lincoln, attracting audiences from neighboring counties who flocked to listen to his \\"matchless oratory and brilliant word-painting\\"The Courier, February 27, 1892, pg. 8 Such events not only made Tibbits a place of entertainment, but one of education as well. Speaking events were not only meant to inform, but also to persuade. Such was assuredly the purpose of a large number of political speeches and rallies during the Henning years. These events, generally always for Republican causes and candidates, sported rallies with bands, fireworks, and speeches. Two governors even spoke at Tibbits: Gov. Alger in 1885 and Gov. Luce in 1890.Gillespie, pg. 91 Yet Tibbits was an entertainment center first and foremost, and the Henning years made a bid to outdo the Tibbits Era in wild, extravagant shows. The opera house hosted everything from boxing matches featuring the likes of John L. Sullivan, to trained horses and mules, a presentation by women who claimed to read minds, and even camel rides.Gillespie, Apendix I, pg. 164, 184, 195 A group called the \\"Fat Men's Club\\" entertained the crowd with \\"singing, dancing and acrobatic performance.\\" The opera house even hosted a company called \\"The County Fair\\" which \\"featured a horse race with three Kentucky thoroughbred horses ridden by professional jockeys over a three-quarter-mile course in full view of the audience.\\"Gillespie, pg. 72 It is safe to assume that such an even was not hosted in the theatre itself. One comedy company went so far as to award a winning raffle ticket holder with a Jersey cow.Gillespie, pg. 76 Such a prize was of a very different nature than the winnings would be for modern Tibbits raffle winners. Tibbits hosted a number of musical performances during the Henning Era as well. Such shows included \\"The Royal Spanish Troubadors\\", the \\"Boston Symphony Orchestral Club\\", the \\"Michigan University Glee and Banjo Club\\", the \\"Swedish National Octet\\" which made two appearances, and the \\"Harvard Quartette.\\"Gillespie, pg. 81‚Äì82 Minstrel groups also took to the stage, although these groups had more of a circus feel to them rather than being strictly musical performances. Such shows included bike acts, juggling, club-swinging, and cornet playing.Gillespie, pg. 88 One show in particular, \\"Duncan Clark's Lady Minstrels and New Arabian Nights\\" reportedly pushed the limits of Coldwater's conservative social mores with one reviewer commenting, \\"‚Ä¶Seated upon the stage were eight females, scantily dressed.‚Ä¶There was nothing, save perhaps a highland fling, that merited any commendation. The singing was insipid, the marching by the amazons horribly executed, a little better than a flock of sheep‚Ä¶It is hoped this city will be spared the infliction of another like exhibition.\\"The Republican, November 15, 1889 Another reviewer called it \\"the vilest show that ever appeared in Coldwater\\", labeling the women as \\"coarse brazen things.\\"The Courier, November 16, 1889, pg. 1 Additional events included art exhibits, high school commencement exercises and reunions, a marionette show, and even a Sanitary Convention.Gillespie, pg. 92‚Äì93 =The Jackson era= Eventually, Joseph Henning's financial struggles caught up to him, and he handed over the management of the theatre to John T. Jackson in 1894, who married Joseph's daughter, Huldah Henning. Together they managed the theatre with Henning ultimately handing over ownership of the theatre to John and Huldah in 1904. They owned and operated the theatre until its sale to Dennis Vanes in 1920.Gillespie, pg. 99 In later years Huldah's younger sister Josephine Henning Beyer had this to say about the Jackson management: \\"Under the superb management of John T. Jackson, Coldwater received the joy of witnessing the very best of dramas, operas, bands and orchestras, and various other amusements in a then modern theatre.\\"Josephine Henning Beyer, \\"Former Owner Recalls some Fond Memories‚Ä¶Never Missed a Play When Business in Its Prime.\\" Coldwater Daily Reporter, November 14, 1959, p. 1 With knowledge and experience that previous managers lacked, Jackson, the \\"first 'theatrical man' to manage the Tibbits\\", was able to make the opera house financially successful for the first time and at a time when other opera houses were on the wane.Gillespie, pg. 100 Not only was he more successful at booking groups for performance, but in the 1890s, he also made improvements to the theatre to give it every modern advantage. Jackson redesigned scenery mechanisms, moved girders to add wing space, made ticket sales more efficient, installed electric fans for the comfort of the audience, added a sprinkler system and steel fire curtain, and updated the available electric current. He may be responsible for the theatre's longevity, since many other theatres were destroyed by fire.Gillespie, pg. 101‚Äì103 Based on the demands of performance companies who insisted on higher ticket prices to justify a trip to Coldwater, Jackson found it necessary to raise ticket prices for the first time. This was met with stiff opposition and criticism by reviewers from the two major local newspapers, The Courier and The Republican. Although these newspapers were unable to deny Jackson's successful management of the theatre, the rift between the press and Tibbits increasingly began to widen. It was a third upstart newspaper, The Daily Reporter, which defended Jackson's management. The only paper that survived was the one that tied its loyalty to the historic opera house.Gillespie, pg. 103‚Äì106 Tibbits Opera House continued to host many of the same types of programming as under previous eras of management, while also bringing new variety to the stage as well. Theatre genres included melodramas, pastoral plays, Irish dramas, combination plays, farce and scenic attractions with Charles Hoyt and Clyde Fitch being the most popular playwrights.Gillespie, pg. 106‚Äì109 The farces tended to focus more on comic specialties rather than a developed plot. Regarding one such farce, At the French Ball, a reviewer quipped, \\"‚Ä¶The play is one of those kind of creations that one enjoys when he has had a good dinner and has nothing else to do but to gaze and laugh, and feel as Frenchy as possible.\\"The Courier and Republican, January 7, 1898, p. 8 Another feature of comedy in this era is that it increasingly included elements of vaudeville with it becoming increasingly \\"difficult to distinguish between pure comedy and variety entertainments.\\"Gillespie, pg. 113 Famous melodramas during the period included The Convict's Daughter and Was She to Blame.Gillespie, pg. 114 The number of Uncle Tom's Cabin companies, whose shows had apparently evolved into farce and comedy from the original serious tenor of the story, declined during this period. But taking the place of Uncle Tom's Cabin was the oft repeated Faust, an opera which stressed scenery and electrical effects.Gillespie, pg. 116 The comic opera Wang featured one of the more absurd stunts performed on the Tibbits stage with a beer-drinking elephant that downed a four-gallon glass of brew.Gillespie, pg. 118 All in all, 376 plays were performed on the Tibbits stage in the decade from 1894 to 1904 alone, a large increase from the Barton S. Tibbits era. Musical performances continued to be popular as well with such groups as the \\"Chicago Marine Band\\", \\"the Mexican Troubadours\\", the \\"Boston Ladies Symphony Orchestra\\", and the very famous \\"Sousa Band\\" featuring John Philip Sousa, which performed twice in 1897 and in 1900.Gillespie, Apendix I, pg. 202, 204, 206, 216 One musician, whose performance was inconvenienced by the failed shipment of his luggage and noisy child in the audience stormed off the stage. The Weekly Courier noted, \\"He deliberately put his fiddle under his arm and left the stage like a crusty old curmudgeon.\\"Weekly Courier, January 25, 1896, p. 1 1898 even featured an open- air concert from the Tibbits balcony, which was part of the original Tibbits fa√ßade.Gillespie, pg. 115 Speeches and lectures continued to be a regular offering on the Tibbits stage. These included such lectures as Wallace Bruce's \\"Philosophy of Wit and Humor\\", Charles Hampton's \\"Hard Times, Their Cause and Cure\\", and Robert G. Ingersoll's \\"Liberty of Man, Woman and Child.\\"Gillespie, Apendix I, pg. 199, 204, 206 Capturing the rhetorical might of such lectures, the Weekly Courier described Judge Yaple's lecture \\"Personality\\", with the following words: \\"A flowing crystal of words, here and there sharply broken into prisms of color, through which one caught a glimpse of crimson sunsets, the majesty of the mountains, the waving flowers of the meadow, the sweetness of the lilies of the valley, the stillness and solemnity of the leafy woods, the songs of birds, the celestial harmony of the starry heavens and the roar and thunder of a thousand Niagaras.\\"Weekly Courier, September 14, 1895, p. 10 A number of political speeches were offered as well by the likes of Gov. Rich, Senator J. C. Burrows, Gov. Shaw of Iowa, and Adeli Stevenson, a Vice Presidential nominee.Gillespie, pg. 128‚Äì129 Variety and Vaudeville continued to increase in popularity during the Jackson years with repeat performances by Humpty Dumpty companies, pantomime, and even magic shows.Gillespie, pg. 127‚Äì128 Shows also took an eerie turn with Anna Eva Fay's spiritualism performance, Mysterious Oneida's s√©ance, and Hermann the Great's show on occult phenomena.Gillespie, Apendix I, 198, 202, 229 As technology improved, so also did the kinds of innovative performances Tibbits was able to put on stage. Such obscure technologies as cinematoscopes and luminere cinematographs offered the promise of displaying moving pictures. Kleine's Lumiere Cinematograph promised families the chance to see their sons in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War march toward the camera.Gillespie, pg. 129 Thomas Edison's Magniscope never reached Coldwater because it exploded en route, but his Animotoscope did. Eventually the Lyman H. Howe Company offered genuine moving pictures with its Vivograph Graphophone, which depicted a train ride through the Rocy Mountain's Frazer River Canyon.Gillespie, pg. 129‚Äì130 While such technologies had much to be desired in terms of quality, they were nonetheless important steps in the march toward the modern cinema. Although he had fallen on financial hard times, Barton S. Tibbits lived long enough to see his dream survive and prosper. It is only fitting that upon his death, his memorial service would be held on the very stage that he erected at his own sacrifice for the benefit of Coldwater and the wider community's citizens. His funeral was held August 27, 1889. The opera house also offered memorial services for President McKinley.Gillespie, pg. 214, 222 =The Cinema era= Tibbits Opera House during the cinema era. The original facade was bricked over to give the theatre a contemporary feel. In 1919 Dennis and Estella Vanes purchased Tibbits and brought in movies. William J. Schulte bought the opera house in 1934 and physically \\"modernized\\" it into a movie theater. =The Modern Era= The 1960s facade before any restoration efforts began Today, Tibbits' youth and educational programming provides diverse opportunities for children and teens to participate in the arts. The programming includes productions in which the cast is made up of area children, touring arts presentations and Popcorn Theatre, and shows presented for children featuring members of Tibbits Summer Theatre's professional summer stock company. Additionally, concerts offer a variety of touring performers. The Tibbits Art Gallery on the lower level, exhibits the work of many fine professional artists, local art groups and children as well as provides a yearly juried show for high school students. The Tibbits also holds an annual benefit auction that is as much a social event for the area as it is a fund-raiser. In addition to the programs sponsored by the Tibbits Opera Foundation, the theatre is used extensively by community groups presenting plays, musicals, concerts, dance programs, travelogues, pageants, and variety shows. During the rest of the year Tibbits presents an entertainment series featuring a variety of artists and styles. Recent performers have included Jeff Daniels, Melissa Manchester, and John Corbett. The effort is to bring quality arts performances and \\"name\\" entertainment to Branch County's rural community. Funding for the Tibbits Opera House comes primarily from memberships in the Tibbits Opera Foundation which are open to individual and corporate supporters. Tibbits Summer Theatre The cast on stage during On Broadway: A Modern Songbook in June 2010. Tibbits has long sought to present the best possible theatre for Branch County and the surrounding area. For 45 years since 1966, Tibbits Summer Theatre (TST) has brought professional theatre by stock company to Southwest Michigan and the tri-state area. USA Today has even named Tibbits one of \\"10 great places to see the lights way off Broadway.\\"USAToday.com Yet the first two years of summer stock at the newly restored Tibbits, beginning in 1964, were produced by the American Theatre Festival. Mostly made up of theatre professionals from Indiana, the group presented a large season, with a new show opening every week. The comedy \\"The Solid Gold Cadillac\\" was the opening production, followed by nine other plays and one musical. By 1966, Tibbits executive director Larry Carrico decided that Tibbits itself would produce the season. Musicals became the stock-in-trade and are still the staple of the Tibbits season. While Tibbits has produced the biggest names such as \\"Show Boat\\", \\"South Pacific\\", and \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\", it has also been instrumental in introducing audiences to lesser known gems such as \\"Lucky Stiff\\", \\"Hi-Hat Hattie\\", \\"Baby\\" and \\"I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change.\\" Architecture =Original construction= Preserved in the edition of September 19, 1882 of the Coldwater Republican newspaper is a richly detailed account of the building's physical description. From surviving photos and valuable accounts like these, we can re-imagine the experience of the original theatre patron. When Tibbits Opera House first opened, such a patron would have found the theatre to be nothing less than an architectural masterpiece. A modern-day view of the inside of the theatre house A patron's first experience of the theatre would have been a view of the building's fa√ßade. With its French \\"Second Empire\\" architectural design, the building was adorned with a -tall, slate-covered cupola with a flag staff mounted with a golden eagle statue. The tip of the dome itself towered above the pavement below. At the base of the cupola, one could behold an elegant bronze bust of Shakespeare, and below this still, inscribed in an arch above the front window was \\"Tibbits Opera-House, 1882\\", in gold leaf. The face itself consisted of iron work, red and black brick, and cut stone \\"united in excellent taste.\\" Three large windows allowed the glow of the sun to fill the theatre lobby, and below the middle window was an iron balcony furnished with glass globe lanterns. As a patron entered the front doors, he would have found himself in a lobby with two stairwells leading up to the balcony, a manager's office, and a smoking room. Upon stepping through the terracotta leather covered and gold trimmed wooden doors into the auditorium, a patron would have been softly bathed in the shimmering glow of 94 gas lights. These lights, were crafted of polished brass and fitted with etched glass globes. The stage itself was equipped with 174 gas lights. All the lights in the entire theatre were controlled from the stage by means of a pipe system, allowing the stage manager to ignite or extinguish any or all of these brilliant lights in an instant. Beneath a dome resplendent with painted cherubs, a large chandelier, known as an \\"Opal glass reflector\\", scattered sparkles of reflected light over all. Elegant red Brussels' carpet softened patrons' steps, and grand opera chairs, upholstered in dark Cardinal plush awaited to seat them. These chairs were engraved with the monogram, B.S.T., Barton Tibbits' initials, and many of these chairs offered foot rests and hat and umbrella racks. Amazingly the auditorium originally held 1,000 seats for patrons. The seating area was divided into the parquet and the parquet circle ‚Äì two separate areas on the floor in front of the orchestra pit. The walls of the auditorium, colored in cameo tints and dashes of cardinal, green, and gold color in \\"conventional figures\\" produced \\"a warm, sunny effect and [gave] the auditorium a bright and airy appearance which is very pleasing.\\" Dominating the scene was a grandly ornate -wide by -long proscenium stage with elegant opera boxes situated within the massive tin and plaster arch. A modern-day view of the Tibbits stage and proscenium arch The stage itself had all the latest technological features. Scenery and curtains were shifted and moved via the rigging loft, and the stage itself included a \\"paint-bridge and movable frame, five sets of grooves, trapdoors, and every modern convenience for producing all kinds of scenic effects.\\" Additionally, speaking tubes and bell signals connected the stage manager with the box office, orchestra, and scene and trap shifters. The stage's collection of scenic backdrops was exhaustive and of the highest quality, and was a third larger than the Kalamazoo Opera House.Gillespie, pg. 22. The boxes were draped with cardinal silk plush curtains, lined with gold, and trimmed with lace. In the center of the proscenium arch one beheld a portrait of William Shakespeare and above this portrait against a light-blue background was \\"a group of cherubs, gracefully posed, representing music and the drama.\\" Surrounding the main chandelier in the auditorium were more \\"cunning little cherubs\\" trailing garlands of flowers. In the words of the Coldwater Republican, \\"The delicate coloring of the background brings out the figures in strong relief so one may almost imagine them floating in space and inhale the odor of their fragrant burden.\\" The cove around the auditorium also was decorated with \\"vases of flowers, bouquets and conventional vines and figures.\\" L. B. Chevelier, who painted many of the stage's backdrops, was the artistic genius behind such creations.Gillespie, pg. 20. Regarding the workmanship of the theatre, Carolyn Gillespie has observed that \\"Tibbits was easily as elegant as the Second Olympic Theatre which was completed in St. Louis that same year.\\"Gillespie, pg. 25. Elegance was paired with superb acoustics in the rendering of the stage and auditorium, and all in all, ironically the best visual description is perhaps given by the Republican: \\"It is impossible to give a description of the decorations which will convey an adequate idea of their beauty. They must be seen in order to be appreciated.\\" Unfortunately for the modern patron, such an opportunity has long since died. =The campaign for restoration= A key phase of restoration is completed with the hoisting of the new cupola on top of the theatre. After years of serving Branch County, toward the end of the Cinema Era the hall was slated for destruction. Tibbits was boarded up and scheduled to be razed by the end of the 1950s. Local supporters rallied support and raised funds to save the theatre. Many theatres were not as fortunate and were torn down in the name of urban renewal, but Tibbits Opera House was saved, thanks to concerned citizens who restored the interior to Victorian style. The Tibbits Opera Foundation and Arts Council was founded in 1963 and now operates the facility year-round as a community center for the arts. With the turn of the century, the Tibbits Opera Foundation mobilized to mount yet another restoration campaign with fundraising and design development beginning in 2002. While the 1960s renovation was intended to save the theatre, the latest renovation effort is intended to return Tibbits to its original grandeur. In the spring of 2006, the addition of a handicap accessible entrance and elevator onto the side of the theatre to make the theatre more accessible to all customers and patrons was completed. In February 2009, another phase of the restoration project was completed with the hoisting of the newly constructed cupola onto the theatre. With the raising of sufficient funds, Phase III, which is the restoration of the 1960s facade to the original French \\"Second Empire\\" architectural design, began in 2011 and was completed in 2013.

Prizes were awarded in four competitions in the course of the festival, at which 191 films were shown at 12 venues across the city with the theme Cinema and Social Interaction and Italian actress Claudia Cardinale was the guest of honor. This edition of the International Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival was the second to be organised solely by the Antalya Foundation for Culture and Arts (AKSAV), a cultural body affiliated with the Antalya Greater Municipality. It opened with at the Glass Pyramid Exhibition Center in Antalya with an awards ceremony and performances from Melike Demiraƒü and controversial director Emir Kusturica with The No Smoking Orchestra. Kustrica, who was to have headed the International Feature Film Competition Jury, withdrew from the festival following claims that he had supported the Serbian genocide of Muslims in Bosnia from protestors, including Turkish Minister of Culture and Tourism Ertuƒürul G√ºnay, who boycotted the opening gala, and director Semih Kaplanoƒülu, who cancelled an out-of-competition screening of his film Honey (). Other events included the four kilometer annual Parade of Stars led by Antalya Mayor Mustafa Akaydƒ±n, who heads AKSAV, which featured E≈üref Kol√ßak, Mujdat Gezen, Erkan Can, Ilker Inanoglu and Sumer Tilmac in cars decorated with carnations, and a gala diner at which honorary awards were presented to Megan Mylan, Fyodor Bondarchuk and Serge Avedikian, and fashion designer Erol Albayrak presented his Cinema collection choreographed by Uƒüurkan Erez. Akaydƒ±n announced that this year the festival has been freed from the clutches of a certain group of people and has taken important steps to become a festival of the people. Gardens of prisons in Antalya were used as a festival areas as part of social responsibility projects, with screenplay workshops organized for prisoners and screens set up for prisoners and artists to view the films together every night during the festival. The director Alan Parker and screenwriter Oliver Stone of the Oscar-winning film Midnight Express, which was set in a Turkish prison, as well as Billy Hayes, who wrote the source book, were invited to attend one such screening. According to new regulations, the winning filmmaker will be granted half of the TL 330,000 cash prize (TL 165,000) on March 31, 2011. The remaining amount will be granted only if the filmmaker starts working on a new project within two years after the prize win. An additional TL 70,000, billed by the organizers as the Antalya Incentive Prize, will be granted only if part of the movie is filmed in Antalya, thus bringing the sum to TL 400,000. The winner of the best director award will get TL 50,000, while best screenplay gets TL 30,000. A total of eight books, including biographies or tributes, were published for the festival under the name of Golden Orange Publications.

Thomas Raven, a clergyman of the Church of England, who had considerable talent as an amateur artist, as may be seen from six water-colour drawings by him in the South Kensington Museum. John Raven was, however, almost entirely self-taught, initially by studying the works of John Crome and John Constable. He exhibited at the Academy as early as 1845, and his works also appeared at the British Institution. This part of his career was focused on views of the area where he lived, near St. Leonards. He at first fell under the influence of the Norwich school, but his maturer works, which show much poetic feeling, bear traces of pre- Raphaelitism. It was his custom to prepare elaborate cartoons for his pictures. He was drowned while bathing at Harlech in 1877. He married Margaret Sinclair Dunbar in 1869, later Mrs. William B. Morris.

Description and history Greenwich's Putnam Hill area became a secondary center to the town (after Old Greenwich) at least as early as 1702, when the Second Congregational Church was located there. It was also home to Greenwich's town hall between 1825 and 1874, which was located where the town's Civil War memorial now stands. During the American Revolutionary War it was the scene of an escape of Continental Army General Israel Putnam from surrounding British forces by riding his horse down the steep hill from the Putnam Cottage, a feat that gave the area its present name. The Putnam Cottage, formerly Knapp's Tavern, was built about 1700, and is now a museum. In the years after the American Civil War, the area developed as a fashionable residential area, with several fine period residences surviving, including the Chateauesque Tomes-Higgins House, which was designed by architect Calvert Vaux. It was also where Boss Tweed had his country estate. The district is basically linear in extent, running from Millbank Drive in the west to Old Church Road in the east.

It lies to the southeast of Key Largo, within the Key Largo Existing Management Area, which is immediately to the east of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. This reef is within a Sanctuary Preservation Area (SPA). The reef was marked by an unmanned reef light for most of the 20th century. On August 4, 1984, the motor vessel Wellwood, a 122-meter freighter carrying pelletized chicken feed, ran aground on Molasses Reef. The total destruction from the grounding included 5,805 square meters of living corals and injury to 75,000 square meters of reef habitat. The vessel was removed by the US Coast Guard. NOAA coordinated an effort to restore damage to the reef, by placing reef modules in the injured areas to provide a substrate for new coral colonization. Biological restoration took place using transplants from Pickles Reef and the facilitation of coral larval settlement. NOAA settled a claim worth $6.275 million with the responsible parties, the Wellwood Shipping Company (owner of the vessel) and the Hanseatic Shipping Company (shipping management company), in 1986, and all payments to NOAA were completed by 2001.Wellwood Coral Reef Restoration Project, accessed 12 January 2011 Molasses Reef is a popular scuba diving and snorkeling location with numerous dive sites marked by mooring buoys. One notable site is at buoy #7 and is variously referred to as the Winch Hole, Windlass Wreck, or The Winch. Here lies the large mechanical winch from the Slobadana, a 170-foot wooden hulled schooner that sank in 1887 after only three years in service. In addition to the winch itself, various mechanical artifacts are scattered over the nearby area. Also, large coral formations with (relatively) deep channels between them make this a popular dive location.

He moved with his family as a child to Zhitomir, where he later attended the four-year state rabbinical high school. He then went on to study law at Odessa University for one year, and completed his studies at Kiev University and upon completion of his studies, began to practice law in Kiev. He practiced law throughout his life, barely managing to make a living. In 1903 he moved to Belgium to work as a legal adviser for a firm there; upon falling ill in 1905, he returned to Kiev, where he died two years later. According to Prilutsky, Warshawsky spoke in the Yiddish dialect of the Volyn region. Under the influence of Abraham Goldfaden, Warshawsky started to write songs and sing them in his circle of friends accompanied by a fortepiano. He did not take his musical work seriously and never recorded those songs, relying only on his memory. Many of his works spread throughout the Jewish community of the Ukrainian region of the Russian Empire simply through repeated performance and most were adopted as folk songs. In 1890 Warshawsky met with Sholem Aleichem. After listening to his songs, Sholem Aleichem wrote \\"I simply hugged him and kissed him!\\" And then, Later, with Aleichem's full cooperation, Warshawsky published his first collection, Yiddishe Volkslider (Jewish People's songs, Kiev, 1900) with a hearty foreword from the great writer, Aleichem. The book was republished not only in Russia, but abroad as well. The collection included such songs as Der Alef-Beis (commonly known as Oyfn Pripetshik), A Brif fun Amerike, and Der Zeide mit der Babe. The songs described the everyday life of Jews in the Russian Empire. Together Sholem Aleichem and Warshawsky started to tour Russia performing their own repertoires. They also planned to travel to the United States; however, those plans were unfulfilled when Warshawsky suddenly became ill and died on November 26, 1907. The second edition of the Warshawsky's songs was published in Odessa in 1914, and then in New York (1948) and Buenos-Aires (1958).

Based at the Trinity Street Ground in Barry, the club was one of the first professional Welsh teams, formed in 1908 but folding after just a single season. Club history =Formation= At the beginning of the 20th century, rugby union was the sport of choice for most villages and towns.R League: The day Wales made history Wales Online, 23 December 2007 Association football was viewed as a north Wales activity, and cricket was the summer game. At the end of the 19th century, clubs in the north of England had broken away from the International Rugby Board, and started a professional version of rugby which later became known as rugby league. Rugby union was a strict amateur sport, and any player or club that took any form of payment were likely to be suspended from the game. This was very difficult to administer, as clubs were beginning to experience their star players \\"Going North\\", to the professional game where they would be paid to play rugby. In 1907, two rugby league teams formed in South Wales and joined the Northern Union, they were Ebbw Vale and Merthyr Tydfil. This led to further clubs considering the switch to the Northern Union game, Barry being one of them.History of Welsh Clubs Wales Rugby League In 1908, the Barry Herald reported that Barry was 'going strong for a NU club'.Lush (1998), pg. 30 A meeting was held soon after at the Windsor Hotel in Barry, presided over by a Mr J. White, where the discussion was to form a Northern Union club. In August, the Herald predicted that 'Barry will loom large in the football world', and that 'crack NU Rugby teams from the North of England' were expected to visit. The club formed soon after and the local Trinity Street ground was acquired as the team pitch while the team colours would be the same as Cardiff Rugby Football Club, that is Cambridge Blue jerseys and socks and black shorts. To run the professional club a company needed to be formed, so with capital of ¬£250 in 10 s shares Barry Northern Union Rugby Football Club Ltd. was formed. These subscribers came from all parts of the town who needed to present a minimum of 50s cash subscription or ¬£5 to qualify for the board of directors. For match days, Barry Railway Company offered 'special facilities' for those travelling from Cardiff and the Rhondda Valleys. =1908-1909 season= Barry's first game under the Northern Union rules was against fellow newly formed Welsh team, Treherbert, on 5 September 1908. The game was played at home, and a 'large crowd' watched Barry win their first match 6-3. A week later the team travelled by train from Barry to the West Yorkshire to face their first Northern team, Keighley. Barry were outclassed, and lost the match 31-0, though the eight-and-a-half-hour journey to reach the venue may have had an effect. The next match was played at home, and Barry faced another major team from England, this time Leeds. Barry lost the game 17-3 in front of just 2000 paying spectators; and this number generally declined as the season progressed. Barry lost their third game in a row when they faced Ebbw Vale, but then managed their second Northern Rugby League win when they defeated Aberdare 13-5. However, on 17 October, in an away fixture to Ebbw Vale, a depleted Barry lost 37-0 and then a 'very weak team' lost 6-31 to Widnes. Despite 'probably the best gate of the season', Barry's home encounter with Oldham was a terrible result, losing by 54-0. Then in an away fixture to Merthyr, Barry could only field 11 players, with their club secretary having to fill in at full-back. Results continued to be poor, with defeats to Mid- Rhondda, Aberdare, Keighley and Treherbert. On 12 December the team was drawn to play Aberdare in the first round of the Challenge Cup, and managed to acquire a few new players, leading to a rare 9-5 home win.Lush (1998), pg. 31 Barry then failed to show for a Welsh League encounter with Ebbw Vale, and their progress in the Challenge Cup was halted by a home defeat to Mid- Rhondda. This was the start of a seven-game losing streak.Lush (1998), pg. 259 Their losing run was broken on 20 February 1909, when the team would first beat Northern opposition, Widnes. The match, played at Trinity Street, saw a large crowd assembled to see the club's newest recruit, Dickie David. David, an ex-Cardiff and Wigan player who had been capped for the Wales rugby union team, failed to show for the game, saying he could not appear due to business. Even without their new star player Barry were victorious winning 12-6 despite trailing 2-6 at half time. This would be Barry's final win, as their last four games ended in defeat, including heavy losses to Leeds (56-0)Battles with the Welsh TheRhinos.co.uk and Ebbw Vale (38-0). Barry ended the season bottom of the Welsh League, and in the Northern Rugby League they finished 29th out of 31 clubs with 3 wins, no draws and 15 losses. =Club dissolution= In June 1909 Barry were named as defaulters by the Northern Rugby League. On 12 June 1909, the Athletic News reported that 'Barry had failed to fulfil the conditions laid down by the Committee' of the NRL and that they were 'practically expelled'. The club never played any further matches and the business was formerly dissolved in 1913.

This meeting turned into the Philadelphia Convention, which subsequently drafted the United States Constitution.

In 1788, the United States Constitution was ratified. The Constitution established an independent zone known as the District of Columbia for the seat of the new government. The Residence Act of 1790 provided for the new capital to be located on the Potomac River, and President George Washington was authorized by the United States Congress to determine the exact location (which he did a year later).Furer, Howard B.

This left in doubt the exact position of the District's border with Virginia (just as Maryland's southern border remained in doubt). Chief Justice John Marshall, whose heirs were party to the suit. Shortly after the creation of the District of Columbia, the United States government sold certain plots of land to James M. Marshall; his brother, John Marshall (later Chief Justice of the United States); John L. Kidwell; the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company; and several others.Gutheim, Frederick A. and Lee, Antoinette J. Worthy of the Nation: Washington, D.C., From L'Enfant to the National Capital Planning Commission. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, p. 95-96. Maryland and Virginia agreed to arbitrate their dispute, and in 1877 the Black-Jenkins Award (as the decision of the arbitration panel is known) placed Virginia's boundary with Maryland at the low-water mark on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. In 1882, Congress passed legislation providing for the dredging of the Potomac River, and for the dredged material to be used to fill in various tidal basins, marshes, and shores. This created extensive new land along the northern shore of the Potomac River‚Äîland which adjoined that of the heirs of James Marshall, John Marshall, and John Kidwell, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company. Congress passed legislation in August 1886 directing the Attorney General of the United States to protect the interests of the United States to the new land, and giving the courts jurisdiction over these claims. The heirs and other claimants sued to win title to the lands. Decision =Majority opinion= Associate Justice George Shiras, Jr. wrote the majority opinion for the Court, joined by Chief Justice Melville Fuller and Justices John Marshall Harlan, David Josiah Brewer, and Henry Billings Brown. Justice Shiras first laid out the facts of the case in a lengthy syllabus, and established various classes of claimants.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 198-223. The first issue Justice Shiras confronted was whether any of the parties could lay claim to the bed of the Potomac River (and thus the reclaimed lands built by the government).Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 222-223. Shiras held that none of the heirs on the Virginia side of the river could make any claim to the riverbed. Neither Lord Colepeper, his heir Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, nor any of Fairfax's heirs had ever seriously asserted title to the riverbed, and the Black-Jenkins Award clearly re-established that the boundary of Virginia ended at the low-water mark and did not extend to the riverbed.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 226. Relying on the Supreme Court's previous decision in Martin v. Waddell, 41 U.S. 367 (1842), Justice Shiras argued that none of the Maryland landholders could claim title to the riverbed, either. The majority held the original landholders were to hold the river and its bed in trust for the public, and that after the American Revolution these public trusts passed into the possession of the state (in this case, Maryland and in due time the District of Columbia).Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 227-228. Shiras distinguished Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. 603 (1813) by noting that Fairfax's Devisee did not involve Maryland or any Marylander claimant.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 230. Even if the riverbed had been assigned to Lord Fairfax and his heirs, Shiras concluded, the logic of Martin v. Waddell still held and delivered the lands into the control of the federal government.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 231. The majority dismissed the Kidwell heirs' claim to the newly created land under the same reasoning applied to the Marshall heirs. However, Kidwell's heirs noted that Congress had conveyed the property to Kidwell under a resolution adopted on February 16, 1839. The majority held, however, that Congress did not intend by that resolution to convey the riverbed.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 234. The majority relied heavily on the discussion in Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois, 146 U.S. 387 (1892), Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1 (1894), and Mann v. Tacoma Land Company, 153 U.S. 273 (1894),Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 236-238. and from the express language of the resolution (which withheld from the grant any lands for public purposes).Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 242. Shiras produced a highly detailed history of the establishment of the boundaries of the District of Columbia, the plots within its boundaries, and how these plots were conveyed to the private landowners.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 246-266. He concluded that none of the survey reports conveyed an interest in any riverbed. Shiras also noted that in Potomac Steam-Boat Co. v. Upper Potomac Steam-Boat Co., 109 U.S. 672 (1884), the Supreme Court had held that public streets were not part of any plot, and that Water Street (which bounded the Kidwell land to the south) distinctly separated the private land not only from the street itself but also from the newly created lands beyond it.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 266-269. As for the canal company's claims, the majority held that since none of the private landowners held riparian rights, the company could not obtain such rights from the private landowners.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 271-272. Nor was there any evidence that Congress was relinquishing its rights to Water Street or the river.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 273. The court dismissed the claims of the last landowners, whose property lay between Water Street and the shore, as being improperly based on unofficial land recordsMorris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 276. and for being based on maps and other documents which did not accurately reflect the physical land.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 277-288. The judgment was affirmed. =Dissent= Justice Edward Douglass White, joined by Justice Rufus Wheeler Peckham, dissented. Justice White concluded that nothing in the record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the riparian water rights of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 292-293. White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to the federal government.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 295-300. There could be no doubt, White argued, that the private landowners intended to give all of their riparian rights to the federal government, and there could be no doubt that the federal government intended to give all riparian rights to those to whom it sold the land.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 300-301. The majority's argument led to a tautology in which no riparian rights existed.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 307. Justice White also examined the conveyance of the federal government's land to the new private landowners in depth as well.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 311-343. In his discussion, White interpreted the \\"incorrect\\" maps as indicating the riparian rights to which the new private landowners were entitled (rather than a problem of inaccurate mapping). White concluded several times that the federal government fully intended to convey riparian rights to the new landowners because the government and its agents repeatedly indicated in letters, memoranda, contracts of sale, and other documents and statements its expectation that the waterside landowners were to build and maintain docks, wharves, and quays and improve the riparian rights they enjoyed. To assume otherwise, White concluded, was nonsensical. Either the federal government intended to convey riparian rights, or the government deceptively contemplated building Water Street and cutting the new landowners off from their access. \\"...the first hypothesis is the one naturally to be assumed.\\"Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 343. \\"The contracts for the sale of water lots with riparian rights attached, the reports of the surveyors, and the action of the commissioners, all blend into a harmonious and perfect whole, working from an original conception to a successful consummation of a well-understood result. The contrary view produces discord and disarrangement...\\"Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 311-347. White also discussed the District of Columbia's lengthy history regarding the regulation of wharves and docks.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 348-357. In his view, the city's treatment of the wharves demonstrated that the wharves were private property on private riverbed land, not private property licensed to be emplaced on a riverbed held in the public trust.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 357. White interpreted Potomac Steam-Boat Co. as superimposing an easement on top of existing riparian water rights.Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196, 358. It was not, as the majority held, the government's purpose all along to bound the plots of land with Water Street. Justice White would have overturned the judgment of the lesser court for determination of the riparian rights of the landowners in question. Assessment In Morris v. United States, the Supreme Court dealt with what was known as a \\"top common,\\" a tract of land between a river and the land intended to be occupied and sold to private landowners.Martin, Thomas C. \\"Haunted By History: Colonial Land Trusts Post National Threat.\\" William & Mary Law Review. 48:303 (October 2006), p. 311, n.54. Such practices were common in colonial America. Morris v. United States is considered an important case in the evolution of the law of rivers, streams, lakes, and other bodies of water, for it established that such bodies of water and their beds belonged to the public in common and were held in trust by the state for its citizens.Schultz, Jr., Warren M. \\"Property‚ÄîClassifying Bodies of Water as Lakes or Streams.\\" Tulane Law Review. 49:208 (November 1974), p. 213.Wilkinson, Charles F. \\"Symposium on the Public Trust and the Waters of the American West: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow: Introduction and Overview: The Headwaters of the Public Trust: Some Thoughts on the Source and Scope of the Traditional Doctrine.\\" Environmental Law. 19:425 (Spring 1989), p. 455, n.122. The Supreme Court further developed this public trust doctrine in Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois in 1892 and more recently in Utah Division of State Lands v. United States, 482 U.S. 193, 203 (1987). See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 174 * Maryland v.

It was ported to the MSX, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, Commodore 16, Acorn Electron, and BBC Micro (all in 1987) and the Amstrad CPC (1988). It is a puzzle game based on the \\"rocks and diamonds\\" mechanics of Boulder Dash. Gameplay Start of the first game level (Electron) The game is set in 2087 in a 'hibernation dome' which has been damaged in a nuclear war. It holds 1000 survivors (who are in stasis) but cannot be accessed by humans because of fallen earth and boulders. The player must control three droids to gain access to, and teleport out, the survivors. The dome is also populated by guardian droids that had been left to maintain life support functions but have been damaged by the nuclear fallout and become hostile. The survivors must all be evacuated before the time limit runs out and the radiation becomes too strong. The game uses the 'rocks and diamonds' mechanics as popularised in the game Boulder Dash whereby the player can dig through earth and push boulders but where boulders will fall from above if area below them is cleared. With the emphasis more on the puzzle element, Survivors is closer to Repton. The main twist with this game is that each droid can only perform one of the functions usually carried out by the player in similar games. The player must switch between droids depending on what they need to do. Droid 1 can tunnel through earth, Droid 2 can teleport survivors home (this game's equivalent of collecting diamonds) and Droid 3 can push boulders. This means that if any droid is trapped or destroyed then the game cannot be completed. The droids lose energy if a boulder falls on top of them or if they touch one of the faulty guardian droids. The guardian droids can be destroyed by dropping boulders on them or trapped behind boulders. Reception The game was first released for the ZX Spectrum, where it received mixed reviews. Complaints included 'jerky movement'\\"Survivors\\", C&VG;, Issue 64\\"Survivors\\", Crash, Issue 37, February 1987 and dull graphics and sound but praise was given for playability and value for money.\\"Survivors\\", Your Sinclair, Issue 14 Crash awarded an overall score of 70%, Your Sinclair gave it 6/10 and C&VG; only gave marks between 4/10 and 5/10 (without awarding an overall score). The game was then ported to a number of other formats where it received generally more positive reviews. Zzap!64 gave the C64 version a score of 79%, concluding that the game was \\"taxing both mentally and dexterously and Boulderdash fans suffering from withdrawal symptoms should enjoy Survivors quite a lot\\".\\"Survivors\\", Zzap!64, Issue 33, Christmas 1987 The Micro User was even more complimentary, commenting that it \\"could well knock Repton off its perch\\", and Electron User awarded it the 'Golden Game' title with an overall score of 9/10 (including 10/10 for both playability and value for money).

Along with a few other instructors, including Simon of Southwell, Honorius of Kent, and possibly Nicholas de Aquila, John was among the first securely attested legal teachers at Oxford. While at Oxford he lectured on the Decretum Gratiani and was one of the teachers of Thomas of Marlborough, later writer of the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham. It is not quite clear when John taught Thomas, but Thomas attests in his Chronicon that John was one of Thomas' teachers.Boyle \\"Beginnings of Legal Studies\\" Viator pp. 110‚Äì112 Nothing else is known of John's early life or where he studied law,Brundage Medieval Canon Law pp. 220‚Äì221 but presumably like other early English canon lawyers, he studied somewhere on the Continent before returning to England to teach or practice. It is possible that he served as a canon of Lincoln Cathedral during the 1190s, but this is not securely attested.Lewis \\"Canonists and Law Clerks\\" Seven Studies p. 60 By the late 1190s, John was a member of the household of Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Knorr \\"Tynemouth, John of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Besides Walter, another of his patrons was Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen.Scammell Hugh du Puiset p. 70 In 1203 John was employed in pleading at Rome on the Hubert Walter's behalf in a case against Gerald of Wales. While returning from Rome, John was captured and held for ransom. He informed his captors that Gerald would also be passing by, thus ensuring Gerald's capture. Gerald's revenge was to inform the kidnappers that John's income was over 100 marks a year, which meant that the kidnappers required a large ransom before releasing John. John was eventually rescued by John Bellesmains, a fellow Englishman and former Archbishop of Lyon.Cheney Hubert Walter p. 165 John held the rectorship of Upminster, Essex, by 1204. By 25 June 1206, John was holding the prebend of Langford Ecclesia in the Diocese of Lincoln and it is unclear when he relinquished this position.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Prebendaries: Langford Ecclesia Sometime between 1210 and 1212 he became Archdeacon of Oxford in the Diocese of Lincoln, perhaps during 1211. His predecessor in office was the chronicler Walter Map.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Archdeacons: Oxford In 1203 the medieval chronicler Thomas of Marlborough, who was a monk of Evesham Abbey, pleaded a case for Evesham before Hubert Walter and later, in his chronicle, he noted that John, Simon of Southwell, and Honorius of Kent, by now all canon lawyers in the archbishop's household, sided with the abbey. He also described the three men as magistri mei in scholis (roughly, \\"my school teachers\\"). Surviving evidence shows that Simon and John frequently found themselves on opposing sides of cases, which suggests a rivalry between the two over their expositions of canon law.Young Hubert Walter pp. 56‚Äì57 During the papal interdict on England during King John's reign, John of Tynemouth remained in England. He also served as a papal judge-delegate on several occasions. He died in 1221, between 25 March and August. This date of death is only recorded in a medieval work, the Annals of Dunstable, often felt to be the work of another canonist, Richard de Mores.Sharpe Handlist of Latin Writers p. 332 Writings Some of John's writings, dealing with canon law, still survive. They show him to have been steeped in canon law and quite knowledgeable. In his writings, he often cited earlier canonists or theologians as well as contemporary writers.Weignad \\"Transmontane Decretists\\" History of Medieval Canon Law pp. 200‚Äì201 A number of the glosses on a late-twelfth-century copy of Gratian's Decretum are ascribed to John. These take the form of notes from his lectures that were later added to the margins of copies of the Decretum. This combined work is now at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University, catalogued as manuscript (MS) 283/676. Another set of student notes from his lectures, this time entitled Quaestiones, survives as part of British Library MS Royal E.VII. This work includes lectures notes not only from John's classes, but from Simon and Nicholas' as well. He also was addressed as magister, testifying to his learning.

The application had both a consumer and enterprise component. Companies, educational institutions, and organizations could build challenges, the core unit of their game, at places on SCVNGR from the web. The service also supported SMS. SCVNGR is building a game \\"layer\\" on top of the world. Players could earn points by going places and doing challenges, and could broadcast where they were and their activities to their friends on Facebook and Twitter. By doing challenges, players could unlock badges and real-world rewards, such as discounts or free items. By June 2010, over 1000 companies, educational institutions, and organizations had built on SCVNGR by creating challenges (and often rewards) at their locations. In February 2011, it was speculated that SCVNGR had reached over 1 million users. In March 2011, SCVNGR launched LevelUp, a mobile payments platform to increase engagement and loyalty at local businesses. Examples of SCVNGR use in education At educational institutions, SCVNGR was mostly utilized as a tool for orientation for prospective and new students to college campuses (for example at the University of Louisville in Kentucky). Rather than having a traditional tour guide approach to orientation, colleges used the SCVNGR application to entice students to visit places they want students to know about, to receive rewards and as an icebreaker for meeting new people. The app was also used for orientation to campus libraries; for example, librarians from Boise State University and Oregon State University have created SCVNGR hunts and documented its use for library introductions for international students and bibliographic instruction.

The website has been described by true crime author and Investigation Discovery personality David Lohr, who is currently a writer and journalist for AOL News, as \\"One of the top selling murderabilia outlets\\". History Founder Eric Holler, who uses the nom de plume \\"Eric Gein\\" (an homage to Ed Gein according to a New York Times article) came up with the concept of Serial Killers Ink in the mid-1990s after he began writing to inmates and collecting their artwork and craft items. A friend of Holler's suggested he list items on eBay and offer them for sale. eBay banned the sale of murderabilia in 2001. In 2006, Holler began writing and corresponding with inmates once again in preparation of building a new website. In December 2008, the website launched and in February 2009, the website was redesigned to include a store to sell art, letters, hair and clothing obtained from infamous and news-worthy inmates.

Life  Glinos was born in Smyrna, the eldest of twelve children of Alexandros Glinos. After graduating from the Smyrna Evangelical School, he went to Athens in 1899 and enrolled in the Philosophy Department of the University of Athens. He graduated in 1905 and proceeded to study philosophy, pedagogy, and experimental psychology in Germany at the University of Jena (under Rudolf Eucken from 1908 to 1909), and at the University of Leipzig (under Wilhelm Wundt from 1909 to 1911).

He married Anna Chroni in September 1908. Upon his return to Greece, he submitted a proposal for an educational reform to the government in 1913. He proposed introduction of, and changes to: * The language of instruction (using colloquial Demotic Greek instead of the old-fashioned Katharevousa). Glinos proposed even the use of the Latin alphabet, in the place of Greek, for tonic reasons. * The structure of the school system (extend primary school from 4 to 6 years) * Educational content (less formalism, greater emphasis on science) * Educational methods (updating of courses and materials) * Teacher training * The education of girls Glinos eventually became Secretary-General of the Ministry of Education in 1917 under prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos, and began to introduce the proposed reforms. His efforts were stopped and his reforms undone when Venizelos lost power in 1920, and Glinos began publishing under the pseudonym \\"A. Gabriel, teacher\\". He re-introduced the reforms after he was reinstated when Venizelos regained power in 1922, but dampened again when Theodore Pangalos took power in 1925. Glinos' booklet \\"What is the National Liberation Front and what does it want\\", 1944 re-issue In 1930 he began his active involvement in politics, being elected as an MP with the Communist Party of Greece in the 1936 elections. After the establishment of the Metaxas Regime, along with many other Communists and other political dissidents, he was sent to internal exile on the island of Agios Efstratios. During the Axis Occupation of Greece, Glinos became actively involved in the founding of the Communist-led National Liberation Front (EAM), and wrote its political manifesto, What is the National Liberation Front, and what does it want (Œ§ŒØ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒØ Œ∏Œ≠ŒªŒµŒπ œÑŒø ŒïŒëŒú) in September 1942.

The signalizer functor theorem gives conditions under which a signalizer functor comes from a subgroup. The idea is to try to construct a p'-subgroup of a finite group G, which has a good chance of being normal in G, by taking as generators certain p'-subgroups of the centralizers of nonidentity elements in one or several given noncyclic elementary abelian p-subgroups of G. The technique has origins in the Feit‚ÄìThompson theorem, and was subsequently developed by many people including who defined signalizer functors, who proved the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem for solvable groups, and who proved it for all groups. This theorem is needed to prove the so-called \\"dichotomy\\" stating that a given nonabelian finite simple group either has local characteristic two, or is of component type. It thus plays a major role in the classification of finite simple groups. Definition Let A be a noncyclic elementary abelian p-subgroup of the finite group G. An A-signalizer functor on G or simply a signalizer functor when A and G are clear is a mapping Œ∏ from the set of nonidentity elements of A to the set of A-invariant p‚Ä≤-subgroups of G satisfying the following properties: *For every nonidentity a\\\\in A, the group \\\\theta(a) is contained in C_G(a). *For every nonidentity a, b\\\\in A, we have \\\\theta(a) \\\\cap C_G(b) \\\\subseteq \\\\theta(b). The second condition above is called the balance condition. If the subgroups \\\\theta(a) are all solvable, then the signalizer functor \\\\theta itself is said to be solvable. Solvable signalizer functor theorem Given \\\\theta, certain additional, relatively mild, assumptions allow one to prove that the subgroup W= \\\\langle \\\\theta(a) \\\\mid a \\\\in A, a eq 1\\\\rangle of G generated by the subgroups \\\\theta(a) is in fact a p'-subgroup. The Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem proved by Glauberman and mentioned above says that this will be the case if \\\\theta is solvable and A has at least three generators. The theorem also states that under these assumptions, W itself will be solvable. Several earlier versions of the theorem were proven: proved this under the stronger assumption that A had rank at least 5. proved this under the assumption that A had rank at least 4 or was a 2-group of rank at least 3. gave a simple proof for 2-groups using the ZJ theorem, and a proof in a similar spirit has been given for all primes by . gave the definitive result for solvable signalizer functors. Using the classification of finite simple groups, showed that W is a p'-group without the assumption that \\\\theta is solvable. =Completeness= The terminology of completeness is often used in discussions of signalizer functors. Let \\\\theta be a signalizer functor as above, and consider the set –ò of all A-invariant p'-subgroups H of G satisfying the following condition: *H\\\\cap C_G(a) \\\\subseteq \\\\theta(a) for all nonidentity a \\\\in A. For example, the subgroups \\\\theta(a) belong to –ò by the balance condition. The signalizer functor \\\\theta is said to be complete if –ò has a unique maximal element when ordered by containment. In this case, the unique maximal element can be shown to coincide with W above, and W is called the completion of \\\\theta. If \\\\theta is complete, and W turns out to be solvable, then \\\\theta is said to be solvably complete. Thus, the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem can be rephrased by saying that if A has at least three generators, then every solvable A-signalizer functor on G is solvably complete. Examples of signalizer functors The easiest way to obtain a signalizer functor is to start with an A-invariant p'-subgroup M of G, and define \\\\theta(a) = M\\\\cap C_G(a) for all nonidentity a \\\\in A. In practice, however, one begins with \\\\theta and uses it to construct the A-invariant p'-group. The simplest signalizer functor used in practice is this: \\\\theta(a) = O_{p'}(C_G(a)). A few words of caution are needed here. First, note that \\\\theta(a) as defined above is indeed an A-invariant p'-subgroup of G because A is abelian. However, some additional assumptions are needed to show that this \\\\theta satisfies the balance condition. One sufficient criterion is that for each nonidentity a \\\\in A, the group C_G(a) is solvable (or p-solvable or even p-constrained). Verifying the balance condition for this \\\\theta under this assumption requires a famous lemma, known as Thompson's P\\\\times Q-lemma. (Note, this lemma is also called Thompson's A \\\\times B-lemma, but the A in this use must not be confused with the A appearing in the definition of a signalizer functor!) Coprime action To obtain a better understanding of signalizer functors, it is essential to know the following general fact about finite groups: *Let E be an abelian noncyclic group acting on the finite group X. Assume that the orders of E and X are relatively prime. Then X = \\\\langle C_X(E_0) \\\\mid E_0 \\\\subseteq E, \\\\text{ and } E/E_0 \\\\text{ cyclic }\\\\rangle To prove this fact, one uses the Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem to show that for each prime q dividing the order of X, the group X has an E-invariant Sylow q-subgroup. This reduces to the case where X is a q-group. Then an argument by induction on the order of X reduces the statement further to the case where X is elementary abelian with E acting irreducibly. This forces the group E/C_E(X) to be cyclic, and the result follows. See either of the books or for details. This is used in both the proof and applications of the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem. To begin, notice that it quickly implies the claim that if \\\\theta is complete, then its completion is the group W defined above. Normal completion The completion of a signalizer functor has a \\"good chance\\" of being normal in G, according to the top of the article. Here, the coprime action fact will be used to motivate this claim. Let \\\\theta be a complete A-signalizer functor on G Let B be a noncyclic subgroup of A. Then the coprime action fact together with the balance condition imply that W= \\\\langle \\\\theta(a) \\\\mid a \\\\in A, a eq 1\\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\theta(b) \\\\mid b \\\\in B, b eq 1\\\\rangle . To see this, observe that because \\\\theta(a) is B-invariant, we have \\\\theta(a) = \\\\langle \\\\theta(a) \\\\cap C_G(b) \\\\mid b \\\\in B, b eq 1\\\\rangle \\\\subseteq \\\\langle \\\\theta(b) \\\\mid b \\\\in B, b eq 1\\\\rangle. The equality above uses the coprime action fact, and the containment uses the balance condition. Now, it is often the case that \\\\theta satisfies an \\"equivariance\\" condition, namely that for each g \\\\in G and nonidentity a \\\\in A \\\\theta(a^g) = \\\\theta(a)^g. \\\\, The superscript denotes conjugation by g. For example, the mapping a \\\\mapsto O_{p'}(C_G(a)) (which is often a signalizer functor!) satisfies this condition. If \\\\theta satisfies equivariance, then the normalizer of B will normalize W. It follows that if G is generated by the normalizers of the noncyclic subgroups of A, then the completion of \\\\theta (i.e. W) is normal in G.

The concept is controversial, especially in view of fundamental societal disagreement over the definition and importance of virginity. The archetypal case is of a woman who falsely claims to be a virgin for the sake of marriage to a man whom she suspects of insisting on, or at least valuing, virginity in his bride. (Other situations ‚Äì such as two lovers who claimed to lose their virginity together on the internet as a publicity stunt ‚Äì may technically qualify, but are rarely discussed in the same context.) Operating concept of virginity Female virginity may either be defined solely according to the presence or absence of a hymen, or else according to more ambiguous, philosophical criteria. In many societies, for a woman to date or have boyfriends ‚Äì even if refraining from full sexual intercourse ‚Äì would already be viewed as a violation of traditional values. (See technical virginity; honor killing.) On the other hand, lesbian sexual activity would not normally be an object of concern. Meanwhile, a rape victim would be viewed as having lost her virginity by force. An ancient East European Slavic wedding ritual involves relatives of the bride and/or groom waiting to receive the bloody sheet on which the bride was \\"deflowered\\", as \\"proof\\" of her former virginity (which would often be specified in the marriage contract). Techniques to simulate the bleeding and/or physical sensation of rupture are equally ancient. In rural Egypt, chicken blood is used if ‚Äì for whatever reason ‚Äì there is no real blood on the wedding night. The bloody sheet is then shown to the neighborhood as proof of virginity \\"deflowering\\". Methods of detection Several methods of \\"virginity fraud detection\\" claim to be available, but cannot adequately determine the status of virginity. #Inspection to determine whether hymen restoration surgery has been performed, and/or the vagina's general state of elasticity. In many societies, such inspections have traditionally been conducted by older female relatives of the prospective groom, but are increasingly performed by doctors, who may issue certificates of virginity for the benefit of the groom's family. Also, digital inspection may fail to detect surgical suture which are visible only by means of specialized medical instruments. However, this cannot adequately prove virginity. As the hymen and vagina are elastic, there have been cases where women have actually given birth and had their hymen return to its original state. Additionally, hymens can be broken through nonsexual activity such as horseback riding. #Background checks by a private detective aimed at uncovering a woman's romantic and/or medical history. This unfortunately relies on reporting of people who may have a score to settle with the woman being investigated. A number of attempts at virginity fraud are exposed by a woman's contact with medical clinics specializing in hymen restoration procedures. Public response In the Western world, awareness of hymen replacement surgery has led to criticisms of the procedure, on the grounds that it is medically unnecessary and contributes to pernicious social practices; alongside recognition that women's reasons for undergoing it are not frivolous (as might be claimed of other forms of elective plastic surgery). Little, if any, concern has been expressed for the intended victims of virginity fraud. Muslim responses have questioned the motives of women undergoing the procedure, as well as of prospective grooms whose attitudes have made the procedure so prevalent. In 2006, a French Muslim man in Lille sought an annulment on the grounds that his bride (also Muslim) turned out not to be a virgin. She denied having misled him, but did not contest the appeal, which was duly granted. In 2009, amidst a wave of media attention, French justice minister Rachida Dati ordered the government to appeal this decision (on the grounds that an important element of French public policy was at issue). Ronald Sokol, in an editorial for the Christian Science Monitor, writes that ::The question was whether the woman's virginity was an essential element of the marriage contract. If it was, then the contract could be annulled. If it was not, then the couple was validly married. The appeals court reversed the judgment. Sokol continues: ::The government argued that the wife's virginity was not an essential condition because her unchaste past has no effect on married life. The judges agreed. Even if she had lied, they said, it did not matter, as a woman's lies about her past love affairs are not matters essential to her married life. It became known as the \\"Virginity Lie\\" case.

Early life and RAF career Williams was born in Acton, London to a labourer and a cook. He won a scholarship to Acton County Grammar, leaving at 16 to train as an accountant at Acton Borough Council. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and was trained as a mechanic. After a time servicing Westland Wapiti biplanes in India, he was selected for pilot training. Posted to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Leading Aircraftman Williams became involved in the wider British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and joined the Initial Training Wing at Hillside, a suburb of Bulawayo. Basic flying training took place at Induna and advanced flying training at Thornhill. On 14 August 1943, Williams was commissioned into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a pilot officer and sent to the Middle East, where he gained experience of single-seat fighter aircraft. On 25 February 1944, he was posted to No. 225 Squadron RAF, at the time based at Lago airfield, 30 miles north of Naples, and equipped with Supermarine Spitfire Mk.V fighters. Williams flew his first operational sortie spotting for Allied artillery firing on a bridge at Ausonia, Lazio on 8 April 1944. Promoted to the rank of flying officer, Williams flew with No. 225 Squadron all through 1944 from a number of airstrips in Italy, Corsica and southern France. On 23 October that year he took off from Peretola with Flying Officer Stanley Waldman (brother of TV producer Ronnie Waldman) as wingman, to carry out a tactical reconnaissance to the Bologna-Ferrara-Cento-San Giovanni in Persiceto area. What happened on that mission was later narrated by Williams himself: Due to injuries sustained during his parachute jump, Williams was later admitted to hospital for some time. In January 1945, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The citation reads: Postwar career After the war, Williams qualified as an accountant and joined the Gas Council as chief internal auditor, then became finance officer of what was then the Cooperative Permanent Society in 1954. He stayed with the company for the remainder of his career, rising through the ranks to become chief executive in 1967 and chairman in 1982, by which time it had become the Nationwide Building Society. Williams became the best-known and most widely quoted spokesman for the building societies movement as deputy chairman, then chairman, of the Building Societies Association (BSA) from 1977 to 1981. He had the uncomfortable task of presiding over the BSA's decision to introduce the highest ever mortgage rate ‚Äì 15 per cent ‚Äì but at the same time he was an advocate of dismantling the building society interest rate cartel and the recommended mortgage rate system. In 1986, the Nationwide became the first society to take advantage of the opportunities opened up by the 1986 Building Societies Act to broaden out into banking services. The same year the society, by then the third biggest in the league, merged with the seventh largest society, Anglia. Williams served as chairman, then president, of the Nationwide Anglia until 1992. Among other appointments, he served as chairman of BUPA from 1988 to 1990. Under his leadership, Nationwide supported air tattoos and the RAF Benevolent Fund. Moreover, Williams was a life member of the RAF Club, of which he also served as a vice-chairman. Discovery and excavation of Spitfire crash site The remains of Williams' Spitfire were recovered in Galciana, Tuscany in late 2002. The aircraft was identified as an LF Mk.IX, s/n MH 768, equipped with a Merlin 66 engine and delivered on 19 September 1943 to 39 Maintenance Unit. On 24 October 1943 it was loaded onto SS Charlton Hall and shipped to Casablanca where it arrived the following 17 November. On 30 November it was assigned to 218 Group and employed on tactical reconnaissance missions in North Africa. From 28 September 1944 it was allotted to 225 Squadron operating from Peretola airfield. On 23 October 1944 it was shot down by Flak and abandoned by the pilot. It received Category E damage and subsequently it was stricken off register. The serial number also proved to be decisive in tracking down the pilot, who was able to return to the town exactly 59 years after the crash. To this day, the wreckage of Spitfire MH 768 is on display in the Gothic Line Museum in Montemurlo. References Bibliography RAF News, 14 November 2003. Intercom, Spring 2004.

She became MacBrayne's last surviving mailboat, seeing out her life as a floating bar in Bristol. History Lochiel was the first of two mailboats ordered in 1938; the second, was delayed until 1947. Built in 1939, she was the fourth MacBrayne's vessel named Lochiel. The earlier Lochiels had been single-screw steamers, two serving Islay. On 8 October 1960, Lochiel hit submerged rocks in West Loch Tarbert, Argyll and sank. She was raised by the salvage-tug Plantagenet, and was out of service until the following March. Liability for a car lost on this crossing was challenged in the courts, and decided in favour of the car owner by the House of Lords. When replaced as the Islay mailboat in 1970, she was sold to Norwest Shipping Ltd, Douglas, Isle of Man. Re-fitted on the Mersey, she emerging as Norwest Laird and had a short career operating between Fleetwood and Douglas. The service was not a success and her operator went bankrupt in August 1970. Late in 1974, she was acquired by Courage (Western) Ltd and was towed to Hayle in Cornwall, to be renovated for use as a floating bar and restaurant in Bristol. Her engines were removed in 1975, but it was 1978 before she reached Bristol. As \\"Old Lochiel\\", she became a popular haunt and survived until 1994. In November 1995, she was sold for scrap and broken up at Bristol that December. In Bristol, as a floating pub. Layout Lochiel had a single funnel, a steel mast and a derrick over the forward cargo-hold. An innovation for MacBrayne's was a cold store on the lower deck. A clear area of plated main-deck forward allowed carriage of cars or cattle. Her deck was strengthened to take a 4-inch gun. Her accommodation originally had two-classes, with the usual lounges, dining saloons and smoke- rooms. Officers cabins were on the lower deck, with the crew quarters in the forecastle at main-deck level. To cope with the shallow West Loch Tarbert, she was flat bottomed, resulting in much pitching and rolling in even slight seas. All her deck machinery was electrically powered. Her engines were flexibly mounted, to reduce vibration and noise. Oil-operated reverse reduction gearboxes were fitted, rather than an additional, heavy reversing engine. She was given a mainmast in 1953. Service MV Lochiel memorial garden, Port Ellen Although built for the Islay service, Lochiel started her career at Oban on the secondary Fort William schedule, until the pier at West Loch Tarbert was modified for her length and draught. Thereafter, she replaced and spent her entire career on the Islay service. She called at Port Askaig and Port Ellen, and also served Jura (Craighouse) and Gigha (by flit-boat). She was not requisitioned in World War II. In 1949, her schedule was extended to include regular runs to Colonsay. Derrick-loading continued at Islay, after the 1964 hoist-loading ferries joined the fleet. This was increasingly inconvenient and provided an opening for Western Ferries to operate an Islay service from Kennacraig. In January 1970, the 1954 former Clyde car ferry took over the MacBrayne Islay service and Lochiel was retired.

As of 2004, the LICC represented 800 Protestant churches, and had non-voting representatives from the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Jewish communities.Marcelle S. Fischler, \\"Long Island: Reaching Out, and Into a Turf Battle\\", The New York Times, September 12, 2004 It is located in Hempstead, New York. Mission statement The Council's mission statement is that it: \\"unites diverse Christians to work together to improve the well being of Long Islanders and to promote interfaith understanding and cooperation.\\" Its goal is also to: \\"promote understanding and cooperation between Christians and non-Christians\\". Specifically, the LICC works with health agencies and with social service agencies: > to provide emergency food, housing, medical assistance, transportation > assistance, chaplaincy services, disaster relief, and advocacy for a wide > range of social issues, including affordable housing, adequate health care, > the environment, social, racial and gender equality, anti-poverty and anti- > bias programs, prison reform, substance abuse and domestic violence > programs. History The LICC was formed in 1969, in a merger of the Nassau and Sullfolk County Councils of Churches. The Council has issued policy statements from time to time. on various issues. At times it has done so by itself, and in other instances it has done so jointly with other organizations, including the Long Island Board of Rabbis, and the Commission on Christian-Jewish Relations of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island. The Board of Governors of the LICC has energetically criticized both Hebrew Christians and Jews for Jesus.\\"Jews for Jesus Criticized\\", The Milwaukee Sentinel, August 6, 1977 In 1980, speaking of Jewish-Christian groups, including Messianic Judaism, it charged that \\"certain groups are engaging in subterfuge and dishonesty in representing the claims of their faith groups\\". In September 1999, it faced cuts coupled with a cumbersome contract-renewal process by Nassau County. It attempted to operate without a contract, but at the end of the day it had to furlough chaplains at a local medical center and geriatric center. In May 2000, Hope Koski became the LICC's first female president. Speaking of the Council, she said: > It's a way for the small and normally separated Protestant churches that > range from congregations of 20 to 30 people to congregations of thousands to > come together with a unified voice. It lets small congregations have some > strength from larger congregations, and larger congregations gain the > strength of smaller congregations. ... We work very hard for the social > integration of all Long Islanders with each other so that people aren't > afraid of each other. Anything we can do to lessen the fear of neighbors for > each other and of communities for people they don't know is well within our > range of interest. To make sure that peace reigns and make sure we have no > religious wars on Long Island. Lord knows, we don't need that. Leadership Clayton L. Williams served as the LICC's Executive Director in its formative years, as did Jack Alford in later years.Kevin LaHart, \\"What was once Bizarre has become Commonplace,\\", The Spokesman-Review, February 5, 1976 Rev. Thomas W. Goodhue, a United Methodist minister, has served as its Executive Director in more recent years.

Wingfield. It sees the slovenly, disorganised Detective Inspector Frost once again put under pressure to solve multiple complex cases in a short period of time, whilst attempting to avoid being sacked by his superior officers. Amongst his many enemies within the Denton Police is the newly transferred Detective Chief Inspector Skinner, who will stop at nothing to get Frost out of the job. Unlike all of the previous Frost novels, A Killing Frost was not adapted in to a television episode of A Touch of Frost. Plot The long- suffering Superintendent Mullet has enlisted the help of a new D.C.I, Skinner, to rid the Denton Police of Inspector Frost once-and-for-all. The pair see him as a hindrance to the Police Service, which is struggling to adapt to the modern era of Policing. Inspector Frost is his usual uncouth self; derogatory towards women and with a slightly perverse sense of humour, but through this we can see that in a way, they are right: Frost has no place in the modern Police Service and he knows it all-too-well. Meanwhile, Inspector Frost has to contend with missing children, severed body parts, rape cases and a man claiming to have killed his wife (even though she reports in as alive and living outside Denton). Every time Frost takes on a case, another seems to pop-up, and he begins to feel the strain. Things take an alarming turn for the worse as his nemesis discovers that Frost has been forging petrol receipts for some time (a crime for which D.I Frost could very easily be fired), Frost is cornered in an abandoned butcher's shop by a knife-wielding man and the whole situation is brought to an explosive end in an armed stand-off at a remote farmhouse.

She fled as a two- year-old child during the Minor Asia Catastrophe in 1922 with her parents to Thessaloniki and Greece, where she grew up. She was a very diligent student both in elementary school and in high school. Mando wanted to study medicine and applied to the School of Medicine in Athens, which was the only place in Greece that had medicine at that time. Dalianis was admitted to the school in 1938, but due to the German occupation of 1941‚Äì1944 her studies were delayed and she finalized her studies in medicine in 1947 and became a physician.

The Averoff prison was a women's prison where women were allowed to bring their children if they were below two years old.

She was released after 21 months without any charges. = Work as a psychiatrist and research = In 1955 Mando moved with her family to England and in 1960 to Sweden. She worked as a child psychiatrist at PBU (Psykiatriska Barn- och Ungdomsv√•rden), (Psychiatric Child and Youth Clinics) in S√∂dert√§lje and then in M√§rsta, Sweden and finally in 1980 with democracy starting in Greece she could trace down her inmates and their families and interview them about their life as parents that were imprisoned.

Uncovered during the demolition of a pre-Reformation church and its kirkyard wall in the 19th and 20th centuries, the stones are now housed in the collection of the Museum of Scotland. Location Stones located at St Regulus' (St Rule's) Church, Monifieth, Angus, Scotland () until 1870 (the stones known as Monifieth 1, 2, 3 and 4) or 1928 (Monifieth 5). Monifieth 4 was possibly originally located at St Bride's Ring, Kingennie () and moved to Monifieth in pre-Reformation times. All five are now housed in the collection of the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (). History Monifieth 1, rear face The church and lands of Monifieth were originally possessions of the ascetic C√©li D√© monastic order. The church was endowed to the recently founded Arbroath Abbey by Gille Cr√≠st, Earl of Angus around 1201‚Äì1207, and the lands to the south of the Church (now much reduced in size due to erosion) in 1242‚Äì1243 by Matilda, Countess of Angus. The materials of the Culdee buildings were apparently recycled when a new church building was erected at some point before the Reformation. This building was, in turn, demolished to make way for a new church in 1812. During the demolitions, \\"remains of the Culdee edifice\\" were found dating from before the church's acquisition by Arbroath Abbey. The pre- Reformation church also made use of the shaft of a high cross as a lintel for the \\"queer\\" door. According to Samuel Miller, minister at Monifieth during the time of the Second Statistical Account, this had been appropriated from a site several miles to the North at Kingennie, known as St Bride's Ring, the remains of a circular stone structure 30 metres in diameter, with walls 2 metres thick and 0.5 metres high. (). Miller's account refers to a large socketed boulder, some yards to north that once held the cross. This stone is now known as Monifieth 4. Of the artifacts found in the Church foundations, Jervise made note of two sculptured stones built into the fabric of the church walls. These two stones (now known as Monifieth 1 and Monifieth 2) were removed from the church walls to allow them to be sketched for John Stuart's The Sculptured Stones of Scotland, published in 1856. On a visit to the church by Cosmo Innes, Joseph Robertson and John Stuart in 1864, they were made aware of a fourth stone (Monifieth 3) that had been unearthed in a garden adjoining the church. These four stones were donated to the Museum of Antiquities (now part of the Museum of Scotland) in Edinburgh in 1870. A further high cross fragment was later found incorporated into the kirkyard wall. This bears similarity with Monifieth 4 and was donated to the Museum of Antiquities in 1928. Description =Monifieth 1= Monifeith 1 frontThe stone is an upright slab of grey sandstone, 0.72 metres tall, 0.36 metres wide and 0.15 metres thick. It is dressed, with designs carved in relief including both Christian and Pictish symbols, defining it as a Class II cross slab under J. Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system. The front face of the stone bears a notched Quadrate cross decorated with keywork designs, surrounded by a thick border around the edge of the stone. The rear face is unique in having double disc symbols both with and without Z-rod ornamentation. The unornamented double disc lies horizontally at the top and is decorated with spiral designs. The double disc and Z-rod lies vertically on the right hand side of the face and is decorated with concentric circles. On the left of the face is a comb symbol and, lying between the comb and double disc and Z-rod, is an area of damage, where a long rectangular section had been removed when the stone was incorporated into the fabric of St Regulas' Church. The lower portion of the rear face is heavily damaged, but a portion of the edge of a circular symbol remains. Given the presence of a comb symbol, this may have originally represented a mirror, typical of the relatively common mirror and comb pairing. This face also features a heavy border around the edge. =Monifieth 2= Monifeith 2 rear Monifieth 2 is another class II cross slab of grey sandstone, 0.45 metres tall by 0.3 metres wide by 0.08 metres thick. It has substantial areas of wear to the rear. The front again features a notched quadrate cross, with the central section featuring an angular knotwork design. The arms also have knotworks, whereas the shaft features a spiral design above a small keywork and the head has a further spiral design. On the rear face there are a variety of symbols. There are bird headed creatures incorporated into the upper border of the slab. The upper half of the slab holds two designs: on the left, a long-necked creature similar to that on one of the sides of Monifieth 4; on the right, a deer's head similar to that on the Class I stone at Dunachton and the Class II Glamis Manse stone. The lower right quadrant of the slab has a crescent and v-rod design and the lower left holds a worn figure, cloaked and bearing a halo, recently identified as the virgin Mary. =Monifieth 3= Another type II cross slab, Monifieth 3 is 0.45 metres by 0.58 metres by 0.08 metres. The front face features a defaced cross shaft with birds and animals at the sides. The rear features a figure on horseback, a crescent symbol, dog, fish monster, a dog chasing a stag and a pair of biting heads.The Canmore record is at odds with Neish's account of the donation, stating that Monifieth 3 was also found in the church foundations and incorporated into the 1812 building. =Monifieth 4= Monifeith 4 front The largest stone is a fragment of a free- standing high cross, 1.16 metres by 0.28 metres wide by 0.18 metres thick, once built into the front of St Regulus' Church and possibly originally from St Bride's Ring. While it features Celtic Christian imagery, it has no idiomatic Pictish symbols, defining it as Class III. The cross is broken at bottom of intersection with the arms. The upper portion of the front face is a crucifixion scene, with the portion of the Christ figure above the waist missing. Flanking his legs are two human figures. Below the crucifixion scene are two robed figures holding unidentifiable objects. Below them are a further two figures holding drinking horns and the bottom of the cross has a seated harpist, similar to that on the Dupplin Cross. The rear face features a ringed knotwork design above a back-biting creature. The sides of the cross also feature knotwork designs, above phantasmagorical creatures. =Monifieth 5= Monifieth 5 is another class III high cross fragment, broken under the arms. It measures 0.5 metres long, 0.2 metres wide and 0.1 metres thick. The front again features part of a crucifixion scene, with the Christ figure broken off at the waist. Flanking his legs are two figures. The lower part of the cross shaft is worn and any decoration has been worn away. The rear of the cross shaft is also too worn to interpret.

Chiarad√≠a was transferred to the Argentine Consulate in Frankfurt in 1993, and as Consul, directed the Center for Argentine Promotion. He was named Undersecretary for International Economic Negotiations, a key post in foreign debt negotiations, in 1994, and from 1996 to 1999, served as Undersecretary for Latin American Affairs for Foreign Minister Guido di Tella. A career diplomat, Chiarad√≠a served in a number of related posts for each of Argentina's short-lived governments in office over the next four years. He was the Ambassador to Japan until 2001, and Argentina's chief Trade Representative until August 2002, when he was named his nation's Representative to the World Trade Organization.

The engines drove two pairs of aluminium-bladed propellers mounted on brackets either side of the hull. Operating history Wreckage of passenger car of Schwaben after the fire The LZ 10 made its first flight on June 26, 1911 and was put into service three weeks later, on July 16, 1911. It was called the \\"lucky airship\\" because it was more successful than any of the previous craft that DELAG had put into service, and was the first commercially successful passenger aircraft in history. Over the course of the next year it made 218 flights, transporting 1,553 passengers. among whom were Crown Prince Wilhelm and his wife. The Prince, who had a pilot's license, travelled in the control car, while the Princess and her attendants occupied the passenger cabin for a flight over Berlin. Schwaben was destroyed in a gale on June 28, 1912 at the airfield near D√ºsseldorf, The wind prevented it being put into its shed, and it broke loose from its moorings and broke its back. The hydrogen was ignited by spark caused by static electricity accumulated in the rubberised cotton gasbags:Robinson 1973, p.61 in moments the entire ship had been burnt. Sources differ regarding injuries suffered: the New York Times reported \\"34 soldiers were injured\\"; others claimed either 30 or 40 injured.postcard image courtesy of Jean-Pierre Lauwers with caption: \\"28 Jun 1912, LZ 10 Schwaben met a fiery end on Golzheimer heide near D√ºsseldorf. ... forty persons were wounded. ...

Lucey Jr. (born November 13, 1937) was a Branch Chief at the U.S. Army Harry Diamond Laboratories who also served the U.S. Army Materiel Command as the Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Thrust Area Manager for Soldering Technology. Career He entered the US Army Harry Diamond Laboratories as a mechanical engineer student trainee in 1959 and retired in 2001. As a Senior level Branch Chief, he was an inventor named in 14 Patents and in 1982 was decorated by the Commanding Officer as Inventor of the Year for contributions that lowered the production cost of artillery fuzes. He also served as manager of multimillion-dollar programs, one example being the first production of the M734 Multi-Option Mortar Fuze for war reserves. In the field of manufacturing science, he managed the US Army ManTech Thrust Area for Soldering Technology, which was responsible for reducing the cost of Army electronic systems on a national scale by introducing new technologies into industrial base soldering lines.Melvyn J.

He coordinated the national ManTech mission with activities having common interests and willing to share results, namely Small Business Innovative Research soldering programs supported by the Air Force, Navy ManTech programs, Department of Defense study groups for Soldering Standard 2000, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, Tri-Service Quality Assurance personnel, University professors, and major defense contractors willing to serve as test beds in no-cost Cooperative Research and Development Agreements. For these accomplishments he received the US Army Harry Diamond Laboratories‚Äô John A. Ulrich Award for Managerial Leadership, 1989. He identified the gaps in scientific research that were inhibiting productivity on soldering lines by sponsoring Sandia National Laboratories to conduct symposia with 50 renowned scientists from academe, industry, and government and publish three textbooks to serve as roadmaps for future research: The Mechanics of Solder Alloy Interconnects,D.

Kinamn, Solder Mechanics, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Warrendale, Pennsylvania 1991. (Acknowledgement to George Lucey) He supplied copies of these textbooks to graduate level classes at nine universities and encouraged the writing of additional textbooks by the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) as a means of inserting other DOD Critical Technologies into the curricula of a new graduate degree in electronics manufacturing. His vision and in-kind help was instrumental in formulating a successful educational program at CALCE, funded by DARPA in 1994-97, leading to a comprehensive graduate engineering curriculum in electronic products and systems. Today, this program is internationally recognized as one of the premier world-class programs in this subject matter, offers over 12 graduate courses and has over 300 alumni at leading electronics manufacturers all over the world, shaping the future of the industry.U.

Nakayama, ‚ÄúElectronic Packaging and Reliability Education for the 21st Century: The University of Maryland CALCE EPRC Program‚Äú, 1997 Electronic Components and Technology Conference, pp 585‚Äì588. For this accomplishment, he shared with Dr. Abhijit Dasgupta of CALCE the US Army Research Laboratories Associated Achievement Award for Technology Transfer. To support hands-on laboratory studies, he also supplied inspection equipment for electronic manufacturing to the U.S. Navy Electronics Manufacturing Productivity Facility at the Naval Weapons Support Center, Crane, Indiana.Stephany Stiptzberg, \\"Producibility Microfactory Cuts System Costs\\", SCOPE, Harry Diamond Laboratories, Volume III, No. 2, September 1991, p.8 He noted the cost driver that was nationally pervasive on production lines was the inspection of assemblies after soldering and the subsequent reworking of joints with irregular shapes simply because there were no tools available to assess the risk to reliability after delivery. He decided variations in wetting and spreading were root causes of irregular shapes and invested in radically new research at the Rockwell International Science Center, the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, and the National Institutes of Science and Technology.

These cooperative efforts of nationally renowned scientists and engineers from government-industry-academia met the Army mission objective of developing new manufacturing technologies capable of reducing the procurement cost of electronic weapons systems currently in production. The program ended, however, when a joint Army ‚Äì Industry study in 1990 concluded the overall Army ManTech program investments focusing primarily on soldering were too low to incentivize contractors into quick implementation on a large national scale. The study recommendation, instead, was to redirect funding into research for new manufacturing concepts for weapons of the future.\\"Industrial Preparedness\\", Committee on Industrial Mobilization, Manufacturing Studies Board et.al., National Academy Press, Washington D.C., August 15, 1990, pp 24-26 The Army Materiel Command presented George Lucey the second highest award offered to civilians in 1990, the US Army Decoration for Meritorious Civilian Service.

Lucey Jr. (nicknamed Stormy) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on November 13, 1937 to Phyllis Claire Curott and George Kenneth Lucey. Soon after WWII (1947) the father became one of the first overseas navigators for Trans World Airlines and the family was moved to Rome, Italy. Stormy and his older sister attended elementary school at the Overseas School of Rome in the villa of the recently deceased dictator, Benito Mussolini. TWA relocated the family at the onset of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, to Heliopolis, near Cairo Egypt. The children attended the Heliopolis Sporting Club and the English School of Cairo (1948‚Äì51) until a British firefight with Egyptians in Isma√Ølia resulted in Black Saturday riots that burned hundreds of buildings in Cairo (26 January 1952) and the 23 July Revolution that deposed King Farouk. For safety, the family moved outside Cairo to Maadi, where the children attended the Cairo American School (1952‚Äì53) and the Maadi Sporting Club. Once a home was built in Colesville MD, the family returned to America in 1953, where both children graduated from Sherwood High School and the University of Maryland. The sister, Margo Lucey won the Miss District of Columbia beauty contest and later was the first runner-up to Miss America (1955). Footnotes Patents # George K.

It is located at the end of Hospital Street, on the north side, at the junction with Millstone Lane (at ). The existing building dates from the mid 18th century and is listed at grade II; English Heritage describes it as \\"good\\" in the listing. Nikolaus Pevsner describes it as \\"square and stately.\\"Pevsner, p. 288 It incorporates an earlier timber-framed house at the rear, which probably dates from the late 16th or early 17th century.

The front fa√ßade faces Millstone Lane and is set well back from the street behind a brick wall. This face has two projecting end wings, with decorative stone quoins at each corner. The main central doorway is flanked by paired Roman Doric columns and has a fanlight and curved pediment above. Two large three- light sash windows to the ground floor and three similar windows to the first floor all have wooden pilasters; the main doorway is also flanked by single- light windows. On the interior, the main staircase is described as \\"good\\" by English Heritage. The existing building incorporates an earlier timber-framed house at the rear, which probably originally had a central hall and flanking wings.Lake, p. 43Simpson, plate 24 Local historian Jeremy Lake has dated the roof timbers as late 16th or early 17th century. In 2015, after many years of neglect, The Rookery was acquired by local developer ISL who painstakingly restored the building in line with its Grade II status back to its former magnificent glory. The extensive works included: Underpinning to include a new 250mm waterproof structural floor, damp proofing up to 1.6m basement standard, a full roof renovation and strengthening with TLX gold multi-foil roofing insulation, roof valleys were replaced with code 6 lead, a complete new internal structural timber frame and Kingspan insulation. The building was completely repointed and missing bricks were replaced with new hand made Cheshire bricks, the sash windows were completely renovated with new mechanisms and new hand made casements and fitted with toughened glazing. As part of the renovation, The Rookery was converted into five luxury apartments. More information is available at www.therookerynantwich.net.

F. Bonaparte, C. L. Schultz, and M. B. Soares. 2010. Pterosauria from the Late Triassic of southern Brazil. In S. Bandyopadhyay (ed.), New Aspects of Mesozoic Biodiversity, Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences 132:63-71.  Description  The type species, Faxinalipterus minima was named and described in 2010 by Jos√© Fernando Bonaparte, Marina Bento Soares and C√©sar Leandro Schultz. The generic name is derived from Faxinal do Soturno and a Latinised Greek pteron, \\"wing\\". The specific name, from Latin minimus, means \\"smallest\\". Fossils of the species were found in 2002 and 2005 at a site 1.5 kilometres northeast of Faxinal do Soturno, Rio Grande do Sul, from the Caturrita Formation dating from the Carnian-Norian, 220‚Äì215 million years old. The holotype, UFRGS PV0927T, is part of the collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and consists of several, partially fragmentary, limb elements, perhaps of a single individual. These do not include bones from the hand. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been referred to the species. Faxinalipterus is a rather small animal, with an estimated total humerus length of eighteen millimetres. The size has been compared to that of a sparrow. The hind limbs, much better conserved than the front limbs, are relatively long. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is deep and lightly built with large openings. The maxillary teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and recurved.  Taxonomy  The describers have assigned Faxinalipterus to the Pterosauria, based on its long hollow limbs and saddle-shaped upper joint of the relatively short and robust humerus, suitable to perform a wing stroke. They see it as perhaps the oldest pterosaur known, as it possibly predates European finds from the Norian. That the possible age difference cannot be large, they see as an indication of rapid evolution in early pterosaurs. Because the Caturrita Formation consists of terrestrial sandstones, that evolution would have had its origins in a terrestrial, not coastal, habitat. They also concluded Faxinalipterus is the most basal known pterosaur, basal features including a lack of fusion between tibia and fibula, a thin radius and a coracoid that has not fused to the scapula. However, Alexander Kellner has suggested Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira. Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia (2013) stated that he was \\"unable to find any unequivocal pterosaur features\\" in the known fossils of F. minima; in fact, according to the author, \\"the purported humerus is quite unlike the humeri of the Triassic pterosaurs\\". Dalla Vecchia did not consider Faxinalipterus to be a pterosaur, but did not state what group of vertebrates it belonged to.

Early life June Shagaloff Alexander was born in 1928 in New York City. Her parents, Samuel Shagaloff and Gertrude Bellinson, emigrated to the United States from Russia in 1905. Their household was secular Jewish, and valued socialist ideals. Her father was a pharmacist who owned and managed a drugstore, first in Merrick and then in Baldwin, Long Island. As a child, she spent time at her father's store and, in the summer, at nearby Jones Beach. Some people believed she was African-American and, at an early age, she experienced racial discrimination. These experiences left a lasting impression, and contributed to her civil rights activism as an adult. In 1946, she enrolled at the University of Cincinnati and at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, and graduated from New York University in 1950 with a degree in Sociology with honors. Civil Rights Work In 1950, June Shagaloff joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, headed by Thurgood Marshall, who hired her at the end of an undergraduate internship. Marshall, who would later become a Justice of the United States Supreme Court, believed that the success of litigation depended on its impact on families and their willingness to demand desegregation and send their children to desegregated schools. Consequently, he hired Shagaloff, one of two staff members of the department who was not a lawyer, to conduct social research and organize communities around issues of school desegregation. As one of her first assignments, in 1952 Marshall sent her to Cairo, Illinois to help the NAACP branch end school segregation. While she was in Cairo, she was arrested for conspiring to \\"endanger the health and life of certain children.\\"Brown in Baltimore: School Desegregation and the Limits of Liberalism, by Howell S. Baum, Cornell University Press (2010). Marshall immediately flew to Cairo and, after many hours at the jailhouse, negotiated her release.Freedom's sword: the NAACP and the struggle against racism in America, 1909-1969, By Gilbert Jonas, Routledge (2005). On another assignment, she helped develop the social research which was critical in the Legal Defense Fund's victory in the Supreme Courts' 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which ended legal segregation in America. She aided psychologist Kenneth Clark in examining experiences of children in segregated schools and in the process of desegregating various institutions.Social Scientists for Social Justice: Making the Case Against Segregation, by John P. Jackson, NYU Press (2001). They found that children in segregated schools that offered similar material resources were nevertheless impacted negatively by the fact of segregation, including the development of lower esteem and motivation levels. This research led the Supreme Court to overcome the \\"Separate but Equal\\" doctrine that had been established in the 19th century by Plessy v. Ferguson. Clark and Shagaloff Alexander also found no evidence that gradual desegregation offered advantages over quick action, which led to the NAACP's position that desegregation must be implemented quickly to be effective. Also in preparation for arguments in the Brown case, she researched congressional hearings on the Fourtheenth Amendment to discern the extent to which drafters intended equality to include education, working with historian John Hope Franklin. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the NAACP, ending legal segregation, on May 17, 1954. After the Brown decision, she continued her work at the Legal Defense Fund on education issues and school desegregation. In 1961, she became the first Education Director of the national NAACP, then headed by Roy Wilkins. Her work organizing local communities together with local chapters of the NAACP, fighting for desegregation, and mobilizing parents brought her to many towns and cities across the United States. Shagaloff directed the new national NAACP school desegregation program in the North and West, in scores of communities from Boston to San Francisco.NAACP Legal Defense Fund: Conversation with Veteran Organizer June Shagaloff (2014).

In 1972, they moved to Israel, living in Ashkelon until 1983. Alexander helped found the Ashkelon chapter of Peace Now and taught English to elementary school students. In 1983, she moved with her family to Amityville, NY, where she was active with the local NAACP chapter and then, in 1984, to West Nyack, New York.

May 17, 2006 Background The 6 minute 12 second-long short machinima film Deviation, was written and directed by Jon Griggs of Hard Light Films. Using the virtual world of the online game Counter Strike, Griggs directed the virtual actors and recorded the footage using a DVX100. Deviation was entered as a candidate for shortlist and screening at the Tribeca Film Festival as part of the New York counterpart of Australia's Tropfest, Tropfest @ Tribeca programme, which celebrates the importance of short film in the filmmaking industry. Each entry had to include a signature theme; in 2006 this was the presence of a manhole cover. TropFest shorts line-up announced for Tribeca, FilmThreat.com. April 21, 2006 Deviation almost did not make it to the Tribeca Film Festival since, shortly before the film's premiere, the game manufacturer of Counter Strike, the Valve, refused to give permission for the film to be distributed for commercial use. Valve maintained that as intellectual property owners of Counter Strike, they had definitive rights over its distribution. Meet the Machinimakers: The 2006 Machinima Festival Report, Panel: \\"Intellectual Properties Roundtable\\", Gamasutra.com, 2006 In response, Griggs informed Valve of his intention to release a \\"protest video\\" version of Deviation in which all of Valve's intellectual property was removed, leaving just the actor's voices, music and story, and replacing the visuals with simple words and pictures depicting Grigg's struggle with Valve, and a call to viewers to support him. Valve eventually backed down and the all-clear was given for the motion picture to be released on 28 April 2006 at the Tribeca Film Festival Film Vault > Deviation, TribecaFilm.com, 2006 Deviation, IMDB.com, June 13, 2006, in front of a live audience of over 4,000 people.

VisionFest, Audience: Withoutabox, September 20, 2007 Tired of running through the same tunnels every day, ascending the same manhole and getting killed in battle each time, he tries to encourages his superior, ‚ÄúSgt‚Äù and the rest of his team (‚ÄúLizard‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrow‚Äù) to rationalise their monotonous behaviour. \\"Doesn‚Äôt it strike you as strange,\\" MacIntyre asks, \\"that we keep doing the same thing over and over and over?\\" MacIntyre raises questions about what the purpose of life as a virtual soldier is, why they have to follow orders and who exactly is it that gives them the orders that they dutifully follow to the death anyway? MacIntyre almost manages to successfully persuade his 'young' team mate Crow that there could be ‚Äúanother way‚Äù, but indecisive Crow is coerced by Sgt and Lizard, who are fully indoctrinated into the call of duty, into filing rank and following orders.

To this end, Deviation was only released in full form at the Tribeca Film Festival; before this, only a movie-style trailer was released and even after its premier, though made freely available, Deviation earns royalties and is subject to a licensing contract with independent film network, Atom Films. It has been suggested that in the script of Deviation, Griggs is asking a politically loaded question; ‚ÄúWho is leading whom?‚Äù, Propping up some successes, Machinima.org, June 21, 2006 which invokes thoughts of the political outcry surrounding George W.

The scenes were framed using a virtual camera then shot with a Panasonic DVX100 videoing the computer screen. The coverage was edited traditionally using Final Cut Pro then sound design, voice acting and score were added to complete the film. Awards and Festival Screenings By being the first machinima piece to be officially selected and premiered in competition at a major film festival (that being the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City in 2006), Deviation is credited with being the first machinima short film to be classed as a film in its own right by the film community.

Biography He graduated from Rutgers University in 1866 and received a degree from New Brunswick Theological Seminary in 1869, finally receiving his PhD from Rutgers in 1891. He was the pastor at the South Bushwick Reformed Church in Brooklyn, New York, starting soon after his ordination in 1869, and continuing until his death in 1900. Although this was his main focus, he also managed to make substantial contributions to science during those same years. He was an early member in the Brooklyn Entomological Society, and he was editor of its publication Entomologia Americana from 1887 to 1889. In 1888 he took on the new position of entomologist at the Rutgers' New Jersey Agricultural Experiment station, founding the department of entomology there and teaching entomology courses at the university. He resigned after only a year when it became apparent that it took too much time away from his primary responsibility as pastor, but left a good foundation for his successor, John Bernhardt Smith, to build upon. Most of his entomological collection was given to Rutgers well before his death, with the core specimens that he kept for reference going to the Brooklyn Museum after his death.

Officially established in 1978, it is a not-for-profit private institution, legally declared as an organization of federal public interest. It was created by the Brazilian collector and philanthropist Ema Gordon Klabin (1907‚Äì1994), with the purpose of preserving and displaying her art collection, as well as promoting cultural, artistic and scientific activities. The foundation is headquartered in Ema's former house in Jardins district, specially designed by architect Alfredo Ernesto Becker in the 1950s to hold her collection. The house is surrounded by a 4,000 square meters garden projected by Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx. The Foundation's collection includes more than 1,500 pieces, covering some of the most compelling periods of Western art history, from Greek and Etruscan civilizations to European masters, with important works from the Dutch, Flemish, Italian and French schools, as well as works from Asian cultures, African and pre-Columbian art. Brazilian art is also outlined in the collection, which includes examples ranging from colonial period to the first generations of modernists. The Foundation's library holds an assemblage of rare books, ranging from illuminated manuscripts to incunables. History =Ema Klabin= Ema Klabin (right) with her older sister, Eva, and her younger sister, Mina, in Switzerland (1915). Ema walking with her father in Italy (left). Ema in Berlin, in 1925. Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1907, Ema Gordon Klabin was the second daughter of the Lithuanian immigrants Fanny and Hessel Klabin. Her father was one of the founders of Klabin, a leading paper manufacturer company in Brazil. She spent a great part of her childhood in Europe, making frequent travels to her homeland. Taken by surprise by the World War I, the family, which had been living in Germany since 1913, was forced to move to Switzerland, where they stayed until 1919. During this period, Ema obtained her only formal education. After returning to Brazil, she only studied with private teachers, since at that time there were no conditions for women to study, except at the Catholic schools, which she could not attend due to her Jewish origin. She grew as a great appreciator of music and art, an avid reader, and frequenter of concerts, theater, opera and ballet. She soon developed great interest in collecting. Her first acquisitions were oriental rugs, porcelain and silverware. After Hessel Klabin's death in 1946, Ema and her sister, Eva, became heiresses of the family's fortune. Ema also became her father's successor at the company council. She never married nor had children, dedicating herself exclusively to business affairs, philanthropic and cultural activities. As her sister, Ema also continued to expand her art collection, making frequent travels to Europe and the United States to acquire new items. In 1948, she commissioned the architect Alfredo Ernesto Becker to project her a new house in a plot of land she inherited from her father, located in the Jardins district, in order to hold her growing collection. Some time later, she would order the construction of a winter country house in Campos do Jord√£o, when there was no space left to hold her frequent acquisitions. Ema became significantly involved in the cultural life of S√£o Paulo. She served as a member of the boards of trustees of the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art, the S√£o Paulo Museum of Modern Art and the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. She collaborated at the creation of the Lasar Segall Museum and the Magda Tagliaferro Foundation, and was also a member and supporter of the Sociedade de Cultura Art√≠stica and of the S√£o Paulo Philarmonic Orchestra. Among her philanthropic activities, her most significant work was the donation of the amount necessary to buy the lot where the Albert Einstein Hospital would be built, as well as organizing fund-raising activities to help finance its construction. She also collaborated with the Association of Parents and Friends of the Handicapped of S√£o Paulo (APAE), the Association for Assistance to Children with Birth Defects (AACD) and the Cancer Hospital. In the 1970s, childless, Ema began to concern herself about the future of her collection. One of her first ideas was to donate major part of it to Brazilian museums. But after the tragic fire which destroyed almost the entire collection of the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art in 1978, she decided, as her sister, to create a foundation with the purpose of keeping the collection together and turning her house into a museum open to public visitation after her death. Ema died in 1994, aged 86. =The Foundation= The Foundation was officially registered in 1978. After Ema's death, her house remained closed for three years, until the end of 1996, when the architect Paulo de Freitas Costa was invited to set up a team to begin the activities and was later named curator of the institution. The work of researching and cataloging the collection began in 1997, conducted through consultations with specialists and institutions within Brazil and abroad, aiming to solve questions related to identification, attribution and authenticity of the pieces, beside determining their artistic and historic value. Restoration actions were also carried out in many pieces through agreements or collaboration of other institutions. The definition that best applies to the Ema Klabin Foundation is that of a \\"house-museum\\", where a \\"closed collection\\" is permanently arranged according to the taste and wish of its creator, thus preserving the original character, idiosyncrasy and personality of the collector. In recent years, the Ema Klabin Foundation has been making efforts at disseminating information about the collection, including by lending pieces for temporary exhibitions held in museums of S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre. Pieces of the collection have also been shown in foreign exhibitions, such as Brazil through European Eyes, held in London, Br√©sil Baroque, held at the Petit Palais in Paris, Chaim Soutine, held in the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de C√©ret and the Jewish Museum Vienna, and the retrospective exhibition Lasar Segall: un expressionista brasile√±o held at Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City and the Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires. =The house= The headquarters of the Ema Klabin Foundation is located in a 4,000 square meters lot at Jardim Europa district, an upscale subdivision designed by Hip√≥lito Pujol J√∫nior at the end of the 1920s, following the model of the British-style garden-cities in the adjoining district of Jardim Am√©rica, projected by the English urban planner Richard Barry Parker in the previous decade. The house has a floor space of 900 square meters and was projected in the late 1940s by architect Alfredo Ernesto Becker. Its gardens were designed by Roberto Burle Marx. The house presents an eclectic style, blending modern and classic elements. It seems to be inspired by European palace pavilions, particularly by the Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam, visited by Ema in her childhood and teenage years. It is a single floor building organized in a long semicircular gallery, facing the garden, around which all the rooms are distributed. Although it presents an impressive scale, as seen by the nearly five-meter-high ceilings, it possesses relatively few rooms. Collection =African art= The collection of African art comprises religious and ritual objects, executed in wood, ivory and bronze by distinct Ethnic groups of Western Africa, such as Ashanti, Bambara, Yoruba, Mossi, Dan, Baoul√©, Bakongo and Bakuba, most of which dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It comprises rugs, sculptures, paintings, prints, furniture and decorative and ritual items. Among these, Chinese artworks stand out, both in quality and quantity. The collection includes an important assemblage of ritual bronzes dating back to Shang (14th to 9th century BC) and Zhou dynasties (10th to 3rd century BC), ceramic funerary figures produced during the Tang Dynasty (8th century) and polychromed wood sculptures of the Ming Dynasty (14th to 17th century). =Brazilian art= The Colonial Brazilian art is represented by a group of 24 Baroque sacred images, as well as by a number of polychromed wood carvings (columns, doorways, finials etc.).

From modernist Brazilian artists, the collection includes important paintings by Lasar Segall, Candido Portinari, Emiliano Di Cavalcanti and Tarsila do Amaral, as well as sculptures by Victor Brecheret, Bruno Giorgi and Bella Prado. There are also drawings and prints by Cl√≥vis Graciano, Iber√™ Camargo, Maria Bonomi, Marcelo Grassmann, Poty Lazzarotto, etc. =Classical antiquity= The collection of antiquities at the Ema Klabin Foundation consists of works in ceramic, terracotta, bronze and marble from Greek, Etruscan and Roman civilizations, most of which produced between the 4th century BC and the 1st century AD. It comprises sculptures, aryballos, amphorae, Tanagra figurines, etc. Outstanding among the sculptures is a Greek marble head of Zeus (5th century BC). =Decorative and applied arts= The collection of decorative and applied arts includes a relatively large number of pieces, such as light fixtures, rugs, small statuettes, fireplace pediments, mirrors and decorative objects in general. There is a large collection of tableware, including porcelain (S√®vres, Limoges, Meissen) and crystal glassware (Baccarat, Bohemia). The furniture collection is mainly composed by Italian and French pieces, ranging from 16th to 19th century, including tables, cabinets and other items. The most important works in the collection, however, are those of Portuguese-Brazilian origin, produced with Jacaranda, being the most noticeable example a Portuguese games table desk with several ivory marquetry covers, commissioned by the Portuguese royalty. The collection also includes many examples of upholstery produced by Terry Della Stuffa, as well as Chinese tables and cabinets, etc. The museum also holds an expressive silverware collection, composed by over 150 pieces. Outstanding among these are the assemblage of antique ceremonial chalices, proceeding from England, Germany and Russia, the collection of 19th-century Portuguese toothpick holders, the collection of English and Portuguese candlesticks, incense boats and chandeliers and the Brazilian religious silverware, which includes candlesticks, processional lanterns, etc. The collection of silver tableware is mainly composed by British pieces, executed by important silversmith sculptors, such as Paul de Lamerie, Paul Storr and John Wakelin. Pompeo Batoni. Portrait of a Lady as Diana the Huntress (1760s). =European art= The collection includes a number of Italian paintings dating from 16th to 18th century. Outstanding among them are the religious and mythological scenes by Raffaellino del Garbo, Giacomo Francia, Giovanni Battista Gaulli and Sebastiano Ricci, besides the portraits by Alessandro Allori and Pompeo Batoni. The collection presents a wide panorama of Flemish and Dutch schools, ranging from 15th to 17th century, with a strong emphasis in Baroque paintings. It includes genre works, hunting scenes, landscapes, portraits and still lifes by artists as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Jan van Goyen, David Teniers the Younger, Gerard ter Borch, Abraham Brueghel, Philips Wouwerman and Abraham Hondius, beside two small panels attributed to Dirk Bouts. The collection also includes two landscape paintings by Frans Post, including View of Olinda, probably the most valuable canvas in the museum. Outstanding among the French paintings is the canvas Ariadne by Jean-Baptiste Greuze. There are also landscapes and mythological scenes by Claude Lorrain, Gabriel Briard, Nicolas- Antoine Taunay, a Still-life by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and works by the painters of the School of Paris, like Chaim Soutine and Maurice de Vlaminck, beside two important canvases by Marc Chagall: √Ä la campagne and Couple with flowers and a rooster. The European collection also include prints by Albrecht D√ºrer, Rembrandt, Francisco de Goya, Pablo Picasso, among others, as well as a number of Eastern icons. =Pre-Columbian art= This small collection is composed by objects produced prior to the 16th century, proceeding from relevant archaeological sites in present-day Bolivia, Peru and Mexico, such as Tiwanaku, Chancay and Nazca. It comprises works in terracotta, stone, wood and fabric produced by civilizations like Chav√≠n, Moche, Chim√∫, Toltec, and Nazca. Library The Ema Klabin Foundation Library holds a collection of more than 3,000 books. Though small in size, it includes an important set of rare works, such as illuminated manuscripts, incunabula and Aldine editions. It also holds a collection of reports of European travelers in Brazil, ranging from 16th to 19th century, including works by Andr√© Th√©vet, Arnoldus Montanus, Robert Southey, Willem Blaeu, Maria Graham, von Spix, von Martius, etc. Another highlight of the collection is the set of luxury books published by the Society of the One Hundred Bibliophiles of Brazil, illustrated by some of the most important Brazilian modernist artists.

It is a member of the Old Scholars Football Association. Club History Founded The club was founded as an old scholars team from the Dominic College in Glenorchy, Tasmania in 1976 where it commenced fielding a side in the Thirds competition before fielding a full senior side in 1978. DOSA, nicknamed the Roosters, were a member of the Tasmanian Amateur Football League (Southern Amateurs) from 1976-1980. When the TAFL Old Scholars Division was formed in the Southern Amateurs in 1981 they continued on in that division until 1986 collecting premiership victories in 1984 and 1986. In 1987 the Old Scholars clubs formed a breakaway competition known as the Old Scholars Football Association in which DOSA continues to participate in to this day. They have six senior premierships in their thirty-two seasons of participation in the OSFA, taking home the 1987, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2013 and 2018 premierships, they have also participated in numerous losing grand finals over that duration. Home Grounds DOSA have had four home grounds during their years of existence. They played their home matches at the Dominic College Football Ground in Tolosa Street, Glenorchy from 1976-2005 until they were forced to move from the venue. In 2006 the club began playing their matches at Cadbury's Oval (St Anne's Cricket Club Ground) in Claremont but after finding the venue to be unsuitable, they left the ground at the end of the 2009 season and began playing their home matches at North Hobart Oval where they were to set up their clubrooms and administration base in the Doug Plaister Stand. At the end of the 2013 season DOSA was once again forced to move after AFL Tasmania decided to base the new TSL entity (Hobart City Demons) in the Plaister Stand and to give North Hobart's playing surface a rest during the wetter months and this forced the club to groundshare the TCA Ground with Hobart Football Club from 2014 onwards. = TAFL Old Scholars Division (1981-1986) = Premiers ‚óè 1984, 1986 = Old Scholars Football Association (1987-) = Premiers ‚óè 1987, 1989, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2013, 2018.

Biography The daughter of an Ivorian father and a mother from Martinique, Christina Goh was born in 1977 in Paris, France. She spent her life in C√¥te d'Ivoire and went to university in France but finally chose a musical career at the age of 23. Her first album was recorded in 2003, however, it is only in 2009, that the single \\"R√©putation de peine\\" (Reputation of sorrow), released and sold in Martinique, was played on french-speaking radios of Japan, Greece, Andorra, Brazil and Quebec. Christina Goh, named \\"La perle noire de l'afro-blues\\" (afro-blues black pearl), puts together African, caribbean and blues styles, but she remains at the same time faithful to french song texts. In 2008, she created the Christina Goh Concept, which is an atypical Trio : djembe, guitar, voice or piano, guitar, voice. The djembe is always the rhythmic point of the presentation. Its fusion with the electric guitar, whose blues accents translate the poetic characteristic of the concept, is atypical. In 2010, the musical album Christina Goh Concept was recorded in French West Indies and sold by the label ICE Consulting in Martinique. The ten-titled album on Plaza Mayor Company Ltd label made the world discover the concept on the web. Christina Goh wrote two collections of poems.

The BC-CCM is a community of artists and researchers that began in the 1970s. The mission of the BC-CCM is to explore the creative possibilities of technology in relation to the creation of music, sound art, sound design, and multimedia arts. Courses cover techniques of music composition with digital tools and instruments, theories and implementation of sound processing and sound synthesis, design and creation of new digital music and multimedia performance instruments, audio production, history and aesthetics of experimental music and sound art, and creative collaboration. The BC-CCM also sponsors residencies of visiting composers and media creators.  History  The Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music began when composer Robert Starer, then a member of the faculty of the Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College, proposed the idea of creating an electronic music studio at Brooklyn College in the mid-1970s. The idea took root, and Jacob Druckman and Noah Creshevsky were the studio‚Äôs first Co-Directors. In those early days the equipment consisted largely of Moog analog synthesizers. Charles Dodge took over as Director in 1978, and he was responsible for having the studios designated as a center within Brooklyn College, the Center for Computer Music (CCM). Charles Dodge was a pivotal figure in the history of the center. Dodge, originally from Iowa, had done a bachelor's degree at the University of Iowa and then earned his MA and doctorate (DMA) in Music Composition at Columbia University. While at Columbia, Dodge was very active at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. In particular, Dodge was one of the leading innovators in the emerging field of computer music composition (as opposed to analog electronic composition, the norm in the field through the 1970s). Dodge created some of the first meritorious works in the field of computer music, including Earth‚Äôs Magnetic Field (1970), which mapped magnetic field data to musical sounds, Speech Songs, a 1974 work that used analysis and resynthesis of human voices, and Any Resemblance is Purely Coincidental (1980), which combines live piano performance with a digitally-manipulated recording of Enrico Caruso singing the aria \\"Vesti la giubba\\". During Dodge‚Äôs years as Professor of Composition and Director of the Brooklyn College Center for Computer Music (BC-CCM), Dodge had the CCM designated as a center within Brooklyn College in 1978, and brought it to a world-class standing in the field of computer music. Dodge secured an initial donation of equipment from Bell Laboratories, and then proceeded to acquire large grants to fund BC-CCM work. The facilities received funding through grants from the United States Office of Education, the National Endowment for the Arts, the City University of New York Faculty Research and Award Program, and the Rockefeller Foundation, and through donations from private individuals. Under Dodge‚Äôs leadership and with the efforts of numerous students, guests and artistic partners, the BC-CCM came to national prominence. At that time the USA was leading the world in the field of computer music, and so this made the BC-CCM one of the world‚Äôs most highly regarded centers. During these years, the BC-CCM presented summer workshops, which were attended by musicians from around the world, and hosted residencies for many composers of national and international stature, including John Cage, Lejaren Hiller, Laurie Spiegel, and Judy Klein, Larry Austin, the Fylkingen Group from Stockholm, EMS Sweden, Robert Dick, Bob Ostertag, Morton Subotnick, Pauline Oliveros, Jon Appleton, Noah Creshevsky, James C. Mobberley, Jean Claude Risset, Lars Gunnar Bodin, Sten Hanson, and directors of IMEB Fran√ßoise Barriere and Christian Clozier. This helped attract outstanding students, some of whom are now leaders in the field today, including Curtis Bahn (faculty, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), Matthew Suttor (faculty, Yale), Jason Stanyek (faculty, NYU), and Madelyne Byrne (faculty, Palomar College). In the early 1990s after Charles Dodge stepped down as Director of the BC-CCM Noah Creshevsky assumed the directorship, with George Brunner as Technical Director. It was at this time that the CCM began to host an International Electro-Acoustic Music Festival and concert series, offering performances of music, video, film, and live electronic works by artists from around the world. When Noah Creshevsky retired in 2000, George Brunner took over as Acting Director until Amnon Wolman was named Director in 2003. Douglas Cohen generously served as Acting Director while Wolman was on an extended leave, and Douglas Geers joined the faculty as Director of the BC-CCM in fall of 2009. Current faculty include composer Douglas Geers, Director; composer- producer George Brunner, Director of Music Technology; composer Doug Cohen, Associate Director; guitarist/composer David Grubbs; media artist John J.A. Jannone; audio producer Miguel Macias; and computer scientist Elizabeth Sklar.  Faculty  *George Brunner *Douglas Cohen *Douglas Geers *David Grubbs *John J.A.

Local legend was that the concrete objects had been barrels of concrete on a ship or barge that had wrecked on the reef during the Civil War, but an analysis performed in 2008 showed that the concrete was a type of Portland cement produced between 1890 and 1923. Archaeologists have found evidence of an iron- or steel-hulled vessel with two masts that wrecked on the reef, but have not identified the ship.

It opened in the mid 19th century providing farm and housewares for local consumption, later the business diversified into craft pottery. The property is Grade II listed. History The pottery developed on a site belonging to the Brougham estate. Its beginnings can be traced to 1855 when local clay from Clifton Dykes was used for the production of bricks, tiles and pipes. Production of pottery began in 1860 when John Schofield and Margaret Thorburn moved to the site from Stepney Bank Pottery in Newcastle. John Schofield died in 1917, and Margaret Thorburn in 1937. The pottery remained in the Schofield and Thorburn family's hands until 1973. It was given Ancient Monument status in 1973. The pottery in 1983, prior to renovation The enterprise was provided with fuel (coal) via a siding from the Eden Valley railway line, when the railway closed in 1962 the pottery kiln fell out of use. The beehive kiln remains, as does a blunger for preparing suitable clay. The steam engine used to drive the pottery machinery was restored in the 1990s by Fred Dibnah. Facilities built for visitors including a museum. Pottery making was revived at Wetheriggs, as the only remaining steam-powered pottery in the country. Mary Chappelhow became the master potter at Wetheriggs in 2003. Production has since ceased at the site, and Chappelhow moved her studio to Brougham Hall. From 2006 to 2014 Wetheriggs Zoo and Animal Sanctuary operated on the site until it moved to another location.

It is written and illustrated by Chandra Free. Plot summary After the death of his girlfriend, Sith, Guy Salvatore can no longer make sense of his own world. He has hallucinations of monsters that besiege him with requests and threaten his life wherever he goes. He is completely unsure if these manifestations are real or are born in his mind. As the line between reality and insanity is blurred Guy comes across a man who calls himself Satan and claims holds the answers to all of Guy‚Äôs worries. Satan restores Guy's hope promising Sith is still alive, but the two Gods that oversee existence let her be ripped from her world by unknown forces. She is now drifting through dimensional planes known as ‚ÄúDream Worlds.‚Äù Satan pleads Guy to use his power to leave his world‚Äôs plane, search for Sith, and seek retribution from the Gods that caused the ordeal. The chapter takes place in the present day in the town of Salem. Things start off with our main character, Guy, waking up and going to school after seeing a massive \\"hallucination\\" come out of his bathroom mirror and ask for floss. At school he is only reminded of the loss of his girlfriend and leaves. After a night of more strange creatures, he struggles to sleep and finally does so only to meet with a woman calling herself \\"sickness\\" in his dream. She turns into a hideous creature, kissing Guy and holding him in her clutches. Guy wakes up started and upset. We are then taken to the entrance of Heaven, the domain of the character Good God. Her character comes in hoping to get back into her office in, but has lost her key to the door to Heaven. She calls for the aid of her friend and fellow god Evil God, second in command to Good God and ruler of hell. Together they go look for the key in the last place she was, a graveyard in Guys town. At the same time this is happening, Guy has gone to the graveyard and is mourning the loss of his girlfriend. When the gods show up, he is able to see them, which shouldn't be possible for normal human beings. Upon seeing Good God, Guy locks eyes with her, but the gods disappear. Guy grows more frustrated with the series of events taking place around him, and as he expresses his anger, a man claiming to be Satan appears suddenly. He claims Guy's girlfriend is alive and that he can still find her in another dimension. Initially Guy shrugs the man off as one of his hallucinations, but as his hallucinations become more vivid and physically threatening, he begins to question our perception of reality and his own sanity. The second chapter opens in an area called \\"The Door Nexus\\" which is described as being between you, the devil and the deep blue sea\\". Good God and Evil God come through a door, Evil God yelling about the fact that Guy saw them. Good God says they can simply look Guy up, and go into the Limbo dimension. There they run into Limbo God, third in command and keeper of Limbo, who goes with them to go eat before looking up Guy. Meanwhile Guy is in math class, where Mortia, the girlfriend of Andrew who is Guy's best friend, is hitting on Guy. He yells at her drawing the attention of the teacher, but begins to see horrific things in class while his teacher is talking to him. His teacher is able to snap him out of this situation by yelling at him to go to the principal's office. In the realm of Heaven, the gods are investigating Guy Salvatore and why such strange events keep taking place around him. They find nothing abnormal about him, but his ability to see the gods says otherwise, leaving the gods feeling apprehensive about Guy.

It lies to the southeast of Upper Matecumbe Key. This reef lies within a Sanctuary Preservation Area (SPA).  Name  Alligator Reef is named for the USS Alligator, a ship assigned to suppress the trade of slaves coming from the African coast in the 1820s. In November 1822, the Alligator was escorting a convoy of merchant ships when it ran aground on the shallow reef. Despite efforts to save the damaged ship, the United States sank the USS Alligator to prevent pirates from pillaging the remains of the boat. The Alligator Reef Light sits on Alligator Reef. The wreck of the USS Alligator is located 200 feet southwest of the lighthouse and can be seen by snorkelers and divers year-round.  Protection  The protected reef is located four nautical miles offshore and is trademarked by the black and white lighthouse present within the reef. Four yellow buoys designate the perimeter of the reef; as anchoring in the SPA is forbidden, there are several buoys in the SPA for mooring boats. Anchoring on the reef is not allowed unless the anchor is fixed to the sandy bottom, as an anchor placed on the reef itself can damage and kill the coral. Tourists venture to the reef daily to relax in the serenity the reef provides. With a variety of aquatic species present, this reef is ideal for beginning snorkelers and divers; some parts of the reef lie at a depth of only eight feet. Many local dive and snorkel boats venture to the reef to provide guided instruction for beginners. The status of a protected reef restricts any removal of aquatic life. Fishing of any kind is not permitted within the reef and the removal of any coral, sand, shells, or any form of life is prohibited.

Built about 1796, it is one of the oldest mill buildings in the state, and a rare surviving example of brace-frame construction. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Sylvanus Selleck Gristmill is located in a rural setting of northern Greenwich, on the south side of Old Mill Road. It is set near the road, on a lot that slopes down to Converse Pond Brook. A now-breached stone dam spans the brook upstream of the mill building, which is a modestly sized wood frame structure covered by a gabled roof and wooden clapboards. A shed-roof ell extends on the downhill (south) side of the building, which is set on a fieldstone foundation that is fully exposed on the downhill side. The building was framed with beams of oak and chestnut, with bracing added to support the heavy milling equipment. A stone tailrace extends west from the building, giving way to an unlined former channel which leads back to the streambed. The mill was built by Sylvanus Selleck in about 1796, and is one of only two known 18th-century mill buildings in the state. Selleck was a farmer who apparently sought to supplement his farm income by providing milling services to other nearby farmers. An addition in about 1850 is believed to be by Edwin Knapp. The mill is a rare surviving example of braced-frame construction, which was once common. The mill was operated until Edwin Knapp's death in 1895. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Greenwich, Connecticut References Category:Grinding mills on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1796 Category:Buildings and structures in Greenwich, Connecticut Category:Grinding mills in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:1796 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Sylvanus Selleck Gristmill"},{"id":"28208026","text":"Sand Key is a coral reef located within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

It represented a rightist tendency amongst the proletarian parties in the country at the time. The party had a nationalist orientation. Split from the Labour-Farmer Party The party emerged from a split in the Labour-Farmer Party in 1926. An older generation of leaders of the Japan Peasant Union, such as Okabe Kansuke and Hirano Rikizo, were uncomfortable with the influence of the younger, radical generation in the Japan Peasant Union (who were keen on including leftwing elements in the Labour-Farmer Party), such as Oyama Ikuo. Okabe and Hirano's group broke away from the Labour-Farmer Party in March 1926 and on October 17, 1926 they founded the Japan Farmers Party.Scalapino, Robert A..

Works His most universally recognized contribution to Iranian culture lies in the field of literature. In poetry he has been considered one of the two or three greatest masters of the robƒÅ øƒ´(quatrains), while in philosophical prose only Suhrawardi stands on the same level. Similar to Avicenna (in his work Daneshnameyeh 'Alai), Baba Afzal employs a great deal of Persian vocabulary where others would have used Arabic, but unlike Avicenna he chooses only attractive and mellifluous terms. His works from the viewpoint of literary tradition is a delight to read nor does he neglect to employ the corresponding Arabic terms where clarity demands them. His influence on later thinkers has not been investigated however his works which are clearly and beautifully written were probably a source of inspirtation for philosophical writings in both Arabic and Persian. For his part, he follows the philosophical and logical terminology of Avicenna while most his works evoke a visionary aura in spite of their philosophical and logical exactitude. Besides his poetry, 54 works of prose in varying length have survived. =Poetry= Bowl of Reflections, early 13th century. Brooklyn Museum Around 500 quatrains are ascribed to him. Some of the themes include warnings about the futility of involvement with the things of the corporeal world, the correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm, and self-knowledge as the goal of human existence. Some of his quatrains are also recorded in the book Nozhat al-Majales. He is considered by some to be the greatest poet among the outstanding philosophers of Islam.Seyyed Hossein Nasr(1984), \\"Afdal al-Din Kashani and the Philosophical World of Khwaja Nasir al-Din Tusi\\", in Michael E. Marmura, \\"Islamic Theology and Philosophy: Studies in Honor of George F. Hourani\\", State University of New York: Albany Press\\" The themes of these quatrains include warnings about the futility of involvement with the things of the corporeal world, the correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm, and autology (self-knowledge) as the goal of human existence. = øAr≈º-nƒÅma = This is considered his magnum opus. It is the longest and most complete exposition of his philosophy that brings together all topics related to the perfection of the soul. It is divided into four ‚Äúdisplays‚Äù ( øar≈º) arranged in an ascending order according to the four kinds of things in the universe: corporeal bodies (ajsƒÅm), which are acted upon (kardahƒÅ); agents or souls, which do the acting (konandahƒÅ); concepts or known things (dƒÅnestahƒÅ); and knowers (dƒÅnandagƒÅn). =Javedan-nama= This comprehensive work is his most specifically Islamic treatment of his favorite themes; it is the only work of certain ascription to him outside the letters that quotes and comments on Quran and Hadith(Prophetic Sayings). =Other works= * Madarej al-Kamal () * RahanjƒÅm-nƒÅma - () In three discourses this work explains self-knowledge as the road to human perfection. * ResƒÅla dar  øelm o no·π≠q () * SƒÅz o pƒ´rƒÅya-ye ≈°ƒÅhƒÅn-e pormƒÅya () * MabƒÅdƒ´-e mawj≈´dƒÅt-e nafsƒÅnƒ´ * ƒÄyƒÅt al-·π£a·πá øa fi‚Äôl-ka≈°f  øan ma·π≠ƒÅleb elƒÅhƒ´ya sab øa - Brief discussion in Arabic of the intellect, soul and the body. Philosophy He wrote during a period when several figures were bridging the gaps between philosophy and sufism. His major concern is to explain the salvific power of true knowledge, i.e., self-knowledge, or knowledge of the Self (·∏èƒÅt or howwƒ´yat, God Himself viewed as the center of man‚Äôs being). His philosophy is an autology ()(Persian: ·∏µhod-≈°enƒÅsƒ´). That is: \\"To know oneself is to know the everlasting reality that is consciousness, and to know it is to be it.\\". His ontology is interconnected simultaneously with his epistemology, because according to him, full actualization of the potentialities of the universe can only take place through the self-awareness of human beings. This ontology can only be realized by the training of the human soul, or education in the widest sense of the term. His view of the structure of the reality is succinctly explained in the beginning of his work RahanjƒÅm-nƒÅma. Sample Poetry A quatrain: Suppose you run the world as you like, then what?

She was the younger sister of the former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. Biography Sabina Mugabe was born on 14 October 1934 at the Kutama Roman Catholic Mission, which was run by Jesuits of the Rome-based Marist Order, in the Zvimba District 50 miles northwest of Harare, to a Malawian-born father, Gabriel Matibili and a Shona mother, Bona. Sabina Mugabe left Rhodesia under an assumed name in 1975 and studied home economics and nutrition at Battersea College of Technology and Richmond College in London before going to Nova Scotia, Canada, to study for a diploma in social development at a Catholic college. Prior to leaving Rhodesia she had been sheltered by the Silveira House Catholic seminary, on the outskirts of Harare, while her brother Robert was leading ZANU guerrillas fighting former Rhodesian leader Ian Smith's forces from bases in Mozambique. She served as the Zanu-PF Member of Parliament (MP) for Makonde East from 1985 to 1990 and for Zvimba South from 1990 to 2008. She was implicated in the violent confiscation of farms owned by white Zimbabweans in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This included a link to the murder of a white Zimbabwean farmer by a mob she unleashed when she wanted his house for herself. Terry Ford, 55, was beaten and then shot in the head on his farm to the west of Harare. Earlier, in November 2000 Sabina Mugabe had informed Mr Ford that she wanted his farmstead \\"so she could move in\\". That Mr Ford's old Jack Russell, Squeak, refused to leave his body added a poignancy to the story that saw the case make international headlines. Sabina Mugabe suffered a stroke in 2007 and retired as an MP in 2008. According to then President Mugabe, he visited her prior to her death and was told that one-third of her brain had been damaged by the stroke. Sabina Mugabe died in Harare on 29 July 2010, aged 75, following a long illness. She was survived by her brother Robert and sister Bridgette, her four sons Leo Mugabe, Kevin Mugabe, Patrick and Robert Zhuwao and several grandchildren including Jason Zhuwao.
