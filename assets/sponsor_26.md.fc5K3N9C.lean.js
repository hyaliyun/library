Amator of Auxerre Amator studied theology under Saint Valerian, Bishop of Auxerre, but married a holy woman of Langres, venerated locally as Saint Martha, in order to please his parents. After their wedding, they mutually agreed to live together as brother and sister. By mutual consent, Martha subsequently became a nun and Amator received the clerical tonsure.Butler, Alban. “Saint Amator, Bishop of Auxerre, Confessor”. Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints, 1866. CatholicSaints.Info. 4 May 2013 He later succeeded Eladius as Bishop of Auxerre in 388 and governed the see until his death 30 years later. During this 30-year episcopacy, he built two churches and converted the remaining pagans in his diocese. He introduced the relics of Saint Cyricus into France, thus propagating this saint's cult. Germanus was one of the six dukes, entrusted by the emperor with the government of the Gallic provinces. He resided at Auxerre. At length he incurred the displeasure of Bishop Amator by hanging hunting trophies on a certain tree, which in earlier times had been the scene of pagan worship. Amator remonstrated with him in vain. One day when the duke was absent, the bishop had the tree cut down and the trophies burnt. Fearing the anger of the duke, who wished to kill him, he fled and appealed to the prefect Julius for permission to confer the tonsure on Germain. This being granted, Amator, who felt that his own life was drawing to a close, returned. When the duke came to the church, Amator caused the doors to be barred and gave him the tonsure against his will, telling him to live as one destined to be his successor, and forthwith made him a deacon. When in a short time Amator died, Germain was unanimously chosen to succeed him as bishop. MacErlean, Andrew. \\"St. Germain.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 26 Jan. 2013 Germanus subsequently wrote a biography of Amator. In the Middle Ages, a certain Stephen also composed a life of Amator, but it is considered a work of fiction. J. B. Bury suggests that Amator ordained Saint Patrick to the diaconate at Auxerre; and that Patrick was later ordained priest by Amator's successor Germanus of Auxerre in a church in Auxerre dedicated to Amator.Bury, J.B., \\"Sources of the Early Patrician Documents\\", The English Historical Review, (Mandell Creighton et al, eds.), Longman., July 1904, p. 499 Amator died in 418 and was buried in the church which he had built in honour of the Martyr Saint Symphorian, and which later bore his own name.Monks of Ramsgate. “Amator”. Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 30 May 2012 =Iconography= He is depicted as a bishop with an axe and tree. Amator is sometimes confused with a hermit of legend whose feast day is 20 August. A tradition in Autun also designates him as its first bishop, with an occupancy date of 250, tying him to the seven bishops sent to evangelise Gaul in the time of Decius. Amator and Rocamadour The sanctuary of Rocamadour The commune of Rocamadour is said to have been named after Saint Amator, who is believed to have been the founder of the ancient sanctuary. The crypt Saint-Amadour is situated here. The church of Notre Dame (1479) contains a wooden Black Madonna reputed to have been carved by Amator. Amadour was identified with the Biblical Zacheus, the tax collector of Jericho mentioned in Luke 19:1-10. He is also thought to have been a servant in the house of the Holy Family, who married St. Veronica, who wiped Jesus' face on the way to Calvary. Driven out of Palestine by persecution, Amadour and Veronica embarked in a frail skiff and, guided by an angel, landed on the coast of Aquitaine, where they met Bishop St. Martial, who was preaching the Gospel in the south-west of Gaul. After journeying to Rome, where he witnessed the martyrdoms of St. Peter and St. Paul, Amadour, having returned to France, on the death of his spouse, withdrew to a wild spot in Quercy where he built a chapel in honour of the Blessed Virgin, near which he died a little later.Clugnet, Léon. \\"Rocamadour.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 27 Apr. 2013 Amator's Acts cannot be dated as being older than the 12th century. It is now well established that St. Martial, Amadour's contemporary in the legend, lived in the 3rd not the 1st century, and Rome has never included him among the members of the Apostolic College. The untrustworthiness of the legend has led some recent authors to suggest that Amadour was an unknown hermit or the actual bishop of Auxerre of the same name. The Portuguese Amator Confusion is added by the fact that there is also a St. Amator () whose feast day is celebrated on 27 March. He was a hermit of Portugal, and several churches in the diocese of Guarda and elsewhere in Portugal are dedicated to him. A \\"San Amador\\" is the patron saint of the Spanish town of Martos.

It was published by the British Film Institute in 2001. Theory versus Post-Theory In the book's introduction, \\"The Strange Case of the Missing Lacanians\\", Žižek explicitly positions himself in opposition to the rational and empirical approach to studying cinema which is argued for by David Bordwell and Noël Carroll in their anthology Post-Theory. At the heart of The Fright of Real Tears is the debate between linear reasoned film theorising based on evidence, endorsed by Bordwell and Carroll, and free-associative film interpretation (sometimes referred to simply as \\"Theory\\") that references doctrines from psychoanalysis and Marxism endorsed by Žižek. The \\"missing Lacanians\\" referred to in the introduction's title are the (according to Žižek, non-existent) Lacanian film theorists Bordwell criticizes for introducing the concept of \\"the gaze\\" into film studies. Žižek argues that Bordwell has misunderstood the Lacanian concept of the gaze - a misunderstanding he partly blames on a lamentable (in Žižek's eyes) appropriation of Lacan by cultural studies. Žižek notes that Lacan's concept of the gaze is easily misunderstood as belonging to the subject, whereas Lacan actually believed that the gaze was on the side of the object (TFRT, p. 34). Žižek contentiously characterizes Post-Theory as a movement in film studies, which Bordwell denies, and argues that it demonstrates intellectual immodesty. Although he notes that those he calls \\"Post-Theorists\\" insist on the importance of empirical research in their work, Žižek believes that such a position implicitly exempts the investigating \\"Post-Theorist\\" from consideration. For Žižek, this is an illegitimate short- circuit. Citing Bordwell's work on the idea of a trans-cultural universal which directs and guides the spectator's attention, Žižek writes that \\"the very notion of a trans-cultural universal means different things in different cultures\\" (p. 17). Žižek's statement is not self-defeating and does not itself imply the existence of trans-cultural universals, he argues, because all cultures do not share the same notion of \\"universality\\". Bordwell has responded in detail to criticisms regarding trans-cultural universals in the book, Figures Traced in Light., pp. 260-264 Bordwell responds to Žižek's other criticisms in the online essay, \\"Slavoj Žižek: Say Anything\\". \\"Slavoj Žižek: Say Anything\\" Žižek's Theory of Genre In Chapter One, \\"Universality and Its Exception\\", Žižek draws on the linguistics research of Steven Pinker and the metaphysics of G. W. F. Hegel to argue for the structural necessity of what he calls \\"the exception\\" to universality. Pinker claims that our linguistic capacity derives from the interaction between two agencies: firstly, our ability to memorize strict rules and, secondly, our ability to then remember some odd exceptions to those rules. The example Žižek cites is the way in which children must learn the exceptions to verb patterns (saying 'bled' instead of 'bleeded', for example) in order to develop linguistic competence. The rule, then, does not function without its exception. Žižek claims that the structural necessity of the exception also applies to film genre. The issue of genre has always been a problematic one for film theorists (see, for instance, the debate over whether film noir is an aesthetic style or a genre). For Žižek, we locate the highest example of any genre in its exception, which Žižek defines as the work which articulates the conventions of the genre in an unconventional, non-formulaic way. An example here might be Martin Scorsese's film GoodFellas, which is often praised as being the ultimate gangster film, yet is hardly a typical example of the genre. Suture and Interface In Chapter Two, \\"Back To The Suture\\", Žižek laments the demise of the concept of \\"suture\\" in Lacanian film theory, writing that \\"the time of suture seems to have irrevocably passed: in the present-day cultural studies version of Theory, the term barely occurs; however, rather than accepting this disappearance as a fact, one is tempted to read it as an indication of the decline of cinema studies\\" (TFRT, p. 31). Žižek describes the \\"elementary logic of suture\\" as consisting of three steps: * \\"Firstly, the spectator is confronted with a shot, finds pleasure in it in an immediate, imaginary way, and is absorbed by it\\" (TFRT, p. 32). * \\"Then, this full immersion is undermined by the awareness of the frame as such: what I see is only a part, and I do not master what I see. I am in a passive position, the show is run by the Absent One (or, rather, Other) who manipulates images behind my back\\" (ibid). * \\"What then follows is a complementary shot which renders the place from which the Absent One is looking, allocating this place to its fictional owner, one of the protagonists\\" (ibid). The function of suture is to engage the viewer with the narrative events onscreen; the viewer is subjectively sutured into the narrative by the filmmaker(s), in order to keep him or her invested. Žižek then notes that there are some films which intentionally fail to produce the effect of suture; for instance, the films of Jean-Luc Godard pose a challenge to viewers used to more conventional narrative editing. Even the most successful use of suture does not result in the complete immersion of the viewer within the narrative, as Žižek says: \\"suture is the exact opposite of the illusory, self-enclosed totality that successfully erases the decentred traces of its production process: suture means that, precisely, such self- enclosure is a priori impossible\\" (p. 58). Žižek argues that it is not only avant-garde cinema in which suture sometimes fails. He claims that suture hides the fact that what Lacan calls \\"the big Other\\" does not exist. In Lacanian psychoanalysis, the big Other is the regulation of the domain of symbolic mandates. For instance, an individual may tell other people that they are a poet, but they are not truly a poet (and certainly not in the eyes of the big Other) until they have their poetry published by a legitimate company (and not, say, a vanity publisher). In his other work, Žižek frequently characterizes the big Other as a symbolic, inter-subjective fiction which we buy into in order for society to function. However, this fictional status of the big Other means that it does not actually exist and is therefore capable of being radically re-articulated (say, for instance, in an act of revolution). Žižek believes that although all of our thoughts and actions stand in relation to the big Other, we can occasionally glimpse the big Other's fictional status. Whereas suture serves to hide the fictional status of the big Other, avant-garde films in which suture does not function reveal the big Other to be a delicate fiction, vulnerable to violent disintegration. In between these two extremes are art film directors such as Kieślowski, who do not violently get rid of suture (and therefore conventional narrative meaning) in their films but, rather, allow the fictional status of the big Other to shine through in sublime moments. Žižek cites several examples of this technique (which he calls \\"interface\\"), two of which can be described here: * In Orson Welles' 1941 classic Citizen Kane, in the scene in which Kane makes his big political speech, Kane speaks before a giant poster of himself. Žižek compares this to large concert events in which, because the audience is so large, most people watch the performance on giant television screens. Žižek notes that it is wrong to claim that this makes the idea of a live performance a ridiculous one simply because the audience could view the same images in the privacy of their own home. Instead, he claims that what is important is the fact that the performer takes into account the existence of the giant screen and integrates it into their performance. In Citizen Kane, the moment when Kane swallows in close-up during his speech, with the gigantic static image of himself looking serious erected behind him, is a sublime moment. The gap between the small Kane at the lectern and the large, manufactured image of Kane behind him allows the purely fictional nature of the big Other to shine through. * In Kieślowski's A Short Film About Love, when Magda and Tomek speak to each other through a glass intercom in the local post office, the reflection of the characters' faces in the glass effectively creates the same effect as just described in Citizen Kane. The Fictional Nature of Reality and the Art of Kieślowski The \\"fright of real tears\\" referred to in the title of Žižek's book originates in Kieślowski's justification for moving from the documentary film form to making fictional feature films instead: \\"I'm frightened of real tears. In fact, I don't even know whether I've got the right to photograph them. At such times I feel like somebody who's found himself in a realm which is, in fact, out of bounds. That's the main reason why I escaped from documentaries\\" (Kieślowski, quoted in TFRT, p. 72). Žižek freely associates between the prohibition on real tears in Kieślowski to the Old Testament ban on images in order to remove degrading over-visibility from ethical significance. In contrast to the popular idea that we can only get to know the real person lurking beneath their adopted social persona once they 'drop the act', Žižek asserts that we can only get to know the truth of an individual's desire when we see them playing a fictional role. The example Žižek uses is that of a computer nerd who, as part of an interactive online game, adopts the persona of a sadistic murderer. It is not the case, claims Žižek, that this choice of persona hides a meek character beneath the fiction but, rather, that \\"in the guise of a fiction, the truth about [the geek] is articulated\\" (TFRT, p. 75). The fictional cinema of Kieślowski is then contrasted with a more general tendency in the European art film to 'show it all'. For instance, there is a growing list of mainstream films which contain scenes of unsimulated sex which, as a consequence, contain hardcore imagery more usually associated with pornographic films. However, Žižek also contrasts Kieślowski's position with the tendency of modern media to produce a discourse in which everything is openly and obscenely declared, such as confessions by public figures like the former U.S. President Bill Clinton. What this trend unintentionally produces, claims Žižek, is a situation in which discourse becomes impotent and words no longer have any power or effect. For a Marxist such as Žižek, this has important implications for political power struggles. Žižek therefore celebrates Kieślowski as a great artist for maintaining an aesthetic approach which insists on the fictional nature of truth and reality. References Further reading Žižek, Slavoj.

Early life Born in Buckhaven, Fife, he was the son of a coal miner, who was later killed in a pit accident. Educated at Buckhaven Senior Secondary School, he left school aged 14 to work part-time at Lochhead Colliery, while he trained as a mining engineer. Eadie stood for the Scottish presidency of the National Union of Mineworkers in 1961 against Alex Moffat, brother of the outgoing president Abe Moffat. Media commentators gave him little chance as a Fabian Society member in a union executive dominated by communists, but he came within 3,000 votes of victory. He was subsequently in 1965 elected to the Scottish NUM executive, representative for the county of Clackmannanshire. Political career Eadie joined the Scottish Labour Party in 1943, and was elected Scottish president of the Young Co-Operators in 1945. He later served as a member of the SLP Executive. He was a councillor on Fife County Council for 20 years, chairing the housing and education committees. Parliamentary career Eadie contested Ayr in 1959 and 1964, losing the second time to George Younger. In 1966 a vacancy arose in the mining constituency of Midlothian. Elected Member of Parliament in the 1966 general election with a majority of over 14,416, he warned in his maiden speech at the Palace of Westminster against closing the pits. His seat remained safe until his retirement in 1992, the only scare coming in 1974 when the Scottish National Party reduced his majority to just over 4,000. After co-sponsoring David Steel's Private Member's Bill which became the Abortion Act 1967, in January 1967 he became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Minister of Social Security, Margaret Herbison. However, along with seven other PPS's, he was sacked by Prime Minister Harold Wilson four months later for refusing to back Britain's application for Common Market membership. Wilson appointed Eadie opposition spokesman on energy in 1973, and served as junior minister for Energy during the Labour government of 1974 to 1979, serving under ministers Eric Varley and then Tony Benn. Eadie promoted research into wave, tidal and geothermal energy, and in 1976 secured the Joint European Torus (JET) nuclear fusion project for Oxfordshire, when the European Commission recommendation was for Italy. Eadie held the energy brief again in opposition under new Labour leader Neil Kinnock. Considered in 1983 as a replacement for Derek Ezra as chairman of the National Coal Board, the position was given to Sir Ian MacGregor, whom Eadie later blamed for the conflict that led to the miners' strike of 1984–85. As Labour's then shadow Energy spokesperson, he backed the strike, but was later critical of Arthur Scargill's leadership. After the strike, Eadie successfully led legal action against the NCB, which under a ruling from the Attorney General for England and Wales Sir Patrick Mayhew, recovered £120M in miners pension credits, which had been withheld during the strike. In the early 1970s, Eadie put forward a Private Members Bill that would have established the principle that no child in Scotland should be treated as incapable of being educated. After he became a junior minister in February 1974, he handed over the brief to Hamish Gray, then Conservative MP for Ross and Cromarty, with whom he became firm friends.

The 197 cars were built by Strømmens Verksted, Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri and AEG between 1960 and 1981. They were the first metro trains used in Oslo, and had remained in active use until being replaced by OS MX3000 trains in 2007. Each car is equipped with a driver's cab at one or both ends and four motors, each with . The cars are long, wide and tall. The trains use 750 V current, and are capable of . Signaling is provided through automatic train protection. In 1960, two less powerful T single-car units were built, designed to be prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both used to refer to the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on the western part of the network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8. History A T1000 car in original livery at Ryen Depot in 1965 In 1954, the Oslo City Council decided to build a four-line metro to the new suburbs to the east of the city center. The plans would lead to the system opening in 1966, after the conversion of the Østensjø and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway to metro standard, and supplemented with the new Furuset and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways. Røa The first two single-car trains were delivered in 1959 and given the designation T. They were delivered by Strømmens Værksted and NEBB as prototypes, without compensation from the planning office. They were tested on the Østensjø and Lambertseter Lines until 1 December 1960, when they were transferred to Bærumsbanen, who used them on the Kolsås Line. During their service they were prone to technical problems, and were more in the depot than in service. However, they gave valuable knowledge for the serial production. The trains were originally painted silver with a dark-blue cheatline and numbered 1 and 2. About 1970, they were repainted dark blue with a silver cheatline, and in 1971 given the numbers 451 and 452. The latter remained in service until 1977, when it was put aside, and scrapped in 1987. The former remained in service until it was put aside as defect, although it had rarely been used since 1982. It was fixed up and made operational again 1993, but was withdrawn the same year and scrapped the following year. Serial production started in 1964, with the bodies built at Strømmens Værksted, the motors built by NEBB and the electrical equipment by AEG. By 1978, 162 cars had been delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, named T1 through T4, with varying specifications. T1 was manufactured in 90 units from 1964 to 1966 for the opening of the Grorud Line and the conversion of the Lambertseter Line. The first 30 have driver's cabs in both directions (designated T1-2), while the latter 60 have it in only one end (designated T1-1). In 1967, 15 T2s were built for the conversion of the Østensjø Line. Although given a new designation, they are in all ways identical to the T1-1s. From 1969 to 1972, 30 T3s were built for the Furuset Line. Further expansions of the lines resulted in 37 T4s being built from 1976 to 1978. The T1000s are numbered 1001–1162. Holmenkollen The need for new rolling stock on the western suburban tramways prompted Oslo Sporveier to order a modified version to the T1000. This was because they had plans to connect the eastern and western networks, and gradually convert the western lines to metro standard. The T1300 units were built with the same specifications as the T1000, but were also equipped with pantographs so they could operate on the light rail lines. They also had a slightly different front. The initial order was for 33 units, which were designated T5 and T6. The former 18 units had a cab in one end, while the latter 15 had a cab in both ends, allowing Oslo Sporveier to operate single-car trains. The new units were put into service on the Røa and Sognsvann Lines, and were also used on the Kolsås Line outside rush-hour. To replace the aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were converted to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With the introduction of the T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline. Nydalen The Sognsvann Line was finished upgraded to metro standard on 7 January 1993, allowing the first T1000 trains to operate through the Common Tunnel into the western network, converting parts of the Oslo Tramway to metro. The Røa Line was finished on 19 November 1995, allowing all trains from the east to operate through the city center. To have sufficient metro- compatible trains, six two-car T2000 units were bought, and during the mid-1990s were considered to be a possible replacement for the T1000s. Starting in 1995, Oslo Sporveier made an interior and livery upgrade to the T1000 trains. The main red color to the exterior was kept, but the doors and around the windows were painted blue. The lights and seats were changed, and the latter colored gray. The interior walls were painted red at the end, white on the sides, blue on the doors and received yellow hand bars. Oslo City Council decided in 2003 to order 33 new three-car units from Siemens, that would be designated MX3000. In 2005, the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000, increasing the order by another 30 units. Following a labor dispute in 2006, it was decided that all rolling stock belonging to Oslo Sporveier would be transferred to a new holding company, Oslo Vognselskap. Jernbanetorget The first deliveries of the MX3000 were made in April 2007. The first T1000 was scrapped on 14 March 2007, and the last T1000 train was run on 19 July 2009. Oslo Tramway Museum has preserved seven T1000 cars: numbers 1002 (T1-2), 1018 (T1-2), 1076 (T1-1), 1089 (T1-1), 1092 (T2), 1129 (T3) and 1141 (T4). 1089 is displayed in the museum, the other six cars are meant to be kept as an operative train. Of the T1000 units, no. 1076 was the one to run the furthest, reaching before retirement. On 22 April 2010, the last T1300 was taken out of service, leaving only MX3000 units in service. Oslo Tramway Museum has preserved three T1300 cars: numbers 1306 (T5), 1320 (T6) and 1335 (T7, originally T4 no. 1155). The three cars are meant to be kept as an operative train. No T8 car was preserved. Specifications All versions have identical bodies, that are long, wide and high. Each car is equipped with two bogies, each with two axles. The axle distance is , the bogie distance is and the wheel diameter is . They are each equipped with four motors from NEBB, giving a maximum speed of . They each weigh . The electrical equipment was delivered by AEG.   * Valler The train's speed is controlled by an ATP system. The speed codes are transferred from the ATP points in the infrastructure, using 75 hertz pulses in the tracks. The trains pick up the signals via antennas. The speed codes are , , and . The permitted speeds are presented to the driver via displays in the driver's cab; in addition, the system will automatically reduce the speed, should the limit be exceeded. The driver can put the trains in an automatic mode, where the train adjusts its own speed to match the speed limit. The driver is always responsible for starting and stopping the train at stations. The prototype T series consisted of two single-car units. It had the same dimensions as the T1000 and T1300, but had four motors and weighed only . They were equipped with a pantograph and were bi-directional, but lacked ATP and third rail shoes. For the T1000-series, the T1-2 are the only to have a cab on both ends, although this is also featured on the T6. Since the T3, the trains have been delivered with electromagnetic brakes in addition to dynamic brakes, hand brakes and air brakes with. Models from T4 and onwards have larger cabs. The T1300 differ in that they had a pantograph and were built for conductors. The seating varies between the models: T1000 has a total capacity of 180 passengers, of which 63 can be seated. T5 has the same total capacity, but 70 people can be seated. T6 has a capacity for 154 people, of which 64 can be seated. T7 and T8 have a capacity for 177 passengers, of which 60 can be seated. All models are capable of operating six cars in multiple, although they are commonly used in shorter configurations.

The band was founded in 1996 by Deimon and Neru who were the first two for forming under the name December. Their early MCD demo, Torment that was recorded in January 1997 managed to get great sales under their original genre of black metal however after recording they disbanded for several years until 2001 when Neru and Jegger decided to reform the band under the name Tristwood. Deimon came back to the band and together in 2003 they began recording the MCD entitled Fragments Of The Mechanical Unbecoming. The MCD contained far more technical advancements using additional programming and synthesizers causing the band's output to be categorised under the Industrial side of music. In December 2003 the band went to work on their first full-length album Amygdala. Straight after the release a follow up album was made, Fragments… which saw the addition of a DVD and was classified as a limited box set. During that same year, an addition of vocals, Axumis was recruited. After the two releases the band then in 2005 re-produced previous MCD's on an EP compilation called Svarta Daudi which was recorded in only 10 hours. 2005 also saw the recording of the album The Delphic Doctrine in September. Some of their recordings were sent to the record company, Sound Riot Records who were very impressed with their work and offered a contract to the band. The Delphic Doctrine which was released in March 2006 has received more attention than any of their other releases thanks to Sound Riot Records and their pushing for Tristwood to do more and more tours. On the 30th of May 2006 the band acquired a new bassist, Yak. In 2008 they started to record their new record Dystopia et Disturbia, which will be released in 2010.

Late in his career, he collected and described Pachyrhinosaurus, Brachylophosaurus, Parksosaurus and Edmontonia. A contemporary author wrote, \\"No published study of Canadian dinosaurs is possible today without citing one or another of Sternberg's papers.\\" Early life Charles Mortram Sternberg was born in Lawrence, Kansas, from a family of famous American fossil collectors. Sternberg's highest level of education was a Kansas high school degree. Career Sternberg moved with his father and two brothers, Levi and George, to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1912. The four began working in Alberta collecting dinosaurs on behalf of the Geological Survey of Canada. This work was in competition with the American Museum of Natural History (New York) who were collecting many fossil skeletons and shipping them out of Canada. Following Lawrence M. Lambe's death in 1919, Sternberg assumed the role of director of paleontology enterprise of the Geological Survey of Canada. Sternberg's first paper appeared in 1921, supplementing Lambe's study of the Ankylosaur Panoplosaurus. Sternberg later took over the scientific description of fossil vertebrates for the Geological Survey. He published 47 papers on fossil vertebrates, mostly dinosaurs, many based on his own remarkable discoveries. In 1936 Sternberg and his son Ray Martin installed permanent metal quarry markers in 112 dinosaur quarries within Dinosaur Provincial Park. The critical site locality data for these specimens was thereby saved, thus ensuring that information was useful for the dinosaur biostratigraphic work that is so important today. In 1948 he was promoted to the rank of Assistant Biologist in the National Museum of Canada, which is the equivalent of curator. In 1949 he was elected a Fellow of Royal Society of Canada. Although he retired in 1950, his publications continued until 1970. \\"nominally retired\\" Sternberg later helped to establish Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta.

Situated next to the Pasing Town Hall, in a beautiful courtyard, the Pasing Viktualienmarkt offers everything you could wish for: bread and cheese, fish and meat, flowers and herbs. For almost a century the market has supplied the people of Pasing, who at that time were not citizens of Munich (that is why there are two markets called \\"Viktualienmarkt\\" in Munich), with fresh groceries in best quality. History The nomination of Pasing as a city in 1905 is the beginning of the history of Pasing Viktualenmarkt. The city council decided to establish a market for vegetables, fruits and plants on 9 July 1906. It was decided to hold the market at the south-western corner of the Pasing Marienplatz opposite the Institut der Englischen Fräulein. In January 1907 the Royal Government of Upper Bavaria granted permission for this. The layout of the market turned out to be something of a problem as everyone built their stalls in the way they wanted. Ultimately they came to terms and the first market day was held on 16 March 1907. From the beginning the market was well accepted, but the customers were only people from Pasing so that an efficiency calculation was carried out in 1908. This showed that the Viktualienmarkt in Pasing was not really profitable. The reason for this was that itinerant traders sold their goods more cheaply at the verge of the market as they did not have to pay a fee. This problem was solved by changing the market regulations. The constantly increasing traffic led to the relocation of the market in the courtyard of the municipal property Hindenburgstrasse (Baeckerstrasse), which was decided on 15 November 1929 by city councillor Dr. Hoesch. However, vendors did not agree with that decision as they feared an enormous drop in sales due to the lack of walk-in customers. With a delay of three months the relocation finally started on 1 April 1930. As the stalls could not be deconstructed, they had to be transported as a whole by carts. The relocation took a whole day. Despite the traders’ fears, the number of customers increased more and more so that they were soon running out of space again. For this reason they decided to finally build a solid, modern and large market hall. As work proceeded fast, they were able to move in already on 2 October 1937. On that day already eight of the twelve available stalls were occupied. Commodities such as fruits, berries, tropical fruits, poultry and milk were sold. The gardeners of Pasing also presented their wares. On the opening day the North Sea fish hall and the municipal cheap meat counter moved into the hall. From the opening in 1907 until today Pasing Viktualienmarkt has changed its appearance only insignificantly and even during renovation and reconstruction work it did not lose its unique character. That is why the people from Pasing have every right to be proud of their “Viktualienmarkt”. Administration The Wiener Markt ist organized by the Wholesale Market Munich. The Wholesale Market Munich, together with Pasing Viktualienmarkt, Viktualienmarkt, Wiener Markt, Elisabethmarkt and the Weekly Markets in Munich, are operated by Munich Markets, a municipal company run by the City of Munich.

Superhuman strength is an amorphous ability, varying in potency depending on the writer or the context of the story in which it is depicted. Characters and deities with superhuman strength have been found in multiple ancient mythological accounts and religions. Superhuman strength is a common trope in fantasy and science fiction. This is generally by means of mechanisms such as cybernetic body parts, genetic modification, telekinetic fields in science fiction, or magical/supernatural sources within fantasy. A plethora of comic book superheroes and super-villains display some degree of super strength. Some films invoke a fictional substance or drug that gives the superpower. The level of strength portrayed can vary greatly, from just outside the \\"normal\\" human range of the strongest weightlifters (e.g. unarmored Master Chief or Captain America), to nearly unlimited strength (e.g. Hulk, Superman, Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Thor, Hercules or Goku). Humans are actively trying to achieve superhuman strength via technology and scientific experimentation. Athletes have turned to various methods to improve performance, such as blood doping or taking anabolic steroids. Other technologies being researched are robotic exoskeletons to be worn by humans to enhance movement and strength.  History  Superhuman strength is a common ability of many gods and demigods in ancient mythology, such as Hercules/Heracles (Roman/Greek), Beowulf (Norse), Samson (the Bible), Bhima (Hindu) and Achilles (Greek). Attempts to modify the human body in order to gain extraordinary strength is common throughout history, as seen in fiction through characters such as Terminator, Robocop, Iron Man and Cyborg. Humans have tried to enhance their strength through the use of substances. Accordingly, “In ancient Rom, gladiators would drink herbal infusions to strengthen them before chariot races.” Currently, drugs including stimulants, anabolic steroids, diuretics and β-blockers are ingested to enhance strength and other attributes. Humans have tried to use external devices to enhance their strength. The earliest device that was patented for this specific purpose can be credited to Nicholas Yagn, who filed the patent in 1890. The device was described to be an “apparatus for facilitating walking, running, and jumping” through the use of bags of compressed air. The United States Department of Defense is considering a variety of technologies to create an exoskeleton intended for military use to enhance soldier performance.Hydra (ca. 1475) by Antonio del Pollaiuolo. The hero is known for his strength. Applications In the real world, extraordinary strength can occur via science. A person can become stronger, tougher, and more physically powerful than would seem humanly possible when using enhancements such as doping, substances and training. Records describe instances of people going beyond \\"normal\\" strength in specific circumstances without taking any specific measures, as in the case of Tom Boyle, who was able to lift the front of a car in order to rescue a person trapped beneath it. Penn State professor of kinesiology Vladimir Zatsiorsky stated that extraordinary strength can occur when a person engages their muscles through the conscious “exertion of will”. Zatsiorsky claims that trained athletes can improve their strength under specific conditions of competition. Fear can also cause a person to exhibit enhanced human strength. (see hysterical strength) The term appears in weight- lifting and 'protein formula' commercials without proof of their efficacy. Weight lifters and other athletes routinely perform feats that appear to be superhuman to others. For examples, in 2016 Blaine Sumner achieved the heaviest single bench press of 401.5 kg (885 lbs 2 oz). At the same competition he squat-lifted 500 kg. In 2016, Eddie Hall of the United Kingdom won the world record for heaviest deadlift at 500 kilograms (1,102 lbs 5 oz). Tom Boyle, Jr. in 2006  In fiction  Many fictional works involve superhuman strength, rooted in religious texts or in scientific form. The depiction of superhuman strength dates as far back as 900 BC to Greek mythology legends such as Hercules. Early legends portray characters gaining their superhuman strength from the gods and exhibiting characteristics of both heroic humans and gods. More recently superhuman strength is employed by characters called superheroes in comic books, which dates back to the 1930s. Characters such as The Incredible Hulk, Superman, and Wonder Woman possess the strength to perform physical feats impossible for the human body. These characters and their powers draw from earlier myths. Wonder Woman ostensibly descended from the Amazons, a group of women possessing superhuman strength. In many of these fictional works, the dilemma and solution lies in the character's superhuman abilities. Having these powers alienates them from society but also aids them in their quest. Recurring adaptations of well-known characters are often employed, which continue to perpetuate the use of superhuman strength in fiction.

The Marakkars speak Tamil in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka and Malayalam in Kerala.Kunhali, V. \\"Muslim Communities in Kerala to 1798\\" PhD Dissertation Aligarh Muslim University (1986) The community claim ancestry from marriages between early Arab Muslim traders of the high seas and indigenous coastal women.Cf.

Naturally, their children will have imbibed both the Islamic and the local values and transmitted both to their descendants. From the outset, the Arabs must, in all probability, have asserted the centrality of the Islamic values in their relationship with the local women, at the same time making the necessary adjustments to local customs. This is the pattern that appears to have survived to this day. Arab merchants arriving in boats at Thirukkurungudi temple  Religion  The Marakkayars, the early Muslim inhabitants of Coastal Tamil Nadu, are Sunnis of the Shaﬁ‘i school of thought (Madhab).  Economic Status  Most Marakkayars, are in some way or other, connected to foreign trade through which they became more advanced economically and socially than the other Muslim groups in the locality and even many Hindu sub-castes. The Marakkars were a known to be a powerful maritime spice trading community in the medieval South Asia. They traded in and with locations such as Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia in East Asia and South Asia, Maldives and Sri Lanka.Kunhali, V. \\"Muslim Communities in Kerala to 1798\\" Ph.D. Dissertation Aligarh Muslim University (1986) The Marakayar's have dominated the educational and economic landscape in Tamil Nadu since the 17th century.  Etymology  There are two main hypothesis regarding the etymology of the term 'Marrakayar', and it's various forms. = Tamil derivation = The first being from the term ‘Marakalarayar’ which may mean those who controlled or owned boats. In Tamil, 'marakalam' signiﬁes ‘wooden boat’ and 'rayar' means ‘king’ that it is the association of these two words that gives Marakkayar. = Arabized derivation = The second theory was derived from the arrival of Yemeni Arab royals (some of the first immigrants of this class) seeking refuge from persecutions who came by boats called ‘markabs’ in Arabic, and settled on the east coast. Their arrival in 'markabs', led to them being called Marakkayar by the local people, which literally means ‘boat people’.  Role in regional history  Marakkar Arabikadalinte Simham (Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea), a movie about Kunjali Marakkar's exploits Malabari Marakkars are credited with organizing the first naval defence of the Indian coast. With the emergence of the Portuguese in India, some Marakkars were forced to take up arms and enlist themselves in service of the Hindu king (the zamorin) of Calicut. The Marakkar naval chiefs of the Calicut were known as Kunjali Marakkars. The seamen were famous for their naval guerrilla warfare and hand- to-hand fighting on board. The Marakkar vessels — small, lightly armed and highly mobile — were a major threat to the Portuguese shipping all along the Indian west coast. In 1598, the Portuguese convinced the Zamorin that Marakkar IV intended to take over his Kingdom to create a Muslim empire. In an act of betrayal, the Zamorin joined hands with the Portuguese who brutally killed him.  Language  The Arabic language brought by the early merchants is no longer spoken, though many Arabic words and phrases are still commonly used. Until the recent past, the Tamil Muslim minority employed Arwi as their native language, though this is also extinct as a spoken language. They today use Tamil as their primary language with influence from Arabic. Many Arabic and Arabized words exist in the form of Tamil spoken by Marakkars. Among many examples, greetings and blessings are exchanged in Arabic instead of Tamil, such as Assalamu Alaikum instead of Sandhiyum Samadanamum, Jazakallah instead of Nandri and Pinjhan/Finjan for Bowl/Cup.There are also words which are unique to Marakkars and a few other Tamil Muslim communities such as Laatha for elder-sister, Kaka for elder-brother, Umma for mother and Vappa for father. There are also words derived from Sinhala such as Mattapa for terrace. There are also words from Purananuru era such as Aanam for Kulambu and Puliaanam for rasam or soup.  Marriage, traditions and ceremonies  = Ethnic discrimination = Till the 1970s, the Marakkayars did not intermarry with other Muslims groups in the locality whom they considered, in socio- economic terms, to be inferior to themselves. Susan Bayly says the Tamil Marakkayars have always looked down upon converted Muslims and had a higher social standing, being directly linked to Arabs.. Modern Marakkars are rather lax with such cultural restrictions, conforming with the principle of egalitarianism in Islam. But whether the change is to be attributed to Islamic principles alone is difﬁcult to determine, given that various social, political, and economic factors, could also quite reasonably be deemed to be relevant. = Marriage and ceremonies = Identiﬁcation of Hindu cultural presence in the ceremonies, and the extent of penetration and inﬂuence of Islamic values and customs, will be the primary concern of the observations following. Muslim marriages are by and large arranged by parents. This is because, in general, Tamil Muslims of the southern districts follow the Islamic kosha system, by which unmarried women hardly ever appear before strangers other than close relatives like brother, uncle or sister’s husband. Even now it is rare to see a Muslim woman without the traditional long white cloth (known as dupatti or dupatta) which wraps the body from head to foot, leaving open only the eyes to facilitate physical movement. When the parents decide to marry their son, it is they who seek out a suitable match. This is the normal pattern followed also by the Hindus and Christians. Due to the scarcity of prospective bridegrooms nowadays, it is usually the girl’s parents who take the initiative, but the status of the would-be groom and bride is also relevant. If the former has strong points in his favour, like high education, well-paid employment or proﬁtable business, then it is the parents of the would-be bride who will seek him out; similarly, if the bride has certain strong points in her favour, like being well-versed in religion or belonging to a reputed family, then the would-be groom’s parents seek her out. The initial contacts to decide on the marriage are sometimes under- taken by the parents themselves, especially if relatives or close friends are being sought. Sometimes contacts are made through family friends. Otherwise, tharagars or go-betweens, also known locally as brokers, are engaged to seek out a suitable partner, and are rewarded, sometimes handsomely, if their choice proves really excellent. The tharagars among Muslims, not as among the Hindus, are typically women. Men only very rarely perform this role for the simple reason that only women have access to the bride and generally such affairs take place between women alone. Even when the parents themselves go to the bride’s house to decide on the marriage, only the mother or married sister are allowed to see the bride and convey their opinion to the other. This contradicts the general Tamil Hindu tradition where the would-be groom accompanies his parents to the bride’s house to make a decision, and she presents herself before them, dressed in her best. Among both the Muslims and the Hindus, the bride is expected to be a virgin. The Marakkars were an endogamous community and followed the system of inheritance known as marumakkathayam. This type of marriage is preferred generally among Tamils, irrespective of religion and caste, mainly to maintain family ties and prevent property leaving the family. However, unlike among the Hindus, the daughter of the brother or sister of the bridegroom is not sought after for marriage. In any case, the murai marriage, as practised among the Marakkayars, is not contrary to Islamic law, given that it does not contradict the conditions for Islamic marriages stipulated in Surah 4 of the Holy Qur’an. Nowadays, as a result of government restrictions, Muslim parents do not marry off their daughters before eighteen. Generally, the young men get married while in their twenties. Consanguineous marriages, prevalent among the Hindus, are also quite frequent among the Muslims, marriage with ﬁrst cousins being very much preferred either the daughters of paternal or maternal uncles or aunts. To mark approval of, and formally ﬁnalize, the decisions taken during the preliminary contacts, traditionally known among the Tamil Muslims as mudivu pannuthal, the seeni poduthal function is held. The decisions, apart from the suitability of the marriage alliance and the wedding itself, involve three key elements. First, the giving of seethanam. This may comprise house, land or jewels, and is given by the parents of the bride and bridegroom to their daughter and son respectively. The exact nature and value of the seethanam are carefully determined. Second, the giving and exchanging of seeruarisai, which usually consists of gifts such as a scooter, dressing table, sofa set or utensils. Normally the bridegroom’s parents will give to the bride, more or less, the exact value of the seervarisai given by the bride’s household to the brid-groom. Third, the exact value of the dowry, which the bride’s parents must give to the groom or his parents is determined. The local Muslim term for dowry is the kaikooli or the hibbath, whereas the Hindus call it varadatchanai. Although all of these preceding elements are typically Tamil Hindu in character and do not have any justiﬁcation in a Muslim marriage, they remain in vogue. However, there are some Marakkayars who are conscious of their non-Islamic character and avoid them. Dowry and seethanam, despite being banned in Indian law, have not ceased to operate. The seeni poduthal function—in effect the betrothal— is the Muslim equivalent of the Hindu nichaiya thartham. It takes place in the presence of the Qad'i. All the decisions are conﬁrmed, and the transactions decided upon actually take place, during this function. Literally, seeni poduthal means the giving of sugar—in typical practice, white sugar, usually about 250 grams, a symbol of sweetness in life, is brought in a plate from the bride’s place to the groom’s. Sugar left over is then taken back to the bride’s house and the bride in her turn receives a pinch of it. Close relatives like the brother and the uncle are also given some sugar. Along with the sugar, a stainless steel or bronze vessel called kudam, containing milk, a symbol of abundance and prosperity, is also carried from the bride’s house and given to the groom. The type of kudam, and the quantity of milk that it should contain, are actually decided earlier, during the mudivu pannuthal contacts. Betel and betel nuts are also provided on this occasion, though no exchange of them takes place, as happens among many of the Hindu castes. After the sugar is given, a probable date for the wedding is decided. It may well take place on the same day, if the seeni poduthal has been held in the morning. Otherwise it can take place after a few weeks or after as long as six months or a year, according to convenience. There is no grand feast held after the seeni function as among certain Hindu castes. However, a small tea-party is held. It is worth noting that the entire function seems to be broadly intended, as among the Hindus, to inhibit further offers for either of the would-be partners. Ten years ago a vast majority of the marriages were conducted in the night, as the auspicious moments were calculated by lunar phases. Recently, however, most marriages (more than 90% according to my informants) are conducted during the day, especially during the midmorning between 10 and 12 o’clock, because night marriages have become too expensive. Sunday being the ofﬁcial holiday, marriages are generally held on that day. Daytime marriages are also preferred because of the better transport facilities available to those (especially women) who, having travelled far, wish to avoid staying overnight. A further reason may be that the Hindus typically prefer to attend weddings in the morning. However, unlike the Hindus, the Muslims very rarely celebrate marriages in the early morning. The day before the nikkah or marriage proper, the nalangu urututhal takes place in the bride’s house: the bride is given a special oil bath in water aromated with medicinal plants and roots. Later, her body is scented with specially prepared bridal perfumes. Maruthani (the local henna) is then applied to her hands and feet. The bridegroom is also subjected to thorough cleansing of the body and perfumes, but not as elaborately as in the case of the bride. The Marakkayars themselves, especially the religiously educated and well-informed, recognise the non-Islamic elements in their lives but do not perceive them to be in direct contradiction to the basic tenets of Islam, nor, excepting rare individuals, do they protest against them. On the contrary, they themselves consider that the lives they lead are a seamless whole. See also * Kunjali Marakkar * A. P. J.

History Loreto College Ballarat was the first Loreto school in Australia, established by Mother Gonzaga Barry and her community of religious sisters in 1875 following an invitation from the Bishop of Ballarat to establish a school for girls. This boarding school was known as Loreto Abbey Mary's Mount and was soon followed by a day school, also in Ballarat, known as Loreto Convent Dawson Street. Mother Gonzaga had come to Australia from Ireland and established local primary schools as well as Loreto schools in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. From its founding in 1875 until 1973, boys were admitted from kindergarten until grades two or three; since 1973, the school has admitted girls only. In 1978, Dawson Street Day School and Mary's Mount were formally amalgamated to form Loreto College Ballarat, with Years 7 - 8 at Dawson Street and Years 9 - 12 at Sturt Street - Mary's Mount. In 2007, Loreto's junior and senior campuses were combined on the one campus at Sturt Street following the construction of the Mary Ward Centre for Years 7 -8. The Dawson Street site closed in 2006, and was used by Ballarat High School for a short time before being bought by the Quest Apartments group. In 2015, the college opened The Mary's Mount Centre. This performing arts center houses a 500-seat theatre along with music and dance studios, classrooms and multimedia labs. Houses There are four houses at Loreto College Ballarat, named Barry, Mornane, Mulhall and Ward. The colours of the houses differ from school to school. At Loreto College Ballarat, Barry is red, Mornane is gold, Mulhall is green and Ward is blue. The houses are named in honour of great patrons of the school. Barry House is named after Mother Gonzaga Barry who led the first group of Loreto nuns to Australia from Ireland in 1875. She began the Loreto school in Ballarat, quickly following that with other schools across the country. She was a great pioneer in education opening teachers' colleges and preparing girls for university. Mornane House is named for Mother Stanislaus Mornane, who was one of the very early pupils of Loreto Abbey Ballarat in 1876 and became the first Australian Loreto pupil to enter the institute in Australia. She spent many years in Sydney where she was a teacher and Mother Superior. Mulhall House takes its name from Mother Stanislaus Mulhall. She arrived in Australia in 1897 teaching at Mary's Mount and for many years was the Mistress of Novices. Mother Mulhall had a passion for music and in 1915 followed Mother Gonzaga as Provincial Australian. Ward House is named after Mary Ward, foundress of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary (IBVM) as the Loreto nuns are officially called. Born in England in 1585, she travelled valiantly across Europe founding schools in many countries and setting up a new style of religious life. She died in 1645 confident that \\"women in time to come will do much\\".

This prevents the vehicle from being \\"hot wired\\" after entry has been achieved and thus reduces motor vehicle theft. Research shows that the uniform application of immobilisers reduced the rate of car theft by 40%. Description The electric immobiliser/alarm system was invented by St. George Evans and Edward Birkenbuel and patented in 1919. They developed a 3x3 grid of double-contact switches on a panel mounted inside the car so when the ignition switch was activated, current from the battery (or magneto) went to the spark plugs allowing the engine to start, or immobilizing the vehicle and sounding its horn. The system settings could be changed each time the car was driven. Modern immobiliser systems are automatic, meaning the owner does not have to remember to activate it. Immobilisers have been mandatory in all new cars sold in Germany since 1 January 1998, in the United Kingdom since 1 October 1998, in Finland since 1998, in Australia since 2001 and in Canada since 2007. Early models used a static code in the ignition key (or key fob) which was recognised by an RFID loop around the lock barrel and checked against the vehicle's engine control unit (ECU) for a match. If the code is unrecognised, the ECU will not allow fuel to flow and ignition to take place. Later models use rolling codes or advanced cryptography to defeat copying of the code from the key or ECU. The microcircuit inside the key is activated by a small electromagnetic field which induces current to flow inside the key body, which in turn broadcasts a unique binary code which is read by the automobile's ECU. When the ECU determines that the coded key is both current and valid, the ECU activates the fuel-injection sequence. In some vehicles, attempts to use an unauthorised or \\"non-sequenced\\" key cause the vehicle to activate a timed no-start condition and in some highly advanced systems, even use satellite or mobile phone communication to alert a security firm that an unauthorised attempt was made to code a key. Coincidentally, this information is often recorded in modern automobile ECUs, which may record many other variables including speed, temperature, driver weight, geographic location, throttle position and yaw angle. This information can be used during insurance investigations, warranty claims or technical troubleshooting. Availability Add-on immobilisers are available for older cars or vehicles that do not come equipped with factory immobilisers. The insurance approval for a self-arming immobiliser is known as \\"Thatcham 2\\" after the Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre in Thatcham, England. Approved immobilisers must intercept at least two circuits; typically the low-voltage ignition circuit and the fuel pump circuit. Some may also intercept the low-current starter motor circuit from the key switch to the relay. Statistics in Australia show that three out of four vehicle thefts are older cars stolen for joyriding, transport, or to commit another crime. Immobilisers are fitted to around 45% of all cars in Australia, but account for only 7% of those cars that are stolen. In many instances where a vehicle fitted with an immobiliser has been stolen, the thief had access to the original key. Only around one in four stolen vehicles are stolen by professional thieves. The majority of vehicles are stolen by opportunistic thieves relying on finding older vehicles that have ineffective security or none at all. Honda was the first motorcycle manufacturer to include immobilisers on its products in the 1990s. In September 2007, a Transport Canada regulation mandated the installation of engine immobilisers in all new lightweight vehicles and trucks manufactured in Canada. Cracking Numerous vulnerabilities have been found in the immobilisers designed to protect modern cars from theft. Many vehicle immobilisers use the Megamos-chip, which has been proven to be crackable. The Megamos transponder is one of many different transponders found in today's immobiliser systems and also comes in many different versions. Hacking of an immobiliser in the real world would be performed on the vehicle, not on the key. It would be faster to program a new key to the vehicle than to try to clone the existing key, especially on modern vehicles. Some immobiliser systems tend to remember the last key code for so long that they may even accept a non-transponder key even after the original key has been removed from the ignition for a few minutes.Volkswagen Immobiliser Failure  Effectiveness  A 2016 study in the Economic Journal finds that the immobiliser lowered the overall rate of car theft by about 40% between 1995 and 2008. The benefits in terms of prevented thefts are at least three times higher than the costs of installing the device.

Mythology The Shiva temple at Singheswar, also called Singheshwarsthan, has religious significance since ancient times, as this land was the meditation place of Rishi Shringi. Hence, this place is considered to be the most pious for the Hindus. It is said that during the Ramayana period a Putreshthee Yajna was performed by Raja Dashratha and he was blessed with four sons from the prasad “Charu” of that mahayajna. The great Sringhi Rishi (Rishyasringa) primarily worshipped Lord Shiva on the occasion of that yajna. Seven “Havana Kunds” created at that time has been converted into a ravaged tank now. Eventually the residential place of Sringi Rishi became famous as Singheshwar. It is visited by lakhs of pilgrims. Sundays and Mondays are very important for the devotees. Mahashivratri Mela (which is one of the Rajkiya Mela of Bihar) of Singheshwarasthan is famous. Reference of Singheshwarasthan has been found in Varaha Purana too. According to that purana this place was once surrounded with forests. During the course of cattle grazing they observed that a virgin cow used to sprinkle milk at a particular place. The cattle roamers saw the strange action of that cow one day and began to dig at that place. After digging they got a Shivlinga which they began to worship. Gradually people become aware of this incident and in course of time a small temple was constructed there. The mythological story behind this place is that Goddess Maha Kali, Maha Laxmi and Maha Sarswati are assimilated into the form Goddess Durga and she being lion rider is called Singheshwari. Her counterpart Lord Brahma. Vishnu and Mahakal Shankar are assimilated into the form of eternal god is called Singheshwar. Three part of the Shivling is the expression of Trimurti. It is said that pundit Mandan Mishra was residing and a scholarly debate on religion was held between Mandan Mishra and Adi Sankaryacharya. After that debate Pt. Mandan Mishra adopted the cult sanatan. Lord Buddha’s statue of Avalokiteshwara on the southern wall of the eastern-sided temple shows the acceptance of Lord Shiva’s eternal Omnipresence.

Duomarco (September 27, 1905 - November 25, 1985) was a Uruguayan 20th century scientist who introduced innovative ideas in the fields of medical physics and cardiac and venous physiology.  Life  Duomarco was born September 27, 1905 and died November 25, 1985 in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was the son of Uruguayan parents of Spanish origin. He received his primary and secondary education from public institutions of Montevideo and his medical education from the School of Medicine of the Universidad de la República (Uruguay), from April 1924 to December 1930. His investigations took place in the laboratories of that same School of Medicine, and also in Montevideo public hospitals. His research work (his hobby) ran parallel to his medical practice as a heart specialist in Varela Fuentes and Rubino Private Clinic and in public hospitals. He was as attentive to his patients as he was to his experiments. During his lifetime, Duomarco was a member and sometime president or vice president of the following Scientific Societies: :1. Sociedad Uruguaya de Cardiologia, :2. Sociedad de Biología de Montevideo and :3. Asociación Uruguaya Para el Progreso de la Ciencia. During the 1947-1948 academic year and after being awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, he worked under Professor Carl Wiggers at the Department of Physiology of the School of Medicine of Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. On October 25, 1948, Professor Wiggers wrote: :\\"As I look back to last year, I realize again and again how much we appreciated having you with us. Your stimulating ideas proved very valuable even if I did not always agree with you fully. However, if we all agreed it would be very unfortunate for experimental science, for there would not then be anything for us to do.\\"Duomarco's correspondence file On June 15, 1970, the Universidad de la Republica, through its School of Medicine, granted Duomarco the title of Professor ad-Honorem.  Work  = Books = Duomarco seconded by his friend Ricardo Rimini published two books: :1. . ('Intra- abdominal pressure in man in normal and pathological conditions'); Buenos Aires: El Ateneo; 1947. Bernardo A. Houssay, an Argentinian professor and the 1947 \\"Physiology or Medicine\\" division Nobel Laureate, prefaced this book. Houssay wrote: :\\"No han faltado observadores y experimentadores que han emprendido este estudio en diferentes épocas, pero los doctores Duomarco y Rimini han realizado una obra más importante que sus predecesores porque han llevado a cabo una investigación más amplia y más completa que se apoya en hechos de observación y además discuten las aportaciones y las hipótesis de los autores precedentes. (...) :Esta obra es un esfuerzo metódico, razonado, paciente y perseverante, que merece el mayor elogio por la manera cómo se ha llevado a cabo y por la importancia del problema. Ha de dar lugar seguramente a nuevos estudios y a discusiones que harán progresar nuestros conocimientos.\\"Preface. pp. 7–8 :: (It is certain that along different times, observers and researchers have questioned themselves on the problem of abdominal pressure, but Doctors Duomarco and Rimini have worked out, by far, a broader and more complete study of the subject than that of their predecessors. They have based their results on factual observations besides discussing the hypothesis and contributions of the other authors. (...) This monograph is the consequence of methodic, intelligent, steadfast and perseverant work and deserves utmost praise for its accomplishment and for the importance of the subject, it analyzes. This book will surely be the basis for new studies and discussions that will lead to new advancements of science.) :2.

Blas Moia, a distinguished Argentinian cardiology professor, prefaced this second book. :\\"Los autores de este libro excepcional han dedicado buena parte de su vida médica al estudio de la circulación y de la presión venosa.

(...) :En síntesis, esta obra es una contribución ejemplar al conocimiento racional de la fisiología y fisiopatología de la presión venosa, sin el cual sería imposible interpretar adecuadamente los hallazgos semiológicos en el ser humano normal y enfermo. Por eso sus conclusiones son de aplicación eminentemente clínica y permitirán al médico valorar acertadamente los hallazgos realizados a la cabecera del enfermo, muchas veces aun sin el empleo de instrumento alguno.\\"Preface. pp. VI-VIII :: (The authors of this exceptional book have dedicated a significant part of their medical life to the study of circulation and of venous pressure. The notion that veins do not behave as rigid tubes but as eminently collapsible tubes suffering from the process of collapse in different situations depending on local conditions and on the position of the body, although perceived by LOWER in 1669 and studied by HOLT in 1941, needed to be categorically demonstrated so that it could establish itself definitely. (...) Conclusively, this book is an outstanding contribution to the rational knowledge of venous pressure physiology and physiopathology and an indispensable contribution to an adequate understanding of semiological findings in normal and sick humans. For this reason, its conclusions are of eminent clinical application and they will allow the physician a correct evaluation of his findings, many times, even without making use of any specific instruments.) =Papers= Duomarco, when a very young medical student and enthusiastic on recent insulin studies, published in 1928 his first paper: “Sobre fisiopatología de la diabetes” (On Physiopathology of Diabetes) in “El estudiante libre” a medical students magazine. Seventy years later, the Uruguayan Post commemorated this event with the emission of a stamp honoring him. When already a renowned investigator, enthusiastic on space travel, Duomarco published in 1970 his last paper: “Venous Pressure of Man in Space” in the Journal of Aerospace Medicine. Duomarco published around one hundred and thirty papers. Some of those papers can be found here and here.

The revolt succeeded in driving out the Selucids, and the rededication of the Second Temple at the end of the revolt is commemorated by the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. After expelling the Selucids, the Maccabees formed the Hasmonean dynasty, which ruled Judea in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE.

Umm el-Umdan 1926 Modern city The modern city was founded in the late 20th century. The city of Modi'in was built in the 1990s, and it was later merged with the nearby towns of Maccabim and Re'ut, which had been founded in the 1980s, to create the unified municipality of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. Modern Modi'in was built over a number of depopulated Palestinian villages: Bir Ma'in, Al-Burj and Barfiliya. =Maccabim-Re'ut= In 1985, the construction of the town of Maccabim, which was led by the International Maccabi organization began, and the project of founding nearby Re'ut, led by an association of Israeli army officers, started in 1987. The towns were united into Maccabim-Re'ut in 1990. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from two Palestinian villages for the construction of Maccabim, presently part of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut: 1,499 dunams from Beit Sira Beit Sira Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 17 and 471 dunams from Saffa.Saffa village profile, ARIJ, p. 17Other statistics published by ARIJ claim that in the wake of the 1967 war, 1680 dunams (415 acres) were confiscated to Israel, of which 840 dunams (207.5 acres) were initially designated for Maccabim settlement, while the remaining lands annexed to Israel without any designation. See: POICA – Beit Sira: A Palestinian Village on the verge of diminishing, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem =Modi'in= The cornerstone of Modi'in was laid in 1993. It was built as a modern planned city with high standards of urban planning. Environmental issues and future growth were taken into consideration from the early design stages. Large greenspaces were incorporated into the city's layout and comprise 50% of the area within the city limits. The city was opened for residency in 1996. =Modi'in- Maccabim-Re'ut= In 2003, the Israeli Interior Ministry unified Modi'in and Maccabim-Reut into a single city. Population development High-rise development in Modi'in Modi'in has become a magnet for Jerusalem residents displeased with the capital's growing Haredi character. Thousands of residents of Rosh HaAyin, Lod, and Ramla have also relocated to Modi'in. In 2008, it was decided to cap the growth of Modi'in to allow for the development of Lod and Ramla. The city was planned by the well-known architect Moshe Safdie. Territorial status controversy In 2012, the European Union reclassified the small part of Modi'in originally founded as the community of Maccabim as a West Bank settlement since it had been established in the Latrun salient no man's land according to the 1949 Armistice Agreement. The effect of this redefinition was to deny the affected area (which is exclusively green-leaf residential) a range of preferential tax benefits that would normally be conceded on Israeli products exported to Europe.Ora Coren, 'European Union: Parts of Modi'in Do Not Belong to Israel', Haaretz, 14 August 2012 The decision was made to implement a 2010 ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The move sparked off a diplomatic controversy. Socio- economic status According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the city is rated at level 8 out of 10 on the scale of socio-economic development, with a high proportion of high school graduation, 76.5% (2006–07), and an average monthly income of 9,659 NIS, compared to a national average of 7,466 (2006). Modi'in has attracted a large community of olim (Jewish immigrants) from English-speaking countries. City plan Azrieli Mall in central Modi'in Wadi Anaba Park west of the city center The original city of Modi'in is laid out around a central hub, with the main arterial spokes organized as dual carriageways. Each side of the artery is a one-way street, and in between is a wide green space, with linear parks, playgrounds, schools, and some small commercial centers. Short lateral stubs fed by continuous-flow intersection turn lanes allow drivers to traverse the green spaces and effect a U-turn onto the artery's opposite direction lanes. These stubs also serve as the entranceways for the schools and mini-malls, preventing parking traffic from blocking the high-speed, left lanes of the arteries. The right shoulders of most arteries do, however, allow parking, except in the pullouts for bus stops, next to fire hydrants, etc. The city center is a large traffic circle punctuated by traffic lights. On the north side of the circle is the central train station, to the northeast is the Azrieli shopping mall (pictured), and to the west and south is the Anaba park (also pictured), which contains a small artificial lake used for recreational boating. The traffic circle straddles a major northeast–southwest artery, HaHashmona'im Blvd., that connects to the southwest with route 431 (which has its eastern terminus in south Modi'in and extends west to Rishon LeZion), and to the northeast with route 443 (at Shilat Junction) providing connectivity to Jerusalem (southeast) and Lod (northwest). Approximately west-northwest of the city center is an industrial zone, and to the west (on route 431) is the Yishpro commercial center. The latter is also accessible via an additional Modi'in train station, Paatei Modi'in (, \\"Modi'in outskirts\\"). The industrial zone is also linked to route 443 via its own interchange, between Shilat Junction and the Maccabim Junction at the eastern side of the Ben Shemen JNF forest. This keeps most of the commercial traffic out of the city proper, so that the two arteries between the city and its industrial zone (Emek HaEla and HaShdera Hamerkazit) carry primarily commuters rather than trucks. The long-term projection of the Ministry of Housing is for the city to be home to 240,000 residents. However, plans approved thus far are for 120,000 residents. =Neighborhoods= Neighborhoods of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut Park Modi'in השבטים HaShvatim - The Tribes (North Buchman/Buchman) and מוריה Moriah (South Buchman) are the most southern neighborhoods in the city. Most of the buildings in this neighborhood are ground-level private homes and condos. The streets of Shvatim are named after the tribes of Israel, and the streets of Moriah are named after ancient historical Jewish figures. Moriah, the name of the southern neighborhood, is also a feminine name representing these women. הפרחים HaPrachim - The Flowers (Miromi) is a small neighborhood in the city center. Located in HaPrachim is a commercial center, two primary schools and a secondary school. The neighborhood's streets are named after trees, flowers, and plants. At the northern part of the neighborhood there is a small compound where the streets are named after phrases from the Song of Songs. הנחלים HaNachlim - The Rivers (Safdie) and משואה Masuah - Beacon (Givat C) are located towards the west of the city, and were planned by architect Moshe Safdie. Located in these neighborhoods are five commercial centers, a secondary school and three primary schools. The central street names are named after valleys in Israel, and the side streets are named after Israeli rivers and streets. The name \\"Masuah\\" was selected in order to represent the neighborhood's high altitude. Within the area consisting of the streets named after rivers and streams is the \\"Malibu\\" area, which, as with other areas, is colloquially named after the contractor who designed the neighborhood. הכרמים HaKramim - The Vineyards (Tsipor) is the northernmost neighborhood in Modi'in. The streets are named after the Hebrew months. The name \\"Kramim\\" is in honor of the vineyards that were located where the neighborhood now stands before the city was founded. אבני חן Avnei Chen - Precious Stones (Kaizer) is located towards the west of the city, and parts of it are still under construction. The main road is named \\"Avnei Choshen\\" and leads to the only retail under residential mixed use buildings in Modi'in. Other streets, in keeping with the neighborhood's name, are named for precious stones. The parks are connected through the center of the neighborhood and allow pedestrians to cross. A bike lane in the Emek Zvuloon street leads to the center of town. הנביאים HaNevi'im - The Prophets (Northern Shimshoni) and המגינים HaMeginim - The Defenders (Southern Shimshoni) are located towards the northwest of the city. Streets in HaNevi'im are named for the Prophets of Israel, while HaMeginim's streets are named after generals and important battles in Israeli history. Located in the neighborhoods are three commercial centers, three primary schools, and one secondary school. הציפורים HaTsiporim - The Birds (South Kaizer) is still being planned. Its streets will be named after different species of birds, and will be a relatively small neighborhood consisting of only seven streets. Culture Modi'in cultural auditorium Sports =Baseball= In 2007, Modi'in was selected as one of the inaugural cities for the Israel Baseball League. The baseball team was named the Modi'in Miracle, but did not play games in Modi'in as there is no baseball stadium there. =American Football= In 2008, the Pioneers of the Israeli Football League (American Football) relocated to Modi'in. The Pioneers played all their home games in Modi'in. In their first year, the Modi'in \\"Dancing Camel\\" Pioneers won the IFL Championship. After an unsuccessful 2009–10 season, their second in Modi'in, the Pioneers relocated once again to Tel Aviv, where most of the team's players lived. Transportation View towards Modi'in Central Railway Station and main commercial district Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut is accessible by Road 431, Highway 3 and Road 443. An Israel Railways line began operation on April 1, 2008 to a large underground station in Modi'in. Service began in September 2007 to Paatei Modi'in on the western outskirts of the city. This railway connects Modi'in to Tel Aviv by way of Ben Gurion Airport. The line to Modi'in is a spur off the high-speed railway to Jerusalem, currently due for completion in 2016. Once this line is completed, Modi'in will be within 30 minutes' ride of Jerusalem. Intercity and local bus services are provided by Kavim.

Asian-style fishcakes usually contain fish with salt, water, flour and egg. Fish cakes can be made by the combination of fish paste and surimi. The combined product is then shaped and left to cool. They are then battered and breaded using a machine. Then, they are usually fried with oil at around and should reach the internal temperature of . After the cooking process, they are frozen and packaged and are kept frozen until used. European-style fishcakes are similar to a croquette, consisting of filleted fish or other seafood with potato patty, sometimes coated in breadcrumbs or batter. Fishcakes as defined in the Oxford Dictionary of Food and Nutrition are chopped or minced fish mixed with potato, egg and flour with seasonings of onions, peppers and sometimes herbs. The fishcake has been seen as a way of using up leftovers that might otherwise be thrown away. In Mrs Beeton's 19th century publication Book of Household Management, her recipe for fishcakes calls for \\"leftover fish\\" and \\"cold potatoes\\". More modern recipes have added to the dish, suggesting ingredients such as smoked salmon and vegetables.  History  = China = According to Chinese folk tales, fish cakes have had more than 4000 years' history. In ancient times, an emperor called Shun travelled to Southern China with his two wives. After a long period of travel, his consorts were tired and had bad appetites. This caused Shun to worry, and he searched for ways to resolve the problem. A fisher called Bo came and gave Shun his fish cakes. Shun's consorts really enjoyed them, and their appetites returned to normal. Shun was so pleased that he asked the fisher Bo to teach other people how to make fish cakes, so everyone can enjoy food even when they have bad appetites. Fish cakes then became popular in China. Later in the history, a famous version of fish cake occurred during Guangxu Emperor's reign in the Qing Dynasty (1875-1908). Guangxu Emperor's wife, Zheng loved fish cakes. She brought the fish cakes' recipe into the forbidden city, where royal family lived. With Royal cooks' improvement to the recipe during practise, Zheng's fish cakes eventually became famous. However, the fish cakes also disappeared after Zheng was murdered. = Japan = = Korea = Japanese fishcakes were introduced to Korea during the Japanese occupation (1910–1945), and the first eomuk processing plant in Korea was DongKwangFood in Bupyeong Kkangtong Market during 1950s in Busan.\\"The Present Status of Fisheries Processing Industry and Fishery Products of Busan in the Colonial Period\\", 김승, 역사와 경제 Vol.101, 2016 In 1953, Park Jae-Deok who learned eomuk processing from Japan founded Samjin Fish Cake which has the longest history in Korea. It was shortly after the outbreak of Korean War and many refugees migrated to Busan, resulting in booming eomuk industry.\\"A study on the Formation Process of Food Culture in Busan -Based on raw fish and eomuk\\", 김정하, 세계해양발전연구 Vol.22, 2013 In early 1990s, Busan-eomuk commonly sold in food trucks became a trend. The term Busan-eomuk started referring to long, sausage shaped eomuk. Since the food trucks usually served eomuk with a hot broth, eomuk became one of the most popular fast food in winter season. Even in contemporary Korea, eomuk food truck can be easily spotted on major downtown streets.\\"History of Busan Eomuk: The story of Busan Eomuk\\", 백승제, 부산발전연구원 부산학연구센터, 2015 In 2010s, eomuk industry in Korea goes through a major transformation from the public perception of eomuk as a fast food to a recognized delicacy. In 2013 December, Samjin Fish Cake established an eomuk bakery, for the first time in Korea. Up to this day, Samjin Fish Cake solidified unique conception and image of eomuk. Other eomuk processors attempted to transform their stores and diversified their menu to secure lucrative position and remain competitive.\\"The secret to the growth of Samjin Eomuk that leading a wind of change\\", Foodnews, 18 January 2017.  Composition  Commonly, fishcakes used cod as a filling; however, as cod stocks have been depleted, other varieties of white fish are now used, such as haddock or whiting. Fishcakes may also use oily fish such as salmon for a markedly different flavour. Fishcakes have also traditionally been made from salted fish (most commonly cod, haddock, or pollock). Fishcakes are also prepared without breadcrumbs or batter, and are made with a mixture of cooked fish, potatoes, and occasionally eggs formed into patties and then fried. As fish has traditionally been a major dietary component of people living near seas, rivers, and lakes, many regional variations of the fish cake have arisen. Variations can depend on what type of fish is used; how finely chopped the fish is; the use of milk or water; the use of flour or boiled potatoes; the use of eggs, egg whites, or no eggs; the cooking method (boiling, frying, or baking); and the inclusion of other ingredients (for example, shrimp, bacon, herbs, or spices). = Bermuda = In Bermuda, they are known as Bermuda fishcakes and are made especially during Easter, but also throughout the year. Here fishcakes are normally eaten between hot cross buns. = Canada = In Newfoundland and Labrador, the fish is generally salted cod flakes and is blended with mashed potatoes. Savory is used instead of parsley, along with minced sweated onions. The cakes are then formed into rounds and cooked in oil or pork back fat until golden brown. = Caribbean = In Barbados, fishcakes are made from salted codfish and flour batter, then fried in oil. = Denmark = In Denmark, fiskefrikadeller (fishcakes) are slightly elongated, pan-fried patties much like regular frikadeller. They are normally not breaded. A similar dish which is boiled, rather than fried, is called fiskeboller and added to certain soups, though it may be closer to a fish version of a knödel. In Southern Jutland, fiskefrikadeller sometimes contain smoked pork fat. = India = In West Bengal, several local fish species (mostly riverine) are prepared and eaten in deep-fried breadcrumb covered fishcakes, locally called maacher chop. The item is very popular as an appetizer during middle-class Bengali festivities. = Indonesia = Indonesian varieties of fishcakes are locally known in South Sumatra as pempek or empek-empek. The traditional South Sumatran pempek is served with kuah cuka (\\"vinegar sauce\\"). These fishcakes are usually round or tube-shaped. Pempek Bangka.JPGPempek bangka = Israel = In Jewish cuisine, gefilte fish are patties of white fish mixed with matzoh or challah, poached in the skin of the fish. = Japan = In Japan, white fish is puréed and steamed into a loaf called kamaboko. Fried fishcakes, such as satsumaage and various fried Kamaboko in which is added onions, burdock, minced squid and shrimps are also popular. Fishcakes in Japan are commonly made from surimi, a paste made primarily from fish meat and Mirin, starch, egg whites and spices. After formation, they are commonly fried or boiled before packing and distribution. Based on the Japanese Food Regulations, Fish Cakes made from Fish Paste should be sterilized for 45 minutes at 80℃, measured in the centre. After sterilization, the fish paste should also be stored below 10℃ with frozen fish pastes requiring a minimum storage temperature below -15℃. Chikuwa.jpgChikuwa Kamaboko.jpgKamaboko Hanpen by yoppy.jpgHanpen Satsumaage.jpgSatsuma-age = South Korea = In South Korea, fishcakes are called eomuk () or odeng (, which is a loan word from the Japanese stew, oden). Fish cakes are mainly made of corvina or cuttlefish which contains less fat. This is because fatty fish are not suitable for making fishcakes. Salt, sugar, flour, and starch are necessary ingredients as well. Also, other ingredients may be added in order to make fishcakes: onions, carrots, green onions, and cooking wine. It is normal to add several chemicals in order to have a better flavor such as D-sorbitol (an artificial sweetener which has approximately 60% of the sweetness of sugar so that diabetic patients can consume), soy protein (protein extracted from soy which can make it possible to create a better texture of fish cakes with less amount of fish fillets), and D-xylose (a natural sweetener with low calories), or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Usually made by deep-frying paste made from ground fish, eomuk can be boiled with other ingredients to make eomuk-tang (; \\"fishcake soup\\") or eomuk-jeongol (; \\"fishcake hot pot\\"), stir-fried to make eomuk-bokkeum (), and put in various dishes such as jjigae and gimbap. Sold from street carts, eomuk can be boiled on a skewer in broth. The broth is sometimes provided to the customer in paper cups for dipping and drinking.Goldberg, Lina \\"Asia's 10 greatest street food cities\\" CNN Go. 23 March 2012. Retrieved 2012-04-11 Hot bar, also written as hotbar, is another version of eomuk sold during cold weather. While still served on a stick or skewer, the hot bar is deep-fried instead of boiled. In this form, the hot bar can be prepared according to any particular vendor's 'secret' recipe: plain, mixed with vegetables such as diced carrot or whole perilla leaf, or served with any number of sauces or condiments including ketchup and mustard. It often in broth with mul-tteok, which is long and salty rice cake.

In Burmese it is called \\"Nga Phal\\". Fishmongers use oyster shells or spoon to scrab the meat of the fish to sell. The meat of the fish is slammed or pounded several times in the mortar and pestle to get the chewy texture together with herbs and spices. After that formed in the shape of small patty for frying. The shape and size may vary from place to place. = Norway = In Norway, \\"fiskekaker\\" are made much like the Danish fiskefrikadeller. They are fried and served with potatoes or pasta, broccoli and raw grated carrot, and often brown sauce instead of white. The type of fish used vary with availability and recipe: Pollock, haddock, herring, wolf-fish and even salmon or trout are sold, and they are often marketed named after the fish they are made of; Seikaker, Koljekaker, Steinbitkaker, etc. Terms like \\"burger\\" is also used; \\"Lakseburger\\", \\"Fiskeburger\\". Additionally there are fishballs and fishpudding, both more often served with white sauce. = Portugal = In Portugal, pastéis de bacalhau (codfish pasties) are a type of very popular fishcake. Pastéis are made of potato, codfish (bacalhau), parsley, and eggs. Bolinho de bacalhau.jpgBolinhos de bacalhau = Puerto Rico = In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, bacalaítos are eaten either as a snack or as part of a meal. = Romania = In Romania, fishcakes are called chiftele de peşte and are made with carp. = Singapore = Fishcakes and fish balls are prepared from one or more kinds of fish. They may contain starch, additional condiments or government permitted colouring agents. Fishcakes must contain at least 40% of fish under governmental regulations. Homemade fishballs and fish cakes can also be made using store bought or homemade fish paste. Fish paste that are sold commercially have to contain more than one fish, with possible additions of condiments, colouring agents or starch. Based on the Singaporean government Food Regulations, Fish Pastes should contain at least 70% fish. Homemade fish cakes are usually made from mackerel because of its sweeter taste and ease in preparing. Fish paste mixtures are often put in food processors or traditionally thrown against the side of mixing bowls to achieve the bouncier texture of fish cakes. They are then shaped by hand or in molds into various shapes and sizes and stored in the refrigerator or freezer till use. = Saint Helena = In Saint Helena, fishcakes are made from locally caught tuna or wahoo scraped into mashed potato with herbs and spices, then moulded into cakes and fried in oil. They are often spicy or, as locals would describe, \\"with bite\\". = Sweden = In Sweden, canned are widely found; in contrast to , they are not fried but boiled and as a result are almost entirely white. = Thailand = In Thai cuisine, the fish is first mashed and then mixed with chopped yardlong beans, fresh cilantro (including stalks), fish sauce, kaffir lime leaves, red curry paste, and an egg binding. This is deep-fried and usually served with a sweet chilli dipping sauce. Thot man pla have become popular around the world. Thanin market tod man pla.jpgThot man pla at a market in Chiang Mai Steamed curry fish cake by Leela (17320946385).jpgSteamed fish cake = United Kingdom = In Yorkshire, England, the \\"Yorkshire fishcake\\" is a variation traditionally served in many fish and chip shops in South Yorkshire, parts of West Yorkshire, and the East Riding of Yorkshire. It consists of two slices of potato (sometimes parboiled), with offcuts of fish in between, deep fried in batter. Yorkshire fishcakes can also be known as scallop fishcakes, or fish patties. TV chef Brian Turner has made the recipe available via his website. Another variation of the fishcake is the parsley cake which is sold in some fish and chip shops in and around Castleford, West Yorkshire, England. It consists of minced fish, mashed potato and fresh parsley, coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried. = Vietnam = In Vietnam, fishcakes are made of fresh fish, sometimes along with flour. The fishcakes can either be fried or steamed/boiled. = Philippines = In the Philippines fishcake is eaten as street food and as a component, topping on dishes like noodle soup. Fish balls are eaten as street food, usually on a skewer or in a cup, paired with a dipping sauce. They are usually ball-shaped or cylinder-shaped. is another variety where it is almost prepared like an eggroll. A mix of fish and/or shrimp and ground pork is wrapped in bean curd skin (), before steaming and then frying.  Nutrition  The nutrients in fish cakes are mainly contributed by freshwater fish, the main ingredient in fish cakes. Asian-style fish cakes are usually high in protein, calcium, and low in fat. For example, per 100g of Japanese fish cakes (kamaboko) has approximately 113.6 Calories, in which 12.3g are carbohydrates (4%) (including dietary fiber of 0.12g), 13.2g protein (26%), 0.67g fat (1%) (composed of 0.092g saturated fat, 0.33g polyunsaturated fat and 0.078g monounsaturated fat), 48.0 mg cholesterol (16%), 845.5 mg sodium (35%), and 241.1 mg potassium (7%). As for western fish cakes or fish patties, there is no significant difference in the nutritional aspects with their Asian counterparts. However, the western fish cakes are relatively in higher fat content. Western fish cakes or patties have approximately 201 Calories per 100g, contributed by 12.38g carbohydrate (4%) (including 1.1g dietary fiber and 1.03g sugar), 13.65g protein, 10.49g fat (16%*) (including saturated fat 2.245g, polyunsaturated fat 3.085g and monounsaturated fat 4.418g), 55 mg cholesterol (22%), 279 mg sodium (14%), and 463 mg potassium. The percentage daily values above are based on a 2000 Calories diet so may vary depending on the caloric needs of the consumer.  Common dishes  Fish cakes are cooked in different manners based on the cuisine. In North America, it is common practice to pan-fry the fish cakes and are often served as appetizers whereas in Asia it is often served boiled in soups or as an accompaniment to noodles. Some common dishes in Asian countries that include fish cakes are udon, fish cake soup, fish ball noodles or just served individually as a side dish.  Manufacturing  When it comes to manufacturing fishcakes, according to Singaporean fishcake production, fish meats are first defrosted and then ground. After the grinding process, fish meats and all ingredients needed are blended together at high speed. Normally, salt, sugar, flour, and starch are necessarily added to mashed fish fillets. It is good to add salt which approximately weighs 3% of the fish fillets' weight. Also, other ingredients such as vegetables (onions, carrots, or green onions) or chemicals such as MSG can be added for a better flavor only if the ingredients are suitable for the local requirement. Next, the fish paste is formed so that it can be baked or deep-fried. In order to properly preserve fishcake product, during the process of baking or frying, eradication of enzymes and microorganisms is necessary using heat. For instance, Canada has a specific regulation that the fish cakes should be heated to for one minute to destroy the salmonella that may be present. After fishcakes are finally filtered, it is sent for packing and it is now ready to deliver.  Distribution and storage  Fishcakes are also often sold in fish markets in individual pieces. To keep the fish cakes fresh they are often sold in bags full of water. These fish cakes are not fried and usually used in soups. The shelf life for fish cakes varies greatly depending on the manufacturing and storage process. The shelf life can range from 12 days to 90 days.

It is situated on the N11 in Dublin. History The school was opened in 1941. The Bishop asked Mother Pauline Dunne, Superior General of Loreto, to open a junior and secondary school in Foxrock. The Sisters arrived in the house on September 8, 1941. \\"School began two days later. The pupil numbers were in single digits for the first few weeks, but had grown to 28 by the following spring.\\"http://loretofoxrock.ie/about-us/history Work on the construction of the chapel (now the staff room) began in January 1942. The early years were impacted by World War II, and conditions were difficult. When the architect for the chapel sought the iron girders needed for the construction, it was found that none could be sourced. He solved the problem by supporting the roof by two rows of pillars, which were considered to add to the dignity of the building. In September 1942, the school was officially recognised as a secondary school by the Department of Education. The kindergarten / junior school block was completed and occupied by Christmas 1942, and by May 1943, there were 50 pupils in the schools. In that year, sports began to play an important part in the curriculum of Loreto Foxrock. However, the annals record that wartime travelling conditions prevented participation in the inter-Loreto sports competitions; so friendly matches were arranged between the local schools. In 1952, the Junior Hockey Cup was the first trophy won by the school, under the captaincy of Chela Neary. The Annals record many sporting triumphs and trophies over the following years. In the school year 1953–1954, plans were drawn up for the construction of the concert hall and the science room to the front of the building. The building now known as St. Michaels was originally built in 1966. The annals of the school include many anecdotes about the earliest pupils, who are included by name. A number of these pupils died at very young ages from illnesses, which would now be treated successfully, given advances in medical science. One such pupil was Olga Hick, who appears in the records as the very first pupil to arrive in the new Loreto School in Foxrock. The first member of the community to die was the well-loved Mother Imelda McInerney who had been in charge of the kindergarten from its opening until her death in 1956 at the age of 37. Many past pupils still recall her care for them and her wonderful sense of humour. Buildings and facilities The buildings on campus house the community residence, the secondary school and the Loreto Education office. The school buildings have been erected on a phased basis in response to educational needs and student population. In the 1980s, with the help of a partial grant from the Department of Education, the old prefabricated building was updated and became known as “St. Michael’s”. Following a Loreto Community contribution and fund-raising, the sports hall was added in the late 1980s. In 1999, the trustees gave the community chapel to the secondary School for development as a staff room. In response to the increasing student population in the secondary school, the trustees also agreed to give the junior school and kindergarten classrooms for use in the secondary school. In 2000, a large extension was added to the lunchroom and recreation area. Two additional classrooms and a new fire stairs were also part of this development. A new computer room was also completed. The grounds include a floodlit astroturf hockey pitch, astroturf tennis/basketball courts and a grass play area. Bicycle and car parking areas were expanded. Operations and funding The school is a fee-paying secondary day school, and is run by the Board of Management, which was first set up in 1990. It now has an enrollment of 684 students and provides the Transition Year option. The current principal is Bernie Prendiville after taking over from Ms. Mannion.

It was licensed to Sega in Japan. In Armor Attack, the player controls a jeep in an overhead, maze-like view of a town. The buildings are not drawn in the game, but are an overlay that sits on top of the monitor. The overlay also tints the vectors green. Armor Attack was released for the Vectrex in 1982. Gameplay The visuals are stark without the monitor overlay. The jeep is armed with a rocket launcher that fires straight forward; the player can have two rockets on- screen at the time. The driving is similar to Combat for the Atari 2600 and the Asteroids arcade game where one button rotates the jeep clockwise, while a second button rotates the jeep counterclockwise. A third button simulates the gas pedal to move forward while a fourth button is used for firing. Tanks periodically spawn from different locations on the edge of the screen and drive towards the player. The tanks always travel along horizontal or vertical lines, unlike the freely moving jeep. Tank turrets move to track the player, allowing them to shoot in any direction. Tanks normally take two hits to kill, and the player can have only two rockets on the screen at a time. The helicopter spawns from any point, and approaches the player in looping paths flying over the jeep and periodically firing. If hit, the helicopter spirals in. Destroying the helicopter rewards the player with an extra life. The player can be killed by being shot by either the tanks of helicopter, or by colliding with the tanks. In two-player mode, the players can not kill each other. Gameplay periodically speeds up to increase the difficulty. Reception David H. Ahl of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games praised the \\"amazing realism\\" of the enemy helicopter in the Vectrex version.

His prestige was somewhat marred in later life when he agreed to run as the only major candidate opposing Ferdinand Marcos in the widely fraudulent 1981 Philippine presidential election. Early life and public service Imprenta Press (1860) V John Sherwin (Casa Real Shrine-Museum, Malolos City) printing machine used by the First Philippine Republic (now the Case Real Shrine), where the newspapers La Independencia, El Heraldo de la Revolucion, Kalayaan, and Kaibingan ng Bayan were printed. During the Japanese occupation, the \\"Bulacan Military Area\\", under Capt. Alejo Santos, used this machine, against the Japanese. Santos was born in Brgy. Bonga Menor, Bustos, Bulacan, to farmer Pedro de los Santos y de la Cruz and Regina de los Santos y Francisco. He graduated from the University of the Philippines with an education degree. He first served as Prison Guard with the Bureau of Prisons from 1933 to 1934. Santos married Juanita Garcia of Baliuag, Bulacan in 1934 and they had eight children: Reynaldo, Edgardo, Ravenal, Lamberto, Alexis, Liberty, Daisy, and Nenita. At the outbreak of World War II, he was a captain of the USAFFE. He was among the USAFFE soldiers who retreated to Bataan to make the last stand against the invading Imperial Japanese Army. However, he evaded capture by the Japanese when Bataan fell, escaping instead to his hometown. Santos then agreed to join the fledgling anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare movement under Bernard L. Anderson.Lapham, R., and Norling, B., 1996, Lapham's Raiders, Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, He became one of the founders of the Bulacan Military Area, the main guerrilla movement in Bulacan which had 23,000 men under its command. The BMA attracted many patriotic Filipinos chafing under Japanese rule, and was soon organized into eight divisions. For his World War II activities, Santos received numerous citations and awards from the Philippine and American governments. He was the only Filipino conferred the rank of Brigadier General by the American Government. Political career After the liberation of Bulacan by joint Filipino and American ground troops in 1945, Santos was named as its military governor. He was elected as to the House of Representatives in 1946, representing the 2nd District of Bulacan under the banner of the leftist Democratic Alliance, but was almost immediately unseated together with several of his party-mates in a controversial maneuver believed to be related with the looming congressional vote on the approval of the Bell Trade Act with the United States. Nonetheless, Santos was again elected to the House in 1949, and he served in the 2nd Congress until his election as governor of Bulacan in 1951. By then, Santos had affiliated with the Nacionalista Party. Santos would serve as governor until 1957, wherein 705 public works projects were constructed in Bulacan and the national government released Php 1.9 Million for these. From 1959 to 1961, Santos served as Secretary of National Defense in the cabinet of President Carlos P. Garcia. In 1967 he was appointed by President Marcos to head the prison bureau, a post he held until 1971. Presidential candidacy By 1981, Santos had mostly retired from political life, devoting his activity to veterans affairs; thus, it came as a surprise when he agreed to run for President against Ferdinand Marcos in the 1981 elections. The elections were called shortly after Marcos lifted the nine- year-old declaration of martial law while retaining authoritarian powers at the same time, and were seen as a means of maintaining the veneer of democracy, especially in the international community. However, the anti-Marcos political opposition, which felt it was cheated out of victory in the 1978 parliamentary elections, refused to participate in the presidential elections and successfully called for a boycott. Santos' candidacy, ostensibly under the banner of the then-moribund Nacionalista Party, provided Marcos with at least one other \\"major\\" candidate he could run against. Santos, though the sole widely known opponent of Marcos, did not offer a vigorous campaign, and he was trounced in the election, garnering only 8% of the vote as against Marcos's 88%. Death Gravesite of Santos and his wife Juanita. Santos died just three years after his presidential candidacy and was buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. Later on, his remains were transferred into a memorial park in his hometown in Bulacan. A camp of the Philippine National Police in Bulacan is named after Santos. Notes :1.Alejo Santos was thirty-five days old when he was baptized on August 20, 1911, making July 17, 1911 as his date of birth.

The Dungs gained some degree of prominence in the American underground punk scene based on sporadic concerts around the middle U.S., including Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia. =Beginnings= Brandon Tussey met Wayne Griffith at a record store where Wayne worked. They had a similar taste in music and Brandon eventually asked Wayne if he wanted to start a band. Wayne got his brother, Chris Griffith, to play drums, and coworker, John Spears, to play guitar. A few months into 1994, the Connie Dungs began performing at local shows in Eastern Kentucky. During this early period they recorded and released two cassette-tape demos (Songs for Swinging Lovers and Nice Guys Finish Last), which were sold exclusively at shows. Both Songs for Swinging Lovers and Nice Guys Finish Last were later collected on one album, Songs for Swinging Nice Guys, released in 1999 on Mutant Pop Records.http://www.mutantpop.com/ Their first official release was a split 7\\" with fellow local punk band Tugboat.

It serves as a regional accrediting association, working independently of and in conjunction with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The SAIS is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools. SAIS-SACS Accreditation History SAIS has been offering a dual accreditation since 1953. In 2004, SAIS began offering a dual accreditation with SACS, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Later SAIS has been working with SACS to develop standards and self-study processes more useful for independent schools. The participating school must meet the standards listed in the Guidebook for SAIS-SACS Accreditation. SAIS- SACS accreditation is contingent upon the school meeting all standards by responding in writing to each indicator. When evidence of an indicator is not shown, the school must explain how the standard is met in the absence of the indicator. The chair and visiting team report to the SAIS Accreditation Committee if the school has met the standards and performed a thorough and adequate self-study. The SAIS Accreditation Committee has final approval of whether or not the school meets the standards and is accredited. Schools participating in the SAIS-SACS process communicate and work with SAIS in preparation for the accreditation cycle. Schools do not work with their respective state SACS committees regarding SAIS-SACS Accreditation.

Biography  Lamond was born in Burrelton, Perthshire. His father worked for the London and North Eastern Railway. He was educated at schools in Burrelton and Coupar Angus, before becoming an apprentice draughtsman at the Hall and Company shipyard in Aberdeen in 1942, aged 14. He could not afford the fees to study naval architecture in Newcastle, and worked as a draughtsman for the North-east Scotland Regional Hospital Board. He was an active member of the Draughtsmen's and Allied Technicians' Association (Data; later successively renamed as AUEW-Tass, MSF, Amicus and Unite). He joined the Labour party in 1950, and was elected to Aberdeen City Council in 1959, serving as a councillor until 1971. He became leader of the local Labour group in 1967, and served as Lord Provost and Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeen in 1970–71. After he failed to be selected for the safe Labour seat of Aberdeen North, losing out to Robert Hughes, he found favour instead in Oldham East, where he was elected in June 1970. He was on the left-wing of the Labour party, alongside Tony Benn and Eric Heffer. He opposed the plans for devolution in Scotland, voting against the Scotland Bill in 1977. Also in 1977, he was upbraided by the Speaker after making some forthright remarks about Prince Philip. Lamond supported Tony Benn in his unsuccessful bid to become the Labour party's deputy leader in 1980. He was a vice-president of the World Peace Council, president of the British Peace Assembly, founder chairman of the British-East German Society. In the 1980s, he was criticised as an apologist of the Communist regime in the Soviet Union, particularly after he provided justifications for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In a debate in the House of Commons in July 1980, the World Peace Council was criticised by Conservative Foreign Office minister Peter Blaker as a \\"disguised instrument of Soviet policy\\", a charge that Lamond rejected (although he later accepted that much of its funding did indeed come from the Soviet Union). After constituency boundaries were redrawn for the 1983 election, he moved to the new seat of Oldham Central and Royton, selected ahead of Joel Barnett. He opposed the location of US cruise missiles and Pershing missiles in the UK in December 1983. He supported the declining textile industry in his constituency. He served on the Public Accounts Committee from 1975 to 1983, and served on the Speaker's panel from 1979 until he retired at the 1992 general election.  Local politics again  Lamond returned to local politics after leaving Parliament, serving as a member of Grampian Regional Council from 1994 to 1996. He became a Deputy Lieutenant of Aberdeen in 1995. He rejoined Aberdeen City Council in 1995, serving alongside his wife, before both retired in May 2007.North of Scotland - Aberdeen News - Press and Journal He was chairman of the Royal Aberdeen Workshops for the Blind and Disabled from 2002 to 2004. With his wife June Wellburn in 1954, Lamond had three daughters, all of whom survived him. He suffered from pneumonia in later life.

As the name suggests, it is the sequel to the 1985 arcade game Alpha Mission. It was later released for the Neo Geo CD in 1994 and for the PlayStation Portable in 2010. The player controls a fighter spacecraft (Armored Scrum Object) and can shoot enemies in the air, bomb enemies on the ground, collect power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot showcasing the first boss. The game controls uses 2 or 3 buttons used depending on the selected shuttle mode. The ship's armaments consist of air-to-air laser shots, air-to-ground missiles and any Power Weapons the player collects. The laser and missiles can be upgraded up to four times by collecting the powerups from drones that are shot. Power Weapons are available after the player collects three pieces of the same armour type or can be bought with credits acquired after each stage.Alpha Mission II user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) The weapons have limited power indicated on an energy meter. Using the weapons or getting the ship damaged lowers the energy. The energy can be recharged by collecting E power ups. Once the energy expires, the ship returns to normal mode. Depending on which mode is selected varies whether Button C or B activates the Power Weapons. Various hidden items can do certain things like an R item can put the shuttle in Reverse for a certain distance. The shuttle is destroyed by one shot or by running into an enemy unit or hazard. Unless the player collects enough K power-ups beforehand, the missiles and laser shots will be lost to minimum power when the player loses a life. There are seven stages in the game, with the last one consisting of a single boss battle. The player has to fight through them avoiding hazards in addition. Mid-bosses very occasionally appear in the game. When the player meets a mid-boss or end stage boss, the player must destroy weak points and various parts of the boss to destroy it.  Development and release   Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Alpha Mission II on their May 1, 1991 issue as being the most- successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. Since its initial release in arcades, the game has been met with generally positive reception from critics. Series *1. Alpha Mission (1985) *2.

It is a tributary of the Saco River, which flows to the Atlantic Ocean in Maine. The Ellis River rises on the eastern slopes of Mount Washington, the highest peak in the northeastern United States. Flowing south, it is quickly joined by the Cutler River flowing out of Tuckerman and Huntington ravines, passes over Crystal Cascade, and reaches the floor of Pinkham Notch. The river leaves the level ground at the high point of the notch by dropping over Glen Ellis Falls. The falls are a short walk from Route 16, the highway through the notch. A U.S. Forest Service parking area, not far from the top of the falls, gives access to a well-maintained, hard-surfaced, short trail hugging the river to a point at the top of the falls, where there is a lookout nearly straight down into the gorge, and then the trail proceeds by a steep descent of stairs to the deep pool at the base of the falls. The river continues south into the town of Jackson, New Hampshire, through a gradually widening valley, where it is joined by Wildcat Brook. Leaving the small intervale at Jackson village, the Ellis River drops over a hydroelectric dam at Goodrich Falls and reaches the Saco River near the village of Glen in the town of Bartlett.

Typically, these highly competitive undergraduate programs are overseen by a member of a college's faculty, who provide general guidance to the undergraduate's research work. Areas of research vary widely, and can come from any art or science discipline. Often, SURF participants are given a stipend to cover living expenses for the duration of the project. SURF projects are also, more often than not, used for college credit, though this will vary according to the institution. Many colleges give students the option to carry out a one or two semester senior research project, also under the SURF banner. Majors in a department follow a core of course requirements intended to gradually introduce students to the research process. By following this core, undergraduates reach their senior year adequately prepared for meaningful, independent research. A distinctive element of many SURF experiences is that the project results in a written thesis defended before a faculty panel in the presence of the department and students.

He was born Karl Hugo Weizsäcker in Stuttgart, the son of the theologian Karl Heinrich Weizsäcker and his wife, the former Auguste Sophie Christiane Dahm. While serving as a politician at the court of the Kingdom of Württemberg, his family was raised to nobility as von Weizsäcker. Weizsäcker studied at the University of Tübingen. While serving in the administration of King William II of Württemberg, he was raised to personal nobility on 24 February 1897. From 1900 onwards, he served as Minister of Culture — until 4 December 1906 when he was made Prime Minister. He served in this office until 6 November 1918, shortly before the monarchy was abolished.

Fletch Lives was released by Universal Pictures. Plot Fletch, a reporter in Los Angeles for the Los Angeles Times, is contacted by the executor of his late aunt's will, attorney Amanda Ray Ross. Ross informs Fletch he has inherited his aunt's 80-acre plantation, Belle Isle, in Thibodaux, Louisiana. Upon arriving, Fletch is disappointed to find the mansion terribly dilapidated, but he agrees to keep on its caretaker, Calculus Entropy. Fletch has dinner with Ross at her home, and she tells him of an anonymous $225,000 bid for Belle Isle. Fletch awakens the next morning to find Ross dead. Fletch is charged with Ross' murder and taken into custody, nearly being raped by his cellmate Ben Dover, spared only because Dover is released on bail. Dover's lawyer Hamilton \\"Ham\\" Johnson manages to get Fletch released. When Fletch declines a second, even larger offer of $250,000 for Belle Isle, this time presented by realtor Becky Culpepper, he starts getting harassed. First, a hired group of Ku Klux Klansmen harasses him. Then, an arsonist burns down the mansion. Finally, Ben Dover tries to kill Fletch during a raccoon hunt with some locals. Fletch discovers the land on Belle Isle is polluted by toxic waste. He determines to uncover the identity of the anonymous buyer, whom he suspects is attempting to intimidate him into selling. He learns the local megachurch, Farnsworth Ministries, is interested in obtaining the Belle Isle property. Fletch investigates televangelist Jimmy Lee Farnsworth, and discovers Farnsworth's daughter is Becky Culpepper. The toxic chemicals in the soil of Belle Isle are traced back to Bly Bio, a chemical waste facility in Mississippi. Fletch obtains an invoice from the plant's manager, which proves that Ham Johnson ordered the waste dumped on the Belle Isle land. Fletch confronts Ham with the evidence at a costume party fundraiser hosted by Ham at his home. Ham admits he polluted Belle Isle out of revenge for the way he feels Farnsworth took advantage of Ham's mother shortly before she died. Farnsworth persuaded her in her confused mental state to give away her valuable land, on which the church then built a profitable amusement park. Ham intended to devalue the land owned by Farnsworth Ministries. He killed Ross when she realized his plan. Becky is captured by Dover and brought to Ham's mansion, and Ham orders Dover to kill Fletch and her. Fletch creates a distraction by spilling out the urn containing Ham's mother's ashes, and Becky and he escape. They flee to the Farnsworth Ministries church nearby, interrupting a televised service in progress. Ham follows them, intending to kill Fletch, but Ham is shot by Calculus. Afterwards, Calculus reveals himself to be FBI Special Agent Goldstein working undercover as part of an investigation of Farnsworth Ministries' financial dealings. Returning to Los Angeles with Becky, Fletch is thrown a welcome home party by his co-workers and receives a $100,000 insurance claim check for the mansion fire. His ex-wife's alimony lawyer, Melvyn Gillette, appears, offering to forego all future alimony payments in exchange for the Belle Isle property. Fletch happily signs over the polluted land.

Methods are available to make it more degradable under certain conditions of sunlight, moisture, oxygen, and composting and enhancement of biodegradation by reducing the hydrophobic polymer and increasing hydrophilic properties. If traditional polyethylene film is littered it can be unsightly, and a hazard to wildlife. Some people believe that making plastic shopping bags biodegradable is one way to try to allow the open litter to degrade. Plastic recycling improves usage of resources. Biodegradable films need to be kept away from the usual recycling stream to prevent contaminating the polymers to be recycled. If disposed of in a sanitary landfill, most traditional plastics do not readily decompose. The sterile conditions of a sealed landfill also deter degradation of biodegradable polymers. Polyethylene is a polymer consisting of long chains of the monomer ethylene (IUPAC name ethene). The recommended scientific name polyethene is systematically derived from the scientific name of the monomer.[1] [2] In certain circumstances it is useful to use a structure–based nomenclature. In such cases IUPAC recommends poly(methylene).[2] The difference is due to the opening up of the monomer's double bond upon polymerisation. In the polymer industry the name is sometimes shortened to PE in a manner similar to that by which other polymers like polypropylene and polystyrene are shortened to PP and PS respectively. In the United Kingdom the polymer is commonly called polythene, although this is not recognised scientifically. The ethene molecule (known almost universally by its common name ethylene) C2H4 is CH2=CH2, Two CH2 groups connected by a double bond, thus: Polyethylene is created through polymerization of ethene. It can be produced through radical polymerization, anionic addition polymerization, ion coordination polymerization or cationic addition polymerization. This is because ethene does not have any substituent groups that influence the stability of the propagation head of the polymer. Each of these methods results in a different type of polyethylene.  Types of biodegradable polythene film  Polythene or polyethylene film will naturally fragment and biodegrade, but it can take many decades to do this. There are two methods to resolve this problem. One is to modify the carbon chain of polyethylene with an additive to improve its degradability and then its biodegradability; the other is to make a film with similar properties to polyethylene from a biodegradable substance such as starch. The latter are however much more expensive. = Starch based or biobased (hydrodegradable) film = This type is made from corn (maize), potatoes or wheat. This form of biodegradable film meets the ASTM standard (American Standard for Testing Materials) and European Norm EN13432 for compostability as it degrades at least 90% within 90 days or less at 140 degrees F. However, actual products made with this type of film may not meet those standards.  Examples of polymers made from starch  * Polycaprolactone (PCL) * Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) * Polylactic acid (PLA) The heat, moisture and aeration in an industrial composting plant are required for this type of film to biodegrade, so it will not therefore readily degrade if littered in the environment.  Pros & cons of starch based film/bag  = Pros = * It is \\"compostable\\" under industrial conditions. * Reduced fossil fuel content (depending on loading of filler.) = Cons = * Is more expensive than its non-biodegradable counterpart * Source of starch can be problematic (competition against food use, rainforests being cleared to grow crops for bioplastics) * Fossil fuels are burned and CO2 produced in the agricultural production process. * Poorer mechanical strength than additive based example – filling a starch bag with wet leaves and placing it curbside can result in the bottom falling out when a haulier picks it up. * Often not strong enough for use in high-speed machines * Degradation in a sealed landfill takes at least 6 months. * Emits CO2 in aerobic conditions and methane under anaerobic conditions * Limited Shelf life. Conditions must be respected for stockage. * If mixed with other plastics for recycling, the recycling process is compromised.  Typical applications  Carrier bag, refusal sacks, vegetable bags, food films, agricultural films, mailing films. However, these applications are still very limited compared to those of petroleum based plastic films.  Additive based  Additives can be added to conventional polymers to make them either oxodegradable or more hydrophilic to facilitate microbial attack. = Oxodegradable = These films are made by incorporating an additive within normal polymers to provide an oxidative and then a biological mechanism to degrade them. This typically takes 6 months to 1 year in the environment with adequate exposure to oxygen Degradation is a two-stage process; first the plastic is converted by reaction with oxygen (light, heat and/or stress accelerates the process but is not essential) to hydrophilic low molecular- weight materials and then these smaller oxidized molecules are biodegraded, i.e. converted into carbon dioxide, water and biomass by naturally occurring microorganisms. Commercial competitors and their trade associations allege that the process of biodegradation stops at a certain point, leaving fragments, but they have never established why or at what point. In fact Oxo- biodegradation of polymer material has been studied in depth at the Technical Research Institute of Sweden and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. A peer-reviewed report of the work was published in Vol 96 of the journal of Polymer Degradation & Stability (2011) at page 919-928. It shows 91% biodegradation in a soil environment within 24 months, when tested in accordance with ISO 17556. This is similar to the breakdown of woody plant material where lignin is broken down and forms a humus component improving the soil quality. There is however a lot of controversy about these types of bags. The complete biodegradation is disputed and claimed not to take place. Many countries are now also thinking to ban this type of bags altogether = Enhancing hydrophilicity of the polymer = These films are inherently biodegradable over a long period of time. Enhancement of the polymer by adding in additives to change the hydrophobic nature of the resin to slightly hydrophilic allows microorganisms to consume the macromolecules of the product, these products often are confused with oxobiodegradable products, but work in a different way. Enhancing of the hydrophilicity of the polymer allows fungus and bacteria to consume the polymer at a faster rate utilizing the carbon inside the polymer chain for energy. These additives attract certain microorganisms found in nature and many tests have been completed on the mixing of synthetic and biobased materials which are inherently biodegradable for enhancing the biodegradability of synthetic polymers that are not as fast to biodegrade.  Pros and cons of additive based film/bag  = Pros = * Much cheaper than starch-based plastics * Can be made with normal machinery, and can be used in high speed machines, so no need to change suppliers and no loss of jobs * Materials are well known * Does not compete against food production * These films look, act and perform just like their non-degradable counterparts, during their programmed service-life but then break down if discarded. * They can be recycled with normal plastics. * They are certified non-toxic, and safe for food-contact * Some bags degrade at about the same rate as a leaf. In fact, when used as bin liners, bags can start degrading after three or four days of being in the bin. = Cons = * Degradation depends on access to air * Not designed to degrade in landfill, but can be safely landfilled. Will degrade if oxygen is present, but will NOT emit methane in landfill * European or American (EN13432 D6400)Standards on compostable products are not appropriate, as not designed for composting. They should be tested according to ASTM D6954 or (as from 1 Jan 1010) UAE norm 5009:2009 * They are not suitable for PET or PVC * Precise rate of degradation/biodegradation cannot be predicted, but will be faster than nature's wastes such as straw or twigs, and much faster than normal plastic * Like normal plastics they are made from a by-product of oil or natural gas * If mixed with other plastics for recycling, the recycling process is compromised.  Typical applications  Trash Bags, Garbage Bags, Compost Bags, Carrier bag, Agricultural Film, Mulch Film, produce bags, - in fact all forms of short-life plastic film packaging  See also  * Biodegradable plastic * Bioplastic * Plastic bag * Plastic recycling * Packaging * Photodegradation  References  * BBC News: \\"All Tesco bags 'to be degradable\\" 10 May 2006 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4758419.stm * BBC News: \\"Degradable carrier bags launched\\" 2 September 2002 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2229698.stm * Yam, K.

Mr zahedi was approved by Iran's parliament with the fewest supporting votes possible (supporters had only one vote more than opponents). He was elected as a Member of the Parliament in 2012 election. He was reelected in 2016. On 1 January 2017, he was announced that he would run for presidency in 2017 presidential election. His nomination was rejected by the Guardian Council. Academia Zahedi received his PhD in Mathematics from Kerman University where he is currently a \\"full professor\\". He is the first graduate of a PhD in mathematics in Iran.. Zahedi has 15 scientific articles in ISI with very few citations (most of them self citations). He repeatedly called himself \\"one of the greatest mathematicians of the time\\". With such a minor scientific achievement he was promoted to full professorship in 1999 (when he had only published 11 articles). Zahedi's profile claims he is a member of New York Academy of Sciences. An investigation by BBC Persian in July 2009 debunked this claim. His profile also claims that he was named among the most prominent Mathematicians of the century by American Mathematical Society for which there is no evidence found on American Mathematical Society website.  Expulsion of university scientists In 2006, the Ahmadinejad government systematically forced numerous Iranian scientists and University professors to resign or to retire. It has been referred to as a second cultural revolution. The policy has been said to replace current professors with younger ones. Many University professors received letters indicating their early retirement unexpectedly. However many believe that the government's main goal is to replace Iranian scientists with fundamentalists and finally convert the universities into Hawza (traditional religious schools). Despite huge demonstrations and protests of Iranian students, Zahedi appointed several mullahs with no academic degrees as chancellors of several Universities (the most prominent example being that of Tehran University).  Expelling the politically active students  Zahedi has expelled dozens of politically active students and those who were working in internal newspaper of university by refusing to enroll them for the new academic year (Fall 2006). He first denied the existence of such students but recently he said that those students had criminal cases such as robbery and sexual harassment. This made the students very angry and they asked the MPs for his impeachment.  Ignoring scientific merit in appointments  Zahedi's appointments and dismissals at the Science, Research and Technology Ministry were not based on merit. University chancellors had been formerly appointed after consulting university professors. However, the situation changed as Zahedi become Iran's minister of science and the criterion of meritocracy has been ignored. Zahedi appointed Abbasali Amid Zanjani, a cleric with no academic degree, as the chancellor of Tehran University.

China According to the legend, Emperor Shun's minister Gao Yao had a mythical, goat-like creature called the zhi (廌) which he used in criminal proceedings whenever he was in doubt. The animal instinctively knew the innocent from the guilty; it butted the latter with its single horn.Jeannie Thomas Parker, The Mythic Chinese Unicorn, http://chinese- unicorn.com/ch01/ Mentions of the xiezhi in Chinese literature can be traced back to the Han Dynasty where it is described by the scholar Yang Fu as a \\"righteous beast, which rams the wrongful party when it sees a fight and bites the wrongful party when it hears an argument\\". It is described in the Shuowen Jiezi as being \\"a cattle-like beast with one horn; in ancient times. It settled disputes by ramming the party at fault\\". As an inherently just beast, the xiezhi was used as a symbol of justice and law. The Censorate of the Ming and Qing eras, who were responsible for the monitoring of the civil service, wore the xiezhi as a badge of office. Similarly, military policemen of the Republic of China wear badges bearing the xiezhi and it is engraved on the gavels in the law courts of the People's Republic of China. Japan In Japan, it is known as kaichi (獬豸), also sometimes referred to as a shin'yō (神羊 \\"divine sheep\\"). It is similar to a lion with one horn on the top of its head.

Since inception in 1987, CANFAR has invested more than $21 million in research initiatives across Canada, and supported more than 400 distinct research initiatives. CANFAR is funded solely through the generosity of corporations, groups, and individuals across Canada. Each year it is the responsibility of CANFAR's Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) to evaluate which research proposals seem most promising and likely to make a worthwhile contribution to the international body of HIV and AIDS research. CANFAR is dedicated to funding all aspects of research, including: fundamental and applied research; educational and prevention; care; psychosocial initiatives; and, community research. __TOC__ History CANFAR was created in 1987 by four friends (Dinah Koo, Van Beltreme, Jack Creed and Robert Mang) in an effort to support HIV/AIDS research that would lead to a cure since Canada's emerging HIV/AIDS organizations primarily dealt with the, just as significant, need to care and support people living with the disease. Canada has not faced a great number of AIDS cases in comparison to its neighbour country, the United States. Three doctors and scientists, Dr. Mary Fanning, Dr. Michael Baker and Dr. Norbert Gilmore were brought on board to scientifically determine which research projects were most promising and deserving of funding. CANFAR was incorporated in 1987. Cornelia Molson was Founding President and Robert Ross became the charity's founding Executive Director. In 1988, CANFAR held the first Food for Thought gala dinner, raising over $150,000 for HIV/AIDS research. This event has grown and changed over the years, but is an integral part of CANFAR's fundraising efforts. Prominent philanthropist Bluma Appel joined CANFAR's Planning Committee, later becoming a creator of a Board of Advisors and a Junior Committee, as well as acting as Chair of the Executive Committee until her death in 2007. In 1989, the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) was organized to identify the most promising HIV/AIDS research projects and providing them funding. Dr. Gilmore headed up this group and in 1989, CANFAR announced its first seventeen grant recipients. That year, CANFAR gave $184,445 to HIV/AIDS research projects across Canada. CANFAR continued to grow its funding capabilities with its Outreach to Industries campaign, securing the support of both the banking and insurance industries. The new support enabled CANFAR to grant its first Canadian Industry Research Award (CIRA) to Dr. Tak Mak in the amount of $100,000. With to the renewed support of major supporters, CANFAR awarded a second CIRA to Dr. Frank Plummer in 1994. Research =Funding Research= CANFAR supports research in four main areas of study; basic science, epidemiology, clinical studies, and psycho-social studies. Grants are awarded in two categories; one-year grants up to $25,000 and under or two-year grants up to $80,000 per year. A peer-review process determines which studies are funded. Each proposal is reviewed and graded by at least three other scholars in the HIV/AIDS field. Proposals are judged on scientific merit; relevance of the research; the qualifications, experience and productivity of the researcher; the uniqueness of the project within the Canadian and global context; and the facilities available to undertake the proposed research. Once graded, the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) decides which studies deserve funding. The SAC uses the grades and comments of the reviewers along with their own knowledge of the studies to make their decisions. The proposals are then ranked with a cut off point beyond which the SAC does not recommend funding. From there the Board of Directors meets to approve the SAC selections as to which proposals will be funded based on the rankings by the SAC and the funds available. Since 1987 CANFAR has reviewed close to over 1000 proposals, funded well over three hundred studies across ten provinces, and directed over $15 million towards HIV/AIDS research. Within the HIV/AIDS funding landscape in Canada, there are currently only three organizations devoted to research and two of those are funded by the federal and provincial levels of government respectively. As well as CANFAR there is the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Ontario HIV/AIDS Treatment Network (OHTN). Over the course of its history, CANFAR has worked towards increasing the amount and number of the grants that it supports. In its first year CANFAR awarded five grants totalling almost $60,000. CANFAR now consistently funds more than fifteen research studies and collaborations exceeding $750,000. =CANFAR- funded Breakthroughs= Dr. Sadhna Joshi and research team Dr. Sadhna Joshi at the University of Toronto is working to discover ways to combat HIV through gene therapy. In her research, Dr. Joshi targets both the cells that are infected by HIV, and the virus itself. Dr. Joshi is experimenting with ways to prevent infection by removing receptors that HIV uses to enter immune cells. She is also targeting genes in HIV to prevent replication after infection. Dr. Clifford Lingwood from The Hospital for Sick Children and Dr. Donald Branch from Canadian Blood Services have identified a new resistance factor in the battle against HIV. They discovered that immune cells from individuals who have a certain rare blood type called blood group antigen Pk, also have a drastically reduced sensitivity to HIV infection. This factor protects cells from infection, indicating that it may have therapeutic potential. Dr. Deborah Money's research at the Children's and Women's Health Centre of British Columbia has provided new insights to guide the safe use of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Dr. Money studies the risks of toxicity and health outcomes in both mothers and uninfected children following antiretroviral therapy. Dr. Frank Plummer from the University of Manitoba is studying a small group of Nairobi prostitutes to discover the source of their natural resistance to HIV infection. He has discovered that HIV resistant women have higher levels of a protein called elafin/trappin-2 that helps to confer immunity. Dr. Plummer was named Canada's Health Researcher of the Year in 2007 for his work on HIV/AIDS. Dr. Mark Wainberg, was a CANFAR funded researcher and Director of the McGill University AIDS Centre, who discovered a critical component in the highly effective \\"AIDS cocktail\\". This major breakthrough led to a dramatic fall in AIDS deaths and has improved the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS since the mid-1990s. Dr. Wainberg continued to make discoveries at the forefront of HIV/AIDS research with a focus on anti-viral drugs, understanding drug resistance, and gene therapy - until his death in 2017. For his seminal contributions in the field, Dr. Wainberg was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and a Chevalier de Légion d'honneur - the highest honours of Canada and France. Events Bloor Street Entertains guests dining at Ferrari Maserati =Bloor Street Entertains= On September 29, 1988 CANFAR hosted the first Food for Thought, and raised more than $150,000 to support HIV and AIDS research. In 1993, Food for Thought was renamed the World AIDS Day Gala and moved from the fall to coincide with World AIDS Day on December 1. In 1997 the event was renamed Bloor Street Entertains. The annual event now raises more than $800,000 each year, and is CANFAR's largest fundraising vehicle. =AIDSbeat= In 1994, Patricia Olasker organized a CANFAR fundraising event for lawyers which featured breakfast and amateur bands. Officially named AIDSbeat in 1996, the event raised $20,000 for HIV/AIDS research. As of 2008, attendance exceeds 800 people each year and raises over $200,000 for CANFAR and HIV/AIDS research. Campaigns =Have a Heart for CANFAR= Have a Heart logo In 1993, Have a Heart for CANFAR was organized at Northern Secondary School in Toronto. Students sold candy-grams of cinnamon hearts with red ribbons to each other near Valentine's Day. Approximately $560 was raised through this awareness initiative. Now called Heart-o-grams, these packages include gum, a red ribbon, HIV/AIDS awareness pamphlets, and optional condoms. In 2011, the Have a Heart campaign was run in over 1,600 schools across Canada with more than 1 million students participating. Each year CANFAR gives out The Heart Award which is presented annually to the high school that demonstrates outstanding dedication and community spirit while raising research funds and HIV/AIDS awareness among their peers. In 2006, CANFAR introduced the first annual Have a Heart Scholarship Program to recognize Have a Heart participants who have made a difference in raising awareness in their school community. Each year a $500 scholarship is awarded to a deserving student who has displayed outstanding leadership in running a successful Have a Heart campaign and demonstrated dedication to the fight against HIV/AIDS. CANFAR has partnered with the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) to create the awareness posters that are displayed in the schools. Those posters then form the basis for the awareness materials that are sent to the schools the following year. CANFAR Clubs CANFAR Clubs are groups of students across Canada that have joined forces on college and university campuses to raise awareness about the virus and to raise funds for research. Annually, these student leaders organize parties, hold informative focus groups, and panel discussions to address the issue of AIDS, both within their demographic and internationally. The first CANFAR Club was initiated at McGill University in 2003. At McGill, Catherine Pringle and a friend decided to throw a party to spread AIDS awareness on campus called Affair en Rouge, raising funds for CANFAR. The second CANFAR Club was born at Dalhousie University in 2004. In their first year, Dalhousie generated funds for CANFAR through small fundraising and awareness initiatives and a gala event. In 2005, following the example set by McGill and Dalhousie, three new CANFAR Clubs were formally established at the University of Toronto Mississauga, University of Guelph and The University of Western Ontario. Together, the schools raised a combined total of more than $15,000 for HIV/AIDS research in 2005 and held AIDS awareness symposiums on campus, with the goal of initiating a frank discussion about the AIDS pandemic among their peers. In 2008, nineteen campuses were actively engaged in raising funds and awareness about HIV/AIDS. Board of Directors The main role of the Board of Directors is to set the strategic direction of the organization, to hire and support the President and to provide financial, regulatory and reputational oversight. The Board also takes on a fundraising role by assisting the staff through events or programs, as well as providing advice according to each individual's professional area of expertise.

Reusable kidney dishes are usually made of stainless steel, while disposable ones may be made of paper pulp or plastic. The shape of the dish allows it to be held against the patient's body to catch any falling fluids or debris. Various sizes of emesis basin are a common sight in healthcare settings, including facilities such as nursing homes that may have bedridden patients. The disposable version of the kidney dish was invented by Bessie Virginia Blount. The disposable molded pulp kidney dish is replacing reusable kidney dish because single-use products can decrease cross- communication of diseases. Generally, the volume of a pulp kidney dish (or \\"vomit dish\\") is 700 ml. Its length is 25 cm-26 cm, its width 11 cm. Each year more than 100 million pulp kidney dishes are used in hospital or family care. Contrary to its name, emesis basins are not usually used for vomiting, as the depth, size, and sloping walls all contribute to spilling or splashing the vomit rather than catching it. For this purpose, a plastic bag or wash basin is often preferred, especially by ambulance crews who may need to receive the vomit while driving rapidly, and then hand it over for analysis. Emesis basins are suited for more controlled situations. When washing out a small wound, for example, sometimes the wash water is applied from above with an emesis basin held underneath to catch the runoff.

Before 1998, the school was part of the former Toronto Board of Education. The school was founded in 1911 as an offshoot of the Central Technical School. The eight commercial classes which had been taking place in Central Tech were first moved to King Edward Public School and then to Clinton Street Public School. In 1916, the classes were moved into a permanent home when the Collegiate Gothic Central High School of Commerce building opened as a school of business and commerce on Shaw Street. Over the years it has developed into a composite school that offers a broad range of programs, complemented by a full range of core academic subjects, computer classes, music, art, drama, and health and physical education. Courses are offered at the University, University/College and College levels for grade 12 students. Central Commerce Collegiate was renamed to Central Toronto Academy in September 2014. Sports CTA is well known for its senior boys basketball team which won the 2008 TBSSAA City Championship for \\"AAA\\" OFSAA. The team also received the bronze medal in the \\"AAA\\" OFSAA tournament. CTA is also well known for their REACH basketball program. More recently the senior boys' basketball team had won the gold medal in the 2017 \\"A\\" OFSAA tournament. Focus In September 2014, Central Commerce Collegiate Institute was renamed Central Toronto Academy because of the change in the school's ethos, from a school focusing on business and commerce to one whose focus is on arts, academics, and athletics. The school also offers Advanced Placement courses. Central Toronto Academy also offers a Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) program that focuses on social entrepreneurship. This social entrepreneurship SHSM is a ministry-approved specialized enhancement program that allows students to gain valuable transferable skills while meeting the requirements for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma. Based on active partnerships with business leaders (such as Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto fashion experts at GotStyle ) and major university and college partners (such as Ryerson, Ivey School of Business, University of Toronto, Humber College, George Brown ) this program enables students to develop essential skills and work habits required for successful further education and the workplace. The school was awarded a contract with the Ontario Power Authority in 2013 for a solar panel rooftop installation, solidifying the schools' environmentally conscious reputation and offering perspectives in renewable energies for students. Extra curricular activities The school offers many extra curricular clubs such as Anime Club, Band, Bike Club, Biz@CTA, Book Club, Chess Club, Choir, CTA Connect, Dance Club, Dance Pack, Drama Club, Eco-Club, Film Club, Gay-Straight Alliance, Guitar Club, History Club, Homework Club, Morning Radio, Origami Club, Stage Crew, Student Activist, Student Council, CTA SIXess, Web Club, and Yearbook.

A flash flood is a sudden, violent flood after a heavy rain, or occasionally after a dam break. Rainfall intensity and duration, topography, soil conditions, and ground cover contribute to flash flooding. Most flash floods occur when there is a heavy amount of precipitation falling in an area and that water is then channeled through streams or narrow gullies. Flash floods may take minutes or hours to develop. It is possible to experience a flash flood without witnessing any rain. Flash flood alerts There are two types of alerts for flash floods which are issued by the National Weather Service. One is a flash flood watch, which means that conditions are favorable for flash flooding, and the other is a flash flood warning, meaning that a flash flood is occurring or one will occur imminently and is usually issued when there are strong weather radar echoes for an area that is prone to flash flooding. Flash floods can also occur because of a dam or levee failure, or because of a sudden release of water held by an ice jam. Residents are usually urged to do the following when flash flooding is imminent: * Be aware of any signs of heavy rain * Move to higher ground if rapidly rising water is seen or heard * Not attempt to cross the flowing water In addition, some NWS Weather Forecast Offices have instituted an enhanced flash flood warning, referred to as a flash flood emergency (or as termed by the Albany, New York office as a flash flood warning emergency), which indicates a severe flooding situation in densely populated areas, similar to the procedure for declaring a tornado emergency. On August 27, 2017, as Hurricane Harvey brought torrential rain to southeast Texas, the NWS issued a \\"Flash Flood Emergency for Catastrophic Life Threatening Flooding.\\" On September 10, 2017, the NWS issued a Flash Flood Emergency for life-threatening storm surge because of Hurricane Irma in southwestern Florida at the eye landfall. https://web.archive.org/web/20170910195340/http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=FLZ069&warncounty;=FLC021&firewxzone;=FLZ069&local;_place1=Marco%20FL&product1;=Flash+Flood+Warning⪫=25.9541&lon;=-81.7246 http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/#2017-O-NEW-KMFL- FF-W-0007/USCOMP-N0Q-201709101915 On February 6, 2020, the NWS issued a Flash Flood Emergency for Tazewell County, Virginia due to a major storm moving through the area which caused the Clinch River to rise to its highest crest in 40 years.

Thomas Browne, 6th Baronet & 4th Viscount Kenmare (April 1726 - 11 September 1795) was an Irish landowner and politician. He was probably born at Killarney, County Kerry, the second of four children of Valentine Browne, fifth Baronet, third Viscount Kenmare (1695–1736), one of the few remaining great Roman Catholic landowners in Ireland, and his first wife, Honoria Butler (?-1730). Thomas Browne's great-grandfather, Sir Valentine Browne, third Baronet, had been created first Viscount Kenmare by James II in March 1689. This was an Irish peerage created after the removal of James II from the English throne, but during the period when James was de facto king of Ireland, before the conquest of Ireland by William III. The first and second viscounts had fought for James II but seem never to have been formally attainted under William. Consequently, the peerage remained on the Irish patent roll in a constitutionally ambiguous position, but was not formally recognised by the Protestant political establishment. Thomas Browne was reportedly educated at Westminster School until the death of his father in 1736. Browne's older brother, Valentine, had died in 1728, so Thomas inherited the peerage and the estate (of more than 120,000 acres) intact. Repeated attempts to persuade him to convert to the English established church came to nothing, even though his refusal cost him a university matriculation at Oxford and a place in the English House of Commons. In 1750, he married Anne Cooke, daughter of Thomas Cooke of Painstown, County Carlow, with whom he had two children. Kenmare's aristocratic status and landownership naturally led him to play a prominent role in Catholic politics during the later eighteenth century. Kenmare sought to show that Roman Catholics could be incorporated in the Protestant settlement of eighteenth-century Ireland. In the early 1760s, he proposed unsuccessfully the establishment of an Irish regiment, with Catholic officers as well as other ranks, formally in Portuguese service but in practice supporting Britain's effort during the Seven Years' War. At the same time, Kenmare, and other heads of Catholic families, were suspected by some Protestants of organising the Whiteboy agrarian riots in Munster as part of a conspiracy to gain power in Ireland with French assistance. The desire of prominent Catholics to show that they did not wish forcibly to overthrow the constitutional settlement contributed to the development of the Catholic Committee, formed to argue for Catholic relief in Ireland. During the 1770s, with Arthur James Plunkett, seventh earl of Fingall, and Anthony Preston, eleventh Viscount Gormanston, as well as a number of senior bishops, Kenmare formed a conservative party on the committee, arguing that Catholic relief was best obtained by producing declarations of loyalty and maintaining good relations with the Dublin and London administrations. This group became the dominant force on the committee. Kenmare's correspondence with Edmund Burke shows that he maintained communication with the British parliamentary opposition, but he principally regarded the economic and constitutional reform championed by the Rockingham whigs and their Irish allies as a distraction that conflicted with his wish to maintain close ties with the government. To this end, he supported the recruitment of soldiers in Ireland to fight for Britain in the American War of Independence during the 1770s. His pro- government policy began to pay dividends when the first important Relief Acts were passed in 1778 and 1782, though other factors, including the development of Irish patriotism, the decline of Jacobitism, and the changing imperial context, were undoubtedly important as well. The political ferment in Ireland following the recognition of legislative independence in 1782 threatened Kenmare's strategy. Demands for the widening of the parliamentary franchise among the volunteer and patriot movements raised the question of whether Catholics should be included in any measure of reform, but involvement in the campaign was opposed by Kenmare and the conservatives on the committee, which never actually discussed the issue. On 11 November 1783, at the start of a discussion on Catholic relief at the national convention of volunteers in Dublin, George Ogle, a Wexford MP, announced that he had received \\"a letter from a Roman Catholic peer expressive of the sentiments of the Catholics in general … that they had relinquished the idea of making any claims further than the religious liberties they enjoyed.\\" Ogle's intervention stopped debate on Catholic claims. Though purportedly written by Kenmare, the letter was actually composed by his cousin, Sir Boyle Roche, who, as a Protestant, had represented Kenmare's views in the Commons. Kenmare could therefore deny authorship, ensuring that no break with the administration occurred, and that division in the committee was avoided. Lord Kenmare died at Killarney on 11 September 1795, and was succeeded by his son Valentine Browne (1754–1812), who maintained his father's political stance, and was created earl of Kenmare in 1801.

It is called wet chemistry since most analyzing is done in the liquid phase. Wet chemistry is also called bench chemistry since many tests are performed at lab benches. Materials Wet chemistry commonly uses laboratory glassware such as beakers and graduated cylinders to prevent materials from being contaminated or interfered with by unintended sources. Gasoline, Bunsen burners, and crucibles may also be used to evaporate and isolate substances in their dry forms. Wet chemistry is not performed with any advanced instruments since most automatically scan substances. Although, simple instruments such as scales are used to measure the weight of a substance before and after a change occurs. Many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods. History Before the age of theoretical and computational chemistry, wet chemistry was the predominant form of scientific discovery in the chemical field. This is why it is sometimes referred to as classic chemistry or classical chemistry. Scientists would continuously develop techniques to improve the accuracy of wet chemistry. Later on, instruments were developed to conduct research impossible for wet chemistry. Over time, this became a separate branch of analytical chemistry called instrumental analysis. Because of the high volume of wet chemistry that must be done in today's society and new quality control requirements, many wet chemistry methods have been automated and computerized for streamlined analysis. The manual performance of wet chemistry mostly occurs in schools.  Methods  = Qualitative Methods = Qualitative methods use changes in information that cannot be quantified to detect a change. This can include a change in color, smell, texture, etc.  Chemical Tests  When burned, lead produces a bright white flame. Chemical tests use reagents to indicate the presence of a specific chemical in an unknown solution. The reagents cause a unique reaction to occur based on the chemical it reacts with, allowing one to know what chemical is in the solution. An example is Heller's test where a test tube containing proteins has strong acids added to it. A cloudy ring forms where the substances meet, indicating the acids are denaturing the proteins. The cloud is a sign that proteins are present in a liquid. The method is used to detect proteins in a person's urine. = Flame Test = The flame test is a more well known version of the chemical test. It is only used on metallic ions. The metal powder is burned, causing an emission of colors based on what metal was burned. For example, Calcium (Ca) will burn orange and Copper (Cu) will burn blue. Their color emissions are used to produce bright colors in fireworks. = Quantitative Methods = Quantitative methods use information that can be measured and quantified to indicate a change. This can include changes in volume, concentration, weight, etc. Solids are filtered out of the liquid, which is collected in the beaker.  Gravimetric Analysis  Gravimetric analysis measures the weight or concentration of a solid that has either formed from a precipitate or dissolved in a liquid. The mass of the liquid is recorded before undergoing the reaction. For the precipitate, a reagent is added until the precipitate stops forming. The precipitate is then dried and weighed to determine the chemicals concentration in the liquid. For a dissolved substance, the liquid can be filtered until the solids are removed or boiled until all the liquid evaporates. The solids are left alone until completely dried and then weighed to determine its concentration. Evaporating all the liquid is the more common approach.  Volumetric Analysis  Titration is called volumetric analysis since it relies on volume measurements to determine the quantity of a chemical. A reagent with a known volume and concentration is added to a solution with an unknown substance and concentration. The amount of reagent required for a change to occur is proportional to the amount of the unknown substances. This reveals the amount of the unknown substance present. If no visible change is present, an indicator is added to the solution. The indicator changes color based on the pH of the solution. The exact point where the color change occurs is called the endpoint. Since the color change can occur very suddenly, it is important to be extremely precise with all measurements. = Colorimetry = Colorimetry is a unique method since it has both qualitative and quantitative properties. Its qualitative analysis involves recording color changes to indicate a change has occurred. This can be a change in shading of the color or a change into a completely different color. The quantitative aspect involves sensory equipment that can measure the wavelength of colors. Changes in wavelengths can be precisely measured and help indicate changes. Uses Wet chemistry techniques can be used for qualitative chemical measurements, such as changes in color (colorimetry), but often involves more quantitative chemical measurements, using methods such as gravimetry and titrimetry. Some uses for wet chemistry include tests for: * pH (acidity, alkalinity) * concentration * conductivity (Specific Conductance) * cloud point (nonionic surfactants) * hardness * melting point * solids or dissolved solids * salinity * specific gravity * density * turbidity * viscosity * moisture (Karl Fischer titration) Wet chemistry is also used in environmental chemistry settings to determine the current state of the environment. It is used to test: * Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) * Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) * eutrophication * coating identification It can also involve the elemental analysis of samples, e.g., water sources, for items like: * Ammonia Nitrogen * Chloride * Chromium * Cyanide * dissolved Oxygen * Fluoride * Nitrogen * Nitrate * Phenols * Phosphate * Phosphorus * Silica * Sulfate, Sulfide See also * Wet laboratory * Analytical Chemistry Further reading * *Charles M.

Shirer (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1969) deals with the collapse of the French Third Republic as a result of Hitler's invasion during World War II. Prewar As a CBS correspondent in Germany during the climactic events under discussion and as a frequent visitor to and correspondent from prewar France, Shirer was left to question how Germany had overrun France within weeks in 1940. Both countries had fought each other for four years in 1914-1918, with France successfully resisting Germany at every turn of battle along the Western Front during World War I. Shirer, who knew French, did much of his own research for his 1969 book by speaking with surviving politicians and French leaders from the immediate prewar period as well as those who were on duty during the final catastrophe. His conclusion was that France had defeated itself. Unhealed wounds in its civil society, dating back to the 1890s Dreyfus Affair, had left France's political left and right with unassuageable feelings of resentment towards each other. The 1930s Great Depression further inflamed the feelings of bitterness. The right, in particular, believed that its country's secular leadership was condemning the country to decadence. A badly-divided France tried to avoid war with Adolf Hitler by participating fully in the negotiations at Munich in 1938, but Hitler forced the issue the following year by his invasion of Poland. World War II had begun. Collapse In 1939 and 1940, France faced a united, determined, and technologically-sophisticated enemy. Although it was desperately important for France to match its enemy's traits with determination and unity of its own, French national leaders instead frittered away their final months before the catastrophe in a round of internal hostility, intrigue and backbiting, which led to the restoration of World War I hero Marshal Philippe Pétain as prime minister. The French media had become thoroughly corrupt. Newspapers, in particular, were bought and paid for by political factions and served as their mouthpieces. The German Blitzkrieg defeated the French Army and France's will to fight and resist the invaders. After the Second Armistice at Compiègne, many Frenchmen, especially on the right, believed that their country had deserved to lose the war. Key leaders and politicians, led by the aging Pétain and the corrupt, power-hungry Pierre Laval, stepped in and proclaimed their devotion to the survival of France within a Hitlerian New Order for Europe. Overawing the French Parliament, which had fled occupied Paris and was meeting in exile in the resort town of Vichy, they forced their fellow politicians to grant them full powers to control the remainder of unoccupied France for the remainder of the war. The Third Republic could not survive that disgrace. After the regime of the Pétainist French State (État français) and the liberation by the Allies, French officials did not restore the former constitution but quickly wrote a new constitution. Its ratification, in October 1946, paved the way for the French Fourth Republic. References Category:1969 non-fiction books Category:Books by William L.

It caters to approximately 1100 pupils in Years 7 to 13, including nearly 150 in its sixth form. History The school was planned as part of the development of Crawley as a new town in the late 1940s. Originally it had been intended to open a grammar school and two secondary modern schools on the Tilgate campus, although by the time the school was built, this plan changed to provide a bilateral secondary school for boys and girls for a trial period of two years. This entitled the school to run separate grammar and secondary modern departments as part of one school. The school was named after Sir Thomas Bennett, the chairman of Crawley Development Corporation. This body had overseen the development of the New Town. Bennett officially opened the school in 1959 (the first pupils having joined the school in 1958). Although originally intended as a bilateral school, the staff of the school organised classes along comprehensive lines, with students working in sets depending on their ability in subjects, rather than broad streams. This idea proved so popular that the school became formally comprehensive by the end of the trial in 1960. In 1974, local schools were reorganised in the area, and Thomas Bennett School became an Upper school for students aged 12 to 18, with former first year students remaining for an additional year in primary middle schools. This situation was then reversed in 2004, when reorganisation again returned the school to a full 11–18 secondary. The school converted to academy status in September 2012. Campus New buildings of Thomas Bennett Community College The masterplan for Crawley New Town set aside the campus for the split-site school in the south-west corner of the neighbourhood of Tilgate between the A23 and Tilgate Forest. The campus contained both the Thomas Bennett school and the local primary school – Desmond Anderson School. The original school comprised first two and then three main buildings at opposite ends of the campus. The adjoining Ashdown and Southgate buildings provided facilities, with a further building – known as the Canterbury building – approximately 1/4-mile to the south-east. Uses of the buildings varied. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Canterbury building was used for 'lower school' pupils in the first two years of school, with 'upper school' pupils in fourth and fifth forms moving to the Southgate building, and sixth formers based in the Ashdown building. By the 1990s, pupils in the main part of the school were split equally between Canterbury and Southgate buildings, depending on their house. Both Thomas Bennett and Desmond Anderson schools were re-built, opening in entirely new buildings in 2005. The campus is now shared with the town's main leisure facilities: K2 Leisure Centre. The current building, designed by Nicholas Hare Architects, houses all pupils from all year groups in a building built under a Private Finance Initiative scheme which replaced several schools in the town in the period 2004–2005. A Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment audit reported that the building was well-designed. Students The school is entirely comprehensive, providing education for approximately 1300 pupils aged between 11 and 18 of all abilities. The school was formerly much larger with around 2000 pupils, but has reduced in recent years. The school is organised into four houses, named after the original house masters/mistresses when the school opened in the 1950s, each of which was allocated a colour: *Hepburn (White) *Parker (Green) *Roberts (Blue) *Wallis (Red) Most pupils attending the school live within the catchment area, and transfer from one of the local primary schools: *Broadfield East Junior School *Desmond Anderson Primary School *Hilltop Primary School *Seymour Primary School *The Oaks Primary School Notable former pupils * Footballer Brian BasonEngland v Germany Schools' International football programme, 16 May 1970, p10 * Travel writer Simon Calder * Politician Dawn Primarolo * Porl Thompson of The Cure External links * Thomas Bennett Community College website References 5\\\\. https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/06/patrick-daunt Category:Buildings and structures in Crawley Category:Secondary Schools in Crawley Category:Secondary schools in West Sussex Category:Academies in West Sussex Category:Educational institutions established in 1959 Category:1959 establishments in England ","title":"Thomas Bennett Community College"},{"id":"5653067","text":"South Lodge, at the entrance to Fairford Park, one of Ernest Cook's estates in Gloucestershire Ernest Edward Cook (4 September 1865 – 14 March 1955) was an English philanthropist and businessman.

In 1928, along with his brother Frank, he sold his business interest in the family firm to the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. Following the sale, Cook retired to Bath, and devoted himself to his art collection and the acquisition of country estates. He accumulated a large collection of fine and decorative art, which on his death became the largest bequest ever left to the National Art Collections Fund. In 1931 he acquired Montacute House in Somerset and the Bath Assembly Rooms for the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. He became a major benefactor of the National Trust, and encouraged the Trust to acquire historic country houses and estates. Montacute House and the Assembly Rooms were transferred to the National Trust. Cook acquired a total of seventeen estates, of which Bradenham, Buscot and Coleshill passed to the National Trust.

Signs and symptoms People usually complain of pain in one joint, which persists for months, or even years, does not ease with exercise, steroid injection or heat treatment, shows nothing on X-ray, but shows a definite restriction of movement. There are 3 defined stages to this disease: * early: no loose bodies but active synovial disease; * transitional: active synovial disease, and loose bodies; * late: loose bodies but no synovial disease; In the early stages of the disease it is often confused with tendinitis and/or arthritis. Once it reaches transitional the loose bodies become apparent with X-ray in greater than 70% of cases, with MRI often showing where xray fails. In experienced hands, US is also useful for the diagnosis.Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Free chapter on ultrasound findings of synovial chondromatosis affecting the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa available at ShoulderUS.com In the disease, the thin flexible membrane of the synovium gradually forms blisters which calcify and enlarge. These nodules eventually break free and float around the joint space becoming larger – these add to the discomfort and stiffness of the joint. The disease is rare and little known and there is currently no known cure. The affected tissue will show up as a semi-solid mass in a MRI scan, final diagnosis is usually confirmed by taking a biopsy. Synovial chondromatosis occurs twice as commonly in males as females and usually in their forties. However, online communities for synovial chondromatosis patients have yielded a stark contrast, with equal representation from both genders and members diagnosed as young as late teenage/early 20s. The disease generally affects only one of the larger weight bearing joints (hip, ankle, knee) – although the elbow, and wrist can also be affected. Rarely involves the temporal mandibular joint.Fuller E, Bharatha A, Yeung R, Kassel EE, Aviv RI, Howard P, Symons SP. Case of the month #166: synovial chondromatosis of the temporal mandibular joint. Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal. 2011 May; 62(2):151-153. Cause The exact underlying cause of synovial chondromatosis is unknown. Some evidence suggests trauma may play a role in its development as it mainly presents in weight-bearing joints. Infection has also been considered as a contributing factor. The condition is not inherited. Synovial chondromatosis can reportedly occur as either a primary or secondary form. Primary synovial chondromatosis, which is more rare, occurs spontaneously and does not appear to relate to any pre-existing conditions. Secondary synovial chondromatosis is the more common form and often occurs when there is pre-existent osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, neuropathic osteoarthropathy (which often occurs in diabetic individuals), tuberculosis, or osteochondral fractures (torn cartilage covering the end of a bone in a joint) in the affected individual. Diagnosis Proton density weighted MRI of a knee with synovial chondromatosis. There are multiple intra-articular loose bodies located in the suprapatellar recess. (CC BY 4.0) Treatment Treatment is frequently by means of removal of the loose bodies and of a partial or full synovectomy (removal of the synovium) Full synovectomy is a moderately major operation and involves completely exposing the joint and removing the affected tissue. Partial synovectomy is normally done arthroscopically. Synovectomies are normally carried out by shaving the lining of the knee but there are other ways of achieving this by either freezing the synovium or by the use of radiation treatment. The need for further procedures is greater than 25% although normally the frequency of the required removal of loose bodies is reduced by the previous synovectomy. There have been documented cases of malignant transformation however this is rare. Whilst the condition can be described as a ‘benign growth’ it seldom affects more than one joint, and does not usually affect surrounding tissue. Names It is also known as Reichel's syndrome or Reichel-Jones-Henderson syndrome, named after Friedrich Paul Reichel, Hugh Toland Jones and Melvin Starkey Henderson.

Her marriage to Silvio Perla (a Swiss athlete, specialist in the 5000 m) ended in divorce, which was finalized after the war.  Schooling  She attended the Conservatoire de Paris, where she studied under Germaine Martinelli, obtaining a first prize in piano (despite her diminutive size and very small hands) and at the same time worked nights, singing in bars.  During the War  During the Second World War, she joined the French Resistance in 1940 until her arrest and deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she was a member of the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz, then to Bergen-Belsen, until she was freed in 1945. Suffering from a potentially fatal case of typhus and weighing only 65 pounds, she sang for the BBC on the day of her liberation by British troops. (A Library of Congress entry for this recording gives her name as Fanja Perla, her married name at the time; her divorce from Perla was finalized after the war.) Under her pseudonym of \\"Fénelon\\", which she took up after the war, Goldstein became a well known cabaret singer. In 1966 she went with her African-American life-partner, baritone singer Aubrey Pankey, to East Berlin. After Pankey's death she returned to France. From 1973 to 1975, with Marcelle Routier, she wrote Sursis pour l'orchestre, a book about her experiences, based on the diary she kept at the concentration camps. It dealt with the degrading compromises survivors had to make, the black humor of inmates who would sometimes laugh hysterically over gruesome sights, the religious and national tensions among inmates (e.g. between the Jewish musicians and the Poles, some of whom were anti-Semitic), and the normality of prostitution and lesbian relationships. At Birkenau, Fénelon served as a pianist, one of the two main singers, an occasional arranger of musical pieces, and even a temporary drummer, when the original drummer briefly took ill.Profile, Jta.org; accessed 16 November 2014. All of the orchestra members survived the war, except two players, Lola Kroner and Julie Stroumsa, and conductor Alma Rosé who died of a sudden illness, possibly food poisoning, at the camp.

After the War  Linda Yellen filmed Playing for Time using as script a dramatic adaptation by Arthur Miller.

I wanted Liza Minnelli. She's small, she's full of life, she sings and dances. Vanessa ... doesn't have a sense of humor, and that is the one thing that saved me from death in the camp\\", Fénelon said. She scolded Redgrave in person during a 60 Minutes interview but the actress garnered the support of the acting community. Fénelon never forgave Redgrave, but eventually softened her view of the production to concede that it was \\"a fair film\\".Robert Charles Reimer, Carol J. Reimer.

It is located in the northwest of the island of Ireland on the border between County Leitrim (in Ireland) and County Fermanagh (in the United Kingdom).http://www.wfdfish.ie/wp- content/uploads/2010/07/melvin_mini_report_2008.pdf Ecology The water quality was reported to be excellent with an oligotrophic rating. The ecology of Lough Melvin, and other Irish waterways, remain threatened by curly waterweed, zebra mussel, and freshwater clam invasive species. Fishes and angling The Lough Melvin charr (Salvelinus grayi), a species unique to the lake. Now critically endangered. Lough Melvin is one of Ireland's famous angling loughs offering the chance of spring salmon from February to May, grilse from May to July and gillaroo, sonaghan and ferox trout throughout the season. Lough Melvin is also home to an endemic species of char, the Melvin charr or Gray's charr (Salvelinus grayi).Fishbase – Salvelinus grayi A ghillie or boatman is strongly recommended to anglers unfamiliar with the lake. =Gillaroo trout= Lough Melvin is home to the gillaroo or Salmo stomachius, a species of trout which eats primarily snails. The name \\"gillaroo\\" is derived from the Irish language Giolla Rua, which means \\"Red Fellow\\". This is due to the fishes distinctive colouring. It has a bright buttery golden colour in its flanks with bright crimson and vermillion spots. The gillaroo feed almost exclusively on bottom living animals (snails, sedge fly larva and freshwater shrimp) with the exception of late summer when they come to the surface to feed and may be caught on the dry fly.The Trouts – Gillaroo Irish Char Conservation Group =Sonaghan trout= The sonaghan trout (Salmo nigripinnis) is another species of salmonid unique to Lough Melvin. It can have a light brown or silvery hue with large, distinctive black spots. Its fins are dark brown or black with elongated pectorals. Sonaghan are found in areas of open, deep water, where they feed on mid-water planktonic organisms such as water fleas (Cladocera), midge (chironomid) pupae and phantom (Chaoborus) larvae. Sonaghan will be most readily located close to the surface over deep water. Fly-fishing with a team of wet flies fished in classic lough style (i.e. short, snappy casts from a boat drifting beam-on to the breeze) gives best chance of success. Sonaghan give a powerful and energetic fight out of all proportion to their size.The Trouts – Sonaghen Irish Char Conservation Group =Ferox trout= The classic work carried out by Andrew Ferguson of Queens University on the genetics of the trout of Lough Melvin identified the ferox as a separate subspecies. The fish home to a specific spawning area and are reproductively isolated. They are also one of the oldest trout races to colonise Ireland, perhaps as old as 50,000 years. Ferox cannibalise brown trout (which returned to many of the same lakes when geological processes and climatic conditions allowed) and also prey on other fish species. The best method of capture is trolling, particularly with a Rapala type lure.The Trouts – Ferox Irish Char Conservation Group =see also= *Dollaghan Panoramic view See also *List of loughs in Ireland References and notes =Notes= =Primary sources= =Secondary sources= * * Melvin Melvin Category:Fishing in Ireland Melvin Category:Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border ","title":"Lough Melvin"},{"id":"5653242","text":"Passageway in the market Souvenirs in the market The annexe along Jalan Hang Kasturi Central Market Kuala Lumpur is a market in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Background Central Market Kuala Lumpur is located at Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock (Foch Avenue) and the pedestrian-only section of Jalan Hang Kasturi (Rodger Street), a few minutes away from Petaling Street. It was founded in 1888 and originally used as a wet market, while the current Art Deco style building was completed in 1937. It has been classified as a Heritage Site by the Malaysian Heritage Society and it is now a landmark for Malaysian culture and heritage. History The original building was built in 1888 by the British in colonial British Malaya. It was used as wet market for Kuala Lumpur citizens and tin miners. The Wet Market was very convenient to the early city dwellers because it was within the vicinity of Klang bus stand, the hub of feeder bus service for Kuala Lumpur and the train station. Further expansions were made in 1889, 1895, 1920 and 1921. By 1933, the expansions to the warehouse made the market now in its present size, and cost around $167,000. As Kuala Lumpur experienced its own development at a rapid pace in the 1970s, there were plans to demolish the site. The intervention of the Malaysian Heritage Society proved timely as they successfully petitioned against its deconstruction and the site was declared as a 'Heritage Site'. During construction of Dayabumi near Klang River banks in 1981, the market was saved from demolition. In 1985, the market was renovated into a vibrant and colourful new style, and has been officially known as Pasar Budaya since April 1986. The Central Market Annexe, located at the back of main building, formerly housed a cineplex and was opened in 2006. The Annexe houses a variety of eclectic art galleries. It is one of the major art spaces in Kuala Lumpur and is a hub of activity all year long which features artworks by local artists. Located alongside the main building is the newly transformed, pedestrianized and covered walkway, Kasturi Walk. Opened in 2011, Kasturi Walk boasts an al fresco ambiance featuring an exciting variety of stalls selling tantalizing local snacks and exquisite souvenirs. The street is noted for housing street musicians or \\"buskers\\". Features The Central Market Kuala Lumpur is arranged in a stall concept, representing the traditional market that has existed in Kuala Lumpur since the 1800s. Travelers can scroll through the many sections that exists within the Central Market, from the Lorong Melayu, Straits Chinese, and Lorong India which is located on the west wing. The second floor hosts a food court, offering an array of food. Notable are two-storey and single- storey buildings resembling the kampong-style houses representing the many ethnic groups living harmoniously in Kuala Lumpur. ;Architecture * Art Deco architecture Transport Central Market Kuala Lumpur is near the Pasar Seni station which is served by the LRT Kelana Jaya Line and the MRT Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line.

Camfed programs operate in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.  History  Camfed was founded in 1993 by Ann Cotton to support girls to go to school who would otherwise be denied an education because of poverty. The idea for Camfed came from after a research trip to Zimbabwe in which she came to believe that the low enrollment of females in school was due to poverty that did not allow them to cover the school fees. It began with support for 32 girls to attend secondary school in two rural districts of Zimbabwe. By 2017, Camfed had supported more than 1.5 million children through education in a network of 5,500 schools https://camfedorg2015.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/files/Camfed_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2016.pdf in Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Anticipating the need for post-school economic opportunities for young people in marginalized rural communities, the Camfed Alumnae Association (CAMA) was established in 1998 to connect young female school leavers and offer pathways to post-secondary school opportunities. CAMA provides a structure through which its members can develop their activism and leadership. By 2017, CAMA had a membership of 84,675https://camfedorg2015.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/files/Camfed_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2016.pdf young women, among them now teachers, business leaders, government officials, health professionals and entrepreneurs. A hallmark of Camfed is the activism and philanthropy of its alumnae network, who are actively raising and administering funds to support the next generation of children in school. Camfed is overseen by an Executive Team of Directors from all Camfed offices led by its CEO, Lucy Lake, who joined Camfed in 1994.  Work  Camfed focuses on rural areas of Africa where poverty is widespread, and girls and young women face massive exclusion from education and the opportunities that are afforded by education. Camfed works to build around girls a supportive environment in which they can attend, and succeed, at primary and secondary school, and progress into young adulthood with opportunities that include professional training, higher education and job creation. Camfed provides aid by paying for school fees, providing school uniforms, books, and sanitary protection. They also work with the school by training teachers to be mentors. =CAMA= CAMA, the Camfed Alumnae Association, is the alumnae association for Camfed graduates.\\"CAMA alumnae: Young women leading change\\", Camfed. CAMA provides a structure through which its members can develop their activism and leadership. This is referred to as the 'CAMA Multiplier Effect', where these young women graduates are now leading the movement for girls' education in their communities. The ability of CAMA members to lead and implement such long lasting change comes from their lived experience. =The Learner Guide Program= The Learner Guide program was started and is run by women in the Camfed alumnae association CAMA network who volunteer in local schools to deliver a tailored curriculum encompassing leadership, health, learning and life skills to their younger peers. This is a two part project that concurrently addresses equal access to quality education for children and the post-secondary school transition period for young women. Firstly, the Learner Guide Program offers a training program for young women to become Learner Guides, opening up post-secondary opportunities, providing transferable skills training, and work experience. Secondly, Learner Guides deliver a tailored program that supports marginalized children through their education, alongside the standard school curriculum. Camfed and the Sustainable Development Goals The Sustainable Development Goals, a set of universal goals aimed to tackle poverty, inequality, discrimination and climate change across the world, came into action on the 1st January 2016. As part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, these goals are designed to mobilize global efforts to transform the world in fifteen years. Camfed is contributing directly to progress with SDG4: Quality Education. In addition, through the sustainable and scalable programs introduced by Camfed in educating girls, and supporting young women through their transition into secure livelihoods, Camfed’s work contributes to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals including Goal 1: Poverty, Goal 3: Good Health, Goal 5: Gender Equality, Goal 13: Climate Action, and more. Accreditation Awards In October 2014, Camfed was recognised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for best practice in taking development innovation to scale.

John Nash was Secretary of Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1931 until his retirement in 1971, when he was succeeded by Joe Lister. He became one of the most respected figures in cricket, making a host of friends throughout the world. He joined the clerical staff at Yorkshire in 1922 and in his time as secretary he rarely saw a full day's cricket because of the complexity of administrative duties, but his efficiency became a by-word. He was joint-manager with Brigadier M. A. Green of the M.C.C. team captained by F. R. Brown that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1950-51. Outside of cricket, he led a full life. He was an organist of great ability, playing for many years at Farsley Parish Church, where he was also secretary of the Church Council. He died from a heart attack in April 1977.

A graduate of the University of the Philippines College of Law, he was admitted as a lawyer to the Philippine bar in 1954. He became the Baguio City Secretary in 1955 to 1959. Yaranon was elected as Baguio City Councilor from 1960 to 1963. In 1964, he was elected as the Baguio City Vice Mayor. He was the Baguio City Judge from 1980 to 1987. From 1987 to 1997 he was the executive judge in the regional trial court in San Fernando, La Union. After his retirement from the judiciary, he was elected as a city councilor for Baguio City. Mayor of Baguio City Yaranon was elected to his first term as mayor of Baguio in 2004, defeating the incumbent, Bernardo Vergara. Yaranon successfully campaigned on a platform that stressed environmental issues, clean government, and opposition to the collection of parking fees in Baguio City streets. Nonetheless, Yaranon's term was marred by controversies. In 2005, Yaranon was cited for direct contempt by the Supreme Court for defying a writ of injunction issued by the high court in relation to the controversy on the collection of parking fees in Baguio City. A petition for his recall as mayor was soon initiated. It was also during Yaranon's term that a limited outbreak of meningococcemia in Baguio City dampened tourism during the usually busy summer months. In late June 2006, Yaranon was ordered suspended for one year (until June 30, 2007) by the Office of the President, on charges of grave misconduct and abuse of authority filed by a private pay-parking company operating in Baguio City. Yaranon appealed the ruling, which he insisted was not yet final. Nonetheless, Baguio City Vice-Mayor Reinaldo Bautista took his oath of office as \\"acting mayor\\" on July 20, 2006. Yaranon refused to step aside for Bautista. Despite his suspension from office, Yaranon sought re- election as mayor in the May 2007 general elections. He was defeated by Bautista.

West Virginia Route 94 was signed on this bridge until 1984 when U.S. Route 52 was diverted on to a new route with Interstate 64.

Overview Live-fire exercise for marksmanship and weapons handling in March 2003, part of the CJTF-HOA. The mission of the CJTF-HOA is to conduct operations in the Combined Joint Operations Area to enhance partner nation capacity, promote regional security and stability, dissuade conflict, and protect U.S. and coalition interests. CJTF-HOA consists of about 2,000 servicemen and women from the United States military and allied countries. Currently, the task force has an assigned area of interest that includes Sudan, Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Seychelles and Kenya. Outside this Combined Joint Operating Area, the CJTF-HOA has operations in Mauritius, Comoros, Liberia, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania. CJTF-HOA operations are encompassed by what the U.S. military has termed the ‘indirect approach’ with a focus on military-to-military engagements, civil- military operations, key leader engagements, and providing enabling support to partner nations. They provide short-term assistance by drilling wells for clean water, building functional schools, improving roadways and improving medical facilities. Long-term goals include working with partner nations to improve national and regional stability and security. Regional stability is increased through capacity-building operations such as civil affairs and military-to-military training; engineering and humanitarian support; medical, dental, and veterinarian civic action programs (MEDCAP, DENTCAP, VETCAP); security training for border and coastal areas; and counter-IED (C-IED) integration training.

In November 2002, personnel embarked to the region aboard USS Mount Whitney and arrived at the Horn of Africa on December 8, 2002. CJTF-HOA operated from the Mount Whitney until May 13, 2003, when the mission moved ashore to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti City, Djibouti. Since then, CJTF-HOA personnel have built schools, clinics and hospitals; conducted dozens of MEDCAPs, DENTCAPs and VETCAPs; drilled and refurbished more than 113 water wells; and trained in collaboration with partner nation militaries. In January 2004, Brigadier General Mastin Robison of the United States Marine Corps, then commanding the Task Force, had support, medical, and admin staff from the Marines, Navy, Army, and Air Force, a Marine helicopter detachment of four CH-53 Super Stallions, a U.S. Army infantry company, a U.S. Army Reserve civil affairs company, Navy cargo planes, military engineers, and a special operations unit under his command.Chris Tomlinson, 'U.S. wages quiet battle in Africa,' Associated Press, in The Washington Times, January 15, 2004 Additionally, members of the Task Force assisted with humanitarian assistance missions, including recovery efforts after the collapse of a four-story building in Kenya in 2006, the capsizing of a passenger ferry in Djibouti in 2006, and floods in Ethiopia and Kenya in 2006.

Designed by Hans Poelzig in 1929 after he won an architectural competition, the building contains three large centrally located broadcasting spaces, which are shielded from street noise by the surrounding office wings. It is used today by local ARD broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin- Brandenburg (RBB) to make programmes carried by its Inforadio, Kulturradio, and Radio Berlin 88,8 channels. The building's large broadcasting spaces are occasionally also used to host concerts. History The building, the ground plan of which is a triangle with two curved sides and a 150-metre-long straight façade clad with ceramic tiles, was constructed between 1929 and 1930 and inaugurated on 22 January 1931 as the seat of the Reichs-Rundfunk- Gesellschaft. The large, central broadcasting space was finished in 1933. On 22 March 1935 the first regular television service in Germany Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow was begun here, but moved to a separate building on nearby Theodor-Heuss-Platz in 1937. The Haus des Rundfunks also had an important influence on the development of stereophonic sound and its adoption by radio broadcasting. Some radio programming continued during the war, notably the Wunschkonzert für die Wehrmacht (\\"Request Concert for the Armed Forces\\"), broadcast from the Haus des Rundfunks on Sunday afternoons from 1939 to 1941. After World War II, the Haus des Rundfunks became something of a Cold War issue: although situated in the British Sector of West Berlin, it was used by the Berliner Rundfunk radio station, which was controlled by the Soviet occupation forces, until the station moved to East Berlin in 1952. The building was not handed over to the West Berlin mayor Otto Suhr by the Soviet military command until 5 July 1956. After considerable renovation work, it was used from the end of 1957 as the home of Sender Freies Berlins, which was to merge on 1 May 2003 merged with Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg. The building The Haus des Rundfunks was one of the first buildings in Europe dedicated solely to broadcasting and is exceeded in age only by the Münchner Funkhaus. It is thus especially noteworthy that the building still offers ideal conditions for broadcast production today. At the time, Hans Poelzig had almost no examples to emulate but he developed ideas which are still valid today: the office and editorial rooms are located in the outer areas of the building, thereby surrounding the three large studio complexes. The largest broadcasting space is the heart of the building, and as well as this there is also a smaller broadcasting room and an area which, with its diversity of acoustic characteristics, is used for the production of radio drama. Poelzig put a great deal of thought into the acoustic properties of the studios. The chairs in the large broadcasting space were specially designed so that seats had the same sound-absorbing qualities whether occupied or not. In the smaller broadcasting room a hundred wall panels could be flipped. One side of the panels absorbed sound, the other reflected it. In this way very different reverberation effects could be achieved.

Format  Day camps focus on topics such as art, music, science, nature or sports, although some caregivers also use it as a substitute for daycare. Many families enroll their children in day camps during the summer so that they have supervision during the day. Camps foster children's emotional, social, and physical and creative growth through various interactive activities and relationships with role model counselors. Generally camps focus on children with the exception of specialized camps that aim to develop specific skill sets which are directed at campers up through adolescence years. Archery is one of the many sports that children play at day camp. Sports-focused day camps are designed for younger athletes or for high-energy kids who may need a positive outlet for their energy. Day camps are less expensive than sleepaway camps (e.g., summer camps), because they often do not entail as many or any meals or as much supervised time each day. Some day camps are located at the same site as a resident camp with the same resources and activities to serve local campers along with kids from abroad. Many day camps are located in city parks, sport complexes, schools or community centers such as a YMCA or Boy Scouts or by government organizations. Recreational day camps are camps in which one would be able to sign up for through the township they live in. Recreational day camps cost significantly less than privately owned because they are funded by the township it is located in. Private Day camps are able to have bigger campuses on a private location and charge what they want to.  Cost  The cost of day camps according to the American Camp Association, day camps that are ACA accredited are typically ranges from anywhere to $201 to $400 a week for day camps, depending on the type of camp that it is. Day camps which are sometimes run by nonprofit organizations are usually the most affordable they start as low as $100 a week and can range to $500. For-profit camps can cost anywhere up to $300-$500 a week. Privately owned or specialized day camps can be a variety of specialty camps that teach the children specific skills. Because of the one on one attention that the child gets, prices will be much higher than other day camps. These prices could range from $500 to $1,000 per week.  Education  Day camps teach children an abundance of skills that they can utilize. Campers are able to learn independence through day camps because children are going to be responsible for changing themselves, making sure they are aware of where their belongings are and deciding what they want to eat for the day. Day camps educate children on new skills that they are able to see from the professionals working at the day camps and also from their peers. With the set of new skills that the child has from day camp they are also able to gain courage for trying new things. Camps as a whole are recognized by child development professionals as places where children are able to learn how to create relationships with friends that they would be less likely to make in other settings. Day camps teach children how to mature socially, emotionally, intellectually and physically. Camps give children a sense of community of their own. Day camps educate young people on how to discover their talents, interests and values more extensively than in other settings such as school.

Summary  Mediated aims at creating awareness rather than offering ready-made solutions to remedy the intrusion of too much media in our industrial societies. Rather than writing yet another pamphlet against the media, the author chooses to focus on the mechanisms and the processes of our mediated society. The basis of his analysis is that the opposite of reality is not phony or superficial, it is optional. We choose between options to determine who we are, to make statements to the world about who we are. People, he argues, have always done so, but the difference with today's situation is that we have a lot more options. In terms of options, comparing the modern world with the post-modern world is like comparing a breeze with a hurricane. The media forces at work since the fifties have contributed to expanding our options greatly, making the self \\"aware\\" of the possibilities to be who it deems worth being. We have become method actors, constantly flattered. Deception is luring because it is the inherent condition of the \\"flattered-self\\". So we seek new ways of satisfying our selves. These are the true forces at work behind what de Zengotita calls the \\"virtual revolution\\". Reviews With Mediated, Thomas de Zengotita received critical acclaim outside his field of study. The Washington Post called it \\"A fine roar of a lecture about how the American mind is shaped by (too much) media\\". O, The Oprah Magazine stated \\"Reading (...) Mediated is like spending time with a wild, wired friend, the kind who keeps you up late and lures you outside your comfort zone with a speed rap full of brilliant notions\\".

These photographs are also taken in formal studio settings and venues of opportunity such as film stars' homes, film debut events, and commercial settings. The photos were taken by studio photographers for promotional purposes. Such stills consisted of posed portraits, used for public display or free fan handouts, which are sometimes autographed. They can also consist of posed or candid images taken on the set during production, and may include stars, crew members or directors at work. The main purpose of such publicity stills is to help studios advertise and promote their new films and stars. Studios therefore send those photos along with press kits and free passes to as many movie-related publications as possible so as to gain free publicity. Such photos were then used by newspapers and magazines, for example, to write stories about the stars or the films themselves. Hence, the studio gains free publicity for its films, while the publication gains free stories for its readers.  Types  Shots can be taken as part of the filming or separately posed. During the course of filming, the still photographer takes shots of on- stage scenes. These photographs are called production stills. Another type of still generated during filming is the off-stage shot. The photographer takes these while actors are between takes, still in costume. Separately posed stills include a wide variety of shots. Many of these have self-explanatory designations: seasonal gag shots, leg art, fashion stills, commercial tie-ups, poster art, clinch shots (special posing for print advertising) candids (done normally with one source lighting—think snapshot) and in-costume studies (most economically done off-stage in a sound stage corner or more formally in a studio setting). By far the most popular of these many kinds of film stills are those portraying glamour, menace or gag interpretations. Other separately posed images include “set” stills, make-up stills and wardrobe stills. These stills are used for matching from scene to scene, or for recreating a scene later for a re-take. All details of the set, the costume and the cast make-up have to be exact, and these stills serve as a useful resource to get that accomplished. Background “plates” or “stereos” (not a reference to stereoscopic 3D, but to large-format stereopticon 2D slide projection), another type of still, enable the studio to create location scenes without leaving the premises, thus reducing the ultimate cost of production.Still Photography in the Motion Picture Industry Ned Scott, 1943 (See scanned article on page) Still photographers Movie still photography is considered a separate branch of movie making, that of marketing: \\"a still photographer usually works on set but is not directly involved in the making of a film. His role is to publicize, through his pictures, film and actors on magazines, newspapers and other media.\\"Ferrari, Angelo. PROCEEDINGS 4th International Congress on “Science and Technology for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage in the Mediterranean Basin” VOL. I, (2009) p. 355 Film producer and cinematographer Brian Dzyak explains that the group of people who work on a film are referred to as the \\"company\\" or \\"unit.\\" Among the professionals who are assigned to the unit, one is a \\"unit still photographer,\\" whose job is to take still photos that the studios will later use for marketing. They may take photos during rehearsals or while standing next to the cameraman during filming of takes.Dzyak, Brian. What I Really Want to Do on Set in Hollywood, Random House (2008) p. 303-304 For glamour publicity stills, given out to the public and press to promote a particular star, \\"special shoots\\" are made in separate studios, containing controlled lighting, backgrounds, clothing and furnishings.Jones, Chris. The Guerilla Film Makers Handbook Continuum International Publishing Group (2006) p. 345 Although the still photographer shares a number of skills and functions with the cinematographer, their work is essentially very different. The cinematographer is concerned with filming short scenes that will later be edited into an entire movie. The still photographer is primarily concerned with capturing dramatic photos that will draw attention when used on posters, DVD covers, and advertising.Editors of Photopreneur. 99 Ways TO Make Money From Your Photos, New Media Entertainment, Ltd. (2009) p. 294 Studios would therefore assign a still photographer to a production, and in some cases as many as five still photographers worked on the same film. Some stars, including Rita Hayworth, chose which photographer they wanted, in her case, Robert Coburn. Other notable still photographers were George Hurrell and Clarence Bull, known for being Greta Garbo's chosen photographer.Pepper, Terence, and Kobal, John. The Man Who Shot Garbo, Simon and Schuster (1989)Heritage Vintage Movie Photography & Stills Auction #7003, Heritage Auctions (2009) Katharine Hepburn recalls her feelings when he also photographed her: Purposes A pile of film stills The major and minor film studios have always used still photos of stars, typically in a posed portrait, to send to the media to create \\"a buzz\\" for both their stars and any new films they were appearing in. Studios \\"sent out tens of thousands of scene stills and portraits to newspapers, magazines, and fans each year. Such photographs were rarely marked with the photographer's name or with a credit line.\\"Hollywood glamour, 1924-1956, Elvehjem Museum of Art, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison (1987) Accordingly, the studio publicity departments used the stills \\"to sell a product,\\" namely, a \\"particular film or an individual actor or actress.\\" The distinction is relevant: \\"While the scene stills and on-the-set candid shots would be used to sell the movie, the portraits could be used to introduce a would-be star to an international audience. . . . The portrait photographer's function was to create and sell the image created by a publicity department around the life and look of a real person.\\" The photos portrayed a star \\"without a role to hide behind. . . [and the photographer] had to recognize the image which would serve as the essence of a lengthy publicity campaign, capturing it in a fraction of a second.\\" The glamour close-up would become \\"Hollywood's principal contribution to still portraiture.\\" Beyond basic publicity purposes, film stills were given to the actors themselves to send, signed or unsigned, to their fans and fan clubs. At various special events, stars might bring along a stack of these studio photos to sign in the presence of admirers, much like book signings by authors today. In addition, directors and casting directors involved with placing appropriate actors in the film roles still rely on film stills to help them recall the detailed looks of actors. This is similar to the way magazine or TV advertisers rely on stills taken of professional models. Typically, a film still included a separate profile sheet describing the physical details of the actor along with a brief bio. The directors would then collect their best choices and schedule interviews and auditions.Kobal, John. Movie-star portraits of the forties: 163 glamor photos, Dover Publ., 1977 Artistic significance Maxine Ducey, film archive director, has summarized the significance and contributions of the early film stills to the film industry: Copyright =United States= Public domain Publicity photo of Nanette Fabray in 1950 As explained by film production manager Eve Light Honthaner,Ms. Honthaner has held production management positions at Orion Pictures and Dream works and taught at USC School of Cinematic Arts.

In 2007, media lawyer Nancy Wolff,Ms. Wolff represents many media companies and has lectured widely on copyright issues Website of Law firm of CDAS She is the author of The Professional Photographer's Legal Handbook wrote with respect to the \\"photo archive of entertainment industry publicity pictures, historic still images widely distributed by the studios to advertise and promote their then new releases\\": > It has been assumed that these images are most likely in the public domain > or owned by studios that freely distributed the images without any > expectation of compensation.

Although Warner Bros. argued otherwise, the court found that these stills did not share the films' valid copyrights, and that the images' dissemination constituted general publication without notice. Other arguments related to derivative uses of the images were upheld, and an injunction against X One X was granted because certain \\"products combining extracts from the public domain materials in a new arrangement infringe the copyright in the corresponding film\\". The decision quoted from Nimmer on Copyright, which explains that, while films were generally registered for copyright protection, \\"much less care was typically exercised during production and in the publicity office\\" with photographs taken of the actors on set being \\"sent off to newspapers before the film’s release, in order to generate a buzz about its opening.\\"Warner Bros.

It focuses on the development of urban life in New York City from the Gilded Age to the Jazz Age as told through a series of overlapping individual stories. It is considered to be one of Dos Passos' most important works. The book attacks the consumerism and social indifference of contemporary urban life, portraying a Manhattan that is merciless yet teeming with energy and restlessness. The book shows some of Dos Passos' experimental writing techniques and narrative collages that would become more pronounced in his U.S.A. trilogy and other later works. The technique in Manhattan Transfer was inspired in part by James Joyce's Ulysses (1922), T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, and bears frequent comparison to the experiments with film collage by Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein.

The sequence which a phad vacno (performance) follows can be summarized as follows: # Purificatory rites are carried out before setting up the phad, which include sweeping the ground beneath the phad clean and burning incense sticks. # The phad is set by fastening the rope that runs through the red band sewn on at the top to wooden poles set at each end. # The Bhopa wears the special costume, known as baga. # Grains and money are offered for consecrating the phad. # The deities, whose images are depicted at the top of the phad are invoked. # The Bhopa begins prosimetric narration of the epical narrative which consists of verse sections, known as gavs and followed by prose sections known as arthavs (explanations). The gavs consist of a number of karis (couplets).

It was formed shortly after Booker T (who would become known as King Booker) won the King of the Ring tournament in mid-2006. King Booker would dub his wife Queen Sharmell and was joined by WWE Superstars from the United Kingdom: William Regal of England (renamed Sir William Regal) and Finlay of Northern Ireland (renamed Sir Finlay). In November, the court disbanded, however, with another return in December without Regal.  History  Prior to Booker T becoming \\"King Booker\\", he would often enlist the aid of Finlay to do his dirty work for him. The King's Court was unofficially founded on the May 26, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, when King Booker had his Coronation Ceremony, celebrating his King of the Ring tournament final victory at Judgment Day over Bobby Lashley. The ceremony was led by William Regal, playing the role of a town crier and repeatedly shouting \\"All hail King Booker!\\" as Booker walked to the ring. Sharmell was anointed by King Booker as his Queen, and Finlay joined the group to help Booker continue to feud with Lashley. King Booker would soon end his feud with Lashley after losing to him in a steel cage match for Lashley's WWE United States Championship. He then became the number one contender for Rey Mysterio's World Heavyweight Championship after winning a battle royal. Finlay would go on to defeat Lashley during this time to take Lashley's United States Championship. At The Great American Bash pay-per-view, King Booker became the World Heavyweight Champion, defeating Rey Mysterio with help from the heel turn of Chavo Guerrero. The Great American Bash also saw Finlay take on Regal in a one-on-one match for the United States Championship with Finlay coming out victorious with help from the Little Bastard. These events repeated themselves via rematches on the July 28 episode of SmackDown!, at first making it unclear whether Regal or Finlay had turned face, or whether they would even remain in the King's Court. At SummerSlam, King Booker would lose to Batista by disqualification, thus retaining the title and Finlay and William Regal, along with Mr. Kennedy (who later defeated Finlay for the United States Championship), the Spirit Squad and Big Show attacked D-Generation X during their match against Vince and Shane McMahon. On the August 25 episode of SmackDown!, the two members were \\"knighted\\" together – thus renaming them as \\"Sir\\" William Regal and \\"Sir\\" Finlay, as well as signalling the official founding of the King's Court – before teaming up with their King in a 3-on-2 handicap match against Lashley and Batista later that night, which they lost. Booker would later defeat Batista thanks to inference by Sir Finlay, who would continue to attack and bloody him afterward, igniting a feud between the two. The Court's issues with Bobby Lashley continued as he was set to take on Booker at No Mercy for the World Heavyweight Championship, however the SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long announced the match to be a fatal four-way match that also involved Finlay and Batista. On the October 6 edition of SmackDown!, Booker and Lashley were each able to pick the other's opponent for that night. Booker had to fight Finlay so he asked Finlay to be a good knight and lay down, but Finlay said that he never lays down for anybody. They went on to have the match, in which Finlay picked up the victory. Afterwards, they interfered in the Lashley vs. Batista match (Batista being the \\"poison\\" that King Booker picked). Following this, Theodore Long announced the previously mentioned four-way at No Mercy, and then booked Batista and Lashley vs. Finlay and King Booker. Finlay and King Booker, however, did not get along. At No Mercy, King Booker retained his title in the fatal-four-way match when he pinned Finlay after a Batista Bomb from Batista. Prior to the match, after failing at his task to get Finlay to be allies with Booker, King Booker called Regal pathetic and slapped him in the face. Regal could have no more so he punched Booker and walked away. After this 'incident', the court disbanded with Regal dropping the 'Sir' part of his name and going into the tag team division with partner Dave Taylor and Finlay taking on Booker and Batista in singles matches (with Booker losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Batista at Survivor Series). The court returned on the December 8 edition of SmackDown! (without Regal) when they attacked Batista in his match with Finlay with a chair and a shillelagh, leading to a tag team match at Armageddon with Batista choosing a mystery partner which turned out to be WWE Champion John Cena. Batista and Cena would win the match. Finlay and Booker would reunite in various tag team matches on SmackDown! as temporary allies since then. The April 6 episode of SmackDown! seemed to be the end of the court. King Booker attempted to take revenge on Matt Hardy for trying to set up Sharmell for a twist of fate in the Money in the Bank match at WrestleMania 23 (a match he lost). He lost the match to Hardy, however, and Sharmell berated him, declared him to be a disappointment and slapped him. Booker tried to impress her by attacking The Undertaker, but got a Tombstone Piledriver on the announce table. It was announced on WWE's official website that he suffered a sprain and strained contusion of the neck and would also be treated for his previous injuries of chronic knee pain, where he had a meniscus tear, and a chronic elbow strain and he would be out for several months. The court would then disband for the final time. During the 2007 WWE draft, Booker and Sharmell were drafted to the Raw brand and Regal also returned to Raw in a supplemental draft from SmackDown!, becoming the Raw General Manager in August. On October 16, 2007, it was officially announced on WWE's official website that Booker and Sharmell would be released from their contracts effective October 27, thus completely destroying any possibility of a reunion. However, Booker T returned to the WWE minus Sharmell in January 2011 in various roles since then.

Very early on, Powell's kites had spars made of ramin (Gonystylus) which were later replaced with aluminium tubing and, later still, by glass fibre spars. Originally they all came with black plastic sails, though later blue, red and yellow sails became available. The kites came with a long, hollow polyethylene tail that was inflated by the wind. The tail added stability as well as looking good when performing stunts. Early life He was born in Gloucester, England. at SO Glos online magazine Retrieved 5 January 2016 His parents toured with an Ideal Home Exhibition show and he served in the Royal Air Force where he trained as a mechanic and maintained Gloster Meteor aircraft. He then ran a business with his brother painting road markings. Kite production 300 kites a week were produced until a feature on the BBC News and current affairs television programme Nationwide, production then increased to 25,000 a week. Two factories were opened, followed by a further three with production reaching 75,000 a week.Peter Powell at BBC News Gloucester Retrieved 5 January 2016 Powell won the silver diploma for his kite at the Exhibition of New Inventions and Techniques in Geneva in 1975. In 1976, the Peter Powell kite was elected toy of the year by the British Association of Toy Retailers. Millions of kites were sold and flying steerable kites became a craze in the mid-70's in the UK. The popularity of all types of multiple-line kite flying today can be attributed directly to Powell's development of a modern dual-line kite. Powell often took his kites around the country and sold them from the back of his car. In 1974 (approx) he was selling them on Paignton sea front. He advertised by simply flying the kites. Powell launched a MKIII version of the kite with his sons Mark and Paul and on 14 June 2014 their first Kite store opened at the Cheltenham Shopping Centre.Kite King Peter Powell opens new store Cheltenham .

Biquandles take, in the theory of virtual knots, the place that quandles occupy in the theory of classical knots. Biracks and racks have the same relation, while a biquandle is a birack which satisfies some additional conditions. Definitions Biquandles and biracks have two binary operations on a set X written a^b and a_b . These satisfy the following three axioms: 1\\\\. a^{b c_b}= {a^c}^{b^c} 2\\\\. {a_b}_{c_b}= {a_c}_{b^c} 3\\\\. {a_b}^{c_b}= {a^c}_{b^c} These identities appeared in 1992 in reference [FRS] where the object was called a species. The superscript and subscript notation is useful here because it dispenses with the need for brackets. For example, if we write a*b for a_b and a**b for a^b then the three axioms above become 1\\\\. (a**b)**(c*b)=(a**c)**(b**c) 2\\\\. (a*b)*(c*b)=(a*c)*(b**c) 3\\\\. (a*b)**(c*b)=(a**c)*(b**c) If in addition the two operations are invertible, that is given a, b in the set X there are unique x, y in the set X such that x^b=a and y_b=a then the set X together with the two operations define a birack. For example, if X , with the operation a^b , is a rack then it is a birack if we define the other operation to be the identity, a_b=a . For a birack the function S:X^2 \\\\rightarrow X^2 can be defined by : S(a,b_a)=(b,a^b).\\\\, Then 1\\\\. S is a bijection 2\\\\. S_1S_2S_1=S_2S_1S_2 \\\\, In the second condition, S_1 and S_2 are defined by S_1(a,b,c)=(S(a,b),c) and S_2(a,b,c)=(a,S(b,c)). This condition is sometimes known as the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. To see that 1. is true note that S' defined by : S'(b,a^b)=(a,b_a)\\\\, is the inverse to : S \\\\, To see that 2. is true let us follow the progress of the triple (c,b_c,a_{bc^b}) under S_1S_2S_1 . So : (c,b_c,a_{bc^b}) \\\\to (b,c^b,a_{bc^b}) \\\\to (b,a_b,c^{ba_b}) \\\\to (a, b^a, c^{ba_b}). On the other hand, (c,b_c,a_{bc^b}) = (c, b_c, a_{cb_c}) .

Examples of switches are the identity, the twist T(a,b)=(b,a) and S(a,b)=(b,a^b) where a^b is the operation of a rack. A switch will define a birack if the operations are invertible. Note that the identity switch does not do this. Biquandles A biquandle is a birack which satisfies some additional structure, as described by Nelson and Rische. The axioms of a biquandle are \\"minimal\\" in the sense that they are the weakest restrictions that can be placed on the two binary operations while making the biquandle of a virtual knot invariant under Reidemeister moves.

He was legendary in his surgical abilities and style and brought many innovations to the Montreal Heart Institute after his post-graduate training with pioneers Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley in Houston, Texas. He was one of a select few heart surgeons worldwide who participated in the development of open heart surgery using the heart-lung machine in the early 1960s. He performed the first Canadian heart transplantation at the Montreal Heart Institute in May, 1968 shortly after the first successful heart transplant in the world in December, 1967 in Cape Town, South Africa by Dr. Christiaan Barnard.  Education and career  Grondin was awarded a Doctor of Medicine degree from the Université Laval in 1951, after which he went on to obtain a specialist’s certificate in cardiac surgery and a fellowship from the American College of Surgeons in San Francisco in 1960. He began his career as a surgeon at the Hôpital Ste-Marie de Trois-Rivières. In 1971, he joined the faculty of medicine of the Université de Montréal as clinical professor. After nearly 15 years as head of its surgical division, Dr. Pierre Grondin left the Montreal Heart Institute in 1978 to occupy the same position as head of cardiothoracic surgery at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach, Florida. He would return to Canada in 1990 to start a cardiac surgery program at the Hotel-Dieu Hospital in Quebec City and in 1995, at the age of 70, retired.  Achievements and later life  Dr. Grondin was one of the pioneers in cardiovascular and thoracic surgery in his locale. In collaboration with other surgeons, he organized the surgery department at the Montreal Heart Institute; he was the department's head from 1963 to 1975. During this time, he was appointed Honorary Professor of the Faculty of Medicine of Santo Domingo. He was also responsible for agreements between the Université de Montréal and its counterparts in Liège and Madrid. In the course of his career, he became the recipient of several prominent awards, including the Prix Lenègre from the Fondation Nativelle in France, and the Order of Canada medal. In May 1968, at the Montreal Heart Institute, he performed the first successful heart transplant in Canada. To date, over 300 cardiac transplants have been performed at the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI). Through Grondin's leadership, the MHI built a surgical team that is now known worldwide for its expertise in cardiovascular pathology and its commitment to research and teaching. Grondin died in Shawinigan, Quebec on January 17, 2006 of an esophageal rupture at the age of 80. He is survived by his 5 children: Louis, Jean, Marie-Pierre, Bernard, and Michel.

It became part of the Vale Academy Trust in January 2017. It collaborates with Abingdon's two other state secondary schools and the Further Education College to provide a wider range of sixth form options. Larkmead was rated by Ofsted as \\"Good\\" in February 2015. The current Ofsted report for Larkmead can be downloaded through the school's web site by selecting the Ofsted Report link provided on its About Us page. The school maintains a Twitter feed to provide information on current events and notifications, including publication of Open Days, on its Welcome page.  History  At the close of the war in 1945, and the introduction of primary and secondary education under R.A. Butler's Education Act 1944, Abingdon borough decided that a larger school was desperately needed. The names Larkhill and Willowside were originally suggested for the school, but in the end the name 'Larkmead' was settled upon. The school's buildings were completed by Easter 1956, and on Friday 8 June the school was officially opened by Sir John Douglas Cockcroft. Several additions were made to the school over the coming years, including a Kitchen (1958), a Caretaker's bungalow and Swimming Pool (1960) and a new Design Technology building (1969). In 1972, with the school preparing for comprehensive status, it was deemed necessary to update and extend the school's buildings. A new collection of buildings were built away from the main teaching areas to house the administrative centre of the school, where the Office and Learning Resource Centre were situated. Since its inception the school has made several new additions to its buildings, including a Music Centre with a performance room and several practice and technology rooms, which is now shared by the Abingdon Music Centre. Following an electrical storm and consequent lightning strike in the summer of 2017, the school's infrastructure sustained notable damage, and there are a number of parallel initiatives ongoing to both repair and improve the facilities at the school.  Performance  The performance of a school is officially determined by government policy as it stands at any point in time.

It is located in Tromsø, Norway, and is housed at the University of Tromsø. CASTL was founded by a core group of internationally respected linguists in Tromsø, and the funding made available by the Norwegian Research Council has since enabled the Center to more than double its staff size. Objectives The center's objective is to explore the limits and nature of linguistic variation, focusing mainly on syntax and phonology but also branching into morphology and semantics. All natural languages are of relevance to this study. The center has been exploring a methodology which can be referred to as \\"Selective Global Comparison,\\" an approach in which a relatively small number of unrelated languages are examined in depth in order to determine the nature of the variation which distinguishes them. This methodology is distinct from usual work in linguistic typology, which tends to compare many languages at a relatively superficial level of description, and from microcomparative studies, which tend to compare closely related languages at a level of great detail. Organizational structure At any given time there are about twenty to twenty-five doctorate holding linguists working on CASTL-related projects in Tromsø. There are also twelve to fifteen PhD students and some number of Master's students. In addition, CASTL is the center of a broad international network of current linguistic research, for example as the administrative host of the NORMS project (a Nordic Center of Excellence in Microcomparative Scandinavian Syntax) and the EGG school and other international ventures. It is therefore one of the largest centers dedicated to theoretical linguistic research in the world. Recent Research Recent research at CASTL has focused on (among other things) the nature of grammatical linguistic categories and their relationship to functional structure, the structure of inventories of phonological segments, and the nature of verb movement.

It was merged to the International X-ray Observatory around 2008, but as that project ran into issues in 2010, the ESA component was forked off into Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA). XEUS consisted of a mirror spacecraft that carried a large X-ray telescope, with a mirror area of about 5 m² and an imaging resolution better than 5″ for X-ray radiation with an energy of 1 keV. A detector spacecraft would have flown in formation with the telescope at a distance of approximately 35 m, in the focus of the telescope. The detectors would have included a wide-field X-ray imager with an energy resolution of 150 eV at 6 keV, as well as a cryogenic narrow-field imager with an energy resolution of 2 eV at 1 keV. XEUS would have been able to measure the X-ray spectrum and thereby the composition, temperature and velocities of hot matter in the early universe. It would address diverse questions like the origin and nature of black holes, their relation with star formation, the evolution of baryons and the formation of the heavy elements in the Universe.

The Anti- Atlas extends from the Atlantic Ocean in the southwest toward the northeast, to the heights of Ouarzazate and further east to the city of Tafilalt, altogether a distance of approximately 500 km. The range borders on the Sahara to the south.\\"Anti-Atlas\\" (or Jebel Saghru), The Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910. In some contexts, the Anti-Atlas is considered separate from the Atlas Mountains system, as the term \\"anti\\" implies. Geography The summits of the Anti-Atlas reach average heights of , with a few peaks reaching higher. To the north lies a plateau at 1700-1800 m in height. To the south lie the Sahara highlands at approximately 700 m. On the heights of Ouarzazate, the massif is cut through by the Draa valley, opening towards the south. The range is strongly fissured, particularly in a southerly direction. The Anti-Atlas area is a traditionally Berber region, inhabited by the Chleuh group. It is sparsely inhabited and there are no large cities in the area. The main town is Tafraoute, which has been described as \\"Morocco's Berber heartland\\".Tafraoute: Morocco's Berber heartland There are cave paintings in certain areas of the range.Alain Rodrigue, L'art rupestre au Maroc : les sites principaux. p. 19 =Subranges= The eastern prolongation of the Anti-Atlas is the Jbel Saghro range. The Jbel Sirwa is its northern prolongation, connecting with a section of the High Atlas range. The summit of Jbel Sirwa, of volcanic origin, reaches 3304 m. The Jbel Bani is a much lower range running along the southern side of the Anti Atlas.Des Montagnes du Sarho aux dunes de Merzouga Jebel Sirwa, highest point in the Anti-Atlas range. = Origins= The basement rock of Africa (the African plate) was formed in the Precambrian (approximately 450 to 550 million years ago), and is much older than the Atlas mountains. The Anti- Atlas range developed even later. The Anti-Atlas range formed in the Paleozoic (~300 million years ago), as a result of continental collisions. North America, Europe and Africa were connected as part of two former continents, Euramerica and Gondwana, which ground against one another to create the former Central Pangean Mountains. Evidence shows that the Anti-Atlas mountains were originally formed as part of the Alleghenian orogeny that also formed the Appalachians, formed when Gondwana (including Africa) and Euramerica (America) collided. There are indications they were once a chain of mountains far higher than the Himalayas are today. The Ameln valley More recently, in the Paleogene and Neogene Periods (66 million to ~1.8 million years ago), the remaining mountain chains that today comprise the Atlas were uplifted as the land masses of Europe and Africa collided at the southern end of the Iberian peninsula. Erosion continued to reduce the Anti-Atlas range so that it is today less massive than the High Atlas range to the north. =Climate = In the Anti- Atlas, the precipitation annually is typically below 200 mm, while the climatic conditions on the north and west slopes are locally more wet and agriculturally favorable. Climatically, the mountains are separated from the Mediterranean's influence by the High Atlas to its north, and therefore they belong to the Saharan climate zone. The driest area is the Jbel Saghro.Sud- Maroc; Massif aux paysages lunaires = Flora = In the least dry areas to the west and the north, much of the land is covered with thyme, rosemary and other low-water-demand plants, such as argan. The quilt-like cover is endangered by overgrazing, and in the south little but thorn shrubs remain. The transition to the desert is gradual towards the south. The Moroccan citron is growing there, and uses as Jewish Etrog. Human geography  The Anti- Atlas area is a traditionally Berber region, inhabited by the Chleuh group. It is sparsely inhabited and there are no large cities in the area. The main town is Tafraoute, which has been described as \\"Morocco's Berber heartland.\\" Often the distances between one village and another are great, without any human presence in between. There are Neolithic cave paintings in certain areas of the range. Village in the Anti-Atlas The landscape of the Anti-Atlas is marked by picturesque kasbah (small castles) in many places in the region. In former times, the kasbah was important as a place of shelter and as a supply depot for kinsmen. Close to these settlements, terraced fields with dry-stone retaining walls cover the landscape. However, increasingly houses are vacated and fields are left uncultivated. With the continued migration from the land, the irrigation systems necessary for agriculture are also decaying. =Panoramic view=  See also  * Tata Notes References * \\"Anti- Atlas\\" (or Jebel Saghru), The Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910.

John Ketcham John Ketcham (September 10, 1782 – February 5, 1865) was an American self-taught surveyor, building contractor and judge. Early years John was the son of Daniel Ketcham and Keziah Pigmon Lewis and born in Washington County, Maryland. His father signed the Patriot's Oath of Allegiance in 1778.Crothers, Bessie S., Oaths of Fidelity to Maryland, vol. 1, Chesterfield, Missouri, (no date) p. 60. In May, 1784 the Ketchams left Maryland to Louisville, Kentucky eventually settling near Shelbyville, Kentucky where John spent his early years.Brumbaugh, Gaius M., and Hodges, Margaret R., Revolutionary Records of Maryland, Part I, Washington 1924.Early Kentucky Tax Records: From the Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, Baltimore 1984, p. 94 & 242. Native fighting From 1809 through 1818 fighting Native Americans was almost an everyday occurrence with the few settlers in south central Indiana. In 1811, Ketcham moved to Fort Vallonia.Esarey, Logan; Readings in Indiana History, Indiana University, 1914 Ketcham's Fort was built on Ketcham's land and lay between Huff's fort and the Fort Vallonia in what is now Jackson County making it of vital importance for settlers for security and safety prior to and after the Treaty of Grouseland. Most of the fighting between settlers and Indians took place from 1812 to 1813. In his own words: In Jackson County Col. John Ketcham, founding father of Brownstown, gained both fame and fortune from his Indian hunting escapades performed as a young man in this very area. His father was the hero of a hair raising adventure as an Indian captive. Col. John accumulated titles during his lifetime that yet today make any man envious of his reputation. Among them were colonel, judge honorable (from serving the State Legislature), and he was also a self-taught surveyor and building contractor. One of his most highly prized titles, however, was that of one of Gen. Andrew Jackson's electors. He also was listed as one of the first trustees of Indiana University. The Ketcham family can trace its history back to 1590 when the original Edward Ketcham was born in England. He emigrated to America in 1629 and the Ketchams remained in the East until a great grandson of Edward, Daniel Ketcham, came to the West in 1784, settling in Shelby Co., Ky. Daniel was the father of Col. John Ketcham and eight other children. John was two years old when his father made the trip to Kentucky and has mentioned the journey in his memoirs. He was said to have told his story about the trip: \\"When coming down the Ohio river on a raft, a wildcat was spotted on a tree branch over-hanging the river, was shot and it fell before me on the boat.\\" Though John's father was presented with 1,400 acres of land by the government in Shelby County, Ky., things were not to be easy for him and his family. In 1792, Daniel was carried away by a band of Tawa (Ottawa) Indians who led him on a march lasting several days. The Indians forced Daniel to many hardships carrying full pack while marching through the wilds and fording rivers. After several days of this, Daniel pretended to be injured and began limping. The Indians relieved him of his pack and he proceeded easier. However, while crossing a log bridge, he ran and forgot to hobble. The Indians noticed and immediately loaded him with all he could bear. Eventually the group came to a large camp near Detroit. Daniel was kept prisoner until, one day, the Indians led him to a stake where a fire had been prepared. He was blackened and made ready to die in the fire when an Indian maiden decorated with \\"fully 500 silver broaches,\\" came forth, denounced the group and took the man to herself. She cared for him until later, he was able to escape the tribe and made his way into Canada, then back to his original home in Maryland. Finally he was able to return to Kentucky. It was said his wife and family there never had given up hope for his return. His wife, when he had been captured, kept the neighbors from pursuing the Indian group lest Daniel be the victim of a tomahawk death, for she believed that God, in His Providence, would bring him back to her. Two years later Daniel returned. In 1803, John Ketcham was married in Kentucky to Elizabeth Pearsy. They had 12 children, six were born in Kentucky and six were born in the Indiana Territory, for in 1811 the family traveled to Indiana and settled in Jackson County, very near to the property that later John sold to the county. The area still was overrun with Indians, some of whom professed friendliness. But most of them were unhappy over the constant pushing westward and northward they were receiving by the signing of treaties with the white men. The Ten O'Clock Treaty, signed in 1809, and the Treaty of Grouseland, signed in 1805, formed a perfect triangular boundary, of which this area was in the southernmost part. With forts in Vincennes, Terre Haute and Fort Wayne, the area was not particularly well guarded. But, eventually the Indians were to be forced from it. During the period from 1809 through 1818, Indian fighting was an everyday occurrence with the few settlers in the area that braved the wild and hostile Indian tribes. Temporary forts were built to allow the homesteaders to clear and till the soil and find safety at night inside the protecting walls of the forts. They were built on a line south of just south of Vallonia through Brownstown and on toward the east. The Vallonia fort was manned with 100 troops of the territory militia and afforded protection nearby to the other small forts on up the way. Ketcham's Fort was located on or near the spot where the Asher Woodmansee home now stands and was occupied by a few brave families. Only the other fort, Huff's Fort, lay between Ketcham and Vallonia all that time. Col. Ketcham became one of the fiercest Indian fighters in this area of the Indiana Territory. Some of his escapades are well worth retelling here, most of the information coming from memoirs that the colonel wrote himself a few years before his death in 1865. Most of the action took place during the years of 1812–1813. The troubled area, as he put it, was in that portion of the Indiana Territory, commonly called the \\"Forks,\\" situated between the Muscatatuck and Driftwood fork of the White River. The Indians were numerous and friendly in that area before the Tippecanoe battle in 1811. However, the Delaware tribe expressed disapproval of the battle and many left the territory then, but several remained, enough that white settlers were not without fear. Constant harassment was given the white settlers with occasional murder and horse thievery being committed by the Indians, but no large battles with the whites. In April, 1812, Ketcham recalled a white man was murdered near Ketcham's fort and the colonel and another man retrieved the body, found stripped and thrown in the river. The next day, three Indians came to Ketcham's door. They could speak pretty good English, and the colonel asked them what was new. They replied, \\"None.\\" Ketcham asked them to accompany him to the site of the murder. They agreed. However, Ketcham's wife begged him not to go with them as did his children. When they had gotten a mile or so away, the Indians said they would go no farther as it would make the white men mad. So they returned to Ketcham's place to find his wife and children had vanished. They had expected an ambush from the Indians and had hidden in the forest. When some other white men saw the Indians they drove them off. About 10 days afterward, there came two Indians with white flags and a note from the Delaware tribe that the trouble had been caused by the Kickapoo tribe, and was not the Delaware. The two Indian messengers stayed on in the fort working for the white men after the peaceful settlement. There were nearly 70 families in the forts at that time, but, after several more murders, about 50 families left and went back to Kentucky to safer territory. The balance of 15 or 18 families were determined not to leave and had built blockhouses for protection. For a time, life continued unchanged, with the Indians stealing horses from within 15 steps of the white men and ambushing the settlers at every chance. On one occasion, the Indians had slipped into the white man's camp and stole some horses. Upon being discovered the settlers gave pursuit to the fleeing Indians and John Ketcham, while directing the chase, was shot. Shortly after this episode, he enlisted for two years in the territory militia. He fought under Gen. John Tipton and participated in many Indian battles, including the one on Tipton's Island, which got its name from the Indian fights there with Tipton's men. Ketcham killed and scalped an Indian on his first trip out with the troops and became at once to be known as a brave Indian fighter. He was carried on the muster roll as First Sergeant. On one campaign he was away from home for 88 days and lived on a week's simple rations. He was a ranger in the militia and received a dollar a day in pay, \\"sustaining himself\\" as he put it, which meant finding his own food to eat and clothes to wear. After Gen. Tipton's rough treatment of the Indians at the battle of Tipton's Island, Ketcham said, the Indians retreated and were more wary of their new neighbors. Ketcham was released from the service in 1815 and returned to his home in Jackson County. Two humorous tales he told about his service concerned fording a creek on horseback. The creek was flooded and difficult to cross. He and his friend's horses became mired and stuck fast in the mud. The friend, Jack Storm, had his name attached to the creek and it remains so to this day as Jack's Defeat in Monroe County. The stream empties into Beanblossom creek, which also got its name from a man named Beanblossom who, while riding with General Tipton, almost drowned while crossing the stream. Tipton named the creek Beanblossom which is very familiar to everyone who has been to Brown County. After Ketcham's discharge from the service, he was honored by Gov. William Henry Harrison with rank of colonel in a regiment of the state's militia. He also was presented a tract of land and named one of General Andrew Jackson's electors for 1836 Presidential election. In 1816, before he left Jackson county, he sold to the county government 153.4 acres of ground for 8 dollars per acre, donating the block of land where the Jackson County courthouse now stands for as long as it was used for a courthouse. He also helped lay out the town of Brownstown, the location of which was picked because of its central geographical location in the county. In 1818, Col. Ketcham moved to Monroe County, six or seven miles from Bloomington near Ellettsville. He built a grist mill on Clear Creek the first year and became known far and wide for his service. When the city of Bloomington was laid out in 1818, Ketcham was asked to design and contract for building of the first courthouse there. He became known for his kindness and generosity, and was said to never have turned down a request from a poor family member or traveler at his door. He was elected to the Indiana Legislature, received a judgeship from General Harrison, was appointed a trustee of the Indiana Seminary, and served as colonel in the Twentieth Regiment of the state militia. He also established the Ketcham cemetery in Bloomington where today his remains are buried. He and a co-worker establish a Methodist religious school on grounds at the south end of College Avenue in Bloomington. It was a frame building 30 by 60 feet and later enlarged. It could be said that he was the first trustee of Indiana University, then Indiana Seminary and the Indiana Pioneer Historical Society lists him that way. A chapel was built on the I.U. campus totally financed by the official I.U. chaplain, F.O. Beck and his wife, Daisy Ketcham Beck. Stone used in the building was quarried from Col. John's original farm to make the project more realistic. In 1815, Ketcham was released from the service and returned to his home in Jackson County. He was honored by Gov. William Henry Harrison with rank of colonel in a regiment of the state's militia. In 1816, before he left Jackson county, he sold to the county government of ground for 8 dollars per acre, donating the block of land where the Jackson County Courthouse now stands for as long as it was used for a courthouse. In, 1816 Ketcham received a judgeship from General William Henry Harrison and remained in that position until 1817. In Monroe County In 1818, Col. Ketcham moved to Monroe County six or from Bloomington near Victor and Harrodsburg. He built a gristmill on Clear Creek the first year and became known far and wide for his service. When the city of Bloomington was laid out in 1818, Ketcham was asked to design and contract for building of the first courthouse there. In 1836, Ketcham was named one of General Andrew Jackson's electors for the Presidential election of that year. He served in the Indiana House of Representatives.http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/kerrey-keydel.html Ketcham was later appointed a trustee of the Indiana Seminary which would become Indiana University. Ketcham and a co-worker established a Methodist religious school on grounds at the south end of College Avenue in Bloomington. Col. John is buried in the Ketcham family cemetery in Monroe County. The family cemetery is still maintained by family members. In popular culture Ketcham features in The Amityville Horror films and books as a reason why the house at 112 Ocean Avenue is haunted and why Ronald DeFeo Jr. killed his family. Both the film and book say that Ketcham moved from Salem and into Amityville; Ketcham—in the 1979 and 2005 films—was said to have killed multiple native Americans and himself in a secret part of the house—in the basement. http://truelegends.info/amityville/amityville.htm The extract from the novel states:  Sources  External links *Ft.

The style of his work – refined but vigorous compared to the work of contemporaries – has earned him a place in the pantheon of the best of 20th- century graphic designers. In acknowledging his power as a propagandist, he claimed, \\"I wind the spring and the public, in looking at the poster, will have that spring released in its mind.\\" Because of the length of his career – over six decades – his work is essentially a record of the era's social history. Some of Britain's most iconic images include those by Games. An example is the \\"Join the ATS\\" poster of 1941, nicknamed the \\"blonde bombshell\\" recruitment poster. His work is recognised for its \\"striking colour, bold graphic ideas, and beautifully integrated typography\\". Early life and career Born Abraham Gamse in Whitechapel, London on 29 July, the day after World War I began in 1914, he was the son of Joseph Gamse, a Latvian photographer, and Sarah, nee Rosenberg, a seamstress born on the border of Russia and Poland. His father, who had emigrated to Britain in 1904, anglicised the family name to Games when Abram was 12. Games left Hackney Downs School at the age of 16 and, in 1930, went to Saint Martin's School of Art in London. Disillusioned by the teaching at Saint Martin's and worried about the expense of studying there, Games left after two terms. However, Games was determined to establish himself as a poster artist so while working as a \\"studio boy\\" for the commercial design firm Askew-Young in London between 1932 and 1936, he attended night classes in life drawing. He was fired from this position due to his jumping over four chairs as a prank. In 1934, his entry was second in the Health Council Competition and, in 1935, won a poster competition for the London County Council. From 1936 to 1940, he worked on his own as a freelance poster artist. An article on him in the influential journal Art and Industry in 1937 led to several high-profile commissions for Games, from the General Post Office, London Transport, Royal Dutch Shell and others. World War Two Join the ATS (1941) Art.IWMPST2832 At the start of World War Two, Games was conscripted into the British Army. He served until 1941 when he was approached by the Public Relations Department of the War Office who were looking for a graphic designer to produce a recruitment poster for the Royal Armoured Corps. From 1942 Games's service as the Official War Artist for posters resulted in 100 or so posters. Games was allowed a great deal of artistic freedom which enabled him to produce many striking images, often with surrealist elements. Among his first designs was the Auxiliary Territorial Service recruitment poster that became known as the blonde bombshell. Games had wanted to challenge the rather drab image of the ATS but the authorities feared that the glamorous image he had produced would encourage young women to join the ATS for the \\"wrong reasons\\" and the poster was quickly withdrawn. The design Games replaced it with was criticised by Winston Churchill as being too \\"Soviet\\". Other notable posters included Your Talk May Kill Your Comrades (1942) in which a spiral symbolising gossip originates from a soldiers mouth to become a bayonet attacking three of his comrades. Games used the photographic techniques he had learnt from his father in that and other posters such as He Talked...They Died (1943) part of the Careless Talk campaign. In addition to his poster work, Games completed a number of commissions for the War Artists' Advisory Committee. Later in the War, Churchill ordered a poster Games had produced to be taken off the wall of the Poster Design in Wartime Britain exhibition at Harrods in 1943. The Army Bureau of Current Affairs, ABCA, had commissioned Games and Frank Newbould to produce posters for a series entitled Your Britain - Fight for It Now. While Newbould produced rural images similar to the pre-war travel posters he had created for several railway companies, Games presented a set of three Modernist buildings that had been built to address poverty, disease and deprivation. The poster that annoyed Churchill most featured the Berthold Lubetkin designed Finsbury Health Centre superseding a ruined building with a child suffering from rickets. Churchill considered this nothing short of a libel on the conditions in British cities and ordered the poster to be removed. Ernest Bevin, the war-time Minister of Labour, had another poster in the series removed from the Poster Design in Wartime Britain exhibition organised by the Association of International Artists. Later career The Festival of Britain emblem – the Festival Star – designed by Abram Games, from the cover of the South Bank Exhibition Guide, 1951 In 1946, Games resumed his freelance practice and worked for clients such Royal Dutch Shell, the Financial Times, Guinness, British Airways, London Transport and El Al. He designed stamps for Britain, Ireland, Israel, Jersey and Portugal. Also, he designed the logo for the JFS school. There were also book jackets for Penguin Books and logos for the 1951 Festival of Britain (winning the 1948 competition) and for the 1965 Queen's Award to Industry. Among his pioneering contributions was, in 1954, the first moving on-screen symbol of BBC Television. He also produced murals. Between 1946 and 1953, Games was a visiting lecturer in graphic design at London's Royal College of Art and in 1958, was awarded the OBE for services to graphic design. In 1959, he was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI). He also designed the tile motif of a swan on the Victoria line platforms at Stockwell tube station in the late 1960s. Games had been among the first in Britain to see evidence of the atrocities committed at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, when photographs taken there by British troops arrived at the War Office in 1945. The same year he produced a poster, Give Clothing for Liberated Jewry, and would often work to support Jewish and Israeli organisations. Games, who was Jewish, spent some time in Israel in the 1950s where, among other activities, he designed stamps for the Israeli Post Office, including for the 1953 Conquest of the Desert exhibition and taught a course in postage-stamp design. He also designed covers for The Jewish Chronicle and prayer book prints for the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain. In 1960 Games designed the poster known as Freedom from Hunger for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Games was also an industrial designer of sorts. Activities in this discipline included the design of the 1947 Cona vacuum coffee maker (produced from 1949, reworked in 1959 and still in production) and inventions such as a circular vacuum cleaner and an early 1960s portable handheld duplicating machine by Gestetner, which was not put into production due to the demise of mimeography. In arriving at a poster design, Games would render up to 30 small preliminary sketches and then combine two or three into the final one. In the developmental process, he would work small because, he asserted, if poster designs \\"don't work an inch high, they will never work.\\" He would also call on a large number of photographic images as source material. Purportedly, if a client rejected a proposed design (which seldom occurred), Games would resign and suggest that the client commission someone else. In 2013, the National Army Museum, London, acquired a collection of his posters, each signed by Games and in mint condition.

Personal life Blue plaque, 41 The Vale, Golders Green, London NW11 In October 1945, Games married Marianne Salfeld, the daughter of German orthodox Jewish émigrés, and initially lived with her father in Surbiton, Surrey. In 1948, they moved to north London, and lived in the same house until their deaths. They had three children, Naomi, Daniel and Sophie. Marianne died in 1988; Games died in London on 27 August 1996.

He lived in the 14th century in Rajasthan. He was one of four children of Dhadal Rathore of village Kolu, two boys (Buro and Pabuji) and two girls (Sona and Pema). The historical Pabuji was a mediaeval Rajput prince; he is now widely worshipped as a deity by Rajputs of Rajasthan, Rabari herdsmen and others throughout the Rajasthan countryside; and he is served by Nayak priests. Pabuji lived in the remote desert village of Kolu, and in that village are to be found the only well-known conventional temples to him—two small temples within a single compound, where puja (worship) is offered to the deity. Small shrines, commemorative stones etc. abound, but, outside Kolu itself, the absence of actual temples is conspicuous. There are two reasons for it: first, Pabuji has yet to achieve sufficient prestige as a god to warrant the construction of pieces of architecture; and, second, many of his worshippers—in particular, many Rabaris—are semi-nomadic, and are thus not in a position regularly to visit a temple in a fixed spot. Bhopa community in Rajasthan are considered to be priest singers of Pabuji. They depict the story of Pabuji on canvas and recite it to the public through religious songs. This painted canvas is called Phad. The Phad is a 30 feet long sheet on which are painted (or sewn) miniature scenes depicting the life of Pabuji on which his adventures are narrated. The Narrative of Pabuji The narrative of Pabuji is sung by the Bhopa poet-singers of Nayak community is based according to the tradition on a text, the Pabuprakasa. This text, according to the Bhopas consists of number of episodes of two different types, parvaros and sayls. The narrative of Pabuji is found in the Khyata of Muhanot Nainsi (17th century) under the title Vata Pabujiri. A panoramic view of the Pabhuji Ki Phad displayed in the Tropenmuseum, Amsterdam, Netherlands =Episodes of Pabuji= Dhadal Rathore had four children, two boys (Buro and Pabuji) and two girls (Sona and Pema). When he died, both his sons set up court in their village of Kolu; but Pabuji was a god incarnate, born not from Dhadal's wife but from a celestial nymph who had promised him that when he was twelve years old she would return to him in the form of a mare for him to ride. He had four companions: Chando and Dhebo, two brothers of whom Dhebo was a colossus with an insatiable appetite for food, drink and opium, and immensely aggressive; Salji Solanki the augurer; and Harmal the Rebari herdsman. Pabuji's first exploit was to fight the Khinchis, who were encroaching on his borders and treating him and Buro arrogantly. In the course of the fight Jindrav Khici's father was killed. To try to prevent a blood-feud Pabuji and Buro gave Khinchi their sister Pema in marriage. But in fact he remained hostile, and his hostility was brought to a head when Pabuji secured from the Caran lady Deval (an incarnation of the Goddess) the fine black mare Kesar Kalami, on whom Khici had set his heart. The mare was, of course, Pabuji's mother returned to him. In exchange for the mare, Pabuji promised to protect Deval from Khinchi's raids. Then he set off on his exploits: he overthrew Mirza Khan, the cow- killing king of Patan, and then went to bathe in the holy lake of Pushkar to cleanse himself of the sin of bloodshed. Whilst he was bathing his foot slipped, and he was saved from drowning by the snake-god Gogo Chauhan. As a reward Pabuji offered him the hand of his niece Kelam, Buro's daughter, and he accepted. But Kelam's parents were fiercely opposed to any such wedding, and so Pabuji set up a subterfuge instead. At his instigation, Gogo turned himself into a venomous snake and concealed himself in the garden; and when Kelam came there to swing he bit her on the little finger. The curers were unable to do anything for her, but Pabuji said that she could be cured by tying on her arm an amulet in Gogo's name, provided that she was then married to him. The cure worked and the wedding had to go ahead. During the wedding-ceremony various people gave costly presents to Kelam; when his turn came, Pabuji said, \\"I shall plunder she-camels from Ravana the demon king of Lanka to give you. Everyone laughed, for camels were then unknown in Rajasthan and Lanka was known to be impregnable. And when Kelam reached her husband's home her in-laws taunted her mercilessly. So she sent a letter to Pabuji imploring him to carry out his promise. He sent one of his men, Harmal Dewasi, to Lanka to reconnoitre; and Harmal, disguised as a jogi (holy man), managed to get the information they needed, and also obtained physical evidences of the she- camels, all this despite being mistrusted and ill treated by the inhabitants of Lanka. Then he returned to Kolu with his news, and they all set off to raid Lanka. They crossed the sea by Pabuji's power and rounded up Ravana's she- camels; then they did battle with Ravana and his army and defeated them, Pabuji himself killing Ravana with his spear. On their way to give the captured she-camels to Kelam they had to pass through Umarkot in Sindh, and here the Sodhi princess Phulvanti saw Pabuji and fell in love with him. Pabuji continued on his way: he triumphed in an encounter with Devnarayan, and was soon able to hand over the she-camels to a delighted Kelam and return home to Kolu. But now he received a wedding-proposal from Phulvanti's father. At first he tried to avoid it, and even when he capitulated and accepted it he caused further delay by insisting that saffron be obtained to dye the garments of the men who travelled in his wedding-procession—which resulted in an all-out war with Lakkhu Pathan, the owner of the saffron. But at last he set off back to Umarkot to be married. Deval, to whom he had promised his protection, stopped him on the way and tried to persuade him to stay, or at least to leave some of his men behind, but he refused, promising that if she needed him he would come instantly, even if he were sitting inside the wedding-pavilion. Then the wedding-procession started off once more, but as they travelled they observed numbers of bad omens, culminating in a tiger which Dhebo killed. They reached Umarkot, and the preparations for the wedding went ahead smoothly; but before the ceremony itself was even complete Deval arrived in the form of a bird to say that Khici had stolen her cattle. Pabuji insisted on abandoning the wedding in order to ride in pursuit: he severed the bridal knot with his sword, and gave his bride a parrot which would tell her what became of him. He rode back to Kolu with his men, and after some slight delay set out in pursuit of the Khicis, leaving only Dhebo behind asleep. Deval woke Dhebo up and sent him out too, and he soon overtook Pabuji, for when his horse tired from endless galloping, he picked it up and put it under his arm and ran on. Then disaster befell him. Vultures began to circle over him, and he as usual told them to be patient (\\"I shall satiate you with the vital organs of the Khicis!\\"); but these vultures were not content, and told him that they wished to eat his own flesh. Dhebo was a man of such noble character that he could refuse no request, so he disembowelled himself for the birds. Then he drew his belt tight, and rode on; and soon he caught up with Khici. Single-handed he destroyed Khici's whole army, until only Khici himself was left alive, and he was about to kill him too when Pabuji, who had arrived on the battlefield, stayed his hand: \\"If you kill him you make my sister Pema a widow.\\" They freed Khici, and set off to give Deval back her cattle. On the way, when Pabuji offered Dhebo some opium, Dhebo revealed that he was disembowelled, and died. Pabuji and his remaining men now returned the cattle to Deval, but she kept making objections: first she said her favourite bull-calf was missing—but it was discovered inside Dhebo's opium-box, where he had put it as a joke; then she complained that her cattle were thirsty and told Pabuji to water them—but when he tried to do so he found that all the water in the well had been swallowed on Deval's instructions by a genie named Susiyo Pir. He struck the genie through the head with his spear and watered the cattle; but by the time he had finished doing all this Khici had been able to enlist the support of his uncle Jaisingh Bhati, and was riding on Kolu with a Bhati army. There was a great battle, in which Pabuji and Khici came face to face. Pabuji said, \\"Khici, take my sword and give me your whip: my body cannot fall to a blow from your sword.\\" They exchanged weapons, but at first Khici did nothing; so Pabuji goaded him into fury by whipping him, and Khici struck back at him with the sword. Instantly, a palanquin came from heaven and took Pabuji away with his mare. After this, Pabuji's men were wiped out quickly, the last to fall being Buro, who had his head cut off by Khici. Buro's wife had a terrible dream in which she saw the massacre of the Rathors; and when she awoke the news was confirmed by the camel-rider Harmal Dewasi, who brought her the turban of her dead husband. Similarly in Umarkot Phulvanti heard the news from her parrot, which then died. Then all the women prepared to become satis (i.e. to follow their husbands into death by mounting the funeral pyre). But Buro's widow was advanced in pregnancy, and before becoming a sati she took a knife and cut out from her body a male child. She named him Rupnath, and had him sent to her mother's home in Girnar to be looked after. Rupnath grew up in ignorance of his origins, but one day when he was twelve years old he encountered Deval, and persuaded her to tell him the truth. Then he was consumed by desire to take revenge on Khici. In the disguise of a holy man ( gogo chauhan) he went to Khici's place, and his aunt Pema (Khici's wife) told him how to avoid the traps and savage animals with which Khici guarded himself. He was successful in doing this, and thus came into the room where Khici was asleep. He awoke him, told him who he was, and then beheaded him. Pema helped her nephew escape, and asked him for her husband's head, for her to commit Sati with. After playing with the head, Rupnath kicks Khici's head back to Pema. After killing Khici, Rupnath becomes a sage and meditates for the rest of his days. See also *List of Rajputs *Bhopa *Pabuji Ki Phad References # Smith, John D. (2005).

Early life and education Orr was born on 23 September 1962 to Winifred \\"Win\\" and John Orr, a factory worker. She was raised in Motherwell, Scotland. She had one brother. She attended Garrion Academy, Wishaw (which later merged with Wishaw High School to form Clyde Valley High School) and the University of St Andrews, from which she graduated with a degree in English in 1983. Career Orr worked as deputy editor for City Limits magazine, a workers' cooperative. Orr said later that she found the structure frustrating and requiring more listening. Until 1990, Orr was a contributor to New Statesman. In 1990, she began writing for The Guardian regularly. From 1993 to 1998, Orr was editor of the Guardian Weekend magazine. From 1998 until her death, Orr worked as a freelance journalist. She was also a columnist for The Independent. In January 2018, Orr's regular column for The Guardian ended when the newspaper relaunched in a tabloid format. In February 2018, she joined the i newspaper as a regular columnist.https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/award-winning- columnist-deborah-orr-dies-aged-57-1.4057682 In January 2020, Orr's memoir, Motherwell: A Girlhood, was published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson and serialised on BBC Radio 4.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000dpl9 Views Orr wrote, in 2017, \\"Homeless people are stuck in the streets once again. The services of food banks have never been more in demand. People with mental and physical illnesses or disabilities are dying for want of care, or even heat. The National Health Service has been plunged into a financial and staffing crisis, yet still has to soothe the dented ego of Richard Branson by making a payout to Virgin Care. The teaching profession is struggling once more with a rejigged exam system, and is bracing itself for a further squeeze on budgets. Our prison service is a series of riots waiting to happen.\\" On 19 October 2011, an article by Orr stated that the trade for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners \\"tacitly acknowledges what so many Zionists believe—that the lives of the chosen are of hugely greater consequence than those of their unfortunate neighbours.\\" This statement, viewed by many as anti-Semitic, was the subject of criticism. Orr apologised for words which she described as \\"badly chosen and poorly used\\". Her apology, too, was the subject of criticism. Personal life In 1997, Orr married English author Will Self. They had two sons and lived in Stockwell; they separated in 2017 and divorced in 2018. In 2010, she discovered she had breast cancer and was treated for it, which included a mastectomy. In October 2019, she died from the disease, aged 57. In 2017, Orr wrote about her struggles with complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

It premiered April 3, 2006 on the network and starred Eric Roberts as Joe, an ex- policeman turned casino pit boss in Atlantic City, and Anne Heche as Tanya Sullivan, a bored housewife with very manipulative ways. The film was based on, or \\"inspired by,\\" the true crime book Fatal Error by journalists Mark Morris and Paul Janczewski. The book in turn was based on the real life case against Sharee Miller. The film featured two original songs by New Orleans- based singer/songwriter Kristin Diable and marked the cable television premiere of her work. Tagline A dark, sexually charged true crime thriller about a perfect match that becomes a perfect nightmare. Plot Joe is a newly divorced, single dad in his forties living in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Though he makes a decent living working as a casino pit boss, and loves the time he is getting to spend with his son, he still longs to start a new relationship. So Joe decides to explore the world of online dating, and while in a chatroom meets a Pittsburgh woman in her twenties who calls herself \\"sexykitten.\\" After a few months of exchanging messages, they meet in person. When she arrives at the airport, Joe learns that her real name is Tanya Sullivan and Joe is instantly attracted to her. She also reveals that she is married and has a young daughter. However, both Joe and Tanya don't care. Through several months the relationship grows from hot, passionate sex, into what Joe believes is love. During those months, they continue meeting and Tanya sends Joe pornographic videos of herself. The relationship seems to be going great, until one day Tanya drops a bombshell. She's pregnant with what she believes is Joe's baby. After she tells Joe of her pregnancy, Joe tries to convince Tanya to leave her husband to come and live with him. But Tanya refuses the offer, saying her husband is very dangerous and would never let that happen. Meanwhile, Joe starts to receive threatening emails supposedly sent by Tanya's husband mocking him and saying he knows all about the affair. Joe asks Tanya to take pictures of the physical abuse that her husband allegedly causes. It's not long before another bombshell is dropped. Tanya tells him that because of her infidelity, her husband and his buddies have beaten her and raped her by the pool behind the house, in the process making her lose the baby, or so Joe thinks. At this point Joe can't take it anymore. With the blessing of Tanya, who provides directions, he plots and sets out to kill Tanya's husband at his auto repair shop where he succeeds in shooting him to death late one night. During the weeks following the murder, the relationship between Joe and Tanya disintegrates. She refuses to answer his emails and in fact deletes the file on her computer that contains his messages. So Joe decides to investigate. He travels to Pittsburgh again. There he figures out that everything that Tanya has been telling him is a lie. Tanya was never pregnant (Joe failed to notice an ultrasound tape given to him by Tanya during the supposed pregnancy was actually ten years old and had been recorded while Tanya was pregnant with her daughter). Her husband never abused her. There is no pool behind the house where she was allegedly raped. Meanwhile, she has refurnished the house with new furniture from her husband's life insurance policy. And worst of all, Tanya has a new boyfriend. Joe is devastated. He returns to Atlantic City where he falls into a deep depression. He starts to drink again, which results in Joe's son leaving to go live with his mom. Joe finally decides to take his own life. In his suicide note, Joe instructs his friend Paula to make sure a case under his bed gets to the police in Pittsburgh. Armed with the evidence Joe has left for them, the police arrest Tanya, and is eventually convicted of first-degree conspiracy to commit murder.

She sung along her ex-husband, Mangal, during the 1980s and early 1990s. Naghma sings mostly in Pashto but has also recorded in the Dari Persian language. She is considered to be folklore female artist in Afghanistan and continues to be the voice and face of Pashtun traditional music. Early years Naghma was born as Shaperai (Pashto: ښاپېرۍ meaning Head Fairy) on 1 January 1964 in Afghanistan. The city of her birth cannot be verified. She was the eldest daughter in a family of five boys and three girls. Her father's name was Syed Suleiman Shah and her mother is Bibi Mashala. Her father died when Naghma was five years old. As a young girl, she developed an interest in music. At sixteen she moved to Kabul with her paternal uncle. She continued her secondary education at Rabia Balkhi Lece where she was performing in the girl's band as a vocalist. A year before finishing her high school she married Mangal, an already popular Pashto singer from Laghman Province, and consequently left school to advance her musical career. They were instant celebrities, recording hits that are famous to this day. Her early songs were based on southern Afghan music, most of which were folkloric in nature. Coming from a traditional family, she met with much resistance from relatives who saw singing as taboo for Afghan woman. Naghma has often stated in interviews that till today her mother is still not happy with her career choice. However, Naghma was not discouraged by this. In Mangal she found a supporting husband and as duo the pressure from society was much more bearable as opposed to being solo. With impending civil war, the couple left Afghanistan for India in 1992. Eventually they settled in Islamabad, Pakistan. There, they became very successful with an enthusiastic crowd of Afghan exiles who were nostalgic for their native music. Their financial situation by this time had improved significantly. In 2000, they left Pakistan and immigrated to the United States. Personal life After establishing contact with the Afghan community of Northern California, the duo held a series of performances. In 2006, after years of ups and downs in their marriage, the couple divorced. Though no specific reasons have been shared by the couple, some believe Mangal's alleged alcohol abuse was the reason for why the marriage dissolved. The couples have held a dignified silence about their divorce and never mention anything relating to it in public. Their divorce has also cast a doubt as to whether this former pair can reconcile at least on a professional level. While Mangal performs solo in private events and television programs, Naghma is continuing her career as a professional artist. Naghma remarried after her divorce and mentioned that he is from Logar Province. Naghma's daughter married Afghan singer Safiq Mureed, in a private ceremony in 2014. Naghma's main home and her children are in California but she has also made a place for herself in Kabul and Islamabad. In March 2014, she became the first Afghan to receive the Tamgha-e-Imtiaz and the Pride of Performance, the highest Pakistani Presidential Awards handed to artists, sportsmen, scientists, and writers. It was a proud moment for Naghma who has always been a strong voice for the Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Naghma encourages Afghan refugees to try and go back to Afghanistan through her aid work and music to rebuild the country. Discography She has recorded over 500 songs in a period of 32 years in Afghanistan, Pakistan and also in the United States.

A total of 64 football clubs entered the first round draw. Team distribution was inherited from the Fairs Cup with only little changes: seat cessions between Denmark and Sweden and between Scotland and East Germany were yet decided. Three nations never joined the Fairs Cup, so Yugoslavia ceded a team to near Albania, Greece to near Cyprus, while a place for Soviet Union was obtained from the holders.UEFA Cup consequently had not a place for its holders, differently from the European and the Cupwinners Cup. This fact was not seen as a problem, under the idea that a club winning the UEFA Cup should be so strong to qualify through its championship: it was true until Inter Milan's victory in 1994. The tournament's top scorer was Ludwig Bründl of Eintracht Braunschweig with ten goals.

He helped establish the Children's Bible Hour in 1942, and was the chairman of this large ministry [it is on nearly 600 radio stations] for 33 years. He also cared deeply for world missions and was for 52 years on the board of the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism. A great love for the Bible was one of the distinguishing features of Fuller’s life and ministry. By the time he retired from 40 years as pastor of the Wealthy Street Baptist Church in 1974, he had read the Bible through 75 times. Fuller dedicated much of his life to the defense of the Byzantine text-type as embodied in the Textus Receptus and, largely, the King James Version. In February 1988, Fuller died at Blodgett Memorial Medical Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Published works Fuller’s three volumes on the subject of texts and versions contain the full or summarized works of many older authorities on the textual issue. The most notable influence being Benjamin G. Wilkinson. Others include John Burgon, Herman C.

In legal drama, generally, they create opportunities to depict lawyers engaged in dramatic interactions that are reflective of the real-world drama of the profession.Michael Asimow, Embodiment of Evil: Law Firms in the Movies, 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1339 (2001). The portrayal of law firms varies by the media in which they are presented, with law firms in novels and in films (many of which are simply adaptations of the novels) being presented in a negative light, while law firms in television series tending to be presented more positively. In books and film The opposing large law firm is a standard villain in legal thrillers and trial films alike. In 2001, UCLA law professor Michael Asimow wrote: Because of this perception, law firms are readily represented as places of intrigue and deception, with modern portrayals that \\"extend from the surreal to the diabolical\\".Margaret Raymond, On Legalistic Behavior, the Advocacy Privilege, and Why People Hate Lawyers, 55 Buffalo L. Rev. 929 (2007). Asimow notes that these portrayals have real legal significance because \\"stories about law, lawyers, or the legal system in film, television, or print\\" are the vehicle by which \\"the public learns most of what it thinks it knows about law, lawyers and the legal system\\". Although the first film specifically about a law firm, the 1933 film Counsellor at Law, portrays the fictional New York City law firm of Simon & Tedesco as an upstanding practice populated by attorneys who are good-hearted (if occasionally lapsing in their ethical conduct), this type of entity was thereafter typically portrayed on film as a villainous enterprise. John Grisham, in particular, has displayed a penchant for portraying large firms as evil entities, contrasted against heroic solo practitioners, small firm attorneys, law students, and against their own more ethical young associates. In television Fictional law firms that serve as the backdrop for television shows tend to be portrayed in a more sympathetic light. Asimow wrote that it is \\"striking how much more favorably law firms are portrayed on dramatic television series than in film\\". This is reflected in the earliest television series depicting a law firm, The Defenders which revolved around the father and son firm of Preston & Preston. Other sympathetic portrayals are found in L.A. Law, Ally McBeal, and The Practice, and Will & Grace (which is not centered on a law firm, but prominently depicts one in several episodes as a title character's place of employment). Each of these shows depict a mid- size firm, rather than an office of a very large firm, and each depicts attorneys employed by the firm as having very different legal specialties and temperaments. These positive portrayals, however, do not extend to larger firms. Many television programs having law firms at their core have been written or created by David E. Kelley, himself a Boston University School of Law graduate who had worked for a Boston law firm. Kelley was a writer for L.A. Law, and created Ally McBeal, The Practice, and Boston Legal, and also scripted the film, From the Hip, a legal thriller that centered some acerbic attention on the machinations of the lead character's law firm.

In addition to composing, Rangström was also a musical critic and conductor. Biography Rangström in front of Rangströmska Farm on Södermalm, 1918. Rangström was born in Stockholm, where in his late teens he started to write songs. His music teacher suggested that he should \\"vary the harmonies a bit more, make it a bit wilder!\\" He followed this advice and soon gained the nickname among his colleagues of \\"Sturm-und-Drangström\\".Jacobsson, Stig (1996). \\"Ture Rangström – Symphony No. 2, Intermezzo drammatico\\". cpo 999 368-2 (CD Booklet): 10–14. He travelled to Berlin where he studied under Hans Pfitzner for a while in 1905–6, and also studied singing with the Wagnerian Julius Hey, with whom he later went to Munich for further studies. His compositions at this time were chiefly for voice and piano. Between 1907 and 1922 he taught singing and from 1922 to 1925 he was principal conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra. He founded the Swedish Society of Composers in 1924, and he was employed to promote the works of the Royal Swedish Opera from 1931 to 1936. After this he worked freelance and spent the summers on the island of Törnsholmen which he had been given by the people of Sweden who raised the money to celebrate his fiftieth birthday. Rangström died at his home in Stockholm after a long illness caused by a throat disease; his funeral was held at Stockholm's Maria Magdalena Church and he is buried in the churchyard at Gryt, Valdemarsvik Municipality, Östergötland County, southeast Sweden. He was grandfather of a playwright, also named Ture Rangström (born in 1944) the artistic director of Strindbergs Intima Teater (since its re-opening in 2003), and uncle of author Lars Gyllensten. Works Many of his early works took the form of symphonic poems, including Dityramb (Dithyramb) (1909), Ett midsommarstycke (A midsummer piece) and En höstsång (An autumn song). Following the success of these poems, Rangström began work on his symphonies, of which there are four. The first, produced in 1914, is dedicated to the memory of Strindberg – August Strindberg in memoriam; the second, from 1919, is entitled Mitt land (My country); the third from 1929, Sång under stjärnorna (Song under the stars), and the fourth from 1936, Invocatio, for orchestra and organ. He composed three operas, entitled Kronbruden (The Crown Bride), based on a play by Strindberg, which was first performed in 1915, Medeltida (Medieval), published in 1921, and Gilgamesj, based on the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, written during the last years of his life.

Kimelman (January 21, 1921 – November 9, 2009) was an American businessman, political adviser and diplomat. The Kimelman family were Eastern European immigrants who settled in Brooklyn. His father, Sigmund, was a textile manufacturer. His mother's name was Caroline. They had three children: Benedict, Henry and Claire. The family were middle class until declaring bankruptcy during the Great Depression. Kimelman joined the Naval Reserves under the V7 Program as an officer. He was later attached with the Seabees in the Aleutian Islands. He attained the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade). He both married and graduated in 1943. In 1948, Kimelman began ties with the U.S. Virgin Islands where through his father-in-law Sidney Kessler. Kessler was a businessman who owned a rum distillery and later expanded the hotel industry on St. Thomas. This was the beginning of Kimelman's lucrative career. He was president of the Virgin Isle Hotel, the largest resort in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, from 1950 to 1960. He was also chairman of the board and CEO of Island Block Corp. from 1955 to 1980, and chairman and CEO of the West Indies Corp. from 1969 to 1980. His involvement in politics began with his appointment as a delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands to the Caribbean Organization. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the United States Delegation to the Independence Ceremonies of both Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica. He served as the first Commissioner of Commerce, Industry and Tourism for the United States Virgin Islands from 1961 to 1964. He was a director and chairman of the executive committee of Diners Club and served on the board of the American Hotel Association. In 1967, during the Johnson Administration, he was appointed Chief of Staff to United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall. In 1968, the President appointed him to the board of the newly created National Parks Foundation. His political work for the Democratic Party landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. He was chairman of the board, and finance chairman of the George McGovern presidential committee in 1972. He was deputy chairman and finance chairman of Senator Frank Church's presidential campaign in 1976, and a senior political adviser to Gary Hart's presidential campaign in 1988. In 1981, he was made partner at investment bank LF Rothschild. He semi-retired in 1990. He was the first US Ambassador to be awarded Haiti's highest civilian decoration, the Grand Cross of Honor and Merit. The Governor of the Virgin Islands proclaimed February 4, 1998, \\"Henry L.

He was an ambassador to the most important courts of Europe. Family John Butler, 6th Earl of Ormond was the second son of James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, by his first wife, Joan de Beauchamp (d. 3 or 5 August 1430). He had an elder brother, James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond, and a younger brother, Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond, as well as two sisters, Elizabeth Butler, who married John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, and Anne Butler (d. 4 January 1435), who was contracted to marry Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond, although the marriage appears not to have taken place. Career =War of the Roses= A supporter of the Lancastrian cause, he was present at the Battle of Towton in 1461 where his elder brother was killed. He succeeded his brother to the title, but was forced to go on the run after this heavy defeat. Taking shelter in either Cumbria or Scotland he then crossed over to Ireland where there was still considerable support for his cause in Tipperary and Kilkenny. After raising a force amongst them he was confronted by the pro-Yorkist head of the Dublin government, Thomas Fitzgerald, Earl of Desmond. The two clashed at the Battle of Piltown in 1462, which ended in a decisive Yorkist victory. Ormond's army suffered over a thousand casualties. He was subsequently restored to the earldom by Edward IV after having been attainted for his part in the Towton. Edward IV is reported to have said that \\"if good breeding and liberal qualities were lost in the world, they might be all found in the Earl of Ormond\\". He was a complete master of the languages of Europe, and was sent as ambassador to its principal courts. Marriage and children Ellis says that 'according to family tradition, Ormond died unmarried in the Holy Land, on pilgrimage, before 15 June 1477, possibly on 14 December 1476'.

Prikryl was born in Vienna, grew up in Alsergrund, and became a plumber's assistant. He served in the First World War, and married for the first time, getting divorced soon after. In the 1930s, he left his second wife and their two children and travelled to France, continuing on to Spain in 1938. He fought in the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War against the Nationalists, and was injured. There is no reliable information about his movements in the time thereafter. At the end of the Second World War, he was back in Vienna, and was apparently recognised by a Soviet officer alongside whom he had fought in Spain. This chance meeting resulted in him being made mayor, although the exact reasoning remains unclear. Although being Vienna's only communist mayor, the Communist Party of Austria never acknowledged Prikryl as a member. His time as mayor saw no practical policy decisions, instead concentrating on bureaucratic tasks, chiefly giving out permissions of various kinds. On 17 April he was replaced by Theodor Körner. Prikryl later married again, and started a plumbing firm, which later went bankrupt. He died in Vienna in poverty, and was buried in a grave of honour in Vienna's Feuerhalle Simmering.

Santiago Ramón y Cajal proposed that neurons are not continuous throughout the body, yet still communicate with each other, an idea known as the neuron doctrine. The word \\"synapse\\" – from the Greek synapsis (), meaning \\"conjunction\\", in turn from ( (\\"together\\") and (\\"to fasten\\")) – was introduced in 1897 by the English neurophysiologist Charles Sherrington in Michael Foster's Textbook of Physiology. Sherrington struggled to find a good term that emphasized a union between two separate elements, and the actual term \\"synapse\\" was suggested by the English classical scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall, a friend of Foster. Some authors generalize the concept of the synapse to include the communication from a neuron to any other cell type, such as to a motor cell, although such non-neuronal contacts may be referred to as junctions (a historically older term). A landmark study by Sanford Palay demonstrated the existence of synapses. Synapses are essential to neuronal function: neurons are cells that are specialized to pass signals to individual target cells, and synapses are the means by which they do so. At a synapse, the plasma membrane of the signal-passing neuron (the presynaptic neuron) comes into close apposition with the membrane of the target (postsynaptic) cell. Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic sites contain extensive arrays of molecular machinery that link the two membranes together and carry out the signaling process. In many synapses, the presynaptic part is located on an axon and the postsynaptic part is located on a dendrite or soma. Astrocytes also exchange information with the synaptic neurons, responding to synaptic activity and, in turn, regulating neurotransmission. Synapses (at least chemical synapses) are stabilized in position by synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) projecting from both the pre- and post-synaptic neuron and sticking together where they overlap; SAMs may also assist in the generation and functioning of synapses. Chemical and electrical synapses An example of chemical synapse by the release of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine or glutamic acid. There are two fundamentally different types of synapses: * In a chemical synapse, electrical activity in the presynaptic neuron is converted (via the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels) into the release of a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds to receptors located in the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell. The neurotransmitter may initiate an electrical response or a secondary messenger pathway that may either excite or inhibit the postsynaptic neuron. Chemical synapses can be classified according to the neurotransmitter released: glutamatergic (often excitatory), GABAergic (often inhibitory), cholinergic (e.g. vertebrate neuromuscular junction), and adrenergic (releasing norepinephrine). Because of the complexity of receptor signal transduction, chemical synapses can have complex effects on the postsynaptic cell. * In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell membranes are connected by special channels called gap junctions that are capable of passing an electric current, causing voltage changes in the presynaptic cell to induce voltage changes in the postsynaptic cell. The main advantage of an electrical synapse is the rapid transfer of signals from one cell to the next. Synaptic communication is distinct from an ephaptic coupling, in which communication between neurons occurs via indirect electric fields. An autapse is a chemical or electrical synapse that forms when the axon of one neuron synapses onto dendrites of the same neuron. Types of interfaces Synapses can be classified by the type of cellular structures serving as the pre- and post-synaptic components. The vast majority of synapses in the mammalian nervous system are classical axo-dendritic synapses (axon synapsing upon a dendrite), however, a variety of other arrangements exist. These include but are not limited to axo-axonic, dendro- dendritic, axo-secretory, somato-dendritic, dendro-somatic, and somato-somatic synapses. The axon can synapse onto a dendrite, onto a cell body, or onto another axon or axon terminal, as well as into the bloodstream or diffusely into the adjacent nervous tissue. Different types of synapses Role in memory It is widely accepted that the synapse plays a role in the formation of memory. As neurotransmitters activate receptors across the synaptic cleft, the connection between the two neurons is strengthened when both neurons are active at the same time, as a result of the receptor's signaling mechanisms. The strength of two connected neural pathways is thought to result in the storage of information, resulting in memory. This process of synaptic strengthening is known as long-term potentiation. By altering the release of neurotransmitters, the plasticity of synapses can be controlled in the presynaptic cell. The postsynaptic cell can be regulated by altering the function and number of its receptors. Changes in postsynaptic signaling are most commonly associated with a N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) due to the influx of calcium into the post-synaptic cell, which are the most analyzed forms of plasticity at excitatory synapses. Study models For technical reasons, synaptic structure and function have been historically studied at unusually large model synapses, for example: * Squid giant synapse * Neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a cholinergic synapse in vertebrates, glutamatergic in insects * Ciliary calyx in the ciliary ganglion of chicks * Calyx of Held in the brainstem * Ribbon synapse in the retina * Schaffer collateral synapse in the hippocampus Synaptic polarization The function of neurons depends upon cell polarity. The distinctive structure of nerve cells allows action potentials to travel directionally (from dendrites to cell body down the axon), and for these signals to then be received and carried on by post-synaptic neurons or received by effector cells. Nerve cells have long been used as models for cellular polarization, and of particular interest are the mechanisms underlying the polarized localization of synaptic molecules. PIP2 signaling regulated by IMPase plays an integral role in synaptic polarity. Phosphoinositides (PIP, PIP2, and PIP3) are molecules that have been shown to affect neuronal polarity. A gene (ttx-7) was identified in Caenorhabditis elegans that encodes myo-inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), an enzyme that produces inositol by dephosphorylating inositol phosphate. Organisms with mutant ttx-7 genes demonstrated behavioral and localization defects, which were rescued by expression of IMPase. This led to the conclusion that IMPase is required for the correct localization of synaptic protein components. The egl-8 gene encodes a homolog of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), an enzyme that cleaves PIP2. When ttx-7 mutants also had a mutant egl-8 gene, the defects caused by the faulty ttx-7 gene were largely reversed. These results suggest that PIP2 signaling establishes polarized localization of synaptic components in living neurons.  Presynaptic modulation  Modulation of neurotransmitter release by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a prominent presynaptic mechanism for regulation of synaptic transmission. The activation of GPCRs located at the presynaptic terminal, can decrease the probability of neurotransmitter release. This presynaptic depression involves activation of Gi/o-type G-proteins that mediate different inhibitory mechanisms, including inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, activation of potassium channels, and direct inhibition of the vesicle fusion process. Endocannabinoids, synthesized in and released from postsynaptic neuronal elements, and their cognate receptors, including the (GPCR) CB1 receptor, located at the presynaptic terminal, are involved in this modulation by an retrograde signaling process, in which these compounds are synthesized in and released from postsynaptic neuronal elements, and travel back to the presynaptic terminal to act on the CB1 receptor for short-term (STD) or long- term synaptic depression (LTD), that cause a short or long lasting decrease in neurotransmitter release.

It is owned by Empresas 1BC, a Venezuelan private media corporation. History =Background= In 1930, Edgar J. Anzola, who was employed in an electronics business named Almacén Americano, brought to his employer, William Henry Phelps, his idea to mount a radio station in Caracas. Phelps already possessed the RCA Victor receptors, discs and equipment players, Underwood typewriters, Frigidaire refrigerators, Delco power plants, and Ford cars and trucks. Enthusiastic about Anzola's idea, Phelps installed a transmitter exclusively for commercial purposes. Ricardo Espina and technical manager Alberto López joined Phelps and Anzola in establishing a radio station. =Inauguration and early history= After hard work, everything was ready for Broadcasting Caracas, as the station was originally called, to go on the air. Careful tests were performed to make sure that all the equipment operated fully. Two of these tests had unique importance. One of them, which was held on 9 December 1930 and took place in the Plaza del Teatro Nacional during the dedication of the statue of Henry Clay, was the first remote transmission in Venezuela. That date marked the first broadcast of the new radio station which operated with a transmitter that had the capacity of 100 kilowatts. The next day, from the ballroom of the La Guaira Country Club, the performances of a band from the US Navy cruiser was aired in light of their visit to the port city. These broadcasts excited the residents of Caracas and increased the sales of radio appliances. The station began airing more commercial propaganda, which was the intention of its founders. The official inauguration of Broadcasting Caracas took place on 11 December 1930, and everything was ready for its debut: the orchestras, broadcasters, singers, technicians, and even commercials, which were discreet and addressed in a well-kept language that corresponded to the station that would set the tone for future stations to be installed in the country. The first opening act was a concert by the station's orchestra conducted by Carlos Bonnet. The inauguration of Broadcasting Caracas made it the first permanent and first commercial radio station to begin operations in Venezuela (the first radio station to operate in Venezuela was AYRE, a government-owned station which began operations on 4 April 1926. AYRE ceased operations in 1928 due to political problems). On 17 December 1930, from the state of Carabobo, Broadcasting Caracas made its second remote transmission during the inauguration of the monument commemorating the Battle of Carabobo. On 22 March 1931, Broadcasting Caracas made its first sports broadcast, which was narrated by Esteban Ballesté Jr. from the Nuevo Circo de Caracas where the fight for the Welter title was taking place between Peter Martín and the North American Tommy White. In the beginning, music was aired from 7:00 pm until closing at 10:00 pm, but transmission started at 6:00 pm with El Diario Hablado which was considered the first Venezuelan radio news broadcast. Also at that hour, the news of the Panorama Universal could be heard, whose slogan \\"say it on Panorama Universal and all of Venezuela will know\\" was a success. Months later, the station began broadcasting from the morning until eleven o'clock at night. In those day, it was customary to publish the programming schedule in the newspapers. On 7 July 1932, the first radio news program was born: El Diario Hablado was broadcast twice daily. The first person in charge of that news program was Mario García Arocha, who was its columnist, narrator, and producer. Later, Alejandro Fuenmayor joined the program. In 1933, Francisco Fossa Andersen was put in charge of El Diario Hablado, where he remained for 15 years and created his own personal style in the narration of news. YV1BC was the call sign of the station. YV, according to the international radio code, corresponds to Venezuela. The number 1 is the first licensed in the country and the following letters are the initials of the station. Many programs marked the beginning of Broadcasting Caracas. They included La Hora de los Aficionados, which aired Tuesdays to Saturdays from 12:00 pm to 12:30 pm; La Radio Consulta with Francisco Fossa Andersen; Selecciones Deportivas; El Teatro de la Alegría, whose orchestra was conducted by Fortunato Barcarola; Horas del Municipal; La Familia Buchipluma; La Familia Santa Teresa; La Tremenda Jefatura, with Rafa Gonzalez Fina rojas among others great comedians and actors wcho began in Radio Caracas and later moved to the Radiodifusora Venezuela station; La Noche Joven; Conferencias Católicas; Sección Femenina; Pepe Alemán; Los Raslalantes Sanjuaneros; El Tío Nicolás; La Marcha del Tiempo and La Hora del Ministerio de Instrucción Pública, a program hosted by Guillermo Fernández de Arcila and Aracelis Cuervo Codazzi, professors at the Academy of Music and Declamation. In the area of radionovelas, Broadcasting Caracas, a pioneer in the genre, broadcast works that made history and are still remembered by those who heard them. Among them included El Matrimonio Radiotrén, El Misterio de los Ojos Escarlatas, La Herencia del Conde Bermejas, El Tesoro de Sir Walter Raleigh, Los Experimentos del Dr. Hook, El Enigma de los Incas, El Alma del Tirano Aguirre, La Familia Santa Teresa, El Buque Fantasma, La Sayona, El Secreto de Ayarú, El Emir, and Cupertino y sus Maquinistas. It was in 1932 that Alfredo Cortina and Mario García Arocha wrote the very first radionovela: the comedy Santa Teresa, whose quality and humor kept it on the air for four years. The following year, El Misterio de los Ojos Escarlatas marked the beginning of the suspenseful radionovelas. A lot human imagination was put into the story that made history on Broadcasting Caracas in the 1930s. The plot caused so much excitement in the listeners that it was kept on the air for many months, and not only managed to entertain the audience, but described, in the development of each episode, several areas of the country during an era in which only a few people travelled. A star-studded cast protagonized the story written by Alfredo Cortina, most notably Edgar Anzola as Herr Mullernb and Indio Miguel; Margot Antillano as Eulalia; Cecilia Martínez as Alida Palmero; Luis Alfonso Larrain as Jaime, and Francisco Fossa Andersen as Dr. Aular. Also, Mario García Arocha was in charge of the narration. After this experience came El Misterio de las Tres Torres, a radionovela with a political touch written after the fall of the Gómez dictatorship. It contained reflexions on life in the Tres Torres prison of Barquisimeto. It starred Antonio José Marcano and Alejandro Arratia Oses and was written by Tulio Flores and Pablo Sosa Guzmán, among others. In 1945, Radio Caracas, with Tomás Henríquez in charge of the department of radionovelas, included this genre in its programming. Titles such as Las Sombras del Otro and Tú también eres mi Hija, caused a big impact on its listeners. Finally, another well-remembered radionovela transmitted by Radio Caracas was Cuatro Horas antes de Morir with Tomás Henríquez. The voices of this production were Carmencita Serrano and the famous actor-narrator Pancho Pepe Cróquer. Besides, the legendary bolero singer Graciela Naranjo made her professional debut on Broadcasting Caracas at the age of 15. In 1935, following the death of General Juan Vicente Gómez on 17 December, Broadcasting Caracas changed its name to Radio Caracas. In 1942, Radio Caracas launched El Reporter Esso presented by the Creole Petroleum Corporation (a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey). In its first years was written by the United Press news agency via teletype. This famous news segment gave the rise to big voices such as Amable Espina, Francisco Amado Pernía, Marco Antonio Lacavalerie, and Carlos Quintana Negrón, among others. In 1945, Renny Ottolina began his career on Radio Caracas as a news narrator. The following year, Alfredo Sadel debuted on Radio Caracas, in which he recorded his first song, Desesperanza in 1946. Unfortunately, Desesperanza never went on the air, but Sadel would go on to host popular radio shows such as Caravana Camel, an evening radio program where he made his claim to fame. Other artists, musicians, and personalities that made their debut on Radio Caracas included Eduardo Serrano (as an orchestra director), Fedora Alemán, Ángel Sauce, Pedro Antonio Ríos Reyna, Antonio Estévez, and Amador Bendayán, to name a few. The best narrators in the nation have come from Radio Caracas, a reason why some people called it the university of radio in Venezuela. Rising stars such as Edgar J. Anzola, Ricardo Espina, Francisco Fossa Andersen, Mario García Arocha, Esteban Ballesté, Oscar Eduardo Rickel, Justo Piñero Rojas, Luis Brito Arocha, Billo Frómeta, Rafael Guillermo Zamora, Renny Ottolina, Angel Edmundo Brice, Alberto Oyarzábal, Alcides Toro, Enrique Vera Fortique, Antonio Castes, Víctor Saume, Amable Espina, León Bravo, José Matías Rojas, Enrique Ascanio Buróz, Domingo Hurtado, Juan Francisco Rodríguez, Félix Cardona Moreno, Ulises Acosta, Leandro Azuaje, Francisco Amado Pernía, Héctor Mayerston, Jesús Maella, Ernesto D' Escrivan, Alberto Blanco Uribe, and Eduardo Martínez Plaza, among others came from here. In the 1940s, the program Anuncios Féminas, hosted by María Teresa Castillo and Anita Massanett, was created, and was considered the first feminist program on Venezuelan radio. It was a program dedicated to the orientation and general education of ladies which later moved to Radio Continente. A famous journalist claims that the overthrow of General Isaías Medina Angarita was consolidated when one of the leaders of the civil- military coup of 18 October 1945 spoke on Radio Caracas and made a call to the public to incorporate into the \\"revolution\\". =Format changes & recent history= After the inauguration of Radio Caracas Televisiόn on 15 November 1953, Radio Caracas became known as Radio Caracas Radio in order to avoid confusion with its television counterpart. With the arrival of Peter Bottome as director in 1959, things began to change. The style of the narrators were modified. North American music became a fashion and the transmission of radionovelas, horse races, and other sports were eliminated. Due to the high listenership from people in their automobiles, Radio Caracas Radio, on 16 November 1969, began airing traffic reports made from the \\"Tango Tango Fox\\" airplane. In the beginning, the traffic reports were conducted by Alfredo José Mena and Efraín de la Cerda. Both these men hold the merit of being the first traffic reporters in Venezuela and having created a very peculiar narration style. The 1970s gave rise to new programs on Radio Caracas Radio: Venezuela Canta Así, hosted by Jorge Galvis; Por el Mundo de la Música, a program dedicated to the broadcast of classical music which was hosted by professor José Antonio Calcaño and aired between 1975 and 1978, a date in which the famous Venezuelan musicologist died; Venezuela en los 750, produced and narrated by William Guzmán; La Gran Consulta Popular, a program produced and hosted by Miguel Toro in which the general public could interrogate the invited guests through telephone calls. In 1992, Radio Caracas Radio abandoned music and converted into the first radio station dedicated night and day to news. On 13 May 2003, Roberto Giusti, host of the program Golpe a Golpe, filed a complaint with the Public Prosecutor's Office denouncing the death threats he had been receiving. On 2 May, a group of about ten people entered the studios of Radio Caracas Radio and began shouting offensive slogans at the journalist and calling him a \\"murderer\\". The attackers sprayed graffiti on the building's walls and Giusti's car. Giusti called for an investigation into the incident and possible links to his reports on the presence of Colombian guerrillas in Venezuela. On 28 June 2005, Expediente, conducted by Francisco Olivares, won the 2005 Monseñor Pellín Award for best national radio program. After Radio Caracas Televisiόn was taken off the air at 11:59 p.m. on 27 May 2007, due to the government of Hugo Chávez's decision not to renew its broadcast license, Radio Caracas Radio began transmitting El Observador, the newscast of Radio Caracas Televisiόn. It is the flagship radio newscast of RCR today. As of July 2019, the RCR 750 transmitter is currently off air.

History The territory of Oliena has been inhabited since the Palaeolithic Era until today. The first proofs about the above- mentioned presences have been found inside the Grotta Corbeddu. The Nuragic civilization featured at least 54 villages, 30 nuraghes, sepulchres, buildings with a likely sacred destination were calculated. As part of the medieval Giudicato of Torres, Oliena was one of the curatorie of Posada. Later it was held by the Republic of Pisa. During the war between the Aragonese and the Giudicato of Arborea, the commune was occupied by Eleanor of Arborea's troops. The village, developed in medieval times, at the foot of a castle remembered in toponomy, remained to Arborea until its fall. Oliena was passed to the Carrozs family, and later annexed to the marquisate of Quirra, as a feudal state of the Carrozs, and then of the Osorios family, who held it until 1839. Geography =Territory= The territory of Oliena extends towards the north-eastern slope of the Supramonte,http://www.bestsmalltownsitaly.com/town/oliena-sardinia-south- islands/ as far as the eastern foot of mount Ortobene, embracing the valley crossed by Cedrino river, which opens towards the plains of Galtellì and Orosei. The inhabited centre lies about above sea level at the foot of a mountain that rises vertically to the Mount Corrasi. Flora and fauna Species living in the most inaccessibles zones of the Mount Corrasi include: * Aquilegia nugorensis * Armeria morisii * Campanula forsythii * Cerastium Supramontanum * Erinus alpinus * Limonium * Nepeta foliosa * Paeonia mascula * Ribes sardorum martelli * Taxus baccata Wildlife species living in the Oliena territory include: * peregrine falcon * royal eagle * moufflon * wild boar * buzzard * Sardinian hare * Sardinian fox * Sardinian deer * Speleomantes Supramontis, a geo-newt, * Griffon vulture Main sights =Churches= The church of Santa Maria is at the centre of Oliena. *Church of Santa Maria was built during the Pisan period. *Former church of Sant'Ignazio *Santa Croce (Santa Rughe) *San Lussorio =Nuraghes= The Nuraghe Biriài is located, between two rocky spurs, in a position that makes it able to dominate the whole Cedrino valley. The passage, leading to a suspension door to the north, forms a trapezoidal span surmounted by a powerful architrave with a window lintel. The Nuraghe Luduruju is located on the border of the Gollei Ospène Plateau. It follows the single-tower typology, with one room, built with slab- shaped blocks of local basalt. The Nuraghe Otha'he stands on a rocky outcrop. It was surrounded along its perimeter by a wall curtain. In spite of the limestone (a rock hard to work upon), it was used. In the interior of the Nuraghe Susùne, a tholos room opens to the internal passage. According to the transept scheme, it provided another trapezoidal light oriented to the west. Other nuraghes include Nuraghe Suvegliu. =Sepulchres= The Megalithic sepulchre of Catteddu Crìspu is formed by two hangings; one external with megalithic blocks, and the other internal with the small hewns. The interior is encumbered by a large slab with three hollows carved on its ends. The Domos de Gurpìa are examples of Domus de Janas excavated in a granite erratic block. Other 'Domus de Janas include: *Domos de Suvangiu * Domos de Jumpàdu * Domos de Frathale =Nuragic village of Tiscali= Tiscali is situated in the largegrotto that shelters the village. Discovered at the end of the 17th century, it is commonly considered to be a Nuragic site. The inhabited centre of huts, built with small stones joined together by mud, was for inhabited also in the Roman and Medieval ages. =Nuragic village of Sedda 'e sos Carros= This village is located in the Lanaitho Valley. Oliena, on the right, with the Mount Corrasi in the background.

Synapse formation was induced by Staphylococcal enterotoxin E superantigen. In immunology, an immunological synapse (or immune synapse) is the interface between an antigen-presenting cell or target cell and a lymphocyte such as a T/B cell or Natural Killer cell. The interface was originally named after the neuronal synapse, with which it shares the main structural pattern. An immunological synapse consists of molecules involved in T cell activation, which compose typical patterns—activation clusters. Immunological synapses are the subject of much ongoing research. Structure and Function The immune synapse is also known as the supramolecular activation cluster or SMAC. This structure is composed of concentric rings each containing segregated clusters of proteins—often referred to as the bull’s-eye model of the immunological synapse: * c-SMAC (central-SMAC) composed of the θ isoform of protein kinase C, CD2, CD4, CD8, CD28, Lck, and Fyn. * p-SMAC (peripheral-SMAC) within which the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and the cytoskeletal protein talin are clustered. * d-SMAC (distal-SMAC) enriched in CD43 and CD45 molecules. New investigations, however, have shown that a \\"bull’s eye\\" is not present in all immunological synapses. For example, different patterns appear in the synapse between a T-cell and a dendritic cell. This complex as a whole is postulated to have several functions including but not limited to: *Regulation of lymphocyte activation *Transfer of peptide-MHC complexes from APCs to lymphocytes *Directing secretion of cytokines or lytic granules Recent research has proposed a striking parallel between the immunological synapse and the primary cilium based mainly on similar actin rearrangement, orientation of the centrosome towards the structure and involvement of similar transport molecules (such as IFT20, Rab8, Rab11). This structural and functional homology is the topic of ongoing research.  Formation  The initial interaction occurs between LFA-1 present in the p-SMAC of a T-cell, and non-specific adhesion molecules (such as ICAM-1 or ICAM-2) on a target cell. When bound to a target cell, the T-cell can extend pseudopodia and scan the surface of target cell to find a specific peptide:MHC complex. The process of formation begins when the T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to the peptide:MHC complex on the antigen-presenting cell and initiates signaling activation through formation of microclusters/lipid rafts. Specific signaling pathways lead to polarization of the T-cell by orienting its centrosome toward the site of the immunological synapse. The symmetric centripetal actin flow is the basis of formation of the p-SNAP ring. The accumulation and polarization of actin is triggered by TCR/CD3 interactions with integrins and small GTPases (such as Rac1 or Cdc42). These interactions activate large multi-molecular complexes (containing WAVE (Scar), HSP300, ABL2, SRA1, and NAP1 and others) to associate with Arp2/3, which directly promotes actin polymerization. As actin is accumulated and reorganized, it promotes clustering of TCRs and integrins. The process thereby upregulates itself via positive feedback. Some parts of this process may differ in CD4+ and CD8+ cells. For example, synapse formation is quick in CD8+ T cells, because for CD8+ T cells it is fundamental to eliminate the pathogen quickly. In CD4+ T cells, however, the whole process of the immunological synapse formation can take up to 6 hours. In CD8+ T cells, the synapse formation leads to killing of the target cell via secretion of cytolytic enzymes. CD8+ T lymphocytes contain lytic granules – specialized secretory lysosomes filled with perforin, granzymes, lysosomal hydrolases (for example cathepsins B and D, β-hexosaminidase) and other cytolytic effector proteins. Once these proteins are delivered to the target cell, they induce its apoptosis. The effectivity of killing of the target cell depends on the strength of the TCR signal. Even after receiving weak or short-lived signals, the MTOC polarizes towards the immunological synapse, but in that case the lytic granules are not trafficked and therefore the killing effect is missing or poor.  NK-cell synapse  NK cells are known to form synapses with cytolytic effect towards the target cell. In the initiation step, NK cell approaches the target cell, either accidentally or intentionally due to the chemotactic signalling. Firstly, the sialyl Lewis X present on the surface of target cell is recognized by CD2 on NK cell. If the KIR receptors of NK cell find their cognate antigen on the surface of target cell, formation of the lytic synapse is inhibited. If such signal is missing, a tight adhesion via LFA1 and MAC1 is promoted and enhanced by additional signals such as CD226-ligand and CD96-CD155 interactions. Lytic granules are secretory organelles filled with perforin, granzymes and other cytolytic enzymes. After initiation of the cell-cell contact, the lytic granules of NK cells move around the microtubules towards the centrosome, which also relocalizes towards the site of synapse. Then, the contents of lytic granules is released and via vesicles with SNARE proteins transferred to the target cell. Inhibitory immunological synapse of NK cells When an NK cell encounters a self cell, it forms a so-called inhibitory immunological synapse to prevent unwanted cytolysis of target cell. In this process, the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) containing long cytoplasmic tails with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) are clustered in the site of synapse, bind their ligand on the surface of target cell and form the supramolecular inhibitory cluster (SMIC). SMIC then acts to prevent rearrangement of actin, block the recruitment of activatory receptors to the site of synapse and finally, promote detachment from the target cell. This process is essential in protecting NK cells from killing self cells. History Immunological synapses were first discovered by Abraham Kupfer at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver. Their name was coined by Michael Dustin at NYU who studied them in further detail. Daniel M. Davis and Jack Strominger showed structured immune synapses for a different lymphocyte, the Natural Killer cell, and published this around the same time. Abraham Kupfer first presented his findings during one of the Keystone symposia in 1995, when he showed three-dimensional images of immune cells interacting with one another. Key molecules in the synapse are the T cell receptor and its counterpart the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Also important are LFA-1, ICAM-1, CD28, and CD80/CD86.

Natsional'na kinostudiya khudozhnikh filmiv imeni O. Dovzhenka) is a former Soviet film production studio in Ukraine that was named after the Ukrainian film producer, Alexander Dovzhenko, in 1957. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the studio became a property of the government of Ukraine. Since 2000 the film studio was awarded national status. History Main entrance to Dovzhenko Film Studios The studios began in 1920s when the All-Ukrainian Photo-Cinema-Directorate (VUFKU) announced a project proposition for the construction of a cinema factory in 1925. Out of 20 of them was chosen the project of Valerian Rykov, who led his architect group composed of students of the Architectural Department of Kyiv Art Institute in the construction of the O. Dovzhenko Film Studios beginning in 1927. It was at the time the largest in the Ukrainian SSR. Although the filming pavilions were still unfinished a year later, movie production had begun. Many memorial plates are within the studios in memory of the many film producers who had once worked here. One film pavilion is named Shchorsivskyi, because Olexandr Dovzhenko shot his film Shchors there. This area of the studios is used as a museum. The first movie of the film studio was \\"Ivanko and the Butcher\\" by director Aksel Lundin and cameraman A. Meines. Filming began on October 12, 1927 and took place at night, as pavilions were being built during the day. Many talented directors have come to the studio since the first films were shot — Alexander Dovzhenko, Arnold Kordium, Pavlo Dolyna, Leonid Lukov, Ivan Kavaleridze, Igor Savchenko, Favst Lopatynskyi; operators — Danylo Demutskyi, Yurii Yekelchyk, Mykola Topchii, Yozef Rona, I. Shekker, Oleksii Pankratiev; writers — Mykola Bazhan, Oleksandr Korniichuk, Hordii Brasiuk, V. Okhrimenko. It immediately affected the number and quality of the works and the variety of movie genres. In 1929, 10 films were already made. Since 1930, cinema has become under the control of the state and has served to spread the ideology of communism among the population. Still, the 1930s for the Kyiv Film Factory were important years of formation. The apple orchard on the side of the avenue near the studios was planted by the order of Dovzhenko himself.

As of 2011, approximately 26,000 practitioners had been given A4M certificates. The field of anti-aging medicine is not recognized by established medical organizations, such as the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Medical Association (AMA). The Academy's activities include lobbying and public relations. The A4M was founded in 1993 by osteopathic physicians Robert M. Goldman and Ronald Klatz, and as of 2013 claimed 26,000 members from 120 countries. Several of the anti-aging methods recommended by the Academy have wide support among experts in the field, such as exercise and a healthy diet, but others, such as hormone treatments, do not have support from a consensus of the wider medical community. Many scientists studying aging dissociate themselves from the claims of A4M, and critics have accused the group of using misleading marketing to sell expensive and ineffective products. The A4M's founders and merchants who promote products through the organization have been involved in legal and professional disputes. The activities of the A4M are controversial: in 2003 a commentary on the response of the scientific community to the promotion of anti-aging medicine noted that the activities of the A4M were seen as a threat to the credibility of serious scientific research on aging. According to MSNBC, anti-aging advocates have responded to such criticism by describing it as censorship perpetrated by a conspiracy of the US government, notably the Food and Drug Administration, the AMA, and the mainstream media, motivated by competing commercial interests. Tom Perls of the Boston University School of Medicine, a prominent critic of the organization, has stated that claims of censorship and suppression are a common theme in what he calls \\"anti-aging quackery\\". Beliefs According to The New York Times, their co-founder and president Ronald Klatz stated that \\"We're not about growing old gracefully. We're about never growing old.\\" Writing in the 2001 issue of the journal Generations, historian Carole Haber of the University of Delaware, states that Klatz' aspirations and the rhetoric of the A4M \\"reflect well-worn ideas and the often-enunciated hopes of the past\\", drawing parallels with the ideas of the 19th century physiologists Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, Serge Voronoff and Eugen Steinach. Haber states that the current resurgence of these ideas may be due to their appeal to the aging Baby Boom Generation, in a culture that is focused on the ideal of youth. Haber has also discussed the strong continuities within the philosophy of the anti-aging movement, writing that \\"For Steinach and Voronoff, as for the members of the A4M, old age was a \\"grotesque\\" disease that could be scientifically eradicated through the correct combination of hormones, diet, and surgery.\\" A 2006 review of anti-aging medicine notes that of the researchers who are interested in this topic, the \\"vast majority dissociate themselves from the A4M.\\" The Los Angeles Times states that \\"Many physicians, researchers and scientists, delving into the physiological aspects of human aging, view the Academy's activities with disdain, saying that the organization is an inappropriate blend of scientific and commercial interests.\\"Valerie Reitman A rift in business, science of aging Los Angeles Times January 12, 2004, archived url Accessed September 10, 2009 Activities The main activity of the A4M is PR and advocacy for its brand of anti-aging medicine. It does this through publications, on-line activity and sponsoring conferences including the World Anti-Aging Congress and Exposition and the Annual World Congress on Anti-Aging Medicine. Some of these conferences are in conjunction with the World Anti-Aging Academy of Medicine, an umbrella group for several national anti-aging organizations that is also headed by Goldman. The LA Times stated that the 2004 annual conference of the A4M at Las Vegas presented a mix of \\"scientific and technical presentations\\" and exhibitors selling \\"wrinkle creams, hair-growing potions, sexual enhancement pills and hormone treatments\\". According to a review of the anti- aging movement published in 2005, the A4M is one of the most prominent organizations that are making \\"attempts at legitimizing anti-aging as a medical specialty\\". The review notes that these efforts at legitimization are contentious and have been rebuffed by some academic scientists who work on aging, who instead attempt to portray the A4M as \\"charlatans whose main goal is making money\\". In a review of the history of anti-aging medicine published in 2004, Robert Binstock of Case Western Reserve University noted that A4M \\"actively solicits and displays numerous advertisements on its website for products and services (such as cosmetics and alternative medicines and therapies), anti-aging clinics, and anti-aging physicians and practitioners.\\" The Times reported in 2004 that Klatz professes outrage at suggestions that he is motivated by money, quoting him as insisting that \\"The only thing that I sell are books... my website is non-commercial – we’re just trying to advance science.\\"Want to live for ever? The Times September 4, 2004 archive url, page 1 archive url, page 2, Accessed September 15, 2009 The Times went on to note a partnership between Klatz and Goldman and a business named Market America, which sells products that promise to \\"slow the ageing process\\".Market America Refuses to Grow Old Gracefully; Company Launches Anti-Aging Store at Recent Conference. PR Newswire March 18, 2003 cached copy, Accessed September 15, 2009 However, according to a 2005 article in the Chicago Tribune, the company later pulled out of this contract. The A4M's American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine (ABAAM) states that it offers anti-aging medicine as a specialty and gives educational credits to those who attend A4M conferences. The New York Times has reported that the American Board of Medical Specialties does not recognize this body as having professional standing. MSNBC noted that \\"as far as the American Medical Association or the American Board of Medical Specialties is concerned, there is no such thing as an anti-aging specialty.\\" Robert Binstock stated in a 2004 review article in The Gerontologist that \\"Although the organization is not recognized by the American Medical Association, A4M has established three board-certification programs under its auspices—for physicians, chiropractors, dentists, naturopaths, podiatrists, pharmacists, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, nutritionists, dieticians, sports trainers and fitness consultants, and PhDs.\\" Publications The A4M publishes Anti Aging Medical News, a trade periodical which is their official magazine, as well as proceedings of its anti-aging conferences in a periodical called Anti-Aging Therapeutics, this is edited by Klatz and Goldman.Anti-aging therapeutics National Library of Medicine, Accessed September 20, 2009 The International Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine (IJAAM) was another periodical published by the A4M. According to Ulrich's Periodicals Directory, IJAAM was published by Total Health Holdings, LLC from 1998 to 2001, on behalf of the A4M.Record for International Journal of Anti- Aging Medicine, Ulrich's Periodicals Directory The contents of the International Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine have been strongly criticised. In a 2002 letter published in Science, Aubrey de Grey described them as consisting of a set of advertisements for a \\"pseudoscientific anti-aging industry\\". According to Bruce Carnes of the University of Oklahoma: Leonard Hayflick of the University of California, San Francisco, a former editor of Experimental Gerontology, writes: In 2009 the A4M stated that it is no longer associated with the journal and that it had sold its interests in this publication in 1999. They also defended the scientific quality of its contents, writing that almost all of its articles were reviewed by an editorial board before publication.Deposition www.courthousenews.com, archived url August 20, 2009 Robert Binstock of Case Western Reserve University stated in 2004 that this periodical is a \\"nonrefereed publication\\". Divergent views on anti-aging products According to a 2002 article in the Seattle Times, there are two opposing viewpoints of anti-aging products. The article states that the first view is represented by scientists who publish their findings in the scientific literature and who believe that no currently available intervention can slow or prevent aging. The alternative viewpoint is represented by people who the article states have \\"fewer credentials\\" and who promote a range of products that claim to have anti-aging properties.Joel Garreau Holding back the years: Scientists say extended youth may be near Seattle Times 2002, Accessed September 28, 2009 A similar observation was made by Business Week in 2006, when they stated that although anti-aging medicine is increasingly popular, there is \\"precious little scientific data to back up their claims that the potions extend life.\\"Selling The Promise Of Youth cover story Business Week March 20, 2006, Accessed September 28, 2009 As an example of the first viewpoint, a 2004 review in Trends in Biotechnology written by Leigh Turner of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey stated that the products promoted by the A4M have \\"no credible scientific basis\\" and that \\"there are no proven, scientifically established ‘anti-aging’ medications\\". A 2006 review published in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine of the antioxidants and hormones that are promoted as anti-aging products by the A4M and the Life Extension Institute concluded that these products have \\"minimal to no effect on improving longevity or functional abilities.\\" In an editorial accompanying this study, Thomas Perls stated that although many unjustified claims were made about anti-ageing products, no substance had yet been shown to halt or slow the aging process. Similarly, the National Institute on Aging, who are part of the National Institutes of Health, published a general warning in 2009 against businesses that claim anti-aging benefits for their products, describing these as \\"health scams\\" and stating that \\"no treatments have been proven to slow or reverse the aging process\\". The Seattle Times quotes Klatz as describing those who doubt the validity of anti-aging medicine as \\"flat-earthers\\" who make unjustified criticisms that are not backed by scientific evidence, the article also states that Klatz \\"sees the science and medical establishments as out to get him.\\" =Human growth hormone controversy= The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine was formed following a 1990 study on human growth hormone (hGH) that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was performed by Daniel Rudman and colleagues at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Rudman had treated twelve men over 60 years of age with human growth hormone; after six months, these men had an increase in lean body mass and a decrease in adipose tissue mass when compared with a group of nine men who did not receive hormone. Members of the anti-aging movement have interpreted these results to support a role for growth hormone in slowing or reversing aging. A review in The Journal of Urology noted that this promotion of growth hormone as an anti- aging remedy is \\"arguably similar\\" to ideas that date back to the late 19th century, when the physiologist Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard advocated rejuvenating hormone products prepared from animal testicles and stated that \\"the injections have taken 30 years off my life\\". The New York Times reports that the idea that growth hormone can improve \\"health, energy level and sense of well-being.\\" is a core belief of the A4M, with Klatz writing a book in 1998 entitled Grow Young with HGH: The Amazing Medically Proven Plan to Reverse Aging where he states \\"The ‘Fountain of Youth’ lies within the cells of each of us. All you need to do is release it\\". A 2005 review in the Journal of Endocrinological Investigation noted the long history of these ideas, but stated that the \\"concept of a 'hormonal fountain of youth' is predominantly mythological.\\" Nevertheless, Klatz maintains that growth hormone reverses aging as a physical process and has described growth hormone as \\"the first medically proven age-reversal therapy.\\" However, MSNBC reports that Daniel Rudman, the author of the 1990 study that sparked the movement, \\"issued many caveats and cautions about using HGH and never recommended its use to delay aging. In fact, he was horrified his study was being used to support the industry especially since heavy use of growth hormone can have unwanted side effects\\". The New York Times states that medical authorities not affiliated with the A4M question the safety and efficacy of the use of growth hormone in anti-aging medicine, quoting Michael Fossell of Michigan State University who stated that \\"hormone therapies are the new patent medicines – cure-alls embraced by a too-trusting public.\\" A 2003 review that was published in the Annual Review of Medicine noted that the long-term risks or benefits of this treatment are uncertain, that \\"neither the benefits nor the dangers have been defined\\" and advising that a \\"prudent physician should not condone the use of GH for normal aging\\". As a result of the reactions to the 1990 article and its frequent citation by proponents of HGH as an anti-aging agent, in 2003 the New England Journal of Medicine published two articles that strongly and clearly stated that there was insufficient medical and scientific evidence to support use of HGH as anti-aging drug. One article was written by the Journal's then- editor in chief, Jeffrey M. Drazen, M.D. and was entitled, \\"Inappropriate Advertising of Dietary Supplements\\". It focused mostly on the advertising of dietary supplements. The other article was written by the editor-in-chief at the time the 1990 article was published, Mary Lee Vance, M.D., and was entitled, \\"Can Growth Hormone Prevent Aging?\\"; it focused more on the medical issues around whether there was sufficient evidence to use HGH as an anti- aging agent. A 2007 review on the use of human growth hormone as an anti-aging treatment in healthy elderly people published in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded the risks of HGH significantly outweigh the benefits, noted soft tissue edema as a common side effect and found no evidence that the hormone prolongs life. ABC News interviewed Hau Liu of Stanford University and lead author of the paper, who stated that people are paying thousands of dollars a year for a treatment that has not been proved to be beneficial and has many side effects. ABC News also reported that the A4A disputed the conclusions of this review, quoting from an A4A statement which maintained that growth hormone supplementation is beneficial in healthy adults and which described arguments against the use of the hormone as a \\"heinous act of malpractice\\". Some small studies have shown that low-dose GH treatment for adults with severe GH deficiency, such as that produced after surgical removal of the pituitary gland, produces positive changes in body composition by increasing muscle mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing bone density and muscle strength; improves cardiovascular parameters (i.e. decrease of LDL cholesterol), and improves quality of life without significant side effects. The extension of this approach to healthy elderly people is an area of current research, with a 2000 review in Hormone Research commenting that \\"Clearly more studies are needed before GH replacement for the elderly becomes established.\\" and noting that \\"safety issues will require close scrutiny\\". A 2008 review of the controversy surrounding the use of growth hormone in anti-aging medicine which published in Clinical Interventions in Aging noted the opinions of the A4A on this topic, but suggested that high levels of growth hormone might actually accelerate aging. This concern was repeated by the United States National Institute on Aging who stated in 2009 that: The Clinical Interventions in Aging review also stated that although the decreasing levels of the hormone seen in the elderly might reduce quality of life, this change could protect from age-related diseases and cited evidence linking GH to cancer. This concern was mirrored in a 2008 review published in Clinical Endocrinology, which stated that the risk of increasing the incidence of cancer was a strong argument against the use of this hormone as an \\"elixir of youth\\" in healthy adults. Legal disputes =Credential dispute= The Academy's co-founders include Klatz and Goldman, who are licensed osteopathic physicians and have Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degrees (D.O.). However, according to The New York Times, they also received M.D. degrees as doctors of medicine from a university in Belize in 1988, although the paper notes that they had not studied in Belize. In 2009 Klatz and Goldman stated that these degrees involved eight years of medical and surgical training and a year of clinical rotations. The New York Times reported that the Illinois State Board of Medical Registration did not recognize these MD degrees, and stated that the Board fined the men for using MD after their names. Writing in 2004, The Times stated that Klatz and Goldman \\"agreed to pay $5,000 penalties for allegedly identifying themselves as doctors of medicine in the state without being \\"properly licensed\\".\\" The Illinois Division of Professional Regulation disciplinary records state that Klatz and Goldman \\"agreed to cease and desist using the designation \\"M.D.\\" in addition to the appropriate \\"D.O.\\" title and fined $5,000. Both physicians did receive degrees as doctors of medicine, but were never properly licensed to use the title \\"M.D.\\" in Illinois\\"Illinois Department of Professional Regulation Monthly Disciplinary report for December 2000 Illinois Department of Financial & Professional Regulation, Accessed September 13, 2009 In 2009, Klatz and Goldman stated that Illinois Department of Financial & Professional Regulation had determined that they are currently: They go on to state that they have \\"valid M.D. degrees from a recognized medical school\\". Writing in 2004, the historian Carole Haber put this dispute into context, noting that \\"like the gland doctors before them, the leaders of the A4M have had their practices and credentials assailed by the medical and legal communities\\". =Regulatory and tort issues= Two articles in the Journal of the American Medical Association have stated that the use of growth hormone as an anti-aging product is illegal. However, Klatz and Goldman dispute this, arguing that this use of growth hormone is legal. The United States Department of Justice states that growth hormone is a potentially dangerous drug and its supply \\"for any use . . . other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the Secretary of Human Services\\" is a felony under the 1990 Anabolic Steroids Control Act.Human Growth Hormone/Steroids Statutory Overview United States Attorneys' Manual 1997, Accessed September 6, 2009 Similarly, the FDA has stated in a Warning Letter that no growth hormone products have been approved as anti-aging treatments and supply for this use is therefore illegal and an \\"offense punishable by not more than 5 years in prison\\".Warning Letter Department of Health and Human Services 2002, archived url, Accessed September 6, 2009 In 2007 The New York Times discussed ongoing federal and state investigations into illegal trafficking of human growth hormone and anabolic steroids, noting that \\"many of the individuals and companies cited in the indictments have been involved with the academy and its conventions over the years\\". However, the paper notes that the Academy is not accused of any wrongdoing as part of these investigations and quotes Klatz and Goldman as stating that \\"they barely knew the suspects or the nature of their businesses\\". A May 2000 article in the Los Angeles Times suggested that, from an examination of the disciplinary records of doctors in California, members of the A4M in this state were approximately ten times more likely to be disciplined than the national average. In the article, Klatz is quoted as commenting that:Benedict Cary Troubling Record for Anti-Aging Doctors Los Angeles Times May 8, 2000, Accessed September 22, 2009 =Wikipedia= According to lawyers claiming to act for A4M and one or more people involved with it, their clients had initiated \\"defamation actions in New York and Massachusetts\\" against Wikipedia editors in 2009. According to Courthouse News Service, the A4M co-founders Ronald Klatz and Robert Goldman are pursuing legal action against the online encyclopedia Wikipedia in New York County Court, seeking damages for alleged defamation.American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine v. Wikimedia, Citizen Media Law Project. =Dispute with Olshansky and Perls= In 2002, A4M was a co-recipient of the first \\"Silver Fleece Award,\\" created to publicize \\"the most ridiculous claims about antiaging medicine\\" according to the award's inventor, S. Jay Olshansky.R. J. Davenport, \\"And the Loser Is ...: Silver Fleece Awards 'honor' antiaging quackery (Questionable therapies)\\", Science's SAGE KE, February 20, 2002, Accessed January 12, 2015 Heated legal and academic controversies ensued. Olshansky, a biodemographer at the University of Illinois at Chicago, described it as \\"a lighthearted attempt to make the public aware of...anti-aging quackery\\". This \\"award\\" was presented by Olshansky, who stated that in his opinion, a \\"suite of anti-aging substances created by Ronald Klatz and Robert Goldman...and sold on the Internet by Market America, Inc.\\" had made \\"outrageous or exaggerated claims about slowing or reversing human aging\\". Writing in Biogerontology, anthropologist Courtney Mykytyn of the University of Southern California states that this award appears to have been an attempt by Olshansky to protect what he saw as \\"'real' science from the taint of swindle.\\" Mykytyn states that this involved Olshansky \\"tagging the A4M as fraudulent and its principals as profiteers\\". In response, the Academy filed defamation lawsuits, demanding $150 million in damages, with Klatz stating \\"We take great exception to Mr Olshansky and his tactics which have finally compelled us to file suit for various unprofessional and improper actions\\". Klatz and Goldman described this action as \\"part of a larger campaign of disparagement by Olshansky and Perls aimed at discrediting A4M and its founders\\". The Chicago Tribune quoted experts on libel law who stated that the action was an \\"almost unheard-of attempt to punish academics for comments made in their professional capacity\\".Jeremy Manier Professor sued over opinion of anti-aging group Chicago Tribune June 22, 2005, archived url, Accessed September 10, 2009 CNN states that Olshansky countersued and that \\"both sides eventually agreed to drop their cases\\".

In 2009, Imre Zs-Nagy of the University of Debrecen, Hungary, defended A4M from what he called the \\"gerontological establishment\\" in an editorial published in Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics, a journal Zs-Nagy founded and of which he is editor-in-chief. Zs-Nagy defended therapies promoted by A4M, which he states are related to his own \\"membrane hypothesis of aging\\", as theoretically feasible. He described the conflict between the scientific community and the Academy as one pitting government funds, \\"personal gain\\" and \\"intellectual dishonesty\\" against the \\"independent, open-minded approach\\" of A4M, calling the conflict one of the \\"biggest scandals of the recent history of medicine\\".

The larger animals such as the caribou would be eaten, with the skin used for tents and clothing and the sinew used for thread. In lean times even animals such as the fox would have been eaten and some people did eat it even when other foods were available. With the arrival of the traders the fox skin became a valuable source for trade, however, traditionally the skin was not often used except as a sanitary napkin. The skins of smaller animals such as the weasel would have been used to provide decoration on clothing. Some of the animals in this list, such as the lynx, are rarely seen as they live mainly in the very southern part of the territory away from any communities. There are several different dialects of Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun as well as two alphabets, Inuktitut syllabics and Latin. The Inuit name or spelling may differ from one region to another and in extreme cases from one community to another.

Biography Kautz was born in Georgetown, Ohio, one of seven children of Johann George and Dorothy Kautz. When a child, his family moved to Levanna, where they farmed, growing grapes and tobacco. Kautz entered the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, on September 28, 1854, and graduated with the rank of midshipman on June 11, 1858. He was promoted to passed midshipman on January 28, 1861, to master on February 28, then to lieutenant on April 21, 1861, soon after the start of the Civil War. Kautz served aboard the steamer , on blockade off Savannah, Georgia. On June 20, 1861, Flag captured the Confederate blockade runner Hannah Balch, and Kautz was given command of the prize, and ordered to take her to Philadelphia. However, his ship was recaptured by the Confederate privateer Coffee on June 25, and Kautz and his crew were taken prisoner. He gave his parole, and used his relative freedom to negotiate an exchange of prisoners. Finally, in November 1861, Kautz, John L. Worden, and another officer, plus 368 enlisted men were swapped for a similar number of Confederate prisoners. Eventually this process was formalised in the Dix–Hill Cartel of July 1862. Kautz then was assigned to David Farragut's flagship in the Gulf of Mexico, and took part in the campaign to capture New Orleans, forcing a passage up the Mississippi past Forts Jackson and St. Philip and arriving at the city on April 25, 1862. Farragut sent Captain Theodorus Bailey and Lieutenant George Perkins to meet John T. Monroe, the mayor of New Orleans, and demand the surrender of the city, the lowering of the state flag on the City Hall, and the raising of the flag of the United States over the Post Office, Custom House, and Mint. Monroe refused, claiming that only Major General Mansfield Lovell, the military commander in the city, had that authority. Lovell, however, having withdrawn his troops, passed the responsibility back to the civil authorities. Having failed in their mission Bailey and Perkins then had to leave City Hall by a back door, as an angry crowd attempted to kick down the front doors of City Hall, while calling for the two officers to be lynched. The next day, April 26, Kautz and Midshipman John H. Read were sent to the City Hall with a formal written demand for the city's surrender. They were forced to leave their 20-strong Marine escort behind on the waterfront, and were led through a hostile crowd by a police officer to a meeting with Mayor Monroe, who once again declined to surrender. At the same time men from had raised the Stars & Stripes over the Mint, which was promptly taken down by a group of citizens led by William B. Mumford, who ripped up the flag and flung it through the window of City Hall. For their own safety Kautz and Read left City Hall by a back door to a carriage, accompanied by Marion Baker, the mayor's secretary, and returned to their ship. Monroe continued to temporize, despite Farragut's threats to bombard the city, until news of the surrender of Forts Jackson and St. Philip arrived on April 29. That day Kautz and Captain Henry H. Bell landed with a detachment of sailors, a battalion of marines, and two boat howitzers, and raised the flag over the Custom House and City Hall. New Orleans was finally officially captured. He subsequently served aboard the steam sloop in the Gulf, and the steam gunboat . By early 1865, he was serving as executive officer of the sloop in the Pacific. Kautz was promoted to lieutenant commander on May 31, 1865, then to commander on September 3, 1872, and to captain on June 2, 1885. Promoted to commodore on 6 April 1897, he served as President of the Naval Examining and Retiring Boards until October 1897, then as commander of Naval Station Newport until October 1898. On October 24, 1898, Kautz was promoted to rear admiral, and was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Squadron. In March 1899, Kautz, flying his flag on , landed troops at Apia during the Second Samoan Civil War, and remained there until May. In February 1900 he transferred his flag to . Kautz retired in January 1901, and he and his wife moved to Florence, Italy. He died there on February 6, 1907, and his ashes were returned to the United States aboard for interment at Arlington National Cemetery. Personal life He married Esther Hemphill (1844–1922), the sister of Rear Admiral Joseph N. Hemphill, and had one son, Albert Hemphill Kautz (1871–1933).

It later appeared in Anderson's 1981 collection The Dark Between the Stars and the showcase The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century (2001). Plot At the beginning of the story, the protagonist (Iason Philippou) is exploring various parallel universes. Before the story began, he had visited our world's United States of which he had a very bad impression, considering it \\"a sick culture\\". He then come to the timeline where most of the plot is set. In that timeline, Christian Western Europe was overwhelmed in the tenth century by the combined onslaught of the Scandinavian Vikings from the north, the Magyars from the east and the Arabs from the south. Afterwards, the Arab Caliphate disintegrated in internal discord while the Vikings and Magyars, who kept their original religions, dominated Europe and eventually colonized North America. They developed a high technology, including nuclear energy, while keeping much of their Medieval culture and social structures. This North America, divided into numerous independent principalities, is much more sparsely populated than in our world, with large tracts of virtually untouched nature. While being social inferiors to the Scandinavians and Magyars, Native Americans in this timeline seem to have fared better than in our history. The story beings with Iason on the run, wanted in a Scandinavian realm where he had been a guest and where he had committed an unspecified offence serious enough to justify his being killed out of hand if caught. He makes his way to a Magyar realm where he asks for refuge. While Iason stays there, a Native American woman attempts to seduce him - but he refuses, stating that he is \\"under vow.\\" In fact, he is in hurry to meet the local Magyar ruler and get his firm vow that he would not be extradited, before his Scandinavian pursuers had the chance to talk to the Magyar. This caution was well founded - after talking to his Scandinavian counterpart, the Magyar ruler is furious with Iason, saying \\"You have sucked my vow out of me, if I had known what you had done I would have killed you myself!\\". However, the vow is unbreakable, and Iason gets transport to where he could finally get to back to his home universe - the self-styled \\"Eutopia\\" which gives the story its name, an Earth where classical Greece came to dominate the planet. He checks in with a superior (Daimonax) and complains of the barbarism of the people he has encountered, but Daimonax contradicts him, stating that people have different views on what it means to be civilized, and that Eutopia's carefully planned society may have lost the simple pleasures of life. The story ends as it is revealed that Iason had seduced and slept with a young boy (the son of his Scandinavian earlier host) before the opening of the story. The Scandinavian and Magyar culture have a strong taboo against homosexuality while Iason's world has kept the Classical Greek attitudes. At the conclusion it turns out that the \\"Niki\\" to whom the protagonist's thoughts keep turning is the nickname of Nikias, a young boy in Eutopia who is Iason's lover.

While many wine bars are private \\"stand-alone\\" establishments, in some cases, wine bars are associated with a specific wine retailer or other outlet of wine, to provide additional marketing for that retailer's wine portfolio.

Traditionally associated with cheeses and desserts, wine bars are looking to combine wine with appetizer- sized gourmet selections to enhance the palate. The concept brings the tastes of fancy restaurants to a dressed-down setting. Restaurant owners and chefs sometimes take the opposite approach and use wine bars as an opportunity for expansion.\\"Wine bar, redefined.\\" Restaurant Hospitality 2007 Dec.: 18.

Biography  He was born in Senigallia, the son of the Papal captain and lord of that city, Giovanni della Rovere, and of Giovanna da Montefeltro, daughter of Federico III da Montefeltro. He was also the nephew of Giuliano della Rovere, Pope Julius II. Portrait of Eleonora Gonzaga by Titian, 1538 His uncle Guidobaldo I of Urbino, who was heirless, called him at his court, and named him as heir of that dukedom in 1504 through the intercession of Julius II. In 1502 the della Rovere had lost the seigniory of Senigallia, occupied by Cesare Borgia, then the most powerful figure in the Marche: Francesco Maria and his mother were saved from the slaughter perpetrated by Borgia's troops by the then-land soldier Andrea Doria. When in 1508 Guidobaldo died, Francesco Maria became duke of Urbino; thanks to the support of his uncle the pope he could also recover Senigallia after Borgia's death. In 1508 he married Eleonora Gonzaga (1493–1570), daughter of Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua and Isabella d'Este. Figure from Raphael's The School of Athens (1509–11), possibly Francesco della Rovere, although others think it is the philosopher Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. In 1509 he was appointed as (commander-in-chief) of the Papal States, and subsequently fought in the Italian Wars against Ferrara and Venice. In 1511, after he had failed to conquer Bologna, he had the cardinal Francesco Alidosi killed by his troops, a cruel action for which he was compared to Borgia himself. In 1513 he was created also lord of Pesaro. However, the death of Julius II deprived him of his main political patron, and under the new pope, Leo X, Pesaro was given to the latter's nephew, Lorenzo II de' Medici. In 1516 he was excommunicated and ousted from Urbino, which he tried unsuccessfully to recover the following year. He could return in his duchy only after Leo's death in 1521. Portrait by Raphael as a teenager, 1504. Della Rovere fought as captain general of the Republic of Venice in Lombardy during the Italian Wars of 1521 (1523-1525), but with the new Medici Pope, Clement VII, the della Rovere were increasingly marginalized. As supreme commander of the Holy League, his inaction against the Imperial invasion troops is generally listed as one of the causes of the Sack of Rome (1527). He was a protagonist of the capture of Pavia in the late 1520s, and later fought for the Republic of Venice. Later he arranged the marriage of son Guidobaldo to Giulia da Varano (belonging to another former seigniory family of the region) to counter the Papal power in the Marche. He died in Pesaro, poisoned. Some scholars suggest that The Murder of Gonzago, an unknown play referenced in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, which is itself later reworked by Hamlet into The Mousetrap (the play within the play), may have been a popular theatrical reenactment of Della Rovere's death and may have been portrayed in England's early theaters during the Elizabethan Era.

A Dryobalanops aromatica canopy at FRIM showing crown shyness. The Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM; Malay: Institut Penyelidikan Perhutanan Malaysia) is a statutory agency of the Government of Malaysia, under the Ministry of Land, Water and Natural Resources (KATS). FRIM promotes sustainable management and optimal use of forest resources in Malaysia by generating knowledge and technology through research, development and application in tropical forestry. FRIM is located in Kepong, near Kuala Lumpur. FRIM is the world's oldest and largest re-created tropical rain forest.  History  In 1926, the chief conservator of the forest (equivalent to today's director of forestry), G.E.S Cubitt, asked F.W. Foxworthy to establish a separate forest research unit for the Forestry Department. It was Foxworthy who selected the present site, at Kepong. He was also to become the institute's first chief research officer. The site comprised an area that was practically stripped of its original forest cover except for a few remnant trees at the more inaccessible localities. Lalang-grass scrub on the hillsides made way to vegetable terraces on the lower slopes, while the valley cradled a few ponds, the left-overs of a past tin-mining operation. Within two years in 1928, the first of experimental plantation (mainly dipterocarps, tall hardwood species) were in place, carefully nurtured into being using \\"nurse\\" trees of other species as shade and food providers (being nitrogen-fixers). By that time the construction of the main building had begun. Completed the following years, this building was to remain the sole centre for the laboratories, herbarium, and museum, as well as the Chemistry, Zoology and Sivilculture sections of the institute, until new buildings were added after World War II. The herbarium collection, that was also moved to Kepong, numbered 1,500 accessions. The end of the decade saw some 125 hectares of plantation established at the institute. Plantation trials with exotic species started in the early 1930s. The plantations covered 154 hectares just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, and before the Japanese occupation of the Malay Peninsula in 1941–1945. By this time the dipterocarp and non-Dipterocarp arboreta contained 75 species (represented by 360 individual trees), while the Herbarium collection numbered nearly 40,000 accessions. = Establishment = Just before Malaysia won independence from the British Empire in 1957, some 220 hectares of plantations had been established at the institute, while the Dipterocarp and non- Dipterocarp arboreta held 201 and 168 species respectively. The herbarium collection had grown to 53,600 accessions. The Timber Research Branch had moved from Sentul to become a part of the institute at Kepong. Six years later, Encik Abdul Rahman Mohd. Ali was appointed the institute's first Malaysian director and chief research officer. The ground of the institute expanded by a further 192 hectares in 1962 and 1964 to total 600 hectares. In 1977 Dr. Salleh Mohd. Nor was appointed to his present post of director general of the institute. Eight years later, the institute was transformed into a statutory body. Through an Act of Parliament, the Malaysia Forestry Research and Development Board (MFRDB) was formed to administer the institute, which was now named FOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE of MALAYSIA (FRIM). This historic change was announced by the EX-Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Bin Muhammad when he visited FRIM on 11 June 1984. The formal inauguration of FRIM took place later, on 5 April 1986. =Objectives= # Generating scientific knowledge for the understanding, management, conservation and use of forest resources; # Research and development; # Studying biodiversity to produce useful products through intensive research and development; # Developing related technology to fulfil the needs of the forestry industry; # Packaging research and development findings for dissemination to clients; # Commercialising research and development findings through technology transfer to all interested parties; # Providing service to fulfil client needs; # Creating strategic co-operation with local and international agencies; # Raising public awareness regarding the importance of the environment and the conservation of forest biodiversity.

Their first church building was opened on October 21, 1883, a small wooden building. It was completed for $1000. A new, larger, building was constructed at the corner of Centre Street and Seventh Avenue. Designed to seat 330 people it was a stone construction which cost $8,000. As the congregation continued to expand, a subsequent building was erected in 1912 at the corner of Fourth Street and Sixth Avenue South. This is the site of the present day Knox United Church. The church split in 1925 after some members of the congregation voted to join with the United Church of Canada. Those who wished to remain in the Presbyterian Church went on to form a new, separate congregation. Current ministry The church has been at front of the movement to welcome gays, lesbians and transgender individuals into the United Church. In March 2007, after a vote at its annual congregational meeting, Knox became an affirming congregation, committed to work for the full inclusion and affirmation of all people in the life and work of the church. The church has one of the largest Casavant Frères organs in western Canada. This forms the centre of a strong music program. A permanent labyrinth was opened in 2005 and is open for daily meditations. The building is now also well known throughout the area as a venue for musical concerts of all kinds and is working to become more involved in the arts community in Calgary.

Tauras is a Lithuanian brewery, established in Vilnius in 1860. Tauras was taken over by Royal Unibrew in 2001. It is a part of Kalnapilis-Tauras Group.  History  The original brewery was founded in 1860 in Vilna, then in the Russian Empire. The firm was located in the borough of Lukiškės, right outside the city's limits. The original founders were two local Jewish entrepreneurs: Abel Sołowiejczyk and Iser Berg Wolf. However, around 1866 the brewery adopted the name of one of the founders' associates, Wilhelm Szopen, possibly because of the latter's surname being similar to the name of a highly popular Polish-French composer Fryderyk Chopin (sometimes written as Fryderyk Szopen in Polish). With time, Wilhelm Szopen indeed became the owner of the brewery, though its founders continued to run the daily business matters. Being merely one of many breweries in that part of Russian Empire, it competed with the breweries of the Lipski brothers, as well as Parczewski's brewery in Raudondvaris (then called Czerwony Dwór). However, with time it expanded significantly. By the early 1890s the firm had more than 50 workers and produced up to 300,000 buckets of beer - a common unit of measurement in brewing and vodka-making industry in 19th century Russia and corresponding to roughly 12.3 litres. In 1897 the brewery was taken over by Morduch Owsiej Epstein, a wealthy businessman. He combined the brewery with another local brewery he owned located in the Vilnian suburb of Popławy (modern Paupys, now a part of the city) and turned the company into a joint-stock company named Towarzystwo Akcyjne Browaru Szopen - Joint-stock Company of the Szopen Brewery. The new company had 0.5 million rubles at its disposal and hired up to 250 workers. Epstein significantly modernized the brewery and by 1909 it had four electrical motors and a diesel engine running the brewing process - a novelty in early-20th-century Europe. Such investments allowed for the brewery to almost monopolize the local market: the yearly production prior to World War I reached 800 thousand buckets, that is almost 10,000 hectolitres. Roughly half of beer sold in the local market was branded with Szopen's logo. After the war the company was experiencing difficulties. However, it continued to grow and send its beers to other towns within Poland. The capital stock rose to 810,000 złoty and new agencies were opened in Warsaw, Lida, Lwów and other towns. Although the Great Depression of late 1920s stroke the business, the yearly production rate continued to increase and reached 30,000 hectolitres in the early 1930s. The crisis also weakened the competitors, with Parczewski's brewery going bankrupt in 1930. This put the brewery, along with Warsaw's Haberbusch i Schiele and the Żywiec Brewery, among the 15 largest breweries in Poland. Following the German and Soviet invasion of Poland of 1939, the town of Vilnius was passed to Lithuania. The company name was Lithuanised to Šopen in 1940. However, later the same year Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union and the brewery, like all other privately owned companies, was nationalized. Merged with several smaller producers of beer and soft drinks, the company was renamed to its current name, Tauras Brewery, shortly after the end of World War II, in 1945. In 2001 Tauras Brewery was merged with Kalnapilis into AB “Kalnapilio – Tauro grupė”, owned by Danish Royal Unibrew. In 2006, it was decided to stop production in Vilnius and move it from Tauras brewery to Kalnapilis Brewery in Panevėžys.

Family James Butler, born on 24 November 1420, was the eldest son of James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, by his first wife, Joan de Beauchamp, Countess of Ormond (d. 3 or 5 August 1430). He had two younger brothers, John Butler, 6th Earl of Ormond, and Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond, as well as two sisters, Elizabeth Butler, who married John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, and Anne Butler (d. 4 January 1435), who was contracted to marry Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond, although the marriage appears not to have taken place. Career Ireland in 1450 showing the Earldom of Ormond. He was created Earl of Wiltshire, in the Peerage of England, by King Henry VI on 8 July 1449, for his fidelity to the Lancastrian interest. In 1451 he became Lord Deputy of Ireland; the next year he succeeded his father in the Earldom of Ormond and was additionally appointed Lord Lieutenant for ten years. From March to May 1455, he served as Lord High Treasurer of England and made a Knight of the Garter in 1459. Butler served as Lord High Treasurer again from 1458 to 1460. Butler's tenure as Lord High Treasurer occurred during the Great Bullion Famine and the Great Slump in England. By virtue of the rights of his wife, Avice, in the manor of Frome he exercised patronage of the chantry of St Andrew in the parish church at Frome in appointments made in 1452, 1453 and 1458. When the dynastic civil wars - known as the Wars of the Roses - broke out, Wiltshire fought on the Lancastrian side, becoming one of Queen consort Margaret of Anjou's staunchest supporters. He raised a significant force of Gaelic Irish troops to serve in England. He was present at the First Battle of St Albans in 1455, Battle of Wakefield in 1460, Battle of Mortimer's Cross in 1461 and at the Battle of Towton. Death He died on 1 May 1461, beheaded at Newcastle by the Yorkists after the Lancastrian army was soundly defeated at the Battle of Towton. He has been described by Dan Jones (The Hollow Crown) as \\"perhaps the greatest coward of his generation, (having) previously run away from the first battle of St. Albans and the battle of Mortimer's Cross. He brought his tally to three desertions by abandoning Towton, but this time his luck had run out\\". He was succeeded by his brother, John Butler, 6th Earl of Ormond.

It was built in 1895 for passenger ship services. It is situated on the eastern coast of the Isle of Purbeck, approximately south of Poole and east of Dorchester in the United Kingdom. An older pier, opened 1860, was used by local quarries to ship stone, but it fell into decline with only its timber piles remaining today. History Swanage Pier as seen from the Downs at the southern end of Swanage The first Swanage Pier, which was 750 feet long, was built between 1859 and 1860 for use primarily by the local stone quarrying industry and included a tramway which ran the length of the pier and some way along the seafront. The old tracks can be seen to this day, inset into the seafront walkways. When local businessman George Burt introduced regular steamer services between Swanage and nearby towns Poole and Bournemouth in 1874, a need became apparent for a second pier to be built primarily for use by passenger steamers. Construction on the new pier began in 1895, and by 1896 was first used by a steamer. The pier was officially opened for traffic on 29 March 1897. While regular steamer services ran on the new pier up until 1966, the older original pier declined along with the stone industry it served some years earlier. Today all that remains of the old pier are some of the timber piles. After steamer services discontinued in 1966 the remaining pleasure pier also began to fall into disrepair. In 1976 Grade II listed status was awarded to the pier. After a failed attempt to restore the pier by a development firm in 1986, Swanage Pier Trust took over ownership of the pier in 1994. The Trust took on the task of raising over £1,000,000 needed to carry out major restoration work on the pier's piles, timbers and ironwork fittings. It was reopened in 1998. The pier today Swanage Pier at dusk Today the pier is open to the public once again. Small scale ferry services run daily throughout the summer season, mainly to Poole Quay. The pier also hosts a successful diving school, the oldest in the UK, and is visited annually by historic steamers including the Waverley paddle steamer. The pier is a popular training site for scuba diving because it is one of the few sheltered marine diving sites on the south coast, and it has depths of only . The Marine Conservation Society South East also use the pier as a location for its training dives during their Marine identification and underwater photography courses, due to the wide range of marine life found under the pier.

Software is itself a resource and thus must be afforded appropriate security. Since the number of threats specifically targeting software is increasing, the security of our software that we produce or procure must be assured. \\"Dependence on information technology makes software assurance a key element of business continuity, national security, and homeland security.\\"Karen Mercedes, Theodore Winograd \\"Enhancing The Development Life Cycle To Produce Secure Software\\" , Data & Analysis Center for Software, October 2008  What is software security assurance?  Software Security Assurance (SSA) is the process of ensuring that software is designed to operate at a level of security that is consistent with the potential harm that could result from the loss, inaccuracy, alteration, unavailability, or misuse of the data and resources that it uses, controls, and protects. The software security assurance process begins by identifying and categorizing the information that is to be contained in, or used by, the software. The information should be categorized according to its sensitivity. For example, in the lowest category, the impact of a security violation is minimal (i.e. the impact on the software owner's mission, functions, or reputation is negligible). For a top category, however, the impact may pose a threat to human life; may have an irreparable impact on software owner's missions, functions, image, or reputation; or may result in the loss of significant assets or resources. Once the information is categorized, security requirements can be developed. The security requirements should address access control, including network access and physical access; data management and data access; environmental controls (power, air conditioning, etc.) and off- line storage; human resource security; and audit trails and usage records. What causes software security problems? All security vulnerabilities in software are the result of security bugs, or defects, within the software. In most cases, these defects are created by two primary causes: (1) non- conformance, or a failure to satisfy requirements; and (2) an error or omission in the software requirements. =Non-conformance, or a failure to satisfy requirements= A non-conformance may be simple-the most common is a coding error or defect-or more complex (i.e., a subtle timing error or input validation error). The important point about non-conformance is that verification and validation techniques are designed to detect them and security assurance techniques are designed to prevent them. Improvements in these methods, through a software security assurance program, can improve the security of software. =Errors or omissions in software requirements= The most serious security problems with software-based systems are those that develop when the software requirements are incorrect, inappropriate, or incomplete for the system situation. Unfortunately, errors or omissions in requirements are more difficult to identify. For example, the software may perform exactly as required under normal use, but the requirements may not correctly deal with some system state. When the system enters this problem state, unexpected and undesirable behavior may result. This type of problem cannot be handled within the software discipline; it results from a failure of the system and software engineering processes which developed and allocated the system requirements to the software.  Software security assurance activities  There are two basic types of Software Security Assurance activities. #Some focus on ensuring that information processed by an information system is assigned a proper sensitivity category, and that the appropriate protection requirements have been developed and met in the system. #Others focus on ensuring the control and protection of the software, as well as that of the software support tools and data. At a minimum, a software security assurance program should ensure that: #A security evaluation has been performed for the software. #Security requirements have been established for the software. #Security requirements have been established for the software development and/or operations and maintenance (O&M;) processes. #Each software review, or audit, includes an evaluation of the security requirements. #A configuration management and corrective action process is in place to provide security for the existing software and to ensure that any proposed changes do not inadvertently create security violations or vulnerabilities. #Physical security for the software is adequate.  Building in security  Improving the software development process and building better software are ways to improve software security, by producing software with fewer defects and vulnerabilities. A first-order approach is to identify the critical software components that control security-related functions and pay special attention to them throughout the development and testing process. This approach helps to focus scarce security resources on the most critical areas. = Tools and techniques = There are many commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software packages that are available to support software security assurance activities. However, before they are used, these tools must be carefully evaluated and their effectiveness must be assured. = Common weaknesses enumeration = One way to improve software security is to gain a better understanding of the most common weaknesses that can affect software security. With that in mind, there is a current community-based program called the Common Weaknesses Enumeration project, which is sponsored by The Mitre Corporation to identify and describe such weaknesses. The list, which is currently in a very preliminary form, contains descriptions of common software weaknesses, faults, and flaws. =Security architecture/design analysis= Security architecture/design analysis verifies that the software design correctly implements security requirements. Generally speaking, there are four basic techniques that are used for security architecture/design analysis. Logic analysis Logic analysis evaluates the equations, algorithms, and control logic of the software design. Data analysis Data analysis evaluates the description and intended usage of each data item used in design of the software component. The use of interrupts and their effect on data should receive special attention to ensure interrupt handling routines do not alter critical data used by other routines. Interface analysis Interface analysis verifies the proper design of a software component's interfaces with other components of the system, including computer hardware, software, and end-users. Constraint analysis Constraint analysis evaluates the design of a software component against restrictions imposed by requirements and real-world limitations. The design must be responsive to all known or anticipated restrictions on the software component. These restrictions may include timing, sizing, and throughput constraints, input and output data limitations, equation and algorithm limitations, and other design limitations. =Secure code reviews, inspections, and walkthroughs= Code analysis verifies that the software source code is written correctly, implements the desired design, and does not violate any security requirements. Generally speaking, the techniques used in the performance of code analysis mirror those used in design analysis. Secure Code reviews are conducted during and at the end of the development phase to determine whether established security requirements, security design concepts, and security-related specifications have been satisfied. These reviews typically consist of the presentation of material to a review group. Secure code reviews are most effective when conducted by personnel who have not been directly involved in the development of the software being reviewed. Informal reviews Informal secure code reviews can be conducted on an as-needed basis. To conduct an informal review, the developer simply selects one or more reviewer(s) and provides and/or presents the material to be reviewed. The material may be as informal as pseudo-code or hand-written documentation. Formal reviews Formal secure code reviews are conducted at the end of the development phase for each software component. The client of the software appoints the formal review group, who may make or affect a \\"go/no-go\\" decision to proceed to the next step of the software development life cycle. Inspections and walkthroughs A secure code inspection or walkthrough is a detailed examination of a product on a step-by-step or line- by-line (of source code) basis. The purpose of conducting secure code inspections or walkthroughs is to find errors. Typically, the group that does an inspection or walkthrough is composed of peers from development, security engineering and quality assurance. =Security testing= Software security testing, which includes penetration testing, confirms the results of design and code analysis, investigates software behaviour, and verifies that the software complies with security requirements. Special security testing, conducted in accordance with a security test plan and procedures, establishes the compliance of the software with the security requirements. Security testing focuses on locating software weaknesses and identifying extreme or unexpected situations that could cause the software to fail in ways that would cause a violation of security requirements. Security testing efforts are often limited to the software requirements that are classified as \\"critical\\" security items.

Technique Description Tomoe nage is performed by the attacker (tori) gripping the opponent (uke) high and falling backward as in a backward roll. Once uke is off balance forward, tori plants a foot low on uke at waist level and applies strong pressure, rolling onto his own back with uke above him. This causes uke to flip over tori and land on his back. The final position is both practitioners are on their backs, head to head. Variations that maintain the high grip and complete the backward roll allow tori to mount uke at the completion of the throw.

Melchor de Talamantes (in full, Melchor de Talamantes Salvador y Baeza) (January 10, 1765, Lima, Viceroyalty of Peru - May 9, 1809, Veracruz, Mexico), was a Mercedarian friar and priest, a political liberal, and a leader in Mexico's movement for independence from Spain.Guedea, Virginia. \\"Melchor de Talamantes\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 5, p. 196. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Early life At the age of 14, Talamantes entered the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy. He obtained his doctorate of theology from the University of San Marcos. Afterwards he served as a high official in the Archdiocese of Lima, and for two years as an assistant to Viceroy of Peru, Francisco Gil de Taboada. During this time he came to know Hipólito Unanue, a fighter for the independence of America. In 1796 Talamantes asked for his release from the Order, to become a secular priest. This was because his reading of forbidden books and his libertarian tendencies had led to difficulties with his religious superiors. He also asked to be transferred to Spain, by way of New Spain (Mexico). The second request was granted on September 20, 1798 and he left from Guayaquil for Mexico, arriving at Acapulco on November 26, 1799.8 August Career in Mexico Talamantes took up residence at the convent of his Order in Mexico City, where he dedicated himself to reading and meditation. On October 15, 1802 he delivered the lecture Panegyric of the glorious virgin and doctor, Saint Teresa of Jesús, which was printed, with permission, in the same year. On November 18 he delivered in the cathedral of the city the Funeral Oracion for the Spanish soldiers killed during the war. In 1806 Viceroy José de Iturrigaray commissioned him to report on the boundaries between Texas (New Spain) and Louisiana.Guedea. \\"Melchor de Talamantes\\" p. 196. Talamantes began attending gatherings and political meetings. He made friends of radical Criollos, played cards, contracted debts, and neglected his religious offices. He was named censor of the Diario de México, and came to have great influence in official circles, particularly in the Ayuntamiento (city government of Mexico City). He was now the intellectual leader of the Criollo faction. In 1808, after the French invasion of Spain, the Criollos and some of the Spanish living in New Spain wanted to proclaim the independence of the colony and establish a governing junta, similar to the anti-French juntas in the mother country. On September 1, 1808, Talamantes delivered two tracts to the Ayuntamiento, in favor of separation from Spain and of the convoking of a Mexican congress. These tracts, Congreso Nacional del Reino de Nueva España (23 August 1808) and Representación Nacional de las Colonias, Discuso Filosófico (25 August 1808) argue that Spain had lost its sovereignty and that New Spain had the right to repossess it.Hamnett, Brian. The End of Iberian Rule on the American Continent, 1770-1830. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2017, pp. 122-23 His premises were that all ties to Spain had now been broken; that regional laws had to be made, independently of the mother country; that the Audienciacould not speak on behalf of the king; and that the king having disappeared, sovereignty was now vested in the people. His proposed congress was to represent all the provinces of New Spain. It was to be invested with the legislative authority of the new government. The courts already established were to exercise the judicial power, and Viceroy Iturrigaray was to be captain general (commander of the military) and, provisionally, chief executive. This was the government of a republic; there was no provision for a king. Viceroy Iturrigaray was perceived to have some sympathy for this path, and, because of that, peninsular Spaniards opposed to that plan arrested the viceroy on the night of September 15, 1808. An investigation of the papers of Talamantes revealed him to be a leader in the movement. Many radical political tracts written by him were found in his house. Also many books were found, including some banned ones (for instance the works of Montesquieu and Adam Smith). The detention of the viceroy and the others was followed by legal charges and physical cruelties. Talamantes was brought before a biased court. He was denied a lawyer. His enemies, among whom were members of his religious order, accused him of \\"disloyalty to the king and adhesion to the doctrines of independence\\". His trial lasted more than six months. He was convicted and sentenced to death, then ordered transferred to Spain for the execution of the sentence. Fray Talamantes died of yellow fever in San Juan de Ulúa, Veracruz as he was being transferred in chains and under guard to Spain.Guedea, \\"Melchor de Talamantes\\", p. 196. He was provided no medical assistance, and indeed his chains were not removed until the moment of his burial, in a common grave. He is honored today in Mexico as one of the protomartyrs of independence. References Further reading *Hernández Silva, Héctor Cuauhtémoc and Juan Manuel Pérez Zevallos, eds.

That is, the information systems department did not create it, was not aware of it, and does not support it. Overview Shadow systems (a.k.a. shadow data systems, data shadow systems, shadow information technology, shadow accounting systemsImplementing Shadow Accounting Systems or in short: Shadow IT) consist of small scale databases and/or spreadsheets developed for and used by end users, outside the direct control of an organization's IT department. The design and development process for these systems tends to fall into one of two categories. In the first case, these systems are developed on an adhoc basis rather than as part of a formal project and are not tested, documented or secured with the same rigor as more formally engineered reporting solutions. This makes them comparatively quick and cheap to develop, but unsuitable in most cases for long term use. In the second case, the systems are developed by experienced software developers that are not part of the organization's information systems department. These systems may be off-the-shelf software products or custom solutions developed by contract programmers. Depending on the expertise of the developers, these solutions may exceed the reliability of those created by the organization's information systems department. The term can also refer to legitimate, managed replicas of operational databases that are isolated from the user base of the main system. These sub-systems can be used to track illegitimate changes to the primary data-store by 'back doors' exploited by expert but un-authorized users. As stated in Price Waterhouse CoopersPrice Waterhouse Coopers report on Spreadsheet Risk Management \\"The Use of Spreadsheets: Considerations for Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\\" : \\"Many companies rely on spreadsheets as a key component in their financial reporting and operational processes. However, it is clear that the flexibility of spreadsheets has sometimes come at a cost. It is important that management identify where control breakdowns could lead to potential material misstatements and that controls for significant spreadsheets be documented, evaluated and tested. And, perhaps more importantly, management should evaluate whether it is possible to implement adequate controls over significant spreadsheets to sufficiently mitigate this risk, or if spreadsheets related to significant accounts or with higher complexity should be migrated to an application system with a more formalized information technology control environment.\\"  Cause  An organization that has a centralized Information Services department usually requires rigorous guidelines for developing a new system or application. Simultaneously, with the rise of powerful desktop applications that give savvy end-users the ability to author sophisticated tools on their own, a business group often finds it more expedient to create the application themselves. =Pressure to analyze information in new ways= Any organization faces a multitude of pressures to change and respond to new government regulations, customer demands and action by competitors. In order to respond to these changes, organizations need to be able to understand all aspects of their business and often ask questions of itself that have never been asked before. Ongoing pressure for change creates an ongoing pressure to analyze data in new ways and get information quickly into the hands of people who need it. Only through creative and flexible reporting are businesses able to spot new trends and identify new opportunities rapidly enough to take full advantage of them. The type of data analysis that most frequently necessitates the development or purchase of Shadow Systems usually comes from the needs of the user. Since the centralized information systems department usually reports to the organization’s CFO or COO, the systems that they develop are designed for their needs. The needs of departmental managers are often quite different, requiring more detailed analysis that incorporate variables not contained in the solution designed by the central information systems department. =Increased power of personal computer hardware and software= The greatly increased power of personal computer hardware and software analysis tools has meant that individual users now have all of the computing power they need right in front of them. Large databases containing all of an organization's customer, supplier, or accounting information; the kind that could once only be stored on a central corporate mainframe, can now be contained easily on a single laptop. =Rigorous controls and the breadth of required skills leads to unresponsive information technology or IT departments= Quite properly, when a reporting system is put together by IT professionals, they need to consider all aspects of how the system will be used. In addition to just putting the information together they need to consider the following: * How can it be ensured that the data produced is accurate? * Who is authorized to see this information? How can security be enforced? * How is the system to be backed up/replicated in case of failure? * User documentation must be written so that the system can be given to new users. * Technical documentation must be produced so that support staff can maintain it. * The load that any new tool places on existing systems needs to be managed and minimized. The various skills that are required to achieve all of this means that inevitably a number of different people will all be involved in the task of creating the new report. This increases the amount of time and effort it takes to put a rigorously engineered solution in place. Shadow Systems typically ignore this kind of rigor, making them much faster to implement, but less reliable and more difficult to maintain.  Problems  When Shadow Data Systems are created by end users whose main area of expertise is something other than software engineering, they are subject to the following problems: =Poorly designed= Shadow Data Systems often suffer from poor design. Errors may be hard to find, modifications may be difficult, and long-term support may be troublesome. =Not scalable= Typically, Shadow Data Systems are only used by one or two people. Unless they are developed by experienced programmers, it may be difficult to scale them up to support tens or hundreds of users. =Poorly documented= Shadow Data Systems are often lack adequate documentation. Knowledge about the system is passed by word-of-mouth and can be confined to a very small number of people. This knowledge is then lost completely if one or two staff members leave. =Untested= Around two thirds of the effort involved in professional software development is expended in testing. Shadow Data Systems undergo much more cursory testing and may have latent errors that only become apparent after a long period of production use. =May allow unauthorized access to sensitive information= Shadow Data Systems hold substantial chunks of company data and can include confidential information about customers, suppliers or staff. The access control processes for these systems are often much more lax than for a centralized company database and may not even exist at all. Physically locating sensitive data on desktop or laptop computers can leave an organization very exposed if the computer is stolen. =Easy to introduce errors= Data in local databases and spreadsheets can very easily be modified, either intentionally or otherwise. Once changed it can be hard to track what changes have been made and what the original data looked like. Where the system manipulates the data it can introduce more subtle errors that remain completely undetected for long periods. =Back up= Shadow systems existing on a single computer are often not regularly backed up. It is best to have these systems on a computer that is regularly backed up or on a server. =Several versions of the truth= There may be many different shadow systems within an organization reporting against the same data. Each one may add filters and manipulate the data in different ways. This can lead to apparent inconsistencies in their output. Where two shadow systems disagree, either or both of them may be wrong.  Advantages  When Shadow Data Systems are created by an experienced programmer or software engineer with significant input from departmental management, the resulting solution frequently exceeds the capability of those created by the organizations centralized information systems department. The experience of the programmer / software engineer easily removes most of the previously stated problems. And, when combined with input of departmental management, the resulting product actually meets the needs of the end user.

Geography =Location= The community's main centre lies south-southeast of Bamberg where the Reiche Ebrach empties into the Regnitz. For various reasons, among them the community's favourable location on the A 73 and its close proximity to Bamberg (12 km), Forchheim (13 km), Erlangen (about 30 km), Fürth (about 40 km) and Nuremberg (about 50 km), Hirschaid has grown markedly since the 1960s. =Constituent communities= Hirschaid's main and namesake centre is by far the biggest of its Gemeindeteile with a population of 5,747. The community furthermore has these outlying centres, each given here with its own population figure: *Erlach 417 *Friesen bei Hirschaid 323 *Großbuchfeld 105 *Juliushof 27 *Kleinbuchfeld 124 *Köttmannsdorf bei Hirschaid 684 *Ortsteil Regnitzau (population included with main centre's) *Röbersdorf 786 *Rothensand 306 *Sassanfahrt 2118 *Seigendorf 789 (as of 1 January 2005) Ironically, Großbuchfeld (“Great Beech Field”) is actually smaller than Kleinbuchfeld (“Little Beech Field”). History The community's name goes back to the von Hirzheide noble family whose coat of arms were charged with a hart, still seen in the community's arms today. Hirschaid lies not far from the former via regia, an ancient road that since antiquity joined the north in the area around Lüneburg with the south all the way to Lower Austria. The name Hirschaid refers to the former landscape and wildlife (Hirsch is “hart” in German). Finds dug up on the Regnitz Valley terraces bear witness to an early settlement beginning no later than the New Stone Age. Bearing witness to the later La Tène culture (Celtic) are above all the finds and wall remains on the nearby Friesener Warte In 1079, Hirschaid became historical for the first time through a document issued by King Heinrich IV. In 1979, this date was duly celebrated in the community's 900th anniversary celebration. From 1300, it was the seat of the Lords, ministeriales and Vögte (sing. Vogt – reeve) of Hirzheide. Their Frankish line died out in 1590, although a Swedish-Livonian line still lives today. The coat of arms that they bore then, showing a golden hart in silver climbing out of a blue three-knolled hill (a charge called a Dreiberg in German heraldry), foreshadowed the one now borne by the community. Although Hirschaid was mostly spared in the German Peasants' War, the community, lying on the main through road, was hard hit in the Thirty Years' War. A chronicler reports from this time: “After Candlemas 1633 the Swedes also came here and dwelt in the Swedish way. They plundered and robbed whatever they could get; nothing was holy to them. The House of God had its windows and doors beaten in, the inside was demolished, the bells taken away and broken up...” Further plunderings had to be suffered in the Seven Years' War and especially in the Napoleonic Wars, when on 6 August 1793 a heavy cavalry and artillery battle broke out right near the community between the Imperial Army and French troops. With Secularization, Hirschaid, which had been assigned to the tithing area of Eggolsheim, passed along with its 105 “autonomous houses” to Bavaria. The building of the Ludwig Danube-Main Canal in 1834 and the opening of the Nuremberg-Bamberg railway line in 1844 yielded the first industrial incentives for Hirschaid. Basket weaving, which was introduced about this time, offered others work and a livelihood. About 1900, the population had grown to roughly 1,120, and the number of houses to 173. Because of its favourable location, determined by the railway station on the Nuremberg-Bamberg railway line and the community's lying right near the highways, but also by administrative reform in 1972, the market community of Hirschaid with its constituent communities has grown to have more than 11,000 inhabitants and is developing itself appreciably into a small transport and economic centre. =Religion= * Roman Catholic: 80% * Evangelical Lutheran: 10% * Other, no religion: 10% All figures are rough. Politics =Community council= The community council is made up of 24 members, listed here by party or voter community affiliation, and also with the number of seats that each holds: * CSU 12 * Wählergemeinschaft Sassanfarth-Köttmannsdorf-Rothensand 3 * Fortschrittlicher Bürgerblock 2 * Wählergemeinschaft Hirschaid 2 * Wählergemeinschaft Regnitzau 2 * SPD 1 * Ökologische Liste Hirschaid 1 * Liste der Frauen 1 =Coat of arms= Hirschaid's arms might heraldically be described thus: In argent a mullet of eight azure halved per fess emerging therefrom above a hart attired springing sable.

Earth Charter Youth Program  The Earth Charter Youth program is a network of youth NGOs and young activists who share a common interest in sustainable development and the Earth Charter. Severn Cullis-Suzuki from Vancouver, Canada was nominated as youth representative in the Earth Charter Commission, which oversaw the drafting process. At the age of 17, Severn participated in the Earth Summit of 1997 and made sure that concerns of young people were taken seriously in the process of drafting the Earth Charter. She contributed to the inclusion of principle 12c in the final version of the Earth Charter which stresses the need to: “Honor and support the young people of our communities, enabling them to fulfill their essential role in creating sustainable societies.” The launch of the Earth Charter Youth program was inspired by this ethical principle. Today there are two youth representatives on the Earth Charter International Council.

Rakshitha, Sayaji Shinde, and Rahul Dev play important roles. Music was composed by Chakri while cinematography was handled by Shyam K. Naidu. This film was simultaneously made in Kannada as Veera Kannadiga with Puneeth Rajkumar, directed by Meher Ramesh. The film created much hype as Jr. NTR was acting in this film just after the blockbuster Simhadri.  Plot  Shankar Pehalvan (Jr. NTR) is a labour leader from Andhra in Mumbai. He fights with mafia don Bade Mia (Sayaji Shinde). However, Bade Mia later kills Shankar and his wife (Sanghavi). Basha (Banerjee), a trusted lieutenant of Shankar, takes away his child to rescue him from Bade Mia. When mafia goons follow him, Basha leaves the child on a footpath besides a beggar. The boy, Munna (Jr. NTR), is raised in a slum area. While Basha is in search of Munna to safeguard him, Bade Mia is in search of him to avenge the death of his son (Mahesh Goyani) in the hands of Shankar. Thanks to the similarities in appearance of father and son, Basha and Bade Mia recognize that Munna is Shankar's son. Munna gets to know his identity and the story of his father and his death from Basha. Meanwhile, Bade Mia's men descend to Hyderabad to kill Munna. Munna goes to Mumbai to confront Bade Mia.

The piece draws many lyrical and imagistic threads from Thomas' entire recorded legacy, as well as relying to a large degree on improvisation and the personalities of its participants. The cast is typically large and diverse, featuring actors, poets and singers supported by a core musical group (based around Thomas' regular collaborators the Two Pale Boys). Set in an abstract highway landscape among anonymous all-night coffee shops, bus stops, roadside detritus, apocryphal road signs, and flickering streetlights, Mirror Man is (according to Thomas) \\"about places that don't exist and a collection of stories about the people who live there -- abandoned by the future, forbidden access to the past, and set adrift in a mirage-like Now\\". Theatrical production The work was initially commissioned by The South Bank, London, and premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on April 3, 1998 as part of the four-day festival David Thomas: Disastodrome!. Since that time it has been restaged at various festivals, and briefly toured the UK in 2001. The most recent staging was at a second Disastodrome! Festival in Los Angeles, in February 2003. Act 1 is entitled \\"Jack and the General\\", referring respectively to Jack Kerouac, and General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and supposes a poetic correlation of the two men via their relationship to the US Interstate Highway System. Act 2 is \\"Surf's Up in Bay City\\". Bay City is \\"where the journey ends, where the unstoppable Great Westward Urge meets the immovable Pacific Object and loses.\\" Album Mirror Man is performed in two acts. The album was recorded primarily live at the debut performance (with some fixes and alternate performances patched in), and comprises the first act (\\"Jack and the General\\"). The second act (\\"Surf's Up in Bay City\\"), which has undergone significant rewrites as the piece has evolved through different stagings, has not been released, though the lyrical and musical content of the most recent incarnation overlaps significantly with both the David Thomas and Two Pale Boys album Surf's Up!, and the David Thomas and Foreigners album Bay City. Due to the fluid and continuous nature of the performance, the album is tracked in a non-traditional manner. There are eleven track points spread across the fifteen distinct songs performed, each roughly, though not exactly, corresponding to the major transition points within the work.

S. Rajamouli. The film was presented by V. Doraiswamy Raju and produced by V. Vijay Kumar Varma for the production company VMC Combines. The film stars Jr. NTR, Bhumika Chawla, and Ankitha in lead roles with Mukesh Rishi, Nassar, and Rahul Dev portraying supporting roles. The film's story was penned by Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad and the dialogues were penned by M. Rathnam. The cinematography and editing for the film was handled by Ravindra Babu and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao respectively. The film ended up as one of the blockbusters of that year.  Plot  An orphan and good-hearted lad Simhadri (NTR) is 'adopted' and grows up under Ram Bhupal Varma's (Nassar) family care in Visakhapatnam. The bond they share is like father and son. Kasturi (Ankitha) is Varma's granddaughter, and she likes Simhadri a lot. Once a week, Simhadri visits a mentally challenged girl called Indu (Bhumika Chawla). He entertains her and provides money to her caretakers (Rallapalli and Ragini). When Varma and his wife (Sangeeta) discover Kasturi's wish to marry Simhadri, Varma decides to get them married. He makes a formal announcement to officially adopt Simhadri. At this time, it is revealed that Simhadri is very close to Indu. The alliance breaks off when Simhadri refuses to leave Indu (who is suspected to be his mistress). Meanwhile, two separate groups are in search of Simhadri. They find him at the banks of Godavari River along with Indu. In the ensuing confrontation between one group of gangsters and Simhadri, Varma and his family are surprised to see that Simhadri, who used to be calm and composed, is ruthlessly killing many rowdies without mercy. Meanwhile, Indu gets injured. Simhadri is helped by the second group who call him 'Singamalai Anna' (Brother Singamalai). When Indu comes back to her senses, she remembers her past and the first thing she does is stab Simhadri with an iron pole. Simhadri is hospitalized in critical condition. Then we see many buses carrying hoards of people demanding to see 'Singamalai Anna'. The leader of the second group who was searching for Simhadri explains 'Singamalai Anna' story in a flashback. In the flashback, it is revealed that Varma's oldest daughter Saraswati (Seetha) elopes with her lover, a Keralite named Aravind (Bhanu Chander). After some harsh words and saddened over Varma's rejection over her choice to marry her love, they both settle in Kerala. Learning of the sadness surrounding Varma and his wife, Simhadri takes up the job of uniting the family and visits Thiruvananthapuram. He joins the medical and spiritual therapy spa operated by Saraswati and her family under the disguise of a patient. He finds that Indu is Varma's first granddaughter. He convinces the separated family to reunite and ask for forgiveness. During this time, Saraswati is killed by a local goon Bala Nair (Rahul Dev). A don named Bhai Saab (Mukesh Rishi) controls the mafia of Kerala. Bala and Bhai belong to the same mafia. Simhadri takes the law into his hands and eradicates Bala and his small gang in Kerala. The local Kerala people start calling him 'Singamalai'. In the ensuing scenes, Simhadri finds himself developing into \\"Singamalai,\\" eradicating Bhai Saab's network and illegal activities. Indu finds herself alone and constantly worrying about him. She proposes to her father that they should return to Andhra Pradesh because she cannot stand their home without her mother and Simhadri ignores her now. Indu and Aravind decide to return to Visakhapatnam. Simhadri receives a call that Indu's father is carrying a bomb in his briefcase. Aravind is seen rushing to catch a moving train, and Indu was about to lend him a hand. Unable to warn him, Simhadri has two choices: to let Indu's father die so people on the train can live, or let the bomb kill everyone on board, including Indu and her father.

Biography Weissman was born in the Bronx on July 12, 1919. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School, he studied business at the City College of New York (whose business school became Baruch College), edited a small weekly newspaper in New Jersey and then became a reporter for The Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey. The day after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Navy and, during World War II, served for more than three years as a submarine destroyer commander and on an anti-personnel naval ship. Following military service, he made a career change to public relations, first working at Samuel Goldwyn Productions and later becoming a public relations consultant at Benjamin Sonnenberg, where Philip Morris was a client.Martin, Douglas. \\"George Weissman, Leader at Philip Morris and in the Arts in New York, Dies at 90 \\", The New York Times, July 27, 2009. Retrieved July 28, 2009. In 1952, Weissman joined Philip Morris as assistant to the president and director of public relations. The next year, he was elected vice-president of the company, handling not only public relations and market research, but also new product development and packaging. He joined the board of directors in 1958 and went on to become chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Philip Morris International, leading its expansion overseas. He was appointed president of the corporation in 1967, vice-chairman in 1973 and chairman and chief executive officer in 1978. Weissman retired in 1984, but continued to serve the company in various advisory roles. He also joined the board of directors of Gulf+Western, which later became Paramount Communications, a position he held for the next decade. His marketing inspiration came from William K. Howell, who is credited with the success of Marlboro cigarettes and the Miller Brewing Company. Howell and Weissman introduced the Marlboro Man, an advertising figure who help propel Philip Morris to a leading position in the tobacco industry. Weissman's volunteer pursuits included serving as board chairman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, founding board member of Jazz at Lincoln Center, a trustee of the Whitney Museum, and a director of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry. His political work landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. Baruch College's Weissman School of Arts and Sciences is named for him and his wife, Mildred. He died at age 90 on July 24, 2009 in Greenwich, Connecticut, due to declining health, exacerbated by an accidental fall at his home in Rye, New York.

Fields was born in Humble, a northern suburb of Houston, to Mr. and Mrs. Jack Fields Sr. He graduated from Humble High School in his hometown in 1970. Fields earned both Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor degrees from Baptist-affiliated Baylor University and Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas, in 1974 and 1977, respectively. After being admitted to the Texas bar in 1977, Fields worked as a lawyer in private practice and as a vice president of a family-owned business through 1980. Congressional career In 1980, at the age of twenty-eight, Fields was elected to the U.S. House on the coattails of President Ronald Reagan's electoral victory. He narrowly defeated 8th District incumbent Bob Eckhardt, a seven-term Democrat, by only 4,900 votes to become the first Republican to represent what is now the 8th in 83 years. After the 1980 census, most of the 8th's more Democratic areas were cut out, and Fields was reelected seven more times without serious difficulty. When the Republican Party assumed majority control of the House of Representatives in the 1994 elections, Fields was elected chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Committee on Commerce. In that role, he was one of the principal authors of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 1993 special Senate election In 1993, Fields joined a field of 24 candidates in a special election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Lloyd Bentsen, when Bentsen was appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton as the secretary of the treasury. However, Fields failed to win enough votes to advance to a runoff election. In the Senate race, Fields divided the pro-life vote with fellow U.S. Representative Joe Barton. The Fields-Barton split propelled State Treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison, who supported the United States Supreme Court Roe v. Wade abortion decision, into the runoff with appointed incumbent Democratic Senator Robert Krueger. Two former governors divided their support between Fields and Barton. John B. Connally Jr. supported Fields, in part because Connally was from Houston. Bill Clements endorsed Barton, whose home in Ennis is not far from Clements' home in Dallas. Post-congressional career Fields did not run for reelection to the 106th Congress in 1996. Instead, he started two companies, the 21st Century Group, Inc., a government relations firm based in Washington, D.C., and Texana Global, Inc., an international trade corporation headquartered in Texas. He has served on various corporate and charitable boards. In 2004, the U.S. Post Office in Kingwood was renamed the \\"Congressman Jack Fields Post Office\\" in Fields' honor. He joined Insperity as a director in January 1997. His total compensation for this role in 2009 was $120,746. Fields is married to Lynn Fields and has two daughters, Jordan and Lexi, and a stepson, Josh Hughes.

He promised him that he would give Vinayak an opportunity to prove himself. After Paaduthaa Theeyagaa, He was not doing much as an assistant and thus started working on his own scripts. When Suresh offered to make a film with him, he was thrilled and narrated the story to NTR. NTR liked the subject. It was a love story. But Kodali Nani didn't like it. After a couple of days, he narrated another story that was instantly liked and taken to the sets, and that was the story of Aadi. They went to Mumbai to search for a heroine. They considered Aarti Agarwal, but she had just signed on the dotted line for Nuvvu Naaku Nacchaav. They also considered Ayesha Takia, but their cameraman felt that she wasn't the right choice for NTR. Seeing the Fair & Lovely ad, Vinayak felt Trisha would be an ideal choice, but his sister didn't like her. They dropped that idea too with a primary belief that if ladies didn't like much, then it will just not work out. While in Mumbai still, they also met Sada also there, but she'd have been so lean beside NTR, they thought and we dropped her too. During all this, the shooting was already in progress! Thus, we had to find just someone. That's how it all happened. Box office Aadi by collected 190 million rupees (19 crore) share revenue from its theatrical run(with a budget of 3.2 crores).

Brogan edited and published the first few chapters as a fragment with a selection of Ransome's other short stories in 1988. The story starts in the Broads but continues in the Lake District after the Death and Glories hitch a ride aboard a boat being delivered to the Lake in the North. Plot summary The Death and Glories are bored because the salvage business is in decline on the Broads. They see a boat being loaded for delivery to the Lake in the North where the Swallows, Amazons and Ds have their adventures, and Joe (without consulting Bill or Pete) decides that they will go along for the ride to see the Lake. They get left behind at a stop near the Lake, make their way to the lake, and find that the lorry has already left for Norfolk and they have no way to get home. They meet the owner of the boat who takes them to find the Ds. They encounter the Swallows, Amazons and Ds sailing on the lake and make an attempt to rescue Nancy after her boat capsizes. At this point the story as published ends, though notes indicate that Ransome was struggling to develop a suitable plot line and a way of arranging for the Death and Glories to get home without their impoverished parents having to pay the fare. Various scenarios are mentioned, including the salvage of Captain Flint's houseboat when its anchor chain breaks in a squall. In gratitude Captain Flint pays for their return journey and gives them a reward. In 2011 the Arthur Ransome Society's journal Mixed Moss held a competition for the best outline of a plot to complete the book, but (writing in 2014) no author has yet been commissioned by Ransome's estate to do so. Other Stories Coots in the North also includes two extracts that Hugh Brogan rescued from an unfinished Victorian ‘Bevis’-style novel, a fishing tale called \\"The River Comes First\\", plus several short stories that Arthur Ransome published in magazines: :\\"The River Comes First\\" and \\"The Cloudburst\\" :\\"The Unofficial Side\\" is the only story he wrote involving the Russian Revolution.

It is situated 7 km northwest of Tübingen. Geographical location The municipality Ammerbuch is 345–551 meters above sea level in part on the edge of the Schönbuch nature park, and partly in the valley of Ammer in the northern Gäu. Geology Ammerbuch is located in the Gäu, which is dominated by keuper, gypsum and sandstone layers. Since 1750, limestone was mined in Reusten, the last quarry was closed in 1970. In Breitenholz, Entringen, Poltringen and Altingen gypsum was mined, but now only the gypsum quarry in Altingen is in operation. In the northern Schönbuch, but also in Breitenholz sandstone was broken since 1383. Neighboring communities The following cities and towns bordering the municipality Ammerbuch, they are in a clockwise direction starting called the north and part of the district of Tübingen¹ or the Böblingen²: Herrenberg², Altdorf², Tübingen¹, Rottenburg am Neckar¹ and Gäufelden². Municipality arrangement The municipality Ammerbuch consists of the six districts (Teilorte): * Altingen (8.58 km²; 2549 inhabitants in March 2015,Municipality Ammerbuch – Numbers and facts - number of inhabitants * Breitenholz (10.82 km²; 768) * Entringen (13.94 km²; 3700) * Pfäffingen (3, 70 km²; 1811) * Poltringen (4.84 km²; 1742) * Reusten (6.11 km²; 973). Castle Ammerbuch-Pfäffingen Except for the districts Entringen and Pfäffingen, the districts are villages (Ortschaften) according to the municipal code of Baden- Württemberg, which each have a local council and a mayor as its chairman.Hauptsatzung der Gemeinde Ammerbuch vom 11. Dezember 2001, last change on 26 July 2004 (PDF; 41 kB) retrieved on 21 March 2009 The castle Hohenentringen belongs to the district Entringen. Climate Ammerbuch is dominated by pleasantly mild climate, in some places part-time winemakers grow grapes. Ammerbuch is located near the earthquake zone of the Hohenzollerngraben (Hohenzollern-trench). History The oldest evidence of a settlement in the Ammer Valley goes back to the Neolithic period. Tools, huts and tombs have been found on the Kirchberg in Reusten, and their age is estimated to be about 6,000 years. In Pfäffingen, Entringen and Poltringen there are foundations of Roman estates. A Roman road, which was later known as King Street or Ammer Valley road, led from Sumelocenna (today Rottenburg am Neckar) via Unterjesingen, Poltringen, Reusten and Altingen to Herrenberg and continued to Portus (today Pforzheim). From 84–260 after Christ the Ammer Valley was dominated by the Romans before they were ousted by the Alemanni. In the 3rd century, Alemanni originating from northern Germany settled in the Ammertal and on the Schönbuch slopes. Probably in the 5th or 6th century the six villages arose that now form Ammerbuch. The County Palatine of Tübingen sold their possession in 1293 to the Bebenhausen monastery. Their seat was the Roseck Castle, above Unterjesingen at the edge of the Schönbuch. After the dissolution of the monastery Bebenhausen 1534/35 the villages came for the most part to the Duchy of Württemberg and became Protestant. In 1699 Pfäffingen came to Württemberg, the half of Altingen, two-thirds of Poltringen and part of Reusten came in Austrian possession and were partly Catholic as part of Further Austria. 1806 Napoleon I. rewarded Württemberg for his allegiance. The further Austrian parts around Rottenburg fell to Württemberg. The villages were administered since 1808 by the Oberamt Herrenberg. In the reorganization by the Nazis in 1938, they fell to the district of Tübingen. Ammerbuch was founded on 1 December 1971 in the context of the local government reform by the merger of the municipalities Altingen, Breitenholz, Entringen, Pfäffingen, Poltringen and Reusten. Name The name Ammerbuch has not grown historically. It is an artificial word that refers to the scenic location between Ammer Valley and Schönbuch.

From this the provincial road 359 branches off in Pfäffingen, which passes through Pfäffingen, Poltringen, Reusten and Altingen. The Ammer Valley Railway runs from Tübingen to Herrenberg through the municipality with breakpoints in Pfäffingen, Entringen and Altingen. In Herrenberg it provides connections to the Gäu Railway from Stuttgart to Hattingen. In Tübingen it provides connections to Reutlingen, Metzingen and Nürtingen, Wendlingen and Stuttgart or to Rottenburg and Hechingen). The Ammertalbahn drove 1910 for the first time. In 1966, it was shut down. In 1999 the operation was resumed. The Public transport is guaranteed by the transport association naldo (Vehrsverbund Neckar-Alb-Donau). The community is located in the comb 110. The district Altingen is on the comb boundary 110/501, the district Pfäffingen on the comb boundary 110/111. North of Poltringen is the air field of the Air Sports Association Ammerbuch. =Media= The press landscape Ammerbuch is mainly characterized by two daily newspapers. The Schwäbisches Tagblatt comes from Tübingen and is the most common daily newspaper. The Gäubote from Herrenberg is the second sheet in place. The official journal of the municipality is Ammerbuch Aktuell, which appears weekly on Thursday. =Education= Ammerbuch has in each of the six districts a primary school. In addition, a community school is in Altingen. More schools can be found in Herrenberg, Rottenburg and Tübingen.

Hasluck, Christianity and Islam under the Sultans (Oxford) 1929. The landscape itself was Christianized, as prominent features were rededicated to Christian saints, sometimes quite directly, as when the island of Oglasa in the Tyrrhenian Sea was christened Montecristo. Early Christianity In the first centuries of Christianity churches were either house churches in whatever houses were offered for use by their owners, or were shrines on the burial-sites of martyrs or saints, which following the usual classical practice were invariably on the (then) edges of cities - the necropolis was always outside the polis. In Rome the early basilica churches of St. Peter's, Saint Paul Outside the Walls and San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, all follow this pattern. This distinction was gradually broken down, perhaps earliest in Roman Africa, as relics of the saints came to be kept in city-centre churches. By the 6th century bishops were often buried inside their cathedral, and other Christians followed.Williams, 56-59 Given the plethora of worship locations for various cults, many had fallen into disuse well before the rise of Christianity. The establishment of a third century Roman military camp in the temple complex at Luxor demonstrates an ongoing process of adaptive re-use. Obsolete temples often had their stone elements repurposed for use in new construction. Many ancient accounts of the manner of conversion of non- Christian places of worship into churches are not borne out by subsequent on- site archaeology.Emmel, Stephen, Gotter, Ulrich, and Hahn, Johannes. \\"Analyzing a Late Antique Phenomenon of Transformation\\", From Temple to Church, BRILL, 2008 After the Peace of the Church, the old pagan temples continued to function but gradually fell into disuse, and were finally all closed by the decrees of Theodosius I at the end of the 4th century. Initially they were shunned by Christians, perhaps because of their pagan associations, but also because their shape did not suit Christian requirements: \\"To the early Church, only one sort of building seemed suitable for christianization: the basilica\\", which had previously always been a secular type of building. Ancient Rome and Greece =Rome= In Rome itself, numerous buildings including pagan temples and other sites were converted into churches, and several major archeological sites owe their preservation to this. On the Roman Forum alone, the Curia Iulia or Roman Senate building (Sant'Adriano in Foro), the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina (San Lorenzo in Miranda), and the Temple of Romulus (Santi Cosma e Damiano) were transformed into churches, and the churches of San Giuseppe dei Falegnami and San Pietro in Carcere were built above the Mamertine Prison nearby, where Sts. Peter and Paul were reputed to have been held. \\"Santa Maria Rotonda\\" (Pantheon) The Pantheon in Rome was once a temple dedicated to the Roman gods and it was converted to a Roman Catholic church dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs. Eventually the prime sites of the pagan temples were very often occupied for churches, the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva (literally Saint Mary above Minerva) in Rome, Christianized about 750, being simply the most obvious example. The Basilica of Junius Bassus was made a church in the late fifth century. However this process did not really begin in Rome itself until the 6th and 7th centuries, and was still under way during the Renaissance, when the Pantheon was made a church and Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri and San Bernardo alle Terme made from parts of the enormous Baths of Diocletian. One of the most richly adorned churches, the Basilica di San Clemente, was, according to Christian tradition, built on top of Titus Flavius Clemens's private home, as he had allowed early Christians to worship in his home, due to having pro-Jewish sympathies. The conversion of pre-Christian places of worship, rather than their destruction, was particularly true of temples of Mithras, a religion that had been the main rival to Christianity during the 2nd and 3rd centuries, especially among the Roman legions. An early 2nd century Mithraeum stands across the Roman street from the house and can be visited by visitors. Other Mithraea have been excavated under churches, such as Santa Prisca, and Santo Stefano Rotondo. Several churches, especially in Rome, are said to have been built on the sites of the earlier burial places of martyrs in the catacombs of Rome or elsewhere. The sanctification of burial places, and placing tombs inside churches, was a novelty of Christianity, and a break with pagan tradition, where burials were regarded as unclean, and usually only allowed beyond a set distance from a city's walls. =Vatican= St. Peter's Basilica, the church of the Vatican, is traditionally located at the burial place of Simon Peter, and most scholars parties agree that the basilica was built on top of a large necropolis on the Vatican Hill. In 1939, an excavation underneath the grottoes which lie directly under the current Basilica, uncovered several surviving Roman mausoleums from the necropolis, and in the area directly under the high altar, below the grottoes, the excavators found a structure resembling a temple that they named the aedicula (meaning little temple). =Greece= In Greece, the occupation of pagan sites by Christian monasteries and churches was ubiquitous.Gregory, T. \\"the survival of paganism in Christian Greece\\", American Journal of Philology 107 (1986:229-42). Hellenic Aphrodisias in Caria was renamed Stauropolis, the \\"City of the Cross\\".See R.S. Cormack, \\"The temple as the cathedral\\" in C. Roueché and K.T. Erim. eds. Aphrodisias Papers: Recent Work on Architecture and Sculpture, Journal of Roman Archaeology supplement (Ann Arbor 1990:75-88). Allison Franz argues that it was only after temples ceased to be regarded as serious cult sites that they were later converted to churches. \\"So it was by virtue of necessity rather than in token of a victorious faith that the temples of the old dispensation became the province of the new.\\"Rothaus, Richard M., Corinth, the First City of Greece, p.33, n.6, BRILL, 2000 Exceptions to this are the conversion of the Askepieion in Athens around 529, and both the Hephaisteion and Athena's temple at the Parthenon, during the seventh century, reflecting possible conflict between Christians and non-Christians. In Byzantine times, the Parthenon became the Church of the Parthenos Maria (Virgin Mary), or the Church of the Theotokos (Mother of God). It was the fourth most important pilgrimage in the Eastern Roman Empire after Constantinople, Ephessos and Thessalonica.Anthony Kaldellis Associate Professor (Department of Greek and Latin, The Ohio State University), A Heretical (Orthodox) History of the Parthenon , p.3 Middle Ages Cassiodorus, the court secretary to the Ostrogoth Theodoric the Great, described in a letter written in A.D. 527, a fair held at a former pagan shrine of Leucothea, in the still culturally Greek region of south Italy, which had been Christianized by converting it to a baptistery (Variae 8.33). Sulpicius Severus, in his Vita of Martin of Tours, wrote, \\"wherever he destroyed heathen temples, there he used immediately to build either churches or monasteries\\", and when Benedict of Nursia took possession of the site at Monte Cassino, he began by smashing the sculpture of Apollo and the altar that crowned the height. Montmartre (originally Mons Martis, \\"Mount of Mars\\", later re-interpreted as Mons martyris, \\"Mountain of the martyr\\") was the site of one of the oldest surviving Christian churches in France - Saint Pierre was earlier a mercurii monte - a high place dedicated to Lugus, a major Celtic deity (and one that the Romans viewed as a homology of Mercury). In Francia, the site chosen for the abbey of Luxueil were the ruins of a well-fortified Gallo-Roman settlement, Luxovium, that had been ravaged by Attila in 451, and was now buried in the dense overgrown woodland that had filled the abandoned site over more than a century; the place still had the advantage of the thermal baths (\\"constructed with unusual skill\\", according to Columbanus' early biographer, Jonas of Bobbio) down in the valley, which still give the town its name of Luxeuil-les-Bains. Jonas described it further: \\"There stone images crowded the nearby woods, which were honoured in the miserable cult and profane former rites in the time of the pagans\\".The Life of St. Columban, by the Monk Jonas, Medieval Sourcebook With a grant from an officer of the palace at Childebert's court, an abbey church was built within the heathen site and its \\"spectral haunts\\". The Encierro The Notre-Dame du Taur (Our Lady of the Bull), cathedral church of Toulouse, which is famous for the Encierro festival of running bulls, is thought by archaeologists to possibly be a converted temple of Mithras, whose myth focused on the tauroctony, the killing of a sacred bull. Among the country people (pagani) as Jean Seznec observed that euhemerist dismissal by Christian writers of pagan deities as once having been human was insufficient cause to abandon old ways: \\"in country districts, the chief obstacle to Christianity was offered by the tenacious survival of anthropomorphic cults; here the problem became one of still further humanizing the divinities of springs, trees and mountains, in order to rob them of their prestige\\".Seznec, The Survival of the Pagan Gods, (B.F. Sessions, tr.) 1995:13 note 8. Samuel J. Barish found further examples of the transition from miraculous springs to baptisteries from Gregory of Tours (died c. 594) and Maximus, Bishop of Turin (died c. 466). =Britain and Northern Europe= Neolithic Tumulus topped by a Catholic church in Carnac. In Britain, the legendary King Lucius, was reported by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the often unreliable Christian chronicler, to have deliberately converted all the old temples to churches. The historical actuality is nowhere more forthrightly discussed than in the famous letter from Pope Gregory I to Mellitus, about to join Augustine of Kent among the Anglo-Saxons: Several Roman pagan sites in Britain may have been converted to Christian use in the 4th Century, such as the Temple of Claudius in Roman Colchester and two of the seven Romano-Celtic Temples in the town, all of which underwent restructuring in the 300s AD and around which have been found early Christian symbols such as the Chi Rho.Crummy, Nina; Crummy, Philip; and Crossan, Carl (1993) Colchester Archaeological Report 9: Excavations of Roman and later cemeteries, churches and monastic sites in Colchester, 1971-88. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust ()Faulkner, Neil. (1994) Late Roman Colchester, In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 13(1) A menhir in Brittany has been topped with a cross The British Isles and other areas of northern Europe that were formerly druidic are still densely punctuated by holy wells and holy springs that are now attributed to some local saint. An example of the pre-Christian water spirit is the melusina. In Britain and many other parts of Europe trees were also sometimes seen as sacred or the home of tree spirits. When Britain was Christianized this resulted in a change of the landscape. In some instances sacred groves were destroyed to discourage belief in tree spirits. One of the most famous of these was the Irminsul, whose ancient location is no longer known (though it may have been located at Externsteine), was obliterated by Charlemagne. Another major ancient holy tree was Thor's Oak, which was deliberately desecrated and destroyed by a Christian missionary named Winfrid (later canonised as Saint Boniface). In Britain and the Celtic northwest of Europe, the divinities of springs were transformed into local saints who were often venerated only at the location of their \\"holy well\\". =Iberian Peninsula= Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba, Built over a pagan worship place, then converted into church and then, the Umayyad Moors built a mosque half of the site, which was then turned into a Christian cathedral Sometime toward the end of the fifth century, an abandoned \\"mithraeum\\" near present-day Motaro, was rebuilt as a church.Kulikowski, Michael. \\"Late Roman Spain and Its Cities\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010 During the Spanish Reconquista Christian populations were often brought to an area with the goal of establishing a Christian base, one that would be loyal to the Crown of Castile and whose culture would supplant that of the subjugated Moorish peoples; for example Murcia. During the process of Christianization, many of the conquered city’s mosques were destroyed or converted into Catholic churches, typically the great Friday mosques were converted,Monks and nuns, saints and outcasts, religion in medieval society: essays in honor of Lester K. Little, Lester K. Little, Sharon A. Farmer, Barbara H. Rosenwein, page 190, 2000 such as the Great Mosque of Cordoba converted into a cathedral in 1236. shrine of Saint James at Compostela Santiago de Compostela is a major site of Christian pilgrimage, and said in Christian tradition to originate as the burial place of Saint James the Great; pilgrims traditionally follow the Way of St. James until they reach the Cathedral, but then, having visited the church, continue to Cape Finisterre. The continuation to Cape Finisterre is regarded by historians as unjustifiable for Christian reasons, but Finisterre has a prominent pre-Christian significance, it was considered to literally be the edge of the world (hence the name finisterre, meaning end of the world), due to it seeming to be the westernmost point of Europe (in reality, even though it juts out to the west, the more subtle Cabo da Roca holds the honour). In pre-Christian times, the souls of the dead were believed to trace their way across all Europe to Finisterre and follow the sun across the sea, and their route, the Santa Compaña, became a significant pilgrimage throughout south western Europe. Santiago de Compostela itself was held to be the place where the dead gathered together, and where their paths finally all joined together for the final stretch of the journey; one possible etymology of Compostela is burial ground, suggesting that even the name derives from the pre-Christian belief. During the Reconquista and the Crusades, the cross served the symbolic function of physical possession that a flag would occupy today. At the siege of Lisbon in 1147, when a mixed group of Christians took the city, \\"What great joy and what a great abundance there was of pious tears when, to the praise and honor of God and of the most Holy Virgin Mary the saving cross was placed atop the highest tower to be seen by all as a symbol of the city's subjection.\\"De expugnatione Lyxbonensi (On-line text) Nuestra Señora de los Remedios doesn't efface the Great Pyramid of Cholula, Mexico. New World The Spanish in the New World converted many Native American temples into churches, following their procedure in Spain against Muslim mosques. The Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral was built on an Aztec temple. Few Native American sites in North America could compare with the pyramid temples of Mexico and Central America. Often the Christianized site in Spanish America gives no indication of its former use, as at the site of a pyramid shrine to the god Huitzilopochtli that was dismantled to provide stone for the Franciscan monastery that now houses the Museo Nacional de las Intervenciones. Balkans During the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 15th century, many churches were converted into mosques with a minaret added, in the 19th century many former church-mosques were re-converted into churches and their minarets destroyed, such as the Church of Prophet Elijah (Thessaloniki). After the Christian Balkan states obtained independence from the Muslim Ottoman Empire, they destroyed Ottoman mosques. In many cases the minarets of the mosques were destroyed while the mosque itself was converted into a church or left to decay. The Sveti Sedmochislenitsi Church in Sofia was a 15th-century abandoned Ottoman mosque, converted into a church in the 19th century. In Croatia the only three remaining mosques from the Ottoman period, those in Đakovo, Klis and Drniš, have been converted or re-converted into Catholic churches. Vietnam In Vietnam, after the French invasion, many Buddhist and Taoist temples were neglected by the colonial government, notably the Bao Thien temple in Hanoi were razed to make way for the St. Joseph Cathedral. The Tra Kieu church in Quang Nam was built in the 18th century on the site of a hilltop Hindu temple in Sinhapura, ancient capital of the Champa kingdom, and became an important Christian pilgrimage site ever since.

He was professor and head of the School of Earth Sciences at James Cook University in Australia from 1981 to 1998, and was prominent in promoting climate change denial.  Early life and education  Carter was born in Reading, England on 9 March 1942 and emigrated to New Zealand in 1956, where he attended Lindisfarne College. He obtained a B.Sc. (Hons) in geology from the University of Otago in 1963 and returned to England to complete a Ph.D. in paleontology from the University of Cambridge in 1968. His doctoral thesis was titled The Functional Morphology of Bivalved Mollusca.  Career  Carter began his career as an assistant lecturer in geology at the University of Otago in 1963 and advanced to senior lecturer after obtaining his Ph.D. in 1968. He was professor and head of the School of Earth Sciences at James Cook University from 1981 to 1998, an adjunct research professor at the Marine Geophysical Laboratory at James Cook University from 1998 to 2005 and a visiting research professor in geology and geophysics at the University of Adelaide from 2001 to 2005. He published papers on taxonomic palaeontology, palaeoecology, the growth and form of the molluscan shell, New Zealand and Pacific geology, stratigraphic classification, sequence stratigraphy, sedimentology, the Great Barrier Reef, Quaternary geology, and sea-level and climate change. Carter published primary research in the field of palaeoclimatology, investigating New Zealand's climate extending back to 3.9 Ma. Carter retired from James Cook University in 2002, maintaining the status of \\"adjunct professor\\" until January 2013, when Carter's position of adjunct professor was not renewed. He maintained an association with several think tanks that disagree with some aspects of the scientific consensus on climate change. He was a founding member of the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition, an emeritus fellow and science policy advisor at the Institute of Public Affairs, a science advisor at the Science and Public Policy Institute, and the chief science advisor for the International Climate Science Coalition (ICSC). He served as chair of the Earth Sciences Discipline Panel of the Australian Research Council, director of the Australian Office of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), and Co-Chief Scientist on ODP Leg 181 (Southwest Pacific Gateway). Carter was a member of the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of America, the Geological Society of Australia, the Geological Society of New Zealand and the Society for Sedimentary Geology. Robert Carter died on 19 January 2016 after a heart attack at the age of 73.  Views on global warming  Carter was critical of the IPCC and believed statements about dangerous human-caused global warming to be unjustified. He was on the research committee of the Institute of Public Affairs, an Australian free-market think tank which promotes climate change denial, and connected with its subsidiary think-tanks. In April 2006, he argued against climate change being \\"man-made\\" by asserting that the global average temperature \\"had stopped\\" for the eight years since 1998, while the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased. Chris Mooney refers to this article as an early example of statistically misleading use of the short period from the exceptionally strong El Niño year of 1998 which had set a temperature record. In 2007, Carter participated in an expert panel discussion after the airing of The Great Global Warming Swindle documentary on ABC. His position on global warming was criticized by other scientists such as David Karoly, James Renwick and Ove Hoegh-Guldberg. In 2007, Wendy Frew, an environmental reporter with The Sydney Morning Herald, stated Carter \\"appears to have little standing in the Australian climate science community.\\" He published several critiques of global warming in economics journals. In 2009, he co-authored a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, which argued that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation accounted for most of the global temperature variation of the last fifty years. A rebuttal by nine other scientists was published in the same issue. Carter appeared as a witness before the 2009 select committee on climate policy of the Parliament of Australia, and testified before the United States Senate on the issue of human-caused climate change. He appeared in the media speaking for the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), a contrarian report backed by The Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank opposed to climate change responses. He was a contributor and reviewer of their 2009 report Climate Change Reconsidered, and lead author of the 2011 interim report. In 2012, documents acquired from The Heartland Institute think tank revealed that Carter was paid a monthly fee of US$1,667 \\"as part of a program to pay 'high-profile individuals who regularly and publicly counter the alarmist [anthropogenic global warming] message'.\\" While Carter did not deny that the payments took place, he declined to discuss the payments. Carter emphatically denied that his scientific opinion on climate change could be bought.  Awards and honors  * 1975 - Hochstetter Lecturer, Geological Society of New Zealand * 1992 - Allan P.

The Faculty of Economics at the Széchenyi István University holds his name.  Education  Born in Győr, he started his University studies at the Royal Academy of Philosophy at Győr. After two academic years, he moved to Pest to study at the University of Pest, where he earned his doctorate in law in 1850. He then went on to study abroad for a year, visiting universities of Berlin, Heidelberg and Leipzig. He was influenced by the English classical school of Economics, and also by Wilhelm Roscher, then a professor at Leipzig, a representative of the German historian school.  Academia  He started his academic career in 1851, with an assistant lecturer position at the Royal Academy of Justice at Pozsony. He moved to work as a regular teacher at the Royal Academy of Justice at Nagyvárad in 1853. His subject was the Austrian financial law, then political economics. In 1858 he moved back to Pest to become a teacher of public law and public administration at the Technical University of Pest. He was teaching at the University of Pest from 1863 onwards. He became the associate of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1862, and he received regular membership in 1865. He was elected the dean of the Faculty of Justice and Administration at University of Pest for the 1872/1873 term, and he was the rector of the University of Pest in the 1973/1974. From 1902 he was the chairman of the Hungarian Economic Association for 6 years. He held the position of the vice- chairman of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from 1904 to 1907. He was the member of the Société d'Economie Politique in Paris and the Royal Statistical Society of London.  Political career  Kautz held liberal views. He was the member of the Deák Party, and he belonged to the inner circle around Ferenc Deák. He was one of the key figures who prepared and developed the economic programme behind the Ausgleich. In 1865 he won Győr's seat in the Parliament, and he held this position for three consecutive terms, from 1865 to 1883. He was elected the permanent member of the Upper Chamber in 1885.  Financial career  In 1883 he was named the Hungarian vice-governor of the Austro- Hungarian Bank, then the central bank of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. He was chosen to be the governor of the Austro-Hungarian Bank in 1892. He led the transition to the new currency, the Austro-Hungarian krone. He left his position at the Austro-Hungarian Bank in 1900, when the monetary reform was completed.

Built in about 1290 by John Fortin, a prosperous merchant, the house survived many centuries of domestic and commercial use largely intact. German bomb damage in 1940 revealed the medieval interior of the house, and in the 1980s it was restored to resemble its initial appearance and placed in the care of English Heritage, to be run as a tourist attraction. The house is built to a medieval right-angle, narrow plan design, with an undercroft to store wine at a constant temperature, and a first-storey bedchamber that projects out into the street to add additional space. The building is architecturally significant because, as historian Glyn Coppack highlights, it is \\"the only building of its type to survive substantially as first built\\"; it is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.Coppack, p.5. History =13th to 15th centuries= The Medieval Merchant's House was built in about 1290 on French Street, Southampton,Coppack, p.16. then a major port and a large provincial town with a population of around 5,000, grown rich from the trade with England's continental possessions in Europe.Dyer, p.190. The area of Southampton around French Street had been re-planned earlier in the century, reducing the numbers of farm animals kept in and around the houses, driving poorer merchants and craftsmen into the less desirable northern half of the city, and creating a quarter of large, impressive houses, often built in stone with tiled roofs.Platt, p.30. The original house was designed for use by John Fortin, a prosperous wine merchant, with a vaulted cellar for holding stock, a shop at the front of the property and accommodation for the family; much of it was built in stone, but it featured a timber front, a fashionable design for the period.Coppack, p.4, 18. At least 60 other houses similar to the Medieval Merchant's House were built in Southampton at around the same time. The central hall By the 1330s, Southampton's prosperity was in a slow decline. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged.Platt, p.98; Ottaway, p.171; Southampton HER MSH23, Heritage Gateway, accessed 20 January 2011. The house may have been one of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western corner of the building collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed in the aftermath of the attacks and never fully recovered.Coppack, pp.19–20. The character of French Street began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings.Coppack, p.20. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendant of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built. During the 15th century the economy of Southampton improved as a result of the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants.Coppack, p.22. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, unlike many other properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined, taking with it the prosperity of French Street. A new parlour was installed in the house, and a floor was added halfway across the open hall to produce additional sleeping space. =16th to 20th centuries= The house was transformed into three cottages during the 17th century, which involved a new door and additional fireplaces being added. The economy and status of Southampton did not begin to improve until the 18th century, when it became a noted cultural centre.The borough of Southampton: General historical account, A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 3, Institute of Historical Research, 1908, accessed 4 June 2011. In 1780 the three cottages were converted back into a single building, owned by a Mrs Collins as a lodging house for actors. During the Victorian era Southampton saw a huge expansion of its maritime docks and the construction of a new railway line. The Medieval Merchant's House was converted again, and had become a beer-shop by 1883, and a popular public house called the Bull's Head. =Late 20th and 21st centuries= The east bedchamber When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the house was being used as a brothel. In 1940 Southampton was heavily targeted during the Blitz. German bombs seriously damaged the house, revealing its medieval interior,Coppack, pp.16, 23. and as a result Southampton City Council bought the property. In 1972 it was passed to the Secretary of State for the Environment, before being placed into the care of English Heritage in 1984. The decision was taken to restore the Medieval Merchant's House as a tourist attraction, and the necessary work was carried out between 1983 and 1985. Academic Raphael Samuel has noted that the restoration was heavily influenced by the late-20th-century tradition of living history, in which \\"reinterpretation\\" gives way to \\"retrofitting\\".Samuel, p.195. The process was also constrained by the damage that had occurred to the post-medieval parts of the building during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Following archaeological investigations, the house was restored as closely as possible to its medieval condition, removing later material. Where the original medieval parts of the house had been lost, the work was based on archaeological reinterpretation.Coppack, p.23. The finished house was fitted with replica late-13th-century and 14th-century furniture, and the uniform for the English Heritage staff running the house was originally medieval in design. The Medieval Merchant's House on 58 French Street remains a tourist attraction and is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.Medieval Merchant's House, National Monuments Record, English Heritage, accessed 4 June 2011; Southampton City Council – Historic Environment Record: Listed Buildings in Southampton, p.73, Southampton City Council, accessed 4 June 2011. Architecture The undercroft, designed to store wine The Medieval Merchant's House today faces onto French Street and combines walls built of Bembridge and Purbeck stone with a timber frontage.Coppack, pp.4–5. The layout of the house follows a medieval right-angle, narrow plan design, in that the hall stretches away from the street to conserve frontage, and there is no internal courtyard built into the design.Pantin, pp.204–5. Architecturally the house is important because, as historian Glyn Coppack highlights, it is \\"the only building of its type to survive substantially as first built\\". At the front of the house, on the ground floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have conducted his mercantile business.Coppack, p.6. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork.Coppack, pp.7–8. A hallway runs along one side of the hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively.Emery, p.158; Coppack, p.9. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling.Coppack, p.10. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however.Coppack, p.15. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.Emery, p.156. On the first floor the house is split into east and west bedchambers, linked across the central hall by a gallery.Coppack pp.9, 12. The east bedchamber is at the front of the house, and projects out into the street—this was a feature used to add space to houses, and is also seen in properties in Shrewsbury, Tewkesbury and York.Emery, p.158. Some of the makers' marks of the original builders can still be seen on the timbers in the room.Coppack, p.12. The west bedchamber more closely resembles its 19th- century appearance rather than the medieval, as the Victorian-era ceiling has been left in place.Coppack, p.14. The roof of the house is an identical replacement for the medieval original, tiled with Cornish slate.Coppack, pp.15, 24.

The mosque was built in 1630, and named after the Mughal governor of Peshawar, Nawab Mahabat Khan bin Ali Mardan Khan, known alternatively as Mahabat Khan and Ali Mardan Khan. The mosque's white marble façade is considered to be one of Peshawar's most iconic sights. History The mosque was built between 1660 and 1670, on what was the highest point in the old city. The minarets of the Mohabbat Khan Mosque were frequently used in Sikh times for hanging prisoners. Five people per day were hanged from the minaretes, \`as a substitute for the gallows’. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, refugee tribal elders would congregate in the mosque in order to forge unity amongst Afghans against the Soviets. Layout The mosque is 30,155 square feet in size. Its open courtyard has a centrally-located ablution pool and a single row of rooms lining the exterior walls. Architecture The mosque's ceiling is embellished with elegant red frescoes in geometrics and floral motifs. The mosque’s exterior was finished in white marble. The mosque's interior is decorated with Mughal frescoes. The prayer hall occupies the west side. The hall is flanked by two tall minarets, which are divided into three sections. The façade of the prayer hall is also capped by 6 smaller decorative minarets that flank the mosque's 5 arched entryways, with an additional 2 minarets flanking the set of 6. The prayer hall is capped by 3 fluted domes. The roofline rises from the outer edges, towards the centre by a series of four small incremental height increases. The roofline is embellished with numerous merlons. The top of the mosque's white marble façade is capped by cavettos, or concave moulding. 5 arched portals offer entry into the main prayer hall. The central arch is the tallest, and features cusped arches typical of the Mughal style. The central arch is flanked by two slightly shorter un-cusped arches, that are designed in the Persian and Central Asian style. These arches are flanked by a smaller arch decorated in a similar style, and row of 7 small arched portals are found above the tip of each arch. The three central arched portals are embellished with muqarnas above the row of 7 mini-arched portals, while the outermost arches are instead decorated with ghalib kari, or a network of ribs made of stucco and plaster that are applied to curved surfaces in the archways for decorative purposes. Archways into the mosque are also flanked by vegetal motifs along their upper curves, which unlike the green motifs at Badshahi Mosque, are multi-coloured. Both the interior and exterior feature panels embellished with floral motifs and Quranic calligraphy. The interior of the prayer hall is sheltered beneath the three low fluted domes and is eloquently painted with floral and geometric designs. minar-e-masjid mahabat khan Gallery File:MohabbatKhanMosque.png File:PeshawarMahabatKhanM.jpgThe minarets of the mosque feature cupolas and overhanging eaves File:Flickr - boellstiftung - Altstadt Peshawar.jpgPeshawar's Jeweler's Bazaar is located next to the mosque.

Glencairn House is the official residence of the British Ambassador to Ireland. Glencairn has been the official residence of successive British Ambassadors to Ireland since the 1950s. The house is located in the southern suburbs of Dublin, on the Murphystown Road in the Leopardstown area, adjacent to exit 14 of the M50 motorway. History At the beginning of the 20th century, the house was owned by Richard Croker, a leading figure from New York's Tammany Hall. The house and its surrounding estate were sold by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in April 1999 for GBP£24 million, without having purchased an alternative residence. In 2000, an alternative site was purchased at nearby Marlay Grange, close to Marlay Park.Marlay Grange The Ambassador continued to live at Glencairn while the Marlay Grange site was refurbished. A subsequent cost appraisal showed that it would in fact be more cost effective to repurchase Glencairn than to continue with plans to refurbish Marlay Grange, and in 2007 the British Government sold Marlay Grange, without ever having occupied it.Fiona Tyrrell, British selling house ambassador never moved into, The Irish Times, 27 September 2007Marlay Grange sale particulars , Colliers Jackson-Stops, October 2007. Retrieved 2008-06-23. Prior to Richard Croker's ownership, Glencairn was in the Gresson family. It was the home of the Reverend George Leslie Gresson, born in 1767 in Ireland. George Leslie Gresson and his wife Clarissa Reynell, whom he married in 1798, had ten children: William Reynell 1799, George 1800, Chapman 1801, Harriette 1804, Henry Barnes Gresson 1809, Clarissa 1811, Richard 1813, Robert Christmas 1817, Eleanor 1819, and finally Skelton. In 1826, George Leslie Gresson married Mary Anne Turpin and they had five children: Charles, John, Henrietta Elizabeth, Mary Ann, and Alicia in 1835. Luas halt The sale of the land facilitated the acquiring of a railway corridor for an extension of the Luas Sandyford (Green) line to Cherrywood.

Christianization of saints Historian Peter Brown, in his The Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity, argued that one cannot equate the ancient cults of pagan gods with the later cults of the saints.Brown, Peter. The Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity,(1981), However, Caesarius of Arles and other churchmen deplored certain customs that from time to time seem to develop around the saints, such as the prolonged drinking of toasts, ostensibly in honor of the saint.Filotas, Bernadette. Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature, PIMS, 2005 The historicity of some Christian saints has been treated skeptically by a number of academics, either because there is a paucity of historical evidence for their origins, or due to resemblances to pre-Christian deities and festivals. Some such local saints, especially those dating to when regions were being Christianized have been removed from the Calendar of Saints and effectively desanctified by the Catholic Church after investigations led to doubts about their historicity. Others, such as Brigid of Kildare, have had doubts raised about their historicity, but retain their position in part due to their historical importance. The legend of Barlaam and Josaphat was derived, via Arabic and Georgian versions, from the life story of Siddartha Gautama, known as the Buddha. The king-turned-monk Joasaphat (Arabic Yūdhasaf or Būdhasaf; Georgian Iodasaph) also gets his name from the Sanskrit Bodhisattva, the term traditionally used to refer to Gautama before his awakening. Barlaam and Ioasaph were placed in the Orthodox calendar of saints on 26 August, and in the Roman martyrology they were canonized (as \\"Barlaam and Josaphat\\") and assigned 27 November. The story was translated into Hebrew in the Middle Ages as Ben-HaMelekh ve HaNazir (\\"The King's Son and the Nazirite\\"). Thus the Buddhist story was turned into a Christian and Jewish legend.Joseph Jacobs (ed. and inducer), Barlaam and Josaphat. English Lives of Buddha (David Nutt, London, 1896) xvi-xvii Theories of the Christianization of feasts =St. Valentine's Day= Saint Valentine's Day on 14 February, commemorates three separate martyrs named Valentinus. One is described as a priest at Rome, another as bishop of Interamna (modern Terni). Both apparently died sometime in the second half of the third century and were buried at different locations on the Flaminian Way. The connection of the saints' feast day with popular romantic customs arose in the Middle Ages, when it was commonly believed that half way through the second month of the year, the birds began to pair. Thurston, Herbert. \\"St. Valentine.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 18 Jan. 2015 Alfred Kellogg and Robert Cox, have claimed that the modern customs of Saint Valentine's Day originate from the Roman Lupercalia customs.Henry Ansgar Kelly, in \\"Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine\\" (Leiden: Brill) 1986, pp. 58-63 But J. Hillis Miller and others find the hypothesis unconvincing: they say there is no proof that the modern customs of Saint Valentine's Day can be traced to the Lupercalia, and the claim seems to originate from misconceptions about the festivities. Jack Oruch says there is no written record of Gelasius ever intending a replacement of Lupercalia.Jack B. Oruch, \\"St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February\\" Speculum, 56.3 (July 1981:534–565) =Easter= Christians generally regard Easter as the most important festival of the ecclesiastical calendar. It is also the oldest feast of Christianity, and connected to the Jewish Passover. Many terms relating to Easter, such as paschal are derived from the Hebrew term for passover. In many non-English speaking countries the feast is called by some derivation of \\"pasch\\". The English term, according to the Venerable Bede, is an Anglo-Saxon form relating to Ēostre, a Teutonic goddess of the rising light of day and spring.Holweck, Frederick. \\"Easter.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 18 Jan. 2015 =St. Mark's Day= According to Hippolyte Delehaye, the Greater Litanies of the Feast of St. Mark (April 25) are a continuation and adaptation of the Roman agricultural festival, Robigalia. Delehaye, Hippolyte. The Legends of the Saints, Longmans, Green, and Company, 1907 =All Hallows= \\"Hallowtide\\", refers to the three days of Halloween, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day that are traditionally observed in Western Christianity from October 31 through November 2 as a commemoration of the dead. In many early cultures, the day was considered to start at dusk. Similarly, in Celtic countries the year was considered to begin in winter at Samhain, and it was thought that the start of the year was a time when the world of the dead met that of the living; rather than a sinister event, this was considered a time when a feast should be laid on for the supposed temporary visit from the souls of the dead. The Orthodox tradition, deals rather with the zealous prayer for the dead, whom they believe are allowed to visit the living during 40 days after the moment of death, and always are greatly comforted and even saved from hell, through these prayers. In some Catholic traditions, the night is one when the graves of dead relatives are visited, with candles being lit, under a familiarly atmosphere, often including picnic; many historians argue that this is clearly derived from the pre-Christian events. The Christian festival was originally held annually on the week after Pentecost, and is still held at about this date by the Orthodox churches, but in western Europe, churches began to hold it at the same time as the pre-Christian festivals commemorating the dead, and it was eventually moved officially, by Pope Gregory III. The process was repeated in Southern Mexico, where the Aztec feast of Mictecacihuatl in early August was syncretized into the Day of the Dead. =Christmas= Christmas on 25 December is, according to Christian tradition, a celebration of the birth of Jesus, determined around 350 A.D. by Pope Julius I. Although there have been various folk suggestions regarding the origin of Christmas, the earliest historical source stating December 25 as the date of birth of Jesus was Hippolytus of Rome (170-236), written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox which he placed on March 25, and then added nine months. There is historical evidence that by the middle of the 4th century the Christian churches of the East celebrated the birth and Baptism of Jesus on the same day, on January 6 while those in the West celebrated a Nativity feast on December 25 (perhaps influenced by the Winter solstice); and that by the last quarter of the 4th century, the calendars of both churches included both feasts.Aspects of the liturgical year in Cappadocia (325-430) by Jill Burnett Comings 2005 pp. 61–71 See also * Allhallowtide * Christianized sites Notes References *Kerenyi, Karl, Dionysus: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life 1976. *MacMullen, Ramsay, Christianizing the Roman Empire, AD 100 - 400 Yale University Press (paperback, 1986 ) *Trombley, Frank R., 1995.

By 6 February 2006, the company was forced into compulsory liquidation and Gizmondo was discontinued. Other ventures included Xero Mobile—which had a service that automatically billed advertisers based on the number of marketing messages viewed by users—and Getfugu, which developed an application that enabled consumers to retrieve web content without typing a website address or search term into a browser. Freer co-founded a crowdsourcing networking website for filmmakers, financiers, actors and fans called FilmFunds as well as the Family Tree Foundation. In 2008, Carl Freer hosted a seminar at Georgia Institute of Technology entitled \\"High Tech Ventures in Mobile Gaming and Media\\". Freer discussed his experiences, his plans for a potential rebirth of Gizmondo as well as his plans for the development of new mobile video technologies. The event took place as part of GA Tech's GVU Center Lecture series. Later that year, a relaunch of Gizmondo was aborted. In 2010, Freer co-founded Aluminaid, which makes metal-based bandages to relieve pain in patients with first- and second-degree burns. Legal issues Freer has been arrested by police in Sweden, Spain, Germany, the UK and the USA.

Freer claimed he cancelled the cheques because he \\"thought he was being sold stolen cars\\". In 2006, no charges were filed after Los Angeles police found a collection of twelve rifles and four handguns at Freer's home in an investigation that led to his arrest on suspicion of impersonating a San Gabriel Valley Transit Authority police officer to buy a .44 Magnum handgun. Authorities dropped the investigation after Freer established that he did not impersonate a police officer and showed a valid gun permit. In 2009, the law firm Patton Boggs, on behalf of clients David Warnock and Simon Davies, filed an action alleging violations of the civil RICO Act against GetFugu, Carl Freer, and other officers and directors of GetFugu. The firm followed the lawsuit with a press release that falsely claimed that GetFugu and Carl Freer were being investigated by the FBI. In 2010, on a motion by GetFugu, District Court Judge George H. King dismissed Patton Boggs' claims with prejudice. GetFugu and Freer then countersued Patton Boggs for defamation and malicious prosecution, seeking damages of over $500 million. Patton Boggs filed a special motion to strike the defamation claim, contending that the press release regarding the alleged FBI investigation, even if false, was protected by litigation privilege, but the California Court of Appeals disagreed, allowing Freer and GetFugu to proceed with the $500 million lawsuit against Patton Boggs. Patton Boggs' special motion to strike the malicious prosecution claim was also denied, holding that Patton Boggs did not have probable cause to prosecute the RICO claims. In October 2015, Carl Freer unsuccessfully sued Danish Television Channel DR3 to have his name removed from a documentary on the Stein Bagger IT Factory fraud case prior to broadcast. Following the documentary broadcast, he filed defamation claims against 5 employees of DR.

His daughter, named Dawlat Raziya Khatun, was married to the Seljuk sultan Kaykhusraw I, and he eventually became governor (emir) of part of the region under Seljuk control; he was an influential figure in the Seljuk court until his death.  Biography  Little is known of Manuel's early life. The Maurozomai, a family possibly of Peloponnesian origin, rose to prominence in the 12th century and belonged to the aristocracy.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1319–1320 Manuel has traditionally been identified as a son of Theodore Maurozomes, who served as a general under Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (), and while earlier scholars, following Paul Wittek, made him the husband of an illegitimate daughter of the emperor, more recent scholars follow the reconstruction of Konstantinos Varzos, which makes her Manuel Maurozomes' mother, thus explaining his claim to the prestigious Komnenos name.Varzos (1984), pp. 473–475 (Note 189) Around 1200, when the deposed Seljuk sultan Kaykhusraw I () came to Constantinople, Maurozomes held, according to the Seljuk chronicler Ibn Bibi, the rank of Caesar in the Byzantine court. During his stay in the Byzantine capital, Kaykhusraw was apparently baptized a Christian with Emperor Alexios III Angelos () as his godfather, and married Manuel's daughter; thus Manuel became the ancestor of the Seljuk sultans Kayqubad I () and Kaykhusraw II ().Brand (1989), p. 12 Map of southeastern Europe and Asia Minor, showing the Nicaean Empire and Seljuk Sultanate When Alexios III fled Constantinople at the approach of the Fourth Crusade in 1203, Kaykhusraw too abandoned the city and sought refuge with Manuel in his unidentified \\"fortress\\" or \\"island\\". Following the capture of Constantinople by the Crusaders and the death of Kaykhusraw's brother Rukn al-Din Suleyman, Kaykhusraw was recalled to Iconium, and Maurozomes accompanied him. They were briefly detained at Nicaea, where the local ruler (Constantine or Theodore I Laskaris) had concluded a treaty with the new Seljuk sultan, Kilij Arslan III (), but they managed to escape and eventually restore Kaykhusraw to the sultanate.Vougiouklaki (2003), Chapter 2 With Seljuk backing, Maurozomes tried now to carve out a principality for himself in Phrygia, and tried to expand his control over the rich Meander valley. There he came into conflict with the Nicaeans under Theodore Laskaris, who decisively defeated Maurozomes' Turkish troops in summer 1205. This victory, and his success over another Byzantine rival, David Komnenos, at Nicomedia shortly before that, allowed Laskaris to consolidate his rule over western Asia Minor, and have himself proclaimed Byzantine emperor.Magoulias (1984), p. 343 However, early in the next year, as Kaykhusraw and Theodore Laskaris concluded a treaty, the Seljuk sultan secured for his father-in-law a sizeable domain in the upper valley of the Meander, including the cities of Chonae and Laodicea.Magoulias (1984), p. 350 Maurozomes remained a Seljuk vassal until his death in , and played an important role in the affairs of the Seljuk state: he received the rank of emir, helped secure the accession of his grandson Kayqubad I in 1220, and participated in the Seljuk campaigns against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.Vougiouklaki (2003), Chapter 3 Claude Cahen identifies Maurozomes with a certain Emir Komnenos, who appears over the following decades as a Christian supporter of Kaykhusraw and Kayqubad.Cahen (2014), pp. 116, 210 His descendants remained active in the Seljuk court until the end of the 13th century, although they retained their Christian faith: a John Komnenos Maurozomes (probably Manuel's son), his son Isaac-John and his grandson Michael are attested in Michael's funerary inscription, dating to 1297.

Beyazıt Tower, is an 85 m (279 ft) tall fire-watch tower located in the courtyard of Istanbul University's main campus (formerly Ottoman Ministry of War) on Beyazıt Square. A fire lookout tower, fire tower or lookout tower, provides housing and protection for a person known as a \\"fire lookout\\" whose duty it is to search for wildfires in the wilderness. The fire lookout tower is a small building, usually located on the summit of a mountain or other high vantage point, in order to maximize the viewing distance and range, known as view shed. From this vantage point the fire lookout can see smoke that may develop, determine the location by using a device known as an Osborne Fire Finder, and call fire suppression personnel to the fire. Lookouts also report weather changes and plot the location of lightning strikes during storms. The location of the strike is monitored for a period of days after in case of ignition. The typical fire lookout tower consists of a small room, known as a cab located atop a large steel, or wooden tower. Historically, the tops of tall trees have also been used to mount permanent platforms. Sometimes natural rock may be used to create a lower platform. In cases where the terrain makes a tower unnecessary, the structure is known as a ground cab. Ground cabs are called towers, even if they don't sit on a tower. Towers gained popularity in the early 1900s, and fires were reported using telephones, carrier pigeons, and heliographs. Although many fire lookout towers have fallen into disrepair as a result of neglect, abandonment, and declining budgets, some fire service personnel have made an effort to preserve older fire towers, arguing that a good set of human eyes watching the forest for wildfire can be an effective and cheap fire safety measure. History =United States= A fire lookout uses an Osborne Fire Finder to obtain the azimuth and distance to a suspected fire. From these measurements he will call in a \\"Smoke Report\\". Elba Fire Tower in Minnesota Fire lookout tower in south Georgia, United States The history of fire lookout towers predates the United States Forest Service, founded in 1905. Many townships, private lumber companies, and State Forestry organizations operated fire lookout towers on their own accord. The Great Fire of 1910, also known as the Big Blowup, burned through the states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. It is still arguably the largest forest fire ever in recorded history. The smoke from this fire drifted across the entire country to Washington D.C. — both physically and politically — and it challenged the five-year-old Forest Service to address new policies regarding fire suppression, and the fire did much to create the fire rules, organizations, and policies that we have today. One of the rules as a result of the 1910 fire stated \\"all fires must be extinguished by 10 a.m. the following morning\\". To prevent and suppress fires, the U.S. Forest Service made another rule that townships, corporations and States would bear the cost of contracting fire suppression services, because at the time there was not the large Forest Service Fire Department that exists today. As a result of the above rules, early fire detection and suppression became a priority. Towers began to be built across the country. While earlier lookouts used tall trees and high peaks with tents for shelters, by 1911 permanent cabins and cupolas were being constructed on mountaintops. Beginning in 1910, the New Hampshire Timberlands Owners Association, a fire protection group, was formed and soon after, similar organizations were set up in Maine and Vermont. A leader of these efforts, W.R. Brown, an officer of the Brown Company which owned over 400,000 acres of timberland, set up a series of effective forest-fire lookout towers, possibly the first in the nation, and by 1917 helped establish a forest-fire insurance company. In 1933, during the Great Depression, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt formed the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), consisting of young men and veterans of World War I. It was during this time that the CCC set about building fire lookout towers, and access roads to those towers. The U.S. Forest Service took great advantage of the CCC workforce and initiated a massive program of construction projects, including fire lookout towers. In California alone, some 250 lookout towers and cabs were built by CCC workers between 1933 and 1942. The heyday of fire lookout towers was from 1930 through 1950. During World War II, the Aircraft Warning Service was established, operating from mid-1941 to mid-1944. Fire lookouts were assigned additional duty as Enemy Aircraft Spotters, especially on the West Coast of the United States. From the 1960s through the 1990s the towers took a back seat to new technology, aircraft, and improvements in radios. The promise of space satellite fire detection and modern cell phones tried to compete with the remaining fire lookout towers, but in several environments, the technology failed. Fires detected from space are already too large to make accurate assessments for control. Cell phones in wilderness areas still suffer from lack of signal. Today, some fire lookout towers remain in service, because having human eyes being able to detect smoke and call in the fire report allows fire management officials to decide early how the fire is to be managed. The more modern policy is to \\"manage fire\\", not simply to suppress it. Fire lookout towers provide a reduction in time of fire detection to time of fire management assessment. Idaho had the most known lookout sites (966);Ray Kresek, Fire Lookouts of the Northwest. Ye Galleon Press (Fairfield, WA), 1984, p. 9. 196 of them still exist, with roughly 60 staffed each summer. Kansas is the only U.S. state that has never had a lookout. A number of fire lookout tower stations, including many in New York State near the Adirondack Forest Preserve and Catskill Park, have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Japan= Fire lookout tower and former fire station in Japan. An on top in Japan During the Edo period in Japan housed the . Usually the fire lookout tower was built near a , and was equipped with a ladder, lookout platform, and an (ja). From these towers watchmen could observe the entire town, and in the event of a fire they would ring the alarm bell, calling up firemen and warning town residents. In some towns the bells were also used to mark the time. While the fire lookout towers remained fully equipped into the Shōwa period, they were later replaced by telephone and radio broadcasting systems in many cities. =Canada= Like the United States, fire towers were built across Canada to protect the valuable trees for the forestry industry. Most towers were built in the early 1920s to 1950s and were a mix of wood and steel structures. A total of 325 towers dotted the landscape of Ontario in the 1960s, and today approx. 156 towers span the province, but only a handful of towers remained in use after the 1970s. They are still in use in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and a few of the Maritime Provinces. Nova Scotia decommissioned the last of its 32 fire towers in 2015 and had them torn down by a contractor. =Germany= The first fire lookout tower was built to the plans of Forstmeister Walter Seitz between 1890 and 1900, located in the \\"Muskauer Forst\\" near Weißwasser. Warnings were transmitted by light signal. For transmission of location, Seitz divided the forest area into so-called \\"Jagen\\", numbered areas, with that number to be transmitted to the city.http://www.lr-online.de/regionen/weisswasser/Warnsystem-von-Walter- Seitz;art13826,1177757 retrieved Nov 9, 2014 He received a patent for this system in 1902. Seitz traveled to the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition for a presentation of his idea in the USA. =Russia= Fire station in Tsaritsin, c. 1900As wood had been key building material in Russia for centuries, urban fires were constant threat to the towns and cities. To address that issue, in the early 19th century a program was launched to construct fire stations equipped with lookout towers called kalancha, overlooking mostly low-rise quarters. Watchmen standing vigil there could signal other stations as well as their own using simple signals. Surviving towers are often local landmarks.https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3543/ City Hall and Fire Tower (Mid-19th Century), Ustiuzhna, Russia Today =Australia= Fire towers are still in use in Australia, particularly in the mountainous regions of the south-eastern states.

Jimna Fire Tower in Southeastern Queensland is the tallest fire tower in the country, at 47 meters above the ground, and is included on the state heritage register. =United States= Today hundreds of towers are still in service with paid-staff and/or volunteer citizens. In some areas, the fire lookout operator often receives hundreds of forest visitors during a weekend and provides a needed “pre-fire suppression” message, supported by handouts from the \\"Smokey Bear\\", or \\"Woodsy Owl\\" education campaigns. This educational information is often distributed to young hikers that make their way up to the fire lookout tower. In this aspect, the towers are remote way stations and interpretive centers. The fire lookout tower also acts as a sentinel in the forest attracting lost or injured hikers, that make their way to the tower knowing they can get help. In some locations around the country, fire lookout towers can be rented by public visitors that obtain a permit. These locations provide a unique experience for the camper, and in some rental locations, the check out time is enforced when the fire lookout operator returns for duty, and takes over the cab for the day shift. Fire lookout towers are an important part of American history and several organizations have been founded to save, rebuild, restore, and operate fire lookout towers. See List of fire lookout towers in the United States =Germany= Starting in 2002, traditional fire watch was replaced by \\"FireWatch\\", optical sensors located on old lookout towers or mobile phone masts. Based on a system developed by the DLR for analyzing gases and particles in space, a terrestrial version for forest fire smoke detection was developed by DLR and IQ Wireless.Space Technology Hall of Fame, \\"Inducted Technologies: 2012\\", retrieved Nov 9, 2014 Currently, about 200 of these sensors are installed around Germany, while similar systems have been deployed in other European countries, Mexico, Kazakhstan and the USA.DLR Project FireWatch, \\"FireWatch\\", retrieved July 10, 2016 =Canada= Several Canadian provinces have fire lookout towers. Dorset, Ontario's Scenic Tower was built on site of former fire lookout tower (1922-1962).  Types  =Wooden towers= Many fire lookout towers are simply cabs that have been fitted to large railroad water tank towers. These huge wooden towers could extend . One of the last wooden fire lookout towers in Southern California was the South Mount Hawkins Fire Lookout located in the Angeles National Forest. A civilian effort is underway to rebuild the tower after its tragic loss during the Curve Fire of September 2002. The typical cab of a wooden tower can be from to * Example — South Mount Hawkins before the fire * Example — Boucher Hill Lookout, Palomar Mountain State Park, San Diego CA =Steel towers= Steel towers can vary in size and height. These towers are very sturdy, but tend to sway in the wind a bit more than a wooden tower. The typical cab of a steel tower can be from to * Example — Los Pinos Lookout, Cleveland National Forest, San Diego CA * Example — Red Mountain Lookout, San Bernardino National Forest, Riverside CA * Example — High Point Lookout, Cleveland National Forest, Palomar Mountain, San Diego CA * Example — Mount Lofty Fire Tower, South Australia =Aermotors= The Aermotor Company, originally of Chicago, Illinois, was the first and lead manufacturer of steel fire towers from the nineteen-teens to the mid-twenties. These towers have very small cabs, because the towers are based upon Aermotor windmill towers. These towers are often found in the U.S. Midwest or the South, but few have made their way into the mountainous West. In the northeast, all of the towers in the Adirondack Mountains and most in the Catskills were Aermotor towers erected between 1916 and 1921. The typical cab of an Aermoter had a cab with a fire locating device mounted in the center. Access was by way of a trap door in the floor. * Example — Lakota Peak Lookout * Example — Summit Ridge Lookout * Example — The Fire Towers of New York * Example — Adirondack Towers =Ground cabs= Abandoned fire-spotting hut on Big Bald Mountain (New Brunswick), Canada (IR Walker 1986) Ground cabs are still known as \\"towers\\" even though there may be no such tower under the cab. These towers can be one, two or three stories tall with foundations made of natural stone or concrete. These towers vary greatly in size, but many are simple wooden or steel tower cabs that were constructed using the same plans, sans the tower. * Example — Tahquitz Peak Lookout * Example — Winchester Mountain Lookout * Example — Mt. Tamalpais Lookout in California =Lookout trees= The simplest kind consist only of a ladder to a suitable height. Such trees could have platforms on the ground next to them for maps and a fire finder. A more elaborate version, such as the Gloucester tree in Australia added a permanent platform to the tree by building a wooden or, later, metal structure at the top of the tree and had metal spikes hammered into the trunk to form a spiral ladder. These 'platform trees' were often equipped with telephones, fire finder tables, seats and guy- wires. =Other types= There are many different types of lookouts. In the early days, the fire lookout operator would simply climb a denuded tree and would sit upon a platform chair atop that tree. An old fishing boat was once dragged to the top of a high hill and it was used as a fire lookout tower. Very little is known about the horse mounted fire lookout, but they, too, would ride the ridges patrolling the forest for smoke.

The episode was written and directed by Alan Ball and originally aired in the United States on August 21, 2005. It was met with acclaim from both critics and viewers alike, often being cited as one of the finest series finales in the history of television. Plot The episode begins like no other: not with a death, but with a birth. Willa Fisher Chenowith is born prematurely, and Brenda is plagued by visions of Nate, who vicariously conveys Brenda's internal fears that the child will not survive and insists that he cannot accept it if she does make it and that she is \\"damaged.\\" Ruth stays by Brenda's side during Willa's recovery and stops fighting to keep Maya with her. Brenda later has a vision of Nate and Nathaniel holding Willa, with Nate showing his love for both Brenda and their daughter, suggesting that Brenda is finally positive for Willa's health and welfare. Ruth sinks even deeper into her depression when Brenda takes Maya back. George tries to comfort her and promises he will help her get through it. Ruth is helped by a phone call to Maggie when she tells Ruth that Nate was happy the night he suffered his ultimately fatal stroke. Claire gets back into photography with Ted's help, and later receives a phone call from a stock photography company in New York saying they have a position for her as a photographer's assistant. She later finds out that Olivier recommended her for the position. After finding her mother crying, she says she will stay at home to help her, but Ruth insists that she move to New York so she will not regret it later. Ruth also unfreezes the trust fund set up by her father. Claire later finds out that the photo company consolidated its operations and her position is no longer available. As she considers calling off her trip, Nate tells her she needs to go to start a new life in New York anyway, as he did years earlier when he moved to Seattle with no guarantee of employment. As per Keith's suggestion, David agrees to temporarily leave home so he can recover from the loss of his brother, and returns to the funeral home. During a nightmare, he is confronted by Nathaniel about considering leaving the business and his sexuality. He is then confronted by the attacker in a red hooded sweater that has plagued his recent thoughts. This time, David fights back and finally sees his own face, allowing him to let go of his past. Rico, disillusioned by the direction Fisher and Diaz have been taking, encourages David to sell the funeral home as he has had the business valued and realizes that his 25% share is worth $500,000, which he and Vanessa want to use to buy their own funeral home. David initially agrees, but changes his mind after having a vision of his father Nathaniel telling him that the business is his birthright. Instead, David and Keith buy out Rico's 25% share using Keith's life savings, freeing the Diaz family to pursue their own venture. Brenda also agrees to give David and Keith as much time as they need to buy her share, which she inherited from Nate. Keith and David move into the funeral home with their sons Durell and Anthony and redecorate it. Ruth initially plans to move in with George but changes her mind and instead moves in with her sister while continuing her relationship with George in separate residences. Nate visits Claire one last time as she prepares to leave for New York. The extended Fisher family (with the exception of the Diaz family who have their own family dinner to celebrate the buyout) has a farewell dinner for Claire where they reminisce about Nate, telling stories and toasting Nate's memory. The next morning, Claire has a tearful goodbye with her family and drives off into her future. The episode ends with flash-forwards to milestone events in the main characters' subsequent lives and, ultimately, their deaths. The montage, set to Sia's \\"Breathe Me\\", is intercut with views of Claire driving out of Los Angeles. In the flash-forwards, Ruth is seen enjoying life in Topanga; David teaches Durrell about embalming; the extended Fisher family celebrates Willa's birthday; and David and Keith get married. Ruth dies in 2025 of old age in the hospital, with David, Claire, and George at her side. She sees her deceased husband Nathaniel and son Nate before she dies. Ted shows up unannounced at Ruth's funeral; Claire and Ted later get married. Keith is shot and killed in 2029 by robbers while exiting an armored truck owned by his self-named security firm. At a family function in 2044, David dies of a heart attack after seeing a vision of a young Keith smiling at him. While on a cruise with his wife in 2049, Rico has a heart attack and collapses. Brenda dies of old age in 2051 at her home while her brother Billy talks to her about Claire and Ted. Finally, in 2085, having outlived them all, Claire dies at the age of 102 in her own home, with photographs of the Fisher family adorning her walls. Reception In 2006, the episode received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards. Creator Alan Ball was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Directing for a Drama series; it was also nominated for Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series and Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series.

Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, built in 1147, was the church of the prestigious Montmartre Abbey. According to the earliest biography of Saint Ignatius Loyola, the martyrium of Montmartre Abbey was the location at which the vows were taken that led to the founding of the Society of Jesus. History Saint-Pierre de Montmartre seen from the dome of the Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur. Though according to its traditional history, it was founded by Saint Denis in the third century, only scattered signs of Gallo-Roman occupation have been detected at the much- disturbed site,Bailey K. Young, \\"Archaeology in an Urban Setting: Excavations at Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre, Paris, 1975-1977\\", Journal of Field Archaeology 5.3 (Autumn 1978), pp. 319-329. The retaining wall of Sacré-Cœur (constructed in 1875) stands at the eastern edge of the much-reduced monastery site. where Théodore Vacquier, the first municipal archaeologist of Paris, identified remains of walling as belonging to the Temple of Mars, from which Montmartre took its name.The toponym Mons Martis (\\"Mount of Mars\\") survived into Merovingian times, Christianised as Montmartre. In 1657, the antiquary and local historian Henri Sauval was shown remains in the priory garden that he associated with the templum Martis. The early church,Gregory of Tours does not mention it among the churches of Paris, because Montmartre was not a part of Paris, but the Merovingian cemetery dates to the sixth and seventh centuries (Young 1978:321). a stop in the ninth century for pilgrims en route for the Saint Denis Basilica,Miracles of Saint Denis, ninth century, is the first reference to the church. belonged in 1096 to the comte de Melun. Louis VI purchased it in 1133, in order to establish in it the Montmartre Abbey, and the Merovingian church was rebuilt; it was reconsecrated by Pope Eugenius III in 1147, in a splendid royal ceremony where Bernard of Clairvaux and Peter, Abbot of Cluny acted as acolytes.Young 1978:321. The 1670s and early 1680s marked a special moment in the history of the abbey. During the years when Françoise Renée de Lorraine, the sister of Marie, Duchess of Guise, was abbess, and especially while Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, was in confined residence there (starting in 1675), music came to play an important role in the abbey religious services. Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Marie's composer, wrote devotional music to be performed there. The Benedictine community moved downhill to a new priory in the 1680s. =Destruction and rebuilding= In 1794, the apse of the church was battered by the construction of the Chappe Tower. As a result, the eastern parts of the church were not returned to worship when it reopened after the French revolution in 1803. It was in a deplorable state, and restoration campaigns in 1838-1845 and 1874 were too limited to prevent its ruin. The closure of the church for security reasons in 1896 seemed to be final, and the decision to rescue it was only taken at the last minute. The restoration was undertaken under the direction of Louis Sauvageot between 1900 and 1905, and the church of Saint-Pierre then got its current face.Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, 2018, Retrieved 2018-09-07 The church today is visited by numerous tourists who tend to notice, among other things, the columns of Roman origin used in the nave.

He was active during the colonial period and early independence. Biography Believing he had a religious vocation, he entered a monastery in Mexico City, but soon changed his mind and returned to Celaya and was married. He began working as an artist -- painting, sculpture and engraving. He soon requested permission to work as an architect. His first architectural works were the Fountain of Neptune (1797) and an arch commemorating the proclamation of Charles IV as king. Both of these are in Querétaro. From 1802 through 1807 he worked rebuilding the church of El Carmen in Celaya, in a Neoclassical style. This is considered his greatest work. The church presents three Neoclassical façades, above which rises a tower ending in a bell shape. This was a novelty in New Spain at the time of its construction. The church also includes a graceful tiled dome above the crossing and a lateral façade showing French influence. Tresguerras also executed some of the sculptures in this church. In the same city he designed the chapel for his interment in the church of San Francisco, and a bridge over the River La Laja. In Guanajuato the palace of the Count of Casa Rul is his. Professionally, he traveled widely in the central part of the country. He is also credited with other buildings in San Luis Potosí, San Miguel el Grande, Salvatierra, Salamanca, Irapuato, and some towns in Jalisco. Among his paintings are a portrait of his wife (1787), a self-portrait (1794) and two frescos in the church of El Carmen in San Luis Potosí. There is also a El Juicio Final (Last Judgment) in the chapel of Los Cofrades in the church of El Carmen de Celaya. Tresguerras also wrote devotional works and poetic satires. A notebook of critical notes was published, unedited, in 1962 under the title Ocios literarios. His friends wrote a biographical sketch entitled Tres zamoranos ilustres. This remained unpublished until 1951, when it appeared in Morelia. Tresguerras was arrested in 1811 for sympathy with the independence movement. The Museo Nacional de Artes Plásticas in Mexico City contains several of his works: *La Virgen del Carmen *Santa Rosa de Viterbo *Educación de la Virgen Statue dedicated to the celayense architect, Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras.

(, , , ), (1204 – 31 August 1240) is a saint from Catalonia in Spain. His nickname (, \\"not born\\") refers to his birth by Caesarean section, his mother having died while giving birth to him. Raymond is the patron saint of childbirth, midwives, children, pregnant women, and priests defending the confidentiality of confession. Life According to the traditions of the Mercedarian Order, he was born in the village of Portell (today part of Sant Ramon), in the Diocese of Urgell. He was taken from the womb of his mother after her death, hence his name. Some traditions describe him as the son of the local count, who is traditionally credited as the one to have performed the surgery which saved his life, others that he was born in a family of shepherds. His well-educated father planned a career for his son at the royal court of the Kingdom of Aragon. When the boy felt drawn to religious life, his father ordered him to manage one of the family farms. What is known is that Raymond spent his childhood tending sheep and would often pray at an ancient country chapel nearby dedicated to St. Nicholas. If he was of aristocratic descent, clearly his father eventually abandoned hopes for his son's social advancement. His father later gave him permission to take the habit with the Mercedarians at Barcelona. The order was founded to ransom Christian captives from the Moors of North Africa. Raymond was trained by the founder of that order himself, St. Peter Nolasco. He was ordained a priest in 1222 and later became Master General of the Order. Raymond then set out to fulfill the goals of Order. He went to Valencia, where he ransomed 140 Christians from slavery. He then traveled to North Africa, where he was able to ransom another 250 captives in Algiers, and then went to Tunis, where he is said to have surrendered himself as a hostage for 28 captive Christians when his money ran out, in keeping with a special fourth vow taken by the members of the order. He suffered in captivity as a legend states that the Moors bored a hole through his lips with a hot iron, and padlocked his mouth to prevent him from preaching. He was ransomed by his order and returned to Spain in 1239. Raymond died at the Castle of Cardona, sixty miles from Barcelona, either on August 26C. Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica, vol. I, p. 6 or on August 31, 1240.\\"Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year, edited by Rev. Hugo Hoever, S.O.Cist., Ph.D., New York: Catholic Book Publishing Co., June 1, 1955, p. 344 According to tradition, the local count, the friars and the town all claimed his body. To resolve this dispute, the body was placed on a blind mule, which was let loose. Unguided, it went to the nearby country chapel where he had prayed in his youth. It was there that he was buried. Many miracles were attributed to him before and after his death. In the historiography and hagiography from the 16th century it is repeatedly claimed that upon his return to Spain in 1239, Pope Gregory IX nominated him Cardinal Deacon of Sant'Eustachio,Cf. Eubel, p. 6 and that he died en route to Rome.\\"Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year, p. 344 Consequently, he is traditionally depicted as wearing the scarlet red mozzetta of a cardinal. However, Italian historian Agostino Paravicini Bagliani has established that this account resulted from a confusion of Raymond Nonnatus with Englishman Robert Somercote, the Cardinal Deacon of S. Eustachio 1238-1241, and has concluded that Raymond was never a cardinal.Paravicini Bagliani A., Cardinali di Curia e \\"familae\\" cardinalizia dal 1227 al 1254, Padova 1972, pt. II, p. 534-535 Raymond was canonized by Pope Alexander VII in 1657. His feast day is celebrated on August 31.\\"Martyrologium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ) Veneration The towns of Saint-Raymond, Quebec, Canada; San Ramón de la Nueva Orán, Argentina; São Raimundo Nonato, Brazil; San Ramón in Costa Rica are named for him. A shrine in Buenos Aires and the Roman Catholic Diocese of São Raimundo Nonato (Raymundianus) in Brazil are dedicated to him. In the United States, the Parish of St. Raymond, in the New York City Borough of the Bronx; the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus in Joliet, Illinois; and St. Raymond Catholic Community in Downey, California; are under his patronage. There is also a parish dedicated to him in Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico. Metropolitan Cathedral, Mexico City Due to the story of his own birth, Raymond quickly became widely invoked by women facing childbirth. Because of his limited historical importance, however, since the reforms of the Church calendar in 1969, the liturgical commemoration of Raymond's feast day is no longer included among those to be necessarily observed wherever the Roman Rite is celebrated,\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 137 but, since he is included in the Roman Martyrology for August 31, Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours may be recited in his honor on that day as in the pre-1970 General Roman Calendar, which is observed by some traditionalist Catholics. One particular devotion is centered around the padlock that is part of his martyrdom. Locks are placed at his altar representing a prayer request to end gossip, rumours, false testimonies and other sins of the tongue. The locks are used as a visible sign of such prayer request, which first and foremost must take place interiorly, a prayer to God through St. Raymond's intercession.Plate in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City. =Iconography= He is pictured in the habit of his order surrounded by ransomed slaves, with a padlock on his lips. In popular culture The 2012 BBC drama series Call the Midwife features Nonnatus House, a convent of religious sisters of the Church of England; it is set in a deprived area of the East End of London in the 1950s. Based on the successful memoir trilogy of the same name, the author Jennifer Worth used Nonnatus House as a pseudonym for the Anglican community of the Sisters of St John the Divine in Whitechapel where she actually had worked. In the Christmas special, broadcast simultaneously on PBS in America also, one of the plotlines features the discovery of an infant foundling on the convent doorstep, who is then dubbed Raymond by the nurses and sisters in honor of the closest male associated with his birth, the convent's patron. In the videogame \\"Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse\\" (2013-2014), San Ramon appears in a painting called \\"La Maledicció\\".

It is located 35 km east of Stuttgart, and 15 km northwest of Schwäbisch Gmünd. Welzheim has 11,239 (2005) inhabitants and is located in the 'Welzheimer Wald', a forest in the north-east of Württemberg. The district of Welzheim and its surrounding villages are mainly rural and agricultural. Because of the big forest areas, the timber industry remains a big part of local business. There are many beautiful natural areas near Welzheim, including the lake 'Ebnisee' and a hiking trail 'Mühlenwanderweg' (mill hiking trail), which follows many mills located in the 'Welzheimer Wald'. In the town itself, there are sights such as the St. Gallus Church and the town hall. History The history of Welzheim reaches back to the time of the Roman Empire. Around the year 160 AD the Romans founded a colony and two forts there; linguists reconstructed their Latin name as (Castra) Valentia on the base of the town's medieval name WallenzinWerner Besch (et. al.): Sprachgeschichte - Ein Handbuch zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und ihrer Erforschung, 2nd edition, 4th volume, de Gruyter, Berlin 2004, p. 3466 first mentioned in 1181. In 1980, for the 800th anniversary of the founding of the city, the eastern part of the ruins was reconstructed, and in 1993 an archeological park was founded on the site. The western part of the fort was built over through the years. The history of the settlement after the fall of the Roman Empire is in darkness, until the year 1266 when Welzheim was granted city's-rights. In 1499 the church of Saint Gallus was consecrated, presumably as a new parish. On 5 September 1726, a fire destroyed the entire city. The church was burned down to its foundations, though it was soon rebuilt. The city hall was rebuilt in 1731. The district of Welzheim became part of the county of Waiblingen in 1938, and has been a deanery of the Evangelical- Lutheran Church in Württemberg since 1977. During World War II there was a small concentration camp near the city, today identified euphemistically to as simply \\"The Prison.\\" The camp held 10,000-15,000 prisoners. The most famous prisoner during this time was the Communist labor unionist Friedrich Schlotterbeck, of the Luginsland resistance group. A previous inhabitant of Welzheim, aged ten in 1945, testified how he would witness how the camp would regularly hang several inhabitants on Tuesday to make room for incoming camp internees. [2] In the churchyard, where 35 of the concentration camp's victims are buried, there is a memorial to these events. The author Justinus Kerner lived in Welzheim from 1812 to 1816. =Churches and religious organizations= Besides the Protestant Saint Gallus church, and the Catholic Church of Christ the King, there is also a CVJM, the South German Alliance, and several other free-church unions such as the Baptists, Evangelical Free Church Union, Evangelical-Methodist Church, New Apostolic Church, the Evangelical Brethren, and even a mosque.

A person can only have one primary residence at any given time, though they may share the residence with other people. A primary residence is considered to be a legal residence for the purpose of income tax and/or acquiring a mortgage. Criteria for a primary residence consist mostly of guidelines rather than hard rules, and residential status is often determined on a case-by-case basis. Use in urban planning The primary residence is the main dwelling unit on a parcel of land. This term distinguishes this unit from a potential secondary suite. Definition in specific jurisdictions =United Kingdom= If taxpayers own a property but never lived in it, it cannot be considered their main residence even if it is the only property they own. Furthermore, the court would ask itself, in order to determine whether the property is their main residence, whether a reasonable person would consider the property their home in light of all the facts surrounding the case. Williams v Horsham Dristrict Council [2004] EWCA Civ 39 A ship cannot be considered a residence, and property on land that a person returns to after being at sea would be considered his main residence.Bradford City Council v Anderton (1991) 89 L.G.R. 681 If a person is forced away from the property that would ordinarily be called \\"home\\" because of employment but still occasionally return to that property, then it is still classed as their main residence. In Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council v Stark,[1998] R.V.R. 80 Mr Stark, an RAF serviceman, returned to his matrimonial home only when on leave. The court rejected Mrs Stark's claim that she was entitled to the single person's 25% rebate on rates owed the Council. The court ruled that she was not a single person, because the property was also Mr Stark's main residence, that is, where Mr Stark would have lived were it not for the demands of his occupation. =United States= The requirements to validate your principal residence vary and depend on the agency requesting verification. On the federal level, the taxpayer's principal residence may in general include a houseboat, a house trailer, or the house or apartment that the taxpayer is entitled to occupy as a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation, in addition to the traditional house. Specifically, Treasury Regulation Section 1.121-1(b)(2) gives the following requirements: In the case of a taxpayer using more than one property as a residence, whether property is used by the taxpayer as the taxpayer’s principal residence depends upon all the facts and circumstances. If a taxpayer alternates between 2 properties, the property that the taxpayer uses a majority of the time during the year ordinarily will be considered the taxpayer’s principal residence. In addition to the taxpayer's use of the property, relevant factors in determining a taxpayer's principal residence, include, but are not limited to - (i) The taxpayer's place of employment; (ii) The principal place of abode of the taxpayer's family members; (iii) The address listed on the taxpayer's federal and state tax returns, driver's license, automobile registration, and voter registration card; (iv) The taxpayer's mailing address for bills and correspondence; (v) The location of the taxpayer's banks; and (vi) The location of religious organizations and recreational clubs with which the taxpayer is affiliated. In the United States, a primary residence is understood to be a property that one has regular access to, as opposed to a property one owns but does not have access to due to it being rented out to others. This can affect eligibility for a mortgage or home equity loan, with requirements generally being looser for getting a loan for a property one lives in, it being believed that a homeowner will try harder to pay the loan if they risk losing their primary residence. Fraudulent representation of a person's primary residence can result in significant financial downside and potential criminal charges.

Information contained in the owner's manual typically includes: * Safety instructions; for liability reasons these can be extensive, often including warnings against performing operations that are ill-advised for product longevity or overall user safety reasons. * Assembly instructions; for products that arrive in pieces for easier shipping. * Installation instructions; for products that need to be installed in a home or workplace. * Setup instructions; for devices that keep track of time or which maintain user accessible state. * Instructions for normal or intended operations. * Programming instructions; for microprocessor controlled products such as VCRs, programmable calculators, and synthesizers. * Maintenance instructions. * Troubleshooting instructions; for when the product does not work as expected. * Service locations; for when the product requires repair by a factory authorized technician. * Regulatory code compliance information; for example with respect to safety or electromagnetic interference. * Product technical specifications. * Warranty information; sometimes provided as a separate sheet. Until the last decade or two of the twentieth century it was common for an owner's manual to include detailed repair information, such as a circuit diagram; however as products became more complex this information was gradually relegated to specialized service manuals, or dispensed with entirely, as devices became too inexpensive to be economically repaired. Owner's manuals for simpler devices are often multilingual so that the same boxed product can be sold in many different markets. Sometimes the same manual is shipped with a range of related products so the manual will contain a number of sections that apply only to some particular model in the product range. With the increasing complexity of modern devices, many owner's manuals have become so large that a separate quickstart guide is provided. Some owner's manuals for computer equipment are supplied on CD-ROM to cut down on manufacturing costs, since the owner is assumed to have a computer able to read the CD-ROM. Another trend is to supply instructional video material with the product, such as a videotape or DVD, along with the owner's manual. Many businesses offer PDF copies of manuals that can be accessed or downloaded free of charge from their websites.  Installation manual  An installation manual or installation guide is a technical communication document intended to instruct people how to install a particular product. An installation manual is usually written by a technical writer or other technical staff. Installation is the act of putting something in place so that it is ready for use.Definition of “installation” from the Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary An installation manual most commonly describes the safe and correct installation of a product. The term product here relates to any consumer, non-consumer, hardware, software, electrical, electronic or mechanical product that requires installation. The installation of a computer program is also known as the setup. A sample of an installation manual In case of an installation manual, the installation instruction is a separate document that focuses solely on the person(s) that will perform the installation. However, the installation instruction can also be an integrated part of the overall owner's manual. The size, structure and content of an installation manual depend heavily on the nature of the product and the needs and capabilities of the intended target group. Furthermore, various standards and directives are available that provide guidance and requirements for the design of instructions. The international standard IEC 82079IEC 82079-1:2012, p. 31, 5 Content of instructions for use prescribes the required installation topics for an installation instruction. Among these topics, are procedures, diagrams and conditions for installation activities, such as unpacking, mounting and connecting. For machines the European Machinery Directive prescribes that an instruction manual must contain assembly, installation and connecting instructions, including drawings, diagrams and the means of attachment and the designation of the chassis or installation on which the machinery is to be mounted.Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC , p. 25-26, 1.7.4.2 Contents of the instructions.  Car owner's manuals  All new cars come with an owner's manual from the manufacturer. Most owners leave them in the glove compartment for easy reference. This can make their frequent absence in rental cars frustrating because it violates the driver's user expectations, as well as makes it difficult to use controls that aren't understood, which is not good because understanding control operation of an unfamiliar car is one of the first steps recommended in defensive driving. Owner's manuals usually cover three main areas: a description of the location and operation of all controls; a schedule and descriptions of maintenance required, both by the owner and by a mechanic; and specifications such as oil and fuel capacity and part numbers of light bulbs used. Current car owner's manuals have become much bigger in part due to many safety warnings most likely designed to avoid product liability lawsuits, as well as from ever more complicated audio and navigational systems, which often have their own manual. If owners lose their car manual, they can either order a replacement from a dealer, pick up a used one secondhand, or download a PDF version of the manual online.

Etymology  Mount Susitna is often called The Sleeping Lady for its resemblance to a recumbent woman. The name is thought to have originated from a short story written by Nancy Lesh and published in the Alaska Northern Lights magazine in the early 1960s. In the story, a woman named Susitna belonging to a race of giants vows to sleep until her beloved comes back from battle. In \\"The Sleeping Lady\\", a children's picture book written by Ann Dixon in 1964, the giant woman fell asleep waiting for her beloved to return from battle, unaware that he had been killed. Dixon and her publisher were sued for their version of the story, but a judge ruled that the story had become a legend, and was therefore uncopyrightable. The mountain's Dena'ina name is Dghelishla, meaning \\"Little Mountain\\"; in English it was simply named for the Susitna River which means Sandy River. \\"Dinglishna\\" in Alaska is a similar word which means \\"Little Ridge that Extends\\". This is pointed out on page 113 of the second edition of Shem Pete's Alaska 2003. In \\"A Dena'ina Legacy,\\" Peter Kalifornsky a Dena'ina Athabascan elder tells the story of the Mountain People who gathered at Susitna, and a giant lady who said she would lie down by the river she loved to become Susitna Mountain. Her relatives followed, Kalifornsky said, to become Mount Redoubt, Mount Iliamna and the Chigmit Mountain Range. Another wandered inland to become Denali. Geology =Pleistocene= Mt. Susitna is a roche moutonnée, a landform created when a glacier flows over a resistant, topographically high, bedrock body, creating a smooth-sided and teardrop shaped feature aligned with the direction of ice flow. The Anchorage bowl topography has been influenced by 5-7 glaciations. Over several thousand years, thick ice sheets from the Talkeetna, Chugach and Alaska Ranges flowed down Cook Inlet. The five well documented glaciations from oldest to most recent were the Mt Susitna, Caribou Hills, Eklutna, Knik and Naptowne. The earliest glaciation in the Anchorage area is known as the Mount Susitna for the erratics and other glacial features found on the top of Mount Susitna. This is the time period when it obtained its characteristic streamlined shape. It is dated to the late Pliocene to the early Pleistocene (2-6 million years ago). =Mesozoic= Mt. Susitna is part of a suite of Jurassic plutons of quartz monzonite to granodiorite composition.

(Played by Fred Neuman) *Angel Lips, an android and former companion of Teru who has been programmed to be self- programming, thus giving her a will of her own.

Gampelen should not be confused with the municipality Gampel in the canton of Valais. History Gampelen is first mentioned in 1179 as Champion and again in 1228 as Champlun. The area around Gampelen was home to several mesolithic, neolithic and Bronze Age settlements. One of the largest was a Late Bronze Age lake front settlement on Witzwil Island. Bricks, money and a dam from Roman era settlements have been found stretching from Zihlbrücke in Gals through Gampelen to Witzwil in Ins. During the Middle Ages it was part of the Herrschaft of Erlach. In 1395 the area became part of the County of Savoy. Almost a century later, in 1474, it was acquired by Berne and was placed in the bailiwick of Erlach. The village church of St. Martin was first mentioned in 1228. It was destroyed in a fire and rebuilt in 1513 and the nave was expanded and renovated in 1674-75. The church was probably built over a Roman inn and way station. During the Protestant Reformation it became the parish church of the local parish, which eventually grew to include the neighboring municipality of Gals. During the Middle Ages and Early Modern era, Gampelen was surrounded by extensive vineyards. Several residents grew wealthy from the vineyards and built large mansions or manor houses in the village. The Jura water correction project of 1874-83 drained the marshy meadows around the village. The former marshes became fields for sugar beet and other vegetables. In 1901 the Bern–Neuchâtel railway line was built through the town. The railway allowed the village's agricultural products to reach distant markets. Today the railway is mostly used for commuters, with about half of all workers in Gampelen commuting to jobs in nearby towns and cities. The Fanel nature preserve and bird sanctuary along the lake is a sanctuary of European importance. Geography Gampelen has an area of . Of this area, or 56.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 25.0% is forested.

Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 47.1% is used for growing crops and 8.1% is pastures, while 1.5% is used for orchards or vine crops. Of the water in the municipality, 0.3% is in lakes and 1.8% is in rivers and streams. Gampelen is the only municipality in the canton of Bern bordering Lake Neuchâtel, and as such is the only German-speaking municipality along the lake. The town of Gampelen has a long, thin shape, and has a railway station on the Bern-Neuenburg line of the BLS. The stop Zihlbrücke also lies within the area of the municipality. Gampelen is part of an evangelical-reformed parish with neighboring Gals. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Erlach, the municipality's former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Seeland.Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 4 April 2011 Coat of arms The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules a Bittern head erased Or.Flags of the World.com accessed 1 November 2012 Demographics Gampelen has a population () of . , 14.4% of the population are resident foreign nationals.Statistical office of the Canton of Bern accessed 4 January 2012 Over the last 10 years (2000-2010) the population has changed at a rate of 8.9%.

It superseded the post-World War II provisional Small Constitution of 1947, which in turn replaced the pre-war April Constitution of 1935. The 1952 constitution introduced a new name for the Polish state, the Polish People's Republic (Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa, PRL), replacing the previously used Republic of Poland (Rzeczpospolita Polska). The communist-led Sejm (legislature) was declared to be the highest state authority. The real source of supreme state power, the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), was not regulated by the constitution; it was ruled by its own statute. The constitution legalized many practices that had been introduced in Poland, in the wake of the Soviet Red Army and the Polish People's Army defeat of Nazi Germany in 1944–1945, by Polish-communist governmental bodies, including the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) and its successors. Instead of the traditional separation of powers, the constitution introduced the Soviet concept of \\"unity of the state's power\\". While the ultimate power was reserved for the dictatorship of the proletariat, expressed as \\"the working people of towns and villages\\", the Sejm was granted on paper the paramount authority in government; it oversaw both the judicial and executive branches. However, the Sejm in practice exercised little or no real power. Under the constitution, the Polish Council of State replaced the office of the President of Poland as the head of state organ. The constitution was amended twenty-four times, with the most contentious amendment being that of 10 February 1976. It was significantly amended during the Polish transformation, in 1989 and 1992; from 29 December 1989 the document was known as the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. It was superseded by a new Constitution of Poland on 17 October 1997. Legislative branch In the 1946 Polish people's referendum the Senate of Poland had been abolished with the Sejm remaining the sole legislative body in Poland. Under the 1952 constitution, the Sejm officially became the \\"supreme organ of state power\\" under article 20. The Sejm of the Polish People's Republic started with 425 members in 1952 (one deputy represented 60,000 citizens). However, as the population grew, the number of deputies increased. By 1960 the constitution was amended, dropping the calculation and stabilizing the Sejm at 460 deputies. A \\"proportional\\" attribute was dropped from the five-point electoral law previously used. An article in the constitution stated that deputies were responsible to the people and could be recalled by the people, although this article was never used. Legislation was passed by majority vote. The Sejm voted on the budget and national plans as proposed by the executive. The Sejm deliberated in sessions, which were called by the Council of State elected by the Sejm from its members. The Sejm also chose a Presidium from its members, with the Marshal of the Sejm always being a member of the United People's Party. During its first session the Sejm nominated the Prime Minister together with other ministers (the Council of Ministers), and members of the Council of State. Many other government officials were also chosen, including the head of the Supreme Audit Office (Najwyższa Izba Kotroli, NIK), members of the State Tribunal (Trybunał Stanu) and Constitutional Tribunal (Trybunał Konstytucyjny), as well as the Ombudsman (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich) (the latter three institutions were created in the 1980s). In practice, like its counterparts in other communist regimes, the Sejm did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the PZPR. Executive branch A meeting of the Polish Council of State during the 1960s Executive power was held by the Council of Ministers and the Council of State. The Council of State replaced the previous Polish head of the state, the President of Poland (which terminated the presidency of Bolesław Bierut). Article 29 provided that Council of State members were elected at the first session of the Sejm for the term of the Sejm (established at four years by Article 28). The council was composed of members of the Sejm; they were usually chosen from the dominant Polish United Workers' Party, although occasionally other deputies were chosen. The council acted as the head of state (in practice the body was represented by the Chairman of the Council of State). Article 30 of the constitution set out the authority of the Council of State, including representing the Polish People's Republic in foreign relations and in ratification of international treaties. The council also voted in matters related to the military. It granted citizenship and could invoke pardon. The council not only had legislative initiative under Article 25, but could issue administrative decrees under Article 31. However, those decrees had to be confirmed by the Sejm in its next session. The council also defined the interpretation of laws, which in many countries is reserved to the judiciary. The Council of Ministers also had legislative initiative under Article 25. The composition of the Council of Ministers was set forth in Article 39. The Council of Ministers developed the state budget and socio- economic plans and presented them to the Sejm for approval. After approval the Council of Ministers oversaw the execution of the plans and the budget. Judiciary The Supreme Court was the overseer of all other courts, which were divided into regional (voivodeship) and particular (administrative and military). In 1980, the Supreme Administrative Court was introduced. In 1982, the State Tribunal (which also existed in the Second Polish Republic), the Constitutional Tribunal, and the Ombudsman office were introduced. Amendments During its forty-five years of service, the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic was subject to many changes, with its text amended 24 times. The most controversial amendment was that of 10 February 1976. The proposed amendment declared that Poland was a socialist country, the PZPR was the leading force in the building of socialism and Poland shared \\"unshakable fraternal bonds\\" with the Soviet Union. The amendment caused protests resulting in the Letter of 59, asking for inclusion of human rights as stated in the Helsinki Accords. The government backed off somewhat, and the final amendment deleted the phrase \\"citizens' rights depend upon fulfillment of civic duties\\", changed \\"unshakable fraternal bonds\\" to \\"strengthening of friendship\\" and made other conciliatory changes, but after the revised amendment passed there were still protests from the Catholic Church and intellectuals. The constitution was heavily amended during the period of political transformation. The amendments purged the document of its state socialist phrasing. Among the more important changes were: * In April 1989, the April Novelization was passed, restoring the Senate of Poland and the office of President of Poland. Wojciech Jaruzelski, elected in 1989, became the first president of Poland since 1952. * In December 1989, the Contract Sejm changed the official name of the country from the Polish People's Republic to the Republic of Poland and removed references to Poland being a socialist state.See Article 1, Section 4, paragraph 1 and Article 1, section 8, * On 17 October 1992, much of the constitution was replaced by the Small Constitution of 1992.  Synopsis  The 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union was an exemplar act and the Russian translation of the draft text of the 1952 Constitution was personally reviewed and corrected by Joseph Stalin; his modifications were inserted into the Polish text by Bolesław Bierut. The chief role of the 1952 Constitution was to ratify and secure communist rule in Poland, however, it failed to regulate the main source of power – the communist party (PZPR). The constitution served as a propaganda tool, proclaiming the \\"Polish People's Republic\\", and in theory establishing many rights for its citizens. In the 1970s and 1980s, the provisions of the constitution enabled opposition activists to challenge the authorities and accuse them of not complying with the constitution.

A native of Los Angeles, Donner worked steadily in television and film since the 1950s including early work on The Guiding Light and As the World Turns. Honing his craft, he performed in seven successive seasons of New York City regional and stock theater. Beginning in the 1960s he had many guest star and co- starring roles in shows including The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Mission Impossible (eleven episodes — the most by any guest star), Mannix, Kojak and The Streets of San Francisco. However, Donner was probably best known for his role of Romulan Subcommander Tal in the original Star Trek episode \\"The Enterprise Incident\\". He would later return as a Vulcan priest in the episodes \\"Kir'Shara\\" and \\"Home\\" of Star Trek: Enterprise. Along with Joseph Ruskin and Clint Howard, he is one of only three actors to appear in both the original Star Trek series and Star Trek: Enterprise. In 1998 he appeared in the uncredited role of Commander Kinwon in Power Rangers in Space. He had a recurring role on General Hospital as Nikolas and Spencer Cassadine's butler Alfred. Donner starred in Peaches Christ's black comedy film All About Evil and in Bryan Moore's adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's Cool Air. He also had a brief but memorable scene as a fire-and-brimstone prosecutor who demands death in 1971's The Night God Screamed. He founded Oxford Theater with fellow actor Lee Delano. Their students included Barry Levinson, Craig T. Nelson, Barbara Parkins, and Don Johnson.

Signs and symptoms An example of severe rhinophyma. Rhinophyma is characterised by prominent pores and a fibrous thickening of the nose, sometimes with papules. It is associated with the common skin condition rosacea. It can carry a strong psychological impact due to its effect on one's personal appearance.  Causes  Alcoholism is mistakenly attributed as a cause of this issue. Alcohol, however, may cause increased flushing in those affected. Pathophysiology Rhinophyma is a slowly progressive condition due to hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands of the tip of the nose often seen in cases of long-standing rosacea; it is not a cancer. It presents as a pink, lobulated mass over the nose with dilation of the superficial blood vessels; it mostly affects men past middle age. People affected by rhinophyma typically seek advice because of the perceived unsightly appearance of the enlargement, or obstruction in breathing and vision. Diagnosis Rhinophyma may be diagnosed without testing, but a skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment Treatment consists of paring down the bulk of the tissue with a sharp instrument or carbon dioxide laser and allowing the area to re- epithelialise. Sometimes, the tissue is completely excised and the raw area skin-grafted.Dhingra P.L.

Block diagram Successive-approximation ADC block diagram Key : DAC = digital-to-analog converter : EOC = end of conversion : SAR = successive approximation register : S/H = sample and hold circuit : VIN = input voltage : VREF = reference voltage  Algorithm  The successive-approximation analog-to-digital converter circuit typically consists of four chief subcircuits: # A sample- and-hold circuit to acquire the input voltage Vin. # An analog voltage comparator that compares Vin to the output of the internal DAC and outputs the result of the comparison to the successive-approximation register (SAR). # A successive-approximation register subcircuit designed to supply an approximate digital code of Vin to the internal DAC. # An internal reference DAC that, for comparison with Vref, supplies the comparator with an analog voltage equal to the digital code output of the SARin. Animation of a 4-bit successive- approximation ADC The successive approximation register is initialized so that the most significant bit (MSB) is equal to a digital 1. This code is fed into the DAC, which then supplies the analog equivalent of this digital code (Vref/2) into the comparator circuit for comparison with the sampled input voltage. If this analog voltage exceeds Vin, then the comparator causes the SAR to reset this bit; otherwise, the bit is left as 1. Then the next bit is set to 1 and the same test is done, continuing this binary search until every bit in the SAR has been tested. The resulting code is the digital approximation of the sampled input voltage and is finally output by the SAR at the end of the conversion (EOC). Mathematically, let Vin = xVref, so x in [−1, 1] is the normalized input voltage. The objective is to approximately digitize x to an accuracy of 1/2n. The algorithm proceeds as follows: # Initial approximation x0 = 0. # ith approximation xi = xi−1 − s(xi−1 − x)/2i, where, s(x) is the signum function (sgn(x) = +1 for x ≥ 0, −1 for x < 0). It follows using mathematical induction that xn − x ≤ 1/2n. As shown in the above algorithm, a SAR ADC requires: # An input voltage source Vin. # A reference voltage source Vref to normalize the input. # A DAC to convert the ith approximation xi to a voltage. # A comparator to perform the function s(xi − x) by comparing the DAC's voltage with the input voltage. # A register to store the output of the comparator and apply xi−1 − s(xi−1 − x)/2i. right Example: The ten steps to converting an analog input to 10 bit digital, using successive approximation, are shown here for all voltages from 5 V to 0 V in 0.1 V iterations. Since the reference voltage is 5 V, when the input voltage is also 5 V, all bits are set. As the voltage is decreased to 4.9 V, only some of the least significant bits are cleared. The MSB will remain set until the input is one half the reference voltage, 2.5 V. The binary weights assigned to each bit, starting with the MSB, are 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, 0.15625, 0.078125, 0.0390625, 0.01953125, 0.009765625, 0.0048828125. All of these add up to 4.9951171875, meaning binary 1111111111, or one LSB less than 5. When the analog input is being compared to the internal DAC output, it effectively is being compared to each of these binary weights, starting with the 2.5 V and either keeping it or clearing it as a result. Then by adding the next weight to the previous result, comparing again, and repeating until all the bits and their weights have been compared to the input, the end result, a binary number representing the analog input, is found. =Variants= ; Counter type ADC: The D to A converter can be easily turned around to provide the inverse function A to D conversion. The principle is to adjust the DAC's input code until the DAC's output comes within ± LSB to the analog input which is to be converted to binary digital form. ; Servo tracking ADC: It is an improved version of a counting ADC. The circuit consists of an up-down counter with the comparator controlling the direction of the count. The analog output of the DAC is compared with the analog input. If the input is greater than the DAC output signal, the output of the comparator goes high and the counter is caused to count up. The tracking ADC has the advantage of being simple. The disadvantage, however, is the time needed to stabilize as a new conversion value is directly proportional to the rate at which the analog signal changes. Charge-redistribution successive-approximation ADC Charge-scaling DAC One of the most common implementations of the successive-approximation ADC, the charge-redistribution successive-approximation ADC, uses a charge-scaling DAC. The charge-scaling DAC simply consists of an array of individually switched binary-weighted capacitors. The amount of charge upon each capacitor in the array is used to perform the aforementioned binary search in conjunction with a comparator internal to the DAC and the successive-approximation register. 3 bits simulation of a capacitive ADC # The capacitor array is completely discharged to the offset voltage of the comparator, VOS. This step provides automatic offset cancellation (i.e. the offset voltage represents nothing but dead charge, which can't be juggled by the capacitors). # All of the capacitors within the array are switched to the input signal Vin. The capacitors now have a charge equal to their respective capacitance times the input voltage minus the offset voltage upon each of them. # The capacitors are then switched so that this charge is applied across the comparator input, creating a comparator input voltage equal to −Vin. # The actual conversion process proceeds. First, the MSB capacitor is switched to Vref, which corresponds to the full-scale range of the ADC. Due to the binary-weighting of the array, the MSB capacitor forms a 1:1 charge divider with the rest of the array. Thus, the input voltage to the comparator is now −Vin \\\\+ Vref/2. Subsequently, if Vin is greater than Vref/2, then the comparator outputs a digital 1 as the MSB, otherwise it outputs a digital 0 as the MSB. Each capacitor is tested in the same manner until the comparator input voltage converges to the offset voltage, or at least as close as possible given the resolution of the DAC. = Use with non-ideal analog circuits = When implemented as an analog circuit – where the value of each successive bit is not perfectly 2N (e.g. 1.1, 2.12, 4.05, 8.01, etc.) – a successive- approximation approach might not output the ideal value because the binary search algorithm incorrectly removes what it believes to be half of the values the unknown input cannot be. Depending on the difference between actual and ideal performance, the maximal error can easily exceed several LSBs, especially as the error between the actual and ideal 2N becomes large for one or more bits. Since the actual input is unknown, it is therefore very important that accuracy of the analog circuit used to implement a SAR ADC be very close to the ideal 2N values; otherwise, it cannot guarantee a best match search.

He inaugurated his practice in São Paulo in 1955 and worked on over 400 projects. He is best known for his single-family houses and urban projects, among them the new town of Caraíba in the State of Bahia, Brazil. Bibliography *Junqueira, M. Joaquim Guedes.

Raw oysters are skewered, alternating with pieces of partially cooked bacon. The entire dish is then broiled or breaded (usually with corn flour) then either deep fried or sautéed. The traditional presentation is on triangles of toast with the skewer removed and dusted with salt and pepper or topped with either Maitre d'Hotel butter or a Meunière sauce. When prepared well, the dish should have a crispy exterior and a soft savory center with a textural contrast between the bacon and the oyster. It was usually offered on restaurant menus as an appetizer; but was also a popular lunch entrée. History At one time, it was a ubiquitous option on menus across the spectrum of New Orleans restaurants. The dish is served, as of November 2015, at Galatoire's.

On 1 January 2019 the former municipality of Golaten merged into the municipality of Kallnach. History Aerial view of Oberruntigen and Golaten by Walter Mittelholzer (1925) Golaten is first mentioned in 983-93 as Gulada. In 1277 it was mentioned as Golatun. The oldest trace of a settlement in the area are Roman era bricks and pottery fragments which were found near the Wittenberg farm. By the 10th century St. Maurice's Abbey was the largest landholder in the village. It eventually became part of the Herrschaft of Oltigen. The entire Herrschaft was absorbed by Bern in 1410/12, including Golaten. The village was always part of the parish of Kerzers. During the Protestant Reformation both municipalities converted to the new faith and Golaten remained part of the Kerzers parish. In 1793, it fought with the neighboring communities, in the Canton of Fribourg, over the Golatenmoos moor. The Golatenmoos is now part of the Bernese municipality of Kallnach. After the 1798 French invasion, Golaten remained part of the Canton of Bern, despite attempts by the Canton of Fribourg to annex it. Today about half of the population of the municipality commute to jobs in Kerzers or Bern. Geography Fields at the municipal border Golaten has an area of .

Since the late 18th century, when Anquetil-Duperron and others made portions of the Avesta available to western scholarship, several scholars have sought a representative botanical equivalent of the haoma as described in the texts and as used in living Zoroastrian practice. Most of the proposals concentrated either on linguistic evidence, or on comparative pharmacology, or on reflected ritual use. Rarely were all three considered together, which usually resulted in such proposals being quickly rejected. Candidates for the identity of soma The Rigveda calls the plant soma the \\"Creator of the Gods\\" and gives soma precedence above Indra and the other Gods calling soma \\"a God for Gods\\". soma was generally assumed to be entheogenic, based on Note, there are numerous similar references in the Vedas, e.g. , , , , Some descriptions of soma are associated with tapas (heat, excitement, \\"energy\\"). Soma is associated with the warrior-god Indra, and appears to have been drunk before battle. For these reasons, there are stimulant (amphetamine-like) plants as well as entheogenic plants among the candidates that have been suggested. Soma is also often associated with Light and Indra is the \\"Lord of Light\\" as shown in . Several texts like the Atharva Veda extol the medicinal properties of soma and he is regarded as the king of medicinal herbs (and also of the Brahmana class). =Somalata= When the ritual of somayajna is held today in South India, the herb which is used is the somalata (Sarcostemma acidum), a leafless plant that grows in rocky places all over India. =Fly- agaric= Fly-agaric (Amanita muscaria). From the late 1960s onwards, several studies attempted to establish soma as a psychotropic substance. A number of proposals were made, included an important one in 1968 by Robert Gordon Wasson, an amateur mycologist, who (on Vedic evidence) asserted that soma was an inebriant, and suggested fly-agaric mushroom, Amanita muscaria, as the likely candidate. Wasson and his co-author, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, drew parallels between Vedic descriptions and reports of Siberian uses of the fly- agaric in shamanic ritual. Furthermore, the mountainous origin of soma matches the habitat of fly-agaric, and when discussing soma, the Vedas do not mention any part of a flowering tree. In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory and drew attention to ephedrine (in particular to that extracted from Ephedra sinica), and noted that it \\"is a powerful stimulant, and would thus be a more plausible preparation for warriors about to go into battle than the fly-agaric, which is a depressant.\\" (for use of parahaoma by soldiers, see reference to the Ab-Zohr in Denkard 8.25.24). This was in turn contradicted in 1974 by Iranologist Ilya Greshevitch, who determined that, in small doses, fly-agaric was indeed a stimulant. In any case, since the \\"weapon\\" that Indra uses is the \\"Vajra\\" which emits \\"lightning bolts\\", the \\"battles\\" could not have been physical ones. J. P. Mallory rejects Wasson's argument that the absence of Vedic descriptions of plant parts point to a fungus, since the Vedas do not describe the plant from which is extracted at all; he explains the references in mountains as a metaphor \\"recalling soma's lofty origins\\". =Psilocybe cubensis= Psilocybe cubensis mushroom Terence McKenna in his book \\"The Food of Gods\\" takes issue with the Amanita muscaria theory and suggests the psilocybin-containing Psilocybe cubensis mushroom as a soma candidate. McKenna argues that effects of the A. muscaria mushrooms contradict the description of the properties described in the Rigveda. Mushrooms of A. muscaria have properties that are arguably more deliriant than psychedelic. Psilocybin, the active psychoactive component in P. cubensis, has a strong mind-altering effect. McKenna cites other cultures who use and venerate psychedelic plant- drugs in religious ceremonies such as at Chavin de Huantar, Peru. Gordon Wasson, who initially suggested that the soma plant was A. muscaria, described Psilocybe cubensis as \\"easily identified and gathered\\" in India, and eventually hypothesized, along with McKenna, that P. cubensis was perhaps the true identity of soma. McKenna and Wasson both unsuccessfully attempted to use A. muscaria to achieve a state of consciousness conducive to the development of a religion. The 9th mandala of the Rigveda suggests that the cow is the embodiment of soma, which provides support for McKenna's theory because P. cubensis is known to grow in cow dung. A study by Griffiths et al. concluded that psilocybin is capable of producing mystical experiences. These experiences may be conducive to the development of a religious ritual. It is worth noting that the experience of death and rebirth can be brought on by psychedelic drugs, but it is also a central concept of Hinduism (i.e. saṃsāra). Most promising evidence has been found to be in an ancient rug depicting that of what appears to be kings, priests, and/or even warriors where one is holding this type of mushroom. The rug shows an offering for the haoma ritual next to fire. =Peganum harmala= Harmal seed capsules In 1989, David Flattery, with linguistic support from Martin Schwarz, concentrated again on Iranian haoma. The two again paid particular attention to the hallucinogenic properties that may be interpreted from the texts, and discounted Ephedra because they could not observe Zoroastrian priests becoming intoxicated. They concluded that it was \\"therefore neither likely that Ephedra was a substitute for *sauma nor that it was *sauma itself\\" and that the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine alkaloids extracted from Ephedra had to be mixed with the extract from some other plant to achieve the described effects. Flattery proposed the second plant was Peganum harmala (harmal, harmel, Syrian rue, see also harmaline), known in Iranian languages as esfand, sepand or other similar terms related to Avestan word spenta ('sacred', 'holy'). Flattery considered harmel to be the real haoma, with Ephedra only being the secondary ingredient in the parahaoma mixture. Other reasons for preferring Peganum harmala as the identity of soma-haoma is the use of similar chemicals in some South American cultures in a manner reminiscent of the purported role of the drink in Indo-Iranian texts, and its being the only incense plant with hallucinogenic properties in Iran. Peganum harmala contains harmaline, which is a strong MAO-inhibitor, and it is therefore often used as a first component in ayahuasca ceremonies in order to inhibit the metabolisation of an orally administered DMT molecule (2nd component). Since co-occurrence of DMT-carrying Phalaris grass and Harmala were observed at Yazd, Persepolis, Merv and Termez,Hromada, Daniel Devatman (2015),The Somahuasca Hypothesis the hypothesis stating that soma/haoma was a biochemical Eurasian correlate of ayahuasca cannot be excluded a priori. =Ephedra= Ephedra distachya Another candidate of the non-hallucinogenic, stimulant hypothesis is a species of the genus Ephedra. Ephedrine, the agent substance in this plant, has a chemical structure similar to amphetamines, and it results in high blood-pressure; according to anecdotal reports, it has a stimulating effect more potent than that of caffeine. In the late 19th century, the highly conservative Zoroastrians of Yazd province in Iran were found to use Ephedra, which was locally known as hum or homa and which they exported to the Indian Zoroastrians. J.E.T. Aitchison, \\"The botany of the Afghan delimitation commission\\" Trans. LinnEan Soc. of London., 1888. The plant, as Falk also established, requires a cool (but not cold) and dry climate, i.e. it does not grow in India (which is too hot and/or too humid) but thrives in central Asia. Ephedra distachya is native to southern Europe and northern Asia. Later, it was discovered that a number of Iranian languages and Persian dialects have hom or similar terms as the local name for some variant of Ephedra. Ephedra plants are shrubs, measuring between 0.2 and 4 meters, with numerous green or yellowish stems. There are about 30 species, mainly Eurasian. The species growing in mountainous regions have the highest ephedrine content (up to 3% in the case of Ephedra equisetina). The marrow in the stems is brown-coloured in some species, reminiscent of Sanskrit babhru (\\"greyish-brown\\"), used exclusively in the Vedas to describe the extract. The different species of Ephedra are not well known, and their taxonomy is in a state of confusion. Assuming a Pontic-Caspian home of Indo-Iranian religions (see Kurgan), the only likely candidate is E. distachya, still used in Iranian folk medicine. The native name for Ephedra in most Indo-Iranian languages of Central Asia is derived from *sauma- (e.g. Nepali somalata, Pashto Oman/unan, Baluchi hum/huma/uma). In 1989, in a highly influential text, Harry Falk pointed out that both the Flattery and Wasson arguments assumed that haoma was hallucinogenic, although the effect desired by Zoroastrian and Vedic ritual use was not. Falk noted that, in the texts, both haoma and soma were said to enhance alertness and awareness, did not coincide with the consciousness altering effects of an entheogen, and that \\"there is nothing shamanistic or visionary either in early Vedic or in Old Iranian texts,\\" nor could the small doses administered in living Zoroastrian custom justify its consideration as an inebriant. Living custom also does not give the extract enough time to ferment. Falk established that the effect of the alkaloid ephedrine was, in many respects, similar to adrenaline, but \\"its actions are less intense but more prolonged than those of adrenaline, and, most important, it prevents sleeping.\\" Chemically, ephedrine is similar to amphetamine (amphetamine itself originating as an innovative \\"upgrade\\" of an ephedrine prototypical base). Falk also asserted that the three varieties of ephedra that yield ephedrine (E. gerardiana, E. major procera and E. intermedia) also have the properties attributed to haoma by the texts of the Avesta. In 1994, Viktor Sarianidi claimed that ancient ritual objects found at BMAC archeological sites in Central Asia bore traces of Ephedra stalks and Papaver (poppy) seeds. In 1995, Harri Nyberg investigated the specimens provided by Sarianidi but could not confirm the claim. Another site provided material which Sarianidi had declared contained traces of Ephedra, Papaver, andCannabis (hemp) in 1998–1999. It was analysed in 2002–2003 by three independent teams, but they found no traces of the claimed contents. Nonetheless, in the conclusion of his observations on the 1999 haoma-soma workshop in Leiden, Jan E. M. Houben writes that \\"[d]espite strong attempts to do away with Ephedra by those who are eager to see *sauma as a hallucinogen, its status as a serious candidate for the Rigvedic soma and Avestan haoma still stands.\\" This supports Falk, who in his summary noted that \\"there is no need to look for a plant other than Ephedra, the one plant used to this day by the Parsis\\". =Nelumbo nucifera= Based on a detailed botanical analysis of iconography and ancient texts, Nelumbo nucifera, also known as the Sacred Lotus, is another candidate for some. The description of soma in the Vedic texts somewhat resembles the Sacred Lotus. Sacred Lotus is a waterlily that produces golden-red flowers on stalks. These flowers resemble portions of the ancient texts comparing soma to an arrow and the sun. Other Vedic hymns describe soma as having a \\"ruddy radiance\\", reflecting the color of the flowers of the Sacred Lotus. Soma is also described in the Vedic hymns as growing \\"joint by joint, knot by knot\\", which is a good description of a plant that grows by producing procumbent shoots with nodes and internodes. In addition, benzoisoquinoline alkaloids found in the Sacred Lotus, including aporphine, proaporphine, and nuciferine, are psychoactive, producing feelings of euphoria when ingested. =Ergot= Claviceps purpurea In The Road to Eleusis, the authors, R. Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann, and Carl A. P. Ruck, note the similarity in preparation of the Vedic soma and the Kykeon of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The book hypothesizes that the source of both was ergot (Claviceps purpurea). =Sugarcane= Several authors have identified Saccharum sara, a variety of sugarcane that grows near lakes as source of Vedic soma or with an ancient variety of sugarcane that may presently be extinct. =Account by Swami Rama= In his autobiography, Swami Rama recalls contacting an Indian herbologist and Vedic scholar named Vaidya Bhairavdutt, who is described as \\"the only living authority on soma\\". Bhairavdutt comes to visit the swami, bringing about a pound of the herb with him. He informs the swami that though the plant's effects can be likened to that of psychedelic mushrooms, it is definitely not a mushroom, but rather a succulent plant. Bhairavdutt convinces the swami to join him in partaking the soma. The taste, says Swami Rama, is \\"a little bit bitter and sour.\\" Bhairavdutt becomes inebriated and dances wildly, claiming he is Shiva. Several students attempt to restrain the apparently slightly built Bhairavdutt, but are unable to do so. Meanwhile, Swami Rama develops a crippling headache, a symptom which is compatible with the effects of ephedrine overdose. No hallucinogenic effects are described by Swami Rama. =Other, less-popular candidates= * Papaver somniferum * Argyreia nervosa * Periploca aphylla * Sarcostemma brevistigma * Sarcostemma viminale * Fermented milk from mare * Fermented honey * A mixture of these and other substances (e.g. Peganum Harmala and Phalaris aquatica) References Bibliography   * * Further reading * * Category:Entheogens Category:Herbal and fungal hallucinogens Category:History of Zoroastrianism Category:Cannabis and religion Category:Indo-Iranian peoples Category:Vedas ","title":"Botanical identity of soma–haoma"},{"id":"5655290","text":"Denis O'Beirne Faul (14 August 1932 - 21 June 2006), was an Irish Roman Catholic priest and civil rights campaigner best known for his role in the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike.

Irish Examiner \\"NI: Human rights campaigner Denis Faul dies \\" 21 June 2006 Irish hunger strike In 1981, as a visiting priest assisting the formally appointed chaplain, Faul played a decisive role in ending the hunger strike. In July 1981, he tried to persuade families of the hunger strikers that the campaign would not change the minds of Margaret Thatcher and her ministers and nothing could be gained by more deaths. The families spoke to the prisoners, resulting in two prisoners (Paddy Quinn and Pat McKeown) being moved to the hospital wings where they could be fed. By 6 September, four other participants had joined them and the remaining prisoners agreed to end their campaign on 3 October.BBC History \\"The Troubles - Hunger Strikes - Violence and Negotiations\\" The IRA referred to him as Dennis the Menace at this time.

The congregation called Oliver Willis Van Osdel to become its pastor in 1909. Van Osdel had pastored the church years before, but when the congregation refused to follow his lead and erect a new building, he had left for Spokane, Washington. Upon returning to Wealthy Street, Van Osdel led the church through the construction of the new building in 1912. He also made Wealthy Street into one of the capitals of the fundamentalist movement. Van Osdel was one of the founders of the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. The church was pastored for forty years by the Rev. Dr. David Otis Fuller, a King James Only movement proponent. It was the birthplace to Grand Rapids Baptist College, a predecessor to what is now called Cornerstone University, and served as its home from 1941 to 1964. The church moved to Michigan Street in the 1980s, purchasing a school building and adding on to it. In 2001, after struggling with declining membership, the church called Pastor Kenton Young. During his 14 years of ministry he and his wife renewed the heart of the church, stabilizing its membership, as well as shaping the congregation into a close family of believers. Pastor Young also saw to it that the church would be prepared for a smooth transition upon his retirement, hiring and mentoring an assistant pastor, William J.

He co-founded the ska punk band Less Than Jake in 1992, and was the band's drummer and lyricist until 2018. He also founded the record labels Fueled by Ramen, Sleep It Off Records, and Paper + Plastick, in addition to several local businesses in Gainesville, Florida. Biography Fiorello was born on June 24, 1974 in Rahway, New Jersey. He grew up in New Jersey but moved to Gainesville, Florida at age 16. Vinnie Fiorello and Chris DeMakes founded the band Less Than Jake while attending the University of Florida in 1992. Band members have told various media outlets different versions of the origin of the band's name. DeMakes has stated in interviews that the band's name came from Fiorello's family's pet parrot. His story claimed that the parrot would squawk during the band's practice sessions, leading to Fiorello's mother telling the band that they needed to stop playing because they were disturbing the bird. This would lead to the band referring to themselves as being \\"less than Jake.\\" In June 2020, however, Fiorello clarified that Jake was not a parrot but was, in fact, an English Bulldog. As the lyricist, Fiorello was generally regarded as the symbolic frontman for the band, despite being the drummer, and was usually the subject of any interviews with the band. In 1996, Fiorello co-founded the record label Fueled by Ramen with John Janick. He left the label in 2006. In the summer of 2015, Fiorello and his friend Eric Jazvac opened a tattoo parlor, Wunderland Custom Tattooing, in downtown Gainesville, Florida. On October 24, 2018, Fiorello announced that while he would remain a member of Less Than Jake, he would no longer be touring with the band. After Fiorello's announcement, the band recruited Teen Idols drummer Matt Yonker as their touring drummer. On September 1, 2019, Roger Lima announced via social media that despite prior reports, Fiorello was no longer with the band in any capacity and would not be participating in the creation of the band's upcoming album. In October 2019, High Times reported that Fiorello had founded a CBD brand called Sailor Diggen's Finest. Personal life Fiorello has a daughter, Liliana Rose, who was born on September 3, 2011.

Background The song, like many others on The Final Cut, is a rewritten version of a song rejected for The Wall, originally to be used in Spare Bricks (an early version of The Final Cut that was an extension of The Wall.) Guitarist David Gilmour objected to the use of these previously rejected tracks, as he believed that they weren't good enough for release: Despite not appearing on The Wall album, the lyrics of the chorus did appear in the film for said album, Pink Floyd – The Wall, where the lyrics were read by the main character, Pink, in-between the songs \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" and \\"Stop\\". \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" also appeared on a 12-inch promotional single entitled Selections from The Final Cut, with \\"The Final Cut\\" on the B-side. However, despite not being released as a commercial single, the song did receive significant radio play, resulting in the song hitting number 8 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart in America.

The genus commemorates Banff, Alberta, near where the first fossil specimens were discovered. Its placement in higher taxa is controversial. It is considered to be a member of the enigmatic phylum Vetulicolia.  Anatomy  Banffia constricta is known from hundreds of fossils found in the Burgess Shales. It is up to 10 cm in length, and divided equally into anterior and posterior parts. The entire body is twisted in a clockwise spiral, as seen from the front. This is believed to be a secondary adaptation from an initial bilateral condition for a burrowing lifestyle. The anterior section is covered by two carapace-like un-mineralized shells that are fused together. A crown-like structure formed of three concentric circular features surrounds the mouth. An antenna-form structure just posterior to the mouth may be a sensory organ. The posterior section is composed of 40 to 50 segments. The gut is straight, and the anus is at the terminal tip of the posterior section. The gut appears to have a series of diverticula or pouches. A possible circulatory system is visible in the fossils. B. constricta and its relative Skeemella were probably filter or deposit feeders.  Classification  There is no agreement on the classification of Banffia. B. constricta was assigned to the annelids by Walcott in 1911. As of 2006, different proposals would place Banffia in Vetulicolia, Arthropoda, or Urochordata. While the body plan (equal anterior and posterior sections with segmentation) resembles that of the Vetulicolians, it is argued that the absence of gills and an endostyle, and the presence of gut diverticula makes Banffia unlikely to be a member of the deuterostomes. However, an apparent complete lack of appendages (aside from the antenna-like structures) makes B. constricta's placement within Arthropoda equally unlikely. More recent finds of similarly shaped animals show structures thought to be a notochord, making Banffia and their relatives chordates, possibly the sister group to tunicates. The species Banffia confusa, known from fossils from the Chengjiang shales, was originally assigned to this genus, though, recent research shows that this species is not closely related to B. constricta, having been renamed as its junior synonym, Heteromorphus longicaudatus, and placed in a different class altogether, \\"Heteromorphida.\\" Later, Aldridge, et. al. resurrected B. confusa as Heteromorphus confusus, noting a variety of anatomical differences among the various specimens of Heteromorphus, suggesting that there may be more species recognized with more fossils discovered.

Ferdinand S. Fessenden, upon seeing the conditions of the school while on a walk in 1890, agreed to build a two-story building as well as provide desks and learning materials. Two years later, Fessenden deeded the school in 1892, under the auspices of the American Missionary Association of the Congregational Church. There is a memorial stone to F. S. Fessenden on the school grounds, and he is presumed to be buried under this memorial. The main building was built in 1909 with funding from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Joseph L. Wiley, principal of Fessenden, was responsible for securing the $6,500 grant. This funding, plus $1,500 raised in donations, built the main building that included the library, accommodations for female boarders, a dining hall and more classrooms.

In geological terms, the process of mineral hydration is known as retrograde alteration and is a process occurring in retrograde metamorphism. It commonly accompanies metasomatism and is often a feature of wall rock alteration around ore bodies. Hydration of minerals occurs generally in concert with hydrothermal circulation which may be driven by tectonic or igneous activity.  Processes  There are two main ways in which minerals hydrate. One is conversion of an oxide to a double hydroxide, as with the hydration of calcium oxide—CaO—to calcium hydroxide—Ca(OH)2, the other is with the incorporation of water molecules directly into the crystalline structure of a new mineral. The later process is exhibited in the hydration of feldspars to clay minerals, garnet to chlorite, or kyanite to muscovite. Mineral hydration is also a process in the regolith that results in conversion of silicate minerals into clay minerals. Some mineral structures, for example, montmorillonite, are capable of including a variable amount of water without significant change to the mineral structure. Hydration is the mechanism by which hydraulic binders such as Portland cement develop strength. A hydraulic binder is a material that can set and harden submerged in water by forming insoluble products in a hydration reaction. The term hydraulicity or hydraulic activity is indicative of the chemical affinity of the hydration reaction.

An antibody microarray (also known as antibody array) is a specific form of protein microarray. In this technology, a collection of capture antibodies are spotted and fixed on a solid surface such as glass, plastic, membrane, or silicon chip, and the interaction between the antibody and its target antigen is detected. Antibody microarrays are often used for detecting protein expression from various biofluids including serum, plasma and cell or tissue lysates. Antibody arrays may be used for both basic research and medical and diagnostic applications.  Background  The concept and methodology of antibody microarrays were first introduced by Tse Wen Chang in 1983 in a scientific publication and a series of patents,Chang, Tse W. \\"Matrix of antibody-coated spots for determination of antigens\\", Priority date February 2, 1983Chang, Tse W. \\"Immunoassay device enclosing matrixes of antibody spots for cell determinations\\", Priority date March 13, 1987Chang, Tse W. \\"Antibody matrix device and method for evaluating immune status\\", Priority date April 27, 1987 when he was working at Centocor in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Chang coined the term “antibody matrix” and discussed “array” arrangement of minute antibody spots on small glass or plastic surfaces. He demonstrated that a 10×10 (100 in total) and 20×20 (400 in total) grid of antibody spots could be placed on a 1×1 cm surface. He also estimated that if an antibody is coated at a 10 μg/mL concentration, which is optimal for most antibodies, 1 mg of antibody can make 2,000,000 dots of 0.25 mm diameter. Chang's invention focused on the employment of antibody microarrays for the detection and quantification of cells bearing certain surface antigens, such as CD antigens and HLA allotypic antigens, particulate antigens, such as viruses and bacteria, and soluble antigens. The principle of \\"one sample application, multiple determinations\\", assay configuration, and mechanics for placing absorbent dots described in the paper and patents should be generally applicable to different kinds of microarrays.

Chang were setting up Tanox, Inc. in Houston, Texas in 1986, they purchased the rights on the antibody matrix patents from Centocor as part of the technology base to build their new startup. Their first product in development was an assay, termed “immunosorbent cytometry”, which could be employed to monitor the immune status, i.e., the concentrations and ratios of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, in the blood of HIV-infected individuals. The theoretical background for protein microarray-based ligand binding assays was further developed by Roger Ekins and colleagues in the late 1980s. According to the model, antibody microarrays would not only permit simultaneous screening of an analyte panel, but would also be more sensitive and rapid than conventional screening methods. Interest in screening large protein sets only arose as a result of the achievements in genomics by DNA microarrays and the Human Genome Project. The first array approaches attempted to miniaturize biochemical and immunobiological assays usually performed in 96-well microtiter plates. While 96-well plate-based antibody arrays have high-throughput capability, the small surface area in each well limits the number of antibody spots and thus, the number of analytes detected. Other solid supports, such as glass slides and nitrocellulose membranes, were subsequently utilized to develop arrays which could accommodate larger panels of antibodies. Nitrocellulose membrane-based arrays are flexible, easy to handle, and have increased protein binding capacity, but are less amenable to high throughput or automated processing. Chemically derivatized glass slides allow for printing of sub-microliter sized antibody spots, reducing the array surface area without sacrificing spot density. This in turn reduces the volume of sample consumed. Glass slide-based arrays, owing to their smooth and rigid structure, can also be easily fitted to high-throughput liquid handling systems. Most antibody array systems employ 1 of 2 non-competitive methods of immunodetection: single-antibody (label- based) detection and 2-antibody (sandwich-based) detection. The latter method, in which analyte detection requires the binding of 2 distinct antibodies (a capture antibody and a reporter antibody, each binding to a unique epitope), confers greater specificity and lower background signal compared with label- based immunodetection (where only 1 capture antibody is used and detection is achieved by chemically labeling all proteins in the starting sample). Sandwich-based antibody arrays usually attain the highest specificity and sensitivity (ng – pg levels) of any array format; their reproducibility also enables quantitative analysis to be performed. Due to the difficulty of developing matched antibody pairs that are compatible with all other antibodies in the panel, small arrays often make use of a sandwich approach. Conversely, high-density arrays are easier to develop at a lower cost using the single antibody label-based approach. In this methodology, one set of specific antibodies is used and all the proteins in a sample are labelled directly by fluorescent dyes or haptens. Initial uses of antibody-based array systems included detecting IgGs and specific subclasses, analyzing antigens, screening recombinant antibodies,de Wildt, R. M., Mundy, C. R., Gorick, B. D., and Tomlinson, I. M. (2000) Antibody arrays for high-throughput screening of antibody-antigen interactions. Nature Biotechnol. 18, 989 –994 studying yeast protein kinases, analyzing autoimmune antibodies, and examining protein- protein interactions. The first approach to simultaneously detect multiple cytokines from physiological samples using antibody array technology was by Ruo-Pan Huang and colleagues in 2001.R.-P. Huang. (2001). Simultaneous detection of multiple proteins with an array-based enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 39:209-214. Their approach used Hybond ECL membranes to detect a small panel of 24 cytokines from cell culture conditioned media and patient's sera and was able to profile cytokine expression at physiological levels. Huang took this technology and started a new business, RayBiotech, Inc., the first to successfully commercialize a planar antibody array. In the last ten years, the sensitivity of the method was improved by an optimization of the surface chemistry as well as dedicated protocols for their chemical labeling. Currently, the sensitivity of antibody arrays is comparable to that of ELISA and antibody arrays are regularly used for profiling experiments on tissue samples, plasma or serum samples and many other sample types. One main focus in antibody array based profiling studies is biomarker discovery, specifically for cancer.Alhamdani, MS; Schröder, C; Hoheisel, JD (Jul 6, 2009). \\"Oncoproteomic profiling with antibody microarrays\\". Genome medicine 1 (7): 68 For cancer-related research, the development and application of an antibody array comprising 810 different cancer-related antibodies was reported in 2010. Also in 2010, an antibody array comprising 507 cytokines, chemokines, adipokines, growth factors, angiogenic factors, proteases, soluble receptors, soluble adhesion molecules, and other proteins was used to screen the serum of ovarian cancer patients and healthy individuals and found a significant difference in protein expression between normal and cancer samples. More recently, antibody arrays have helped determine specific allergy-related serum proteins whose levels are associated with glioma and can reduce the risk years before diagnosis. Protein profiling with antibody arrays have also proven successful in areas other than cancer research, specifically in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's. A number of studies have attempted to identify biomarker panels that can distinguish Alzheimer's patients, and many have used antibody arrays in this process. Jaeger and colleagues measured nearly 600 circulatory proteins to discover biological pathways and networks affected in Alzheimer's and explored the positive and negative relationships of the levels of those individual proteins and networks with the cognitive performance of Alzheimer's patients. Currently the largest commercially available sandwich- based antibody array detects 1000 different proteins.RayBiotech, Inc. Antibody Arrays. (2017). Retrieved from the RayBiotech, Inc. website http://www.raybiotech.com/antibody-array.html In addition, antibody microarray based protein profiling services are available analyzing protein abundance and protein phosphorylation or ubiquitinylation status of 1030 proteins in parallel. Antibody arrays are often used for detecting protein expression from many sample types, but also in those with various preparations. Jiang and colleagues illustrated nicely the correlation between array protein expression in two different blood preparations: serum and dried blood spots. These different blood sample preparations were analyzed using three antibody array platforms: sandwich-based, quantitative, and label-based, and a strong correlation in protein expression was found, suggesting that dried blood spots, which are a more convenient, safe, and inexpensive means of obtaining blood especially in non-hospitalized public health areas, can be used effectively with antibody array analysis for biomarker discovery, protein profiling, and disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Applications Using antibody microarray in different medical diagnostic areas has attracted researchers attention. Digital bioassay is an example of such research domains. In this technology, an array of microwells on a glass/polymer chip are seeded with magnetic beads (coated with fluorescent tagged antibodies), subjected to targeted antigens and then characterised by a microscope through counting fluorescing wells. A cost-effective fabrication platform (using OSTE polymers) for such microwell arrays has been recently demonstrated and the bio-assay model system has been successfully characterised. Furthermore, immunoassays on thiol-ene \\"synthetic paper\\" micropillar scaffolds have shown to generate a superior fluorescence signal.

The first three games in the franchise were developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis in the early 1990s, and have since been ported and re-released on various platforms. A fourth entry, Streets of Rage 4, was released in 2020. The games were well-received and have been re- released many times both on compilations and as standalone games. The electronic dance music soundtracks of the games, scored by Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima, have also received much acclaim. History =Original trilogy= Three games in the series were released between 1991 and 1994. The first entry, Streets of Rage, introduces the four main characters, three young former police officers known as Axel, Blaze, and Adam, and Mr. X, an evil mastermind. It is the only game in the series to feature a Shinobi-style special attack that defeats all non-boss enemies on-screen. Streets of Rage was supported by Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System and Game Gear consoles. The next entry in the series, Streets of Rage 2, had new music (influenced by early '90s club music) from series composer Yuzo Koshiro and newcomer composer Motohiro Kawashima, more defined graphics and a larger selection of moves. It also introduced two new characters, Eddie \\"Skate\\" Hunter, and Max Thunder (or Sammy \\"Skate\\" Hunter and Max Hatchett in some regions). Like the original title, Streets of Rage 2 was playable on Sega's Genesis, Master System, and Game Gear. The third entry to the Streets of Rage series, Streets of Rage 3, was less well-received than its predecessors. Despite some enhancements, it has been seen as very similar to Streets of Rage 2. This entry to the series added a more complex storyline told using cutscenes. The Western version featured increased difficulty, with other elements altered or censored from the Japanese release. The music, again composed by Koshiro and Kawashima, was also criticized for being radically different from the music from the first two games. Unlike the two foregoing games, Streets of Rage 3 was available only on the Genesis. =Series hiatus= Although it was one of the most popular Sega franchises in the 1990s, no new official Streets of Rage games were released for over 25 years after Streets of Rage 3, excluding rereleases of the first three games via various Sega game compilations. Sega is reported to have attempted to bring the series to the Saturn, and early in the production cycle for Sega's Dreamcast a demo tentatively titled Streets of Rage 4 was made by Ancient. It showed a character similar to Axel fighting a group of enemies. Neither the Saturn nor the Dreamcast game, however, came to fruition. Backbone Entertainment later pitched a new Streets of Rage game to Sega, but this project also failed to proceed. There have been numerous unofficial fan-made projects and remakes, including Beats of Rage and Streets of Rage Remake. =Revival= The first new entry in the series since the Genesis, Streets of Rage 4, was announced in 2018 and released in 2020. The game was developed by Lizardcube, Guard Crush Games, and Dotemu, who previously released the 2017 remake of Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap. A spin-off minigame based on the Yakuza series, Streets of Kamurocho, was released as part of Sega's 60th anniversary celebration. It was developed by Empty Clip Studios and was only available on Windows via Steam from October 17-19, 2020. Other media =Comics= Three six-part comic strip series based upon the games appeared in Sonic the Comic in the early 1990s (along with several other adaptations of popular Sega franchises). The first two of these were written by Mark Millar, while the third (and a Poster Mag story) was written by Nigel Kitching. These three stories are an alternate continuity from the games and do not feature Adam. A graphic novel compilation of the original four-part \\"Streets of Rage\\" strip was released as a book titled Streets of Rage: Bad City Fighters in the UK in 1994. The first story, entitled simply Streets of Rage, involved Axel, Blaze, and Max quitting the highly corrupt police force in order to do more good as vigilantes, taking down Max's ex-partner; the crime lord and martial artist Hawk. The next serial, Skates' Story, introduced Skates, delinquent stepson of Murphy, a friend of Axel and his team and one of the few honest cops left on the force, who was unwillingly drawn into joining Axel's group after his stepfather was killed by Mr. X. The third and final story, The Only Game In Town, involved the Syndicate unleashing an army of street gangs. The Poster Mag story The Facts of Life features Axel, Blaze, Skate, and Max. =Music= The game's soundtrack was acclaimed, with several soundtrack albums being released. The soundtracks were composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Another musician, Motohiro Kawashima, helped on the second, providing a few tracks, and making almost half of the tracks for the third. Three soundtrack CDs were released in all, each of which now sell for high prices at auction and in Japanese markets. The soundtracks mainly consist of, often experimental, chiptune-based electronic dance music, encompassing electronic genres such as electro, house, techno, hardcore, jungle, ambient, breakbeat, gabber, noise, and trance. The music was produced using the Yamaha FM-synth sound chips of the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis video game console (YM2612) and NEC PC-88 computer (YM2608), along with Koshiro's own audio programming language \\"Music Love,\\" a modified version of the PC-88's Music Macro Language (MML). Reprinted from The soundtracks have been critically acclaimed. They are considered ahead of their time, and as some of the best video game music of all time. Streets of Rage 2 (1992) in particular is considered revolutionary for its \\"blend of swaggering house synths,\\" \\"dirty\\" electro-funk and \\"trancey electronic textures that would feel as comfortable in a nightclub as a video game.\\" Streets of Rage 3 is also considered ahead of its time, for its automatically generated randomized sequences, experimental hardcore \\"fast-beat techno like jungle\\" sounds, and trance music elements. The series' soundtracks have influenced a range of chiptune, electronica, grime and dubstep musicians through to the present day, including artists such as Ikonika, BT, Labrinth, Martyn, Joker, Darkstar, Childish Gambino, and Danger. =Novella= A Streets of Rage 2 novella (published together with a Street Fighter II novella) was written by Mat Yeo in 1993. It is just 35 pages long, based on the second game in the series, and was given away free with copies of Sega Force magazine in the UK. = Film and television adaptations = A feature film and television series produced by Stories International (a joint venture between Sega and Hakuhodo DY Group) are in the works alongside other adaptations such as of Altered Beast. The film and show is to be co-produced by Circle of Confusion with his production partners Lawrence Matthis and Julian Rosenberg at alongside Tomoya Suzuki.

Life  Klatzkin was born in Byaroza-Kartuskaya, a son of the local Rabbi Eliyahu Klatzkin. He received his early schooling from his father and yeshivas in Lithuania. Later he traveled to Germany to study with philosopher Hermann Cohen. Klatzkin received his doctorate from the University of Berne in Switzerland, then returned to Germany to write for Hebrew periodicals and establish Jewish publishing firms. He also served as director of the Jewish National Fund in Cologne. He wrote widely on the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza and compiled 10 of 15 anticipated volumes of the German Encyclopaedia Judaica with Nahum Goldmann. Klatzkin had a close relationship with Arnold Schoenberg, a Jewish musician who was also active in advancing the need to establish a place of refuge for the Jews in the 1930s. After the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, Klatzkin fled to Switzerland and earned a living giving lectures on various Jewish subjects. He moved to the United States in 1941 and continued to teach in Chicago at the College of Jewish Studies. He returned to Switzerland in 1947 and died there at the age of 66.  Beliefs  He rejected the notion of chosenness for the Jewish people, either religious or secular. He argued that the only meaningful goal for Zionism was regaining the land of Israel and normalizing the conditions of Jewish existence. He believed that assimilationists were \\"traitors to their Judaism\\".Ludwig Lewisohn (2007) Rebirth – A Book of Modern Jewish Thought READ BOOKS, p 170 He criticized Ahad Ha-Am for the notion that morality was the key to Israel's uniqueness. He believed that ethics are universal, not the possession of a particular people. He maintained that the spiritual definition of Judaism denied freedom of thought and led to national chauvinism. Klatzkin proposed a Jewish covenant that is based on secular- nationalist terms. Here, the Jewish state does not pursue any messianic or colonialist mission and instead a territorial Zionism that is normal, national state and culture. Klatzkin also developed an alternative to the Freudian view of life, which holds that it can only be understood from within. This involved his theory of the mind, which emphasizes the so-called rift between life and the spirit or the living or the original, unmediated soul and the spirit. The conflict, according to Klatzkin, is the reason why man live in constant alienation from the world.  Literary works  * Otzar Munahim ha'Philosophim (Philosophy Terms), 4 vols.

The character made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 11 August 2000. The character was originally played by Claude Stevens. McNamara was cast in the role when the character was reintroduced in 2001. Gino owned a hair salon called A Good Hair Day, which employed both Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) and Janelle Timmins (Nell Feeney). Script producer Luke Devenish called Gino \\"a [gay] stereotype\\" and a comedic character, similar to Mr. Humphries from British sitcom Are You Being Served?. Character development In 1995, Neighbours introduced a storyline about the bullying of gay teacher, Andrew Watson (Christopher Uhlman). It was a turning point for the show, but it took another five years before another gay male character was introduced. Gino made his first appearance in 2000. He was a hairdresser who owned the local hair salon and spoke about his flatmate Aaron often. It was later revealed that Aaron was his partner. Neighbours script producer, Luke Devenish said of the character, \\"He is a [gay] stereotype, and we don't have a problem with that as he is not a negative stereotype, he is a comic character and it is for a laugh – in the Mr Humphries [of Are You Being Served] kind of tradition\\". David Knox of TV Tonight called Gino an \\"incidental gay male character.\\" When Gino moves in with Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), the writers decided to tweak the \\"standard love triangle story\\" with Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) becoming jealous of the duo. Harold and Gino get along very well and share a love of musicals. Of this, Peter Mattessi of The Age said \\"The tension this created between Lou and Harold (\\"same-sex platonic life-partners\\", according to Toadie) was a wonderful storytelling twist, and the innuendo made Gino's sexuality clear to those in the know, yet avoided the questions from younger viewers which would jeopardise the G rating.\\" Storylines Gino was born Ray Murphy, but he decided to change his name when he became a hairdresser. Gino formed a reputation as a top hairdresser and he decided to open his own hair salon. He bought the A Good Hair Day salon in the Lassiter's Complex in 2001, which concerned Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha), who had been managing it for the previous owner. Gino and Lyn were rivals and Lyn began dressing younger as she knew that Gino favoured young, pretty hair stylists. Gino put Lyn on a month's trial to see if she could juggle her family and her commitments to the salon. Lyn quit after Gino started taking her regular clients away from her. Lyn decides to branch out on her own and take Gino's clients with her. When Gino finds out about her plans, he threatens to blacken Lyn's name around the town. Lyn tells Gino that she knows his real name is Ray Murphy. Gino is shocked and does not want his reputation ruined, so he accepts Lyn's resignation. Gino's business suffers without Lyn and he tells her that he made a mistake in mistreating her. Lyn then agrees to come back. Gino becomes involved in the Erinsborough Amateur Players and asks Joe Scully (Shane Connor) to build him some sets. Both men clash with their different ideas, but eventually come to respect each other. Gino also becomes a wedding planner and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) asks him for his help with her second wedding to Karl (Alan Fletcher). Gino's plans are too much for Susan and Karl and when they go to reject them, Gino tells them that his commitments to the Erinsborough Players' mean he cannot commit to the planning the wedding. When Gino falls out with his boyfriend, Aaron (Stewart Adam), Gino discovers that Harold Bishop has a room to rent. Gino and Harold bond over their love of musicals and vegetarian food and Harold invites Gino to move in. Gino later makes up with Aaron and moves back in with him. However, Gino arrives back at Harold's within a few hours of leaving as he and Aaron had fallen out again. Harold tries to get rid of Gino and when he cooks much meat and eats a sausage, although it was vegetarian, in front of him, Gino leaves and goes back to Aaron. Gino asks Joe if he could be godfather to his and Lyn's son, Oscar (Ingo Dammer-Smith). Gino explains that he will never have kids of his own and his nieces and nephews live too far away. Joe agrees to give it some thought. On the day of Oscar's christening, Joe discovers that Gino has decorated the church and he asks him to be Oscar's fourth godparent. Gino comes between Harold and Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) when he and Lou start spending a lot of time together. Harold becomes jealous when Gino and Lou and two girls from the salon go away together and Gino and Lou begin partying with each other. However, both Lou and Harold support Gino when Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) accuses Gino of trying to come onto him. Gino is left shaken by the incident. He eventually put the incident behind him when Boyd apologises. Gino writes a play about a country boy who arrives in the city dreaming of stardom and he casts Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor) in the lead role. On the morning of the opening night, Gino injures his back and Karl takes over his duties. Karl also fills in for Ned, after he injures his knee. Following the opening night, no more tickets were sold and Gino's play finished. A few weeks later, Gino announces that he is going to take his baby paegents on tour around Australia and he sells the salon to Steve Parker (Steve Bastoni). Reception The Sydney Star Observer said that \\"at times, Gino has also shown astonishing depth. Like when he was fighting to become godfather to Lyn's baby son Oscar\\". They said that the situation was something \\"a lot of gay men can relate to\\" as Gino explained that he was unlikely to have a child of his own. The newspaper added \\"We went beyond the froth with him and it was quite moving\\". Of the character of Gino and his relationship with Harold Bishop, David Knox said \\"Gino eventually ended up sharing house with Harold, frequently watching musicals on DVD together but never speaking about the love that dare not speak its name...\\" References Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional gay males Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Television characters introduced in 2000 Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Gino Esposito"},{"id":"5655492","text":"Neuhausen may refer to: *Neuhausen am Rheinfall, a town in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland *Neuhausen railway station, a railway station in Switzerland *Neuhausen Rheinfall railway station, a railway station in Switzerland *Neuhausen Badischer Bahnhof, a railway station in Switzerland *Neuhausen auf den Fildern, a municipality in Baden-Württemberg, Germany *Neuhausen (Enz), a municipality in Baden-Württemberg, Germany *Neuhausen ob Eck, a municipality in Baden-Württemberg, Germany *Neuhausen/Spree, a municipality in Brandenburg, Germany *Neuhausen, Saxony, a municipality in the district of Freiberg in Saxony, Germany *Neuhausen, a borough of Worms, Germany *Neuhausen, a city in East Prussia, today Guryevsk, Kaliningrad Oblast *Danish name for the SIG Sauer P210 *Vastseliina Castle See also * Neuhaus (disambiguation) * Neuhausen-Nymphenburg, a borough of Munich, Germany ","title":"Neuhausen"},{"id":"5655513","text":"Cuckney Hill lies between the village of Cuckney and the town of Market Warsop, in Nottinghamshire, East Midlands, England.

Bruney in his rookie year with the Diamondbacks posted a 4.31 ERA and struck out 34 batters in 31.1 innings. In 2005, the Diamondbacks tried Bruney as their closer, and he saved 12 games in 16 opportunities. Overall, the 2005 season turned out to be a poor showing for Bruney. He posted a 7.43 ERA in 46 innings. In May 2006, Bruney was designated for assignment by the Diamondbacks. He was later signed as a minor league free agent by the New York Yankees. =New York Yankees= Bruney with the Yankees in 2007. Bruney pitched for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers until being recalled by the Yankees. Armed with an upper-90s fastball, mid-80s curveball and an aggressive approach, Bruney quickly established himself as one of the better relief pitchers in the Yankees' bullpen. Bruney finished with a 1-1 record and a 0.87 ERA in 19 games (20.2 innings). In , he spent time on both the Yankees' major league roster and their Triple-A team. He ended the season with a 4.68 ERA in 58 major league games. Bruney reported to spring training 2008 having lost 20 pounds in the offseason, in addition to gaining speed on his fastball. On April 25, 2008, it was learned that Bruney would likely miss the remainder of the season due to a fracture in his foot (Lisfranc) but he chose to forgo foot surgery in order to rehab the injury. After spending time rehabbing in the minors, he returned to the Yankees on August 1 following the trade of Kyle Farnsworth. He was slated to be Mariano Rivera's primary setup man going into the 2009 season. In , Bruney spent part of the season on the disabled list with a 3.92 ERA and 1.51 WHIP in 39 innings pitched. On June 13, 2009, Bruney criticized New York Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez, calling his antics on the mound \\"unbelievable\\" and saying that Rodriguez has \\"got a tired act.\\" Rodríguez responded after the Mets won that day's game by saying \\"somebody like that, it doesn't bother me,\\" and suggesting that Bruney \\"better keep his mouth shut and do his job, not worry about somebody else.

It is manufactured by Acheson Industries, a subsidiary of ICI. The name is a shortened form of \\"Aqueous Deflocculated Acheson Graphite\\", but has become a generic term for conductive graphite coatings used in vacuum tubes. Other related products include Oildag, Electrodag and Molydag. Deflocculation refers to the distribution of powdered high purity graphite in an aqueous solution containing approximately 2% to 10% by weight of various Tannic/Gallotannic acid variants and separating the colloidal graphite suspension from the remaining unsuspended graphite particulates. The product names are often printed with DAG in upper case (e.g. AquaDAG). It is used as an electrically conductive coating on insulating surfaces, and as a lubricant. Properties Aquadag consists of a dispersion of colloidal graphite in distilled water. It is provided in concentrated paste form and is usually diluted with distilled water to a desired consistency before application. It can be applied by brushing, swabbing, spraying, or dipping, after which the surface is dried, leaving a layer of pure graphite. After drying the coating is electrically conductive. Its resistance and other electrical properties vary with degree of dilution and application method. When diluted 1:1 and applied by brush its resistance is: :Air-dried ~800 ohms per square :Heated to 200 °C ~500 ohms per square :Heated to 300 °C ~20–30 ohms per square Use in cathode ray tubes A conductive aquadag coating applied to the inside of the glass envelope of cathode ray tubes, serves as a high-voltage electrode. The coating covers the inside walls of the \\"bell\\" of the CRT tube, from just inside the neck, and stops just short of the screen. Due to the graphite, it is electrically conductive and forms part of the high- voltage positive electrode, the second anode, which accelerates the electron beam. The second anode is a metal cylinder inside the neck of the tube, connected to a high positive voltage of 18 to 25 kilovolts. It has spring clips, which press against the walls of the tube, making contact with the aquadag coating so it also carries this high positive voltage. The electron beam from the electron gun in the neck of the tube is accelerated by the high voltage on the anode and passes through it to strike the screen. The aquadag coating has two functions: it maintains a uniform electric field inside the tube near the screen, so the electron beam remains collimated and is not distorted by external fields, and it collects the electrons after they have hit the screen, serving as the return path for the cathode current. When the electron beam hits the screen, in addition to causing the fluorescent phosphor coating to give off light, it also knocks other electrons out of the surface. These secondary electrons are attracted to the high positive voltage of the coating and return through it to the anode power supply. Without the coating a negative space charge would develop near the screen, deflecting the electron beam. A typical value of beam current collected by the anode coating is 0.6 mA. In some CRTs the aquadag coating performs a third function, as a filter capacitor for the high-voltage anode supply. A second conductive coating is applied to part of the outside of the tube facing the inside coating. This outside coating is connected to the ground side of the anode supply, thus the full anode voltage is applied between the coatings. The sandwich of the two coatings separated by the dielectric glass wall of the tube form a final capacitor to filter out ripple from the anode supply. Although the capacitance is small, around 500 pF, due to the low anode current it is sufficient to act as a filter capacitor. In the television tube manufacturing industry, the manufacturing step that applies the aquadag is called \\"dagging\\". Other uses Aside from its use in the production of CRTs, Aquadag is used in many types of high-voltage lab apparatus where a conductive coating is needed on an insulating surface. The surfaces of some metals (most notably aluminum) can develop nonconductive oxide layers, which tend to disrupt the electrostatic field produced around the surface of the metal when used as an electrode. Aquadag is not subject to such effects and provides a completely uniform equipotential surface for electrostatics. Producers of continuous filament fiberglass will coat their product with Agadag when a conductive property is required. Other dags There are also deflocculated graphite products dispersed in liquids other than water. Acheson has extended the use of the dag brandname to non-graphite products e.g. the copper-based Electrodag 437 conductive paint.

After demanding they hand over a bag of cash, which it appears they were reluctant to do, the man shot both of them fatally. Empty handed, the murderer then made his escape from the building, through an exit and down a fire escape, as other members of the cinema staff came to the men's aid. Investigation Liverpool City Police launched a huge manhunt for the killer, which turned up few leads until some months later when they received a letter from a pair of convicted criminals, a prostitute and her pimp. Jacqueline Dickson and James Northam were prepared to assist the police with information on the murders in return for immunity from prosecution themselves. This resulted in the arrests of two Liverpool men, Charles Connolly, 26 and George Kelly, 27. Kelly had convictions for petty theft whilst Connolly had been in trouble for brawling. Despite their protestations that they had never met before and both being able to produce sound alibis for the evening of 19 March, the pair were charged with the murder of the two men in the cinema. First trial They stood trial at Liverpool Assizes in the city's St Georges Hall on 12 January 1950 before Mr. Justice Roland Oliver. The prosecution's case was that Kelly had been the gunman and that Connolly had acted as lookout as well as having planned the robbery. =Northam's evidence= In his evidence, Northam alleged that he and Dickson had been present in the Bee Hive public house in Mount Pleasant with the defendants when they were plotting the crime; had seen Kelly loading a pistol; and that Kelly had borrowed his (Northam's) overcoat for use as a disguise during the robbery. Dickson stated that Kelly had borrowed a dark scarf or apron to use as a mask; trying it on in front of the customers of the crowded pub before he and Connolly boarded a tram to take them to the Edge Hill area. No other witnesses to this action were ever found. Northam claimed he had originally planned to assist in the robbery but the sight of the gun had frightened him off. =Graham's evidence= Much was made of the evidence of Robert Graham, a Preston criminal serving a sentence in Walton Prison at the same time that Kelly and Connolly were on remand there, who claimed to have carried messages between the prisoners as they sat in adjacent cells, which would have been unnecessary as the cells, which had barred doors rather than solid ones, were near enough that the men could converse freely. He also alleged that both Kelly and Connolly had separately confessed their part in the murders to him in the exercise yard, which both men denied. Graham was later rewarded for his evidence with a reduction in his sentence. Kelly had spent almost the whole day and early evening of the murder drinking heavily and many witnesses came forward to confirm the fact that he was clearly half drunk as the day wore on. The cinema staff however, were quite certain the man who threatened them outside the manager's office before sprinting out of the building and away up a side street, so quickly they could not keep up with him, was not somebody who had been drinking. Forensic examination of the crime scene and the angle of the bullet wounds in the victims' bodies indicated that the person who fired the shots had held the gun in his left hand. The cinema fireman, who witnessed the gunman leaving through the fire exit, noted that he kept his left hand, presumably holding his gun, in his pocket. Kelly was right-handed. After what was then one of the longest murder trials in British legal history, the jury failed to reach a verdict and a retrial was ordered, this time with the defendants tried separately. =Where was Charles Connolly = Much was made of the question of where Charles Connolly had been at the time of the shooting as it was said that his role was that of lookout. However, he was not seen near the cinema and the sequence of events tended to preclude him having played any role as look out as he neither warned George Kelly of John Catterall's arrival at the managers office nor appeared to have been standing ready at the emergency exit which the gunman clearly had trouble opening. This led to the question of how the gunman entered the cinema, the conclusion being that he must have either gone through the auditorium of from the main entrance, or that there had been an accomplice who had opened the emergency exit from the inside in advance. =The mystery of the cut telephone wires = The telephone wires at the Cameo Cinema had been cut at the foot of the spiral staircase and the police were called by a local resident although they arrived quickly. However, no explanation was put forward for who cut them and when. The issue of the cut wires is further complicated when considering the evidence of Northam, Dickson and Graham, none of whom detailed the issue in the planning. In particular, if the robbery had been planned in the Beehive Hotel earlier in the evening then it might have been reasonable to consider that the conversation would have addressed the need or intention to cut the phone wires and whether anyone had a tool that they could be cut with. Nor is the cutting of the telephone wires detailed in Northam's subsequent conversation in the following days with George Kelly when he allegedly explained what happened. The ommission of this fact that only the murderer would have known and which was either not reported in the newspapers or only reported in the most extensive coverage, being a significant part of the robbery that would have taken time, of which there were only a few minutes from start to finish, undermines the veracity of Northam, Dickson and Graham's subsequent accounts of George Kelly's alleged confessions. =2 February 1949 Cameo Cinema break in = Little is made of the break in at the Cameo Cinema on 2 February 1949 for which three youths were arrested and charged on 2 April 1949. During the break in they had gone into the manager's office, where Leonard Thomas and John Catterall were later shot and tried forcing cupboards. They took cigarettes, chocolate and 10s, worth in total about £5, but would no doubt have familiarised themselves with the office layout and seen the safe. Whilst there is nothing connecting them with the murder, where was nothing connecting Charles Connolly or George Kelly with the murder either other than false statements and circumstantial behaviour. The significance of the 2 February 1949 break in was that it suggests that the Cameo Cinema was a target with local youths and criminals for easy pickings and that there could have been any number of other people with an interest in the venue with regards to robbing it after word spread about the lay out and discussion was had about how they handled their money. Re-trial Kelly was tried first and, despite a spirited defence by Rose Heilbron KC, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. The judge was Justice Cassels. Connolly was then offered the chance to plead guilty to conspiracy and being an accessory. Faced with the almost certainty that he would otherwise be convicted of murder and share the fate of his co-accused if he refused, he had little choice other than to accept the offer and plead accordingly. Contrary to popular belief, Connolly did not turn King's Evidence but simply pleaded guilty to the charges laid before him. His plea however, destroyed Kelly's assertions of his own innocence and despite an appeal against his conviction, Kelly was executed at Walton Prison, Liverpool by Albert Pierrepoint and his assistant Harry Allen on 28 March 1950. He continued to assert his innocence, even on the scaffold. Connolly was released from prison in 1957 and died in 1997. Shortly before his death, he took part in an interview on BBC Radio Merseyside, during which he reaffirmed both his and Kelly's innocence. =Justice Cassels= Justice Cassels was the judge at the second trial. After the convictions were handed down he commended Northam and Dickson and awarded them £30 each for their selfless role in the case and recommended that Graham be similarly have a good word given although he could not reward him directly under his powers. Justice Cassels said 'but for their evidence, George Kelly and Charles Connolly, two dangerous criminals might never had been brought to justice. Whatever their previous faults might have been, they, by their actions in the case, and at the risk to their personal safety, had rendered a service to the community'. Dickson, who was already a convicted prostitute, went on two years later to be convicted for violently robbing her clients and was sentenced to a number of years imprisonment. Northam had a large number of convictions. Controversy The case caused considerable disquiet in legal circles for many years and there were a number of attempts to have it re-opened. The evidence put forward by the prosecution had emanated from witnesses who could hardly be described as being of sterling character. Dickson was a convicted prostitute and thief who, two years after the Cameo trial, was sentenced with others to a lengthy prison term for the violent robberies of a number of her clients. Northam had been a criminal since the age of 14 and had spent much of the 1940s in and out of prison. Graham shared a similar background. All three stood to gain by their testimony. The detective who led the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Herbert Balmer, had difficulty in corroborating much of the prosecution evidence during the trial and many prosecution witness statements bore the sign of police coaching. Employer's timesheets, which detailed Connolly's movements on the day of the murder, had been amateurishly tampered with. Witness statements that favoured the accused men were held back by the police, a fact later discovered by a local businessman, Luigi Santangeli, who set out to investigate the crime on behalf of Connolly in the 1990s and was given access to the case files by Merseyside Police. =Donald Johnson= Most importantly, scant attention was paid to the fact that another Liverpool criminal, Donald Johnson, had demonstrated an intimate knowledge of the crime after being arrested for a street robbery in Birkenhead and had been charged with complicity in the murders prior to the arrests of Kelly and Connolly. Johnson had been transferred to Walton Prison from Birkenhead, where he allegedly admitted to another prisoner that he had been involved in the cinema shootings. This other prisoner was Robert Graham, the same witness who would later tell the court that Connolly and Kelly had confessed to being the murderers. During questioning, Johnson admitted being in the vicinity of the cinema at the time of the murders and had been stopped by a police constable, suspicious of his loitering, who had demanded to see his identity card and then taken his name. Johnson, during police interrogation, referred to the murder weapon as being an automatic, a fact which the police had not made known to the public. He further stated that one of the dead men had been shot whilst on his hands and knees, another fact which had been held back by the police. Johnson also told police that he knew the identity of the gunman, but had taken a religious oath not to reveal his name. Because Johnson's entire statement was ruled inadmissible, after the presiding judge decided that the police had obtained it by threats and inducement, an attempt to try him as an accessory failed and he was freed. Liverpool City Police were then left in the position of having lost their most likely suspect - who could not be even questioned about the case again. Given the magnitude of the crime, reputations and careers would no doubt have been in jeopardy and the investigation team were in desperate need of fresh suspects. Donald Johnson later claimed that he had lied about what he knew of the shooting in the hope that he could get the police to dismiss his Birkenhead offence. Confessing to even peripheral involvement in a brutal double murder however, simply to have a mere mugging charge dismissed, would seem an unlikely course of action for an experienced criminal like Johnson to take and he clearly had a detailed knowledge of what had occurred in the cinema office. There has been speculation in the years since that a close relative of Johnson's may have been the gunman and that was the reason he refused to name him to the police. Johnson died in 1988. Eventually the case reached the Court of Appeal in February 2001 and in June 2003 Kelly's and Connolly's convictions were judged to be unsafe and were duly quashed. Kelly's remains were taken from their burial place in Walton prison by his family and he was given a dignified funeral after a service in Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. Related case Two years after the execution, Chief Superintendent Balmer was investigating the murder of Beatrice Rimmer in Cranborne Road, just a few hundred yards from the Cameo cinema. He was again claiming that two young men, this time from Manchester, Alfred Burns and Edward Devlin, were responsible for the crime. Their convictions were clearly shown to be unsafe in a book, Murderers Or Martyrs (Waterside Press 2013), again by George Skelly, with a damning foreword by former UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith QC. Indeed, the author demonstrated in detail how Balmer may have framed the two men in an identical scenario to that used by him to frame Kelly and Connolly two years earlier. The possibility that Balmer did frame the two men is more tenuous than in the Cameo case and probably explains why Skelly's submission to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, involving new argument and eleven bundles of previously undisclosed evidence, was rejected.

History Ligerz church and vineyards on the slopes of the Jura Mountains. The Tessenberg funicular. Built in 1911-12 Ligerz is first mentioned in 1236 as Ligerce. The shore of Lake Biel was inhabited during the neolithic period. A neolithic shoreline settlement has been discovered near the municipal border close to the village of Schafis, which is part of the La Neuveville municipality. Other traces of prehistoric settlements include scattered Bronze Age and Roman era artifacts. During the Middle Ages Ligerz was ruled by the Lords of Ligerz, who held it as a fief for the Counts of Nidau. Their castle, the Festi, first appeared in historical records in 1236. In 1358, the Herrschaft of Ligerz was divided between two lines of the ruling family. At the end of the 14th century, the lands were pledged to the city of Biel to secure a loan. Between 1388 and 1393, Bern acquired the sovereignty over the land of the Counts of Nidau including Ligerz village and the surrounding lands. However, Bern did not own either half of the land of Ligerz. The two halves were sold to the von Büren and von Muleren families, both Bernese patrician families. In 1409 one half of the Herrschaft was sold to the city of Biel, while the other half was sold in Bern in 1469. Finally in 1551, Biel sold the other half of Ligerz to Bern. In 1553 Bern reaffirmed the old market and fishing rights that the village had received from earlier rulers. The pilgrimage church of Ligerz was first mentioned in 1261. It was built in the vineyards above the village and was originally a filial church of the parish of Diesse. It became a parish church of its own parish in 1434, but was still dependent on Diesse until the Ligerz church was rebuilt in 1520-26. Between 1876 and 1889, it was part of the Twann parish. The slopes of the Jura Mountains above the village were covered with vineyards by the Middle Ages. The vineyards were owned by a variety of towns and monasteries including Biel, Bern, Erlach Abbey, Fraubrunnen Abbey and Thorberg Abbey. Over the following centuries, patricians from Bern and Biel bought the vineyards. During the 17th and 18th centuries these patrician families built elegant townhouses in the village, which they would visit during harvest. Until the 18th century the village had a French speaking majority and the village school was bilingual (French/German) until the end of that century. Today the official language in Ligerz is German. Following the 1798 French invasion, Ligerz became part of the District of Zealand. The 1803 Act of Mediation placed it in the Nidau district. Until the early 19th century there were no good roads into Ligerz, instead goods and travelers came by boat. In 1835-38 the Biel Road connected Ligerz and the other communities along the lake shore with the city of Biel. The Biel-Neuchâtel railroad, which was built in 1858-60, connected Ligerz to rest of the country. In 1911-12 the Ligerz- Tessenberg funicular was built, allowing travel into the mountains. Due to the limited flat land in Ligerz, a tunnel was built in 1984-91 to route the motorway near the municipality while preserving the appearance of the village. Today the major industries in Ligerz include wine making, tourism and fishing. Geography Ligerz from across Lake Biel Aerial view (1954) Ligerz has an area of .

It was a popular convention of Italian and French opera in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Mad scenes were often created as a way to offer star singers a chance to show off their abilities, though many of them are also very dramatic. The vocal writing is often exciting and highly demanding, requiring immense skill. Most mad scenes were composed for the soprano voice, but there are examples for the baritone and the tenor. They are most popularly associated with works of the bel canto period, though examples may also be found in earlier works, such as George Frederick Handel's Orlando and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Idomeneo. Almost all mad scenes were composed for either opere serie or opere semiserie; Gaetano Donizetti was probably the most famous exponent of the form. The convention of writing mad scenes largely died out after the bel canto era, as composers sought to inject more realism into their operas. More recently, some composers have returned to the form for dramatic effect, most notably Benjamin Britten in the final act of Peter Grimes. Similar mad scene techniques have also appeared in ballets, such as Giselle. The modern musical theatre has also been influenced by the operatic mad scene, as evidenced in Sweeney Todd and Sunset Boulevard.

The airport covers and has three runways, one public and two private helipads. The runways are 28 Right/10 Left-28 Left/10 Right parallels and 5/23. History First known as Gibbs Field, the airport opened in July 1940 as an all-way clay and gravel surface airfield. It was founded by William Gibbs (1910–2016). In 1950, the airport was renamed Montgomery Field in honor of John Joseph Montgomery, an aviation pioneer who in 1884–1886 made the first manned, controlled, heavier-than-air flights in the United States from Otay Mesa south of San Diego starting with a glider designed in 1883. Montgomery-Gibbs assumed its current name in 2016 to recognize both of the airport's previous namesakes. =World War II= During World War II, control of the airport was assumed by the United States Army Air Forces, which built three hard runways. It was called \\"Gibbs Auxiliary Field\\" and used as a support airfield for the contractor pilot school at Ryan Field, near Hemet. It also supported training activities at the United States Army Desert Training Center (DTC) in the Mojave Desert, and later as an auxiliary airfield for Lindbergh Field in San Diego. It was used presumably as an overflow airfield to store newly manufactured B-24 Liberator bombers and PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft made by Consolidated Aircraft. Following the war, the airport returned to civil control. Modern usage Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport is one of the busiest airports in the U.S. for small aircraft and has a number of flying clubs, flight schools, plus business turboprops and jets based there. The San Diego Fire Department bases aircraft there. King Schools, Inc. is based nearby and its aircraft are based at the airport. Since summer 2009, King Schools (in conjunction with Cessna) has been flight-testing the prototype Cessna 162 Skycatcher Light-Sport Aircraft at or around the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has maintained an air traffic control tower at the airport since 1965. It is on the north side of the airport, just east of Taxiway C and Runway 23/5, and the normal hours are 0600-2100 local time. Accidents and incidents * On September 25, 1978, a Cessna 172 registered as N7711G took off from Montgomery Field and proceeded to Lindbergh Field to do a practice instrument landing (ILS) approach.

Ludovico II Gonzaga (1334 – 4 October 1382) was an Italian politician who was capitano del popolo of Mantua. He was a member of the House of Gonzaga. Biography He was the son of Guido Gonzaga and Beatrix of Bar. Together with his brother Francesco, he set a plot against his elder brother Ugolino, who had also been associated with power by their father, killing him on 14 October 1362 during a dinner. Despite the suspicions, Guido pardoned his sons. In 1368 Francesco also died in mysterious circumstances, and Ludovico became the only successor to Guido. When his father died, Ludovico set a policy of friendship with the nearby Milan and their rulers, the House of Visconti. He married Alda, daughter of Obizzo III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. Their son Francesco was married to Agnese, daughter of Bernabò Visconti. He also established trade links with the Republic of Venice. Internally, Ludovico built or strengthened fortifications in his land, but also faced two plots, including one by Antonio Gonzaga in 1373. Ludovico died in 1382, and was buried in the church of San Francesco.

Its name comes from the Slavic lesnice, meaning “forest place”.  Geography  Lößnitz is a small town in the western part of the Ore Mountains lying nestled among wooded mountain ranges in a glen, roughly 432 m above sea level. It lies 4 km northeast of Aue and 27 km southwest of Chemnitz. = Constituent communities = Lößnitz has six Ortsteile (constituent communities), namely Affalter (since 1999), Dittersdorf (since 1973), Grüna (from 1974 a constituent community of Affalter), Dreihansen (said to have been a self-standing community in 1791), Niederlößnitz (since 1898) and Streitwald (from 1939 a constituent community of Affalter).  History  Lößnitz was founded by the Castle Counts (Burggrafen) at Meißen in 1170, and in a document from 1284 it was already described as a Civitas. The town's first documentary mention, however, had already come in 1238, in which it was named as “Lesnitz the forest place”. Lößnitz's early history is somewhat speculative. A schoolmaster is mentioned as being in the town in 1304, for instance, leading to the inference that the Lößnitz Latin school was already there then. Likewise, the first known mayor Hermann von Buten appears in the town's history in 1372, leading to further speculation that there must have been a town hall by that time. In 1382, Lößnitz was designated a Bergstadt and a year later the whole town burnt right down as far as the town mill that stood before the gates. In 1406, the Count of Schönburg acquired the County of Hartenstein and made Lößnitz its seat. In 1542, the Reformation was introduced. In 1601, the town hall portal appeared and the town hall remodelling was finished six years later. However, all of it was lost, along with the church, the parish building, the school and moreover 108 houses, in the “Rote Ruhr” (“Red Dysentery”, a name given this town fire). In the years that followed, the town also had to deal with sackings, the plague and yet another town fire. In 1714, the Baroque Hospitalkirche (“Hospital Church”) was consecrated. Town fires were nothing unusual in those days, and on 10 December 1806 it once again came to pass and among the buildings lost were, again, the town hall, the parish building and the school as well as the mediaeval St. Johanniskirche (church), the brewing and malting house, 182 houses and 16 barns. The town sprang back from this, but only three years later, there was yet another fire, this one started by a lightning strike. Of the 104 houses that were destroyed, 26 were ones that had already been rebuilt after burning down in the last fire. On 29 October 1826 the new church, Haupt- und Stadtkirche St. Johannis, was consecrated. There were later further fires in Lößnitz, whereby the Baroque Hospitalkirche was destroyed, too. After jurisdiction over the town had been relinquished to the House of Schönburg, the Fürstlich Schönburgische Justizamt Stein (“Princely Schönburg Justice Office of Stein”) came into being in 1861, and that same year, the new Hospitalkirche was consecrated. When the Schönburg principalities were taken over by the Kingdom of Saxony in 1878, Lößnitz was given a Kingdom of Saxony Amt court, which persisted until 1931. In 1917, the bells at both the St. Johanniskirche and the Hospitalkirche were removed for war requirements, but only three years later, the former acquired three new bells. In 1939, a carillon consisting of 23 bronze bells was installed in the church's spire. On 20 April 1945, the town's deputy mayor Rudolf Weber, who wanted to surrender the town to the Americans without a fight, was shot by the Waffen-SS. Between 1985 and 1992 there arose on the edge of town a great residential area, where today almost half the town's population lives. In 1999 came the amalgamation of the community of Affalter. = Population development = The following population figures refer to 31 December of each given year. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\"  1982 to 1988 * 1982 − 8876 * 1983 − 8780 * 1984 − 8724 * 1985 − 8648 * 1986 − 8500 * 1987 − 8484 * 1988 − 10205  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\"  1989 to 1995 * 1989 − 11620 * 1990 − 12270 * 1991 − 12951 * 1992 − 13098 * 1993 − 13056 * 1994 − 12801 * 1995 − 12555  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\"  1996 to 2002 * 1996 − 12302 * 1997 − 12041 * 1998 − 11760 * 1999 − 11527 * 2000 − 11262 * 2001 − 11068 * 2002 − 10769  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"25%\\"  2003 to 2006 * 2003 − 10601 * 2004 − 10479 * 2005 − 10374 * 2006 − 10184 } : Source: Statistisches Landesamt des Freistaates Sachsen = Niederlößnitz = Today's constituent community of Niederlößnitz (“Lower Lößnitz”) was originally a farming village downstream from where the Aubach empties into the Lößnitzbach. The first known naming of the community goes back to 1497, when it was known as Niderlesenitzs. About 100 years later, the community counted 6 landowners. One estate was exempted from combat duty and served as the lordly hunting lodge. A. Schuhmann mentioned in 1820 in his Lexikon two flour mills and a paper mill. However, the paper mill, which had supposedly once been a hammerworks and a coin blank works, burnt down in 1808 and was never rebuilt. Towards the end of the 19th century, the railway line between Zwönitz and Aue, on which the lower railway station was built somewhat later, came into service. After the station was built came residential areas and industrial development, leading eventually to Niederlößnitz's amalgamation with the Town of Lößnitz in 1898.  Politics  = Coat of arms = Lößnitz's arms show a black Saint Andrew's cross (the arms of the Castle Counts at Meißen, the town's founders) on a yellow background. The cross is surrounded by three towers set on a stylized wall on a red background. The wall and towers refer to the town's former formidable fortifications; the three towers symbolize the three former town gates. = Town partnership = Since 1991 there has been a partnership with the Westphalian town of Borgholzhausen.

It was to “proclaim the thankfulness that the German people owe their Führer and his movement”.Apoldaer Tageblatt 25.5.1939 The St. Johanniskirche is the largest neo-classical church in the oremountains.Website of the local lutheran congregation: http://www.kirche-loessnitz.de = Folk festivals and markets = * Weekly market every Thursday * Dorffest Draffaller (village festival) * Lößnitzer Salzmarkt (salt market, third weekend in June) * Naturmarkt (in September) * Christmas Market (Advent)  Economy and infrastructure  = Economy = Lößnitz was over the centuries a regionally important economic centre with market rights. With widespread industrialization beginning about the year 1850, Lößnitz became one of the most important industrial centres in the western Ore Mountains. Important businesses were in shoemaking, machine building, textile refining and processing and metalware. Slate mining around the town was also important for a long while. German Reunification brought far-reaching changes in the region leading to the loss of a great deal of the local industry. = Transport = The Bundesstraße 169 runs through the municipal area. The nearest Autobahn interchanges, with Bundesautobahn 72, are in Hartenstein and Stollberg. Lößnitz lies on the railway line between Chemnitz and Aue (Zwönitztalbahn) and has two railway stations, called oberer Bahnhof and unterer Bahnhof – upper and lower stations. Trains are run by the Erzgebirgsbahn, a daughter operation of Deutsche Bahn AG. For local transport – in the case of buslines that serve Lößnitz – the fare structure of the Verkehrsverbund Mittelsachsen (“Middle Saxony Transport Association”) applies.

Even larger is G. steinheimense, known from a complete 37-year-old male found in Mühldorf, Germany, which is tall and weighed . It had four tusks, two on the upper jaw and two on the elongated lower jaw. The lower tusks are parallel and shaped like a shovel and were probably used for digging up food from mud. Unlike modern elephants, the upper tusks were covered by a layer of enamel. Compared to elephants, the skull was more elongated and low, indicating that the animal had a short trunk, rather like a tapir's. These animals probably lived in swamps or near lakes, using their tusks to dig or scrape up aquatic vegetation. In comparison to earlier proboscids, Gomphotherium had far fewer molars; the remaining ones had high ridges to expand their grinding surfaces. Gomphotherium spp. inhabited dry wooded regions near lakes.

The facility was used primarily as a place to temporarily harbor inmates awaiting transfer to longer term facilities, such as the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Security included a single chain-link fence about 20 feet high with razor wire, cameras, and guards. Guards were divided into three sections, composed of United States Navy and United States Marine Corps personnel in ranks from E-1 to E-6/7. In addition to security personnel, the Brig had a small administration staff including medical personnel and civilian cooks who worked with inmates to prepare meals.

The terms of a trade are not finalized until a later date, most often following the conclusion of the season. Postponing a trade's final conditions or terms is often done for several reasons. First, the team receiving the PTBNL might not be certain which position they want to fill, so this type of deal gives them more time to figure it out. Second, this type of arrangement gives the team receiving the PTBNL more time to evaluate the available talent on the other team. Also, when a trade takes place during August, a player must clear waivers before he can be traded; the PTBNL concept allows the player's original team to make an attempt to have him clear waivers then finalize the deal, or (if the player cannot clear waivers) wait until the end of the season to trade him. When a PTBNL transaction occurs, the negotiating teams usually agree on a list of five to ten players that the PTBNL will ultimately be chosen from. The deal must close within six months of the conclusion of the rest of the trade. If the teams can't agree on who the player will be, then they will agree on a price to be paid instead of a player. It is possible that a player could end up being traded for himself, as has happened four times in MLB history. The PTBNL is generally a minor league player or a journeyman major leaguer. Very few PTBNLs are of known star quality at the time of the trade; however, some minor league PTBNLs have gone on to be productive in the majors, including Michael Brantley,https://www.cleveland.com/tribe/2014/07/the_cleveland_indians_were_for.html Jeremy Bonderman,http://archive.littleleague.org/media/llnewsarchive/2007stories/07poy.htm Scott Podsednik,https://jaysjournal.com/2013/08/16/and-the-return-for-emilio- bonifacio-is/ Coco Crisp,https://waitingfornextyear.com/2015/07/cleveland- indians-trade-deadline-ptbnl/ Marco Scutaro,https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2018/7/30/17623486/mlb-trade-deadline- player-to-be-named-later-all-stars Moisés Alou,https://www.mlb.com/cut4/best- players-to-be-named-later-in-mlb-history/c-288046920 Jason Schmidt,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/786418-mlb-trades-david-ortiz-and- the-best-players-to-be-named-later Gio González,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/786418-mlb-trades-david-ortiz- and-the-best-players-to-be-named-later#slide10 David Ortiz,https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/on-this-date-20-years-ago-david- ortiz-was-a-player-to-be-named-later-in-a-trade/ and Trea Turner. Notable PTBNLs =Players traded for themselves= Four players in MLB history were traded for a PTBNL, then subsequently traded back to their original teams, thus being players that were traded for themselves: *Harry Chiti was traded to the 1962 New York Mets from the Cleveland Indians for a PTBNL. However, the teams could not agree on a final deal, so the Mets traded Chiti back to Cleveland. *Brad Gulden was traded from the New York Yankees to the Seattle Mariners in 1980 for a PTBNL, then in May 1981 Seattle traded him back to the Yankees. *In 1987 Dickie Noles was traded from the Chicago Cubs to the Detroit Tigers for a PTBNL. As with Chiti, the teams could not agree on a final deal, and Noles was traded back to the Cubs. *On July 22, 2005, John McDonald was traded from the Toronto Blue Jays to the Detroit Tigers for a PTBNL. McDonald was subsequently re-acquired by Toronto on November 10, 2005, in a cash transaction completing the trade. =Dave Winfield and the 1994 strike= Dave Winfield, a Baseball Hall of Famer, near the end of his career, was included in a PTBNL trade complicated by the 1994 strike. While a member of the Minnesota Twins, Winfield was traded on August 31, 1994 to the Cleveland Indians for a PTBNL. Under the terms and conditions of the trade, if Winfield appeared in 16 or more games with the Indians, the Twins would receive a Class AA-level PTBNL, but if he played between one and 15 games the PTBNL would be Class A-level. However, the strike led to the season eventually being canceled with no further games played. To settle the trade, Cleveland paid Minnesota a token sum of $100, and the Indians' general manager took the Twins' general manager out to dinner and picked up the dinner tab (official sources list the transaction as Winfield having been sold by the Twins to the Indians). In popular culture In the movie Bull Durham, Kevin Costner's character Crash Davis introduces himself to his new manager as \\"I'm the player to be named later.\\" In other sports In the National Hockey League, future considerations work in a similar fashion to PTBNLs, except that heavily conditional draft picks are usually traded instead of cash, because the NHL allows teams to trade draft picks, but not to trade players or draft picks for cash. In the National Basketball Association, the equivalent is a top-55 protected second round pick (there are only 60 picks in the NBA draft, so this is the maximum allowable protection) or the rights to a player, usually playing for an overseas team, whom the team drafted some time ago but does not intend to sign to an NBA contract. The team trading the player also receives a trade exception, or salary credit to be utilized in a future trade, worth the guaranteed salary of the player.

Organization Midwest Book Review was established in 1976. The Editor-in-Chief of the organization is James A. Cox. The review puts out nine publications on a monthly basis, with a focus on community and academic library organizations, booksellers, and the general reading public. The organization maintains a website at www.midwestbookreview.com. Publications produced by the organization include: The Bookwatch, California Bookwatch, The Children's Bookwatch, Internet Bookwatch, Library Bookwatch, MBR Bookwatch, The Midwest Bookwatch, The Reviewer's Bookwatch, Small Press Bookwatch, and The Wisconsin Bookwatch. The Children's Bookwatch is a newsletter made as a resource for librarians. Some reviews from Reviewer's Bookwatch are provided in greater depth at the organization's website. Midwest Book Review is made up of volunteers, and frequently seeks additional individuals to serve as book reviewers for the organization. The organization is located in Oregon, Wisconsin. It has a motivation of increasing literacy, public utilization of libraries, and fostering small press, to which it gives priority. Of the 1,500 books submitted to Midwest Book Review for consideration per month, the organization chooses to review approximately 450 of them. A visitor to the website Amazon.com emailed Cox in 2006 and asked about the organization's practice of giving all reviews posted to the site a five-star recommendation. Cox replied explaining that he disagreed with the star-rating system in general, and noted, \\"If a book isn't good enough to pass our initial screening then it doesn't get reviewed in the first place.\\" In 2007, an author asked Cox about the organization's position with regard to Amazon.com ratings. Cox explained, \\"for a book to make it all the way through the Midwest Book Review process. ... it merited the highest recommendation available under the Amazon rating system. Inferior books, flawed books, substandard books are assumed to have been weeded out and never made it to the 'finish line' of publication in one of our book review magazines.\\" In a 2001 interview with The Denver Post, Cox stated that Midwest Book Review considers submissions from print on demand (POD) publications. \\"When 1st Books, iUniverse and other POD titles cross my desk, I make sure to look at them, not out of regard for these publishers - but out of regard for the authors,\\" said Cox. Cox does not believe that book reviewers should be fee-based, and said, \\"Any reviewer that wants money from you for any purpose whatsoever is operating a scam, engaging in unethical behavior that is in violation of the publishing industry etiquette norm.\\" In 2008, Midwest Book Review had gained reviewers as a result of cutbacks in print media publications. Cox noted, \\"The drastic cutbacks in newspaper and magazine space for reviews has redounded to the benefit of the Midwest Book Review and other online review sites. These displaced reviewers have turned to us as an outlet for their reviews previously published in print sources. Over the past few years we have gained at least ten reviewers this way.\\" After stating that charging fees is a scam, Cox began charging a reading fee in 2011. However, those fees are sent directly from the author to their assigned reviewer. Mr. Cox, nor does any of his MBR employees/volunteers, collect any fees for themselves. Initially fees were only charged for e-books, but since then has expanded to include any \\"ebooks, pre-publication manuscripts, galleys, uncorrected proofs, ARCs, and pdf files\\". Reception Every review produced by Midwest Book Review is indexed to the review index maintained by Gale Research.

It was built in the 14th century, probably by Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester or his son- in-law, Ralph, Earl of Stafford, with the purpose of managing the crossing of the River Usk. The castle was used as administrative offices for the collection of rent and dues from local tenants, and was also a residence and a garrison. In 1402 it was sacked by Owain Glyndŵr. It was in disrepair by 1522, and was taken by Oliver Cromwell's forces during the Civil War. Its use declined further in later centuries. It has been a Grade II* Listed building since 1951. Location The castle is in the city of Newport between the Newport Bridge and the neighbouring railway bridge, on the west bank of the River Usk. It is adjacent to the B4591 (A4042), at the Old Green interchange. Description Newport Castle from the east bank. Note the watergate in the centre tower. The castle was built of Old Red Sandstone and local grey limestone. Originally, it was surrounded by a moat, within a \\"rectangular walled court\\". Trett said that \\"in its heyday it would have dominated the town and the river crossing.\\" It had three tall towers, a large rectangular central tower and two two-storey polygonal end towers, which connected by straight walls. Its form is based upon the line of the river bank on which it is located. A vaulted audience chamber sat above a watergate -- \\"a fortified gate... for use of people and supplies arriving by boat\\". Above the watergate were turrets. Within the castle were a great hall, kitchen, a gallery, chambers and, after the 15th century works by Humphrey Stafford, \\"a series of luxurious\\" apartments, those used by the lord being in the south tower. Architectural historian John Newman states that the most remarkable feature is the T-shaped room in the central tower above the watergate, which \\"must have provided a remarkable ceremonial setting.\\" Images of the castle are found in a town map of 1750. A plan of the castle itself was published in Archaeologia Cambrensis in 1885. Newman has a detailed description of the architecture, and a plan. The castle site included land between Newport Station and the river. Construction projects, including a railway, railway bridge and a later inner ring road, resulted in modifications to the site, including destruction of \\"most of the inner bailey\\" and the removal of the moat. The courtyard no longer remains, and at its height, the castle was a \\"river oriented\\" castle with no special fortification on the roadside portion of the walled court. Now, only the east side of the castle remains. History =The first castle= The first castle at \\"Castell Newyd ar Uysc\\" (New Castle on the River Usk) -- so named to distinguish it from the old Roman port upstream at Caerleon -- was a Norman motte possibly built by William Rufus around 1075. Its exact location is uncertain, but a common theory is that it was built at Stow Hill close to St Woolos Church, about southwest of the later castle. In 1910, James Matthews, author of Historic Newport, wrote that the first mention of a castle in Newport was in 1126. William, Earl of Gloucester had a garrison established at the castle in 1171, but the following year the castle was destroyed by Iorwerth. According to Trett, \\"It is recorded in the Welsh Brut y Tywysogion that in about 1172 King Henry II visited Castell Newyd ar Uysc (New Castle on the River Usk). In 1185 the king’s accounts show that six pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence were spent on repairs to the castle of Novi Burgi (i.e. Newport) and its buildings and bridge.\\" The castle was restored in 1249 by Henry III, and it was held in 1265 by the Earl of Leicester. That same year, Prince Edward occupied the castle, and in 1295, when he was the king, he ordered improvements and repairs. It was ceded to Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester in 1320 and two years later Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March attacked the castle, took its furnishings and set it on fire. Three hundred trees were needed for reconstruction. The scanty remains of the Norman castle were probably buried by spoil from a railway tunnel dug in 1846. =14th and 15th centuries= Ground plan of Newport Castle, showing the portions surviving in 1858. From Archaeologia Cambrensis, 1885 The second castle at Newport, commonly known as Newport Castle, was built in the 14th century, possibly by Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester, after de Audley took control of Despenser's lands in 1326, or, more probably, by his son-in-law and successor Ralph, Earl of Stafford. Historians, such as Jeremy Knight, believe it was built between 1327 and 1386. A coin made during Edward III's reign (1327-1377) was found during an 1845 excavation of the site. It had an \\"imposing position\\" above the river and controlled the river crossing and trade upstream. At that time Newport became the centre of the lordship of Wentlooge. The castle was first documented in 1405, when it was repaired after being sacked in 1402 in the rebellion by Owain Glyndŵr. Around 1435 further work was undertaken by Humphrey Stafford, Lord of Newport. Owen Tudor was held prisoner within the castle in 1460. It was primarily the lordship's administrative centre, an adjunct to their main estate for collecting local tenants' dues and rent. It was rarely used as the lord's residence. =16th to 19th centuries= It was occupied in the early 16th century by Henry VIII's uncle, Jasper Tudor. Seized by Henry VIII in 1521, the castle was held by the king until 1547 when it was then possessed by Edward VI. It had suffered from lack of upkeep from 1522, at which date it was already reported to be in disrepair. William Herbert of St. Julian leased the castle starting in 1548. In 1645, during the Civil War, Colonel Henry Herbert established a garrison of 50 troops at the castle, which was taken by Oliver Cromwell's forces in 1648. The Herbert and Morgan families held it over a 300-year period that began in 1548. It was in a state of ruin by 1743. In the 19th century, the buildings within the ruin were used as a tannery and later as a brewery. The hall's traceried windows were destroyed in that century, and the brewery was destroyed by a fire in 1883. In 1891, the south tower came into the ownership of the Corporation, and the rest of the castle was bought by Lord Tredegar in 1899. The Office of Works became the guardian of the castle between 1930 and 1950, at which time there was a refurbishment of the stonework. Trains pass near to the castle on the railway bridge crossing the River Usk =20th and 21st centuries= The east side is the only part of the castle to survive. It has been a Grade II* Listed building since 1951. An inner ring road was built alongside the castle in 1970.

History Mühleberg Nuclear Power Plant Mühleberg is first mentioned in 1011–16 as Mulinberg. There are several Hallstatt era grave mounds around Mühleberg; the most important is the so- called Unghürhubel (monster hill). At Unghürhubel in 1869, an ornamented choker made of heavy gold plate and a gold bracelet or strip with four rows with half-moon shapes were discovered. A number of other less valuable artifacts and metal items were probably destroyed during the excavation. The church and village of Mühleberg belonged to a cadet branch of the von Buch family starting in 1387. It was then owned by the Brüggler family (starting in 1440) and the Herren family (in 1579), who sold it to Bern in 1599. It was combined with several other small estates and placed under the bailiwick of Laupen. St. Martin's Church was first mentioned in 1224, though it was originally a romanesque aisleless church from the 11th century. The church tower was from the 12th century. It was expanded in 1523–24 with a new choir and became the parish church of a large parish. After the Protestant Reformation, the parish included Frauenkappelen. The hydroelectric plant was built in 1917–21, which created Lake Wohlen. The Mühleberg Nuclear Power Plant was built in 1967–71. Both plants provide power to Bern. Following the Chernobyl disaster, public opinion swung against the power plant. In 1992, a public referendum in the canton of Bern rejected granting an unlimited operating license to the power plant, with 51% voting against.. In German. In 2003, 68% of the population rejected the initiative named Strom ohne Atom, that proposed that the plant should be shut down in 2005 to be replaced by non-nuclear power generation. A similar proposal at cantonal level had already been rejected in 2000 by 64% of voters. In German. The two power plants remain the largest employers in the municipality. =Gümmenen= Gümmenen was the site of a medieval castle and village on the banks of the Saane river. It was first mentioned in 1252 as Guminun and in 1259 it was called, in Latin, Contamina or Condamina. Gümmenen Castle, of which nothing remains, was built by either the Counts of Burgundy or the Dukes of Zähringen as part of the defenses along the Saane, along with Laupen Castle and Grasburg Castle. The castle was built to defend a bridge over the river. By 1391, a village (villa inferiori Dicti castri) had developed around the bridge. In 1259, Peter of Savoy made Gümmenen into an imperial fief and imperial castellans took over the castle and village. In 1282–83 King Rudolph I of Germany forced the Savoy castellan out and granted it to a Habsburg knight, Ulrich II of Maggenberg as a fief. Ulrich's heirs sold the castle, ferry and ford to Fribourg in 1319. Fribourg then granted the lands to the knights of Vuippens, who lost it back to either the Holy Roman Empire or Fribourg in 1325. The castle and village were besieged and destroyed in 1333 during Bern and Fribourg's first war over the Sense and Saane valleys, the Gümmenenkrieg. The peace treaty brokered in 1333 by Queen Agnes returned Gümmenen to Fribourg. Fribourg granted Gümmenen to one of their citizens, but in 1389, Bern acquired the usufruct right to Gümmenen. Then, during the 1447–48 Freiburg War Bern established a Bernese court in Gümmenen. Bern received the rights to the village in the peace treaty that ended the war. Around 1450, they built the first wooden bridge over the river. In 1454, Bern gave the village back to Fribourg, but in 1467 the Bern- Fribourg border was fixed on the right bank of the Saane river and Gümmenen was assigned back to Bern. The current old village was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. The current wooden bridge was built in 1732–39. The village developed as a small border crossing. It had two taverns, a forge and a customs and guard house at the wooden bridge. It remained a customs and guard station until 1853, when internal tolls were abolished in the new Swiss federal state.

Cookingham or L. Perry Cookingham, (October 23, 1896 - July 22, 1992) was a noted public administrator in the United States having served as City Manager of Kansas City, Missouri for 19 years. Early life Cookingham was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Danville, Illinois. He served in the U.S. Army during World War I and received a civil engineering degree from the Detroit Institute of Technology. He worked in the public-works department of Flint, Michigan, where he met his wife Harriette West. In 1926, he was the first city manager of Clawson, Michigan. In 1931, he was named city manager of Plymouth, Michigan and subsequently became the director of the work division of the Federal Emergency Relief Association in Wayne County, Michigan. Cookingham served as the first City Manager of Saginaw, Michigan, after that city adopted a new city charter providing for the council-manager form of government in 1935. He served in this post from January 6, 1936 until May 14, 1940. During this time he was also president of the International City/County Management Association. City Manager of Kansas City Kansas City had switched to the city manager form of government in the 1926, ostensibly to improve efficiency. However, big city boss Tom Pendergast was to install a puppet city manager as the first city manager, in the form of Henry F. McElroy. The Pendergast/McElroy combine was to usher in a glory era in which much of the city infrastructure, including Kansas City City Hall, Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City), Nelson Art Gallery, was built and Kansas City Jazz was to thrive during a period of lax to non-existent enforcement of liquor laws. However, the era was also marked by patronage jobs and no-bid contracts, all covered up by McElroy's \\"country bookkeeping.\\" The era ended in 1940 with Pendergast pleading guilty to income tax evasion. McElroy had died shortly after leaving office in 1939. Following the city election of 1940, a new city council hired Cookingham to reform Kansas City’s administration. He took office on June 10, 1940. Cookingham entered office with the city $20 million in debt. Within six months, he had trimmed the payroll by 2,000 and within a year and a half he had eliminated the city's debt. He was to oversee a period when Kansas City through annexations more than doubled in area from 60 to —- mostly north of the Missouri River. The Great Flood of 1951 destroyed much of Kansas City's industrial base —- devastating the Kansas City Stockyards and destroying major facilities belonging to the city's two home-based airlines -- Mid-Continent Airlines and TWA. Cookingham oversaw the construction of a brand new jet port north of the Missouri River, which would become Kansas City International Airport, including the construction of a city-owned overhaul base that was leased back to TWA to repair its worldwide fleet of planes. Cookingham Road, the main road into the airport, is named for him. The freeway system in the Kansas City metropolitan area is credited in large part to Cookingham’s planning. In 1959, the City Council forced Cookingham to resign. Within the next four years, Kansas City had nine city managers. Post Kansas City After leaving Kansas City, Cookingham was city manager of Fort Worth, Texas for four years. After which, he retired and returned to Kansas City where he administered the People to People Program and served as a consultant to Kansas City architect firm HNTB. The University of Missouri–Kansas City conferred upon him the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters on May 12, 1979 and later named the L.P. Cookingham Institute of Urban Affairs at the Henry W. Bloch School of Management, UMKC after him. In 1986, the City of Saginaw invited Cookingham to participate in celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the council-manager city charter in recognition of his contributions made to that city in which he was also highly regarded. During the occasion, a time capsule was buried near the entrance to Saginaw’s City Hall scheduled to be opened in 2036. Cookingham died on July 22, 1992, in Kansas City, at the age of 95. He was buried at Forest Hill-Calvary Cemetery in Kansas City. References *Dictionary of Missouri Biography - Edited by Lawrence O. Christensen, William E. Foley, Gary R. Kremer, and Kennith H.

The tusks were possibly defense weapons, not unlike elephants of today.The Free Dictionary: TusksUpali.ch Elephants in Zoo and Circus, Teeth, second dentition, tusks. The molars were not composed of lamellae like those of true elephants, but had cusps, like tapir and pig molars; Anancus appears to have lived in forests, eating from trees and shrubs and digging out tubers and roots in the forest floor, and it died out when these forests gave way to grasslands. Stable carbon isotopes from Ethiopian Anancus tooth enamel 3–4 million years ago suggest that it grazed on C4 plants.

The main operations of the Corporation were to collect rents on these lands, receive petitions, answer inquiries and settle all disputes arising from the clergy land. History The Corporation began as a body in 1818, when it was established by the Upper Canada Executive Council. It was officially commissioned by Lieutenant Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland in 1819. Its origin stemmed from a strict interpretation of the Constitutional Act of 1791 by the Family Compact, led by John Strachan, to keep the clergy reserves for the Church of England. The new Corporation had twelve members: the Bishop of Quebec, who acted as chair, both the Inspector and Surveyors General, the Rectors of York, Kingston, Niagara, Grimsby, Cornwall, Ancaster, Hamilton and Newcastle, and two other members of the Anglican clergy. The Corporation directed the local sheriffs to collect the various rents. The first meeting of the Corporation was held at York on 25 March 1820. Stephen Heward, who was Auditor General of Land Patents, was appointed Secretary Receiver of the Corporation. Five years later the Executive Council ordered that the Corporation should cease making any new leases of the reserves, as it had been thought that the land would be sold to the Canada Company. This option was championed by Egerton Ryerson, who was upset at the state of the reserves and wanted them to be available to the Methodists. In August 1828 Heward, the Secretary Receiver, died and was succeeded by George Herchmer Markland. The issuance of new leases resumed in April 1829. However this only continued until 1832, when the Lieutenant Governor advised the Corporation to discontinue the issuance of leases after a bill was passed to combine the clergy reserves with Crown land. At this point, Markland was appointed Inspector General and a new Secretary Receiver, Thomas Baines, was appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in 1833. With no new leases being issued, the actions of the Corporation were confined to overseeing former leases, which had not yet become very lucrative. Baines undertook a plan to change this and appointed Clerks of the Peace as District Commissioners to undertake a survey of each individual lot in Upper Canada. The result of this was a huge increase in lease revenues, but the full amount of rent was still unattained. In view of this and increased pressure against the idea of Anglican clergy lands held by the Family Compact, the Executive Council decided in 1838 to dissolve the Corporation and to transfer Baines into the Crown Lands Department, where he would continue to oversee the collection of payments in arrears on clergy reserve leases and oversee the sale of Crown land in Upper Canada. At this point both the Clergy Corporation and the Clergy Reserves were largely dissolved; the lands were officially secularized in 1854. References Wilson, Alan. (1968).

Summary In the foreword, Caputo makes clear that this is not a history book, nor is it a historical accusation; it is a story about war, based on his experience. The first section \\"The Splendid Little War\\", describes Lieutenant Philip Caputo's reasons for joining the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the training that followed and his arrival in Vietnam. Lt. Caputo was a member of the 9th Expeditionary Brigade of the USMC, the first American regular troops unit sent to take part in the Vietnam War. He arrived on March 8, 1965 and his early experiences reminded him of the colonial wars portrayed by Rudyard Kipling. The 9th Expeditionary Brigade was deployed to Da Nang (formerly Tourane) on a \\"merely defensive\\" condition, primarily to set a perimeter around an airstrip that ensured arrival and departure of military goods and personnel. The first skirmishes against the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong made it clear to Lt. Caputo and his comrades that their earlier impression about Vietnam war as small and unimportant were all wrong. In the second part of the book, \\"The Officer in Charge of the Dead\\", Lt. Caputo is reassigned from his rifle company to a desk job documenting casualties. His new position in the Joint Staff of the brigade was a change that did not suit him, because he was proud of his rifle company duties and had a certain desire to return to basic infantry command. This distance from the Main Line of Resistance gave Lt. Caputo a different perspective of the conflict. Lt. Caputo described senior officers as being more worried about trivial matters than strategy, movies being played in the open at night, risking potentially devastating mortar attacks. Lt. Caputo also witnessed enemy corpses being treasured as hunting trophies and shown off to generals; he also describes American corpses carrying evidence of Viet Cong torture. In the final part, \\"In Death's Grey Land\\", Lt. Caputo is reassigned to a rifle company. He describes the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong as fierce and skilled fighters, earning the grudging respect of American soldiers. Lt. Caputo describes his fellow Marines as having stopped wishing for epic, World War II-style battles; they had learned to detect boobytraps, to counter-snipe and to comb the jungle in search of enemy bunkers and their rations. Lt. Caputo took part in these operations, until troops under his command miscarried orders and shot two suspects deliberately. Lt. Caputo assumed full responsibility for the incident and faced a general court- martial; he was relieved of his command and the charges were dropped. Lt. Caputo was then reassigned to a training camp in North Carolina and eventually received an honorable discharge from the service. In the Epilogue, almost ten years after the end of his tour of duty, Philip Caputo returned to Vietnam as a war journalist for a newspaper. Old memories of his war experiences and his comrades flood his mind as he witnesses the fall of Saigon to the troops of North Vietnam. Caputo left Vietnam on April 29, 1975. A postscript published in 1996 details some of the anxieties Caputo experienced while writing the memoir and the difficulties he had handling his fame and notoriety after its publication. 1980 TV miniseries Caputo's book was filmed as A Rumor of War at Camp Pendleton and Churubusco Studios, Mexico with a cast featuring Brad Davis, Brian Dennehy, Keith Carradine, Michael O'Keefe and Christopher Mitchum.
