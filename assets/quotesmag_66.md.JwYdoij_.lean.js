The engagement was notable for marking the first major deployment of rocket artillery in the Angolan Civil War, as well as the last serious attempt by ELNA forces to seize Luanda, the Angolan capital. It occurred on the last day of Portuguese colonial rule in the country, which formally received independence only hours after the fighting. After defeating a FAPLA garrison at the nearby town of Caxito, an army of ELNA militants led personally by Holden Roberto began advancing southwards towards Luanda. Roberto's forces included a composite battery of three BL 5.5-inch Medium Guns and two 130 mm Type 59 field guns manned by Zairean and South African artillery crews. Their objective was to dislodge FAPLA from the vital waterworks at Quifangondo and an adjoining bridge which spanned the Bengo River. Air cover for the ELNA offensive was provided by a squadron of South African English Electric Canberra bombers. The defenders consisted of FAPLA's 9th Brigade and just under a hundred Cuban military advisers, bolstered by a composite battery of ZiS-3 anti-tank guns and Grad rocket launchers. Following a poorly coordinated artillery bombardment and an ineffectual South African air strike, ELNA light and motorised infantry attacked the bridge early on the morning on 10 November, but became trapped in the open while crossing an elevated roadway and shelled by the defenders' rockets. The ELNA advance stalled, and the attackers were unable to regain their initiative. Roberto committed his reserves, but by noon his entire force had been routed with heavy casualties and nearly all their vehicles destroyed. The ELNA forces broke into a disorderly retreat and could only be re-mustered that evening. Realising the battle was lost, the South African and Zairean troops withdrew to the nearby port of Ambriz and were later evacuated by their respective governments. While the battle was taking place, Portugal renounced its claims to Angolan sovereignty and withdrew the remainder of its colonial administrative and military personnel from Luanda. On the morning of 11 November, the MPLA proclaimed the People's Republic of Angola, which was immediately recognised by Cuba, the Soviet Union, Brazil, and several sympathetic African states. ELNA had suffered such a catastrophic defeat at Quifangondo that Roberto was unable to launch another major offensive; over the next two months his forces were gradually scattered and destroyed by FAPLA and its Cuban allies. Background Since the late fifteenth century, Portugal had administered Angola as part of a vast African empire which included Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea (modern day Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau). Following the loss of Brazil and the erosion of its influence in the Americas during the early nineteenth century, Portugal increasingly refocused on the consolidation of its African colonies. As the largest, most developed, and most heavily populated colony in the Portuguese Empire, Angola came to replace Brazil as Lisbon's most valuable overseas possession. Angolan nationalists, led by the nascent Angolan Communist Party, periodically challenged colonial rule, to little avail. The trend towards global decolonisation during the late 1940s and 1950s delivered an unprecedented boost to nationalist confidence and ambitions, and in January 1961 the Angolan War of Independence broke out when radicalised peasants launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt. Between 1961 and 1964, three major nationalist movements rose to prominence in the fighting between the Portuguese security forces and local anti-colonial militants supported to varying degrees by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and several newly independent African states. The National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) was led by Holden Roberto and recruited mostly from the Bakongo population of northern Angola and the Cabinda exclave, an area traditionally dominated by the Kingdom of Kongo. In the central highlands and southern Angola, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was formed by Jonas Savimbi and drew its recruits from Ovimbundu farm labourers and itinerant peasants. A third movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), was formed by the Angolan Communist Party and targeted the embryonic upper working class of public sector workers in Luanda. Most of its senior leaders, namely Agostinho Neto, were professionals and intellectuals educated in European universities. It was in this educated elite that the combination of anti-colonial resentment and exposure to international political theory came to be most articulated; for example, the MPLA invested heavily in lobbying campaigns overseas which won it support and recognition among political leaders in Africa and the Middle East. Its use of Marxist political language and open criticism of the United States in particular proved effective at winning support with the Soviet Union and leftist governments elsewhere. FNLA leader Holden Roberto All three movements quickly formed militant wings to coordinate their insurgent campaigns against the Portuguese: the FNLA formed the National Liberation Army of Angola (ELNA), UNITA formed the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FALA), and the MPLA formed the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA). The creation of three separate insurgent armies provoked internecine strife which doomed any attempt to present a united front against the Portuguese and limited their effectiveness on the battlefield. Until the formation of the militant wings, disputes between the movements had been largely confined to political theory. However, beginning in late 1961 there were a number of clashes between ELNA and FAPLA that became central to the rivalry between the FNLA and MPLA, and evolved into outright hostility. It was not uncommon for ELNA to intercept and kill FAPLA personnel who strayed into its area of operations. Hamstrung by violent divisions, the insurgents aggravated the colonial administration but did not threaten its control of the territory. In late April 1974, Portugal's authoritarian Estado Novo government was toppled by the Carnation Revolution, which sounded the death knell for that country's pretensions as a colonial empire. Angolan nationalists perceived the political upheaval in Lisbon as an opportunity to upend the colonial order; the MPLA, FNLA, and UNITA rejected ceasefire requests and all demanded the Portuguese affirm an unconditional right to independence. General Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola, head of the Portuguese provisional government, was initially in favour of retaining the colonies as semi-autonomous federal subjects, but found little support for this measure in the progressive atmosphere which dominated local politics after the revolution. On 27 July 1974, he bowed to pressure and announced that the colonies were to be granted independence, unconditionally. By November 1974 the authority and morale of the Portuguese security forces in Angola had been seriously undermined; meanwhile, the three nationalist movements were attempting to exploit the developing power vacuum by amassing troops and stockpiling arms. The nationalists' political and military wings rushed to establish authority on the ground, moving rapidly to take over key towns left unguarded by the withdrawing Portuguese. Massive shipments of foreign arms from their various allies made the movements increasingly more lethal as tensions grew. The insurgents also seized large quantities of Portuguese weapons from the arsenals of disbanding colonial units. As long as their administrative structures were not attacked, the Portuguese made no attempt to enforce internal security, and the nationalists were able to continue their troop and weapons buildup unopposed. Prelude=ELNA expelled from Luanda= Luanda in the early 1970s, just prior to the civil war FAPLA benefited most from the erosion of Portuguese rule throughout mid-1974, seizing control of eleven of Angola's sixteen provincial capitals. However, distracted by an internal power struggle between Agostinho Neto and Daniel Chipenda, it was unable to consolidate its control of Luanda. In October, Holden Roberto took advantage of the situation to begin airlifting ELNA troops into Luanda from their training camps in neighbouring Zaire. With each movement extending its influence over the local population, the uneasy peace soon broke down and within a month the capital had erupted into bloody street battles. On 3 January 1975, at the behest of Organisation of African Unity, Neto, Roberto, and UNITA's Savimbi signed an accord in which they agreed to a permanent truce and promised to terminate mutually hostile propaganda. The nationalists then participated in a multi-party conference in Alvor, Portugal, which formed a coalition government of MPLA, FNLA, UNITA, and Portuguese representatives to govern Angola during the interim period. The coalition government would draft a constitution, to be followed by democratic elections. Angola's independence date was set for 11 November 1975, the four hundredth anniversary of the founding of Luanda. Fighting almost immediately broke out in Luanda again when Neto took advantage of the ceasefire to launch a purge of Chipenda's supporters. The Chipenda faction was largely annihilated, leaving ELNA as the only remaining obstacle to FAPLA control of the city. Chipenda and 2,000 of his surviving troops defected to ELNA around February, which further heightened tensions. ELNA had the largest number of personnel inside Angola at the time, and was further strengthened by over 400 tonnes of weaponry donated by the People's Republic of China and channelled through a sympathetic Zaire. ELNA also benefited from covert financial aid supplied by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Roberto was pressed by his field commanders to destroy Neto's forces while he held an indisputable advantage in manpower and logistics over his opponent. On 23 March, ELNA began attacking FAPLA bases in Luanda. A week later, a motorised column of 500 ELNA troops drove into the capital to join the fighting, unopposed by the Portuguese troops on duty. The threat posed by ELNA's troop buildup was proving far more formidable than Neto had anticipated, and near the end of March he appealed to the Soviet Union and Cuba for military backing. As an ELNA victory in Luanda had become more apparent, Soviet policymakers grew increasingly anxious about Angola. They believed that Angola's fate carried heavy implications for the global strategic and diplomatic momentum gained by the Soviet sphere after the end of the Vietnam War. They saw Roberto as an agent of Bakongo tribalism rather than a true revolutionary and assumed that his success would serve the interests of Beijing and Washington. The coincidence of Chinese and American patronage of Roberto was especially alarming, as it seemed to indicate the possibility of a future Sino-American alliance dominating Angola, to the detriment of Soviet interests. The result was approval of Neto's request for a massive increase in Soviet military aid to FAPLA. During March 1975 alone, Soviet pilots flew thirty planeloads of weapons into Brazzaville, where they were unloaded and transported by rail, truck, and ship to waiting FAPLA units around Luanda. In the span of three months, the Soviet Union had airlifted thirty million dollars' worth of weaponry to FAPLA. Neto had received enough new arms to equip an additional 20,000 troops, and this proved instrumental in turning the tide against Roberto. Additionally, a Soviet military delegation offered to provide training instructors and logistics staff during well-publicised talks with the MPLA leadership on 25 April. For its part, Cuba deployed a contingent of 230 military advisers and technicians to Angola to assemble Soviet hardware and train an influx of new FAPLA recruits. The first Cuban advisers began arriving in May. The infusion of Soviet arms helped fuel increasingly heavier confrontations in Luanda and provided the raw material for a major conventional FAPLA counteroffensive. In late May FAPLA violated a short-lived ceasefire by attacking and defeating several ELNA garrisons in the Cuanza Norte, Malanje, and U√≠ge provinces. Buoyed by these victories, the MPLA Politburo authorised a counteroffensive with the objective of isolating and destroying ELNA in Luanda. Between 3 June and 5 June, FAPLA eliminated the ELNA presence in the Cabinda exclave. The Portuguese succeeded in imposing a ceasefire on 7 June, but this was short-lived: the ELNA units stationed in Luanda had been sapped by the fighting in late May and the FAPLA general staff, detecting weakness, was eager to finish them off. On 9 July, FAPLA and the MPLA's popular militia resumed their counteroffensive, bringing the full weight of their Soviet-supplied weapons, including mortars and T-34-85 tanks, to bear against the lightly armed ELNA infantry. After several days of street battles, FAPLA was in full possession of Luanda, having driven ELNA out of the capital and its outlying suburbs. ELNA released a press statement accusing Cuban advisers of having played a major role in the FAPLA counteroffensive. Placing emphasis on the fact that FAPLA had violated the most recent ceasefire, Roberto announced he was no longer prepared to negotiate peace with Neto. The MPLA responded that it would likewise no longer negotiate peace and would pursue the war until the FNLA and ELNA were permanently defeated. =Zaire and South Africa intervene= Following its expulsion from Luanda, ELNA withdrew to the nearby port of Ambriz, where it established its new military headquarters and began planning a counteroffensive on Luanda. Roberto, who had hitherto directed the war effort from Kinshasa, immediately made preparations to return to Angola and manage all ELNA operations personally. He claimed he would capture Luanda before Angolan independence. For the time being, however, he contented himself with preparing for that decisive action. Over the late summer and early fall, ELNA recruited more troops and consolidated its control over most of northern Angola. Mobutu Sese Seko, Roberto's personal ally in Zaire, pictured in 1975 ELNA procurement agents turned to Zaire and the United States with requests for more arms, which they needed to counterbalance Soviet and Cuban aid to FAPLA and shift the military balance back in Roberto's favour. The CIA agreed to send fourteen million dollars' worth of materiel collectively to ELNA and FALA, including trucks, radio equipment, small arms, and anti-tank weapons. To keep its involvement covert, it used Zaire as a conduit for the flow of American-made arms to ELNA. Cover was provided through a parallel programme to equip the Zairean Armed Forces. South Africa also offered to provide substantial assistance to ELNA, offering logistical support, small arms, ammunition, and training. South African military advisers under Commandant Jan Breytenbach subsequently entered Angola to begin providing basic training and technical instruction on the weapons provided. South Africa's decision to throw aid behind ELNA and FALA marked the first definitive step toward its own deep embroilment in the Angolan war, the beginning of a series of escalations which would lead to the commitment of regular ground forces on 23 October. Of all ELNA's external benefactors, Roberto looked optimistically to his personal ally, Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko, for direct military support. During the early stages of the civil war, the Zairean government had provided aircraft to transport ELNA militants to Luanda. In addition, Zaire furbished ELNA with thousands of obsolete rifles from its own reserve stocks, as well as Panhard AML armoured cars which were airlifted directly to Ambriz. Zairean army regulars‚Äîtwo battalions of paratroops, numbering about 1,200 men‚Äîbegan crossing into Angola on 18 May. Neto complained that Angola was being subject to a \\"silent invasion by soldiers from Zaire\\", prompting the Portuguese to lodge an official protest with Mobutu at the end of May. Emboldened by arms deliveries and commitments of additional support, Roberto ordered his troops to seize the strategic crossroads town of Caxito, which was less than northeast of Luanda. ELNA drove a FAPLA garrison out of the town on 24 July, where it held a triumphant press conference for the international media. For publicity purposes, it announced that Caxito as well as the highway leading south towards Luanda would be renamed in honour of Roberto. However, within a week ELNA advances south of Caxito had been checked by stiff FAPLA resistance. On 30 August, ELNA resumed its offensive and progressed as far as Quifangondo before being halted again by FAPLA. FAPLA launched a counteroffensive with its conventional 9th Brigade on 4 September, and ELNA began a disorderly retreat, abandoning scores of weapons and crates of ammunition with American markings. FAPLA recaptured Caxito and publicly displayed the captured munitions as proof of CIA collaboration with Roberto. ELNA called in reinforcements, and supported by Zairean paratroopers, recaptured Caxito on 17 September. Between 23 September and 26 September, ELNA succeeded in capturing Morro de Cal, a hill which overlooked the Luanda highway and located only from Quifangondo. A FAPLA attack on Morro de Cal on 23 October was unsuccessful, and on Cuban advice Neto's troops shifted their focus to strengthening their defensive works around Quifangondo. Roberto planned to use Morro de Cal as a springboard for his final assault on Quifangondo, which he delayed to November. Opposing forces=ELNA= In January 1975, ELNA was the largest of the three Angolan armies, with 21,000 armed regulars. However, no more than half of ELNA's manpower was actually inside Angola at any one time, since Roberto preferred to keep his most dependable forces in reserve to garrison their external base camps in Zaire. At the beginning of the year there were 9,000 ELNA troops in Angola. In October there were still only about 10,000 ELNA troops in Angola, nearly all of them concentrated in the northern provinces of the territory. They were swelled by a number of new Bakongo recruits enlisted since ELNA's expulsion from Luanda, as well as the 2,000 ex-FAPLA defectors under Daniel Chipenda. Of these troops, most were needed to garrison ELNA's Bakongo heartland, and Roberto was able to muster no more than 3,500 troops for his fall advances on Luanda. The CIA estimated there were 2,500 ELNA personnel in or around Caxito in August 1975. Between 1,000 and 2,000 of these forces were available for Roberto's final November offensive towards Quifangondo, the remainder apparently being held in reserve in Caxito. According to Roberto's own figures, he had 2,000 troops on the offensive along the Caxito-Quifangondo front. These men were for the most part raw, undisciplined, and inexperienced. A sizeable majority were recent recruits enrolled with little training; few had been under hostile fire. Also in the ELNA force were 120 veterans of the Portuguese Army who enlisted under Roberto. The CIA described them as Angolan- born colonials that had fallen on hard times, and often volunteered with ELNA for ideological reasons. The Portuguese contingent was commanded by Colonel Gilberto Manuel Santos e Castro. Colonel Santos e Castro was ELNA's chief of staff and the senior ELNA field commander present at Quifangondo. ELNA militants at a training camp in Zaire Roberto insisted on directing the offensive personally, although he had no prior military experience and often ignored the recommendations of his more experienced South African and Portuguese advisers. ELNA lacked a coherent command structure and its units were inconsistently organised. Furthermore, Roberto's ignorance of logistics hampered ELNA's ability to distribute or maintain the equipment it received from its allies. John Stockwell, a CIA observer sent to evaluate ELNA's capabilities in late 1975, noted that ELNA had received adequate quantities of arms and ammunition, but was \\"not able to organize the logistical systems necessary to deploy them or to develop the communications, maintenance, combat leadership, and discipline to organize an effective military effort\\". One of ELNA's primary weaknesses was its failure to encourage technical proficiency, which in turn ensured that most of its recruits were unwilling or unable to familiarise themselves with their weapons. Individual marksmanship and maintenance of personal weapons were quite poor. Peter McAleese, a mercenary attached to Roberto's forces during the civil war, declared that the ELNA troops he inspected \\"were useless. They had been trained by the Chinese at Kinkusu in Zaire and spent their time learning...slogans rather than training with their weapons, which they hardly fired, even on the range.\\" ELNA claimed to the press in late August that it possessed tanks, and threatened to use them during future offensives on Luanda. Zaire apparently undertook to supply ELNA with up to 25 Type 59 tanks, but whether Roberto's forces actually received them remains unclear. Only two may have been transferred to ELNA, and they were supplied without crews or tank transporters to move them. The tanks arrived too late to be used in the fighting at Quifangondo. At the beginning of November, the only comparable armour ELNA possessed were nine antiquated Panhard AML-60 and AML-90 armoured cars, all of which were in decrepit condition due to age and poor maintenance. It also had at least one Panhard M3 VTT armoured personnel carrier, likely one of several abandoned in Angola by the withdrawing Portuguese. The ELNA infantry was equipped with a miscellaneous array of Western, Chinese, and Soviet small arms. The increased flow of foreign material and financial aid beginning in August had done little to improve this situation due to logistics woes and corruption in the Zairean Armed Forces, which had diverted the most modern CIA-supplied weapons bound for ELNA to its own arsenals. The small arms ELNA did receive intact from the CIA and Zaire were all obsolete or approaching obsolescence, and hopelessly outclassed by FAPLA's sophisticated Soviet weaponry. For fire support, ELNA had six 120 mm mortars of American origin. These had been part of a larger arms shipment supplied by the CIA in August, along with 3,430 high-explosive 120 mm projectiles. Aside from the mortars, the ELNA infantry had six M40 recoilless rifles, mounted on jeeps. The shortage of heavy support weapons during Roberto's offensive was always one of his primary concerns, and he repeatedly appealed to his allies for assistance in this regard. =Zaire and South Africa= Zairean army regulars began infiltrating northern Angola in May, taking advantage of border crossings left unguarded by the Portuguese. On 11 September, possibly with tacit CIA encouragement, Mobutu ordered that paratroops of the 4th and 7th Zairean Commando Battalions be deployed to support the thrust towards Luanda. Both units were immediately airlifted to the ELNA headquarters at Ambriz. They were placed under the collective command of the senior Zairean military officer in Angola, Colonel Manima Lama. ELNA's lack of technical expertise increased the importance of the Zairean personnel, who were expected to operate the few sophisticated heavy weapons Roberto had acquired. The CIA also hoped that the presence of Zairean officers and non- commissioned officers would help bolster ELNA's weak leadership and command structure. At the time of its intervention in Angola, however, the Zairean Armed Forces was being devastated by a series of internal political purges, which probably hindered its ability to assist ELNA further. Morale across the armed forces, even among the elite battalions being deployed to Ambriz, was low. The size of the Zairean military contingent in Angola peaked at 1,200 between May and September 1975. The two paratroop battalions proved instrumental in retaking Caxito from FAPLA on 17 September. At least 700 Zairean paratroopers were selected to help spearhead the final assault on Quifangondo. The remainder were present on the battlefield but likely held in reserve. The first field artillery support ELNA received was provided by two 130 mm Type 59 field guns delivered by Mobutu's government in early September. These guns were manned by Zairean crews and were of Chinese origin, although Mobutu had sourced them somewhat circuitously from North Korea. They had an effective range of . The Zairean fire missions were rarely accurate, but had a notable impact on the morale of the FAPLA troops, who lacked comparable long- range artillery at the time. Roberto insisted he needed more artillery to take Luanda. On 8 November, a senior South African artillery officer, Major Jack Bosch, arrived with three BL 5.5-inch Medium Guns. These had an effective range of . Stockwell derided the guns as \\"obsolete weapons with limited range\\", noting they were not an improvement on the Zairean artillery already present. Nevertheless, they were the only moderately ranged artillery South Africa was capable of fielding on short notice. The guns were so large and heavy they had to be disassembled prior to being airlifted to Ambriz. Lacking gun tractors, the South African crews commandeered a combination of civilian vehicles and abandoned Portuguese Army trucks to tow them to Morro de Cal. When the Battle of Quifangondo began, there were 20 South African artillerymen of enlisted rank present, excluding their officers and a medical orderly. Including the artillery officers, logistics personnel, and the advisers already attached to ELNA, the total South African military presence on the Caxito-Quifangondo front was about 54 men. Aside from the gun crews, none took any active part in the fighting. =FAPLA= At the beginning of 1975, FAPLA had between 5,000 and 8,000 men under arms, most of them recent recruits. The Portuguese government estimated that FAPLA had an effective fighting strength of 5,500 armed regulars, although when its irregular formations are taken into account it may have been able to muster a considerably larger force. FAPLA pursued a unique military doctrine which dictated separate and distinct roles for both a regular army and a \\"people's militia\\". This was reflective of a particular school of Marxist-Leninist political thought which considered a people's militia to be the most appropriate local defence force under a socialist system. People's militias were to be managed democratically and have no outward distinctions of rank, thus counterbalancing the trend towards the formation of a military caste. By early July, the MPLA had armed thousands of its political supporters from the Luanda slums with Soviet-supplied small arms, organising them into a people's militia which effectively functioned as FAPLA's strategic reserve and played a key role of the expulsion of ELNA from the capital. FAPLA's regular and irregular units underwent an unprecedented expansion between January and November to combat the continued ELNA threat to Luanda, as well as parallel FALA advances to the south. Jo√£o Luis Neto \\"Xiyetu\\", FAPLA's chief of general staff, authorised a massive recruitment campaign with the objective of doubling troop numbers to 20,000 by November; this would put FAPLA approximately on par with ELNA in terms of manpower. By the end of March, the Soviet Union had supplied FAPLA with enough arms and ammunition to accommodate its doubling in personnel. In April FAPLA recruited 3,000 ex-Katangese veterans of the Congo Crisis, who had been exiled to Angola following a failed secession attempt over a decade earlier. FAPLA recruiters capitalised on their collective hostility towards Mobutu's regime in Zaire to enlist their support against his Angolan ally, Roberto. The recruitment campaign apparently exceeded expectations; FAPLA reached an estimated troop strength of 20,000 around August. These forces were partly concentrated in Luanda and the country's other seaports, namely Lobito, Cabinda, and Mo√ß√¢medes, and partly scattered in isolated garrisons across the vast, underdeveloped interior. Like their ELNA counterparts, the FAPLA fighters were mostly inexperienced; they were drawn from the ranks of Luanda's unemployed working class, political activists, and trade unionists, and possessed little instinct in military fieldcraft. As early as October 1974 the Soviets offered assistance in training and arming up to 2,000 handpicked FAPLA recruits to form the nucleus of a regular FAPLA brigade capable of undertaking conventional military operations. FAPLA considered the Soviets' offer seriously, and even drew up plans for the brigade, which its general staff envisaged as a motorised rapid reaction force (\\"Brigada de Intervenci√≥n\\"). However, Moscow's offer was contingent on FAPLA sending the necessary recruits to the Soviet Union for their training. Neto balked at the suggestion. He insisted that sending his best troops overseas meant they would unavailable in the event of a crisis on the home front. With the civil war raging, FAPLA simply could not spare 2,000 men. In the end, a compromise was reached: only the officers and weapons specialists of the new unit would be sent for training. In March 1975, the first recruits departed for the Soviet Union. Between 20 and 30 officers were instructed at the Vystrel course near Moscow, while another 200 enlisted men received conventional warfare training at a Soviet military base in Perevalnoe, Crimea. In September they returned and mustered into service as part of the newly designated FAPLA 9th Brigade. The Soviet Union armed and equipped the brigade with a shipload of vehicles and heavy weapons delivered to Pointe-Noire in August, which FAPLA had transported to Luanda. After being outfitted, the 9th Brigade was placed under the command of David Moises \\"Ndozi\\" and deployed along the Caxito-Quifangondo front on 4 September. Elements of the 9th Brigade formed the core of the FAPLA blocking force between the ELNA offensive and Luanda in November, and Moises was the senior FAPLA field commander present at Quifangondo. Not all of the 9th Brigade was deployed at Quifangondo; the unit, already understrength, was depleted further when some of the returnees from the Soviet Union were diverted south to fight FALA. The FAPLA position at Quifangondo was also undermined by the departure of 200 ex-Katangese troops, who were present until late October, when they were also diverted south to check a FALA offensive on Benguela. The reduced FAPLA garrison, approximately 850 to just over 1,000 strong, was deemed capable of holding Quifangondo against Roberto's army for the immediate future. Aside from the members of the 9th Brigade, who were generally trained well to use their weapons, the bulk of the FAPLA garrison was made of new recruits evacuated from a training camp in Vila Salazar. In late October, FAPLA had closed the camp and abandoned Vila Salazar to refocus on defending Luanda. The Vila Salazar recruits were hastily thrown into battle during the unsuccessful attack on Morro do Cal, and had been driven back to Quifangondo by a combined ELNA-Zairean force along with the other FAPLA troops. The FAPLA infantry was, for the most part, equipped with various Kalashnikov-pattern automatic rifles of Soviet bloc origin, although older Czechoslovak vz. 52 rifles, donated by Cuba from its reserve stocks, were commonly used as well. The vz. 52s had been delivered for the express purpose of arming the battalions raised in a select few training camps, including Vila Salazar, and would have been carried by the recruits from there. In heavy support weapons FAPLA was generally superior to its opponents. It possessed large quantities of RPG-7s, also supplied by Cuba, 82 mm mortars, and B-10 recoilless rifles. The only heavy armour Neto's forces possessed for most of 1975 were 12 T-34-85 medium tanks of World War II vintage donated by Yugoslavia. The tanks were reportedly used to drive ELNA out of Luanda in July. References to these tanks began appearing in FALA and South African reports in September. That same month, the Soviet Union donated another 10 T-34-85s to FAPLA, promising to have them delivered to Luanda before 10 November. While not very formidable from a conventional standpoint, the presence of the archaic T-34-85s was a decisive factor, since ELNA had no tanks of its own to counter them. As Roberto's troops neared Luanda in early November, the tanks were dug into the hills east of the capital, but could be mobilised quickly if ELNA overran the defensive works at Quifangondo. FAPLA ZIS-3 76 mm divisional gun at the South African National Museum of Military History The garrison at Quifangondo was well-equipped with artillery and heavy support weapons. It included the 9th Brigade's integral artillery battery under the command of Roberto Leal Ramos Monteiro \\"Ngongo\\", with 12 76 mm ZiS-3 divisional guns. The ZiS-3 had an effective range of . While extremely versatile as infantry support weapons, the divisional guns were considered inadequate to repel a determined assault by attackers with artillery support of their own, and in September the Soviets agreed to supply FAPLA with BM-21 Grad truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers. The BM-21 had a range of and could fire salvoes of 40 122mm rockets at a time. At the beginning of November, the first two BM-21s were flown into Point-Noire by Soviet pilots over the objections of Neto and his staff, who wanted them airlifted directly to Luanda. Within a few days, a total of six BM-21s had been delivered and stockpiled at Point-Noire. There, they were reassembled by Cuban technicians and transported by ship to Luanda, arriving on 7 November. The rocket launchers were supplied with ample ammunition; however, the Soviets had neglected to include the necessary fuses. This rendered them impotent until the evening of 9 November, when fuses were finally flown in from Cuba. Whether any of the BM-21s were deployed to Quifangondo after 7 November is a matter of dispute. Western and South African sources nearly all reported their presence at Quifangondo during the battle on 10 November. CIA observers attached to Roberto's staff present during the engagement also claimed they were there. However, Monteiro was adamant that his battery at Quifangondo did not include any BM-21s, only six man-portable, single-tube Grad-Ps, which utilised the same ammunition but were not capable of firing multiple projectiles in salvo. FAPLA sources do not generally acknowledge the combat deployment of the BM-21 until the 9th Brigade's final offensive on Caxito later in the month. One Soviet source suggests the BM-21s were not deployed along the frontlines at Quifangondo, but to the rear, alongside the reserves. =Cuba= At Neto's request a large Cuban military mission deployed to Angola in October: some 500 officers and men under Ra√∫l D√≠az Arg√ºelles, former head of the D√©cima Direcci√≥n, a directorate which coordinated all Cuban military operations overseas. From September onward, these advisers instructed FAPLA in conventional warfare at training camps in Henrique de Carvalho, Benguela, Vila Salazar, and Cabinda. Their objective was to train, arm, and equip 4,800 FAPLA recruits for 16 new infantry battalions, 25 mortar companies, and an air defence corps. Cuban armour crews and artillerymen were also deployed to operate FAPLA's more sophisticated hardware, namely its tanks and heavy artillery, until adequate numbers of FAPLA recruits could be trained to replace them. A detail of 20 of Cuba's most experienced artillery specialists was formed specifically to service and operate the six BM-21s. On 19 October, Arg√ºelles drew up a defence plan for Luanda and ordered the training centre at Vila Salazar evacuated so he could shift most of the men there to Quifangondo. At this time, 58 Cuban personnel were stationed at Quifangondo, including 40 instructors from Vila Salazar. A battalion of internal troops from the Cuban Ministry of Interior was appointed as the general reserve on its arrival in Luanda around 8 November. It would form the second line of defence at Quifangondo. The BM-21s, manned by the 20 Cuban artillery specialists, may have been located near their position, possibly to the rear. There were at least 88 Cubans in the first line of defence, including the training instructors from Vila Salazar; following Cuban military tradition, they were expected to fight alongside their students. Arg√ºelles was so short of men that he ordered a Cuban mortar company and some anti-aircraft specialists redeployed from Cabinda to join the defenders at Quifangondo. Tactical considerations Quifangondo was a small village in northern Luanda Province, some from downtown Luanda. Prior to the civil war, the settlement was primarily known for being the location of a reservoir which supplied water to Luanda. Its defence had assumed increasing importance in FAPLA command circles early in the fighting, when damage to the Dondo hydroelectric complex to the east made the capital even more dependent on the Quifangondo waterworks. The hills around Quifangondo dominated the northern approaches to Luanda, overlooking the highway towards Funda in the east and Caxito to the north. The section of highway leading northwards to Caxito was bounded to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east, by impassable swampland. Movement off the road was generally difficult for wheeled vehicles. Just outside Quifangondo, the swampland gave way to a body of water known as Panguila Lake. Roberto's capture of Caxito in late July left Quifangondo and much of northern Luanda Province open to an invasion by ELNA forces. In October, when ELNA troops began encroaching on the capital, Quifangondo became even more vulnerable, partly due to its proximity to Morro de Cal. Cuban combat engineers supervised the construction of scaled defences around Quifangondo, including underground bunkers to provide some measure of protection from ELNA's artillery bombardments. Arg√ºelles's plan for the defence of Luanda was to use the garrison at Quifangondo to underpin the extremity of his western flank, while other Cuban and FAPLA units assembled into a series of hastily conceived defensive lines which extended from Quifangondo to Funda, and from Funda to Cacuaco. Additional Cuban troops were held in reserve in the Grafanil district, where several FAPLA arms depots were located. ELNA forces first probed Quifangondo on 30 August. After the unsuccessful FAPLA assault on Morro de Cal on 23 October, ELNA pursued the withdrawing FAPLA and Cuban troops to Quifangondo, but was unable to follow up on its advantage and take the settlement. On 5 November, ELNA infantry accompanied by armoured cars carried out another probing action to test the strength of the defences. As soon as the vehicles were within range, they came under heavy fire from the rockets and divisional guns of the 9th Brigade, forcing the ELNA troops to withdraw. On 8 November, ELNA and Zairean troops made a second attempt to approach the village, but were again subject to withering artillery fire and forced to abandon their advance. These experiences had the effect of persuading Roberto he needed more guns of his own to suppress the FAPLA battery. South Africa's subsequent delivery of three medium guns and promises of air support, via a squadron of English Electric Canberra bombers, encouraged Roberto to launch his final assault, which was scheduled for 10 November. Brigadier Ben Roos, the senior South African field officer present, soon had an opportunity to assess the enemy and the imposing hills around Quifangondo. He found the FAPLA line at Quifangondo to be a formidable defensive position indeed, and noted the presence of FAPLA guns and artillery covering the ground with infantry in strength. Roos argued that an assault on this position would be \\"tantamount to suicide\\". The more Roos reported his observations, the clearer it became to his superiors that attack might be futile. General Constand Viljoen, South Africa's director of army operations, had visited Roberto and his staff at Ambriz a few days earlier and spent some time studying the terrain before them. He was accompanied by General Magnus Malan, who was the chief of the South African Army at the time. Viljoen and Roos, who believed ELNA was woefully inadequate as a conventional fighting force, argued that Roberto should wage a defensive campaign if possible. They recommended that Roberto retire north to some defensive position between Caxito and Ambriz, strengthening his grip on the countryside around Luanda. Roberto's CIA benefactors were equally apprehensive, and endorsed a withdrawal from the Quifangondo front in favour of a broad encircling movement from the east. Roberto rejected their counsel. This was his last chance to destroy FAPLA before Angolan independence was bestowed; furthermore, he thought it desirable to strike before FAPLA was further strengthened by its Cuban and Soviet allies. The South Africans reluctantly resigned themselves to supporting the attack, gambling on the likelihood that if their guns could drive the defenders underground into their bunkers, then an immediate and well- coordinated infantry assault might break through. Colonel e Castro, who supported a direct frontal assault on Quifangondo, was responsible for most of the operational planning for the attack. However, some of the other Portuguese volunteers were more skeptical. The dissenters insisted that Roberto should consider a flanking movement through the swamps as his main avenue of approach. Alternatively, flanking attacks could be made through the swamps to support the main advance along the highway. This option had already been discussed between Roberto and his South African advisers and rejected for several reasons: the swampy terrain east of the highway was impassable to the wheeled vehicles, possessed inadequate cover to bestow an advantage in concealment, and the ELNA infantry had flatly refused to cross it on foot, citing the hazard posed by crocodiles and venomous snakes. Battle=South African artillery and air bombardment= On the evening of 9 November, the South African and Zairean artillery on Morro de Cal began firing. For several hours they fired on Quifangondo and beyond the defenders' lines, towards Luanda. Several shells landed near the Luanda refinery. Others appear to have been targeting the FAPLA facilities in the Grafanil district. The bombardment killed a civilian in Grafanil, but did not cause any FAPLA or Cuban casualties. The FAPLA guns did not respond, leading some of the ELNA troops to erroneously conclude that the Quifangondo defences had been abandoned. Three South African English Electric Canberra bombers flying in close formation, early 1970s. At 5:40 a.m. Major Bosch ordered ranging shots be fired at the Quifangondo waterworks and the bridge spanning the Bengo River. For nineteen minutes afterwards, his guns fired airburst shells over the FAPLA lines. Bosch ceased fire at 5:59 a.m. to await the anticipated air strike, which occurred on schedule. Three Canberra bomber aircraft launched from the South African Air Force base at Rundu appeared presently and initiated a bombing run over the FAPLA lines. Anxious to maintain plausible deniability, the South African government had ordered the Canberra pilots to fly at such high altitudes they could not identify their targets. Only four of the Canberras' nine bombs were dropped, and none struck the defenders. After making this single unsuccessful pass, the aircraft returned to Rundu. Roos and Bosch observed that the morning's artillery bombardment and the follow-up strike by the Canberras had at least achieved the desirable psychological effect: they noticed the FAPLA troops on the other side of the Bengo River moving to the rear. Any advantage would be lost unless the ELNA infantry immediately started forward. Much to their frustration, this did not occur as the ELNA commanders were waiting on Roberto, who had insisted on witnessing the attack in person. Roberto was at the time taking his breakfast, and his leisurely pace in reaching the front delayed the ELNA advance by almost forty minutes. To complicate matters further, not all the ELNA infantry sections were in position and not all their commanders had been briefed on the details of the attack. Some had consequently overslept. This caused further delays as the senior ELNA staff held an order group to detail the attack for the field commanders. Meanwhile, all the FAPLA defenders had returned to their fighting positions. =The ELNA assault= At 7:40 a.m. Roberto's force began their advance. ELNA's nine Panhard AML armoured cars manned by the Portuguese volunteers emerged from the cover of the palm groves north of Quifangondo and started down the open highway towards the village. They were trailed by more ELNA fighters riding in six jeeps and manning 106 mm recoilless rifles. The rest of the assault group was trucked as far as Morro de Cal, then dismounted and followed the vehicles on foot. Despite the morning's delays, morale was high, as the attackers had been able to see their ultimate objective‚ÄîLuanda‚Äîfrom Morro de Cal. At this point there were about 600 regular ELNA infantry and 700 Zairean paratroops on the road. Roberto's remaining troops were held near Morro de Cal in reserve. The ELNA column was now within range of the artillery battery of the FAPLA 9th Brigade, but the defenders were under strict orders to hold their fire until the entire attacking force was enclosed within a predetermined kill zone between the lagoon and the shoreline from east to west, or when the vehicles had reached the section of elevated highway over Panguila Lake. Monteiro \\"Ngongo\\" had positioned his six Grad-P rocket launchers over the crest of a hill to protect them from South African and Zairean counter-battery action, but he and a second officer were posted within view of the highway to direct their fire. When most of the attackers were on the highway spanning Panguila Lake and the AML armoured cars had begun to approach the Bengo River, the defenders opened fire. Monteiro apparently gave the order when the FAPLA trenches came under fire from the lead AML's co-axial machine gun. Monteiro's battery of ZiS-3 divisional guns, working in concert with FAPLA infantry armed with B-10 recoilless rifles, immediately knocked out the three trailing AMLs. The wrecked armoured cars trapped the others at the lead of the column, cutting off their only avenue of retreat. In quick succession, the FAPLA guns and recoilless rifles also destroyed all six of the unarmoured jeeps. Monteiro's Grad-Ps fired a few speculatory rockets at the South African and Zairean artillery positions, but their crews concluded they lacked the range to engage the larger guns effectively. Thereafter they began firing rockets into the exposed ELNA and Zairean infantry. Many of the ELNA troops broke and fled after the first rocket salvo. Others sought cover in the swampy terrain adjacent to the road. At length the defenders also began to shell the demoralised infantry column with mortars. The confines of the highway offered FAPLA the opportunity to focus all its fire along the relatively narrow axis of ELNA's advance. 122mm rocket fired from the Grad-P and BM-21. Roberto ordered the deployment of his six CIA-supplied 120 mm mortars, but when they were brought to the front their firing pins were inexplicably missing. Meanwhile, the South African and Zairean guns began to engage in an artillery duel with Monteiro's battery. Security for the guns was supposed to be provided by a line of ELNA troops forward of their emplacements, but these fled when the first rockets landed near their positions. One of the Zairean field guns experienced a catastrophic explosion in its breech upon attempting to fire its first round of the battle. The incident occurred after the gun had been double loaded with propellant by its inexperienced crew, all of whom died in the blast. The second Zairean field gun was later disabled by a misfire, which injured its crew. The South African guns remained operational, but they lacked the range to neutralise the Grad-Ps and could not match their rate of fire. A member of one of the artillery crews was wounded by a shell fragment; he was the only South African casualty at Quifangondo. Accounts on the volume of FAPLA artillery fire and the degree to which Cuban BM-21s may have participated in the battle remain contradictory. John Stockwell estimated that \\"two thousand rockets rained on the task force as it broke and fled in panic.\\" Stockwell also claimed that truck-mounted BM-21s played an active role during the battle at Quifangondo, enabling their crews to quickly displace whenever they came under counter-battery fire from the South African guns. Monteiro was adamant that the only rocket artillery which took part in the fighting were his six Grad-Ps, and estimated that he only fired ten salvoes of six rockets each at the attackers. Within the first hour of the battle, FAPLA had destroyed virtually all of ELNA's vehicles and inflicted serious casualties on the assault group. The surviving infantry withdrew in disarray to an abandoned chicken farm near Morro de Cal, where Roberto reinforced them with his reserves. Attempts to reconstitute the assault group at the farm were severely hampered by two salvoes of enemy rocket fire, possibly from the Cuban BM-21s behind the FAPLA lines, which struck the site and inflicted heavy casualties on the ELNA troops massing for a second attack. By 11:00 a.m. the ELNA reserves had begun a disorderly route. Roos, who had watched the attack stall and disintegrate from his position on Morro de Cal, ordered Bosch to withdraw with his guns to a position north of the Dondo River. The South African artillery crews worked frantically through the night to extricate the guns from Morro de Cal, before reaching the Dondo River amid a backwash of wounded and demoralised stragglers from broken ELNA units. The Zairean paratroops also joined in the general withdrawal northwards, but regrouped at the Dondo River, where Colonel Lama tried to rally the survivors against the counterattack he expected from FAPLA. The remnants of Colonel e Castro's Portuguese volunteers regrouped separately, a short distance northeast of Morro de Cal. FAPLA did not press its advantage, and only followed ELNA's retreat with caution weeks after the battle. In the words of South African historian Willem Steenkamp, \\"the Cubans and FAPLA missed a marvelous opportunity to deal the FNLA a major knockout blow: a reasonably strong mechanised force could have taken full advantage of the general confusion and panic to thrust all the way to Ambriz.\\" Aftermath=Casualties= Combined ELNA and Zairean military casualties at the Battle of Quifangondo were between 100 and 150 dead, and around 200 wounded. Roberto stated that ELNA alone had suffered 120 confirmed dead, and estimated the total number of wounded as probably being double that. According to American military analyst Spencer C. Tucker, an accurate count would be higher, with the number of ELNA and Zairean dead running into the multiple hundreds. South Africa suffered one wounded. The Portuguese volunteers suffered five dead. ELNA lost the vast majority of its vehicles at Quifangondo, including all six jeep-mounted recoilless rifles and at least four armoured cars. Both Zairean field guns were destroyed or rendered inoperable, and abandoned on the battlefield; the surviving crew was evacuated to Ambriz. After the battle, a Zairean soldier was found alive in a wrecked armoured car and taken prisoner by FAPLA. FAPLA suffered one dead‚Äîa recruit who had disobeyed orders and left his trench when the fighting started; he was killed by ELNA machine gun fire. An additional three FAPLA personnel were wounded. Cuba suffered two wounded. =Impact on ELNA= The Battle of Quifangondo had enormous strategic implications for the course of the Angolan Civil War. It dashed Roberto's hopes of capturing Luanda before Angola's independence date, and all but assured Neto's continued grip on the Angolan capital. At 6:00 p.m. that day the Portuguese high commissioner, Leonel Alexandre Gomes Cardoso, announced that Portugal was transferring sovereignty of its colony to \\"the Angolan people\\" and departed Luanda by sea. He was followed shortly thereafter by the last of the Portuguese military personnel. At midnight, Neto proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Angola. The new state was immediately recognised by 30 sovereign nations, including the Soviet Union, Brazil, and Cuba. In response, Roberto and his UNITA counterpart Savimbi proclaimed the People's Democratic Republic of Angola, which was not recognised by any country, even their traditional allies Zaire and South Africa. Modern relief at Quifangondo commemorating the FAPLA victory. Among Roberto's supporters, the psychological repercussions of his failure to take the capital far exceeded the losses of men and materiel. As exaggerated accounts of the defeat spread through ELNA's ranks, discipline rapidly collapsed and sabotaged Roberto's attempts at consolidating his forces. Thousands of Roberto's soldiers did not withdraw towards Ambriz with their leader. Roberto had lost all but two companies‚Äîalmost his entire army‚Äîalong the Caxito-Ambriz front by 24 November. His foreign allies gradually evaporated, too. In the aftermath of the battle, Colonel Lama lost almost two-thirds of his command due to desertion. Brigadier Roos gave Roberto some parting advice on fighting delaying actions and arranged to have his logistics staff and artillery crews evacuated from Ambriz by a South African Navy frigate, the SAS President Steyn. On 17 November, the frigate's crew used a helicopter and several inflatable boats to extract all South African personnel from the Ambriz shoreline. The 5.5 inch medium guns were initially towed to Zaire to prevent them from falling into FAPLA's hands. All were returned to South Africa by plane shortly afterwards. In his book The Cuban Intervention in Angola, Edward George wrote that \\"it is no exaggeration to say that the battle of Quifangondo destroyed the FNLA, even if fighting between them and the FAPLA‚ÄìCubans was to continue for another four months.\\" Tonta Afonso Castro, a member of the ELNA general staff, later commented that the morale of the FNLA's political wing had been just as badly shaken: \\"we retreated [from Quifangondo]. However, in this defeat, the political party became much more defeated than the soldiers who were on the ground.\\" On December 5, FAPLA finally launched a major counteroffensive northwards, recapturing Caxito. Roberto had little alternative but to abandon Ambriz and flee towards the Zairean border. The last Zairean paratroops withdrew from northern Angola around that time. Stockwell caustically wrote of the undisciplined Zairean withdrawal: \\"Mobutu's finest...vented their frustration on the villages and towns in the path of their flight, in a tidal wave of terrorism, rape, and pillage, until the Kongo tribesmen of northern Angola prayed for the early arrival of the MPLA and Cuban liberators.\\" Deprived of its last remaining ally, ELNA was no match for the combined FAPLA and Cuban armies marshalled against it, and from January 1976 onwards the war in northern Angola became a virtually one-sided affair, with FAPLA advancing rapidly towards the Zairean border in the face of sporadic local resistance. With most of his traditional areas of support under FAPLA occupation, and the final collapse of ELNA as a fighting force, Roberto's bid for political power in Angola was over. He fled into exile in Zaire in February 1976. South of Luanda, the fighting continued unabated for decades between FAPLA and FALA until the latter was finally defeated in 2002, ending the civil war.

The reef formation was discovered by geologist Increase A. Lapham in the 1830s. It and other fossilized coral reefs that he discovered were the first geological reef formations described in North America, and are among the first described in the world. This reef was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Setting The formation is located northeast of the junction of Wood Avenue and General Mitchell Boulevard, on the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center grounds.Virtual Silurian Reef - Milwaukee Public Museum It consists of the lower of a high bluff extending east-west for a distance of about . The bluff is the only fully natural formation of its type remaining in Milwaukee County. It is located on the northern border of the VA grounds. History Soldiers' Home Reef was formed during the Silurian period of the Paleozoic Era, about 400 million years ago, when Wisconsin lay under a shallow tropical sea. Beneath that sea, ancient corals constructed the reef where trilobites, cephalopods, brachiopods, pelmatozoans, bivalves, and bryozoans lived and were eventually preserved as limestone. In more recent geologic time, the hard limestone mound was overrun by one or more glaciers, but resisted the grinding action, forming a roche moutonn√©e, which was then covered by glacial deposits, then exposed again by the Menomonee River's erosion. The formation was first identified as archaeologically important by Increase Lapham, an amateur geologist who is considered Wisconsin's first great scientist. He collected various fossils here in the 1830s, at Schoonmaker Reef in Wauwatosa in the 1840s, and at other sites nearby. Lapham was aware that these blocks of fossil-dense limestone were quite different from the surrounding rock formations, but didn't grasp that these were reefs. Instead he thought they must be remnants of a larger layer of fossil-bearing limestone that had eroded away. A closeup of fossilized reef material. In the 1850s Lapham sent some of his fossils to be identified by paleontologist James Hall in New York. Hall was interested in the finds and visited Milwaukee in the 1850s. Looking at the remnant fossilized coral mound at Soldiers' Home Reef and others like it, Hall noticed their difference from the surrounding flat rocks, and realized that the mounds were not remnants of a larger layer, but were individual reefs. He published this revelation in 1862 - the first identification of fossilized reefs in North America and among the first in the world. It was one of three formations he identified; the other two have since been destroyed by quarrying and other alterations. Further understanding came when Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin noted that each fossilized reef in the area contained a somewhat different community of creatures, in his 1877 Geology of Eastern Wisconsin. He used comparisons of the Soldiers' Home reef and two others nearby to develop models of ancient reef development. The formation continued to be of significant interest to paleontologists until 1939. The two other limestone mounds that helped Lapham, Hall and Chamberlin understand the fossilized reefs have been greatly damaged if not destroyed by quarrying, but Soldiers' Home Reef remains much as when they studied it - still a mound with glacial deposits over fossil-bearing limestone. with See also *National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, Northwestern Branch *Schoonmaker Reef *List of National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin *National Register of Historic Places listings in Milwaukee * References Category:Rock formations of Wisconsin Category:Geography of Milwaukee Category:Landforms of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Category:National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin Category:Natural features on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:Paleontology in Wisconsin Category:Silurian geology of Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Milwaukee ","title":"Soldiers' Home Reef"},{"id":"15011357","text":"The East Siberian brown bear (Ursus arctos collaris) is a population or subspecies of brown bear which ranges from eastern Siberia, beginning at the Yenisei river, north to the Arctic Circle, as far as Trans-Baikaliya, the Stanovoy Range, the Lena River, Kolyma and generally throughout Yakutia and the Altai Mountains. The subspecies is also present in northern Mongolia.  Size  East Siberian bears are intermediate in size to Eurasian brown bears and Kamchatka brown bears, though large individuals can attain the size of the latter. Their skulls are invariably larger than those of Eurasian brown bears and are apparently larger than those of Kamchatka brown bears. Adult males have skulls measuring in length, and wide at the zygomatic arches. They have long, dense and soft fur which is similar in colour to that of Eurasian brown bears, though darker coloured individuals predominate.  Taxonomic history  Originally, Cuvier's trinomial definition for this subspecies was limited to brown bear populations in the upper Yenisei river, in response to bears there sporting well-developed white collars. The subspecies has since been reclassified as encompassing populations formerly classed as jeniseensis and sibiricus, though the latter two lack the collar.

After the final polls, the two top teams were chosen to play in the BCS National Championship Game which determined the BCS national champion team, but not the champion team for independent voting systems (most notably the AP Poll). This format was intended to be \\"bowl-centered\\" rather than a traditional playoff system, since numerous FBS Conferences have expressed their unwillingness to participate in a play-off system. However, due to the unique and often esoteric nature of the BCS format, there had been controversy as to which two teams should play for the national championship and which teams should play in the four other BCS bowl games (Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl, and Sugar Bowl). In this selection process, the BCS was often criticized for conference favoritism, its inequality of access for teams in non-Automatic Qualifying (non-AQ) Conferences (most likely due to perceived strength of schedule), and perceived monopolistic, \\"profit-centered\\" motives. In terms of this last concern, Congress has explored the possibility on more than one occasion of holding hearings to determine the legality of the BCS under the terms of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and the United States Justice Department has also periodically announced interest in investigating the BCS for similar reasons. Overview A survey conducted in 2009 at the Quinnipiac University found that 63% of individuals interested in college football prefer a playoff system to the BCS, while only 26 percent supported the BCS as status quo. Arguments from critics typically center on the validity of BCS national championship pairings and its designated National Champions. Many critics focus strictly on the BCS methodology itself, which employs subjective voting assessments, while others note the ability for undefeated teams to finish seasons without an opportunity to play the national championship game. For example, in the last six seasons of Division I FBS football, there have been more undefeated non-BCS champions than undefeated BCS champions. Other criticisms involve discrepancies in the allocation of monetary resources from BCS games, as well as the determination of non-championship BCS game participants, which need not comply with the BCS rankings themselves. Critics note that other sports and divisions of college football complete seasons without disputed national champions which critics attribute to the use of the playoff format. Critics argue that increasing the number of teams would increase the validity of team comparisons in conferences, which do not compete with one another during the regular season; teams typically only play three or four non-conference games, as the result of pre-determined schedules. BCS proponents view the possibility of expanded competitive post-season opportunities as negative. The primary delivery of this objection is a slippery slope argument rhetorically known as bracket creep. Implementation of a playoff system, proponents object, would lead to other, more serious consequences, such as the diminished value of the regular season, diminished value of the bowl tradition, or damage to the collegiate academic calendar year. Critics, including Republican congressman Joe Barton, have been quick to respond to these red herrings, noting that teams from non- AQ conferences are already excluded from the national championship and their inclusion would only improve the meaningfulness of the regular season. A further criticism of the system is the institutionalized bias towards the six AQ conferences and Notre Dame, an independent team in football, at the deliberate expense of the five Division I-A/FBS BCS non-AQ conferences. Since the inception of the BCS in 1998, 11 non-AQ conference Division I-A/FBS teams have finished the regular season undefeated (Tulane in 1998; Marshall in 1999; Utah in 2004 and 2008; Boise State in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2009; Hawaii in 2007; and TCU in 2009 and 2010) without being given an opportunity to play in the national championship game. (Due to Mid-American Conference bowl tie-ins, the 1999 Marshall team was in danger of not going to any bowl game if it had lost the conference title game, despite its No. 11 final ranking.) Another problem is presented when more than one non-AQ conference team has an undefeated schedule in the same season. In 2008, Utah and Boise State both went undefeated. However, the BCS rules only provide for one automatic at- large BCS berth from teams in the non-AQ conferences. Therefore, a two-loss Ohio State team was chosen over Boise State for the Fiesta Bowl, and Boise State ended up outside of the BCS games. This problem arose again in 2009, with Boise State and TCU undefeated. The final BCS rankings saw TCU at No. 4 and Boise State at No. 6, which meant that only TCU was guaranteed a slot in the BCS bowls. However, the Broncos were not left out of the BCS bowl party this time, as they were chosen to face TCU in the Fiesta Bowl. Nonetheless, both Boise State and TCU finished the regular season unbeaten ‚Äì in the case of Boise State, for the second year in a row, the fourth year out of six, and in 2006 finished as the only undefeated team in the nation ‚Äì and never had a chance to play for a BCS national title. Since, however, teams from non-AQ conferences play what are considered generally easier schedules than teams from AQ conferences, it is unclear whether this \\"bias\\" is merely a penalty based on schedule strength that can also apply to AQ conference teams (see, e.g., the 2007 Kansas team, below). A rejoinder would be that teams from non- AQ conferences only have so much control over their schedules, creating the possibility that such a team might in fact be one of the two best teams in the country, and might also have made a good-faith effort to play a challenging schedule, but might still be excluded from the national championship game. This can happen due to BCS teams turning them down in fear of an upset, or scheduling a traditionally strong school who turned out to be having a weak year. The 2009 TCU team is a counterexample, however. They defeated both Virginia and Clemson on the road, and won the rest of their games by an average of 31 points. They received a BCS bid to play against Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl. Critics, though, argue that but TCU may have been more deserving to play Alabama in the BCS Championship Game than Texas. With wins over Clemson, BYU, and Utah, some journalists, including Football Writers Association of America Past-President Dennis Dodd, have cited the 2009 TCU team as an example of a non-AQ team, excluded from consideration for the national championship in spite of their performance against strong competition. Teams from non-AQ conferences have been successful in BCS bowl games, but this has not affected the position of proponents that non-AQ conference teams are not on an equal level with teams from automatic qualifying conferences. Such \\"BCS Busters\\" have gone 5‚Äì3 in BCS bowl games, and 4‚Äì2 in BCS bowls against teams from AQ conferences: Utah won both its BCS bowl appearances in 2004 and 2008, Boise State won both of its appearances in 2006 and 2009, while TCU won a BCS bowl in 2010 after losing one in 2009 (to Boise State). Northern Illinois lost the Orange Bowl to a tough Florida State team 31-10. In the previous year the Clemson Tigers lost by 37 points to the West Virginia Mountaineers, with lower attendance and television ratings. The only team that could reasonably be described as \\"playing a weak schedule and then being exposed by a BCS team\\" is the 2007 Hawaii team, which was defeated by Georgia in the 2008 Sugar Bowl. Another concern with the BCS is that a team can fail to win its conference championship, but still play in the BCS championship game. This happened in the 2001, 2003, and 2011 seasons. In 2001 Nebraska played Miami (Florida), after a blowout loss to Colorado in the Cornhuskers' final regular-season game and, therefore, did not play in the Big 12 Conference Championship game. In 2003 Oklahoma played LSU despite losing to Kansas State 35‚Äì7 in the Big 12 Conference title game. In 2011, Alabama was selected to play LSU in a rematch between the two programs despite losing the earlier matchup and not winning their division, let alone their conference. This entails that a team that could not even win their conference title is awarded the title of best team in the nation, despite the obvious presence of a better squad within their own conference, as was the case with Alabama in 2011. A rejoinder is that these situations actually reflect a virtue of the BCS system, which rewards teams for their performance throughout the entire season, thereby reinforcing the notion that, in college football, every game (rather than just conference championship games, or games late in the season) matters. A similar criticism is that a team with similar or better arguments to another team can be left out of the BCS despite beating the other team. This happened between Miami (Florida) and Florida State University in 2000, where Miami beat Florida St. yet Florida St. went to the National Championship Game. The University of Washington also beat Miami and finished with an 11‚Äì1 record, further adding to the controversy. In 2008, the situation was repeated when one-loss Oklahoma was selected for the BCS Championship over one-loss Texas, which beat the Sooners during the regular season. Although not related to the title game, after the 2007 season, Kansas was chosen to go to the BCS Orange Bowl, even though they had lost to Missouri (who went to the non-BCS Cotton Bowl, despite only losing twice to Oklahoma, and being ranked higher than both Kansas and Big Ten Rose Bowl Representative Illinois, who Missouri beat). This, among other games in history, illustrates that late season losses are often more injurious than early season losses. Finally, critics argue that a team can win a weak conference and be awarded an automatic berth over at- large teams that are perceived to be more deserving. Most of this criticism has centered on the Big East after losing Miami, Virginia Tech, and Boston College to the ACC. In 2004, No. 21 Pittsburgh won the Big East with a record of 8‚Äì3 and was awarded an automatic bid because they won their conference at the expense of several runner-up teams with much better rankings, such as No. 5 California, No. 7 Georgia, and No. 8 Virginia Tech, that were left out. In 2008, undefeated No. 9 Boise State and No. 11 TCU were left out of the BCS while No. 19 Virginia Tech, winner of the ACC was given a BCS bowl berth. In 2010, Connecticut won the Big East with a record of 8‚Äì4 and was awarded an automatic bid to the Fiesta Bowl despite not being ranked in the top 25 of the BCS standings. As a result, the Mountain West Conference campaigned to receive an automatic bid while there have been calls for the Big East to lose its AQ status. Another way to fix this problem would be to mandate that if a conference champion finishes with a low ranking (say below 12) that they forfeit their automatic bid, and get put into the pool of \\"at large\\" teams that the BCS can choose from. Thus, a higher ranked non-AQ team (or an extra team from other AQ conferences) could be selected by a bowl game. Another solution to this problem that is being heavily considered when the current BCS agreement ends is to get rid of the AQ status and allow the bowl committees to select the participants they want provided that the school has a sufficiently high BCS ranking so that no BCS bowl will be forced to take a low-ranking AQ conference champion. This will also allow a third team from the same conference to participate in a BCS bowl, something that is prohibited by the current rules. Questions regarding disparities in revenue sharing In addition to concerns about the inclusion of non-AQ (Automatic Qualifying) conference teams in the five BCS bowls, some critics have noted the disparities between the amounts paid to the six AQ conferences and their respective schools, as opposed to other conferences and their own schools. The official BCS website discusses the payouts for the 2009‚Äì2010 BCS bowls.http://a.espncdn.com/i/ncf/bcs/bcsguide2010b.pdf *Since each AQ conference is guaranteed at least one representative to a BCS game, each conference will receive approximately $21.2 million, plus an additional $6 million should a second conference team be selected. Although each conference has its own arrangement for the distribution of these funds, the average income per school in each conference is as follows (One team selected/Two teams selected): **Atlantic Coast (14 teams): $1.767M / $2.667M **American Athletic (12 teams): $2.650M / $3.400M **Big Ten (12 teams): $1.927M / $2.473M **Big 12 (10 teams): $1.767M / $2.667M **Pacific-10 (12 teams): $2.120M / $2.720M **Southeastern (14 teams): $1.767M / $2.667M **With next season's realignment in the Big Ten, Big 12, and Pacific-10 (to be renamed the Pac-12) conferences, these numbers will be adjusted. *Notre Dame is guaranteed 1/74th of net revenues, or approximately $1.7 million. If selected to play in a BCS bowl, Notre Dame will receive $6 million. *Independent programs Army and Navy will each receive $100,000 for allowing their teams to participate in the selection for BCS bowls. *Nine percent, or approximately $12.35 million, is guaranteed in aggregate to Conference USA, the Mid-American, Mountain West, Sun Belt, and Western Athletic conferences. If a team from one of these five conferences plays in a BCS bowl, an additional nine percent (approximately $12.35M) will be given in aggregate to the conferences, and if a second team participates, those conferences will receive an additional $6.0M. These five conferences are composed of a total of 52 teams, broken down as follows: **Conference USA ‚Äì 14 teams **Mid-American ‚Äì 13 teams **Mountain West ‚Äì 12 teams **Sun Belt ‚Äì 11 teams *Therefore, if the payouts to these conferences were broken down equally per school (which is not the case), this would amount to an average of $237,500 per school. If one team from these conferences were to play in a BCS game, that figure would increase to $519,231 per school. Should two teams be selected, the average per school would rise to $634,615 per school. As a result, in the best-case scenario schools from the non-AQ conferences would receive approximately 37% of the least of the schools in the AQ conferences, including Notre Dame. These numbers are not the actual amounts paid to each school, but are averaged over the total number of schools. *Each of the 14 conferences in the Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA), will receive $250,000, or a total of $3.5M. The FCS subdivision, consists of 122 football programs in 14 conferences, with 7 schools independent. (It is unclear if the independent schools are included in the BCS payout.) As a result, although the actual distribution will vary significantly, each of the 122 schools will receive an average of $28,689. This represents 1/56th of the amount that Notre Dame (the team with the lowest guaranteed amount) would receive, and 1/209th of the amount that Notre Dame would receive if it receives a BCS bid. *A breakdown of the BCS non-AQ revenue sharing conducted in 2010 shows the total amounts that the five non-AQ conferences received from all bowls. The coalition of C-USA, MAC, MWC, Sun Belt, and WAC conferences divides half of the BCS revenue equally amongst the five conferences, and the other half into 15 equal shares which are divided by performance. Since Boise State and TCU participated in the Fiesta Bowl, the coalition grossed a total of $24M. As a result, the conferences received and divided the following income (average per school, which likely do not reflect actual amounts, are in parentheses): **MWC ‚Äì $9.8M ($1,088,889) **WAC ‚Äì $7.8M ($866,667) **C-USA ‚Äì $2.8M ($233,333) **MAC ‚Äì $2.1M ($161,538) **Sun Belt ‚Äì $1.5M ($166,667) *The 2008‚Äì2009 BCS Media Guide claims that over the first 10 years of the BCS arrangement, a total of $100 million has been given to the then-50 non-AQ conference Football Bowl Subdivision schools and the 122 Football Championship Subdivision schools. This gives an average of $10M/year, or $58,803 per school year. By comparison, each AQ conference (between eight and twelve schools) is guaranteed $18 million this year, an average of $1.66M per school for the 65 participating institutions. The disparities between AQ conferences and non-AQ conferences continue outside the Bowl Championship Series to other bowls, but since the payouts for the five BCS bowls are so much greater than other bowls, the BCS has a major impact on revenue distribution paid to the various Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) schools. A 2003 study described the disparities between the different schools. In 2003, there were 24 bowls other than the BCS bowls, creating opportunities for 48 teams to participate in bowl games. Of these 48 teams, 33 were from AQ conferences. *In 2003, the Big Ten led all conferences with $31.9 million from its seven bowl appearances. By comparison, Conference USA, which led the non-AQ conferences with five bowl appearances, brought in a total of $5.75 million. TCU led all non-AQ schools with $1.37 million from its Liberty bowl appearance. *A similar study of 2000‚Äì2010 bowls shows that the SEC led all conferences with $40.46M from its ten bowl appearances. By comparison, the Mountain West Conference led all non-AQ conferences with $12.9M from its five bowls, including TCU's Fiesta Bowl appearance. *The BCS itself acknowledges the vast discrepancies between conferences the automatically qualify (AQ conferences) by drawing a comparison between BCS and non-BCS bowls. On their website, it notes that as a result of Utah's 2009 Sugar Bowl appearance, the MWC received $9.8 million. In contrast, the largest payout of any AQ- conference contracted bowl is the MAACO Bowl Las Vegas, which pays the two teams a total of $1.8 million. The conclusion from this is that the Sugar Bowl paid the MWC over 10 times the best of what a non-BCS bowl offered. Should Utah not have been offered the bid, the MWC would have suffered considerably in comparison. As a result, there has been significant criticism regarding the revenue distribution by bowls, specifically the BCS due to its significantly higher payout to participating teams. This disparity coupled with the comparative difficulty for non-AQ conference teams to participate in BCS bowls, compounded by the uneven split even for non-AQ conference teams competing in a BCS bowl, have raised calls for further reform in the revenue distribution structure. These concerns have also called into question the underlying motivations of the BCS, insofar as revenue is concerned. These issues have been the center of some Congressional inquiries, the threat of a lawsuit by the Attorney General of Utah, and a recent law review article in the Harvard Journal of Sports and Entertainment Law concluding that the BCS violates federal antitrust law. Finally, these figures cannot describe the vast differences in merchandise and other revenue that schools receive based on participating in higher visibility games, such as the BCS bowls. Controversies by season=1998‚Äì99 season= The first year of the BCS ended in controversy when one-loss Kansas State finished third in the final BCS standings, but were passed over for participation in BCS games in favor of Ohio State (ranked 4th) and two-loss Florida (8th). Instead, the Wildcats played in the less prestigious Alamo Bowl against Purdue. That offseason, the BCS adopted the \\"Kansas State Rule\\", which provides that the 3rd ranked team (or 4th ranked team if the 3rd ranked team has already qualified as a conference champion) in the final BCS standings is assured an invitation to a BCS game. The rule was first utilized in 2002‚Äì03, giving an automatic berth to USC. The rule was used eight times in all, with Texas earning automatic bids in 2004‚Äì05 and 2008‚Äì09, Ohio State earning an automatic bid in 2005‚Äì06, Michigan receiving an automatic bid in 2006‚Äì07, Stanford receiving an automatic bid in 2010‚Äì11 and 2011‚Äì12, Florida receiving an automatic bid in 2012‚Äì13, and Alabama receiving an automatic bid in 2013‚Äì14. The year also provided the first hint of the inherent bias in the system, with Tulane going undefeated yet due to their conference affiliation winding up just 10th in the final BCS rankings and being ignored for a potential at-large bid. =1999‚Äì2000 season= In the second year of the BCS, Kansas State finished 6th in the BCS standings, but once again received no invitation, instead being passed over in favor of Michigan (ranked 8th). Kansas State's predicament (as well as that of undefeated Tulane the previous year and undefeated Marshall who was denied this year) inaugurated the long-standing media controversies regarding the system. Michigan was also picked ahead of in-state and Big Ten rival Michigan State (ranked 9th), despite the Spartans defeating the Wolverines that year (34-31). Michigan, a perceived national brand team, passing up Kansas State and Michigan State led to allegations that the BCS favored paydays over athletic integrity. =2000‚Äì01 season= Florida State (11‚Äì1, ACC Champions) was chosen to play undefeated Oklahoma (12‚Äì0, Big 12 champions) in the Orange Bowl for the national championship, despite their one loss coming to another one-loss team, the Miami Hurricanes (10‚Äì1, Big East champions), who were ranked No. 2 in both human polls. Adding to the controversy, Miami's one loss came to yet another one loss team, the Pac-10 champion Washington Huskies, leaving three teams with a legitimate claim to play Oklahoma in the National Championship game. Florida State lost to Oklahoma 13‚Äì2, while Washington and Miami both easily won their BCS games, adding more fuel to the fire. Washington beat Purdue 34-24 in the Rose Bowl, and Miami beat Florida 37-20 in the Sugar Bowl. As a result of the controversy, the BCS was tweaked in the off-season: a \\"quality-win\\" bonus was added to the formula, giving extra credit for beating a top ten team. =2001‚Äì02 season= In another controversial season, Nebraska was chosen as a national title game participant despite being ranked No. 4 in both human polls and not winning their conference. The Huskers went into their final regular season game at Colorado undefeated, but left Boulder with a 62‚Äì36 loss, and Colorado went on to win the Big 12 championship. However, the BCS computers, which contributed to 50% of the rankings, did not take into account time of loss, so one-loss Nebraska came out ahead of two-loss Colorado and one-loss Oregon, the consensus No. 2 in both human polls (but 4th in the BCS). In the end, Nebraska beat Colorado for the No. 2 spot in the BCS poll by .05 points. Nebraska was routed in the national title game, 37‚Äì14, by Miami. Similarly, Oregon dominated Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl, 38‚Äì16. As a result, the computer's influence in determining the rankings was reduced from 50% to 33.3%, and the human poll ranking increased to 66.6%. =2002‚Äì03 season= The 2002-03 season was not controversial for the championship game selections or non-AQ selection to the BCS bowl games, but for the BCS allegedly ruining Bowl traditions that had gone way back before the BCS' existence. The Rose Bowl traditionally features the champions of the Big Ten and the Pac-10. However, Big Ten co-champion Ohio State, finishing No. 2 in the BCS, had qualified to play in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl for the national championship against Big East champion Miami. After the national championship was set, the Orange Bowl had the next pick, and invited No. 3 (#5 BCS) Iowa, who had shared the Big Ten title with Ohio State. When it was the Rose Bowl's turn to select, the best available team was No. 8 (#7 BCS) Oklahoma, the Big 12 champion. When it came time for the Orange Bowl and Sugar Bowl to make a second pick, both wanted Pac-10 co-champion USC. However, a BCS rule stated that if two bowls wanted the same team, the bowl with the higher payoff had priority.Rosenblatt, Richard ‚Äì BCS: Orange Bowl has a Rosy look Associated Press, December 9, 2002 The Orange Bowl immediately extended an at-large bid to the Trojans and paired them with the Hawkeyes in a Big Ten/Pac-10 \\"Rose Bowl East\\" matchup in the 2003 Orange Bowl. The Rose Bowl was left to pair Oklahoma with Pac-10 co- champion Washington State. Rose Bowl committee executive director Mitch Dorger was not pleased with the results, and the 2003 Rose Bowl game had the lowest attendance and first non-sellout since 1944. This was the second consecutive Rose Bowl to not feature the Big Ten and Pac 10 together, as the previous seasons bowl was the championship game, the first time the Rose Bowl did not feature their 2 respective conferences since 1918 and 1919. It was only the 2nd time this had ever happened in the Rose Bowl's history. The Rose Bowl ended with Oklahoma thumping Washington State 34-14, and the Orange Bowl ended with USC whacking Iowa 38-17. As for the Sugar Bowl, there was no controversy surrounding it, as SEC Champion Georgia and ACC Champion Florida State were paired together, with Georgia winning the game 26-13. Meanwhile, Ohio State upset Miami in the Fiesta Bowl, 31-24, to win the national championship and finished as the only undefeated team in the nation, completing the first 14-0 season in college football history. =2003‚Äì04 season= The 2003‚Äì04 season saw three schools from BCS AQ conferences finishing the season with one loss (in fact, no Division I-A team finished the season undefeated, something that hadn't happened since 1996, two years before the advent of the BCS). The three schools in question were Oklahoma, LSU and USC. USC was ranked No. 1 in both human polls, but were burdened by a 2.67 computer ranking due to a weaker schedule and one defeatto unranked Californiaduring the regular season. Meanwhile, Oklahoma had a perfect undefeated regular season playing a stronger schedule, then lost to a strong No. 8-ranked Kansas State in the Big 12 Championship Game, 35-7. The Sooners had been ranked first in both the human polls and the BCS rankings going into the conference playoff week, but dropped to No. 3 in the human polls after the loss to the Wildcats. The Sooners were still ranked first in the computer rankings by a large enough margin to give the Sooners the top spot in the final BCS rankings (the computer rankings didn't take time of loss into account). LSU earned the second spot based on a stronger computer ranking than USC and a No. 2 human poll ranking, and went on to claim the BCS championship with a 21‚Äì14 win over Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl. USC instead went to the Rose Bowl, where they easily defeated Big Ten champion Michigan (No. 4), and the AP proclaimed the Trojans as national champions. The split in the polls left many LSU (13‚Äì1) and USC (12‚Äì1) fans displeased. The college coaches involved in the Coaches Poll were contractually obligated to award their organization's trophy and first place votes to the winner of the BCS championship game, LSU. However, for the first time in the history of the BCS, the BCS Champion was not unanimous. LSU received 60 first-place votes, while USC garnered three. The three coaches who broke ranks and violated their contractual obligation and voted against LSU for the national champion were Lou Holtz of South Carolina, along with two coaches from the conferences that played in that year‚Äôs Rose BowlMike Bellotti of the Pac-10's Oregon and Ron Turner of the Big Ten's Illinois. =2004‚Äì05 season=Undefeated teams The 2004‚Äì05 regular season finished with five undefeated teams for the first time since 1979. Despite having perfect records, Auburn, Utah and Boise State were denied an opportunity to play for the BCS championship. Utah and Boise State's schedules were thought of as weaker than Auburn's (by virtue of playing in the weaker Mountain West and WAC, respectively). However, Utah was the first BCS non-AQ conference team to ever play in a BCS game. Much of the debate centered on No. 3 Auburn, who went undefeated in the SEC, leading to debates over the strength of schedule, a value that was diminished in the BCS before the season. In the championship game, Oklahoma was crushed by USC, 55‚Äì19. Meanwhile, Auburn defeated ACC Champion No. 9 Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl 16‚Äì13, and No. 6 Utah demolished Big East champion No. 21 Pittsburgh in the Fiesta Bowl, 35‚Äì7. This left 3 undefeated teams at the end of the season, with Auburn finishing at No. 2 and Utah at No. 4, and once again leaving many voters wondering who the real champion was. Lobbying for votes Another controversy occurred this season when voters jumped Texas over California in the final regular-season poll. Texas coach Mack Brown publicly lobbied voters to give Texas the final at-large bid. Although the Bears, as Pac-10 runner-up, normally would have had first crack at a Rose Bowl berth, Brown lobbied for and got that berth. Several Associated Press voters were besieged by fan emails and phone calls attempting to sway their votes, apparently spurred from Brown's pleas to rank Texas ahead of other \\"less deserving teams.\\" California's cause was hurt when it was less than impressive in a 26‚Äì16 victory over 24-point underdog Southern Miss in Hattiesburg, Mississippi the night before bowl bids were extended. Nine of the 65 AP voters moved Texas ahead of Cal, and three of them were from Texas. In the Coaches Poll, four voters moved Cal down to No. 7 and two to No. 8, when the week before none had them lower than No. 6. Meanwhile, two coaches moved Texas up to No. 3, even though they did not play that week. The Los Angeles Times wrote that accusations were raised about manipulated voting, but the individual votes were not released to prove or disprove the allegations. In the end, Texas gained 23 points on Cal in the AP Poll, and 43 points in the Coaches Poll. This allowed Texas to earn a BCS berth, finishing .0129 points ahead of Cal in the BCS standings after being .0013 points behind. In the Rose Bowl, Texas rallied to defeat Big Ten champion Michigan in a thriller, 38-37. Following the game, Brown was heavily criticized for his lobbying of votes, while Cal coach Jeff Tedford called for all votes to be released to the public. The Golden Bears lost to Texas Tech in the Holiday Bowl, 45-31, hurting their cause. Cal played without two of the highest performing receivers in the NCAA,\\"Wounded Cal could use a hand at receiver\\", Union- Tribune, December 29, 2004, ; however, their loss was attributed in many press reports to the Bears' disappointment over being denied their first Rose Bowl appearance in 45 years. As a result of two straight years of controversy, the Associated Press removed its poll from the BCS formula, instead choosing to give out its own national championship trophy. The AP Poll was replaced by the Harris Interactive Poll the following year. Reggie Bush improper benefits scandal In the years following USC's 2004 season BCS title, it emerged that former Trojan running back Reggie Bush, who played for the team in 2004 (and 2005), had received illegal gifts in violation of NCAA rules. The subsequent NCAA investigation confirmed this, and the Trojan football program was hit with severe sanctions in the summer of 2010. Among these were the vacating of the last two wins of 2004 (including the Orange Bowl) and all wins in 2005 (they lost the Rose Bowl to Texas). After USC's appeal was denied, the BCS officially stripped them of the 2004 BCS title in 2011 and left the title for that year vacant. =2006‚Äì07 season= Going into the final poll, undefeated Boise State and four one-loss teams (Louisville, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida) were up for a spot against undefeated Ohio State in the BCS National Championship game. Louisville (11‚Äì1, Big East champions), and Boise State were given less consideration because of a perceived lack of schedule strength, while Wisconsin (11‚Äì1) was two steps removed from Ohio State (they lost to Michigan, who lost to Ohio State, and Wisconsin and Ohio State did not play). Michigan lost to Ohio State 42‚Äì39 in the regular season finale (giving the Buckeyes the Big Ten championship), but were still ranked ahead of Florida and behind USC going into the final ballot. Florida defeated Arkansas in the SEC Championship Game, and No. 2 USC lost to UCLA, leaving Michigan and Florida as one-loss teams who both claimed they deserved to play for the national championship. Ultimately, Florida passed Michigan into the No. 2 spot by a mere .0101 points. This small difference was a result of the human polls (USA Today's Coaches' Poll and Harris Interactive Poll) ranking Florida above Michigan, while the computer polls had the two teams tied for second. Michigan, which was automatically guaranteed an at-large berth by virtue of its No. 3 ranking, went to the Rose Bowl, which they lost to USC 32‚Äì18. Florida won the national championship by impressively beating Ohio State, 41‚Äì14. Florida received all but one of the 65 first-place votes in the final Associated Press poll (the other went to Boise State, who won the Fiesta Bowl over Oklahoma). At the conclusion of the season, Wisconsin and Louisville both finished the season with one loss, while Boise State was the only undefeated team in the nation. Because of a BCS rule allowing only two teams from each conference to play in BCS bowl games, highly ranked Wisconsin and Auburn were not eligible for selection to a BCS game. Wisconsin was excluded because Ohio State and Michigan represented the Big Ten, and Auburn was excluded because LSU and Florida represented the SEC, even though Auburn defeated LSU 7‚Äì3 and Florida 27‚Äì17 during the season. LSU earned the at-large bid on the strength of its 31‚Äì26 victory over SEC West champion Arkansas, while the Razorbacks defeated then No. 2 Auburn 27‚Äì10 on the road. Auburn's 37‚Äì15 loss at home to a reeling Georgia team also ended its chances at the BCS. An omission of the rule still would have not have been enough for Auburn to secure a berth, as Wisconsin would have likely been the final at-large bid. The final BCS poll had seven teams from the SEC and the Big Ten ranked in the top twelve, but by the rule only two from each conference were eligible to play in BCS games, offering the opportunity to argue that both conferences are over-ranked, that the Big Ten schedule does not produce a true conference champion, or that the limit of 2 teams from any one conference is inappropriate. =2007‚Äì08 season= In a season full of upsets, the top two teams in the polls lost on the same weekend each of the final two weeks, sending the BCS into chaos heading into the selection of the two teams to play for the national championship. On November 23, top-ranked LSU lost in triple overtime to Arkansas. This was the Tigers' second triple-overtime loss of the season, with the other to Kentucky. The following day, No. 4 Missouri beat No. 2 Kansas and took the top spot in the BCS for the following week. This created the interesting prospect of No. 1 Missouri playing its final game of the season as three-point underdogs against Oklahoma. On December 1, Missouri was defeated by Oklahoma in the Big 12 Championship Game. No. 2 West Virginia was also stunned at home by unranked Pittsburgh in the annual Backyard Brawl game. Meanwhile, Ohio State, who was idle for the final two weeks, climbed the rankings from No. 5 to No. 1. Hawaii capped off an undefeated season (the only such team going into the bowl season), beating Washington and securing a BCS appearance for the first time in school history. However, as with Boise State in the previous season, Hawaii did not play for the BCS Championship because the Warriors' schedule was deemed too weak, adding to the ongoing controversy regarding the subjectivity and how easy it is to manipulate the strength of schedule element in determining rankings. In fact, with Hawaii's loss in the Sugar Bowl, the 2007‚Äì08 season was the first since the 2003‚Äì04 season (and only the second in the BCS era) with no teams finishing the entire season undefeated. In another irony, No. 6 Missouri was shut out of the BCS entirely when No. 8 Kansas was selected as one of three at-large teams. The Tigers finished higher in the BCS standings and had defeated the Jayhawks a week before the Big 12 title game. However, Kansas received a bid to the Orange Bowl; Orange Bowl officials said that they picked Kansas because the Jayhawks had only one loss, while Missouri had two losses, both to Big 12 champion Oklahoma. Since BCS rules did not allow more than two teams from one conference to get a bid, Missouri was denied an at-large bid because of Kansas' invitation to the Orange Bowl and Oklahoma's invitation to the Fiesta Bowl. Instead, Missouri crushed Arkansas 38‚Äì7 in the Cotton Bowl. Kansas stunned No. 3 Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl 24‚Äì21, and Oklahoma was trounced by West Virginia 48-28 in the Fiesta Bowl, making no clear argument either way. Before \\"Championship Saturday\\", LSU was ranked No. 7 and Georgia was No. 4. However, after No. 1 Missouri and No. 2 West Virginia lost, LSU was catapulted to No. 2 based on a 21‚Äì14 win over No. 14 Tennessee in the SEC Championship Game. Many argued that the Bulldogs should not play for the national title because they didn't play for‚Äîlet alone win‚Äîthe SEC Championship. ESPN's Kirk Herbstreit served as point man for the attack on the Bulldogs, ironically one year after pleading for an Ohio State-Michigan rematch after the Wolverines failed to win their conference. The Bulldogs and Vols finished with identical 6‚Äì2 records atop the SEC East, but Tennessee represented the division in the championship game by virtue of beating Georgia 35‚Äì14 in October. Virginia Tech had been ranked No. 6, above LSU, but had to settle for the No. 3 slot, despite a convincing win over No. 11 Boston College in the ACC Championship Game. Voters were likely influenced by LSU's crushing 48‚Äì7 defeat of Virginia Tech early in the season. Computer rankings placed Virginia Tech (0.960) and LSU (0.950) No. 1, and No. 2, respectively. The top four teams in the BCS standings were No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 LSU, No. 3 Virginia Tech, and No. 4 Oklahoma. Ultimately, LSU defeated Ohio State 38‚Äì24, marking the second straight season that the Buckeyes lost the championship game to an SEC opponent. LSU received 60 of a possible 65 first-place votes in the final AP poll, the fewest for a BCS champion since 2004. Georgia, another SEC team, was second in the poll and received three first-place votes. The final two first place votes went USC and Kansas, ranked No. 3 and No. 7 respectively. =2008‚Äì09 season= In the Big 12 South division, there was a three-way tie for the division champion between Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas Tech (all one-loss teams). The winner of that division would likely play in the national championship game if it beat Missouri in the Big 12 Championship Game. Oklahoma lost to Texas 45‚Äì35, then Texas lost to Texas Tech 39‚Äì33, and then Texas Tech lost to Oklahoma 65‚Äì21. In the Big 12, the BCS standings were used to break this tie, causing the teams to jockey for votes in the human polls. In the end, Oklahoma edged out Texas for the right to represent the Big 12 South in the conference championship game. Despite the head-to-head loss to the Longhorns earlier in the season, the computer rankings ranked the Sooners' schedule ahead of the Longhorns. Another BCS AQ conference, the SEC, merely uses the BCS standings to eliminate one team in a three-way tie and then use head to head to determine tiebreakers, which would have worked in Texas' favor.\\"Using the SEC model, if Oklahoma wins out, the Sooners and Texas Tech would probably be eliminated in a three-way tie. Texas would probably get the nod to play for the Big 12 championship by virtue of its 45‚Äì35 victory over Oklahoma on Oct. 11. Using the Big 12 model, Oklahoma's chances would be much better.\\" Fit to be tied? Big 12 tie-breaker could determine national championship game berth , Birmingham News Going into the conference championship games, only four teams‚ÄîAlabama, Utah, Ball State and Boise State‚Äîwere undefeated. However, in the event of an Alabama loss, Utah, Ball State and Boise State had no chance at a title game berth because their schedules were deemed too weak, once again igniting a controversy about schedule strength. As it turned out, Alabama lost to one-loss Florida in the SEC Championship Game, vaulting the Gators to the second spot in the final BCS rankings and a matchup in the title game against Oklahoma. Alabama fell to fourth, behind Texas. In addition, Ball State lost the MAC championship to Buffalo, which denied any chance they had at getting a BCS berth. Utah and Boise State both finished in the top 15 of the BCS standings and were thus eligible for BCS at-large spots. It was generally understood, however, that only one team would get a berth, as it would be hard to justify allowing a second mid-major conference team into a BCS bowl over an AQ conference runner- up. This difficulty in \\"justifying\\" both non-automatic qualifying teams going to BCS bowls led a number of BCS critics to point to this situation as being reflective of the arrogance and assumption of higher quality of the AQ conferences that is not borne out by any statistics or their win-loss records, but rather is based on past records and reputations. Utah qualified automatically as the highest ranked (in the top 12) non-AQ conference champion and defeated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. No. 9 Boise State and No. 11 TCU were matched up in the Poinsettia Bowl, marking the first time in history that a bowl featured two teams from non-AQ conferences ranked higher than both participants in a BCS bowl game in the same season (the Orange Bowl matched No. 12 Cincinnati and No. 19 Virginia Tech). TCU defeated Boise State 17‚Äì16, and Utah won the Sugar Bowl to finish as the nation's only undefeated team and ranked No. 2 in the AP poll. After the season, the Mountain West Conference made a proposal at the BCS commissioners' annual spring meetings that a selection committee replace the polls and computers, an eight-team playoff system put in place, and changes to the automatic qualifier rules.Chris Dufresne, Mountain West Conference takes a radical tack, Los Angeles Times, April 22, 2009 On June 24, 2009, the BCS presidential oversight committee rejected the plan.College football: BCS presidents reject playoff plan, Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2009 =2009‚Äì10 season= By mid-October, it was clear that Florida and Alabama would face off in the 2009 SEC Championship Game, and the winner would play in the BCS title game. It was also generally believed that Texas would get the other spot if it won the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game, despite concerns about a weak non-conference schedule and a surprising lack of quality teams in the Big 12. Ultimately, in a repeat of the 2004‚Äì05 season, five teams finished the season undefeated‚ÄîAlabama, Texas, Cincinnati, TCU, and Boise State. Going into the final weekend of the regular season, it was already certain that at least two teams would finish undefeated due to the SEC title game matchup between Alabama and Florida, as well as TCU having already completed an undefeated season. Texas won the Big 12 title game, and with it a spot in the BCS title game, in controversial fashion. As the game clock appeared to run out with Nebraska winning 12‚Äì10; officials ruled that the time left on the clock was reviewable and ordered 1 second put back on the clock, allowing the Longhorns to kick a field goal for a 13‚Äì12 win, a result that left then-Nebraska coach Bo Pelini claiming that it was part of a BCS conspiracy.Dirk Chatelain, , Omaha World-Herald, December 5, 2009 Earlier, Alabama trounced Florida in the SEC title game to earn the other slot. Boise State, Cincinnati and TCU all believed they had a chance at being in the championship game if Texas lost. However, despite a convincing season-opening win over eventual Pac-10 champion Oregon, Boise State's schedule was once again deemed too weak for a spot in the title game. TCU also thought it would have a shot, since by this time the Mountain West had been reckoned as the strongest non-AQ conference. Cincinnati, however, probably had the strongest claim of the three. Despite being ranked behind TCU going into championship weekend, the Bearcats were the undefeated champion of an AQ conference, rather than an at-large team like the Horned Frogs or Broncos. Indeed, any realistic chance of Boise State or TCU getting in the title game ended with Cincinnati's season-ending victory over Pittsburgh, which ensured that at least two teams from AQ conferences (Cincinnati and the SEC champion) would finish undefeated. Cincinnati passed TCU to finish 3rd in the final BCS standings, but with the margin as slim as it was and three of the six BCS computers having placed Texas behind Cincinnati but ahead of TCU, no conclusions can be drawn as to what might have happened if Texas had lost. Cincinnati was routed by Florida in the Sugar Bowl, 51-24, while Alabama won the national title over Texas, 37-21. Non-AQ Bowl Selection Controversy Unrelated to the title game was the controversy regarding the bowl selections. While at No. 6, Boise State was able to earn an at-large berth, the announcement that they would be playing No. 4 TCU in the Fiesta Bowl caused a massive outcry and also focused the controversy on the broader issue of truly fair access to Bowl opportunities, rather than just appearances. As the two \\"BCS Busters\\" would be matched up against each other and would thereby be denied the opportunity to face a top team from one of the six BCS AQ conferences, instead providing a rematch of a non-BCS bowl from the previous year (see above), the BCS came off looking \\"at best, a cowardly cartel\\".Paraphrasing Rep. Joe Barton, (R)-Texas speaking to the Fort Worth Star Telegram Placing two teams from non-AQ conferences in the same bowl also contradicted the previous assertion that non-AQ schools are less likely to receive at-large bids because the bowls prefer the superior drawing power of the big schools and their highly mobile fanbases‚Äîhence undefeated Boise State's omission from the BCS the previous year in favor of two-loss Ohio State. For this reason, some were calling this match up the \\"Separate but Equal Bowl\\", or the \\"Fiasco Bowl.\\" The issue of far more consequence brought to the fore as a result of this game was that of access to equal and fair competition, the access to the chance to compete for and win the \\"Big Game\\" in the first place. There was a tremendous amount of criticism surrounding the 2010 Fiesta Bowl team pairing. Many argued that the BCS was terrified of a BCS non-AQ conference team defeating a BCS AQ conference team and bringing into question ever more starkly the entire premise of the BCS's existence, that teams from AQ conferences are somehow superior to non-AQ conference teams and are therefore more deserving to play for the \\"National Championship\\". A defeat of a top ranked AQ conference team would help affirm that this premise was false ‚Äì as the impressive record of non-AQ teams in BCS Bowls (4‚Äì2 against BCS AQ teams) already hints at. Consequently, the BCS paired TCU and BSU together so that the possibility of an embarrassment of an AQ school, and by extension the entire system's validity, was eliminated. Boise State ended up beating TCU in the Fiesta Bowl, 17-10. =2010‚Äì11 season= During TCU's second undefeated regular season run in a row (their only loss being the 2010 Fiesta Bowl against Boise State), and while Boise State was still undefeated prior to losing to Nevada, E. Gordon Gee, the president of Ohio State and formerly president of two other BCS AQ conference schools, made public comments to the Associated Press stating that schools from BCS non-AQ conferences should not be allowed to compete for the BCS Championship. \\"I do know, having been both a Southeastern Conference president and a Big Ten president, that it's like murderer's row every week for these schools. We do not play the Little Sisters of the Poor. We play very fine schools on any given day. So I think until a university runs through that gauntlet that there's some reason to believe that they not be the best teams to [be] in the big ballgame.\\" These comments sparked immediate criticism from commentators, coaches from non-AQ conferences and much of the general public. Ironically, TCU went on to win the Rose Bowl over Wisconsin (who had defeated the Buckeyes earlier in the season), and billboards appeared in the Columbus area congratulating TCU on its win that were signed by \\"The Little Sisters of the Poor\\" as a jibe to Dr. Gee's remarks. He nominally apologized for after the game, and later performed community service at a nursing home operated by a convent group known Little Sisters of the Poor, although he added that he had no idea they existed when he made the comments. The 2010 season found three teams, Oregon, Auburn and TCU all with undefeated records. The teams from the two automatic qualifying conferences, Oregon (Pac-10) and Auburn (SEC), were selected over the Horned Frogs for the 2011 National Championship game due to TCU's weak strength of schedule. Auburn defeated Oregon for the title, 22-19. At this point, the controversy surrounding the BCS became a topic of conversation within the United States government. In 2008 U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) had said that he would hold congressional hearings on the BCS in the future after his Utah team failed to play in the national championship game. Following up on Senator Hatch's actions in the Senate, in April 2011 the Attorney General of Utah announced that he would be initiating a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, despite the fact that Utah is joining to the Pacific-10 Conference, which is an automatic qualifying conference. In May 2011 the U.S. Justice Department sent a letter to the NCAA asking for a detailed explanation about why FBS football was the only NCAA sport that the NCAA did not 1) have a playoff system in place to determine a champion and 2) why the NCAA had abrogated its responsibility to do so and given the authority to determine the NCAA Champion to an outside group such as the BCS. The Justice Department's investigation and Utah Attorney General's lawsuit are both aimed at forcing the BCS to open its books, which they are as a non-profit required to do every year and have never done, and at determining whether the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel based on Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914 and the Robinson-Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act. Two more states Attorneys General are said to be considering joining the Utah lawsuit, and the investigation by the Justice Department will probably include a minute and extensive examination of the Fiesta Bowl Scandal as well as conducting complete audits of the other BCS Bowls, the BCS itself and possibly even the schools of the 6 BCS Automatic Qualification Conferences. The Fiesta Bowl scandal in particular was the catalyst that opened the BCS up to Federal interest for the first time, largely because the government is concerned not only about the BCS's stifling of fair competition, but more importantly for the Federal Government about the possibility of fraud and tax evasion, if the BCS has violated the rules governing tax exempt organizations and groups that control tax exempt organizations. If the BCS Bowls, who are each separate entities yet also part of the BCS as a whole as well were to lose their tax exempt status, they could be liable for back taxes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The Fiesta Bowl abuses ‚Äì especially those regarding alleged illegal and improper political contributions, excessive executive compensation and unjustified reimbursement payments, and the making of excessive, interest free and un-repaid loans ‚Äì are precisely the types of abuses that would justify the Internal Revenue Service in stripping the BCS, and each BCS Bowl and possibly even each AQ conference school (although that is highly unlikely) of their tax exempt status. In the worst-case scenario the BCS could also be subject to forfeiture and seizure proceedings. While the worst penalties are unlikely to be enforced, even the milder penalties, such as a determination of a cartel and trust, would have devastating consequences for the BCS and the current system. The court could also order a resolution of the current unfair competition inherent in the structure of the BCS, including ordering a playoff system and ordering the Bowls to participate. Despite Big 10 Commissioner Delaney's assertion that if the BCS were to fold they would \\"go back to the old system\\"Interview with ESPN if a court ordered a solution the Conferences would have no choice in the matter, and would be required ‚Äì especially if a determination is made that the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel ‚Äì to do whatever the court says, including submitting to federal oversight of the Bowl's and Bowl teams' finances and administration, and conducting a 4, 8 or 16 team playoff, or whatever other remedy the court ordered in their holding. The Department of Justice inquiry is far and away the most potentially dangerous legal situation that the BCS has faced to date. In February 2012 former Fiesta Bowl chief executive John Junker pleaded guilty to one felony count of solicitation to commit a fraud scheme. He was sentenced later under his terms of his plea bargain. This plea dealt with the scheme the Fiesta Bowl was involved in to solicit from, and then reimburse, employees for political donations to politicians. Two people still with the Fiesta Bowl pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of making a prohibited campaign contribution, each paying fines and placed on probation for one year. On the field, for the first time, an ineligible-player situation contaminated two of the five BCS bowls in this season before they were played. In December 2010, five Ohio State players were implicated in an illegal-benefits scandal preceding the 2011 Sugar Bowl. Though the five players were suspended for five 2011 season games apiece, not only was Ohio State still allowed to play in the 2011 Sugar Bowl (which also resulted in Wisconsin playing in a Rose Bowl they otherwise would not have been allowed in, as Michigan State would have the Big Ten's Rose Bowl berth had Ohio State been removed from the three-way tie which allowed Wisconsin to gain the berth), but so were the five players. After defeating Arkansas, the scandal grew, including open deception by Ohio State coach Jim Tressel. As a result, Tressel has been forced out and, on July 11, 2011, Ohio State vacated all of its wins in an effort to reduce their penalties. =2011‚Äì12 season= By late October, it was clear that the winner of the November 5 game between LSU and Alabama would win the SEC West title, and that team would get a spot in the BCS title game if it won the rest of its games and the 2011 SEC Championship Game. LSU defeated Alabama 9‚Äì6, putting it on the inside track for the championship game. The identity of the other title game participant was less clear. Initially, Alabama's loss seemed to clear the way for Oklahoma State, which jumped to No. 2 in the BCS rankings. However, the Cowboys lost in double overtime at Iowa State on November 18, dropping them to fourth in the BCS rankings, while Alabama leaped to second. This raised the possibility of a rematch between the Tigers and Crimson Tide if both teams won out. On the final weekend of the regular season, LSU routed Georgia 42-10 to win the SEC championship and clinch a berth in the national title game. A few hours later, Oklahoma State dismantled Oklahoma 44‚Äì10, in Stillwater, to win the Big 12 title, assuring it of no worse than a bid in the 2012 Fiesta Bowl (which hosts the Big 12 champion unless it finishes in the top two of the BCS rankings). A week earlier, Alabama finished its season with a 42‚Äì14 flogging of Auburn. While Oklahoma State had seemingly been eliminated from title contention two weeks earlier, the Cowboys reentered the discussion with their convincing defeat of the Sooners. Ultimately, Oklahoma State had the second-highest computer average, while Alabama finished second in both human polls. The Tide's human-poll lead over the Cowboys was large enough to place them second in the final BCS rankings by only .0086 of a point‚Äîthe smallest margin between No. 2 and No. 3 in BCS history‚Äîsending them to the BCS title game against LSU and locking Oklahoma State into the Fiesta Bowl, in which they beat Stanford 41‚Äì38. In the run-up to the title game, most AP Poll voters said that unless Alabama won impressively, they were at least willing to consider voting LSU as national champion even if Alabama won. At least three voters said they would definitely vote the Tigers No. 1 unless the Crimson Tide won decisively. This led to the possibility of a split national championship, as the Coaches Poll is contractually obligated to vote its national championship to the winner of the BCS title game. Ultimately, Alabama defeated LSU 21‚Äì0, and hours later was a near-unanimous choice as national champion, taking all but five first-place votes in the AP Poll.Some voters might not pick BCS winner. ESPN, 2012-01-05.Alabama No. 1 in AP poll; Okla. St. No. 3. ESPN, 2012-01-10. The \\"rematch\\" bowl increased calls for a requirement that for any team to qualify for the national championship game, they must also have won their conference championship, either shared or outright. This idea was part of the discussions held after the end of the 2011 season as the BCS discussed changes for the next BCS cycle and contract period. Also for the first time, the idea of a \\"plus one\\" playoff was also discussed by the 13 conference athletic directors and Notre Dame's athletic director as they began to realize that the public opinion regarding a playoff had reached such a state that inaction might result in government action, based on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The title game debate had a ripple effect on the Sugar Bowl. Normally, the Sugar Bowl gets the first pick of SEC teams. However, with LSU and Alabama's selections to the title game, no other SEC teams were eligible for BCS bids. Ultimately, the Sugar Bowl selected No. 11 Virginia Tech and No. 13 Michigan, bypassing No. 7 Boise State, No. 8 Kansas State and No. 12 Baylor. The selection of Virginia Tech drew particular ire, since the Hokies had gone 1‚Äì2 against ranked teams, with the two losses coming by 48 points‚Äîincluding a 38‚Äì10 rout at the hands of Clemson in the ACC Championship Game. Additionally, Michigan had just barely qualified for a BCS bid; it finished just two spots above the cutoff for a team from an AQ conference to get a bid without winning its conference. By at least one account, it was the lowest-ranked at-large team from an AQ conference to receive a bid in the BCS' history, with only Illinois in 2007 equaling the #13 spot (and Illinois at least had the \\"second-place clause\\" in their favor as they were invited to the Rose Bowl with top-ranked Big Ten Champion Ohio State headed for the National Championship Game). Michigan ended up beating Virginia Tech 23-20 in Overtime. Notably, this season marked the first since 2005 that no non-AQ teams were selected. Boise State was fifth in the initial BCS rankings, but its cause was significantly hobbled when it lost to TCU 36‚Äì35 on November 12, effectively handing the Mountain West title to the Horned Frogs. Houston appeared well on its way to a bid after an undefeated regular season placed them sixth in the next-to-last BCS rankings. However, the Cougars lost in the 2011 Conference USA Football Championship Game to Southern Miss. This left Boise State and TCU as the only non-AQ teams in serious contention for a bid. However, TCU's chances for a bid ended when they finished 18th in the final BCS rankings, and accepted an invitation to the Poinsettia Bowl against WAC champion Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, whom they defeated. There continued to be confusion and speculation in the press, however, about how TCU's BCS ranking was actually computed. =2012‚Äì13 season= Three bowl-eligible teams went into the weekend of November 17 still undefeated: Kansas State, Oregon, and Notre Dame (Ohio State was also undefeated, but was ineligible for the postseason due to NCAA penalties). Kansas State and Oregon's human-poll leads over Notre Dame were large enough that it would be very difficult for the Fighting Irish to overtake the Ducks and Wildcats if all three won out. However, Kansas State was routed by Baylor 52-24, while Oregon was upended by Stanford 17-14 in overtime. Hours earlier, Notre Dame defeated Wake Forest 38-0. When the BCS rankings were released the next day, Notre Dame vaulted to the top spot in the BCS standings, and locked up a berth in the national championship game a week later with a season-ending win over USC. Those same rankings put Alabama at No. 2 behind Notre Dame, with Georgia close behind at No. 3. Both teams had already clinched berths in the 2012 SEC Championship Game. Once again, the SEC Championship Game became a de facto semifinal game for a national championship berth. With a thrilling come from behind victory, Alabama won 32-28, and easily defeated Notre Dame in the title game, 42-14. Going into the final week of the season, three non-AQ teams were in contention for a BCS bid--Kent State, Northern Illinois and Boise State, who were ranked 17th, 20th and 21st, respectively. Northern Illinois defeated Kent State 44-37 in the MAC Championship Game, while Boise State closed out its season with a 27-21 win over Colorado State. The final BCS standings had Northern Illinois at 15th. Under BCS rules, a non-AQ team must finish 16th or higher in the BCS rankings and be higher than at least one AQ champion to get a BCS berth. Since the Huskies were ranked ahead of two AQ conference champions ‚Äî Big East champ Louisville (21st) and Big Ten champ Wisconsin (unranked), this was enough to give the Huskies a berth in the BCS, making them the first and only Mid American Conference team to ever participate in a BCS game. The inclusion of the Huskies over a higher-profile team from an AQ conference was criticized by analysts, most notably ESPN's Jesse Palmer, David Pollack and Kirk Herbstreit, who claimed Northern Illinois had not played a legitimate schedule.Northern Illinois Celebrates Orange Bowl Bid; Kirk Herbstreit, ESPN Rip BCS Spot. Huffington Post, 2012-12-04. However, computer rankings showed that Northern Illinois had a stronger schedule than Boise State, as the weakness of the Mountain West due to the departures of TCU, BYU and Utah resulted in the Broncos having the lowest computer-ranking percentage of any team in the BCS standings. The Huskies earned a bid to the Orange Bowl, where they lost to Florida State, 31-10. =2013‚Äì14 season= Perhaps fittingly, the final year of the BCS produced no controversy at season's end. In mid-November, Alabama, Florida State, Ohio State and Baylor were all undefeated and ranked 1 to 4 respectively, but Alabama and Florida State held the number 1 and 2 rankings in the BCS poll. Baylor's national title hopes effectively ended on November 24 with a 49-17 thumping by Oklahoma State, and a week later, Alabama's hopes for a third straight title ended when it was upset by Auburn 34-28. When the BCS rankings were updated on December 1, Florida State moved up to No. 1, while Ohio State moved to second and Auburn jumped to third. Any debate regarding the title game matchup ended when Ohio State lost 34-24 to Michigan State in the Big Ten Championship Game, while Auburn defeated Missouri 59-42 to win the SEC Championship. Auburn vaulted to second in the final rankings, setting up a title game matchup with Florida State. The Seminoles won the last ever BCS National Championship with a 34-31 win over the Tigers, thanks to a touchdown with 11 seconds remaining in the game. Continuing their pattern of bypassing higher ranked teams, the Sugar Bowl committee chose #11 Oklahoma over #10 Oregon to play against #3 Alabama. Both teams won their bowl games convincingly, with Oklahoma defeating Alabama 45-31 and Oregon dominating Texas 30-7 in the Alamo Bowl. As a result, no clear argument could be made for either school. Support While there is substantial criticism aimed at the BCS system from coaches, media and fans alike, there is also some support for the system. Supporters claim there are several key advantages that the BCS has over a playoff system. Under the BCS, a single defeat is extremely detrimental to a team's prospects for a national championship. Supporters contend that this creates a substantial incentive for teams to do their best to win every game. Under a playoff system, front-running teams could be in a position of safety at the end of the regular season and could pull or greatly reduce their use of top players in order to protect them from injuries or give them recovery time (this happens frequently in the NFL). This is very unlikely to happen in the BCS system where a team in the running for a No. 1 or No. 2 ranking at the end of the year would be nearly certain to be punished in the polls enough for a loss that the team would be eliminated from contention. Supporters also note that for all the controversy the BCS generates about which two teams are the best in the nation, it does ensure that when there is a clear-cut top two, the national championship will be decided on the field. For example, Miami (FL) and Ohio State in 2002 were the only undefeated teams in the nation; both teams had only a couple of close contests. Under the BCS system, these two teams got to play for the championship. Before the advent of the BCS, they would have never met on the field since Ohio State would have been contractually obligated to play in the Rose Bowl. Had they both won, there would have likely been a split national championship. The NCAA, the governing organization of all collegiate sports, has no official process for determining its FBS (Div. 1-A) champion. Instead, FBS champions are chosen by what the NCAA calls in its official list of champions \\"selecting organizations\\". In 1997, pursuant to a legally binding contract which is now being examined and questioned by the United States Department of Justice in the early stages of an investigation into whether the BCS is an illegal trust or not, all 119 FBS (now 125) universities chose the BCS as their sanctioned selecting organization. The legality of the underlying contracts that bind the schools and bowls to the BCS are now under considerable government and media scrutiny. Under the current, legally questionable contracts, the BCS: \\"...is managed by the commissioners of the 11 NCAA Division I-A conferences, the director of athletics at the University of Notre Dame, and representatives of the bowl organizations. \\"...is a five-game arrangement for post-season college football that is designed to match the two top-rated teams in a national championship game and to create exciting and competitive matchups between eight other highly regarded teams in four other games\\".FOX Sports on MSN ‚Äì BCSFootball ‚Äì The BCS is This contract has no effect on any other selecting organization; it operates only on its signatories‚Äîthe member universities of the FBS. Fans or media might argue, opine and arrive at differing results from those of the BCS, but the universities (teams) are bound by the latter's processes. Still, some proponents of the BCS recognize the inconsistency that the system offers. An article taken from BCSfootball.org titled \\"Playoff Smayoff! We Don't Need It\\" openly states \\"...trust the process and we will get it right 80 percent of the time.\\" As one sports writer argued, \\"Is it too much to ask for a system that gets it right every time\\" instead of getting it right 4 out of 5 times?http://bleacherreport.com/articles/400603-system- failure-12-times-the-bcs-got-it-wrong System Failure: 12 Times The BCS Got it Wrong By Mike MacConnell FBS football is the only sport in which the NCAA has not mandated a specific bracketed playoff system, with even Division I FCS conducting a playoff every year.

The aircraft had a nose-mounted turboprop and a tail- mounted turbofan. Development In 1974, American Jet Industries started work on a design for a seven-seat executive transport, powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turboprop engine in the nose supplemented by a Williams Research Corporation WR19-3-1 turbofan mounted in the tail. The turbofan was originally intended to be a standby emergency power unit that could also be used if extra thrust was needed for take-off. The prototype, designated Hustler 400, first flew on January 11 1978. The Hustler was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tricycle landing gear, and a high- mounted tailplane. It was originally intended that the Hustler would be certified as a single-engined aircraft because the Williams turbofan had not been certified for use as an aircraft propulsion unit. But the company - by then renamed Gulfstream American - decided it should be approved as a twin- engined aircraft, and the Williams turbofan was replaced with a Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D turbofan. To enable the new engine to be fitted a extension to the forwards fuselage was implemented, allowing the cabin entrance door to be moved in front of the wing, and other aerodynamic changes. were made The intake for the jet engine was also moved from the lower rear fuselage to the base of the fin. Another change was made in 1979 when the front engine was replaced by a Garrett TPE331 turboprop, and the aircraft was re-designated the Hustler 500.

It is located 40 km northeast of Mexico City about a 45-minute drive along the Mexico City-Quer√©taro at marker number 41. In Aztec times, the area was the center of a dominion that negotiated to keep most of its independence in return with being allied with the Aztec Triple Alliance. Later, it would also be part of a \\"Republic of the Indians,\\" allowing for some autonomy under Spanish rule as well. The town became a major educational center during the colonial period when the Jesuits established the College of San Francisco Javier. The college complex that grew from its beginnings in 1580 would remain an educational center until 1914. Today this complex houses the Museo del Virreinato (Museum of the Vice Regal or Colonial Period), with one of the largest collections of art and other objects from this time period. The name Tepotzotl√°n is of Nahuatl origin and means \\"among humpbacks,\\" referring to the shape of the hills that surround this area. The oldest surviving Aztec glyph for this area is found in the Ozuna Codex, which features a humpbacked person sitting on top of a hill. This is now the symbol of the municipality. Another version of the glyph shows a humpbacked person defending a \\"teocalli\\" or sacred precinct. The municipality also has a lesser- known European-style coat-of-arms. This contains the officially adopted version of the glyph in the upper part, a representation of the Arcos del Sitio, the facade of the Church of San Francisco Javier and chimneys and a tractor representing both the agriculture and industry found here. Underneath these are written the words \\"Libertad, Cultura y Trabajo\\" (Liberty, Culture and Work). History of the city and municipality The first ethnic group was most likely the Otomi, who settled here between 2500 BCE. and 100 CE (pre- classic period). At about 100 C. E., the Teotihuacan became ascendant, with the Otomis here subject to Teotihuacan until about 700 CE. During the period that Teotihuacan was in decline, a Nahua-Chichimeca tribe headed by Chicontonatiuh, took control of this area, along with what is now Maxuexhuacan, Chapa de Mota, and Huehuetoca. After the death of Chichontonatuih, nine other chiefs ruled this same area until 1174. After this time other Nahua and Chichimeca people began to arrive here and the rest of the Valley of Mexico. The area then came to be ruled by a chieftain named Xotlotl, who explored the valley's lakes and took the first census ever here, counting about a million people living in the Valley of Mexico. Rule over this area passed from father to son peacefully for a number of generations until the early 14th century. Conflict with neighboring Xaltocan and Texcoco led to a number of political intrigues, including the assassination of one of the few female lords in the Valley of Mexico, Ehuatlicuetzin in 1372. In the first part of the 15th century, the Aztec Empire began to consolidate and extend its power north. At this time the area was ruled by Ayactlacatzin and the area was called Xaquintehcutli. Ayactlacatzin negotiated an alliance with Moctezuma I to allow this dominion, renamed Tepotzotl√°n, to remain semi-independent after Azcapotzalco fell to the Triple Alliance in 1460. This arrangement stayed intact until the fall of Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan in 1521. Macuilxochitzin was governor of Tepotzotl√°n when the Spanish arrived here in 1520. This dominion opposed the Spanish invasion. When the Spanish subdued the main city, they destroyed everything in their path. Evangelization work was begun here in 1525 by friars Alonso de Guadalupe and Alonso de Herrero, who built a hermitage over the ruins of the old city in Tepotzotl√°n in the same year. The Church of San Pedro Apostol sits on the site of the hermitage today. These were followed by Toribio de Benavente Motolina and Jer√≥nimo de Mendieta of the Franciscans. By 1547, Tepotzotlan had become a center of the spread of the new faith, with surrounding villages under its jurisdiction. Diego Nequametzin, son of Macuilxochitzin, succeeded his father and ruled under the Spanish from 1534 to 1549, but severe economic problems as well as epidemics of typhoid and smallpox decimated the population here. Eventually, the area became completely under the control of an encomienda under Juan de Ortega. When Ortega died, the land became property of the Spanish Crown, who created a \\"corregimiento\\" under the dominion of the nearby city of Cuautitl√°n. The Indians here were granted limited autonomy in the way of a \\"Republic of the Indians\\", with Pedro de San Agust√≠n as the first governor. In 1580, the first of the Jesuits arrived, eventually established three schools; one for the training of Jesuit priests in indigenous languages, a school for Indian boys called San Mart√≠n to teach Spanish, reading, writing, religion, music and trade skills, and last a college to train Jesuit novices. The first two were founded completely in Tepotzotl√°n but the third and largest was due to the movement of priest training from the College of San Pedro y San Pablo in Mexico City to here in 1585. It was named the College of San Francisco Javier and all three would be housed in the same complex, bringing Tepozotl√°n fame as one of the most important educational centers of New Spain. This college would produce a number of famous Jesuits such as Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora, Francisco Javier Clavijero, Francisco Javier Alegre and Eusebio Francisco Kino. These Jesuit schools, along with the large number of haciendas and ranches that the Jesuits owned in this area, pushed both the cultural and economic development of this region north of Mexico City and would continue to do so until the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767. After the expulsion, the school complex was ceded to regular clergy for the training of priests under the name of Real Colegio de Instrucci√≥n Retiro Voluntario y Correcci√≥n para el Clero Secular until it was abandoned permanently in the early 20th century. Tepozotl√°n became a municipality in 1814, patterning itself after the precepts contained in the Cadiz Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of Apatzingan. The municipality remained rural and quiet until the Mexico City-Quer√©taro highway was built in 1954. This highway would have a profound impact on the economic development of Tepotzotl√°n, making it a part of the fast-growing Mexico City Metropolitan Area from the mid-20th century on. The city The city of Tepotzotl√°n is located very close to the Mexico City-Quer√©taro highway, which cuts across the municipality. It is made up of the neighborhoods of San Mart√≠n, Tlacateco, Texcacoa, Capula, Las Animas, El Tr√©bol, Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n and Puente Grande. Because of the highway and the growth of the Mexico City metropolitan area, the city is experiencing rapid growth. Population is growing an average of 3.5% annually. The highway has provided a route for commuters since it was built in the 1950s enticing people to move out of the city to here. This movement of people has accelerated since the 1985 Mexico City earthquake as the Tepotzotl√°n area is far less prone to violent shaking than Mexico City proper. The parts of town closest to the highway are the most developed, hosting industrial parks and housing developments. However, the center of town has maintained its colonial-era appearance with cobblestone alleys, arcades and plazas. There is a small, secular plaza in front of the main church, which contains a kiosk at which many cultural events take place. The municipal market is known for its food stands selling traditional dishes as quesadillas, sopes, pambazos, and tacos as well as barbacoa, and carnitas. More elaborate dishes here include cabrito, chapulines, snails and escamoles (ant eggs) which are generally available in the restaurants in town like Hoster√≠a del Convento. On weekends, tianguises pop up all over the center of the town, selling food, crafts, artwork, handcrafted furniture, tile, baskets and leather items. Festivals in the town and municipality include the Festival of Flowers in March, the Feast of Saint Peter (patron saint of Tepotzotlan) in June, the Festival of the Se√±or del Nicho (Preciosa Sangre de Cristo) in September and the International Festival of Music in September. The city had a population of 39,374 as of 2005 and is 2300 meters above sea level. Tepotzotl√°n has been named one of the Pueblos M√°gicos of Mexico, mostly due to the town's center, which not only has conserved its colonial look despite its proximity to Mexico City, but also because it is the home of the Church of San Francisco Javier and the Museo de Virreinato (Museum of the Viceroyalty). Since being named a Pueblo Magico, much effort has been put into rescuing and restoring much of the buildings of the town's past. =Museum of Viceroyalty of New Spain= The Museo del Virreinato, or Museum of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Colonial) Period, is housed in a complex that was built by the Society of Jesus or Jesuits in the 1580s. Here they established three schools. The first was dedicated to training Jesuit missionaries the indigenous languages of Mexico, the second was to provide education to Indian boys. The third was the movement of the training of Jesuit priests from the College of San Pedro y San Pablo in Mexico City to a new facility called the College of San Francisco Javier. These schools would make Tepotzotl√°n one of the most prestigious educational centers in New Spain. Most of the complex is taken up by the Museo del Virreinato situated in what used to be the College of San Francisco Javier. The Museo is considered to be one of the most impressive in the country due both to its collection and to the aesthetics of the building that houses it. The complex contains a number of interior courtyards, such as the Aljibes and the Naranjo, as well as a domestic chapel, library, dormitories, refectory, and kitchen. A wide arched passageway in the back of the complex leads to the extensive gardens area of more than 3 hectares, filled with gardens, sculptures and the original Salta de Agua fountain, which marked the end of the old Chapultepec aqueduct. Much of its collection is made of liturgical pieces from the old Museum of Religious Art which was part of the Mexico City Cathedral. The collection is one of the largest from the Mexican colonial era. There are exhibits of non-religious everyday items from the colonial period such as silverware and other objects of precious metals, textiles and tools. The Church of San Francisco Javier is no longer used for religious services and is now part of the museum. This church contains one of the most important collections of Churrigueresque altarpieces in Mexico. The municipality=Geography= As municipal seat, the city of Tepotzotl√°n has governing jurisdiction over the following communities: Ca√±ada de Cisneros, Colonia los Dolores (Ex-hacienda los Dolores), San Mateo Xoloc, San Miguel Ca√±adas, Santa Cruz, Santiago Cuautlalpan, Las Caba√±as, Barrio de Texcacoa, Arcos del Sitio, La Concepci√≥n, El Jag√ºey, Lanzarote, La Pedrera (La Mina), Ex-hacienda San Jos√© la Teja, Pe√±a Colorada, Casas Hogar Fidel Vel√°zquez, Lumbrera N√∫mero Diez, La Luz, La Pedrera, Ejido Santiago, Santiago el Alto, Fraccionamiento Club Virreyes, Ampliaci√≥n los Potros (Tres Piedras), Colonia Guadalupe, Barrio de la Luz, Rancho el Arroyo, El Puerto de los Huizaches, Las Lechuguillas, Barranca de la Pila, La Estancia II, Rancho la Joya and El Gavillero. After the seat, the largest communities in the municipality are San Mateo X√≥loc, Santa Cruz, Santiago Cuahutlalpan and Ca√±adas de Cisneros. The total municipal population was 67,724 as of 2005. While very few in number, indigenous groups still represented here are Nahuas and Otomis. There is also a community of Triques, who arrived here from Justrahuacan, Putla, Oaxaca and still speak the Trique language. The municipality, founded in 1814, is bordered by the municipalities of Huehuetoca, Coyotepec, Cuautitl√°n Izcalli, Nicol√°s Romero, Coyotepec, Teoloyucan and Villa del Carb√≥n as well as the State of Hidalgo with a total area of 208.83 km¬≤. The municipality varies in altitude from 2,250 to 2,900 meters above sea level. The municipality has a mostly temperate climate with most rain falling in the summer and freezing temperatures common in the winter months. Predominant winds are from the northeast. 91% of the municipality is rural with about 9% developed. Much of the rural area is the Sierra de Tepotzotl√°n mountain range, which extends into neighboring Huehuetoca. There are two rivers here, the Hondo de Tepotzotl√°n and the Lanzarote, with a number of fresh-water springs and streams. There is one large dam called La Concepci√≥n along with a number of small ones, which are primarily used for the raising of fish. Most of the rural land consists of forest (47%) with agriculture and fish production next at about 20% each. Agriculture and fish farming account for over 40% of the economic activity of this municipality. Industry is a growing part of the economic base, with over ninety factories dedicated to the production of metals, processed meats, car parts, textiles and dyes. In third place is tourism which is mostly limited to the town center, the Arcos de Sitio and the ecological park. Much of the valley here is still dedicated to agriculture but this is being replaced by urbanization. Much of this urbanization is in the way of industrial parks, such as the Parque Industrial El Convento I and the Parque Industrial FRISA San Jose, which is of recent construction. Both are located very close to the Mexico City-Quer√©taro highway. Another impetus to urbanization is the building of housing developments to handle the influx of people moving here from Mexico City. =Points of Interest= The Aqueduct of Xalpa, better known as the Arcos del Sitio is a monumental aqueduct that carried water from the Oro River to Tepozotl√°n. The aqueduct was built between the 18th and 19th centuries. It was begun by the Jesuits to bring water to their monastery and college but it was not finished because the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767. It would not be finished until the 19th century by Manuel Romero de Terreros. The site that gives the aqueduct the name \\"Arcos del Sitio\\" is the deep gorge through which it passes. Here the aqueduct reaches 61 meters in height, with four levels of arches. The total length of the aqueduct is 41,900 meters. It is the highest aqueduct in Latin America. This gorge is at the site of the old La Concepc√≠on Hacienda, which was one of many owned by the Jesuits. In 1780, it was acquired by Pedro Romero de Terreros and was in the family until 1980. In 1993, restoration work was begun, ending in 1997. It was a farming hacienda that provided much of the foodstuffs for the Jesuits. Today, the hacienda is open to the public by appointment and can host guests as well as special events. Also here is the Centro Ecotur√≠stico y de Educaci√≥n Ambiental. It is now home to the Centro Ecoturistico y de Educaci√≥n Ambiental Arcos del Sitio. It contains 54 hectares and hosts sports such as hiking, mountain biking and camping. The area is filled with reptiles, amphibians and birds. Annually, about 750,000 visit this park. The Parque Ecol√≥gico Xochitla is located three km outside the city of Tepotzotl√°n, which used to be a hacienda known as La Resurrecci√≥n. It is operated by the non-profit Xochitla Foundation. It is about 70 hectares of parkland with about 7,000 species of trees and other plants. It has workshops, playgrounds, expositions, a greenhouse and a lake with a wide variety of aquatic plants. It also contains a very large and very old ginkgo biloba tree from China. The Sierra de Tepotzotl√°n state park comprises 13,175 hectares over the municipalities of Tepotzotl√°n and Huehuetoca. It was declared a state park and ecological preservation zone in 1977. However, since then much of the sierra has been decommissioned as a park to create the Military Base 37C. The sierra contains forests of holm oak, strawberry trees and kermes oak, with areas of scrub and meadows. In the low- lying areas cactus and agave can be found. Along the river that runs through here are ash trees, trees of heaven, willows and others. Wildlife consists of small mammals such as coyotes and squirrels as well as a large number of birds and reptiles. Sports that can be practiced here included hiking, camping, swimming, rock climbing and rappelling. See also *photo gallery.

In the early 1960s they built a conglomerate in a fashion similar to LTV or Litton, during which time they developed the first CAD system and explored optical disc technology. These efforts were unsuccessful, and the company shed divisions to various companies, returning to its roots in the reconnaissance market. The remaining portions were eventually purchased by Litton in 1983, and then Hughes, Raytheon, and Goodrich Corporation. History=Beginnings= Richard Leghorn was a former United States Air Force (USAF) aerial reconnaissance expert who had first proposed flying reconnaissance missions over enemy territory in peacetime.Lewis, 2002 Leghorn left the Air Force to become head of Eastman Kodak's European division,Time, 1963 and started writing about the \\"Open Skies\\" proposal, which he strongly supported. Open Skies proposed to allow any signing nation to overfly any other, which Leghorn believed would lower international tensions by allowing countries to verify the actions of their adversaries. Eisenhower raised the issue at the 1955 Geneva summit meetings as a way to reduce mutual fears of a surprise attack.\\"This Day in History 1955: Eisenhower presents his 'Open Skies' plan\\" At the time, the United States would have had a huge advantage if Open Skies was adopted, as their numerous European and Asian airbases would allow them access to the Soviet heartland, while the lack of USSR bases in the Americas ‚Äî this being prior to the Cuban Revolution ‚Äî would have made the treaty an empty promise. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets opposed Open Skies, something Eisenhower later admitted he fully expected. While Leghorn's writings on the topic were being widely read, he was secretly informed that the United States had already taken him up on his initial proposal, and the United States Air Force (and Royal Air Force) were in the process of flying reconnaissance flights over the USSR. Aware that this would generate vast amounts of photography over long periods of time, Leghorn realized that a major problem would be storing the resulting imagery and allowing it to be easily retrieved for study. Kodak was in the process of introducing its \\"Minicard\\" aperture card product, and Leghorn felt this was a natural solution for the problem.Tyler et all Leghorn sought improvement by combining it with machinery dedicated to the task of indexing the information required for reconnaissance. Leghorn contacted his long-time friend Theodore \\"Teddy\\" Walkowicz about forming a new company to build such a machine for the Air Force. Walkowicz was an associate of venture capitalist Laurance Rockefeller, and eventually secured a seed loan for $600,000 in exchange for a directorship. Leghorn became president of the new company, whose ITEK name was a phonetic short form of \\"information technology\\". Since Leghorn formerly worked at Kodak, there is speculation that the company name was an acronym for \\"I Took Eastman Kodak\\".DeepChip, Howard Landman =Corona= Weeks after the company formed in late 1957, Leghorn took it in an entirely different direction by purchasing the Boston University Physical Research Laboratory (BUPRL), which researched reconnaissance cameras. BUPRL was designing the HYAC-1 camera for the USAF's reconnaissance balloon efforts, cameras that would eventually fly on the WS-461L balloons during 1957.Robert Craig Johnson, \\"Genetrix, WS-461L, and Chaika: Cold War Balloons and Balloon Fighters\\" , 1999 Now at Itek, the company won contracts for similar cameras for aircraft like the U-2 and SR-71. The CIA quickly informed them of their top secret Corona to produce the first spy satellites, and asked them to bid on the camera systems. Itek returned a design that used a rotating mirror to record panoramic swaths of the ground. Film was delivered from a canister and wrapped around a cylindrical window that allowed the maximum length of film to be used in a single exposure, increasing resolution. The rotation of the mirror was timed to properly account for the movement of the satellite to avoid stretching the images on-film. The result was a single long photograph showing a \\"strip\\" of land. At the time, the CIA had already contracted Fairchild Camera and Instrument to supply cameras, but Itek's submission was technically superior and won them the contract in March or April 1958.Richelson, pg. 24 To soften the blow, the CIA had Fairchild build the devices until Itek could start its own manufacturing capabilities. Leghorn was upset by the terms of the agreement, and at one point in 1959 issued a \\"stop work\\" order on the project to change its terms.Richelson, pg. 25 The CIA quickly acquiesced, although they were spooked by the event. Had Itek lost the Corona contract, it was highly likely that the company would have collapsed. This possibility so worried the CIA that they arranged a personal meeting between Rockefeller and the CIA's chief of technical development, Richard Bissell, to inform Rockefeller of the Corona project and make him aware that national security rested on the company's well-being. Leghorn, he felt, needed direct supervision. Shortly after winning Corona, Itek also won the contract for the Air Force's satellite program, SAMOS. SAMOS originally envisioned a semi-real- time system that downloaded imagery via an onboard scanner, but later expanded to envision a number of different imaging systems based on a single airframe. One of these, E-5, was a project to provide low-resolution wide-area imagery for mapping purposes, which the Air Force needed to plan ingress routes for bombers during war. The SAMOS project was eventually abandoned, leaving several of the E-5 cameras in storage at a Lockheed facility.Richelson, pg. 57 =Diversification efforts= After winning the CORONA contract, Itek quickly grew from the executive staff to a company employing over a hundred scientists, engineers, and technicians. After only a year its revenues were in the millions, and the company started the process of raising an initial public offering. In public the company stated that while their work was classified, they were working in the field of \\"information management\\" (some writers have commented that this may be the first use of the term). The real reasons for this growth - the BURPL purchase - remained secret, so on paper it appeared that Itek's information systems were generating huge orders that demanded a large staff. Writers speculated that the military might allow the company to release their work to the public, making the company highly valuable. Over the space of a few months, the value of the stock grew from $2 to $255, triggering a 5-for-1 split. Using the newly inflated value of their stock, Leghorn started an aggressive diversification effort. In 1960 Leghorn agreed to fund development of a computerized drafting system, EDM, based on the PDP-1 that had earlier been experimented on at MIT.Kosowsky, 2006 The same year he arranged a merger with Hermes Electronics (originally Hycon Eastern), makers of various military communications systems. This was followed by the 1961 purchase of Photostat Corp., maker of offset printing systems using Kodak patents. In 1962 he lured Gilbert King away from IBM, where he had worked on the Automatic Language Translator and had developed the world's only working optical disc.John Hutchins (ed), \\"Gilbert W. King and the IBM-USAF Translator\\", Early Years in Machine Translation, John Benjamins, 2000, (RADC- TDR-62-105) Meanwhile, work continued on the original archiving system, but the company proved unable to deliver a working product. Meanwhile, none of Itek's purchases turned into commercial successes, and in 1961 Itek reported a $2,500,000 loss. Its stock began to drop, hitting a low of $9.50. In spite of the CIA's warnings, Rockefeller did little to address Leghorn's problems, which grew out of control. Frustrated by Leghorn ignoring the reconnaissance side of the company in favor of the continuing string of information projects, the engineers revolted and demanded that he be removed. Walkowicz brought in Franklin Lindsay, a former CIA operative, to help Leghorn get the company back on track. This effort backfired, as Leghorn was insulted by the effort and refused to cooperate. In May 1962 Leghorn was pushed out in favor of Lindsay, who became Itek's president and CEO. With Lindsay at the helm, Itek returned to focusing mostly on reconnaissance efforts, although by this point their photocopying machines were starting to become successful as well. As a side- effect of this newfound focus, Lindsay shed a number of Leghorn's acquisitions. The first to go was the EDM project in 1962, which ironically became a profitable division of Control Data as their Digigraphics system. By 1964 Lindsay had returned the company to profitability. By this time the CORONA program had overcome its initial failures and had become a success. Itek would eventually deliver about 200 panoramic cameras for the CORONA program. A further success involved the E-5 cameras originally built for the SAMOS project. In 1961 CORONA delivered low-resolution imagery of a new installation that became known as the \\"Tallinn line\\". A debate broke out over their significance; some suggested that it was an antiballistic missile installation using the SA-5 Gammon missile, while others pointed out that the resolution was too low to say anything of the sort. A rush effort started at Lockheed to adapt the E-5 camera to the existing CORONA airframe, resulting in the LANYARD project, today known as the KH-6. The project was, generally, a failure. Three satellites were launched, one returning no film and one only blank frames. =Formation of the NRO= Both the CIA and Air Force continued development of new satellite systems, which led to concerns about the proper use of these valuable and expensive resources. These concerns eventually led to the formation of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in 1961, with the overall mission of ensuring that satellite data was distributed properly, and that the satellite time was not wasted, either by photographing the same area twice, or by allowing an area of interest to be photographed by the first available means. Although the Air Force was able to work within the new environment without any apparent problems, creation of the NRO led to serious political infighting with the CIA.Richelson, pg. 122 In 1963 Albert \\"Bud\\" Wheelon took over from Bissell as the CIA's chief of technology development. Unlike Bissell, who worked almost entirely with outside contractors, Wheelon started internalizing the process and built up a much larger department. In October 1963 he suggested forming the \\"Satellite Photography Working Group\\" to study their current efforts and suggest improvements. Under the new agreements, the NRO was supposed to supply funding for the effort, and on 18 November they agreed. In a following experiment the team attempted to determine the optimal resolution for satellite photography, degrading a series of high-quality photographs in stages to see how much information could be pulled from them at different levels of detail. The results strongly suggested building a new satellite with a 2-foot resolution, something what would not be able to be done by improving the existing CORONA system, which offered 10‚Äì25 foot resolution. The NRO declined to offer funding for the satellite, however, so Wheelon arranged funding from its own budget and started the \\"FULCRUM\\" effort.Richelson, pg. 125 When news of the FULCRUM efforts later found their way to the NRO, a major fight broke out that eventually landed on the desk of Robert McNamara. NRO was supposed to be in charge of coordinating development, and was at that point funding development of the Air Force's 18-inch resolution design, KH-7 \\"GAMBIT\\". Stung by the outcome, the project suffered a further setback when Itek announced that they would no longer work on FULCRUM's camera because of a demand that they felt was unreasonable,Richelson, pg. 127 although other sources suggested it was the final result of a long stream of demands and design changes coming from the newly enlarged CIA division. Wheelon retaliated by handing the contract to Perkin-Elmer, which delivered the cameras for what would become the successful KH-9 \\"HEXAGON\\", better known as \\"Big Bird\\". There are two different versions of the story of what followed. Richelson states that the NRO quickly handed Itek a contract for their own \\"S-2\\" system, a follow-on to the Air Force's troubled SAMOS program. This project had originally selected a Kodak camera, and changed to an Itek design after their FULCRUM announcement. He notes the suggestion that the offer was pre-arranged, in order to deprive the CIA of their camera, and thereby doom the FULCRUM effort. Lewis states that both the FULCRUM and S-2 projects had already been handed to Itek, and it was the internal power struggles between the CIA and NRO that led to Wheelon's stream of demands as punishment for accepting the S2 work. Whatever the story, Itek was no longer the CIA's primary supplier after CORONA and LANYARD ended, allowing Perkin-Elmer to become a major supplier. S-2 was later downgraded. =Through the 1970s= Into this void came a number of different projects. One of these was the KA-80 \\"Optical Bar Camera\\" that flew on both the U-2 and SR-71, as well as a further development of the mapping camera from SAMOS/LANYARD that was used on some of the Big Birds. Itek also found a customer for their panoramic cameras with NASA, who used them both on Project Apollo for mapping the lunar surface,\\"The ITEK Panoramic Camera\\" , NASA as well as Project Viking's Mars landers.\\"SP-425 The Martian Landscape - Cameras Without Pictures\\", NASA Later they built portions of the Keck Telescope and similar projects. During the same period, Itek's Graphic Systems division, originally supplying the printing systems, had greatly diversified. =Litton purchase= In 1982 Litton Industries was attempting to diversify their military holdings, and engaged Lehman Brothers to arrange the purchase of a company specializing in electronic warfare. Lehman found a number of companies that Litton might be interested in, including Itek, presenting a report on 20 September 1982. In October, Litton started purchasing Itek stock in the market in an effort to gain control of about 4.9% of the common shares before making a friendly takeover offer.967 F.2d 742 On 23 November the chairmen of the two companies met, and by January 1983 the negotiations had progressed to the point of making a formal offer. At the advice of Lehman Brothers, Litton made an offer of the current market price plus a 50% premium. During this period the value of Itek stock was rising, so Litton had to increase their offer on several occasions. On 12 January 1983, Litton made an offer of $48, which succeeded on 4 March 1983. Itek became Litton's Itek Division, although the Itek Graphic Systems division was sold off in 1985.\\"Litton Set to Sell Itek Graphic Unit\\", The New York Times, 14 February 1985 In 1986 it was revealed that a Lehman Brothers trader had been purchasing Itek stock during the negotiations, part of a wider insider trading scandal. Ira Sokolow, part of the Lehman team arranging the Itek purchase, had leaked information about the deal to another Lehman employee, Dennis Levine. They agreed to make insider trades to drive up the stock price and then split the profits. Levine and other traders at Lehman (either tipped off or simply following Levine's trades) started collecting Itek stock and were thus rewarded with part of the 50% premium when the deal closed.Ronald Sullivan, \\"Litton Wins Court Round In Itek Case\\", The New York Times, 19 June 1992 Litton later sued Lehman, claiming that their purchase would have been at a lower price had the insider trading not occurred. The stock price rose from $26 to $33 during this period, meaning that had the price stayed at $26 a fair offer would have been $39. A lengthy series of court cases followed. =Hughes, Raytheon, and Goodrich purchase= Litton downsized dramatically in the 1990s, selling off many of its components. In 1996 Hughes Electronics purchased what was then left of Itek, Itek Optical Systems.\\"Hughes acquires Itek Optical Systems from Litton Industries\\" At the time they announced that Itek's own facilities in Lexington, Massachusetts would fold into their own Hughes Danbury Optical Systems in Danbury, CT. Later in the 1990s, after Raytheon's purchase of Hughes, Itek became Raytheon Optical Systems Company. In early 2000, Raytheon divested the Optical Systems group and it was purchased by Goodrich Corporation. Goodrich Corporation was subsequently purchased by United Technologies Corporation headquartered in East Hartford, Connecticut.

A foe of the hero Spider-Man, the original Living Brain was created by the fictional International Computing Machines Corporation and billed as the most intelligent computer and robot in existence, capable of solving virtually any question asked of it. In more recent times, it was reprogrammed by the Superior Spider-Man to serve as a laboratory assistant at Parker Industries, and remained in that role after Peter Parker returned.

Art by Steve Ditko. The Living Brain, soon after its creation, is brought to Midtown High School by its creator Dr. Petty as a part of a demonstration of its renowned ability to solve any problem. The students agreed to ask the machine what is Spider-Man's secret identity, and a nervous Peter Parker, the volunteer for the demonstration, fed it all of the given known information from the students concerning the wall-crawler, relievingly finding the answer to be in a mathematical code for Peter to decode overnight (because of this, it is unknown if the Living Brain correctly deduced Spider-Man's true identity). During the course of the Living Brain's demonstration, the two workmen hired to transport it overhear how the Living Brain has the ability to answer anything and they decide to steal it to use this ability for gambling purposes. Caught in the middle of their stealing it by Dr. Petty, one of the workmen quickly knocks him out, but by doing so bumps the other one into the Living Brain's control panel on its chest, causing the Living Brain to malfunction. Going on a rampage through Midtown High, the Living Brain is confronted by Spider-Man, who eventually shuts it down. At the end of the day as Peter is walking back home, he plans on telling everyone the next day he'd lost the code during the confusion. The Living Brain reappears several years later, now discredited and broken-down. Dr. Petty plans to donate it to Midtown High School's science lab. The Living Brain ends up being stolen by Dr. Petty's son Steve Petty who modifies the robot, giving it a gold and red color scheme, clawed hands and the ability to fly. Remotely controlling the Living Brain to attack a bully who had been tormenting him, Steve is eventually defeated by Spider-Man (who had been on a visit to Midtown High as Peter Parker) and the Living Brain is shut down once more. The Living Brain, restored to its pre-upgrade appearance, was then acquired by a group of criminals, who used it to commit robberies. The robot and its controllers were apprehended by Spider-Man, who mockingly referred to the Living Brain as \\"a talking gumball machine\\".

During the railway construction in the Lake Superior area, he became known as the Apostle of the Railway Builders, providing pastoral services to the camps. Father Baxter was important in the development of northwestern Ontario's Catholic institutions as well as being a man of the people. He was officially recognized in 1978 with a memorial plaque at St Andrew's Catholic Church, Thunder Bay, Ontario.

Construction of the building was completed in early September 2008. When built it was the tallest building in the Republic of Ireland. Since the completion of Capital Dock in the Dublin Docklands in 2018, it has become the second tallest building in the Republic of Ireland. Site description It consists of a number of connected 6-8 storey buildings, with a 17-storey tower on the southwest corner of the site. The tower is 68.28 metres (224 ft) to the top floor, making it the second tallest storeyed building in the Republic of Ireland. The complex includes an enclosed Japanese garden and a two-level basement garage. Development The Elysian in 2017 viewed from Eglinton Street The building opened during an economic crisis in Ireland and by late April 2009, 80% of the 211 apartments remained unsold and 50% of the commercial units were vacant. As of October 2009 this situation continued, earning the building the nickname \\"The Idle Tower\\", a pun on a nearby hostelry known as The Idle Hour. An article in The Irish Times newspaper described the Elysian as a \\"Mary Celeste adrift in the recession\\" Mandatory annual management fees for an apartment in the Elysian are ‚Ç¨4,000 per year. In January 2010, developer O'Flynn Construction's debts of ‚Ç¨1.8bn were acquired by the National Asset Management Agency, which bundled them as \\"Project Tower\\" and sold them for ‚Ç¨1.1bn in May 2014 to Carbon Finance, a subsidiary of The Blackstone Group. In December 2014, an Aldi supermarket opened on the ground floor. A dispute between O'Flynn and Carbon on repayments was settled in February 2015, with Carbon retaining ownership of the Elysian. By May 2017, 180 of the 211 apartments available were let, with works ongoing to furnish the remaining 31 apartments. As of 2017, it was announced that all apartments in the building were fully let. In April 2018, Blackstone sold the complex to Kennedy Wilson for a reported ‚Ç¨87.5 million.

It is the fourth novel in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. The novel was first published in the United States on May 6, 2008 by Hyperion Books for Children, an imprint of Disney Publishing Worldwide. It has been published in hardcover, audiobook, ebook, and large-print editions. To date, The Battle of the Labyrinth has been translated into 29 languages from its original English. The book follows the adventures of modern-day fifteen-year-old demigod Percy Jackson, the son of a mortal woman and the Greek god Poseidon. Percy and his friends Annabeth Chase, Grover Underwood, Rachel Dare and Tyson attempt to stop Luke Castellan and his army from invading Camp Half-Blood through Daedalus's labyrinth by trying to prevent the Ariadne's string from falling into his hands. The Battle of the Labyrinth received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the storyline, humor and action present in the novel. The novel was on the Amazon Children's bestseller list and Publishers Weekly Facts and Figures bestseller list. It was also the runner-up for the 2010 Indian Paintbrush Book Award. Plot Percy Jackson attends freshman orientation at Goode High School, where he sees Rachel Elizabeth Dare, a mortal who can see through the Mist. She helps him fight two empousai and escape. Percy travels to Camp Half-Blood, where he learns Grover is in trouble with the Council of Cloven Elders for not having found Pan. During a competition organized by the new sword instructor Quintus, Annabeth and Percy accidentally find an entrance into the Labyrinth, which presents a possible invasion route for Luke. Annabeth is given leadership of a quest to find Daedalus and convince the inventor not to give Luke Ariadne's string, which would help him navigate the Labyrinth. She chooses Grover, Percy, and Tyson to accompany her. Before leaving, Percy learns that Nico plans to bring back his late sister (with help from King Minos) by exchanging her soul for someone who has cheated death - like Percy. In the maze, the questers face a number of trials including meeting Briares, the Sphinx, and Janus, before arriving at the ranch of Geryon and meeting Nico. They seek out Hephaestus, and after speaking to him they part ways; Tyson and Grover search for Pan, while Annabeth and Percy go to the god's forge in the volcano Mount St. Helens. In the forge, Percy is almost killed by Kronos's smiths, but escapes by causing an earthquake that ejects him from the volcano. When Percy awakens, he finds himself on the island Ogygia with Calypso, a daughter of the Titan Atlas. Calypso tells Percy she is cursed to fall in love with every hero that lands on her island, but the hero can never stay. After Hephaestus tells him of events in the mortal world, Percy realizes that he too must leave. Back at Camp Half-Blood, Percy and Annabeth go to Manhattan to find Rachel, who should be able to navigate the Labyrinth. Despite being captured by Luke's minions, they eventually reach Daedalus's workshop and learn Quintus is actually the ancient inventor, living as an automaton. He informs them that, believing they could not withstand a Titan assault, he has already helped Luke. The group is discovered by Luke, who tells them Minos has been planning to exchange Daedalus's soul for his own. The four teenagers fight to escape while the betrayed Daedalus remains in the maze with his hellhound. The quartet later discover the Titan fortress at Mount Othrys, and learn that Luke has been somehow possessed by Kronos. They run into Grover and Tyson, and discover the resting place of Pan, who speaks to them and passes part of his fading spirit into each of them. The group, minus Rachel, then heads back to Camp Half-Blood to fight. The Titan army floods out of the Labyrinth and appears to be winning until Daedalus arrives with Mrs. O‚ÄôLeary and Briares, who kills Kamp√™. Grover scares off the remaining Titan forces by causing a Panic. After the battle, Nico helps Daedalus pass on, destroying the Labyrinth. After a memorial service for the dead campers, Percy leaves camp for the school year. On his fifteenth birthday at summer's end, Percy receives a visit from his father Poseidon, who gives him a sand dollar, advising him to ‚Äúspend it wisely‚Äù. Nico later appears to tell Percy his plan to defeat Luke once and for all. = Characters = *Percy Jackson is the 15-year-old son of Poseidon. He is the series' narrator. He joins Annabeth in her quest to go into the labyrinth to find Daedalus' workshop. *Annabeth Chase is the 15-year-old daughter of Athena, and one of Percy's closest friends. She gets the quest to navigate the Labyrinth. Her feelings for Percy start to show but she is confused because of her lingering feelings towards Luke. *Rachel Elizabeth Dare is a mortal who can see through the Mist. Her father is a wealthy businessman who buys the undeveloped land of the wild and builds developments upon it. Percy had previously met her at the Hoover Dam in The Titan's Curse, where she helped him get away from the undead warriors. *Grover Underwood is a satyr and Percy's best friend. His life's ambition is to find Pan, the lost god of the Wild. Grover, Tyson, Percy, Annabeth, Nico and Rachel find Pan inside Carlsbad Caverns along with some extinct animals. He gave all of them except Nico words of wisdom, and then died. When he died, his essence entered all of the characters' mouths (except Nico), meaning a piece of the wild remained in their hearts. He gave Grover the famous battle cry, Panic, which Grover used to scare off the intruders in Camp Half-Blood. The word Panic is named after Pan because in the Titan war he let out a horrible cry that drove all the monsters back to where they came from. *Tyson is Percy's cyclops half-brother. He now works for his father in Poseidon's palace, under the oceans, in the Cyclopes' forge. Tyson enjoys forging, and nicknaming mythical creatures they come across. He joins Percy and his friends in the Labyrinth. *Nico di Angelo is an 11-year-old son of Hades. Upset that his sister Bianca died, he is slightly unstable, and attempts to trade Daedalus' soul for that of Bianca. He has a sword made of Stygian iron. *Luke Castellan is a 22-year-old son of Hermes and traitor to the Olympians. His body becomes possessed by the spirit of Kronos. *Daedalus/Quintus was the creator of the Labyrinth and son of Athena, and has made a total of five automatons in order to cheat death. He becomes the new swordsman at Camp Half-Blood under the name Quintus, but only to see if Camp Half-Blood is worth saving. During the intrusion of Camp Half-Blood, he is stabbed, but instead of blood coming out of the wound, golden oil leaks from his automaton body. He has a murderer's mark on his neck (a partridge), a brand that appears on all of his bodies as a curse from Athena, because he killed his nephew, Perdix. He owns a hellhound named Mrs. O'Leary. After his death, he was assigned to build overpasses and bridges to help control traffic in the Underworld and according to Nico, he is happy with this job. Before he dies, he gives Annabeth a laptop containing all of the works he never had time to complete, as well as many of his ideas and theories. Composition and marketing Rick Riordan, the author, at the release of The Battle of the Labyrinth The Battle of the Labyrinth was initially referred to as Percy 4 until the title was officially revealed. The novel was teased by Rick Riordan behind the pages of its predecessor, The Titan's Curse. It was based on the Greek myth of the labyrinth, where the Minotaur was supposedly kept. In his book, Riordan made the labyrinth grow to cover the entire undergrowth of United States. On October 4, 2007, Publishers Weekly revealed the book's title along with the cover art by John Rocco. A preview of the book was read out for kids to judge, and the reactions were \\"unbelievable\\", according to the author. Riordan went on a tour to promote the book. He revealed that he would read a sneak peek of the first chapter at Barnes & Noble, Utah. In January 2008, he read a sneak peek of the first chapter. A trailer video was also uploaded on YouTube. In the same year, in February, an advertisement video was officially released. Riordan was bothered with the previous novel's plot leaking out due to advance reader copies (ARC) and as a result, the novel had no ARC prints. A month before the novel's release, Riordan revealed his tour plans. Shortly after the book's publication, Riordan spoke at the May 30 Evening with Children's Booksellers, as part of the 2008 BookExpo America. At this time, the Percy Jackson series was the third bestselling children's book series in America, behind the Twilight Saga and The Clique series, according to Publishers Weekly. Release The Battle of the Labyrinth was first published as a hardcover in the United States on May 6, 2008 by Hyperion Books for Children, an imprint of Disney Publishing Worldwide, and had a first printing of about one million copies. On May 13, 2008, a ten-hour and 32 minute audiobook version of The Battle of the Labyrinth, read by actor Jesse Bernstein, who also read the audiobooks of the previous 3 books in the series, was published worldwide by Listening Library. The novel was also on the Amazon Children's bestseller list and the Publishers Weekly Facts and Figures bestseller list, having sold nearly 105,000 copies in 2010 since its release in 2008. It was released in the United Kingdom with new covers. Since its release, The Battle of the Labyrinth has been translated into Bulgarian, Catalan (Valencian), Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese. Although many non-English editions used John Rocco's cover art, a fewand the Puffin editionshave unique covers by other illustrators. The book received a Lexile score of 590L, making it age- and difficulty-appropriate for the average of 10-13 year-old. Scholastic suggests the book for grades 6-12. VOYA recommended the novel for children in grades 7-12.  Reception  The Battle of the Labyrinth received mostly positive reviews. It has been praised as an excellent continuation to the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series as well as an excellent novel in its own right. Kirkus Reviews, for example, in its starred review, called the novel \\"[Riordan's] best one yet...[it] rivals Rowling for inventive, magical storytelling. The often-philosophical tale zips along with snappy dialogue, humor and thrilling action... This volume can stand alone, but no reader will be able to read just one.\\" Children's Literature made similar claims: \\"Riordan creates a masterful weaving of Greek mythology and traditional fantasy in this latest book... Fans will enjoy the latest adventures of their favorite characters, and those picking the book up for the first time will have no trouble falling into this magical world.\\" Other reviews focused more on the novel as a continuation to the series. Anita Burkam of Horn Book Magazine said in her review of the novel, \\"The melding of Greek myths with modern-day settings remains fresh and funny in this fourth installment\\". David Goodale of VOYA also remarks on Riordan's ability to \\"keep the material fresh\\" despite the \\"far-from-new\\" quest format. Publishers Weeklys starred review states, \\"One of Riordan's strengths is the wry interplay between the real and the surreal\\", adding, \\"the wit, rousing swordplay and breakneck pace [in this installment] will once again keep kids hooked.\\" The website KidsReads similarly praised the book, saying \\"the story arc has remained unified and compelling.\\" The Los Angeles Times gave another positive review, calling it \\"a glorious, no-holds-barred adventure with great plot twists, a melding of ancient and bionic technology and a cliffhanger ending that will have fans eagerly awaiting the fifth and final showdown between gods and monsters next year.\\" Matt Berman of Common Sense Media was one of few reviewers to mention the differences between this book and preceding ones in the series. He highlights The Battle of the Labyrinths darker tone, more mature themes, and increased discussion of what it philosophically means for the characters to follow and support the Greek gods and Titans. He concludes, \\"Up until now the series has been great fun, but little more. Now as it begins to grow, like the Labyrinth, larger and deeper and more complex, it's even more fun.\\" Despite the overall praise, some reviewers were more critical. School Library Journal wrote that \\"[l]ike many series, the \\"Percy Jackson\\" books are beginning to show the strain of familiarity and repetition.\\" The BBC Children Newsround praised the novel for its smart ideas, but criticized it for the lack of flow, writing, \\"none of it will make sense if you haven't read any of the other books.\\" Nelda Brangwin of Library Media Connection wrote, \\"If this is the only book read in the series, readers may be confused by the storyline and profusion of mythological creatures. It reads well on its own if readers are familiar with mythology, but is best if the other three books are in the library collection.\\" The Battle of the Labyrinth was nominated for the 2010 Indian Paintbrush Book Award, earning the second position. VOYAs highlighted review gave it a 4/5 for quality and 5/5 for popularity. The audiobook was also well received. AudioFile magazine praised the audiobook, raving, \\"Speedy introductions of familiar and new characters and previous plot summaries may briefly confuse a new listener, but fans will savor them,\\" adding \\"Jesse Bernstein is on target whether he's narrating blow-by-blow accounts of Percy's sword fights or inventing cameos for various other characters: Hephaestus, who repairs a Toyota; an aged Daedalus; and Grover, Percy's slow-witted sidekick. Bernstein is just as skillful at wringing humor from the witty dialogue and from the contrasts between the modern and ancient worlds.\\" Booklist similarly praised Bernstein's familiarity with the series and ability to realistically portray its teenaged protagonists, commenting, \\"His portrayal of Percy stands out as he manages to sound just like a 15-year-old boy.\\" The work's review in The School Library Journal was also favorable, praising Bernstein for \\"[doing] a good job voicing Percy and his Cyclops half-brother\\" and \\"successfully [conveying] Annabeth's emotions\\". He attempts a number of different accents for the gods, demigods, and mortals in the story with varying levels of success.\\"  Sequel  The sequel to The Battle of the Labyrinth is titled The Last Olympian and was released 5 May 2009. It is the final novel in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. The Last Olympian was No. 1 on the USA Today bestseller list.

A Bohemian fief from 1329, it was ruled by the Silesian Piasts until their extinction in 1675. Its capital was Brzeg in Lower Silesia. History When the Piast duke Henry V of Wroc≈Çaw and Legnica died in 1296, his sons and heirs were still minors and his estates were ruled by their uncle Duke Bolko I the Strict of ≈öwidnica, succeeded by their maternal uncle King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia in 1301 and by the Wroc≈Çaw bishop Henryk z Wierzbnej in 1305. Finally in 1311, Henry's bequests were divided among his sons: Boles≈Çaw III the Generous, the eldest brother, received the southeastern lands around Brzeg and Grodk√≥w. Brzeg Castle Soon after however, Boles≈Çaw insisted on his rights as the firstborn son and ousted his younger brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw from the Duchy of Legnica. He maintained good relations with his brother-in-law, the Luxembourg king John of Bohemia, and declared himself a Bohemian vassal in 1329. The duchy was re-united with the Duchy of Legnica in 1419, then fragmented again, and united once more with Legnica under Duke Christian in 1664. When the Kingdom of Bohemia was inherited by the Habsburg dynasty of Austria in 1526, the duchy fell under their overlordship as Bohemian kings, although it was still ruled as a lien by the Silesian Piasts. In 1537 Duke Frederick II concluded a treaty with Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg, whereby the Hohenzollern dynasty would inherit the duchy upon the extinction of the Silesian Piasts. This agreement however was rejected by the Bohemian king Ferdinand I of Habsburg and did not come into effect. Together with Legnica, Brzeg was the last autonomous duchy of Silesia. Following the death of the last Piast duke George William in 1675, it was administered directly by the House of Habsburg in dynasty's capacity as Kings of Bohemia. However Brandenburg-Prussia also claimed the duchy, referring to the old inheritance treaty of 1537. Nevertheless, the Habsburg Monarchy again refused to acknowledge the validity of this agreement and annexed the duchies. Several decades later King Frederick II of Prussia used the dispute as a pretext to justify his campaign during the First Silesian War in 1740.

Sign with skull on Tarawa December 1943 Hospital sign warning about neglect of atabrine treatment, Guinea World War II During World War II, some members of the United States military mutilated dead Japanese service personnel in the Pacific theater. The mutilation of Japanese service personnel included the taking of body parts as \\"war souvenirs\\" and \\"war trophies\\". Teeth and skulls were the most commonly taken \\"trophies\\", although other body parts were also collected. The phenomenon of \\"trophy- taking\\" was widespread enough that discussion of it featured prominently in magazines and newspapers, and Franklin Roosevelt himself was reportedly given, by U.S. Representative Francis E. Walter, a gift of a letter-opener made of a Japanese soldier's arm (Roosevelt later ordered that the gift be returned and called for its proper burial). The news was also widely reported to the Japanese public, where the Americans were portrayed as \\"deranged, primitive, racist and inhuman\\". This compounded by a previous Life magazine picture of a young woman with a skull trophy was reprinted in the Japanese media and presented as a symbol of American barbarism, causing national shock and outrage.Dickey, Colin: Afterlives of the Saints The behavior was officially prohibited by the U.S. military, which issued additional guidance as early as 1942 condemning it specifically. Nonetheless, the behavior was hard to prosecute and it continued throughout the war in the Pacific theater, and has resulted in continued discoveries of \\"trophy skulls\\" of Japanese combatants in American possession, as well as American and Japanese efforts to repatriate the remains of the Japanese dead. Trophy-taking PT-341, Alexishafen, New Guinea, April 30, 1944 A number of firsthand accounts, including those of American servicemen, attest to the taking of \\"trophies\\" from the corpses of Imperial Japanese troops in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Historians have attributed the phenomenon to a campaign of dehumanization of the Japanese in the U.S. media, to various racist tropes latent in American society, to the depravity of warfare under desperate circumstances, to the inhuman cruelty of Imperial Japanese forces, lust for revenge, or any combination of those factors. The taking of so-called \\"trophies\\" was widespread enough that, by September 1942, the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet ordered that \\"No part of the enemy's body may be used as a souvenir\\", and any American servicemen violating that principle would face \\"stern disciplinary action\\".Paul Fussell. Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War. 1990, page 117 Trophy skulls are the most notorious of the souvenirs. Teeth, ears and other such body parts were occasionally modified, for example by writing on them or fashioning them into utilities or other artifacts. Eugene Sledge relates a few instances of fellow Marines extracting gold teeth from the Japanese, including one from an enemy soldier who was still alive. > But the Japanese wasn't dead. He had been wounded severely in the back and > couldn't move his arms; otherwise he would have resisted to his last breath. > The Japanese's mouth glowed with huge gold-crowned teeth, and his captor > wanted them. He put the point of his kabar on the base of a tooth and hit > the handle with the palm of his hand. Because the Japanese was kicking his > feet and thrashing about, the knife point glanced off the tooth and sank > deeply into the victim's mouth. The Marine cursed him and with a slash cut > his cheeks open to each ear. He put his foot on the sufferer's lower jaw and > tried again. Blood poured out of the soldier's mouth. He made a gurgling > noise and thrashed wildly. I shouted, \\"Put the man out of his misery.\\" All I > got for an answer was a cussing out.

But they also found a lot of pictures of > Marines that had been cut up and mutilated on Wake Island. The next thing > you know there are Marines walking around with Jap ears stuck on their belts > with safety pins.

Peleliu October 1944 Another example of mutilation was related by Ore Marion, a U.S. Marine who suggested, > We learned about savagery from the Japanese ... But those sixteen-to- > nineteen-year old kids we had on the Canal were fast learners ...

We live like animals, we eat and are treated like animals‚Äìwhat > the fuck do you expect?' On February 1, 1943, Life magazine published a photograph taken by Ralph Morse during the Guadalcanal campaign showing a severed Japanese head that U.S. Marines had propped up below the gun turret of a tank. Life received letters of protest from people \\"in disbelief that American soldiers were capable of such brutality toward the enemy.\\" The editors responded that \\"war is unpleasant, cruel, and inhuman. And it is more dangerous to forget this than to be shocked by reminders.\\" However, the image of the severed head generated less than half the number of protest letters that an image of a mistreated cat in the very same issue received.\\"War, Journalism, and Propaganda\\" Years later, Morse recounted that when his platoon came upon the tank with the head mounted on it, the sergeant warned his men not to approach it as it might have been set up by the Japanese in order to lure them in for a look. He feared that the Japanese might have a mortar tube zeroed in on it. Morse recalled the scene in this way, \\"'Everybody stay away from there,' the sergeant says, then he turns to me. 'You,' he says, 'go take your picture if you have to, then get out, quick.' So I went over, got my pictures and ran like hell back to where the patrol had stopped.\\" In October 1943, the U.S. High Command expressed alarm over recent newspaper articles, for example one where a soldier made a string of beads using Japanese teeth, and another about a soldier with pictures showing the steps in preparing a skull, involving cooking and scraping of the Japanese heads. In 1944, the American poet Winfield Townley Scott was working as a reporter in Rhode Island when a sailor displayed his skull trophy in the newspaper office. This led to the poem The U.S. sailor with the Japanese skull, which described one method for preparation of skulls (the head is skinned, towed in a net behind a ship to clean and polish it, and in the end scrubbed with caustic soda). Charles Lindbergh refers in his diary entries to several instances of mutilations. For example, in the entry for August 14, 1944, he notes a conversation he had with a Marine officer, who claimed that he had seen many Japanese corpses with an ear or nose cut off. In the case of the skulls however, most were not collected from freshly killed Japanese; most came from already partially or fully skeletonised Japanese bodies. Lindbergh also noted in his diary his experiences from an air base in New Guinea, where according to him the troops killed the remaining Japanese stragglers \\"as a sort of hobby\\" and often used their leg-bones to carve utilities. Moro Muslim guerillas on Mindanao fought against Japan in World War II. The Moro Muslim Datu Pino sliced the ears off Japanese soldiers and cashed them in with the American guerilla leader Colonel Fertig at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and 20 centavos.Keats 1990, p. 285.McClintock 1992, p. 93.Tucci 2009, p. 130. =Extent of practice= According to Weingartner it is not possible to determine the percentage of U.S. troops that collected Japanese body parts, \\"but it is clear that the practice was not uncommon\\". According to Harrison only a minority of U.S. troops collected Japanese body parts as trophies, but \\"their behaviour reflected attitudes which were very widely shared\\". According to Dower, most U.S. combatants in the Pacific did not engage in \\"souvenir hunting\\" for bodyparts. The majority had some knowledge that these practices were occurring, however, and \\"accepted them as inevitable under the circumstances\\". The incidence of soldiers collecting Japanese body parts occurred on \\"a scale large enough to concern the Allied military authorities throughout the conflict and was widely reported and commented on in the American and Japanese wartime press\\". The degree of acceptance of the practice varied between units. Taking of teeth was generally accepted by enlisted men and also by officers, while acceptance for taking other body parts varied greatly. In the experience of one serviceman turned author, Weinstein, ownership of skulls and teeth were widespread practices. When interviewed by researchers former servicemen have related to the practice of taking gold teeth from the dead ‚Äì and sometimes also from the living ‚Äì as having been widespread.Film exposes Allies' Pacific war atrocities Horrific footage shot during battle with Japanese shows execution of wounded and bayoneting of corpses. Jason Burke The Observer, Sunday June 3, 2001 There is some disagreement between historians over what the more common forms of \\"trophy hunting\\" undertaken by U.S. personnel were. John W. Dower states that ears were the most common form of trophy that was taken, and skulls and bones were less commonly collected. In particular he states that \\"skulls were not popular trophies\\" as they were difficult to carry and the process for removing the flesh was offensive. This view is supported by Simon Harrison. In contrast, Niall Ferguson states that \\"boiling the flesh off enemy [Japanese] skulls to make souvenirs was not an uncommon practice. Ears, bones and teeth were also collected\\". The collection of Japanese body parts began quite early in the campaign, prompting a September 1942 order for disciplinary action against such souvenir taking. Harrison concludes that since this was the first real opportunity to take such items (the Battle of Guadalcanal), \\"Clearly, the collection of body parts on a scale large enough to concern the military authorities had started as soon as the first living or dead Japanese bodies were encountered.\\" When Charles Lindbergh passed through customs at Hawaii in 1944, one of the customs declarations he was asked to make was whether or not he was carrying any bones. He was told after expressing some shock at the question that it had become a routine point. This was because of the large number of souvenir bones discovered in customs, also including \\"green\\" (uncured) skulls. In 1984, Japanese soldiers' remains were repatriated from the Mariana Islands. Roughly 60 percent were missing their skulls. Likewise it has been reported that many of the Japanese remains on Iwo Jima are missing their skulls. It is possible that the souvenir collection of remains continued into the immediate post-war period. =Context= According to Simon Harrison, all of the \\"trophy skulls\\" from the World War II era in the forensic record in the U.S., attributable to an ethnicity, are of Japanese origin; none come from Europe (a seemingly rare exception to this rule was the case of a German soldier scalped by an American soldier, falsely attributed to a Winnebago tribal custom,\\"The taking and displaying of human body parts as trophies by Amerindians,\\" Chacon and Dye, page 625 films shot by the Special Film Project 186Chasing Hitler YouTube near Prague, Czechoslovakia, on May 8, 1945, display an M4 Sherman with a skull and bones fixed to it). Skulls from World War II, and also from the Vietnam War, continue turning up in the U.S., sometimes returned by former servicemen or their relatives, or discovered by police. According to Harrison, contrary to the situation in average head-hunting societies, the trophies do not fit in American society. The taking of the objects was socially accepted at the time, but after the war, when the Japanese in time became seen as fully human again, the objects for the most part became seen as unacceptable and unsuitable for display. Therefore, in time they and the practice that had generated them were largely forgotten. Australian soldiers also mutilated Japanese bodies at times, most commonly by taking gold teeth from corpses. That was officially discouraged by the Australian Army. Johnston states that \\"one could argue that greed rather than hatred was the motive\\" for this behavior, but \\"utter contempt for the enemy was also present.\\" Australians are also known to have taken gold teeth from German corpses, \\"but the practice was obviously more common in the South-West Pacific\\". \\"The vast majority of Australians clearly found such behaviour abhorrent, but \\"some of the soldiers who engaged in it were not 'hard cases'. According to Johnston, Australian soldiers' \\"unusually murderous behavior\\" towards their Japanese opponents (such as killing prisoners) was caused by \\"racism\\", a lack of understanding of Japanese military culture (which also considered the enemy, specially those who surrendered as unworthy of compassion) and, most significantly, a desire to take revenge against the murder and mutilation of Australian prisoners and native New Guineans during the Battle of Milne Bay and subsequent battles. From the Burma Campaign, there are recorded instances of Commonwealth troops removing gold teeth and displaying Japanese skulls as trophies.T. R. Moreman \\"The jungle, the Japanese and the British Commonwealth armies at war, 1941‚Äì45\\", p. 205 Motives=Dehumanization= U.S. government propaganda poster from WWII featuring a Japanese soldier depicted as a rat In the U.S., there was a widely propagated view that the Japanese were subhuman. There was also popular anger in the U.S. at the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, amplifying pre-war racial prejudices. The U.S. media helped propagate this view of the Japanese, for example describing them as \\"yellow vermin\\". In an official U.S. Navy film, Japanese troops were described as \\"living, snarling rats\\". Japanese were alternatively described and depicted as \\"mad dogs\\", \\"yellow vermin\\", termites, apes, monkeys, insects, reptiles and bats etc. The mixture of underlying American racism, which was added to by U.S. wartime propaganda, hatred caused by the Japanese war of aggression, and both real and also fabricated Japanese atrocities, led to a general loathing of the Japanese. Although there were objections to the mutilation from among other military jurists, \\"to many Americans the Japanese adversary was no more than an animal, and abuse of his remains carried with it no moral stigma\\". According to Niall Ferguson: \\"To the historian who has specialized in German history, this is one of the most troubling aspects of the Second World War: the fact that Allied troops often regarded the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians‚Äîas Untermenschen.\\" Since the Japanese were regarded as animals, it is not surprising that Japanese remains were treated in the same way as animal remains. Simon Harrison comes to the conclusion in his paper, \\"Skull trophies of the Pacific War: transgressive objects of remembrance\\", that the minority of U.S. personnel who collected Japanese skulls did so because they came from a society that placed much value in hunting as a symbol of masculinity, combined with a de-humanization of the enemy. War correspondent Ernie Pyle, on a trip to Saipan after the invasion, claimed that the men who actually fought the Japanese did not subscribe to the wartime propaganda: \\"Soldiers and Marines have told me stories by the dozen about how tough the Japs are, yet how dumb they are; how illogical and yet how uncannily smart at times; how easy to rout when disorganized, yet how brave ... As far as I can see, our men are no more afraid of the Japs than they are of the Germans. They are afraid of them as a modern soldier is afraid of his foe, but not because they are slippery or rat-like, but simply because they have weapons and fire them like good, tough soldiers.\\" =Brutalization= Some writers and veterans state that body parts trophy and souvenir taking was a side effect of the brutalizing effects of a harsh campaign. Harrison argues that, while brutalization could explain part of the mutilations, it does not explain servicemen who, even before shipping off for the Pacific, proclaimed their intention to acquire such objects. According to Harrison, it also does not explain the many cases of servicemen collecting the objects as gifts for people back home. Harrison concludes that there is no evidence that the average serviceman collecting this type of souvenirs was suffering from \\"combat fatigue.\\" They were normal men who felt that was what their loved ones wanted them to collect for them. Skulls were sometimes also collected as souvenirs by non-combat personnel. A young Marine recruit, who had arrived on Saipan with his buddy Al in 1944, after the island was secure, provides an eyewitness account. After a brief firefight the night before, he and a small group of other Marines find the body of a straggler who had apparently shot himself: > I would have guessed that the dead Japanese was only about fourteen years > old and there he lay dead. My thoughts turned to some mother back in Japan > who would receive word that her son had been killed in battle. Then one of > the Marines, who I found out later had been through other campaigns, reached > over and roughly grabbed the Japanese soldier by the belt and ripped his > shirt off. Somebody said, 'What are you looking for?' And he said, 'I'm > looking for a money belt. Japs always carry money belts.' Well, this Jap > didn't. Another Marine veteran of combat saw that the dead soldier had some > gold teeth, so he took the butt of his rifle and banged him on the jaw, > hoping to extract the gold teeth. Whether he did or not I don't know, > because at that point I turned around and walked away. I went over to where > I thought no one would see me and sat down. Although my eyes were dry, > inside my heart was wrenching, not at seeing the dead soldier, but at seeing > the way some of my comrades had treated that dead body. That bothered me a > great deal. Pretty soon Al came over and sat down beside me and put his arm > around my shoulder. He knew what I was feeling. When I turned to look at Al > he had tears running down his face.Bruce Petty, Saipan: Oral Histories of > the Pacific War, McFarland & Company, Inc., 2002, , p 119 =Revenge= News of the Bataan Death March sparked outrage in the US, as shown by this propaganda poster Bergerud writes that U.S. troops' hostility towards their Japanese opponents largely arose from incidents in which Japanese soldiers committed war crimes against Americans, such as the Bataan Death March and other incidents conducted by individual soldiers. For instance, Bergerud states that the U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal were aware that the Japanese had beheaded some of the Marines captured on Wake Island prior to the start of the campaign. However, that type of knowledge did not necessarily lead to revenge mutilations. One Marine states that they falsely thought the Japanese had not taken any prisoners at Wake Island and so as revenge, they killed all Japanese that tried to surrender.Stanley Coleman Jersey \\"Hell's islands: the untold story of Guadalcanal\\", p. 169, 170 (See also: Allied war crimes during World War II.) According to one Marine, the earliest account of U.S. troops wearing ears from Japanese corpses took place on the second day of the Guadalcanal Campaign in August 1942 and occurred after photos of the mutilated bodies of Marines on Wake Island were found in Japanese engineers' personal effects. The account of the same Marine also states that Japanese troops booby-trapped some of their own dead as well as some dead Marines and also mutilated corpses; the effect on Marines being \\"We began to get down to their level\\". According to Bradley A. Thayer, referring to Bergerud and interviews conducted by Bergerud, the behaviors of American and Australian soldiers were affected by \\"intense fear, coupled with a powerful lust for revenge\\". Weingartner writes, however, that U.S. Marines were intent on taking gold teeth and making keepsakes of Japanese ears already while they were en route to Guadalcanal. =Souvenirs and bartering= Factors relevant to the collection of body parts were their economic value, the desire both of the \\"folks back home\\" for a souvenir and of the servicemen themselves to have a keepsake when they returned home. Some of the collected souvenir bones were modified: turned into letter-openers, and may be an extension of trench art. Pictures showing the \\"cooking and scraping\\" of Japanese heads may have formed part of the large set of Guadalcanal photographs sold to sailors which were circulating on the U.S. West-coast. According to Paul Fussel, pictures showing this type of activity, i.e. boiling human heads, \\"were taken (and preserved for a lifetime) because the Marines were proud of their success\\". According to Weingartner, some of the U.S. Marines who were about to take part in the Guadalcanal Campaign were already while they were en route looking forward to collecting Japanese gold teeth for necklaces and to preserving Japanese ears as souvenirs. In many cases (and unexplainable by battlefield conditions) the collected body parts were not for the use of the collector but instead meant to be gifts to family and friends at home, in some cases as the result of specific requests from home. Newspapers reported of cases such as a mother requesting permission for her son to send her an ear or a bribed chaplain that was promised by an underage youth \\"the third pair of ears he collected.\\" A better-known example of those servicemen who left for battle already planning to send home a trophy is the Life Magazine picture of the week, whose caption begins: > When he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of > Phoenix, Ariz., a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last > week Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 > friends.... Another example of that type of press is Yank, which, in early 1943, published a cartoon showing the parents of a soldier receiving a pair of ears from their son. In 1942, Alan Lomax recorded a blues song where a soldier promises to send his child a Japanese skull, and a tooth. Harrison also makes note of the Congressman that gave President Roosevelt a letter-opener carved out of bone as examples of the social range of these attitudes. Skull stewing-Pacific War Trade sometimes occurred with the items, such as \\"members of the Naval Construction Battalions stationed on Guadalcanal selling Japanese skulls to merchant seamen\\" as reported in an Allied intelligence report from early 1944. Sometimes teeth (particularly the less common gold teeth) were also seen as a tradable commodity. U.S. reaction \\"Stern disciplinary action\\" against human remains souvenir taking was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet as early as September 1942. In October 1943 General George C. Marshall radioed General Douglas MacArthur about \\"his concern over current reports of atrocities committed by American soldiers\\". In January 1944 the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a directive against the taking of Japanese body parts. Simon Harrison writes that directives of this type may have been effective in some areas, \\"but they seem to have been implemented only partially and unevenly by local commanders\\". Life Magazine Picture of the Week, \\"Arizona war worker writes her Navy boyfriend a thank-you-note for the Jap skull he sent her\\" On May 22, 1944, Life Magazine published a photo of an American girl with a Japanese skull sent to her by her naval officer boyfriend.The image depicts a young blond at a desk gazing at a skull. The caption says: \\"When he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of Phoenix, Ariz., a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last week Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 friends, and inscribed: \\"This is a good Jap ‚Äì a dead one picked up on the New Guinea beach.\\" Natalie, surprised at the gift, named it Tojo. The armed forces disapprove strongly of this sort of thing. The letters Life received from its readers in response to this photo were \\"overwhelmingly condemnatory\\" and the Army directed its Bureau of Public Relations to inform U.S. publishers that \\"the publication of such stories would be likely to encourage the enemy to take reprisals against American dead and prisoners of war\\". The junior officer who had sent the skull was also traced and officially reprimanded. This was, however, done reluctantly, and the punishment was not severe. The Life photo also led to the U.S. Military taking further action against the mutilation of Japanese corpses. In a memorandum dated June 13, 1944, the Army JAG asserted that \\"such atrocious and brutal policies\\" in addition to being repugnant also were violations of the laws of war, and recommended the distribution to all commanders of a directive pointing out that \\"the maltreatment of enemy war dead was a blatant violation of the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded, which provided that: After each engagement, the occupant of the field of battle shall take measures to search for the wounded and dead, and to protect them against pillage and maltreatment.\\" Such practices were in addition also in violation of the unwritten customary rules of land warfare and could lead to the death penalty. The Navy JAG mirrored that opinion one week later, and also added that \\"the atrocious conduct of which some U.S. servicemen were guilty could lead to retaliation by the Japanese which would be justified under international law\\". Notably Japan did not ratify the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded (although they signed it), and such statements focus on the danger of Japanese reprisals, using the non-committal \\"could\\" to discuss potential prosecution. On June 13, 1944, the press reported that President Roosevelt had been presented with a letter-opener made out of a Japanese soldier's arm bone by Francis E. Walter, a Democratic congressman. Supposedly, the president commented, \\"This is the sort of gift I like to get\\", and \\"There'll be plenty more such gifts\\". Several weeks later it was reported that it had been given back with the explanation that the President did not want this type of object and recommended it be buried instead. In doing so, Roosevelt was acting in response to the concerns which had been expressed by the military authorities and some of the civilian population, including church leaders. In October 1944, the Right Rev. Henry St. George Tucker, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, issued a statement which deplored \\"'isolated acts of desecration with respect to the bodies of slain Japanese soldiers and appealed to American soldiers as a group to discourage such actions on the part of individuals\\". Japanese reaction News that President Roosevelt had been given a bone letter-opener by a congressman was widely reported in Japan. The Americans were portrayed as \\"deranged, primitive, racist and inhuman\\". That reporting was compounded by the previous May 22, 1944, Life magazine picture of the week publication of a young woman with a skull trophy, which was reprinted in the Japanese media and presented as a symbol of American barbarism, causing national shock and outrage.Dickey, Colin: Afterlives of the Saints Edwin P. Hoyt in Japan's War: The Great Pacific Conflict argues that two U.S. media reports of Japanese skulls and bones being sent home were exploited by Japanese propaganda very effectively, coupled to the Shinto religion, which places much higher emotional value on the treatment of human remains contributed to a preference to death over surrender and occupation, shown, for example, in the mass civilian suicides on Saipan and Okinawa after the Allied landings.Hoyt (1987), pp. 357‚Äì361 According to Hoyt, \\"The thought of a Japanese soldier's skull becoming an American ashtray was as horrifying in Tokyo as the thought of an American prisoner used for bayonet practice was in New York.\\"Hoyt (1987), pp. 358  Aftermath  Some historians argue that a similar pattern of Asian dehumanization persisted in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, even though, like World War II, Asians were on both sides of those wars. In Vietnam, the supposed \\"Mere Gook Rule\\" allowed soldiers to harm or kill South Vietnamese citizens with little fear of punishment.

In 1898, Morris Jeger, a Jewish anarchist from Liverpool and owner of a small printing shop, persuaded Rudolf Rocker and his common-law wife Milly Witkop to move to the city after Rocker was unable to find employment in London. Once there, Jeger also convinced the German-born anarchist to edit the Yiddish newspaper Dos Fraye Vort. Rocker objected that he neither spoke the language, nor knew much about the Jewish anarchist movement in England, although he had spent some time with Jewish anarchists in Whitechapel, London. Jeger offered to translate Rocker's articles from German. Dos Fraye Vort consisted of no more than four pages and had a circulation of just a few hundred copies. It was first published in late July 1898 becoming England's sole Yiddish anarchist periodical, as London's Arbeter Fraynd had stopped appearing for lack of funds. The paper was received well by the British Jewish anarchists, but Rocker was not happy with it, in part because Jeger smuggled in many of his own thoughts while translating Rocker's writings. After just four or five editions of Dos Fraye Vort had been published, Rocker received an invitation from Thomas Eyges, the secretary of the Arbeter Fraynd committee, who was impressed by the job Rocker did with the Liverpool paper, to return to London and become the editor of the revived Arbeter Fraynd. Rocker could not reject the offer. Thus the last edition of Dos Fraye Vort, its eighth, was published on 17 September 1898.  References  * pg. 239. * pp. 193‚Äì194.

On the left bank of Rhine, vineyards begin immediately downstream of the Nahe River estuary and last until Koblenz. On the right bank, vineyards begin where Rheingau ends and last until 8 kilometers south of Bonn, in the Siebengebirge.J.

In reality, the situation is quite the opposite. In between 1989 and 2009 the Middle Rhine lost 36% of its total area of vines under cultivation, while the nationwide development shows a plus of 7.37% DESTATIS accessed July 23, 2014 Since the region's planted area has been shrinking for quite some time, the region's wines are hardly ever seen on export markets, and seem to be rather unknown even inside Germany. The underlying reasons are manifold. The must per hectare comparison of German wine growing regions shows that in average, the Middle Rhine ranks 3rd lowest in output per hectare with an average of 68 hl / ha between 2001 and 2012. Only Saale-Unstrut (56 hl/ha) and Saxony (45 hl/ha) yield a lower output. The nationwide average over the same time frame comes up to 91 hl/ha. Hence, in a ten-year average, the Middle Rhine region only yields 75% of the nation‚Äôs average hectolitre per hectare output. In 2012, the output per hectare was 59 hl / ha,.pdf of the DWI accessed July 23, 2014 hence even 13% less than the ten year average of the region and 35% less than the average national output for 2012. In 2013, there were greater difficulties for harvesting and production. The bad weather conditions throughout the year led to minimal output, especially for late ripening grapes like Riesling, by far the most grown variety. Many quality producers only harvested 30 hl / ha, and some producers less. Despite these low yields, the region's wines in the 2013 vintage were of a high quality, and prices remained stable and low.RomanticWine.de, accessed on July 23, 2014 From countless conversations to wine growers in and outside the area, the conclusions on the underlying reasons are various. On one side, the area is vulnerable to the climate conditions of the respective vintage year; on the other side, there is an ongoing trend to forfeit quantity for the sake of quality. The most hyped wineries all over the world get worked up on only selecting the best grapes by hand. Due to the region‚Äôs geological conditions, this is usual practice on the Middle Rhine.RomanticWine.de accessed on July 23, 2014 The difference: Prices don't quadruple because of this fact.

The company was founded in 1982. Raima develops, sells and supports in-memory and disk-based Relational Database Management Systems that can either be embedded within the application or be in a client/server mode. The company's focus is on OLTP databases with high-intensity transactional processing. Their cross- platform, small-footprint products are made to collect, store, manage and move data.  History  Raima was founded in Seattle, Washington USA in 1982 by two software engineering researchers from Boeing, Randy Merilatt and Wayne Warren, who saw the benefits that database management technology could provide for software application developers in the rapidly growing microcomputer industry. In 1984 Raima released one of the first embedded database management systems for microcomputer applications written in the C programming language. Early contracts with companies like ROLM (now part of IBM), Texas Instruments, Microsoft, ADP and others contributed to the development of the Raima Database Manager (RDM) product family. Some of the more significant Raima product releases are shown below. * 1984 - Raima releases db_VISTA (currently named, \\"RDM Embedded\\") version 1. A single-user, network-model database management system (DBMS) for C language applications on MS-DOS and Unix. * 1986 - db_VISTA version 2 is released, adding a portable (file locks stored in a lock file), multi-user DBMS with transaction level database consistency. * 1987 - db_QUERY released, providing the first SQL-like query tool for accessing a network-model database. * 1988 - db_VISTA version 3 is released, with a system-wide lock manager process that manages all file locks. * 1990 - Raima releases db_VISTA for Microsoft Windows. * 1992 - Raima Database Server version 1 (a.k.a. \\"Velocis\\" and, today, \\"RDM Server\\") is introduced, providing a client/server DBMS with record-level locking and SQL designed to be tightly integrated with sophisticated applications written in C.

The first full-featured DBMS to support the ODBC SQL API as its native SQL API. * 1996 - Velocis 1.0: Hot online backup. * 1998 - Velocis 2.1: True multi-threading, application link. * 2006 - RDM Server 7.2: Dynamic DDL. * 2009 - RDM Server 8.3: SQL triggers and enhanced join syntax. * 2010 - RDM Embedded 10.0: Multi-core computer support using Transactional File Servers with high-performance, MVCC-based read-only transactions. * 2011 - SQL for RDM Embedded 10.1. * 2012 - ODBC/JDBC/ADO.NET support for RDM 11.0. * 2013 ‚Äì RDM 12.0: Database cursors, shared memory protocol memory allocation limitation, enhanced SQL optimization support, three new data types, bulk insert API, ‚Äúdirty read‚Äù isolation level, enhanced encryption, selective replication and notification. * 2016 ‚Äì RDM 14.0: Consolidating both the source code lines and features in Raima Embedded and RDM Server into one source code in Raima Database Manager v. 14.0. RDM 14.0 includes these major features: updated in-memory support, dirty reads, R-Tree support, compression, encryption, SQL, SQL PL, and platform independence‚Äîdevelop once, deploy anywhere. RMD 14.0 includes portability options such as direct copy and paste that permit development and deployment on different target platforms, regardless of architecture or byte order. The release includes a streamlined interface that is cursor-based, extended SQL support and stored procedures that support SQL PL; it also supports ODBC (C, C++), ADO.NET (C#) and JDBC (Java). Supported development environments include Microsoft Visual Studio, Apple XCode, Eclipse and Wind River Workbench. A redesigned and optimized database file format architecture maintains ACID compliance and data safeguards, with separate formats for in-memory, on-disk or hybrid storage. File formats hide hardware platform specifics (e.g., byte ordering). Download packages include examples of RDM speed and performance benchmarks. *2018 ‚Äì RDM 14.1: This new release focuses on ease of use, portability, and speed. With Raima's new file format, you can develop once and deploy anywhere. Performance is increased by over 50-100% depending on the use case when compared to previous RDM releases. Raima has extended and improved SQL support, snapshots, and geospatial functionality. *2020 ‚Äì RDM 14.2: Continuous focus on ease of use, portability, and speed. Multi-user Focused Storage Format: the updated database file format increase database throughput through a focus on locking contention prevention. Extended and improved geospatial functionality and a newly supported REST-ful interface have been added to the database server functionality. In June, 1999 Raima was acquired by Centura Software (formerly Gupta). In the summer of 2001, the Norwegian company Birdstep Technology acquired the Raima assets from Centura and operated Raima as a separate business unit out of Seattle. In the summer of 2010, the Raima management team purchased Raima from Birdstep, forming the now privately held Raima Incorporated.  Products and services  Raima delivers and supports multiple Raima Database Manager solutions, which are designed for distributed architectures and can either be embedded and completely managed within the application, or in a client/server mode.

The actual term used in the Russian OOB is ob'yekty, which literally means 'objects'. However, in the military sense it can mean structures, and targets. One possible interpretation that can be offered to better define the use in English is that the meaning here is of the actual \\"area of responsibility\\" of the unit in terms of installations, facilities, logistic networks and other possible locations that an enemy may select to attack. In this sense the meaning is more an area-related definition then a specific location, describing the operational activity of the air unit within the realm of its responsibilities. *Western Front PVO

In the spring of 2014, an additional 10 individuals including 7 athletes, 2 contributors and 1 coach were inducted and honored at a school assembly followed by a banquet that evening. The inductees received a plaque, a commemorative medallion and a Hall of Fame logo polo shirt. At the beginning of the 2014-15 school year, several individuals including past coaches, teachers and former athletes became involved with the school's administration. As a result, a Hall of Fame Board of Directors was established and immediately began preparing for the 2015 Hall of Fame Induction. In 2016, the Board of Directors applied for and received 501c3 status (Not for Profit). It was at this point that the Board redefined the eligibility criteria and established a nomination, screening, validation and selection process. In addition, the decision was made to create a permanent display honoring the Hall of Fame members. In addition, the decision was made to create a permanent display honoring the Hall of Fame members and to locate it in the hallway of William Spoone Gymnasium. In 2016, the Hall of Fame added a Members‚Äô Brunch to honor the new inductees and unveiled the permanent Hall of Fame display. The brunch and the unveiling of the permanent display for the new inductees has been add to the Hall of Fame Alumni Weekend list of events. One other additional event will be the naming of the Hall of Fame Student-Athlete Award recipient who will be recognized and honored at the Brunch, School Assembly and at the Induction Banquet.

From Sumter, US 76 heads northeast to Florence. US 76 is the major road through Florence. It then continues east out of Florence to the small towns of Marion and Mullins, then into North Carolina. The highway is concurrent with US 301 from Florence to across the Pee Dee River. History Formerly, US 76 followed a longer route from Westminster to Pendleton. From Westminster, the old route followed S-37-13 through the Richland community, then its current alignment to SC 59 into downtown Seneca, then SC 130 out of Seneca to S-37-1, then its current alignment to SC 93 toward Clemson University, then SC 28 Business through Pendleton.

He was awarded Ekushey Padak in 1983 by the Government of Bangladesh. Early life Mazumder was born into a Jamindar family at Radhanagar in Pabna District. His father Nishendra Mazumder was an artist and dramatist. His mother used to play sitar. To nurture his interest in music his father took him to Kolkata where he first learned music from Vishmadev Chatterjee. The first Raag that he learned was ‚ÄúRaag Bhupali‚Äù. Two years later when his guru became shonnasi he came back to Pabna, but Mazumder was not satisfied and wanted to go to Lucknow to study music in Maurice Music School. But his uncle who was the patriarch (korta) of the family did not allow him to go. Instead, he brought Ustad Roghurangan Gushwami from Lucknow to teach him music at home. At home, he managed to finish the Maurice College course, but his desire to go to Lucknow made him decide to leave home. When he reached Lucknow, some Bengali boys helped to take him to the Bengali hotel. At the time, Uday Shankar and Ravi Shankar were also in that hotel. At the college, he met with his friend and fellow musician Chinmoy Lahiri. Lahiri took him to the principal of the Maurice Music School and he was admitted into the third year. Lahiri taught him music beside college classes. Later, Mazumder was attracted o Foiaz Khan and became his novice. One day when he was in a debate about a topic with Sunil, suddenly Sunil said that Mazumder could not sing. This seemed to be the turning point of his career as he challenged him and said he would become better than him in three months. After that, he continued with his rewaz (musical practice) and soon his song was faster than Sunil's. Then one day as Sunil was in a show he went and performed the Raag of Sunil faster and this made Sunil understand his fault. As he continued to prepare him for music the time of partition came closer. During that time the fees that came from home stopped and he had to struggle hard to even manage the money to return home. He mortgaged his favorite tanpura and returned to Pabna during that very turbulent period. Career Majumder came to Dhaka in 1957 and joined as a professor of Classical Music in Bulbul Lalitakala Academy. In 1963, he decided to establish a college of music with 75 taka. He performed classical music on Bangladesh Television since 1965. He had incorporated Music College into University of Dhaka and served as a Chairman of the Examination Body concerning music of Dhaka University till 1977. After the partition of India when most of his neighbors had to cross the border, he stayed for the love of his homeland, but the riches and wealth which were made over the generations were mostly looted and hunted by the miscreants. The real admirer of his talent was also nowhere to be seen as he had not had the opportunity. The toughness and loneliness at that time made him frustrated and depressed. With most of his family property long gone Mazumder had to work hard. He once even bought a camera and related equipment to run a photography business, but soon lost interest and left the business. Fighting with severe frustration and depression, Mazumder had to pass his time only with his favorite hunting. He was really fond of hunting, and according to his wife Ila Mazumder, his story would not be completed if it does not include a lot of things about his hunting.  Personal life  Mazumder was married to Ila Majumder, a classical musician. They Their child Modhumita Majumdar died in 1971. They had three sons, Partha Pratim Mojumdar, Partha Sharothi Mojumdar and Bappa Mazumder. The couple later adopted another son Partha Pratim Majumder.

It flows north from Glenshane in the Sperrin Mountains to Lough Foyle, via the settlements of Dungiven, Burnfoot, Limavady and Myroe. The River Roe's length is Ordnance Survey of Ireland: Rivers and their Catchment Basins 1958 (Table of Reference)  Etymology  The origin of the name 'Roe' is unclear. Suggestions include a Viking origin in the 8th/9th century, and the Irish 'rua', meaning 'red', i.e. the Red River. This may be a reference to the high amounts of iron found in some places along the river. The Irish government's placenames database, held by Dublin City University, identifies the Irish version of the name as . This roughly translates into English as \\"The River of Rowing\\", possibly due to common passage by oar-powered boat craft in earlier times. Geology The Roe Basin (or Roe Valley) is a wide, glacial valley. The river flows most of the way to Limavady through an open, grassy, pastoral farmland landscape before narrowing through a metamorphic rock gorge within the Roe Valley Country Park. Beyond Limavady the river widens and meanders to an estuary feeding into Lough Foyle at Myroe Levels. Due to the wide, open nature of the upper reaches of the Roe, heavy rainfall can result in large surges of water. Many lower lying fields have earth defences to prevent flooding when the river rises above its natural banks. The estuary is a feeding ground of many birds and nesting area for lapwing. Angling The Roe Valley Country Park is a popular area for fishing, with stock of salmon, sea trout and brown trout.

Campbell, review of Whitehead and Blyth 2004, Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2005.07.63 Life Strabo mentions a contemporary of his, Athenaeus of Seleucia, a Peripatetic philosopher.Strabo 14.5.4 He was for some time the leading demagogue in his native city, but afterwards came to Rome and became acquainted with Lucius Licinius Varro Murena. On the discovery of the plot which the latter, with Fannius Caepio, had entered into against Augustus, Athenaeus accompanied him in his flight. He was retaken, but pardoned by Augustus, as there was no evidence of his having taken a more active part in the plot.William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, p. 400 . He is perhaps the same person as the writer mentioned by Diodorus, a historian who mentioned Semiramis.Diodorus Siculus, 2.20.3 On Machines The treatise is addressed to Marcus Claudius Marcellus, and thus will have been composed before Marcellus' death in 23 BC (and possibly at a time when its addressee was preparing to go out on campaign). It describes a number of siege engines. Among the earlier mechanicians cited as sources by Athenaeus are Agesistratus, Diades of Pella, and Philo of Byzantium. Whitehead and Blyth analyze the treatise into a preface, a section on \\"good practice,\\" a section on \\"bad practice,\\" a section on Athenaeus' own innovations, and an epilogue \\"emphasizing preparation for war as a deterrent, and defending Athenaeus' own record against unnamed critics.\\" The work is technical but not without signs of Athenaeus' philosophical culture: \\"He comes across as a philosopher, and he expounds about time and opportunity, but also claims to be enough of a technical expert to devise new machines, and to describe old ones accurately.\\" Much of Athenaeus' work (9.4-27.6) is closely parallel to Vitruvius, De architectura 10.13-16, a fact probably to be explained by the two authors' shared reliance on a common source.Whitehead and Blyth 2004, p. 14 =Influence= The tenth-century poliorketikon of Hero of Byzantium, Parangelmata Poliorcetica, draws on Athenaeus as a source.

Early life Louise Gretchen Kink was born on April 8, 1908 in Zurich, Switzerland to storekeeper Anton Kink and his wife, Luise Heilmann. In 1912, the Kinks decided to immigrate to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, along with Anton's brother, Vinzenz, and sister, Maria. Aboard Titanic Louise and her parents boarded the as third-class passengers on April 10, 1912, at Southampton, England. Anton and his brother were in a cabin on G-Deck while his wife, sister, and daughter occupied a cabin at the ship's stern. The Titanics collision with the iceberg at 11:40 pm on April 14 woke Anton and his brother and the two ran to the ship's welldeck where they clearly saw the iceberg. They returned to their cabin and dressed, barely finishing before water began to pour into their cabin. Anton ran to his wife's cabin and woke its occupants. The entire Kink family made their way to the boat's deck, but Maria and Vinzenz were lost in the crowd. Louise and her mother were loaded into Lifeboat No. 2, but Anton had to remain on the deck. At the last minute, Anton jumped into the lifeboat as it was being lowered. In an interview appearing on April 24 in the Milwaukee Journal, Anton was quoted as saying: > \\"A sailor took my child and handed her into one of them [lifeboats]. My wife > was also helped in by the sailors. I was touched upon the shoulder and asked > to step back, whereupon my wife and child cried at the top of their voices > at my being left behind. I ducked down, broke through those standing about > and jumped into the boat as it was lowered.\\" All three survived and were picked up by the rescue ship . Vinzenz and Maria both died during the sinking and their bodies, if recovered, were never identified. Louise and her parents arrived in New York City aboard the Carpathia on April 18 and spent the first four days in St. Vincent's Hospital. Anton's uncle sent the family money to purchase train tickets to Milwaukee and they departed New York City on April 22, arriving two days later. Upon arriving in Milwaukee, Anton rented a farm where he and his family lived. In 1919, Anton and Luise divorced and Anton returned to his homeland, Graz, Austria, where he remarried. Luise herself remarried, but refused to discuss the Titanic disaster with anyone. Marriage In 1932, Louise married Harold Pope and the couple had four children. They divorced shortly after the birth of their fourth child. Later years In her later years, Pope became more involved in Titanic-related activities. Shortly after the wreck of the Titanic was discovered in 1985 at the bottom of the Atlantic, she testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, urging protection of the site as a memorial. In 1987, she joined several survivors at a convention in Wilmington, Delaware, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the great ocean liner's sinking. In 1988, she was present at another convention organized by the Titanic Historical Society held in Boston, Massachusetts, and was guest of honor in 1989 at the inaugural convention of the Titanic International Society in Philadelphia. In 1990, Louise was guest of honor on Ellis Island as a plaque remembering those lost immigrating to the United States was formally dedicated. In September 1991, she joined Halifax Mayor Ronald Wallace at the Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, for ceremonies commemorating the Titanic International Society's identification of six previously unknown Titanic victims buried there. Despite suffering from tuberculosis, arthritis and breast cancer, Louise returned to Boston yet again in 1992 to participate in the Titanic Historical Society's convention marking the 80th anniversary of the maritime disaster. In April 1992, Louise was guest of honor in New Jersey at a Titanic-related play. Death Louise died on August 25, 1992, from lung cancer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She was 84 years old. Louise is buried next to her mother at Sunnyside Cemetery in Milwaukee. The cemetery is located on Hwy 74 between Lannon and Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.

Alongside the Duchy of Siewierz, it was the only ecclesiastical duchy in the Silesian region, as it was ruled by a bishop of the Catholic Church. Nowadays its territory is divided between Poland and the Czech Republic. History Nysa Cathedral Upon his appointment as Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw in 1198, Jaros≈Çaw of Opole, elder son of the Silesian duke Boles≈Çaw I the Tall, received the territories around the town of Nysa () from his father. After Jaros≈Çaw's death in 1201, his half-brother Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia decided to leave Nysa, as well as the castellany of Otmuch√≥w, under the control of the Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw, while the rest of the late Jaros≈Çaw's Upper Silesian lands were annexed by his uncle Mieszko IV Tanglefoot in the following year. In 1290 Henry IV Probus, duke of Lower Silesia at Wroc≈Çaw, gave the bishops privileges of autonomy on their lands in Nysa, creating the legal basis for the Duchy of Nysa. Henry of Wierzbna, Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw from 1302 to 1319, was the first to actually use the title of a Duke of Nysa. The duchy in its original form only lasted until 1335, when Silesia passed to the Kingdom of Bohemia by the Treaty of Trentschin. In 1342 Bishop Przec≈Çaw of Pogorzeli swore the oath of fealty to King John the Blind and afterwards played a vital role in the negotiations for the 1348 Treaty of Namslau between John's successor Charles IV and King Casimir III the Great of Poland. Pogorzeli also significantly enlarged his territory by acquisition of Grodk√≥w (Grottkau) from Duke Boles≈Çaw III the Generous of Brzeg in 1344. For the next two hundred years, the Polish, Czech and German inhabitants of Nysa- Grodk√≥w lived in relative harmony, even during the beginnings of the Reformation as the control of the region switched between Protestant and Catholic rulers. This ended with the Thirty Years' War.Mark Salter, Jonathan Bousfield, \\"Poland\\", Rough Guides, 2002, pg. 529 The Duchy of Nysa (yellow) within Austrian Silesia The episcopate was abandoned by the bishops during the Silesian Wars. Following the First Silesian War, the 1742 Treaty of Breslau divided the principality, with the larger northern part (1231 km¬≤) including the town of Nysa becoming part of the Kingdom of Prussia and a smaller southern part (900 km¬≤) remaining with the Austrian-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1810 the Prussian part was secularized, its autonomy removed and it was incorporated into the Prussian Silesia Province. The small part remaining in the Austrian Empire was likewise secularized to the crown land of Austrian Silesia in 1850 and is today part of Czech Silesia.

Background In late July Mola¬¥s troops suffered a shortage of ammunition (having only 26,000 rounds of ammunition). Then Francisco Franco sent him large supplies of ammunition and weapons from Italy and Germany via Portugal (600,000 rounds). On August 13, Mola met Franco in Seville and decided to capture San Sebasti√°n and Ir√∫n in order to cut the Basques off from the French Border at the western end of the Pyrenees.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939. Penguin Books. London. pp. 115-116Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. pp.363-364 The campaign=Advance on San Sebastian= The campaign was initially conceived by General Emilio Mola as an advance to Ir√∫n, to cut the northern provinces off from France, and to link up with the Nationalist garrison in San Sebasti√°n that was to have seized that city. The campaign was diverted from the advance on Ir√∫n when the direct route to the town was blocked by the demolition of the bridge at Endarlatsa. When word came that the Nationalists in San Sebasti√°n were besieged in the Cuartel de Loyola, Alfonso Beorlegui diverted all his forces westward toward that town in an attempt to relieve the Nationalist garrison. Two other Nationalist columns advanced on the city from points further west with the intent of cutting it off from Biscay. Nevertheless, on 27 July, the Nationalist garrison in San Sebasti√°n surrendered.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p.312 =Advance on Irun= Following the failure to relieve the siege of the Nationalists in San Sebastian, the forces of Beorlegui resumed their advance on Ir√∫n to cut off the northern provinces of Gipuzkoa, Biscay, Santander and Asturias, from their source of arms and support in France by taking that city. On August 11 the Nationalists took Tolosa and Beorlegi seized Picoqueta, a key ridge commanding the approach to Ir√∫n. Telesforo Monzon, a Basque Nationalist, travelled to Barcelona to seek aid, but he only got 1,000 rifles, and the Basque nationalists confiscated the gold in the local branch of the Bank of Spain to buy weapons in France,Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p.364 but on August 8 the French government closed the frontier.Jackson, Gabriel. (1968). The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931-1939. Princeton University Press. Princeton. p.274 On August 17, the rebel battleship Espa√±a, the cruiser Almirante Cervera and the destroyer Velasco arrived at San Sebasti√°n and started to shell the city. After that, German Ju 52 bombers and other Italian planes bombarded on a daily basis the bordering towns of Hondarribia and Irun,Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, (2013), p. 430. as well as San Sebasti√°n. Furthermore, the Nationalists captured the republican commander in Gipuzkoa, P√©rez Garmendia. =Fall of Irun and San Sebasti√°n= Counterattack of the Republican forces in the surroundings of Irun, before its fall to the Nationalists On August 26, Beorlegi began the assault on Ir√∫n. The poorly armed and untrained leftist and Basque nationalist militias fought bravely but could not fend off the rebel push. After bloody combats, the resisting forces were overwhelmed: thousands of civilians and militia-men fled in panic across the French border on September 3, 1936.Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, (2013), p. 430. The town was occupied that day. Beorlegui was wounded, and died a month later. Enraged by their lack of ammunition, retreating anarchists burned parts the city.Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, (2013), p. 430. The Nationalists followed this up with the capture of San Sebasti√°n on September 13. The dying General Beorlegi could still preside over the parade of triumphant far-right rebel troops entering the city with no fighting. A sizable number of the city's 80,000 inhabitants fled on an exodus towards Biscay. British field-journalist George L. Steer sets the figure of the terrified population fleeing to Bilbao at 30,000.G.L. Steer (2009), p. 57 Basque Nationalist Party officials arranged for the final orderly evacuation of the city before its fall, holding back the anarchists, small in number, who were planning to wreak havoc.G.L. Steer, (2009), p. 57 Despite their evacuation, 485 were killed at the city as a result of pseudo-trials mounted by the Spanish rebel troops in the aftermath of the city's occupation up to 1943, but during the first months of occupation approximately 600 were murdered in paseos (extrajudicial executions).Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth- Century Spain, (2013), p. 431.\\"pistolero style\\", as put by Steer. Among them, Steer cites the execution of seventeen priests of Basque nationalist sympathies.G.L. Steer (2009), p. 59 The city mayor also faced summary execution. The Nationalist rebels advanced further west. They were stopped by the Republicans at Buruntza for a few days, but continued their push until the outer fringes of Biscay (Intxorta). There, the resistance of the Basque pro- republican forces, backed up with 8,000 rifles smuggled in extremis by Lezo Urreiztieta to Santander on 24 September, and the exhaustion of the Nationalists resulted in an end of the offensive until the War in the North began.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. pp.364-366 Aftermath The Nationalists conquered 1,000 square miles of terrain and many factories. Furthermore, they cut off the Basques from sympathetic France.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p.367 Then, Indalecio Prieto, the Republican minister of defense sent the Republican fleet to the northern ports in order to prevent a rebel blockade.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p.397 On occupation during September, a Comisi√≥n Gestora or Management Commission was appointed by the rebels comprising the factions involved in the military insurrection, i.e. Carlists, Falangists, and others. The Junta Carlista, the Carlist high executive body in the province, was then chaired during the first months by the local Carlist leader Antonio Arr√∫e Zarauz up to early 1937. After taking over San Sebasti√°n, speaking in the Basque language was frowned upon, and then forbidden by proclamation.G.L. Steer (2009), p. 59 Occupation was followed by harsh repression against inconvenient figures and individuals. Among them, the Basque clergy were specifically targeted and exposed to torture and rapid execution for their family ties and/or proximity to Basque nationalist proponents and ideas.Preston, Paul (2013), pp. 431-432 In general, they were searched according to blacklists put together in Pamplona. Despite occasional internal protests within the ecclesiastic hierarchy, they did not go far. A widespread purge of the clergy in Gipuzkoa was decided in the high military and ecclesiastic circles.Preston, Paul (2013), p. 432 The occupiers also purged the Provincial Council (Diputaci√≥n/Aldundia) resulting in the expulsion 1,051 civil servants and workforce, 123 of them railway operators. The hatred underlying the crackdown was evidenced by the assassination of Jos√© Ariztimu√±o 'Aitzol' (priest and major personality of the Basque cultural renaissance during the previous years), tortured and shot on 18 October in the Hernani cemetery along with other ecclesiastic and civilian victims found fleeing.Preston, Paul (2013), p. 432 See also *The Basques during wartime  Notes  Sources  * Romero, Eladi, Itinerarios de la Guerra Civil espa√±ola : gu√≠a del viajero curioso, Barcelona : Laertes, 2001, 600 p. * Barruso, Pedro, Verano y revoluci√≥n.

Blenkiron comes from the United States, and has assisted Richard Hannay. When Hannay first meets Blenkiron, it is revealed that he suffers from dyspepsia and so often drinks boiled milk, eats dry toast and fish. Subsequently he has an operation where a part of his duodenum is replaced by rubber tubing and his digestion is restored. Blenkiron often professes his wish to join the war or \\"be let into a scene of real bloodshed\\", but he confesses that he \\"has never seen anything gorier than a presidential election.\\" Blenkiron also does not seem short on money and is used to living the high life. As a consequence, when he travels through Europe as an English spy, he becomes quite comfortable living with successful German politicians and Generals. Blenkiron is a strong believer in the Christian faith and quite often comments on his faith. He often remarks that he is a \\"Neutral\\" as that he comes from the United States and is quite proud of the fact. In \\"Greenmantle\\", on meeting (Major, at that time) Richard Hannay, he pronounces the word as \\"Nootral\\", a dramatic device giving the reader a nice literary clue as to his origin in the USA and dialect. in \\"Mr Standfast\\" he also states \\"I considered that the time had come to pay for valuable \\"Noos\\" \\". Appearance Blenkiron, as described by the author, is a \\"big fellow with a fat, sallow clean shaven face.\\" He also has \\"a pair of full sleepy eyes\\".John Buchan, The Complete Richard Hannay Stories. (Wordsworth Classics, 2012). Christopher Hitchens calls him \\"a fat and rich but nonetheless brave and humorous figure\\". In the last chapter of Mr Standfast (the third Hannay Novel by Buchan) Blenkiron achieves his desire to participate in \\"a real high-class Armageddon\\". Hannay has him inspanned as a battalion-commander in British uniform, leading the actions of a scratch American Engineer-company and other emergency troops put together in a hurry. Blenkiron and his companies successfully stem at a vital time, the strong German advance towards Amiens, and so he prevents the loss of newly-dug trench lines - a loss which would mean disaster for the whole front. Evaluation According to Charles Moore, Blenkiron's presence in Greenmantle is due to the book being written with the purpose of getting the United States to join the Allies in World War I. This happened in 1917, the year after the book's publication. H. E. Taylor notes that Buchan portrays Blenkiron positively as a businessman. He suggests that Buchan \\"may have felt more comfortable delineating a positive business character as a foreign national who, by reason of his absurd pastiche accent and diction, could not in any case aspire to gentrification.\\" References Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:John Buchan characters Category:Literary characters introduced in 1916 ","title":"John S.

The PJC-1 first flew on 14 September 1937 at Alhambra, California but it crashed during an extended (more than six turn) spin test with the center of gravity ballasted to the aft limit, as it was going through the certification process‚Äîa problem generally laid at the feet the unusually rigorous spin test requirement and the government test pilot, who bailed out of the airplane after the spin \\"flattened out.\\" The airplane struck the ground, still in the \\"flat\\" (longitudinally level) attitude in a bean field near Mines Field (now Los Angeles International Airport) with considerable damage; although repairable, the PJC-1 was never returned to service. PJC students then built a slightly modified airplane, which limited aileron travel with full aft-stick and incorporated a slightly larger vertical stabilizer. This became the PJC-2 model, serial number 1 certified by the FAA on 20 May 1938. It was one of the first, if not the first, airplane designed and built in the U.S. with a stressed-skin semi-monocoque structure‚Äîa revolutionary design feature for the time.

The first wasp of this species was collected by the German natural scientist Moritz Wagner (born at Bayreuth, Bavaria, on 3 October 1813) during his expedition from Panama over Colombia to Ecuador between 1858 and 1859. The holotype specimen later was described by the nature scientist Henri de Saussure from Geneva, who named the new-found wasp Eumenes wagnerianus in honour of its finder. In 1961, the Italian biologist Antonio Giordano Soika, during his revision of the family Eumenidae, founded, at the 11th Congress of the Entomological Society in Vienna, the new genus Brachymenes and described the new species Brachymenes dyscherus. Both species are potter wasps. Their nests consist of parallel combined compartments composed of fine clay material which is later covered by a \\"roof\\" made of a more grainy structured material, to cover the exact site of the breeding compartments. B. wagnerianus always constructs six compartments in a vertical row in only one layer, in a specific pattern, while B. dyscherus nests can be much more extensive and combine several layers of breeding chambers. The species distribution is Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela for B. wagnerianus. B. dyscherus is described from Guayana, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its appearance in Colombia is uncertain. References * Giordani Soika, A. 1990. Revisione degli Eumenidi neotropicali appartenenti ai generi Pachymenes Sauss., Santamenes n. gen., Brachymenes G.

He was in financial difficulty, he believed his wife Zelda was romantically involved with another man, she had suffered a series of physical illnesses, and his play The Vegetable had been a failure.Petry, Alice Hall.

Reception Upon publication‚Äîand somewhat belying the notion that Fitzgerald's most famous novel had not been enthusiastically received‚ÄîThe New York Times wrote, \\"The publication of this volume of short stories might easily have been an anti-climax after the perfection and success of 'The Great Gatsby' of last Spring. A novel so widely praised ‚Äî by people whose recognition counts ‚Äî is stiff competition. It is even something of a problem for a reviewer to find new and different words to properly grace the occasion. It must be said that the collection as a whole is not sustained to the high excellence of 'The Great Gatsby,' but it has stories of fine insight and finished craft.\\"The New York Times, \\"Scott Fitzgerald Turns a Corner,\\" March 7, 1926.

The Nationalist Army, under Alfonso Beorlegui, captured the city of Ir√∫n cutting off the northern provinces of Gipuzkoa, Biscay, Santander, and Asturias from their source of arms and support in France. Background Ir√∫n is located on the northeastern coast of Spain, between the French border and the city of San Sebastian. Navarre, a Carlist stronghold, was taken over by the Requet√©s in late July, followed by brutal mass-repression against blacklisted civilians.Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth- Century Spain, (2013), pp. 179-183. In early August, the Carlists Colonel Jose Solchaga Zala and Colonel Alfonso Beorlegui under the orders of General Mola commanded large numbers of Requet√©s down the north of Navarre towards Ir√∫n.Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, (2013), p. 430. Colonel Beorlegui's force was smaller, but it included 155 mm artillery, German light tanks, Junkers Ju 52 bombers, and a 700-man bandera from the Spanish Foreign Legion.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1931-1939. Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.116 It also included Italian aircraft. Both Germans and Italians carried out heavy air strikes over Irun and Hondarribia (Fuenterrab√≠a) on a daily basis, at the same time dropping pamphlets over the towns threatening to repeat the massacres of Badajoz.Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, (2013), p. 430. The town was defended by 3,000 Republicans, including CNT militia, Asturian miners, Basque nationalists, and French communist volunteers. However, they were poorly armed and lacking in proper military training.Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, (2013), p. 430. The battle The Nationalist ships Espa√±a (battleship), Almirante Cervera (cruiser), and Velasco (destroyer) bombarded the town on August 11. The main fighting took place on the Puntza ridge south of the town. The peak of the battle occurred at the convent of San Marcial, which was defended by Asturian miners and militia who threw dynamite and rocks when they ran out of ammunition.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1931-1939. Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.116 The French had closed the border with Spain on August 8, leading to a shortage of ammunition and supplies on the Republican side. When the Republicans finally abandoned the town, anarchist forces in retreat enraged by their lack of ammunition set fire to parts of the town to destroy things that might aid the Nationalists.Preston, Paul, The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain, (2013), p. 430. During the duration of the war, when the Nationalists bombarded then occupied a town, they would put the blame of the destruction on the Republicans, like in Gernika (a sort of false flag operation), citing the example of Ir√∫n. Beorlegui was wounded by a sniper's bullet when he entered the town. He refused to have the wound treated and soon died from gangrene.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain.

The series ran from December 1996 to February 1997. It was a follow-up tale from the Incredible Hulk storylines \\"Ghosts of the Past\\" and Future Imperfect. The story begins a few weeks after the end of Future Imperfect with a small group of the Gravity Police (the Maestro's soldiers) wandering outside of the city. They were forced to leave the city following the fall of the Maestro and have since run out of supplies, such as food and water. The group stumbles upon a water supply, only to find the future incarnation of the Abomination. The Abomination questions the soldiers, who reveal that they are from Castle Maestro and that the Maestro himself has been presumed dead. Upon hearing this, the Abomination has his mutates attack and kill the soldiers while he heads for the now vacant Castle Maestro. Meanwhile, we are introduced to Captain Agarn, the elected ruler of the city. Rick Jones' niece Janis also ran but lost the election, which does not bother Janis as long as she is around to keep an eye on him. The rebels then discover a secret chamber with a large, silver box inside of it. While the rebels ponder if the tubes attached to the large box mean that something is alive inside, the Abomination and his mutates launch their attack on the city. The rebels counterattack but are soundly defeated. Kaspin, right hand advisor to the Abomination, senses the presence of the being in the secret chamber. Horrified, the Abomination smashes open the box to find the Shulk, the future incarnation of the She-Hulk inside. Kaspin estimates that she has been in there for at least seven years. Upon hearing this, the Abomination sets down his \\"poor Shulk\\" and in a blind rage, orders all humans to be slaughtered and that he will wipe any trace of the Maestro from the Earth. The mutates stumble upon the rebels, but are scared off by Betty #6, who claims to be a former consort of the Maestro and that she is carrying his unborn child. The scene shifts back to Castle Maestro, where the Abomination has placed Shulk in the royal bedchamber. As he watches her sleep, he remembers past events. It is revealed that the Shulk was 'almost' triumphant in combat against the Maestro. The Abomination had joined her in later battles (it is unclear if anyone else joined them in the battles), and they were defeated each time. After the Maestro murdered three villages to prove his dominance, the Shulk went after him and was never seen again. Kaspin interrupts and tells him of the woman claiming to be pregnant with the Maestro's child, and the Abomination responds by ordering her death, claiming Betty #6's carcass will make a suitable wedding gift for his long lost love. The mutates return, this time set on killing Betty #6 and her unborn child. The rebels flee, only to find themselves cornered in their old headquarters. However, they stumble upon the time machine used to bring the Professor Hulk to the future. Janis quickly sends the group of rebels back in time, while she stays behind. They find themselves in the middle of a fight between the Police and the homeless of East Village New York in the late 1990s. The rebels disarm the Police and give the guns to the homeless, but one of the rebels, Char, is shot in the process. The Police arrive with reinforcements and engage the rebels in battle. Meanwhile, Abomination questions the captured Janis about the location of Betty #6. Janis resists, but the Abomination orders Kaspin to put Janis in as much pain as possible in order to get her to talk. The Abomination leaves to check on Shulk, who awakens and violently knocks him away, furious that he has touched her. He departs, but not before reminding her that he is King and that she will be his or perish. Janis impresses Kaspin with her strength of will, and he then realizes that he will have to kill her as she will not betray her friends. Despite his loyalty to the Abomination for taking care of him after his parents deserted him, he cannot bring himself to kill and releases Janis. Back in the past, the rebels are saved by the appearance of the Abomination, who takes the rebels and homeless underground with him. In the future, the Abomination scolds Kaspin for allowing Janis to escape and orders him to retrieve her. Upon hearing this, a bounty hunter named Quarry introduces himself and offers to track down Janis. The Abomination agrees, giving Quarry three hours to find her. After he leaves, the Abomination makes another advance at Shulk, who promptly knocks him unconscious. She departs on a mission to the past, determined not to allow anyone like the Maestro to exist again. Shulk brings Kaspin with her, ordering him to locate Betty #6 so she can kill the unborn child of the Maestro. Back in the past, the Abomination scolds the homeless people he protects for venturing up to the surface as Betty #6 goes into labor with her child and Char lies dying in the tunnels. Po, a large rebel who had been knocked unconscious during the fight with the Police, awakens and is instantly angered by the site of the Abomination of the past. He grabs a pipe and attacks the Abomination, who shrugs off the attack and flings Po across the tunnel. The rebels attack, unaware that Char has died. Meanwhile, Shulk arrives in the past in great pain. Kaspin senses something wrong with her brain, but Shulk shrugs it off and burrows underground to find Betty #6. In the future, the Abomination is presented the lone surviving human, a woman who reveals herself as a cybertech. In exchange for her life, she fits him with cybernetic extensions to fix his various injuries accumulated throughout the years. In the past, Shulk finds the tunnels and is confronted by the past Abomination. The story goes back to Janis, who is being pursued by Quarry. She finds the rebels time machine and uses it to transport herself back to the past. However, Quarry jumps in during the middle of the launch and the pair disappear into the timestream, their fate unknown. In the future, the Abomination finds the old factory used by the rebels and destroys it, stranding all of them in the past. Shulk and the past Abomination do battle, and she succeeds in smashing him through the tunnel. The rebels attack Shulk to protect the baby, but are quickly defeated. She is poised to kill Betty #6, who informs Shulk that the baby is not actually the Maestro's. Betty #6 tells Shulk that it was a lie simply to save herself and the rebels from the mutates. Shulk hesitates, but is still ready to kill them when she suddenly collapses. Kaspin is the cause of her collapse, as cannot allow her to kill a helpless baby. The Abomination smashes back into the tunnel only to find Shulk near death. Shulk calls the Abomination over to her and whispers something to him that only he can hear before she dies. The Abomination buries both her and Char, but Jennifer Walters is written on the grave. It is never revealed what else she told him, but the reader is told via narration that he will often stand and her grave for hours with tears in his eyes. The rebels decided to stay underground with the homeless and the Abomination. The group renames themselves the Abominations and make trips up to the surface at night to help and fight crime.

The division was officially created on 18 August 1941.

During the course of the war, its losses were continually replaced, and thus it began to consist not only of miners from Donbass. History=Formation= The formation of the division began in August, at mine #6 in Stalino (now Donetsk). The division included six special anti-tank detachments, created by the city committee of Komsomol in Stalino. Specifically for this division, the production of mines, grenades and other anti-tank weapons in the city was drastically increased. Colonel Konstantin Provalov, graduate of the M. V. Frunze Military Academy and Hero of the Soviet Union, was appointed commander of the division. He was later promoted to Major General and commanded the Southern Group of Forces during the 1960s. \\"The right to command the newly created divisions went to people who knew and the theory and practice of military art - the graduates of the M.V.

From 15 October until 22 October, the division participated in the defense of Stalino. By that time, they had destroyed 30 tanks, four mortar batteries, two artillery batteries and had killed more than 5,000 German soldiers. By 23 October, the German Army had finally taken Stalino, and the 383rd killed another 1,500 German soldiers during its retreat. Following this defeat, the division was transferred to the Transcaucasian Front, to stop the Germans from penetrating to the oil fields of Azerbaijan. There, the division successfully held defensive positions, refusing to give up ground. In the beginning of 1943 the division fought near Novorossisk. On 7 November 1943 the division crossed the Kerch strait and landed its troops near Kerch, as part of the Kerch-Eltigen Operation.

The Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova () is a monastery in Coimbra, Portugal. It was built to replace the mediaeval Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha, located nearby, which at the time was prone to frequent flooding by the waters of the Mondego river. The monastery was built in the 17th and 18th centuries and is classified as a National Monument. It is located in the Santa Clara parish.IPPAR  History  The Monastery of Santa Clara of Coimbra was founded in the early 14th century near the river Mondego by Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, wife of King Dinis I. The queen was greatly admired during and after her life for her pious and generous nature, and was canonised in the 17th century. Through the centuries, the church and monastic buildings were repeatedly flooded by the Mondego. In the 17th century, under the rule of King John IV, it was decided that a new monastery was to be built for the religious community. Construction works began in 1649, and the church was finished by 1696. All nuns as well as the Gothic tombs of Queen Elizabeth and other royal princesses were transferred to the new monastery, therefore called \\"Santa Clara-a-Nova\\" (Saint Clare-the-New).  Architecture  The project of the monastery was entrusted to Father Jo√£o Turriano, a benedictine monk and royal engineer, who conceived the ensemble in the simple Mannerist style of 17th-century Portugal. Construction works were led by royal architect Mateus do Couto. The church, consecrated in 1696, is of rectangular floorplan, has a single-aisled nave and lacks a transept. The interior is illuminated by a series of (clerestory) windows located on the second storey of the nave. The side chapels and main chapel house a total of 14 altarpieces of gilt carved woodwork (talha dourada) in late 17th-century style. The main altarpiece, in particular, is an outstanding example of the so-called \\"national\\" style (estilo nacional). This altarpiece incorporates the tomb of the Saint Queen Elizabeth, founder of the monastery, made of silver and crystal, entrusted in 1614 to the artists Domingos Lopes and Manuel Moreira. The statue of Queen Saint Elizabeth is a 19th-century work by sculptor Ant√≥nio Teixeira Lopes. The main portal to the church, decorated with the royal coat of arms held by two angels, is located at the south fa√ßade, as was typical for convents of religious sisters in Portugal.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Shapiro earned his first screen credit for South Sea Woman in 1953. His work for Day earned him Oscar nominations for Lover Come Back and That Touch of Mink and a win for Pillow Talk, and Mink won him the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Comedy. Life and career Shapiro was born and raised in Brooklyn. He was Jewish.https://www.jewishtampa.com/jews-in-the-news/jews-in-the-news- chuck-lorre-dave-franco-and-billy-crystal He dropped out of Brooklyn College and began selling jokes to comedians. He eventually wrote for Fred Allen on radio and then for George Burns and Gracie Allen. He followed Burns and Allen to Hollywood and worked on their television show. He produced the first season of Ray Bolger's ABC sitcom, Where's Raymond?, and was replaced in the second season by Paul Henning, as the series was renamed The Ray Bolger Show. Additional writing credits include Operation Petticoat, Come September, Bedtime Story, Me, Natalie, For Pete's Sake, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, and Carbon Copy. \\"Although I find social institutions, manners, customs and prejudices a bit ridiculous, I do not regard them as a satirist\\", he told an interviewer in 1962. \\"I am a humorist. Will Rogers was a satirist, Laurel and Hardy were humorists. Believe me, humor is much harder to write. It was a lot easier for Will Rogers to get a laugh by doing a pun about the Government than it was for Laurel and Hardy to figure out a routine on how to move a piano manually from the basement to the fifth floor.\\" Shapiro's last project was the television movie Running Against Time, based on his novel A Time to Remember. Broadcast four months after his death from leukemia in Los Angeles, it was dedicated to his memory. Shapiro died on July 21, 1990, five days after his 65th birthday.

This is Turner's first solo album released after her divorce from husband Ike Turner in 1978. Her first two solo albums, Tina Turns the Country On! (1974) and Acid Queen (1975), were released while she was still a member of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Although Rough received positive critical reception, it was not a commercial success. Songs Rough is made up of mostly blues and disco cover songs with a rock influence. Just like the preceding Acid Queen, the album was an indication that Turner wanted to take her music into a rock-oriented direction. The opening track, \\"Fruits of the Night,\\" was co-written by Giorgio Moroder's longtime collaborator Pete Bellotte. Turner recorded a cover of Bob Seger's \\"Fire Down Below.\\" The album also includes Turner's first cover version of Elton John's \\"The Bitch Is Back,\\" which she re-recorded in 1991 for the tribute album Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin. \\"Viva La Money\\" was the only single released in the United States. Three additional singles were released in Europe: \\"Root Toot, Undisputable Rock & Roller,\\" \\"Sometimes When We Touch,\\" and \\"Fruits of the Night.\\" None of the singles had chart success.  Critical reception  Billboard reviewed the album as an \\"adventurous variety of old and new material,\\" adding that Turner's \\"delivery has lost none of its snap and crackle.\\" Cash Box wrote that \\"she rocks rough and randy enough to make her pop and soul competitors quiver in their lizard skin tennis shoes. Turner mixes the intensity of the gospel choir with the promised pleasures of the turned-down bed to great effect.\\" Record World noted, \\"Turner's sassy vocals are always something to behold and her newest lp is certainly no exception.\\"  Reissues  The album was re-issued on CD by EMI in the early 1990s but is currently out of print.

It is an eight-lane bridge with pedestrian lanes on both sides. A separate Washington Metro bridge carrying the Blue, Orange and Silver lines crosses over the bridge near its western terminus, and parallels the bridge on the north. A third bridge in the area carries Benning Road over Kingman Lake.  History = Stoddert's Bridge = In 1797, the state of Maryland (which then controlled the area which would later become the District of Columbia) issued a charter to Benjamin Stoddert, Thomas Law, and John Templeman to build a bridge across the Anacostia River. Stoddert owned land (known as \\"Long Meadows\\") on the eastern shore of the Anacostia River, and a bridge would have helped him develop him land. The right to build a bridge was not exercised until 1805, when Chain Bridge was swept away during floods. Stoddert then formed the Anacostia Bridge Co., and that same year erected a $20,000 wooden bridge known as Stoddert's Bridge in this location. In the 1790s, \\"Captain\\" William Benning came from Virginia and purchased of land on the western end of Stoddert's Bridge. The site was one of the first crossings over the Anacostia River. The bridge and \\"Benning's Road\\" were important eastern routes in and out of the District.Upper Marlboro-East Washington, DC Quadrangle, Northwest Quadrant, USGS (1886)(\\"Benning's Road\\" appears on 1886 USGS Map) By 1814, the bridge‚Äînow also known as \\"Upper Bridge\\"‚Äîwas in disrepair. During the War of 1812, the U.S. military commander of the Military District of Washington burned Stoddert's Bridge in an attempt to stop the British from invading the city of Washington.Lord, The Dawn's Early Light, 1994, p. 96Muller, Charles Geoffrey.

In 1975, the west bound deck was replaced. = Ethel Kennedy Bridge = The Metro and road bridges side-by-side In the late 1990s an analysis of the existing bridge showed that the bridge was unsuitable for rehabilitation and that it needed to be replaced. The replacement was broken into two bridges, with one over Kingman Lake and the other over the Anacostia. The bridge over Kingman Lake was built in 2000. In 2002-2003, the Benning Road Reconstruction Project replaced the 586-foot bridge built in 1934 with a 548-foot, 8-lane, 5-span, continuous, multi-girder bridge with steel elements masked by concrete panels to closely resemble the 1934 span. The new bridge, like the one it replaced, carries water, gas, electricity and phone lines. It also included wide sidewalks, a new pedestrian gateway to Kingman Island and connections to the RiverParks on both sides of the river. Retrieved 27 November 2019. In 2008, the District Council voted to rename the Benning Road Bridge after Ethel Kennedy, the widow of the late Robert F. Kennedy, for whom a nearby stadium was named. In a May 20, 2014 ceremony, the bridge was officially renamed the Ethel Kennedy Bridge to honor her for her devotion to many social and environmental causes during her later years, especially in the neighborhoods along and near the Anacostia River. The Bridge was inspected by the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) in 2014, and found to be structurally sound.  References  Category:Road bridges in Washington, D.C.

The architect was E. Francis Baldwin. The structure is constructed of brick, and is one and a half stories, modified rectangle in form with overhanging gabled and hipped roof sections with brackets and terra cotta cresting, and an interior chimney. There is a louvered lunette in one gable, stick work in another, and fish-scale shingling under truncated hipped section; shed shelter, segmental arched openings. It is Queen Anne in style. It is nearly identical in plan and dimensions to the Gaithersburg, Maryland station Baldwin designed, also built in 1884, although the rooflines and settings are quite different. Laurel station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, (although one source claims it was 1972) and was reopened into a MARC station when the Camden Line was established. A fire gutted the interior of the station, and damaged its roof and brick walls, in January 1992. In February 2009, Vice President Joe Biden, Governor Martin O'Malley, and Senator Ben Cardin gave a speech at Laurel Station to gain support for an economic stimulus package in Congress that would provide funding to rebuild the station platform, among many other Maryland infrastructure projects. The funding bill passed and by mid-March, construction fencing went up for an anticipated six months of work on a new platform and other station improvement.

History  The Confraternity of Catholic Saint began on 1 October 2003 as the Ministry for the Promotion of Holy Men and Women at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao dedicated to promote the new Saints of the Catholic Church. Its foundation was led by Dave Caesar Dela Cruz and Lloyd Paul Elauria, both from the said diocese. In August 2006 it changed its name to Confraternity of Catholic Saints (CCS) in the presence of the pioneer fraters of the CCS, namely (with religious name) Dave Caesar Dela Cruz (Francis Teresa Maria of the Immaculate Conception and of the Holy Cross), Lloyd Paul Elauria (Tarciso Bonaventura Maria a Croce), Weldann Lester Panganiban (John Ezekiel Maria of the Miraculous Medal and of the Cross), Matthew Taleon (Joseph Pio Maria of the Visitation of our Lady), John Felix Santos [John of Saint Mary, Mother of God], Adrian Millena (Paul Lawrence Maria of the Resurrection), Carlos Babiano (Josemaria of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary), and Roel San Miguel (John Therese Maria of the Annunciation). On 13 July 2007 Rev. Fr. Angelo Ma. S. Legal, of the Catholic (OSB) became the Spiritual Director of the CCS.

The CCS Official Manual contains the norms of the CCS, the Constitution and By-laws, and other important documents like decrees of the Director, prayers for the CCS, and letters of several Bishops. On 5 October 2008, the fifth anniversary of the Confraternity, four pioneer fraters made their solemn consecration and perpetual profession. On 6 November 2008, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints sent a message for the Confraternity, marking a step of recognition from the Congregation. The CCS is currently present in two dioceses in the Philippines, the Dioceses of Cubao and Kalookan, with Cooperators around the country. On 11 February 2009, the Confraternity had its new presence at the Holy Cross Parish, Diliman, Quezon City. In May of the same year (2009), the Community welcomed another member, in the person of Lloyd Danielle Flores (James Michael Maria of the Transfiguration of the Lord). This was in-line with the First Anniversary of the Promulgation of the CCS Manual and the recognition of the CCS Scholars for the Year 2009-2010. At the Start of the Year 2010, the Confraternity, through its director, declared the said year as the Year of Holiness. This is to reiterate the need of the CCS to fulfill its mission and motto to be Holy. With this, a Year dedicated to Mary is also declared, calling all members to call upon the Blessed Virgin Mary and ask her intercession as the Year of Holiness is observed. The official logo of the CCS  Logo and motto  The motto of the CCS is taken from the Holy Scripture in the book of the 1st epistle of Peter (1:16), \\"Sancti eritis, quia ego sanctus sum,\\" translated as \\"Be holy for I am holy.\\"Logo and Motto, CCS Official Manual, June 1, 2008 The motto describes the CCS's identity as an organization for the holiness of Christ's faithful. In the official logo, the letters C, C, and S are formed like a heart which symbolizes the ministry and core values (Commitment, Charity, and Service) of the Confraternity of Catholic Saints (CCS) being embedded in the hearts of its members. The three flames above the heart at the left symbolize the three inspirations of the Confraternity: Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, Saint Josemaria Escriva, and Saint Louis de Montfort while the larger flame at the right symbolizes Saint Therese of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face, the secondary patroness of the Confraternity. The letter \\"M\\" inside the heart symbolizes the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother and Queen of the CCS. The cross at the center of the logo symbolizes Jesus, the center and life of the Confraterity.  Ministries  The ministries of the CCS are defined according to the Constitution and By-laws given last 1 June 2008.Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution and By-laws of the CCS # To promote the devotion to and lives of the Holy Men and Women recognized by the Roman Catholic Church by Canonization, Beatification, and Recognition of Heroic Virtues, including those from the churches in communion with Rome. # To help parishes, religious congregations and associations foster devotion to their own saints (their patrons, founders, and/or members). # To take care of relics of the saints that the confraternity members and/or the Diocese owns. # To host a public viewing and veneration of the relics of saints in parishes, communities, schools, hospitals, houses, and offices. # To help the Catholic Church stop different kinds of abuses to relics of saints and report it to the competent ecclesiastical authorities (e.g. the Local Ordinary) and/or to the postulators. # To conduct spiritual activities according to the spirituality of a particular saint through seminars, recollections, retreats, pilgrimages, etc. # To visit the sick and those who need spiritual assistance and pray for them through the intercession of the saints.  Structure  The Confraternity of Catholic Saints consists of two groups these are: the Fraters Group (men who are consecrated and living within the area of Metro Manila and serving full-time the CCS' needs) and the Cooperators Group (who wish to share in the mission of the CCS cooperating in or outside the Metro Manila area). The Cooperators are the \\"Friends of Catholic Saints\\" (men) and the \\"Daughters of Mary, Queen of All Saints\\" (women). The Cooperators was established by the Director 15 October 2007 through his decree no. 1, series of 2007, given in Zagreb, Croatia.

(1966) film poster spoofs the 007 hit Thunderball. Eurospy film, or Spaghetti spy film (when referring to Italian- produced films in the genre), is a genre of spy films produced in Europe, especially in Italy, France, and Spain, that either sincerely imitated or else parodied the British James Bond spy series feature films. The first wave of Eurospy films were released in 1964, two years after the first James Bond film, Dr. No, and in the same year as the premiere of what many consider to be the apotheosis of the Bond series, Goldfinger. For the most part, the Eurospy craze lasted until around 1967 or 1968. In Italy, where most of these films were produced, this trend replaced the declining sword and sandal genre. Christopher Frayling, who estimated the number of Eurospy films at 50, felt that they passed on such traits to the Spaghetti Western as emphasis on the technology of death, such as special weapons, the anonymity of the protagonist, the \\"money = power\\" equation of the villains and humorous asides that released the audience's laughter after a violent sequence.p. 92 Frayling, Christopher. Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone, I.B. Taurus, 2006. See Karl May and Sergio Leone. For additional verisimilitude, these films often featured American and British stars in the lead roles.Blake, Matt & Deal, David. The Eurospy Guide, Luminary Press, 2004 The heroes of the films were secret agents who were often given a name similar to \\"James Bond\\" (including \\"Charles Bind\\", \\"Charles Vine\\" and \\"James Tont\\", where \\"Tont\\" is a pun on \\"tonto\\" which is Italian for \\"dumb\\", \\"stupid\\"), and/or a code name matching, or similar to, James Bond's \\"007\\". Other Eurospy films made use of existing literary fictional spies, including Bulldog Drummond, Harry Palmer, Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, AKA OSS 117 (who was not based on James Bond but rather had helped to inspire James Bond), Francis Coplan and Rolf Torring. Examples Some European stars and their films were renamed and retitled to cash in on the superspy craze. For example, Jesus Franco's or \\"Jess Frank\\"'s 1962 La Muerte silba un Blues was later retitled 077 Operation Jamaica or 077 Operation Sexy with star Conrado San Mart√≠n rechristened \\"Sean Martin\\" to evoke images of Sean Connery and Dean Martin (who played Matt Helm). Germany's fictional hero Rolf Torring's film Der Fluch des Schwarzen Rubin was retitled Agente S3S Operazione Uranio. =Continental Europe= So many French and Italian films used \\"007\\" that United Artists told the Italian film industry that only James Bond could be 007, and threatened legal action.Chapman, James. Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films, I. B. Tauris, 2007 Working around this restriction, many films were given similar, but legally acceptable, three-digit numbers in their titles such as the Italian-Spanish A 001, operazione Giamaica a.k.a. Our Man in Jamaica (1965) and the Secret Agent 077 trilogy starring Ken Clark (Agent 077 ‚Äì Mission Bloody Mary, Agent 077 From the Orient with Fury, and Special Mission Lady Chaplin). 008: Operation Exterminate (1965) from director Umberto Lenzi features the first female Bond-type hero. Lenzi also made three films starring Roger Browne, Superseven chiama Cairo (1965), Last Man to Kill (1966), and The Spy Who Loved Flowers (1966). Browne was also in Password: Kill Agent Gordon (1966). Director Bruno Corbucci's James Tont series starring Lando Buzzancap. 126 Biederman, Danny. The Incredible World of Spy-Fi: Wild and Crazy Spy Gadgets, Props and Artifacts from TV and the Movies, Chronicle Books, 2004 is the earliest Italian comedy series based on 007. James Tont operazione U.N.O. (1965) features a female character named \\"Goldsinger\\" and underwater sequences that echo Thunderball. This was quickly followed by the sequel James Tont operazione D.U.E. a.k.a. The Wacky World of James Tont (1965). Corbucci also wrote the screenplays for Kiss Kiss...Bang Bang (1966) and the Derek Flint parody Il vostro super agente Flit (1966). Another Bond spoof, Two Mafiosi Against Goldfinger, also known as The Amazing Dr. G (1965), features Fernando Rey as a criminal mastermind named Goldginger. CIA agent Bob Fleming is featured in a trio of Italian films, Secret Agent Fireball also titled Da 077: le spie uccidono a Beirut (1965), Killers are Challenged a.k.a. A 077, sfida ai killers (1966), directed by Antonio Margheriti, and Fury in Marrakesh, a.k.a. Furia a Marrakech (1966). Margheriti made one other spy film, Lightning Bolt, a.k.a.

Marie Chantal contre Dr.), and the German Kommissar X and Jerry Cotton series. France's Eddie Constantine Nick Carter and Lemmy Caution series moved into espionage with several films, including Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville (1965). The French Francis Coplan novels resulted in six films including Coplan Saves His Skin (1968). Jean Marais starred in the French-Italian The Reluctant Spy (1963) and Killer Spy (1965). Jean-Paul Belmondo was in the French spy spoof That Man From Rio (1964). American actor Ray Danton made two French films, Code Name: Jaguar (1965), Secret Agent Super Dragon (1966), and the Spanish-Italian 007 parody Lucky, el intr√©pido a.k.a. Lucky, the Inscrutable (1966) directed by Jes√∫s Franco. Franco also made The Girl from Rio (1969) with Goldfinger's Shirley Eaton in the title role. Dino De Laurentiis's international co- production Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die (1966) was filmed in Rio de Janeiro using an American director and an Anglo-American cast (Mike Connors, Terry-Thomas, et al.) and a higher budget than most Eurospy films. A touchstone of this series of films was OK Connery, a.k.a. Operation Kid Brother (1967) starring Neil Connery, brother of the then-James Bond actor Sean Connery, plus several actors from the official James Bond series. The director, Alberto De Martino, also made Special Mission Lady Chaplin (1966) and The Spy with Ten Faces (1966) with Karin Dor. She was the first German Bond girl, appearing in You Only Live Twice (1967). British actor Stewart Granger starred in Red Dragon (1965), Target for Killing (1966) with Adolfo Celi from Thunderball, and Requiem for a Secret Agent (1966) in Italy along with Daniela Bianchi. In addition to the James Bond film From Russia with Love (1963), Bianchi made the Italian spy films Code Name: Tiger (1964), Special Mission Lady Chaplin (1966), and two 007 parodies: Balearic Caper (1966), and the previously mentioned O.K. Connery (1967). Sergio Sollima, who directed Requiem for a Secret Agent, also helmed two Bond-like films starring George Ardisson, Agent 3S3: Passport to Hell (1965), and Agent 3S3, Massacre in the Sun (1966). Ardisson made a third Italian spy film, Operation Counter Spy (1965). Maril√π Tolo was in seven Italian/French-Italian productions: Espionage in Lisbon (1965), Balearic Caper (1966), Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die (1966), Perry Grant, agente di ferro, a.k.a. The Big Blackout (1966), To Skin a Spy (1966), Judoka-Secret Agent (1966), and Casse-t√™te chinois pour le judoka (1967). And Luciana Paluzzi from Thunderball (1965) also made the French-Italian OSS 117 ‚Äì Double Agent (1968). Canadian-American actor Lang Jeffries played a secret agent in Agente X 1-7 operazione Oceano (Italy, 1965), Z7 Operation Rembrandt (Germany‚ÄìItaly, 1966), Spies Strike Silently (Italy, 1966), The Beckett Affair (France-Italy, 1966), The Killer Lacks a Name (Spain‚ÄìItaly, 1966), and Mexican Slayride (Spain‚ÄìItaly, 1967). A post 1960s pair of films based on French author G√©rard de Villiers SAS series appeared in the 1980s, S.A.S. √† San Salvador (1982) starring Miles O'Keeffe as Malko and Eye of the Widow (1989) with Richard Young as Malko. =British films= Daliah Lavi, best known for her two American 007 spoofs The Silencers (1966) and Casino Royale (1967), was in Shots in Threequarter Time a.k.a. Spy Hunt in Vienna and Operation Solo (Germany, 1965) and British films The Spy with a Cold Nose (1966) and Some Girls Do (1969), starring Richard Johnson. He starred in Danger Route (1967) and Deadlier Than the Male (1967), the latter with Sylva Koscina. She made two other British films, Hot Enough for June, a.k.a. Agent (1964), that featured a mention of Agent 007 and Our Man in Marrakesh a.k.a. Bang! Bang! You're Dead! (1966) and two Italian productions, That Man in Istanbul (1965) and Agent X-77 Orders to Kill (1966). Other British-made films include Master Spy (1964), The Quiller Memorandum (1966) starring George Segal, and Subterfuge (1968) starring Gene Barry. Michael Caine played the spy Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File (1965), and four sequels. The semi-parody Licensed to Kill a.k.a. The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World (1965), directed by Lindsay Shonteff, featured Bond- like agent Charles Vine. This was followed by two sequels: Where the Bullets Fly (1966), directed by John Gilling, and an obscure Spanish production O.K. Yevtushenko a.k.a. Somebody's Stolen Our Russian Spy (1968). Shonteff went on to direct three more films with a similar spy named \\"Charles Bind\\": Number One of the Secret Service (1970), Licensed to Love and Kill a.k.a. The Man from S.E.X. (1979), and Number One Gun (1990). =American films= Arabesque, Our Man Flint, The Silencers, Murderers' Row (all 1966), The Ambushers, In Like Flint (both 1967), A Man Called Dagger (1968), and The Wrecking Crew (1969). =Post-sixties parodies= Two French films starring Jean Dujardin, 2006's OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies (set in 1955) and 2009's OSS 117: Lost in Rio (set in 1967) both recreate the style of the period and parody the spy genre for a new audience. The American Austin Powers series (1997‚Äì2002) of three comedies starring Mike Myers are set in the 1960s and 1970s. The trio parodies James Bond and other Eurospy films. Michael Caine, as a character similar to his Harry Palmer role (The Ipcress File, et al.), plays Powers' father in the third film, Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). The Spanish film Anacleto: agente secreto/Spy Time (2015) reimagines the 1964 comic hero for the screen.

He travelled extensively in Gujarat, Rajputana and Punjab; and organised and reformed Jain community, ascetic orders and literature. He wrote several books in Hindi and was invited to the first World Parliament of Religions in 1893 which was attended by Virchand Gandhi later. Early life Vijayanandsuri Vijayanandsuri with his disciples in Ajmer in VS 1946 He was born on 6 April 1837 CE (Chaitra Shukla 1 Vikram Samvat 1893) in Lehara, Punjab to Ganeshchandra and Rupdevi. He was born in a Brahmakshatriya Hindu family.

His father died in his early childhood and he was raised by his mother. He was given to Sheth Jodhmal of Jira, Punjab for education in VS 1903. He studied Hindi and arithmetic. He came into contact with Sthanakvasi monks during his school life. A couple of influential Sthanakavasi monks initiated him in 1853 (VS 1910) at the age of sixteen and was given the name of Atmaram. Alt URL Ascetic career Memorial shrine in Gujranwala. From Chicago Prashnottar, 1918 Atmaram began the study of Jain scriptures along with his fellow ascetics. He was later joined by a Yati of Tapa Gaccha lineage. After several years of study, he was convinced that the Sthanakavasi position of opposition of Idol-worshiping contradicted the scriptures. Later in 1876 (VS 1943), he was initiated again as a Murtipujaka monk in Ahmedabad by Muni Buddhivijay, also known as Buterayji of Tapa Gaccha who himself was Sthanakvasi monk before. He was given a new name, Anandvijay. In 1886, he was conferred the title of Acharya by the congregation of Palitana during his Chaturmas (four months stay during rainy season) there. This was a notable event because since four centuries, there wasn't an ascetic who was conferred with the title of Acharya. He was the first Acharya of contemporary Jain history as till then only Yatis were conferred with the title. As a result of reforms advocated by him, the influence of yatis declined, although the yatis still survive in some locations.The Penguin Handbook of the World's Living Religions Penguin reference library, Penguin UK, 2010 He travelled extensively in Gujarat and Punjab. He convinced to open Jain Bhandaras (libraries) with Jain literature kept closed for people since years and had texts copied and examined by scholars. He brought these literature to light and instilled sense of identity among Jains. In 1893, he was invited to participate in the first ever World Parliament of Religions at Chicago and since Jain monks do not travel overseas he sent Virchand Gandhi to United States to participate in the World Parliament of Religions. He won silver medal in 1893 at Chicago and was covered by many USA periodicals.Jainism: The World of Conquerors By Natubhai Shah, 1998 Sussex Academic Press Based on questions that he had received from the organizers of the Parliament, he wrote a book for the occasion entitled The Chicago-Prashnottar or Questions and Answers on Jainism for the Parliament of Religions Held at Chicago USA in 1893. He was instrumental in reviving the tradition of fully initiated monks (Samvegi sadhu). He also convinced many Sthankvasis in the Punjab to join the Murtipujaka tradition. About 15000 people converted to Jainism due to his efforts. He also encouraged the construction and renovation of Jain temples. He had helped orientalist Rudolf Hoernl√© in his studies on Jainism. He died in Gujranwala (now in Pakistan) on 20 May 1896 (Jayeshtha Shukla 8 VS 1953). A memorial shrine dedicated to him was built there by Lala Mayadas Nanakchand Bhabras. His footprints along with the chhatri (cenotaph) over them, are moved to Lahore Fort Museum. Some artefacts and decorations were also moved.Foot prints of Atmaram ji The shrine was mistakenly identified as the memorial of Punjab ruler Ranjit Singh's grandfather Charat Singh. The shrine came under the local police in 1984 and used as a police station until 2003 when most offices were moved to new place. The central chamber was used as a office of the Gujranwala Deputy Police Superintendent. The building was used by traffic police until 2015. In 2019, it was declared as a protected monument by the Government of Punjab, Pakistan. Works He wrote a number of books in Hindi, including The Chicago-Prashnottar or Questions and Answers on Jainism for the Parliament of Religions Held at Chicago USA in 1893 which was translated into English and published in 1918. His other important works are Jain Tattvadarsh, Agyana Timira Bhaskara, Samyaktva-shalyadwara and Tattva Nirnaya PrƒÅsƒÅd. Legacy He used to give more importance to education and established several libraries and Pathshala (religious schools) in Punjab. Later Vallabhsuri, his disciple, built many schools, hospitals and educational institutes. He was given the title of Navyug Nirmata (builder of a new era) by Vallabhsuri. His monkhood lineage has large number of ascetics which roughly covers of all current ascetics of Tapa Gaccha. Major ascetic groupings are Atma-Vallabh Samuday, Prem-Ramchandra Suri and Prem-Bhuvanbhanu Suri Samuday.

Design and development The Joan-Eleanor system was developed from late 1942 onwards for the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) by DeWitt R. Goddard and Lt. Cmdr. Stephen H. Simpson, with some contributions from mobile radio pioneer Alfred J. Gross. It was reportedly named for Goddard's wife's Eleanor, and a WAC Major of Simpson's acquaintance named Joan. The initial design work was performed at RCA's laboratories in Riverhead, NY, and the production units produced by Citizens Radio of Cleveland, Freed Radio Corporation of NYC, Dictagraph Corporation of New York, and the Signal-U Manufacturing Company. Most of the testing was carried out in the United States and some at Bovington, England, beginning in July 1944, to refine the equipment with the first operational use later that same year. The system was classified as top secret by the US military and was not declassified until 1976. Description The system comprised a pair of transceivers: * A handheld SSTC-502 transceiver (\\"Joan\\") for use by an agent in the field. * An SSTR-6 transceiver (\\"Eleanor\\") carried on an aircraft flying overhead at a prearranged time. The system was designed to use the VHF band, since it was known that these frequencies could not be effectively monitored by the enemy. The agent made his report in plain speech, and the aircraft recorded the transmission on a wire recorder. Since Morse code was not required, the agent did not need to be trained in it, thus reducing overall training time, which was considered an advantage in the European theater. Additionally, the aircraft could ask for immediate clarification if required, without the delay of encryption and decryption, or an intelligence officer aboard the circling aircraft could talk directly with the agent. Because of the low power and the unit's limited range, the transmissions were virtually undetectable and the Germans were unaware of the system. =SSTC-502 transceiver= Unlike large conventional radios that weighed up to 30 pounds, the hand-held SSTC-502 transceiver was only 6.5\\" long and weighed less than one pound. It used a dual triode as a combination super- regenerative detector while receiving, and an oscillator during transmission. Two other vacuum tubes acted as a microphone amplifier and modulator. The antenna was a simple dipole attached to the top of the unit and the only controls were for regeneration and fine tuning. The unit was powered by two D cells for the tube filaments, and two 67.5 V batteries for the tubes' plates. The original operating frequency was 250 MHz, but it was discovered that the Germans had a receiver capable of operating at this frequency, and it was changed to 260 MHz. =SSTR-6 transceiver= The airborne SSTR-6 transceiver weighed about 40 pounds. It had a superheterodyne receiver with two RF amplifier stages, two limiter stages, and an FM detector. Power was supplied by four 6V wet cell batteries. The equipment was used in B-17 and de Havilland Mosquito aircraft, the Mosquito being used for most missions due to its high speed and high altitude capability which rendered it safe from most defenses. Operational The initial aircraft used with the J-E system were de Havilland Mosquito PR (Photoreconnaissance) Mk. XVI aircraft of the 654th Bombardment Squadron, 25th Bomb Group Rcn at Watton, UK. Since 25th Bomb Group personnel flew Joan-Eleanor missions for OSS, Watton wished credit for these in monthly operational tabulations. They assigned the label Redstocking to the missions. For J-E missions the rear-fuselage compartment, aft of the bomb-bay, was fitted with an oxygen system and modified to accept the SSTR-6 transceiver and wire recorder, with an operator sitting on a cramped seat, and accessed through a side hatch. The first successful operational use of the system was made on 22 November 1944 by Stephen H. Simpson; he recorded transmissions from an agent codenamed \\"Bobbie\\" while orbiting at 30,000 ft over the occupied Netherlands. Another occurred on 12/13 March 1945 when a Mosquito PR XVI at 25,500 ft near Berlin established radio contact with agents who had earlier been dropped on 1/2 March from an A-26 Invader. On 13 March 1945, HQ 8th AF ordered the OSS JE Project transferred to the 492nd Bomb Group's Liberator base at Harrington, Northamptonshire. The 492nd continued using Redstocking to identify the Mosquito missions. On 14 March two Mosquitoes and an A-26 flew to Harrington followed on the 15th by other Mosquitoes and A-26s. The 25th BG aircrew flew the OSS Mosquito JE missions until 492nd men completed training on this aircraft type. Both Mosquito and A-26 remained stationed at Harrington, and on occasion a Mosquito flew to Watton for inspection. OSS JE project personnel at Harrington questioned the competency of 492nd BG maintaining the Mosquito and JE operations and frequently consulted Watton. Aborts excluded, the 654th Bombardment Squadron flew 30 Joan-Eleanor (JE) Mosquito missions from Watton on behalf of the OSS over the Netherlands and Germany, and an additional 21 JE Mosquito missions from Harrington. 492nd flew 10 JE Mosquito missions.

Bhd. (UMWT) is the appointed Toyota distributor, assembler and exporter of Toyota vehicles in Malaysia. The company was founded in October 1982 as Sejati Motor, prior to being renamed UMW Toyota Motor in October 1987. UMW Toyota Motor is a 51:39:10 joint venture between Malaysia- based United Motor Works (UMW), and the Toyota Motor Corporation and Toyota Tsusho Corporation of Japan. UMWT wholly owns Assembly Services Sdn. Bhd. (ASSB), the exclusive assembler of Toyota passenger and commercial vehicles in Malaysia. UMW Toyota Motor has also been the official distributor of Lexus vehicles in Malaysia since 2006. History=1960s= Toyota vehicles were first imported into Malaysia in August 1956, with the first unit being a Land Cruiser. Toyota signed distributor agreements with various Malaysian partners prior to UMW Toyota Motor, namely Asia Motor (1956‚Äì1960), Kah Motor (September 1960‚ÄìFebruary 1974), Borneo Motors (September 1967‚ÄìSeptember 1982), Sarin Motor (January 1979‚ÄìFebruary 1983) and Emastorin Motor (September 1979‚ÄìApril 1984). Additionally, two Malaysian plants were appointed as assemblers of Toyota's complete knock down (CKD) kits, namely Champion Motors / Assembly Services and Sarawak Motor Industries. Prior to 1968, Malaysian market Toyota models were only imported as complete built up (CBU) units. In the 1960s, the Malaysian government began to emphasise industrialisation, then viewed as a more dependable economic sector for employment and economic growth. In May 1964, the Malaysian government enacted a policy to encourage the local assembly of vehicles and manufacturing of automotive components, as per the recommendation of experts from the Colombo Plan. The new policy made complete built up (CBU) cars more expensive through the addition of import duties, and licenses were issued to various car companies who were interested in setting up local assembly plants. Cars that were locally assembled with Malaysian manufactured components, then limited to low-value parts like tyres, lights and batteries would be granted a reduction in import duty, making them cheaper and more competitive as a result. =1970s= In the 1970s, Malaysia experienced an economic boom as a result of increased industrialisation. Japanese companies heavily invested in Malaysia during this period, and Toyota was one of several Japanese firms which contributed to the development of Malaysia's automotive industry. Local assembly of the Toyota Corolla (E10) and Toyota Corona (T40) commenced in February 1968 at the Champion Motors (CM) plant in Shah Alam. Toyota exported complete knock down (CKD) kits from Japan to Malaysia, where they were assembled by Champion Motors. However, Toyota had no equity stake in Champion Motors, which was established by Motor Investments (MIB), a subsidiary of London-based Inchcape. In addition to Toyota models, Champion Motors had also assembled Chevrolet, Mercedes-Benz, Vauxhall and Volkswagen models. Champion Motors was renamed Assembly Services Sdn. Bhd. (ASSB) in April 1975. Over the course of the 1970s, Assembly Services benefited from significant technology transfer from Toyota. Production engineers from Toyota contributed to the design of ASSB's plant and advised on the assembly of vehicles. The Malaysian public, traditionally accustomed to European cars up until the 1960s were initially sceptical of the new Japanese cars. However, by the mid-1970s, the Toyota Corolla had grown rapidly in popularity to become a best-seller in the Malaysian market, second only to the Datsun 120Y. The success of the Corolla was largely attributed to its admirable reliability, fuel efficiency and value for money appeal, elements which many of its European counterparts could not match. The partnership between ASSB and Toyota strengthened over the course of the 1970s, and Toyota vehicles regularly accounted for the bulk of ASSB's production volume. =1980s‚Äìpresent= The Toyota Vios is UMW Toyota's best selling model. In March 1980, Toyota set up a representative office in Kuala Lumpur, and in October 1982, Sejati Motor was established through a joint venture between the Toyota Motor Corporation and United Motor Works (UMW). Sejati Motor acquired the Assembly Services plant and Borneo Motors network from Inchcape, and in October 1987, Sejati Motor was renamed UMW Toyota Motor (UMWT). ASSB remained a subsidiary of UMWT ever since, as the exclusive assembler of Toyota vehicles in Malaysia. However, UMWT's plans for expansion in the Malaysian market were drafted just prior to the advent of Proton and the mid-1980s economic crisis, both of which had severe implications on UMWT's business model. Nonetheless, UMWT adapted to the market changes by pushing the Toyota brand upmarket, with an emphasis on aftersales and customer satisfaction. Toyota eventually surpassed arch-rival Nissan to become the best-selling foreign-badged car company in the Malaysian market, a title which UMWT held for over 20 years. However, in 2014, UMWT lost their coveted title to Honda Malaysia. In 2006, UMW Toyota Motor was awarded the franchise rights to distribute Lexus vehicles in Malaysia. Cumulative Toyota vehicle production in Malaysia reached 1 million units in 2011. As of late 2017, UMW Toyota officially distributes a total of twelve Toyota models, six of which are assembled by ASSB, while all Lexus models are fully imported. Another manufacturing plant at Bukit Raja, Klang rolled out its first car on 10 January 2019 which was a Toyota Vios. This plant will operate alongside the existing plant at Shah Alam and during its initial face can have an annual output of 50,000 vehicles.

For example, typical judgments in first- order logic would be that a string is a well-formed formula, or that a proposition is true. Similarly, a judgment may assert the occurrence of a free variable in an expression of the object language, or the provability of a proposition. In general, a judgment may be any inductively definable assertion in the metatheory. Judgments are used in formalizing deduction systems: a logical axiom expresses a judgment, premises of a rule of inference are formed as a sequence of judgments, and their conclusion is a judgment as well (thus, hypotheses and conclusions of proofs are judgments). A characteristic feature of the variants of Hilbert-style deduction systems is that the context is not changed in any of their rules of inference, while both natural deduction and sequent calculus contain some context-changing rules. Thus, if we are interested only in the derivability of tautologies, not hypothetical judgments, then we can formalize the Hilbert-style deduction system in such a way that its rules of inference contain only judgments of a rather simple form. The same cannot be done with the other two deductions systems: as context is changed in some of their rules of inferences, they cannot be formalized so that hypothetical judgments could be avoided‚Äînot even if we want to use them just for proving derivability of tautologies. This basic diversity among the various calculi allows such difference, that the same basic thought (e.g. deduction theorem) must be proven as a metatheorem in Hilbert-style deduction system, while it can be declared explicitly as a rule of inference in natural deduction. In type theory, some analogous notions are used as in mathematical logic (giving rise to connections between the two fields, e.g. Curry‚ÄìHoward correspondence). The abstraction in the notion of judgment in mathematical logic can be exploited also in foundation of type theory as well.

Created in 1972, the medallion is presented to individuals, both Canadians and foreigners, living and deceased, who have performed acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril and grants recipients the ability to use the post-nominal letters CV. History The Cross of Valour was conceived of as a replacement for the Order of Canada's Medal of Courage, which had never been awarded since its creation in 1967. On the advice of her Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the Cross of Valour was initiated on 1 May 1972 by Queen Elizabeth II, and presented for the first time on 20 July of the same year. Prior to 1967, the equivalent medal that Canadians received was the George Cross, of which ten were awarded in Canada: eight military, one merchant navy, and one civilian. The Cross of Valour became the centre of a controversy in 2007, when it was announced from the Chancellery of Honours at the Governor General of Canada's residence, Rideau Hall, that deceased Cobourg, Ontario, police constable Chris Garrett would not be awarded the honour. Garett died on duty after an individual lured him with a false 9-1-1 call and then cut his throat; however, Garett, as he was dying, shot and disabled the assailant, thereby preventing other planned attacks. But, because Garett's nominator waited until the trial for the constable's murderer was concluded, the application arrived at Rideau Hall eight months past the stipulated two-year deadline. After a public outcry, the Governor General-in-Council adjusted the rules of application for the Cross of Valour. Garrett was granted the Star of Courage. Design The medal is a cross of four equal limbs rendered in gold, with the obverse enamelled in red and edged with gold, and bearing at the centre a gold maple leaf surrounded by a gold laurel wreath. On the reverse is the Royal Cypher of the reigning Canadian sovereign and a crown above, on the upper arm, while the words VALOUR ‚Ä¢ VAILLANCE are etched below, extending along the upper edge of the two lateral arms of the cross. The recipient's name and the date of the incident for which they are being honoured are engraved underneath the motto. This medallion is worn by men, suspended from a red ribbon around the neck; and by women, below the left shoulder suspended from a red ribbon fashioned into a bow;https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/canadian- honours/decorations-bravery/regulations a miniature cross may be worn on the ribbon bar in undress. Should an individual already possessing a Cross of Valour be awarded the medal again for subsequent valourous acts, he or she is granted a gold maple leaf to be carried on the same ring from which the original cross is hung; no bars have been issued to date. Eligibility Anyone may nominate or be nominated for receipt of the Cross of Valour; the incident need not take place in Canada, but Canadian people and/or interests must be involved. The decoration may be awarded posthumously, though nominations must be made no later than two years following either the act of bravery itself or the conclusion of any coroner's or court's inquest into the events for which the person was nominated.

The school also ran (evening) workshops seasonally throughout the year, which began in January, March, June and September. The workshops were offered in a variety of disciplines for all skill levels. History NESOP was founded in 1968 by Academy-Award nominated cinematographer John H. Carruthers to fill the need for professional photographic training in the Boston area. The school was originally located at 739 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts. The first students began class in September 1969 and graduated in May 1971. In August 1972, NESOP was moved to its present location at 537 Commonwealth Avenue, Kenmore Square, Boston, Massachusetts and grown to occupy approximately , including space at 650 Beacon Street, Kenmore Square, Boston, Massachusetts. NESOP started with general photographic curriculum in 1968 and responding to the needs of the marketplace now offers eight Majors in commercial and artistic areas as well as ten Minor areas of study. In August 1991, William R. Carruthers took as President of NESOP and in December 2006 he assumed ownership due to his father's (John H. Carruthers) passing.

Many conspiracy theories have been advanced, but none have been found to be completely persuasive by experts, and some are not taken seriously at all. The murder investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department was the largest since the murder of Marion Parker in 1927, and involved hundreds of officers borrowed from other law enforcement agencies. Sensational and sometimes inaccurate press coverage, as well as the nature of the crime, focused intense public attention on the case. As the case continues to command public attention, many more people have been proposed as Short's killer, much like London's Jack the Ripper murders. Original suspects Because of the complexity of the case, the original investigators treated every person who knew Elizabeth Short as a suspect who had to be eliminated. Hundreds of people were considered suspects and thousands were interviewed by police. About 60 people confessed to the murder, mostly men but including a few women. However, 24 people were considered to be viable suspects by the Los Angeles County District Attorney:Lemons, Stephen. \\"Black Dahlia Backlash: Family members take Hodel‚Äôs Avenger to task, LA Weekly, July 10, 2003.

Recent suspects While some of the original 24 suspects were discounted, new ones have arisen. At present the following suspects are discussed by various authors and experts: =Walter Bayley= Bayley was a Los Angeles surgeon who lived one block south of the vacant lot in which Short's body was found, until he left his wife in October 1946. His daughter was a friend of Short's sister Virginia, and had been the matron of honor at her wedding. When Bayley died in January 1948, his autopsy showed that he was suffering from a degenerative brain disease. After his death, his widow alleged that his mistress knew a \\"terrible secret\\" about Bayley and was made the main beneficiary upon his death as a result. Bayley was never a suspect in the case, but many medical doctors and others with medical training were. In secret testimony, Detective Harry Hansen, one of the original investigators, told the 1949 Los Angeles County grand jury that in his opinion the killer was a \\"top medical man\\" and \\"a fine surgeon.\\" Bayley was 67 years old at the time of the murder, had no known history of violence or criminal activity of any kind, and is not known to have met Short, even though his daughter was a friend of Short's oldest sister. When Larry Harnisch, a Los Angeles Times copy editor and writer, began studying the case in 1996, he eventually concluded that Bayley could be Short's killer. Although critics of Harnisch's theory question whether Bayley's mental and physical condition at the time of the murder would have been consistent with the commission of this type of crime, the original investigators' theory that the body was cut in half because the killer wasn't strong enough to move it intact partially answers this objection. Harnisch theorizes that Bayley's neurological deterioration contributed to his alleged violence against Short. Some have suggested that the secret Bayley's mistress was blackmailing him with was that he had performed abortions, then a crime. However, there is no evidence that either Bayley or his associates performed abortions. Author James Ellroy endorsed Harnisch's theory in the 2001 film James Ellroy's Feast of Death. Among Harnisch's behavioral/psychological evidence: Bayley's neurodegenerative condition was known to produce violent behavior in otherwise passive individuals; his surgical specializations included mastectomies, hysterectomies, and the surgical removal of fat; in conversation with Bayley's former receptionist, Harnisch discovered that he and his mistress would, at dinnertime, watch movies of surgeries and autopsies. In devising his theory, Harnisch consulted retired FBI profiler John E. Douglas, who advised that the very public location of the dump site was significant, since the killer had the ability to transport the body to a more remote site, where it may not have been discovered; the site was one block away from property owned by Bayley's estranged wife Ruth. Douglas also advised that the facial lacerations indicated personal anger towards the victim: Short would often falsely tell men that she had a son who had died tragically; Bayley did, in fact, have a son who was struck by a car and killed at age 11. The deceased child's birthday was January 13; Short's body was discovered on January 15. =Norman Chandler= Donald Wolfe's 2005 book The Black Dahlia Files: The Mob, the Mogul, and the Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles names Norman Chandler, publisher of the Los Angeles Times from 1945-1960, as a suspect in the murder. In a complicated scenario involving multiple perpetrators, Wolfe claims that Chandler impregnated Short while she was working as a call girl for the notorious Hollywood \\"madam\\" Brenda Allen, which led to her murder at the hands of gangster Bugsy Siegel. Wolfe's claim that Short was a prostitute is at odds with the Los Angeles County district attorney's files, which plainly state that she was not, as Wolfe asserts, pregnant.Black Dahlia - News 2 =Leslie Dillon= Dillon was a 27-year-old bellhop, aspiring writer, and former mortician's assistant who became a suspect when he began writing to Los Angeles Police Department psychiatrist Dr. J. Paul De River in October 1948. Dillon was living in Florida at the time of his correspondence with De River, but had formerly lived in Los Angeles. He read a story about the case in a True Detective-style magazine in which De River was quoted, and wrote to De River regarding his theories on the case. In his correspondence, he mentioned an intense interest in sadism and sexual violence in hopes of authoring a book on the subject. Dillon offered up one of his friends, Jeff Connors, as a likely suspect. Over the course of their correspondence, De River began to believe that Connors did not exist and that Dillon had committed the murder himself. In December 1948, Dillon agreed to meet with De River and was given the choice of one of three cities: Los Angeles; Phoenix, Arizona; or Las Vegas, Nevada. Dillon expressed reservations about Los Angeles, and chose Las Vegas instead. De River and undercover LAPD officers met Dillon in Las Vegas for a couple of days and then proceeded to drive back to California. Once there, Dillon and De River traveled to San Francisco to unsuccessfully look for Connors. When Dillon offered up intimate details about the crime, he was taken into custody by the undercover officers and transported to Los Angeles. After this happened, Dillon sailed a postcard out a hotel window with a plea for help on it; it was discovered by a passerby and turned in to local authorities. Police soon discovered that Connors did indeed exist; his real name was Artie Lane. Lane had lived in Los Angeles at the time of the murder and was employed by Columbia Studios, a favorite hangout of Short's, as a maintenance man. However, contrary to popular belief, Dillon could not be conclusively placed in San Francisco at the time of the murder. In fact, police never could account for Dillon's whereabouts between January 9 and January 15, 1947. Dillon later filed a $100,000 claim against the City of Los Angeles, but dropped the lawsuit after it emerged he was wanted by Santa Monica police for robbery. Los Angeles Times reporter Larry Harnisch disputes this and says that Dillon did in fact receive a financial settlement from the City of Los Angeles. The incident led to a 1949 grand jury investigation of police handling of the Black Dahlia case and some other unsolved murders.Black Dahlia - News 2 The publication of the Long Beach Police The Rap Sheet said that a former member of LA's Gangster Squad investigating the case believed that Leslie Dillon was the killer and when Dillon returned to his home state of Oklahoma was able to avoid extradition to California because Dillon's relative was the governor of Oklahoma. Some speculated that Dillon's ex-wife Georgie Stevenson was related to former Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, who contacted the Oklahoma governor on Dillon's behalf, although none of these relations have been verified. In 2004, De River's daughter, Jacque Daniel, published a book called The Curse of the Black Dahlia, in which she expressed her belief that her father had been unfairly maligned for the Dillon affair. =Joseph A. Dumais= Dumais, a 29-year-old soldier stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey, confessed to Short's murder a few weeks after it occurred. Although this \\"breakthrough\\" was quickly dismissed by the original investigators, the Los Angeles press covered it enthusiastically until it was revealed that Dumais had been at Fort Dix at the time of the murder. Dumais was cleared of any involvement in the crime, although he continued to claim he killed Short each time he was arrested for various offenses, well into the 1950s. =Mark Hansen= Hansen was a Hollywood nightclub owner at whose home Short lived, either as a paying boarder or as a guest, on several occasions between May 1946 and October 1946. Hansen's girlfriend Ann Toth shared a room with Short in this house, which was near Hansen's nightclub. Short called Hansen from San Diego on January 8, making him one of the last people known to have spoken to her.Black Dahlia - News The Los Angeles County District Attorney's files indicate that Hansen made contradictory statements to authorities about the nature of this conversation. An address book embossed with Hansen's name was among Short's belongings mailed to the Los Angeles Examiner after her murder by someone claiming to be the killer. The address book belonged to Hansen, but he had never used it; Short had been using it as her own. The D.A.'s files also indicate that Hansen had tried to seduce Short but was rebuffed. He was one of the first serious suspects in the case and he was still a prime suspect as late as 1951. Hansen was also linked to three other suspects, each of whom was a medical doctor: Dr. Patrick S. O'Reilly, Dr. M. M. Schwartz, and Dr. Arthur McGinnis Faught.Black Dahlia - News 2 Buz Williams, a retired detective with the Long Beach Police Department, wrote an article for the LBPD newsletter The Rap Sheet in 2000 on Elizabeth Short's murder. Williams' father Richard F. Williams and his friend Con Keller were both members of LA's Gangster Squad investigating the case. Keller believed Mark Hansen was the killer and said Hansen was Swedish and had spent some time at Sweden's Medical Surgical School (Hansen was actually born in Denmark) which would explain the precise dissection of Short's body. Keller also said that Hansen held elaborate parties at his Hollywood boarding house and members of the Los Angeles Police Department along with the Chief of Detectives Thad Brown and his brother Finis Brown attended and later aided Hansen in a cover up. Williams mentioned that Hansen owned a Ford Lincoln-Mercury car lot on Hollywood Boulevard and his LAPD friends were later coincidentally driving around town in brand new Lincoln cars. Hansen died of natural causes in 1964. No charges were ever brought against him. He had no criminal record and no known history of violence. LAPD Police Chief William Worton told the Los Angeles Examiner that there was absolutely no case against Hansen. Hansen's great granddaughter Helen Alexis Yonov was interviewed for Piu Eatwell's upcoming documentary on the Black Dahlia for NBC Peacock Productions. Popular accounts of the Black Dahlia case often portray Hansen as having connections to organized crime, but there is no evidence of this. =George Hodel= Dr. George Hill Hodel, Jr. came under police scrutiny in October 1949, when his 14-year-old daughter, Tamar, accused him of molesting her. Despite three witnesses testifying that they had seen Hodel having sex with Tamar, he was acquitted in December 1949.Nelson, Mark; Sarah Hudson Bayliss (2006). Exquisite Corpse: Surrealism and the Black Dahlia Murder. New York: Bulfinch Press. Pg 26. The trial led the LAPD to include Hodel, a physician specializing in sexually transmitted diseases, among its many suspects in the Dahlia case. Police put Hodel under surveillance from February 18 to March 27, 1950, to ascertain whether he could be implicated in the murder. In the surviving transcripts of microphone recordings, Hodel was heard making highly incriminating statements. The secretary referred to was Ruth Spaulding, who police had previously suspected of being murdered by Hodel in 1945. He was present when Spaulding overdosed and had burnt some of her papers before police were called. The case was dropped owing to lack of evidence, but documents were later found that indicated Spaulding was about to publicly accuse Hodel of intentionally misdiagnosing patients and billing them for laboratory tests, medical treatment, and prescriptions not needed. Hodel's son, former LAPD homicide detective Steve Hodel, believes Short may have been one of his father's patients. In the final report to the grand jury, dated February 20, 1951, Lt. Frank Jemison of the Los Angeles County D.A.'s office wrote: > Doctor George Hodel, M.D. 5121 Fountain [Franklin] Avenue, at the time of > this murder had a clinic at East First Street near Alameda.

See supplemental reports, long sheets and > hear recordings, all of which tend to eliminate this suspect. The report, from which the above excerpt was taken, was submitted at the completion of the D.A.'s investigation of Hodel and at least 21 other suspects. In 2003, Steve Hodel published a book, Black Dahlia Avenger; A Genius for Murder, in which he claimed his father, who died in 1999, had murdered Short and was responsible for other unsolved killings over two decades. Steve had seen two pictures in his father's photo album that he claims resemble Short, although her family insists they are not of her and many other observers have failed to see the resemblance. Since beginning his investigation, Steve located and identified one of the photographic subjects as a former friend of George Hodel. The other photograph remains unidentified. Steve claims he was unaware at the time that his father had been a suspect, although his sister Tamar was friends with Janice Knowlton, author of her own book, Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer, and case documents make it clear that Steve's parents and many of their associates knew George Hodel was a suspect. After reviewing the information presented in Steve's book, Head Deputy D.A. Stephen Kay proclaimed the case solved, but others have noted that he had formed this conclusion by treating Steve's many disputed assertions as established fact. Detective Brian Carr, the LAPD officer in charge of the Black Dahlia case at the time of Steve's briefing, said in a televised interview that he was baffled by Kay's response. In a September 2006 television interview, Carr added, \\"I don't have the time to either prove or disprove Hodel's investigation. I am too busy working on active cases.\\" In 2009, Hodel published Most Evil: Avenger, Zodiac, and the Further Serial Murders of Dr. George Hill Hodel, in which he claimed that his father was also the Zodiac Killer. Author James Ellroy endorsed Steve Hodel's theory in 2004, but has since refused to discuss the case publicly. Steve Hodel maintains a website wherein he continues to update the case with additional discovered information. =George Knowlton= Little reliable information is available on George Knowlton, except that he lived in the Los Angeles area at the time of the Black Dahlia murder and died in an automobile accident in 1962. In the early 1990s, George Knowlton's daughter Janice began claiming that she had witnessed her father murdering Elizabeth Short, a claim she based largely on \\"recovered memories\\" that surfaced during therapy for depression after a hysterectomy. Based on these recovered memories, Knowlton published Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer with veteran crime writer Michael Newton in 1995. In the book, Knowlton, a former professional singer and owner of a public relations company, alleged that her father had been having an affair with Elizabeth Short and that Short was staying in a makeshift bedroom in their garage, where she suffered a miscarriage.Note that Short's autopsy by Dr. Frederick Newbarr found no evidence of pregnancy: \\"The uterus is small, and no pregnancy is apparent.\\" As quoted in Newton, 2009, p. 46 George Knowlton allegedly murdered Short in the garage and bisected her in the sink, then forced his then ten-year-old daughter Janice to accompany him when he disposed of the body. According to Knowlton, Short was a sex worker and a procurer of children for a child trafficking ring. Knowlton claimed that a former member of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department told her that her father was considered a suspect in the case by that agency, but this claim is unsupported by the public documents that have been released in the case. She claimed the same source told her that future LAPD chief and California politician Ed Davis and Los Angeles County District Attorney Buron Fitts were suspects in the murder as well. The Los Angeles Times wrote in 1991: > Los Angeles Police Detective John P. St. John, one of the investigators who > had been assigned to the case, said he has talked to Knowlton and does not > believe there is a connection between the Black Dahlia murder and her > father. \\"We have a lot of people offering up their fathers and various > relatives as the Black Dahlia killer,\\" said St. John, better known as Jigsaw > John. \\"The things that she is saying are not consistent with the facts of > the case. Nevertheless, Westminster, California police took her claims seriously enough to dig up the grounds around her childhood home there, looking for evidence. They found nothing to tie George Knowlton to any crime. In a side note to her accusations against her father, Janice Knowlton, who was a frequent contributor as to various online forums wherein the Black Dahlia case was discussed, posted an articlehttps://groups.google.com/group/alt.news- media/msg/520d0ca8b1f82d31?hl=en to a Usenet group in August 1998 in which she names Dr. George Hodel (see above) as a suspect in the case. Knowlton's sister has since stated on Amazon.com's listing for Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer that after the publication of Knowlton's book, Tamar Hodel, daughter of George Hodel and sister of Steve Hodel, contacted Knowlton and the two women remained \\"email pals for several years.\\" Knowlton also made claims prefiguring those of Black Dahlia Files author Donald Wolfe. In 1999, she claimed in various public forums that Norman Chandler participated in a coverup of the murder. Knowlton claimed that on Halloween 1946, she was sold at the age of nine as a child prostitute to a Pasadena satanic sex cult.Knowlton, Janice, with Michael Newton (1995). Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer. New York: Pocket Books. Pg 128. She frequently alleged that she was sexually abused by a long list of dead movie stars and other notables, including Norman Chandler, Gene Autry (whose name she continually misspelled as Autrey), Arthur Freed, and Walt Disney. Knowlton became somewhat infamous within online Black Dahlia discussion communities for her insistence that the LAPD was engaged in a conspiracy to discredit her story in order to conceal their knowledge of George Knowlton's involvement. She was so abusive in her Usenet postshttps://groups.google.com/group/alt.true- crime/browse_thread/thread/8697985d89f9cf0d/6597d7598ac16723?lnk=st&q;=jgk61+pacbell&rnum;=2#6597d7598ac16723Usenet that Pacific Bell canceled her account in 1999. On March 5, 2004, Janice Knowlton died of an overdose of prescription drugs in what was deemed a suicide by the Orange County, California, coroner's office. In 2009,Newton, Michael (2009) The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes, second edition. NY, Checkmark Books, Newton wrote that Janice Knowlton's relatives confirmed her father George was capable of violent abuse and further reported of his \\"boasts of [having committed] unprosecuted homicides\\". However, Newton also admitted that Janice's allegations against her father were entirely circumstantial and lacked substantial corroboration. =Robert M. \\"Red\\" Manley= The last person seen with Elizabeth Short before her disappearance, Manley was the LAPD's top suspect in the first few days after the killing. After two polygraph tests and a sworn alibi, Manley was set free. He also identified Short's handbag purse and one of her shoes after they were discovered in a trashcan on January 25, 1947, several miles from the murder scene.The Black Dahlia Murder, aka Elizabeth Short - The Crime library Manley, who had been discharged from the army for mental disability, subsequently suffered a series of nervous breakdowns and claimed to be hearing voices. As a result, he was committed to Patton State Hospital by his wife in 1954. He died on January 16, 1986. The coroner attributed his death to an accidental fall.Black Dahlia Murder Suspects - Beth Short Murder - The Crime library =Patrick S. O'Reilly= According to Los Angeles district attorney files, Dr. Patrick O'Reilly was a medical doctor who knew Short through nightclub owner Mark Hansen. According to the files, at the time of the murder O'Reilly was a good friend of Hansen and frequented Hansen's nightclub. Files also state that O'Reilly \\"attended sex parties at Malibu\\" with Hansen. O'Reilly had a history of sexually motivated violent crime. He had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for \\"taking his secretary to a motel and sadistically beating her almost to death apparently for no other reason than to satisfy his sexual desires without intercourse,\\" the files state. Further, the files indicate that O'Reilly's right pectoral had been surgically removed, which investigators found similar to the mutilation of Short's body. The files indicate that O'Reilly had once been married to the daughter of an LAPD captain. =Jack Anderson Wilson (a.k.a. Arnold Smith)= Wilson was a lifelong petty criminal and alcoholic who was interviewed by author John Gilmore while Gilmore was researching his book Severed. After Wilson's death, Gilmore named Wilson as a suspect owing to his alleged acquaintance with Short. Prior to Wilson's death, however, Gilmore made an entirely different claim to the Los Angeles Herald- Examiner in a story appearing January 17, 1982. While Severed says that homicide Detective John St. John was about to \\"close in\\" on Wilson based on the material Gilmore provided, St. John told the Herald-Examiner in the same article that he was busy with other killings and would review Gilmore's claims when he got time. As reliable sources of information about the case, such as the FBI files and portions of the Los Angeles district attorney files, have become publicly available, statements about Short and the murder attributed to Wilson in Severed and supposedly tying him to the crime have not been borne out as accurate. Severed also claims Wilson was involved in the murder of Georgette Bauerdorf. Severed and many other sources based on Severed erroneously claim that Short and Bauerdorf knew each other in Los Angeles, supposedly because they were both hostesses at the same nightclub. In reality, by the time Short arrived in Los Angeles in 1946, Bauerdorf had been dead for two years and the nightclub had been closed for a year. Wilson was never a suspect until Gilmore brought him to the attention of authorities. Wilson figures in Donald Wolfe's book The Mob, The Mogul, And The Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles. Wolfe hypothesizes that Wilson was present at Short's murder and claims a connection between Wilson and gangster Bugsy Siegel through some small-time gangsters Wilson supposedly associated with. He was also a member of the military. Female suspects Although the vast majority of suspects in the case were male, authorities did not rule out the possibility of a female killer. One theory held that, because Short had checked her baggage, including her clothing and cosmetics, a week before she died, she must have been staying with another woman (who presumably would have lent Short the essentials) during the intervening time. Another theory was that the assailant bisected Short's body because he or she was not strong enough to move it in one piece. One of the first people to confess to the murder was a WAC sergeant stationed in San Diego. Authorities took the confession seriously enough to investigate and found it groundless.Black Dahlia - News 2 Another suspect is referred to simply as \\"Queer Woman Surgeon\\" in the Los Angeles district attorney's files on the case. Newspaper stories at the time implied that Short was a lesbian or bisexual, but the district attorney files state bluntly that Short \\"had no use for queers.\\" Celebrity suspects=Woody Guthrie= Folk singer Woody Guthrie was one of the many suspects in the murder, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's files and Ramblin' Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie written by Ed Cray and published in 2004 by W.W. Norton. According to Cray, Guthrie drew police attention because of some sexually explicit letters and tabloid clippings he sent to a Northern California woman who he was allegedly stalking. The mailings disturbed the recipient so much that she showed them to her sister in Los Angeles, who contacted the police. Guthrie was quickly cleared of involvement in the murder, but various authorities attempted to prosecute him, with minor success, on charges related to sending prohibited materials through the mail. =Orson Welles= In her 2000 book, Mary Pacios, a former neighbor of the Short family in Medford, Massachusetts, suggested filmmaker Orson Welles as a suspect. Pacios bases this theory on such factors as Welles's volatile temperament and his creation of mannequins three months before Short's death that supposedly featured lacerations virtually identical to those inflicted on Short. The mannequins were used in the \\"house of mirrors\\" set for The Lady from Shanghai, a film Welles was making with his ex- wife Rita Hayworth around the time of the murder. The scenes containing the set were deleted from the film by Harry Cohn. In one of Short's last letters home, her older sister Virginia claimed she had written that a movie director was going to give her a screen test. Pacios also cites Welles' familiarity with the site where the body was found and the magic act he performed to entertain soldiers during World War II. She believes that the bisection of the body was part of the killer's signature and an acting out of the perpetrator's obsession. Welles applied for his passport on January 24, 1947, the same day the killer mailed a packet to Los Angeles newspapers. Welles left the country for an extended stay in Europe 10 months after the murder without completing the editing of Macbeth, the film he was both directing and starring in. Despite persistent attempts by Republic Pictures to get him to return to complete the film, he refused. According to Pacios, witnesses she had interviewed state that Welles and the victim both frequented Brittingham's restaurant in Los Angeles during the same time period and waitresses believed Short was going out with someone at Columbia Pictures. Welles was never a suspect in the investigation. = Bugsy Siegel = Los Angeles Jewish mobster Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel was allegedly a suspect in the murder investigation of Short. The reason why he was a suspect is unclear, especially since Siegel was more concerned with the Flamingo Hotel and Casino at the time and he was known to be a \\"lady's man\\" not a \\"lady's killer.\\" Also, Siegel was involved with Chicago Outfit starlet, and his on-off girlfriend Virginia Hill. Still, according to Don Wolfe's book The Black Dahlia Files: The Mob, the Mogul, and the Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles, Siegel was the actual murderer. It has also been surmised that if Siegel had any involvement with the Dahlia murder, he would have sent Mickey Cohen or one of his other henchmen. Yet another theory was that the murder may have been an attempt to frame Siegel by Jack Dragna, who wanted revenge for Siegel's attacks on Dragna's business interests since his arrival in the 1930s.

The character arrived to the soap as a mysterious love interest for Claire Solomon (Emily Robins), only to go through a storyline that saw Kieran discover he has a brain tumour, memory losses and is really a pimp from Thailand. His criminal past sends Kieran to the forefront of the show during a storyline which saw Claire and 4 other characters murdered by a psychopathic serial killer who later turned out to be Kieran's flat mate. Kieran's story arc's would often see him portrayed as an antagonist but the character also had numerous romances and light storylines, including two engagements to Libby Jeffries (Fleur Saville) and a short lived marriage to schoolgirl Sophie McKay (Kimberley Crossman). Becoming the owner of the hospital's local bar The I.V, Kieran found himself performing numerous criminal deeds, culminating in 2009 when he accidentally hit and killed good friend Morgan Braithwaite (Bonnie Soper) in his car. The character's criminal past finally caught up with him in 2010 and he was killed, falling off a cliff while fighting with an ex-enemy in the show's first ever 90-minute episode. Creation and casting The character of Kieran Mitchell had been planned for years but producers were struggling to find a suitable casting choice and subsequently the character was pushed back several times. Adam Rickitt was set to visit New Zealand to work on a film and after talking with a friend who worked in casting at Shortland Street, Rickitt was offered the role. Producer Jason Daniel stated, \\"It just so happened that we were introducing a new character who was a perfect fit for Adam, and after reading the character profile he was very keen to play the role\\". Rickitt was given opportunity of creative freedom as the characters story lines were not fully formed. After learning about the character and his upcoming storylines, Rickitt decided, \\"I‚Äôve got to do this\\". He signed a 3-month recurring contract. In February 2007 the casting was made public and the character was announced to be a \\"mysterious English traveler\\". The character was promised to have a dark past and several romance story lines. Rickitt stated, \\"The character I'm playing has so much potential and I am really excited about getting to know him\\". Kieran made his debut on screen on 15 March 2007. In June, Rickitt extended his stay on the show when he signed a further 1-year contract. In 2008 Rickitt decided to stay as a regular fixture on the soap due to storylines involving romance with Libby Jeffries (Fleur Saville) and the reemergence of Kieran's 'dark side'. In 2009 Steven Zanoski replaced Jason Daniel as producer and decided to significantly change the character of Kieran. However within a year the character had \\"hit a brick wall\\" and producers decided to write the character out. In December 2009, Rickitt was informed he would be getting written out of the soap. Zanoski commented on the departure: \\"I think for that character we would always have had to do something big. He has been larger than life, and has taken the stories on different directions to other characters on Shortland Street. I think part of that was because Kieran didn't have a medical qualification, he wasn't part of the hospital, he formed some of the extended world of Shortland Street as the manager of the bar and he came in with quite a deep, dark back story and that kept playing out on screen in the things he was doing, choices he was making,\\". A 90-minute episode had been planned for 2010 and it was decided Kieran's departure would suit the time frame. Zanoski explained, stating; \\"Being able to tell [Kieran's] story within the context of 90 minutes was a different thing for us. Rather than extending it over a couple of weeks we were able to make quite a satisfying beginning, middle and end within one episode.\\" It was announced in March 2010 that Kieran would be departing the show later in the year and that it would be an 'explosive event' and 'the biggest storyline since Joey'. It was soon confirmed that Kieran would depart on the shows first ever 90-minute episode in August. Kieran made his last appearance on 2 August 2010, where the character was seen falling from a cliff. The scene was the first in the soap to utilize green screen technology and Rickitt was pleased to be a part of it, \\"The best and saddest of days, best because it was a chance to be a part of Shorty's biggest ever production to date, and saddest because I knew it was the closing curtain on the journey of Kieran.\\" Producers ensured that the body of Kieran was not viewed on screen so as to leave an ambiguity over whether he had really died. Zanoski commented on Kieran's final scene, \\"The important thing about this episode is that even though it's saying goodbye to the character of Kieran, it's certainly not an ending.\\" Rickitt also expressed his interest to reprise the role, \\"I don't think it's the end. I love the place too much.\\" Storylines Kieran arrived to Ferndale after crashing his bike and started to flat with Claire Solomon (Emily Robins) and Libby Jeffries (Fleur Saville), whom he started to date. However it soon became clear Kieran had serious memory problems and he was forced to pay off prostitute Suchin Srisai (Kristine Caluya). Kieran had an affair with Claire and she was found murdered. Kieran was arrested but later cleared of the crime and he ended up buying the local restaurant ‚Äì The I.V. following the removal of a brain tumour. Claire's killer was later said to be a serial killer and four more were killed. As things started to go well between him and Libby, Joey Henderson (Johnny Barker) was exposed as the Ferndale Strangler and Kieran tried killing him on a rooftop. During the aftermath, Kieran and Libby reconciled in 2008 but he started to get involved with gangs and hired a hitman to murder business partner Ethan Pierce (Owen Black) after Kieran exposed him as a killer for a medical supplies company, Nessus Bio, and that Ethan had harvested bones for the company. But every time Kieran tried going to the police, Ethan managed to frame Kieran as a worker for the company and linked to the murder of an old woman. In 2009 Libby discovered the true extent of Kieran's crimes and left him. Kieran had a brief fling with Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen) and successfully avoided jail time for his gang affiliations. Kieran was shocked when he discovered Sophie McKay (Kimberley Crossman) had fallen for him but it was not long before the two were in a heated affair and got engaged much to the horror of Sophie's family and several others. Kieran gained many enemies after him and Sophie were exposed and Sophie's ex-boyfriend nearly cost Kieran in his life. Kieran was later shocked when his brother Sean (Thijs Morris)arrived in Ferndale. In Shortland Street's 2009 Cliffhanger, Kieran accidentally hit and killed Morgan Braithwaite (Bonnie Soper) in his car whilst chasing Sean and framed Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield) for the act. Kieran was arrested for the murder during his and Sophie's wedding but Sean took the blame and Kieran and Sophie got married. However, when Kieran was blackmailed by Jane Perry (Sia Trokenheim) for Morgan's death, the marriage ended. Kieran later found himself involved in gangs again and after his life was threatened, Kieran got kidnapped by ex criminal rival White Dragon (Matt Sunderland). Following a chase through a forest, White Dragon fell to his death off a cliff and Kieran sacrificed himself to save Sean after confessing to Morgans death. Kieran's body was found four months later police identified a body and alerted Sophie. Character development In 2009, as part of trying to tame the character down, producers decided to pair the 32-year-old character of Kieran with 17-year-old character, Sophie McKay (Kimberley Crossman). Scenes were aired featuring the characters throughout early 2009 and it soon was made clear that Sophie had developed a crush on the dodgy barman. Crossman commented, \\"I think her attraction to Kieran comes from an adult that she can trust, because her parents are both heavily unfaithful, and he's someone that she looks up to as a successful male. He doesn't have all the crap she's had to deal with, with her past boyfriends about being immature. But it is more than that. She actually genuinely like him and likes the way he makes her feel\\" Rickitt believed the two characters developing feelings were for the right reasons, \\"The thing with Kieran is that even though he's dodgy, he very moralistic ... he will not take advantage of people who he thinks are vulnerable ... She's not trying to sleep with him because she wants something to say to her mates. She's not doing it because she wants to just shag the boss. She's doing it because she's genuinely falling for him.\\" Kieran and Sophie started an affair and Sophie subsequently broke it off Daniel (Ido Drent). However Daniel discovered the torrid affair and took drastic measures, Drent explained, \\"Daniel knew that there was something going on that Sophie wasn't being honest about. But he certainly didn't expect the truth to be this shocking.\\" Daniel ended up getting his friend Tupac Evans (Mauri Oho Stokes) to attack Kieran, knocking him unconscious with a crowbar. In December 2009, Kieran accidentally ran down and killed Morgan Braithwaite (Bonnie Soper) in his car and framed a drunken Rachel McKenna (Angela Bloomfield). However he was crippled with guilt and Rickitt believed it spelt a possible end to Kieran's relationship with Sophie, \\"When Kieran becomes reticent with Sophie because of the guilt he's harboring, she can't help but think it has something to do with her. But when Sophie challenges him to open up to her, Kieran's remorse turns to anger and he sharply backs her off. At this point, Kieran becomes really concerned that he is going to lose Sophie. He knows that he's got to seriously up his game in order to get things back on track.\\" Sophie was left \\"terrified\\" when she learned from Kieran's ex fianc√©, Libby Jeffries (Fleur Saville), that he was still involved in criminal activities. The couple ended up getting married but his guilt over Morgan lead the two to break up. Rickitt believed that there was still hope for the romance however, \\"Kieran is going to love Sophie until the day he dies. For him, it's never over with Sophie and that's one of the things he's carrying guilt for. He spoilt what was probably the most beautiful part of his life.\\" 837,530 households witnessed Kieran sacrifice himself after admitting to killing Morgan. Reception Producer ‚Äì Jason Daniel named the introduction of Kieran as one of the highlights of his time with the soap, stating: \\"People had certain expectations for what he would be like and what type of character we would create for him and I think we subverted them all,\\" Kieran's death saw the show receive huge ratings, becoming the second ever most watched episode of Shortland Street to ever air. Kieran's death was the highest rating episode in over 5 years.

In Spanish it is known as Siete y Media. It is traditionally played in Italy during Christmas holidays. The game is also known in English as Seven and a half. Rules  Sette e mezzo is played with a 40-card deck, a standard deck with eights, nines, and tens removed. The value of cards ace through seven is their pip value (1 through 7), face cards are worth point each. Players compete against the dealer, but not against each other. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways: * Get 7 points on the player's first two cards (called a reale or natural), without a dealer natural 7; * Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 7; or * Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 7. The score of each player‚Äôs hand is calculated by adding the points of their cards. Players must bet before receiving their first card, which is dealt face down. After receiving it, they must decide whether to stand (end their turn) or hit (receive another card). Players may stand or hit as long as they do not go bust (exceed 7). When a player goes bust they must show their face down card and immediately lose their bet, regardless of whether the dealer goes bust later. When a player achieves 7 they must announce it and show their face down card. After all players had their turn, the dealer shows their face down card, then plays with the same rules as the other players. If the dealer goes bust, they must match the bet of all players who didn‚Äôt go bust. If the dealer doesn‚Äôt go bust, all players must show their face down card. The dealer wins against all players who scored lower or tied, collecting their bets, and loses against all players who scored higher paying them back 1:1. Whether a player with a natural 7 beats a dealer with a regular 7 depends on the variant being played. If the role of dealer is not fixed, it is handed over in the direction of play after each hand. The new dealer shuffles the cards before dealing them. =Variants= *Wild card (Italian): the king of coins (or, if playing with French-suited cards, the queen of hearts) is a wild card and may take the value of any other card at the discretion of the owning player, as long as the player has at least another card in their hand. If it is the only card in the player‚Äôs hand, it is only worth . When playing with this variant, it is usually required to shuffle the cards at the end of the hand the wild card was dealt in. *Royal 7: a natural 7 is paid 2:1 and the player who made it becomes the dealer (skipping the regular rotation). If two or more players make 7 at the same time with only two cards, the player closest to the dealer's right becomes the new dealer. If the dealer makes a natural 7, they‚Äôll keep being the dealer for the next hand as well, and players might be required to pay double their bet (unless they obtained a natural 7 themselves). *Triple 7: a certain hand is paid 3:1 (with the same rules as for the royal variant), this hand is either ** a hand containing two 7s ** a natural 7 with the face card being the wild card *Burning: players whose first card is a 4 (or sometimes a 3) are allowed to burn it: the card is discarded it and the player receives a new (face-down) card from the dealer. *Pot-play: the dealer putting an ante in the pot and then playing a single hand against each player in turn. The amount of money currently in the pot is the betting limit for the current hand. If a player wins, they collect their winnings from the pot, if they lose the bet stays in the pot, therefore the limit will be different for each player. After all players had their turn, the dealer collects the amount left in the pot. *Splitting (Spanish): players are allowed to split their hand when they have a face card as their first (face down) card and are dealt another face card as their second hand. To do that, they must double down on their bet; they may then play each hand separately.

One of the top leading men of Burmese cinema in the 1980s and 1990s, Kyaw Thu has starred in over 200 films and has directed several successful films. Since the early 2000s, Kyaw Thu has devoted much time to do social work for the poor, and in the process has gradually emerged as a vocal critic of the Burmese military government.  Early life  Kyaw Thu was born Kyaw Win (·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏, [t…ï…îÃÄ w…™ÃÅ…¥]) on November 2, 1959 to father U Sein Tin and mother Daw Mya Than. He studied Physics major (correspondence) at University of Yangon up to final year. He met his future wife Myint Myint Khin Pe (also known as Shwe Zee Kwet) when they were both attending university at Hlaing Campus. They got married in 1978 during his final year at the university.

Many believe that Kyaw Thu would have won more awards had he been more pliant with the propaganda demands of Myanmar Motion Picture Organization (MMPO), which gives out the annual awards. Until 1994, he refused to do a propaganda film. In 1993, one of his films received popular and critical acclaim but failed to win a single award. In 1994, he finally agreed to do a pro-government film, and came his win with Da-Byi-Thu, which he feels is inferior to his previous work.[3] He won his second Academy Award in 2003 for the Best Director in the film Amay No Bo (·Ä°·Äô·Ä±·Ä∑·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑·Äñ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏).

Enterprise application integration enables efficient information exchanges and business process automation across separate computer applications in a cohesive fashion.  Overview  The term may be better understood by examining each of the three words that comprise the acronym. Integration refers to the objective of the ICC to take a holistic perspective and optimize certain qualities such as cost efficiency, organizational agility and effectiveness, operational risk, customer (internal or external) experience, etc. across multiple functional groups. Competency refers to the expertise, knowledge or capability that the ICC offers as services. Center means that the service is managed or coordinated from a common (central) point independent from the functional areas that it supports. Large organizations are usually sub-divided into functional areas such as marketing, sales, distribution, finance, human resources to name just a few. These functional groups have separate operations and are vertically integrated and are therefore sometimes referred to as \\"silos\\" or \\"stovepipes\\". From an organizational perspective, an ICC is a group of people with special skills, who are centrally coordinated, and offer services to accomplish a mission that requires separate functional areas to work together. Key objectives of an ICC are: * Lead and support enterprise integration (data, system and process) projects with the cooperation/coordination of subject matter experts * Promote Enterprise integration as a formal discipline. For example, data integration will include data warehousing, data migration, data quality management, data integration for service oriented architecture deployments, and data synchronization. Similar system integration will include common messaging services, business service virtualization etc. * Develop staff specialists in integration processes and operations and leverage their expertise company-wide * Assess and select integration technology and tools from the marketplace * Manage integration pilots and projects across the organization * Optimize integration investments across the enterprise level * Leverage economies of scale for the integration tools portfolio at enterprise level ICCs allow companies to: * Optimize scarce resources by combining integration skills, resources, and processes into one group * Reduce project delivery times and development and maintenance costs through effectiveness and efficiency * Improve ROI through creation and reuse of enterprise assets like source definitions, application interfaces, and codified business rules * Decrease duplication of integration related effort across the enterprise * Build on past successes instead of reinventing the wheel with each project * Lower total technology cost of ownership by leveraging technology investments across multiple projects An ICC may be a temporary group in support of a program or a permanent part of the organization. Furthermore, ICC‚Äôs can be established at various scales or levels; within a division of a company, at the enterprise level, or across multiple companies in a supply chain.  History  The term \\"integration competency center\\" and its acronym ICC was popularized by Roy Schulte of Gartner in a series of articles and conference presentations beginning in 2001 with The Integration Competency Center . He picked up the term from one of his colleagues, Gary Long, who found some of his clients using it (they took the established term ‚Äúcompetency center‚Äù and applied it to integration). Prior to that (from 1997 to 2001) Gartner had been referring to it as the central integration team. The concept itself (even before it was given a label) goes back to 1996 in one of Gartner‚Äôs first reports on integration. A major milestone was the publication in 2005 of the first book on the topic: Integration Competency Center: An Implementation MethodologyJohn G. Schmidt and David Lyle (2005), Integration Competency Center, An Implementation Methodology, by John G. Schmidt and David Lyle. The book introduced five ICC organizational models and explored the people, process and technology dimensions of ICC‚Äôs. Several reviews of the book can be found at IT Toolbox and at Amazon. The concept of integration as a competency in the IT domain has now survived for over 10 years and appears to be picking up momentum and broad-based acceptance. These days, ICC‚Äôs are often called, integration center of excellence, SOA center of excellence, the data management center of excellence and other variants. The most advanced ICC's are using Lean Integration practices to optimize end-to-end processes and to drive continuous improvements. Universities are also beginning to include integration topics in their MBA programs and computer science curricula. For example, The College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University has established a Enterprise Informatics and Integration Center with the following mission: \\"The Enterprise Informatics and Integration Center (EI¬≤) will actively engage industry, non-profit, and government agency leaders to address critical issues in enterprise processes, knowledge management, and decision making.\\"  Operating models  There are a number of ways an ICC can be organized and a wide range of responsibilities with which it can be chartered. The ICC book introduced five ICC organizational models and explored the people, process and technology dimensions of ICCs. They include: = Best practices ICC = The primary function of this ICC model is to document best practices. It does not include a central support or development team to implement those standards across projects, and probably not metadata either. To implement a best practices ICC, companies need a flexible development environment that supports diverse teams and that enables the team to enhance and extend existing systems and processes. Such a team might be a subset of an existing enterprise architecture capability and generally consists of a small number of staff (1-5). = Standard services ICC = A standard services ICC provides the same knowledge leverage as a best practices ICC, but enforces technical consistency in software development and hardware choices. A standard services ICC focuses on processes, including standardizing and enforcing naming conventions, establishing metadata standards, instituting change management procedures, and providing standards training. This type of ICC also reviews emerging technologies, selects vendors, and manages hardware and software systems. This style of ICC is often tightly linked with the enterprise architecture team and may be slightly larger than a typical best practices ICC. = Shared services ICC = A shared services ICC provides a supported technical environment and services ranging from development support all the way through to a help desk for projects in production. This type of ICC is significantly more complex than a best practices or Standard Services model. It establishes processes for knowledge management, including product training, standards enforcement, technology benchmarking, and metadata management, and it facilitates impact analysis, software quality, and effective use of developer resources across projects. The organizational structure of a Shared Services ICC is sometimes referred to as a hybrid or federated model which often includes a small central coordinating team plus dotted-line reporting relationships with multiple distributed teams. = Central services ICC = A central services ICC controls integration across the enterprise. It carries out the same processes as the other models, but in addition usually has its own budget and a charge-back methodology. It also offers more support for development projects, providing management, development resources, data profiling, data quality, and unit testing. Because a central services ICC is more involved in development activities than the other models, it requires a production operator and a data integration developer. The staff in a central services ICC does not necessarily need to be a central location and may be distributed geographically; the important distinction is that the staffs have a solid-line reporting relationship to the ICC Director. The size of these teams can vary and may be as large as 10%-15% of the IT staff in an organization. = Self service ICC = The self-service ICC represents the highest level of maturity in an organization. The ICC itself may be almost invisible in that its functions are so ingrained in the day-to-day systems development life-cycle and its operations are so tightly integrated with the infrastructure that it may require only small central team to sustain itself. This ICC model achieves both a highly efficient operation and provides an environment where independent development and innovation can flourish. This goal is achieved by strict enforcement of a set of application integration standards through automated processes enabled by tools and systems.  Key challenges  ICC as a concept is fairly simple. It is embodiment of the IT management best practices to deliver shared services. However, being an organizational concept, it is far more challenging to implement in practice than the conceptual view because every organization has different DNA and it takes specific personalization/customization effort for ICC that makes the ICC initiative successful. Here are some of the common challenges in ICC establishment journey: * Change management in terms of technology, processes, organization structure * Ability of the organization to deal with the pace and quantum of change * Alignment of stakeholders and process owners for ICC strategy * Inappropriate ownership level for ICC program and lack of senior management sponsorship * Highly tactical focus and business program level constraints * Ignoring foundation elements and jumping to implementation directly * Inappropriate funding These issues are important to consider when embarking on the ICC investment since the last leg of the implementation of ICC that's what matters most. Intellectual definition of ICC that is not implemented in the organisation has no real value for the enterprise.

Random House) The Crows of Pearblossom is a 1944 short story written by Aldous Huxley, the English novelist, essayist and critic. In 1967 the story was published by Random House as a children's book illustrated by Barbara Cooney. A picture book version illustrated by Sophie Blackall was published in 2011 by Abrams Books for Young Readers.  Plot  This story, written Christmas of 1944, tells the story of Mr. and Mrs. Crow, who live in a cotton-wood tree at Pearblossom. Due to the Rattlesnake living at the bottom of the tree, Mrs. Crow's eggs are never able to hatch. After catching the snake eating her 297th egg that year (she does not work on Sundays), Mrs. Crow requests that Mr. Crow go into the hole and kill the snake. Thinking better of it, Mr. Crow confers with his wise friend, Mr. Owl. Mr. Owl bakes mud into two stone eggs and paints them to resemble Mrs. Crow's eggs. These dummy eggs are left in the nest to trick the Rattlesnake, who unknowingly eats them the next day. When the eggs get to his stomach, they cause the Rattlesnake such pain, that he thrashes about, tying himself in knots around the branches. Mrs. Crow goes on to hatch \\"four families of seventeen children each\\" and \\"uses the snake as a clothesline on which to hang the little crows' diapers.\\"  History  He wrote it for his niece, Olivia de Haulleville, who spent long periods of time with him and his wife Maria in their desert house in Llano in Antelope Valley, Mojave Desert, California. They took walks together, and Aldous and Maria would delight in telling stories to the little five-year-old girl. When Olivia and her family moved to Pearblossom, four miles from Llano, the Huxleys spent Christmas with the de Haullevilles and made excursions in the desert they loved. Aldous wrote The Crows of Pearblossom during such a Christmas holiday in 1944, mentioning in it Olivia's and her brother Siggy's neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Yost. The Yosts kept a copy of the story, as the original manuscript had been returned to Aldous with the request that he illustrate it. The fire that destroyed his house a few years later, and his own death in 1963, left the story nearly in oblivion for many years. By 1967, Olivia had become Mrs. Yorgo Cassapidis, living on the island of Hydra in Greece with a five-year-old daughter of her own, Melina. Olivia de Haulleville is now living in the Southern California desert near Joshua Tree National Park and is writing her memoirs. In 2000 she published Pilgrimage to Java, An Esoteric History of Buddhism, . Her son, Michael A. Cassapidis, is a Tibetan monk in the Gelug-pa order.

The one country, two systems principle allows the Hong Kong government to administer all areas of government except foreign relations and (military) defence separately from the national Chinese government. Many Hong Kong citizens became concerned about democratic development when the first Chief executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa appeared to have mishandled this issue. Other democracy-related issues involving human rights and universal suffrage (in this case the right to elect Hong Kong leaders through general elections under universal suffrage with no curtailment from the central government of China) became the new focal point for the pro- democracy camp. Attempts to bring Hong Kong citizens to the negotiating table by the British during the Sino-Anglo discussions were rejected by Beijing in the late 1980s. The last governor Chris Patten faced a great deal of opposition in changing the former colony's political system. However, China has been criticized for infringement of the \\"one country, two systems\\" policy. Since the election of Leung Chun-ying as Chief Executive in 2012, democratic development has come to a halt. The Umbrella Revolution was triggered by students disaffected by the continued stalling by Beijing, and particularly the pronouncement of the NPCSC on 31 August 2014 that said Hong Kong had to accept an electoral process for the Chief Executive in 2017 in which up to three candidates would be pre-approved by the Election Committee ‚Äì an electoral college widely seen to be loyal to Beijing authorities.  Under British rule =19th century= In 1856, then governor Sir John Bowring proposed that the constitution of the Legislative Council be changed to increase membership to 13 members, of whom five would be elected by landowners enjoying rents exceeding 10 pounds. This timid attempt at an extremely limited form of democracy (there were only 141 such electors, of whom half were non- British) was rejected by the Colonial Office on the basis that Chinese residents had no respect \\"for the main principles upon which social order rests.\\" Popular grassroots movements were regarded as being greatly discomforting by the authorities. When Asian workers rioted in 1884 after some of their number were fined for refusing to work for French traders, the Peace Preservation Ordinance was enacted, outlawing membership of any organisation deemed \\"incompatible with the peace and good order of the colony\\". Censorship was imposed on the press. Hong Kong's non-elites repeatedly demonstrated their political engagement. They showed their unwillingness to come under government controls and took strike action frequently to protect their freedoms. General and coolie strikes erupted in 1844, 1858, 1862, 1863, 1872, 1888 and 1894. In June 1896, then governor Sir William Robinson sought the direct views of residents on the proposed membership of the Sanitary Board. In the plebiscite taken of British residents, which excluded members of the Imperial and Civil Services, the vast majority favoured a board with a majority of members elected by residents. The plebiscite was seen by the Secretary of State as a threat to the Crown Colony status of Hong Kong and ignored. Robinson flatly rejected it despite having initiated it, concluding that direct administration of the services could be \\"more effectively dealt with\\" by government than by an elected board. =20th century to WWII= In response to the Chinese revolution, the Societies Ordinance was passed, which required registration of all organisations and resurrected the key test seen in the 1884 legislation for ruling them unlawful. The ordinance went further than its predecessor by explicitly targeting chambers of commerce. The administration was particularly concerned about suppressing any activity which might contribute to Hong Kong playing an active role in the tumult across the border. The ordinance banned the free association of workers in unions, imposing restrictive bureaucracy on registration and stringent monitoring of meetings proposed. In the 1920s, workers were organised through labour-contractors who, in parallel with the trading system which enriched the all-powerful compradors, provided a communication channel between the management of foreign hongs and their workers, but entirely for the benefit of the labour contractors. Workers were powerless and roundly exploited under the system. In 1936, the Sanitary Board was reconstituted as the Urban Council and included eight appointed non- Official members, including three of Chinese extraction. =Post-World War II= In 1946, shortly after the war, critical voices were raised against colonialism. Governor Sir Mark Young proposed a 48-member Municipal Council with significant competence to govern, one-third elected by non-Chinese, one third by Chinese institutions and one-third by Chinese individuals, known as the \\"Young Plan\\", believing that, \\"to counter the Chinese government's determination to recover Hong Kong, it was necessary to give local inhabitants a greater stake in the territory by widening the political franchise to include them.\\"Tsang 2004, pp. 143‚Äì144 The reform failed because of much resistance from expatriate companies, a new conservative and mistrustful governor, and London's fears of Hong Kong becoming a political battleground between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China (CPC). Alexander Grantham took over as Governor in 1947, after Sir Mark Young resigned due to ill health. Grantham, a civil servant of many years' standing, was not a supporter of democratic reforms in Hong Kong. Grantham considered Young's plan ill-conceived as he mistrusted the Chinese and doubted their loyalty to Britain and the Crown. He could not see the Young Plan changing that. He blocked the reform process and redrafted the proposals in a two-year stalemate. =1950s= When Mao Zedong's communists defeated the nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, democratic reform in Hong Kong was no longer a priority for London. The Foreign Office was concerned not so much that the Central People's Government would object to democratic changes in Hong Kong, but that Grantham's plan would give them reason to complain that the reforms were \\"undemocratic\\". British-educated lawyer and unofficial legislator Man-kam Lo revised the proposals of 1949 with much support from Grantham. This alternative to the Young Plan, at first approved by the British Government at the end of 1950, was then shelved in 1951 at the recommendation of the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office was concerned that reform at the height of the Korean War would trigger propaganda campaigns by the Communists and could be used by them as an excuse to reclaim Hong Kong. By 1952, the post-war recession began to take its toll on Hong Kong and the 1946 pledge of wide self-determination was forgotten. Grantham convinced London to scrap all plans for political reform on the basis that it did not \\"interest the British electorate\\". Later, when confronted by the Hong Kong public, he blamed London. All major democratic reforms for Hong Kong were dropped by British Cabinet decision. In October 1952, the British Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton announced that the time was \\"inopportune for...constitutional changes of a major character\\". Democratisation of Urban Council Ultimately, however, Governor Grantham allowed minor reform proposals and, as a result, two pre-war existing seats in the virtually powerless Urban Council were directly elected in 1952; this was doubled to four the following year. In 1956, the body became semi-elected but on a restricted franchise, which had expanded from some 9,000 registered voters in 1952 to only about 250,000 eligible voters 14 years later. Eligibility reached about half a million in 1981 but only 34,381 bothered to register, probably on account of the fact that the body's powers extended only to cleaning, running bathhouses and public lavatories, hawker control, supervising beaches, burying the dead, and the like. Records declassified in 2014 show discussions about self-government between British and Hong Kong governments resumed in 1958, prompted by the British expulsion from India and growing anti-colonial sentiment in the remaining Crown Colonies. Zhou Enlai, representing the CPC at the time, warned, however, that this \\"conspiracy\\" of self-governance would be a \\"very unfriendly act\\" and that the CPC wished the present colonial status of Hong Kong to continue. China was facing increasing isolation in a Cold War world and the party needed Hong Kong for contacts and trade with the outside world. = 1960s = China's leaders explicitly wanted to \\"preserve the colonial status of Hong Kong\\". Liao Chengzhi, a senior Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, said in 1960 that China \\"shall not hesitate to take positive action to have Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories liberated\\" should the status quo (i.e. colonial administration) be changed. The warning killed any democratic development for the next three decades.Jacobs, Andrew (27 Oct 2014). \\"Hong Kong Democracy Standoff, Circa 1960\\" . The New York Times = 1970s = In the absence of democratic legitimacy, the colonial government slowly implemented a system of formal advisory bodies, integrating interest groups into the policy-making process during the 1970s, which enabled grievances and controversies to be discussed and resolved.Cheng (2014), p.216. =1980s= Although full universal suffrage was never granted by the British to its colony before the handover in 1997, some democratic reform began in 1984. Following the historic meeting in 1979 between Deng Xiaoping and then governor Murray MacLehose, a Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong was issued by the colonial government in July 1984. It included proposals aimed at developing a system of more localised government, which included the introduction of indirect elections to the LegCo (Legislative Council) the following year.Cheung, Gary (14 November 2009), \\"Universal suffrage an elusive goal\\", South China Morning Post The Sino-British Joint Declaration stated that \\"the legislature of the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] shall be constituted by elections\\"; then British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe further promised the democratic process would start \\"in the years immediately ahead\\", but they stalled due to opposition from Beijing, local business interests as represented by Executive Council, and the British Foreign Office under the pretext that it would bring chaos to Hong Kong.Vittachi, Nury (5 September 2014) \\"Hong Kong, City of Broken Promises\\" . Asia Sentinel Declaring that \\"full weight be given to representation of the economic and professional sectors essential to future confidence and prosperity of Hong Kong\\", the government proposed 12 legislators, who were ‚Äì being members of the Legislative Council ‚Äì elected by nine trade-based seats, or \\"functional bodies\\" ‚Äì commercial, industrial, financial, labour, social services, education, legal, medical and engineering ‚Äì the following year. Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, later to become leading democrats, were among those elected in 1985.Cheung, Gary (18 Jan 2010), \\"Functional seats plan mooted a month after Deng, MacLehose met\\", South China Morning Post Democracy activists ‚Äì pressure groups, religious groups and community organisations ‚Äì attended a mass rally at Ko Shan Theatre in Hung Hom in November 1986. The rally was a milestone in Hong Kong's fledgling pro- democracy movement. One of the participating groups, calling themselves the 'group of 190', demanded direct elections for LegCo in 1988, and a faster pace of democratic development after the Handover. In 1987, many surveys indicated that there was more than 60% popular support for direct elections. The government, under governor David Wilson, issued another green paper in 1987 proposing direct LegCo elections for 1988. However, the proposal was ruled out after a government consultation concluded that people were 'sharply divided' over its introduction that year. As Xinhua stepped up its presence in Hong Kong by opening district offices, pro-Beijing forces worked actively to stifle the implementation of direct elections for the legislature in 1988 by initially identifying supporters, fielding candidates and targeting opponents aiming to win at the district board elections.Cheng (2014), p.214. The Hong Kong government was criticised for manipulating the views of Beijing-friendly groups to ensure that no clear mandate for direct elections in 1988 emerged. Following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and faced with concern over the Beijing government, support for establishment parties fell and pro- democracy parties' fortunes rose. Hong Kong government decided to introduce 18 directly elected seats to the legislature in 1991. =1990s until the handover= After the departure of Governor David Wilson in 1992, Chris Patten the new governor of Hong Kong, began moves to unilaterally democratise the territory by allowing for the election of half the Legislative Council by universal suffrage, and in the process incurring the wrath of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Patten had judged that: \\"People in Hong Kong are perfectly capable of taking a greater share in managing their own affairs in a way that is responsible, mature, restrained, sensible\\". During the final days of British rule, the British wanted to play the political game; the Patten administration legislated for labour rights and collective bargaining. However, the legislation was cancelled by the provisional legislature upon taking office in 1997.Cheng (2014), p.218. Patten's push for reform was strongly opposed at the time by vested interests within LegCo and by former ambassador to China Percy Cradock. Patten's moves created a hostile climate that lasted until Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997. Nevertheless, Patten extracted undertakings from a PRC representative: > How Hong Kong develops democracy (Remember that the people did not have > democracy under colonization of the British) in the future is a matter > entirely within the sphere of Hong Kong's autonomy, and the central > government cannot intervene. > ‚Äî Lu Ping, (as quoted in the People's Daily, 18 March 1993) The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated the following year that the democratic election of all Legislative Council members by universal suffrage was \\"a question to be decided by the Hong Kong SAR itself and it needs no guarantee by the Chinese Government\\". Post-1997 Under what Beijing called the 'one country, two systems' model, the move towards greater democracy has stalled. The Legislative Council set up by Patten to be partially elected by universal suffrage was dismantled by the PRC and replaced by an entirely unelected provisional legislature. Elections in May 1998 to fill a new legislature saw only 20 seats directly elected, with the remainder determined by a layered selection procedure designed to ensure maximum representation by pro-establishment parties at the expense of pan-democrats. An article in Journal of Democracy argued that \\"Hong Kong's political development has lagged in the face of well-documented PRC efforts to impede progress toward direct elections, universal suffrage, and other democratizing reforms that Beijing fears might loosen its control.\\"Ming Sing, Hong Kong‚Äôs Democrats Hold Their Own Journal of Democracy Volume 20, Number 1.

Pro-democracy activists, including Emily Lau, Andrew Cheng and Lee Cheuk-yan, insisted this threatened Hong Kong's welfare by denying the city full democracy. A \\"Tomb of democracy\\" was established outside the building, with activists shouting \\"oppose the phony election\\". The activists were dragged away by the police and detained for four hours. Since 1997, as a result of the executive-led model preferred by Beijing and the lack of democratic accountability of the Chief Executive, and the marginalisation of the pro-democracy camp in the legislature by functional constituencies and split voting between constituency groups, giving pro-Beijing groups an effective veto over all motions, the pan-democrats have relied more on supervisory and control issues, backed by public opinion.Ma, Ngok. Political Development in Hong Kong: State, Political Society, and Civil Society, pg. 129. Hong Kong University Press (2007). Following a massive protest against a proposal to implement Article 23, which took place on 1 July 2003 and attracted half a million marchers, Beijing appointed Zeng Qinghong to oversee policy issues for Hong Kong. In April 2004, Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) spokesman Lau Kwong-wah set aside without explanation the party's 2012 declared goal for universal suffrage, one day after fellow DAB member Chan Kam-lam reiterated on the campaign trail the party's plan to amend the party platform for the third time to promise full democracy in 2012. On 26 April, Beijing reneged on earlier promises to allow Hong Kong the right to determine the timetable to universal suffrage.Ching, Frank (20 September 2010) \\"Historical context may clarify reform debate\\", South China Morning Post when the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) ruled out universal suffrage before 2012.Yeung, Rikkie.

At the first meeting of the new Legislative Council Constitutional Affairs Panel on 18 October, chairman Lui Ming-wah was ambushed by pan- democrats in a surprise vote on constitutional reforms. After debating for over three hours, when democrats outnumbered pro-government lawmakers, Fernando Cheung raised a motion proposing a public referendum on whether people supported the government's 'go-slow proposals' or whether both elections should be by universal suffrage. The panel chairman stalled on the vote for more than 15 minutes, allowing the pro-government legislators to be called back to vote. However, the meeting descended into chaos and no vote was taken; the meeting was adjourned to the following month. Democrats called on Lui to resign from his post for his abuse of procedure.Ng, Michael (19 October 2004). Vote rebuff brings chaos to chamber, The Standard. Retrieved 3 May 2010.

Three pan-democrats abstained. Martin Lee was concerned that Beijing may not have been aware of the strength of public opinion in Hong Kong on the matter of universal suffrage.

The nominations threshold would be set at 50 EC members, and the candidate for CE would be elected in a one-person, one-vote election. Ultimately, the nomination committee would be scrapped.

While notionally allowing for universal suffrage, the decision imposes the standard that \\"the Chief Executive shall be a person who loves the country and loves Hong Kong,\\" and stipulates \\"the method for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage must provide corresponding institutional safeguards for this purpose\\". The decision states that for the 2017 Chief Executive election, a nominating committee, mirroring the present 1,200-member Election Committee be formed to nominate two to three candidates, each of whom must receive the support of more than half of the members of the nominating committee. After the popular election of one of the nominated candidates, the Chief Executive- elect \\"will have to be appointed by the Central People's Government.\\" The process of forming the 2016 Legislative Council would be unchanged, but following the new process for the election of the Chief Executive, a new system to elect the Legislative Council via universal suffrage would be developed with the approval of Beijing. The Standing Committee decision is set to be the basis for electoral reform crafted by the Legislative Council. Hundreds of suffragists gathered on the night of the Beijing announcement near the government offices to protest the decision. In an opinion poll carried out by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, only 36.1% of 802 people surveyed between 8‚Äì15 October accepted the NPCSC's decision but 55.6% were willing to accept it if the HKSAR Government democratised the nominating committee during the second phase of the public consultation period.

The country is experiencing a \\"super-aging\\" society both in rural and urban areas. According to 2014 estimates, 33.0% of the Japanese population is above the age of 60, 25.9% are aged 65 or above, and 12.5% are aged 75 or above. People aged 65 and older in Japan make up a quarter of its total population, estimated to reach a third by 2050. Japan had a post-war baby boom between 1947 and 1949. In 1948, Japan legalized abortion under special circumstances. The Eugenic Protection Law of 1948 allowed the involuntary sterilization of babies with intellectual disabilities until the law was overturned in 1996. This was followed by a prolonged period of low fertility, resulting in the aging population of Japan. The dramatic aging of Japanese society as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and high life expectancy is expected to continue. Japan's population began to decline in 2011. In 2014, Japan's population was estimated at 127 million; this figure is expected to shrink to 107 million (16%) by 2040 and to 97 million (24%) by 2050 should the current demographic trend continue. Japanese citizens largely view Japan as comfortable and modern, resulting in no sense of a population crisis. The government of Japan has responded to concerns about the stress that demographic changes place on the economy and social services with policies intended to restore the fertility rate and make the elderly more active in society.  Aging dynamics  In 1950, Japan's population of people above 65 years was only 4.9%. However, the rate increased to 11.7% in 1990. The number of Japanese people with ages 65 years or older nearly quadrupled in the last forty years, to 33 million in 2014, accounting for 26% of Japan's population. In the same period, the number of children (aged 14 and younger) decreased from 24.3% of the population in 1975 to 12.8% in 2014. The number of elderly people surpassed the number of children in 1997, and sales of adult diapers surpassed diapers for babies in 2014. This change in the demographic makeup of Japanese society, referred to as population ageing (', ), has taken place in a shorter span of time than in any other country. According to projections of the population with the current fertility rate, over 65s will account for 40% of the population by 2060, and the total population will fall by a third from 128 million in 2010 to 87 million in 2060.Population Projections for Japan (January 2012): 2011 to 2060, table 1-1 (National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, retrieved 13 January 2016). Economists at Tohoku University established a countdown to national extinction, which estimates that Japan will have only one remaining child in 4205. These predictions prompted a pledge by Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe to halt population decline at 100 million. Causes \\"hinoe uma\\" year which is viewed as ill-omened in the Japanese Zodiac. The aging of the Japanese population is a result of one of the world's lowest fertility rates combined with the highest life expectancy. =High life expectancy= Japan's life expectancy in 2016 was 85 years. The life expectancy is 81.7 for males and 88.5 for females. Since Japan's overall population is shrinking due to low fertility rates, the aging population is rapidly increasing. Factors such as improved nutrition, advanced medical and pharmacological technologies reduced the prevalence of diseases, improving living conditions. Moreover, peace and prosperity following World War II was integral to the massive economic growth of post-war Japan, leading to longer lifespans. Proportion of health care spending has dramatically increased as Japan's older population spends time in hospitals and visits physicians. 2.9% people aged 75‚Äì79 were in a hospital and 13.4% visited physicians on any given day in 2011. Life expectancy at birth has increased rapidly from the end of World War II, when the average was 54 years for women and 50 for men, as a result of improvements in medicine and nutrition, and the percentage of the population aged 65 years and older has increased steadily from the 1950s. The advancement of life expectancy translated into a depressed mortality rate until the 1980s, but mortality has increased again to 10.1 per 1000 people in 2013, the highest since 1950. =Low fertility rate= The percentage of births to unmarried women in selected countries, 1980 and 2007. As can be seen in the figure, Japan has not followed the trend of Western countries of children born outside of marriage to the same degree. Japan's total fertility rate (the number of children born to each woman in her lifetime) has been below the replacement threshold of 2.1 since 1974 and reached a historic low of 1.26 in 2005. Experts believe that signs of a slight recovery reflect the expiration of a \\"tempo effect,\\" as fertility rates accommodate a major shift in the timing and number of children, rather than any positive change. As of 2016, the TFR was 1.41 children born/woman. =Economy and culture= A range of economic and cultural factors contributed to the decline in childbirth during the late 20th century: later and fewer marriages, higher education, urbanization, increase in nuclear family households (rather than extended family), poor work‚Äìlife balance, increased participation of women in the workforce, a decline in wages and lifetime employment along with a high gender pay gap, small living spaces, and the high cost of raising a child.http://www.demogr.mpg.de/papers/working/wp-2013-004.pdf Many young people face economic insecurity due to a lack of regular employment. About 40% of Japan's labor force is non-regular, including part-time and temporary workers. Non-regular employees earn about 53 percent less than regular ones on a comparable monthly basis, according to the Labor Ministry. Young men in this group are less likely to consider marriage or to be married.IPSS, \\"Attitudes toward Marriage and Family among Japanese Singles\\" (2011), p. 4. Although most married couples have two or more children,National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (IPSS). \\"Marriage Process and Fertility of Japanese Married Couples.\\" (2011). pp. 9‚Äì14. a growing number of young people postpone or entirely reject marriage and parenthood. Conservative gender roles often mean that women are expected to stay home with the children, rather than work. Between 1980 and 2010, the percentage of the population who had never married increased from 22% to almost 30%, even as the population continued to age, and by 2035 one in four men will not marry during their prime parenthood years. The Japanese sociologist Masahiro Yamada coined the term for unmarried women in their late 20s and 30s who continue to live with their parents. =Fatigue and overworked= Yoshoku Sake Co. conducted a survey among working women between 20 and 39 years old in Japan in 2017. More than 60% of women answered that they cannot relax (over-tension, fatigue). They are not interested in wasting time to pursue love relationships () that lead to nowhere. The amount of work and responsibility has increased over the years while their physical strength declines with age. Women answered the cause of fatigue in the poll as: 1. Human relations of work (50.2%), 2. Content of work (44.5%), 3. Temperature and humidity (35.2%), 4. Work hours, overtime work and other workloads (30.8%), 5. Financial circumstances, financial unrest (27.2%). The survey by Yoshoku Sake Co. found that nearly 60% of people suffer from 1. chronic fatigue or 2. feel tired to love because of the feeling was or got cold or 3. the lover or family get irritated by little things. Women have joined the scores of overworked male employees and are too tired for dating. When women do have enough energy to go on a date, 1 in 4 women said they fell asleep during the date. Still 80% of the female respondents said they want a husband to settle down. They find stability () more important than showing off with a wedding. Increasing numbers of women use matchmaking () to find a husband. Meanwhile, men are not interested in marriage, but 80% want a girlfriend. Men are reluctant to marry, because it would add complications, baggage to their lives and reduce their disposable income. In the 1980s, 60% to 70% of young people in their 20s were in a relationship. In 2017, young people (in their 20s) in a relationship had become part of the minority. =Virginity rates= In 2015, 1 in 10 Japanese adults in their 30s were virgins and had no heterosexual sex experience. Women with heterosexual inexperience from 18 to 39 years old was 21.7 percent in 1992 and increased to 24.6 percent in 2015. Men with heterosexual inexperience from 18 to 39 years old was 20 percent in 1992 and increased to 25.8 percent in 2015. Men with stable jobs and a high income are more likely to have sex. Low income men are 10 to 20 times more likely to have no heterosexual sex experience. Women with lower income are more likely to have had intercourse. This is according to the National Fertility Survey of Japan by the Japanese National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Men who are unemployed are 8 times more likely to be virgins and men who are part-time or temporary employed have a 4 times higher virginity rate. This means that money and social status are important for men in the dating market. =Herbivore men= There is a phenomenon of Herbivore men (). These men are not interested in getting married or having a girlfriend. A 2010 survey with single men found that 61% of men in their 20s and 70% of men in their 30s call themselves herbivores. However, the term \\"herbivorous men\\" carry quite a broad meaning-- it does not only mean men who do not pursue romantic interest, but could also imply men who do not conform to the traditional characteristics of a man; men who are gentle, kind and lack romantic assertiveness. Effects Japan's demographic age composition from 1940 to 2010, with projections out to 2060 Demographic trends are altering relations within and across generations, creating new government responsibilities and changing many aspects of Japanese social life. The aging and decline of the working-age population has triggered concerns about the future of the nation's workforce, the potential for economic growth, and the solvency of the national pension and healthcare services.Hashimoto, Ryutaro (attributed). General Principles Concerning Measures for the Aging Society. Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan. Retrieved 2011-3-5. =Social= A smaller population could make the country's crowded metropolitan areas more livable, and the stagnation of economic output might still benefit a shrinking workforce. However, the low birthrate and high life expectancy has also inverted the standard population pyramid, forcing a narrowing base of young people to provide and care for a bulging older cohort even as they try to form families of their own. In 2014, the aged dependency ratio (the ratio of people over 65 to those age 15‚Äì65, indicating the ratio of the dependent elderly population to those of working age) was 40%, meaning two aged dependents for every five workers. This is expected to increase to 60% by 2036 and to nearly 80% by 2060.Population Projections for Japan (January 2012): 2011 to 2060, table 1-4 (National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, retrieved 13 January 2016). Elderly Japanese have traditionally commended themselves to the care of their adult children, and government policies still encourage the creation of , where a married couple cares for both children and parents. In 2015, 177,600 people between the ages of 15 and 29 were caring directly for an older family member. However, the migration of young people into Japan's major cities, the entrance of women into the workforce, and the increasing cost of care for both young and old dependents have required new solutions, including nursing homes, adult daycare centers, and home health programs. Every year Japan closes 400 primary and secondary schools, converting some of them to care centers for the elderly. There are special nursing homes in Japan that offer service and assistance to more than 30 residents. In 2008, it has been recorded that there were approximate 6,000 special nursing homes available that cared for 420,000 Japanese elders. With many nursing homes in Japan, the demand for more caregivers is high. In Japan, Family caregivers are preferred as the main caregiver, because it is a better support system if an elderly person is related to his/her caregiver. Therefore, it is possible that Japanese elderly people can perform activities of daily living (ADLs) with little assistance and live longer if his/her caregiver is a family caregiver. Many elderly people live alone and isolated, and every year thousands of deaths go unnoticed for days or even weeks, in a modern phenomenon known as . The disposable income in Japan's older population has increased business in biomedical technologies research in cosmetics and regenerative medicine. =Political= The Greater Tokyo Area is virtually the only locality in Japan to see population growth, mostly due to internal migration from other parts of the country. Between 2005 and 2010, 36 of Japan's 47 prefectures shrank by as much as 5%, and many rural and suburban areas are struggling with an epidemic of abandoned homes (8 million across Japan). Masuda Hiroya, a former Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications who heads the private think tank Japan Policy Council, estimated that about half the municipalities in Japan could disappear between now and 2040 as young people, especially young women, move from rural areas into Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, where around half of Japan's population is already concentrated. The government is establishing a regional revitalization task force and focusing on developing regional hub cities, especially Sapporo, Sendai, Hiroshima, and Fukuoka. Internal migration and population decline have created a severe regional imbalance in electoral power, where the weight of a single vote depends on where it was cast. Some depopulated districts send three times as many representatives per voter to the National Diet as their growing urban counterparts. In 2014, the Supreme Court of Japan declared the disparities in voting power violate the Constitution, but the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which relies on rural and older voters, has been slow to make the necessary realignment. The increasing proportion of elderly people has a major impact on government spending and policies. As recently as the early- 1970s, the cost of public pensions, health care and welfare services for the aged amounted to only about 6% of Japan's national income. In 1992 that portion of the national budget was 18%, and it is expected that by 2025 28% of national income will be spent on social welfare. Because the incidence of chronic disease increases with age, the health care and pension systems are expected to come under severe strain. In the mid- 1980s the government began to reevaluate the relative burdens of government and the private sector in health care and pensions, and it established policies to control government costs in these programs. The large share of elderly inflation averse voters may also hinder the political attractiveness of pursuing higher inflation consistent with the evidence that ageing may lead to lower inflation. With the increasing older population and decreasing young population, 38% percent of the population will be people aged 65 and older by 2065. This concludes that Japan has the highest amount of public debt in the world because of the low fertility rates and aging population. Japan's government has spent almost half of its tax revenue trying to recover from their debt. According to IMF, Japan has a 246.14 debt percentage of GDP making it the highest public debt. =Economic= Real GDP change in Japan (1956 to 2008) Since the 1980s, there has been an increase of older-age workers and a shortage of young workers in Japan's workforce, from employment practices to benefits to the participation of women. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated in 2002 that Japan would experience an 18% decrease of young workers in its workforce and 8% decrease in its consumer population by 2030. The Japanese labor market is already under pressure to meet demands for workers, with 125 jobs for every 100 job seekers at the end of 2015, as older generations retire and younger generations become smaller in quantity. Japan made a radical change in how its healthcare system is regulated by introducing long-term care insurance in 2000. The proportion of old Japanese citizens will soon level off, however; there is a decline in young population due to zero growth, death exceeding the births. For example, number of young people under the age of 19 in Japan will constitute only 13 percent in the year 2060, which used to be 40 percent in 1960. Japan's aging population is considered economically prosperous profiting the large corporations. Lawson Inc., a Japanese convenience store chain has salons for senior citizens that feature adult wipes and diapers, strong detergents to eliminate urine on bed mats, straw cups, gargling basins, and rice and water. The decline in the working population is impacting the national economy. It is causing a shrinkage of the nation's military. The government has focused on medical technologies such as regenerative medicines and cell therapy to recruit and retain more older population into the work force. A range of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have also pioneered new practices for retaining workers beyond mandated retirement ages, such as through workplace improvements to create working environments better suited to older workers as well as new job tasks specifically for older workers. Mounting labor shortages in the 1980s and 90s led many Japanese companies to increase the mandatory retirement age from 55 to 60 or 65, and today many allow their employees to continue working after official retirement. The growing number of retirement age people has put strain on the national pension system. In 1986, the government increased the age at which pension benefits begin from 60 to 65, and shortfalls in the pension system have encouraged many people of retirement age to remain in the workforce and have driven some others into poverty. The retirement age may go even higher in the future if Japan continues to have older age populations in its overall population. A study by the UN Population Division released in 2000 found that Japan would need to raise its retirement age to 77 (or allow net immigration of 17 million by 2050) to maintain its worker-to-retiree ratio. Consistent immigration into Japan may prevent further population decline, therefore, it is encouraged that Japan develops policies that will support large influx of young immigrants. Less desirable industries, such as agriculture and construction, are more threatened than others. The average farmer in Japan is 70 years old, and while about a third of construction workers are 55 or older, including many who expect to retire within the next ten years, only one in ten are younger than 30. The decline in working-aged cohorts may lead to a shrinking economy if productivity does not increase faster than the rate of Japan's decreasing workforce. The OECD estimates that similar labor shortages in Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Sweden will depress the European Union's economic growth by 0.4 percentage points annually from 2000 to 2025, after which shortages will cost the EU 0.9 percentage points in growth. In Japan labor shortages will lower growth by 0.7 percentage points annually until 2025, after which Japan will also experience a 0.9 percentage points loss in growth. Places with high birthrates These are places in Japan with significant higher birthrates than the national average: =Nagareyama= The city Nagareyama in Chiba Prefecture is 30 kilometers from Tokyo. Most Japanese cities have a shortage of daycare centers and no transit services for children. In early 2000, Nagareyama had an exodus of young people. Men and women are usually occupied with jobs during daytime. However, Nagareyama lets women pursue their career while their children spend time in childcare facilities. In 2003, mayor Yoshiharu Izaki made investments in childcare centers a primary focus of the city's government. It includes a transit service at Nagareyama-centralpark Station where parents can drop off their children on their way to work. The children are shuttled with buses to daycare centers. Senior people of the local community help with shuttling the children. Many parents say this transit service was one of the biggest reasons for them to move to Nagareyama. The result is over the past 13 years (2006-2019) the population has grown by more than 20%. 85% of children have more than one sibling. Young children are expected to outnumber elderly in the future. Parents worry less about having more children, because the whole community helps with raising children and parents don't feel isolated. People in Nagareyama have a strong local network, with a friendly neighborhood. People share information and concerns. There are also many local events and community spaces where children and elderly interact. There's a summer camp for children while their parents work during holidays. These family friendly approaches lured young working parents from Tokyo to Nagareyama. =Okinawa Prefecture= Okinawa prefecture has the highest birthrate in Japan for more than 40 years since recording began in 1899. Okinawa was the only prefecture with a natural population increase compared to the rest of Japan in 2018. The fertility rate was 1.89 while Tokyo had the lowest of 1.20 and the national average was 1.42 in 2018.Number of newborns in Japan fell to record low while population dropped faster than ever in 2018 There were 15,732 births and 12,157 deaths according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The average age of marriage is lower in Okinawa at 30 years for men and 28.8 years for women. The national average is 31.1 years for men and 29.4 years for women. Anthropologist Dr. Thang Leng Leng (National University of Singapore) said families tend to have more than two children because of ‚ÄúOkinawa‚Äôs sense of social norms, in terms of ‚Äòthis is how things should be‚Äô,‚Äù. It's considered normal to marry and then have children. This is despite Okinawa having less welfare for children compared to other regions in Japan. It's not unusual for women in their 40s to have children. 1 in 20 babies born at the Nanbu Tokushukai Hospital are conceived via IVF. Living in Okinawa is less stressful due to lower incomes and lower living costs. Raising a child is less expensive and fewer students attend university in Okinawa. Dr. Thang said people in Okinawa are more relaxed with a tropical culture and not so punctual as the rest of Japan. Working in Okinawa is more laid back. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's workplace policies enable returning mothers to work more flexible and leave work earlier. There's less competition in the workplace due to less high paying large corporations compared to Osaka and Tokyo. Pediatrician, Chuken Miyagi said there's a culture of mutual help and support called . Grandparents and relatives live relatively close to help family members and mothers with raising their children. There's a high sense of closeness among the people of Okinawa, because society is largely rural with more living space. In big cities like Tokyo, people frequently rent houses and live there temporarily which hampers the development of close bonds with the neighborhood and local people. Okinawa has increasing numbers of ; fathers who are actively involved in child-rearing. The ratio of mothers to fathers at the Jinen Pediatric Clinic in Okinawa is 7 to 3 compared to 10 to 0 in mainland Japan (2018). Government policies The Japanese government is addressing demographic problems by developing policies to encourage fertility and keep more of its population, especially women and elderly, engaged in the workforce. Incentives for family formation include expanded opportunities for childcare, new benefits for those who have children, and a state-sponsored dating service. Some policies have focused on engaging more women in the workplace, including longer maternity leave and legal protections against pregnancy discrimination, known in Japan as . However, \\"Womenomics,\\" the set of policies intended to bring more women into the workplace as part of Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe's economic recovery plan, has struggled to overcome cultural barriers and entrenched stereotypes. These policies could prove useful for bringing women back into the workforce after having children, but they can also encourage the women who opt not to have children to join the workforce. The Japanese government has introduced other policies to address the growing elderly population as well, especially in rural areas. Many young people end up moving to the city in search of work, leaving behind a growing elderly population and a smaller work force to take care of them. Because of this, Japan's national government has tried to improve welfare services such as long-term care facilities and other services that can help families at home such as day-care or in-home nursing assistance. The Gold Plan was introduced in 1990 to improve these services and attempted to reduce the burden of care placed on families, followed by long-term care insurance (LTCI) in 2000. These plans have been upgraded and revised over the years to provide more local welfare services and institutions in rural areas, yet the rapidly increasing elderly population makes these efforts difficult to maintain. = Immigration = A net decline in population due to a historically low birth rate has raised the issue of immigration, as a way to compensate for labor shortages. While public opinion polls tend to show low support for immigration, most people support an expansion in working-age migrants on a temporary basis to maintain Japan's economic status. Comparative reviews show that Japanese attitudes are broadly neutral and place Japanese acceptance of migrants in the middle of developed countries. Immigrants would have to increase by eight percent in order for Japan's economy to be stable. Japan's government is first trying to increase tourism rates which increases their economy and brings in foreign workers. The government has also recruited international students which allow foreigners to begin work and potentially stay in Japan to help the economy. However, Japan is strict when accepting refugees into their country. Only 27 people out of 7,500 refugee applicants were granted into Japan in 2015. Though, Japan provides high levels of foreign and humanitarian aid. In 2016, there was a 44% increase in asylum seekers to Japan from Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Since Japan did not desire low-skilled workers to enter, many people went through the asylum route instead. This allowed immigrants to apply for the asylum and begin work six months after the application. However, it did not allow foreigners without valid visas to apply for work. = Work-life balance = Japan has focused its policies on the work-life balance with the goal of improving the conditions for increasing the birth rate. To address these challenges, Japan has established goals to define the ideal work-life balance that would provide the environment for couples to have more children with the passing of the Child Care and Family Care Leave Law, which took effect in June 2010.Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Revised Child Care and Family Care Leave Law,‚Äù http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/index.html, accessed May 22, 2011. The law provides both mothers and fathers with an opportunity to take up to one year of leave after the birth of a child (with possibility to extend the leave for another 6 months if the child is not accepted to enter nursery school) and allows employees with preschool-age children the following allowances: up to five days of leave in the event of a child's injury or sickness, limits on the amount of overtime in excess of 24 hours per month based on an employee's request, limits on working late at night based on an employee's request, and opportunity for shorter working hours and flex time for employees.Japanese government's Employment Service Center ‚ÄúÈõáÁî®Á∂ôÁ∂öÁµ¶‰ªò‚Äù https://www.hellowork.go.jp/insurance/insurance_continue.html, Retrieved April 24, 2017 The goals of the law would strive to achieve the following results in 10 years are categorized by the female employment rate (increase from 65% to 72%), percentage of employees working 60 hours or more per week (decrease from 11% to 6%), rate of use of annual paid leave (increase from 47% to 100%), rate of child care leave (increase from 72% to 80% for females and .6% to 10% for men), and hours spent by men on child care and housework in households with a child under six years of age (increase from 1 hour to 2.5 hours a day). Comparisons with other countries Japan's population is aging faster than any other country on the planet. The population of those 65 years or older roughly doubled in 24 years, from 7.1% of the population in 1970 to 14.1% in 1994. The same increase took 61 years in Italy, 85 years in Sweden, and 115 years in France. Life expectancy for women in Japan is 87 years, five years more than that of the U.S. Men in Japan with a life expectancy of 81 years, have surpassed U.S. life expectancy by four years. Japan also has more centenarians than any other country (58,820 in 2014, or 42.76 per 100,000 people). Almost one in five of the world's centenarians live in Japan, and 87% of them are women. In contrast to Japan, a more open immigration policy has allowed Australia, Canada, and the United States to grow their workforce despite low fertility rates. An expansion of immigration is often rejected as a solution to population decline by Japan's political leaders and people. Reasons include a fear of foreign crime, a desire to preserve cultural traditions, and a belief in the ethnic and racial homogeneity of the Japanese nation. Historically, European countries have had the largest elderly populations by proportion as they became developed nations earlier and experienced the subsequent drop in fertility rates, but many Asian and Latin American countries are quickly catching up. As of 2015, 22 of the 25 oldest countries are located in Europe, but Japan is currently the oldest country in the world and its rapidly aging population displays a trend that other parts of Asia such as South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are expected to follow by 2050. As recently developed nations continue to experience improved health care and lower fertility rates, the growth of the elderly population will continue to rise. In 1970‚Äì1975, only 19 countries had a fertility rate that can be considered below-replacement fertility and there were not any countries with exceedingly low fertility (<1.3 children); however, between 2000‚Äì2005, there were 65 countries with below-replacement fertility and 17 with exceedingly low fertility. While there has been a global trend of lower fertility and longer life expectancy, it is first evident in the more developed countries and occurs more rapidly in developing or recently developed countries. One of the most astounding aspects of Japan's elderly population, in particular, is that it is both fast-growing and has one of the highest life expectancies equating to a larger elderly population and an older one. According to the World Health Organization, Japanese people are able to live 75 years without any disabilities and fully healthy compared to other countries. Also, American women usually live to around 81 years and American men 76; but compared to Japan, women live to around 87 years and men to 80 years. There is demographic data that shows Japan is an older and more quickly aging society than United States. Japan, also, has reached the condition aging much faster than other developed countries, and they have the highest life expectancy rate among developed countries. They, also, have the highest proportion of the elderly population as well with the highest population decline of developed countries. thumb Japan is leading the world in aging demographics, but the other countries of East Asia are following a similar trend. In South Korea, where the fertility rate often ranks among the lowest in the OECD (1.21 in 2014), the population is expected to peak in 2030. The smaller states of Singapore and Taiwan are also struggling to boost fertility rates from record lows and to manage aging populations. More than a third of the world's elderly (65 and older) live in East Asia and the Pacific, and many of the economic concerns raised first in Japan can be projected to the rest of the region. India's population is aging exactly like Japan, but with a 50-year lag. A study of the populations of India and Japan for the years 1950 to 2015 combined with median variant population estimates for the years 2016 to 2100 shows that India is 50 years behind Japan on the aging process.

Design and development It was developed as a luxury version of the Travel Air 5000 marketed principally as an executive aircraft, although its size proved popular with regional airlines, which purchased most of the roughly 150 machines built. The 6000 was a high-wing braced monoplane with a fuselage constructed of steel tube and covered in fabric. In keeping with its intended luxury market, the fully enclosed cabin was insulated and soundproofed, and included wind-down windows. The basic model was priced at $12,000, but numerous options were offered that could nearly double that price; actor Wallace Beery's aircraft cost him $20,000 and was the most expensive Model 6000 built. Operational history=Airline operation= 6000s were operated in 1928 by National Air Transport on their US mail and passenger routes from Chicago to New York, Chicago to Dallas and Chicago to Kansas City.Davies 1998, pp. 73‚Äì74. =Business aircraft= Frame number 6B-2012 was delivered to Harry Ogg of Newton, Iowa on August 20, 1929, who used it as a mobile office and technology demonstrator for his Automatic Washing Machine Company, which eventually morphed into Maytag Corporation. The aircraft was significant in that it included space for a secretary and stenography machine, as well as hook ups for up to 4 washing machines for demonstration purposes. The aircraft was nicknamed \\"Smiling Thru\\" and carried the registration of NC677K.Wings Over Kansas, The Saga of Smiling Thru, Edward Phillips, 18 February 2008 =Foreign service= Two Travel Air 6000 were purchased by the Paraguayan government during the Chaco War (1932-1935) for the Transport Squadron of its Air Arm. These aircraft belonged to TAT with the registrations NC624K (c/n 6B-2011) and NC9815 (c/n 6B-1029); They received the military serials T-2 and T-5 (later re-serialled as T-9). The aircraft were intensively used during the conflict as air ambulances. They both survived the war and continued flying in the Air Arm. In 1945, they were transferred to the first Paraguayan Airline, L√≠neas A√©reas de Transporte Nacional (LATN) and received the civil registrations ZP-SEC and ZP-SED. They were withdrawn from use in 1947. =Movie appearance= A Travel Air 6000 was a \\"star\\" in the Howard Hawks 1939 film Only Angels Have Wings which was a fictional depiction of the early mail service in South America whose early days mirrored the aircraft and issues of US civilian mail service.

Systematic position The first reports on stenogastrine wasps can be found in a book of Gu√©rin de M√©neville (1831) with the first known species, Stenogaster fulgipennis. Henri Louis Fr√©d√©ric de Saussure treated their systematic position and remarked that these wasps were, in all their characters, entirely intermediate between the two subfamilies of Eumeninae and Vespinae. In 1927, Anton von Schulthess-Rechberg created the new genus Parischnogaster for some species living in the Oriental region.A colony of Parischnogaster (belonging to the jacobsoni group) Dutch entomologist Jacobus van der Vecht created four new genera including species from the entire area of distribution and described tens of new species. He revised the two Papuan genera Anischnogaster and Stenogaster and the oriental genus Metischnogaster while the largest genera of the Oriental region, Liostenogaster and Eustenogaster, still wait for revision. He also created one more genus, Holischnogaster, which has been then synonymised by Carpenter (1982) with Parischnogaster. A seventh genus, Cochlischnogaster, described by two Chinese entomologists (Dong and Otsuka), has been more recently included in the subfamily. Carpenter made overviews of the taxonomy and phylogeny of the group which he treated as a subfamily of the family Vespidae, and concluded that the Stenogastrinae, Polistinae, and Vespinae are sister groups and derive from a common ancestor (with no other living offspring). A more complete analysis, published 2010, from the same author including biomolecular data, confirmed this phylogeny. However, some other investigations (from 2007 and 2018) indicate that instead the Polistinae, Vespinae, Masarinae, and Eumeninae all are closer related to each others than to the Stenogastrinae. Morphology and anatomy of the adults The length of the body varies between 10 (some species of Parischnogaster) and 25 mm (some Eustenogaster species). The colour is usually dark brown with brilliant black shades mixed with yellow, white, or yellowish spots. The wings sometimes have iridescent reflexes. Characteristic is the gastrum, the first segment of which is represented by a long petiole blunted in its posterior part. =Head= The shape of the head, viewed from the front, is subtriangular owing to the very long mandibles. The compound eyes are great, and the clypeus is usually quite pointed. The antennae are generally clavated. The mandibles are much more subtle with respect to those of polistine or vespine wasps: in the females they can have three teeth, but in the males of some species, their internal margin is almost straight. Eustenogaster calyptodoma =Mesosoma= The mesosoma (composed of three thoracic segments plus the first abdominal segment, the propodeum) is massive and globular. Legs are short and feeble, while the fore wings are not folded longitudinally as occurs in polistine and vespine wasps. The flight of these wasps is characteristic, and some genera (i.e. Parischnogaster, Metischnogaster and Eustenogaster) can hover in the air, remaining almost immobile like small dragonflies. Females are able to fly close to spider webs to steal small prey; the males perform aerial patrolling during particular times of the day, hovering and protecting particular perching sites. =Metasoma= The metasoma is formed by the abdominal segments minus the first one, which is attached to the last segment of the thorax. The petiole is long as all the other segments together (five in the females and six in the males). This gives these wasps a quite slender silhouette and makes them able to touch the end of the abdomen with the mouth parts when they bend the gastrum ventrally. This is particularly important in egg laying. The last abdominal segments are not externally visible and form the stinging apparatus in the females and the copulatory apparatus in the males. The males possess one more segment than the females and in Parischnogaster, Metischnogaster, and Cochlishnogaster, the dorsal parts (tergites) of some segments are marked with whitish bands which are quite evident when the abdomen is extended. Morphology and anatomy of the immature stages=Egg deposition= Egg-laying in hover wasps is peculiar. In all the species observed of at least three genera, it consists of three stages: after initial inspection of a cell, the female bends her abdomen ventrally towards her mouth parts and collects a patch of viscid abdominal substance which is produced in the Dufour's gland. Then, she may inspect the cell again, retaining all the substance in her mouthparts. After stretching the abdomen, the wasp bends it again, with the sting extruded, towards her mouth and collects the egg as it emerges, allowing its concave surface to adhere to the patch of abdominal secretion. The egg is then placed in the cell and stuck to the bottom by a drop of secretion present on its convex surface. The first patch of abdominal substance is left on the concave surface of the egg. After placing the egg, the wasp bends her abdomen again and collects a larger patch of abdominal secretion that is added to the previous patch on the egg. =Larva= The larval development consists of four stages. Immediately after hatching, the larva curls itself around a mass of gelatinous secretion which covers the eggs produced by the Dufour's gland of the parent. In the very first days, the larvae feed mainly on the liquid food regurgitated by the adults on the secretion mass. Afterwards, cuds of chewed food are inserted by the adults into the secretion mass which is not in itself a food, but rather a substrate which permits the larvae to remain attached to the cell and a \\"dish\\" to collect the supplements of the adults. The more the larva increases in size, the less is the secretion added by the adults, so a fourth-instar larva remains curled in the cell pushing its back against the cell walls. This is another important difference from the other social wasps where the larvae keep their body distended along the longitudinal axis of the cell and present only their heads at the cellular openings. When the adults of the hover wasps nourish their larvae, they touch with their antennae the sides of the larva which opens itself as a kind of sphincter to receive the cud of food. In the other social wasps, instead, the food is supplied by the adults directly into the mouth of the larva. =Pupa= When pupating, the larva spins an incomplete cocoon inside the cell, but the cell itself is closed by the adults with the same kind of material used for the construction of the nest. In some species, however, the opening of the cell is only narrowed and not completely closed. The operculum is then reopened some 2‚Äì3 days afterwards so the adults can eliminate the larval faeces which have been emitted by the larvae after pupation. Once the larval meconium is eliminated, the hole in the operculum is closed again by the adults. The pupa changes its position in the cell with the body along the longitudinal axis and its head towards the operculum with the abdomen bent towards the mouthparts. The development from egg to emergence varies widely according to various species and environmental situations, but knowledge about this is quite limited. The complete larval development lasts a minimum of 43 days on average in Parischnogaster mellyi and a maximum of 105 days on average in Liostenogaster flavolineata. Eustenogaster calyptodoma presents an average larval development around 63 days. The well-formed adult is able to emerge from the cell after the break of the operculum without any help. Colonial cycle and social organization=Nest foundation= In the hover wasps, in most cases, the nest is founded by a solitary fertilized female (foundress), but in some cases may have more than one foundress. Associative nest foundation is reported for some species of Parischnogaster and in Liostenogaster vechti. =Colonial size= In some species, the average number of females per colony registered in a population is less than two as the daughters of the foundress female remain with their mother to help her in foraging and breeding the larvae, but left the colony when they are able to found a nest on their own. The number of adults can vary under the 10 units and rarely goes beyond even counting the individuals of two sexes. On a nest of Liostenogaster topographica were once found 32 individuals. The maximum number of cells ever counted was 110 in a nest of L. flavolineata, while other species can occasionally reach a hundred of cells. =Colonial population dynamics= The development of a society of hover wasps can be extremely long. The egg-laying capacity of one female is quite limited if compared with that of the queen of a colony of other social wasps. The first wasps to emerge from the eggs laid by the foundress are females. Not all the individuals emerged remain in the maternal colony and many of them leave. In theory, a female should remain if she has a good chance to inherit the colony; however, if many others are in line for the same nest and offer a better chance of reproductive success, it may be more convenient to try other reproductive strategies. Young females which have emerged in a colony have various behavioural options. In fact, the colonies of hover wasps do not present rigid castes, and individuals are conditioned in their choices only by the contingent situation of the social environment in which they find themselves. Females are all able to mate, thus are able to lay fertilized (female) eggs and becoming potential new colony foundresses. This course depends on the situation which they find on their natal colony. They can leave the maternal colony to try to found their own colonies; they can remain on the maternal nest waiting to succeed the dominant female when she fails or try to dethrone her; or they can resign themselves to work as workers to rear a certain number of individuals which are genetically related to themselves. Average relatedness coefficient between females found on the same colony have been measured for some species and it is not particularly high. In all the species examined, most of the eggs are produced by only one single mated female. The advantage to be in a group is that helper females have a life insurance-based advantage over lone wasps because if they die, most of the brood they have partly reared will be brought to maturity by surviving nestmates. A strict age-based inheritance queue seems to regulate the access to reproduction in this species: new dominants are the oldest female in their groups in most of the cases. In many nests, some brood could not be assigned to existing adult females. This indicates the high adult mortality rates result in direct advantages to helpers in the form of colony inheritance, and indirect advantages via life insurance. =Male behaviour and mating= The males belonging to species of at least four of the oriental genera (Liostenogaster, Eustenogaster, Parischnogaster, and Metischnogaster) leave the nests and reach well-defined sites where they patrol localized territories of various kinds. Each territory is formed by a number of perches which can be leaves, sticks, and other prominent things of the landscape, usually in a clearing of the forest. L. flavolineata males fly in circuits and land on perches where they rub their gastral tergites, probably releasing a marking pheromone. In Eustenogaster species, males remain motionless on perches, raising their wings and gaster. Parischnogaster and Metischnogaster, instead, hover in flight near the perch, making visible now and then the whitish and shiny bands of their tergal gastra. =Nest= Nest of Eustenogaster fraterna The nest is one of the characters which are common to all social insects and represents an important factor for the origin and evolution of their social life. Stenogastrine nest architecture differs from that of other social wasps and has such an incredible variety of shapes, it has in some instances been used as a systematic character. None of the nests of any stenogastrine species has a petiole (or peduncle), which is one of the more striking differences with respect to the nests of other eusocial wasps. Rather, cells are built directly on various kinds of flat or threadlike substrates. Another important difference is that these wasps use a construction material which is of a poor quality compared to that used by other social wasps. According to Hansell (1996), this is because their mandibles are not suitable for the collection of long vegetable fibres as are those of other vespids. Moreover, the collected material is kept together by a cement (salivary) secretion which is too scarce (and probably not so good) to assure the production of a good paper paste. Hansell maintains this limits the possibility of building large nests and, consequently, the formation of large colonies prevents the development of a more evolved sociality in these wasps. Interspecific variability Interspecific variability in nest architecture is certainly quite high in these wasps, but a considerable variability is also present in some species. Stenogaster: The nest of S. concinna has a bell- shaped architecture, is formed by a low number of cells, and is built with 'soil' containing a few small pieces of vegetable matter. Anischnogaster: The nests of A. iridipennis are built of fine mud with occasional small pieces of stone and vegetable matter incorporated into the structure. In A. laticeps, the nests are actually quite small with an average of three cells and a maximum of eight. Liostenogaster: The nest architecture of this genus presents the largest diversification. Nests can be built entirely with mud or with relevant part of vegetable material. L. flavolineata, L. pardii, L. campanulae, L. varipicta, and L. tutua belong to the first group. The vegetable material nest group includes L. nitidipennis, L. vechti, L. abstrusa, L. topographica, and L. filicis. Clusters of colonies of Liostenogaster vechti Parischnogaster: This genus includes the most common species of hover wasps; their nests can be found on plants, but are quite commonly associated with human buildings. For instance, Parischnogaster mellyi construct their nests under roofs of thatched huts and houses in rural areas.Hansell, M. \\"‚ÄòNest Construction in the Subsocial Wasp Parischnogaster mellyi (Saussure) Stenogastrinae (Hymenoptera)‚Äô\\".Insectes Sociaux 28(2): 208‚Äì216. Architectural form varies from cells scattered along substrata to more elaborated structures with cells opening in common tubes. This genus also uses mimicry to keep nests well hidden from predators. P. striatula is able to match the outer texture of the nest to its surroundings, by making it rough or smooth. Eustenogaster: These relatively large and robust hover wasps present a distinctive nest structure with the central part of the nest formed by a comb of a bunch (usually 8-20) of cells. The external walls of the peripheral cells are extended downwards to form a narrow spout at least as long as the cells and acting as an envelope. Nest of Eustenogaster micans Metischnogaster: The genus includes two species with the most highly camouflaged nests imaginable consisting of a row of cells, the first of which is attached with its bottom to the tip of a thread-like suspension. The second cell is attached to the lower end of the first, the third to that of the second and so on. A special conical structure is built above the line of cells acting as a ‚Äúdrop stopper‚Äù. Cochlischnogaster: No information is at present available for the nest architecture of any species of this genus. The evolution of the nest architecture in these wasps has been especially determined by the pressure exerted by predators such as ants and tropical hornets. Against the first ones, some species build special sticky, gelatinous structures, called ‚Äúant guards‚Äù, formed with the secretion of the Dufour gland which are placed as barriers to the nests. Nest camouflage, instead, is the first determinant of the defence against the attacks of hornets. Another defence system used by some species is to form dense clusters of nests in sites seldom practiced by the above predators. ReferencesFurther reading * *Kojima, J. (1990).

Roosevelt is located along Interstate 10 at its midpoint in Texas, approximately 438 miles from both the New Mexico and Louisiana border. History The establishment of Roosevelt happened when Alice C.E. Wagoner was appointed postmistress and a post office was established on August 22, 1898. Wagoner applied for the community as a different name, but the United States Postal Service named the town Roosevelt. It is presumed that the postal service chose the name for Theodore Roosevelt, who had made headlines the month before on July 1, 1898 with his charge up San Juan Hill with the Rough Riders. Roosevelt's 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, known as the Rough Riders, was organized and trained at San Antonio on May 9‚Äì19, 1898. Roosevelt was a shipping point for feed and grain for local sheep and goat farmers. Horses were bred in Roosevelt for the United States Cavalry, and also for the national polo market.

She has been a pioneering creator of film, video, and installation art since the early 1990s. She lives and works in Los Angeles, California.  Education  Thater studied Art History at New York University and earned her BA in 1984. In 1990 she was awarded an MFA from Art Center College of Design.  Work  Thater's work explores the temporal qualities of video and film while literally expanding it into space. She is best known for her site-specific installations in which she manipulates architectural space through forced interaction with projected images and tinted light, such as knots + surfaces (2001) and Delphine (1999) in the Kulturkirche St. Stephani (2009) and the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart (2010). Thater's primary interest lies in exploring the relationship between humans and the natural world and the distinctions between untouched and manipulated nature. Despite nods to structural film, Thater's underlying reference points are closer to panoramic landscape painting.Liz Kotz in Zoya Kocur, Simon Leung, Theory in Contemporary Art Since 1985, Blackwell Publishing, 2005, p104. Thater's stated belief is that film and video are not by definition narrative media, and that abstraction can, and does exist in representational moving images. = Delphine = Delphine is one of Thater's most well-known works and was exhibited not only within the United States but also in several different locations around the world, including France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The Delphine exhibition consists of the simultaneous projection of multiple footages of underwater and dolphins. The footages are projected on various surfaces, not just the walls, to create an enveloping and engaging space for the viewers. Thater also placed the projectors in a way that the viewer's silhouette created due to the projector light can physically be part of the work and interact with the subjects within her footages. Unlike some films or videos dealing with animals, Thater's Delphine does not include narration. Thater left out narrations and avoided inserting specific narrative because she believes that animals do not live their lives narratively. Thater wanted to show the animals as they are without enforcing human perspective on them. = Science, Fiction = Exhibited in 2015, Thater's Science, Fiction is a video installation that is divided into two parts. The two parts are placed in separate rooms, but both rooms have blue hue due to the light beams attached on the floor corners. The first part consists of two monitors, facing each other, showcasing footages of planetarium from Griffith Observatory, which is located in Los Angeles. The second part consists of huge box, size of a small room, that has a projection of dung beetles above it and intense yellow light under it. The purpose behind this exhibition was to visually show the recent scientific discovery that dung beetles use starlight during night time to navigate themselves. Through her exhibition, Thater commented on impact of light pollution on wildlife. = Chernobyl = First exhibited in 2011, Thater's Chernobyl showcases multiple footages recorded in Prypiat in Chernobyl. The exhibition consists of simultaneous display of multiple footages of different locations in Prypiat. The center of the exhibition is the footage of a movie theater and all four sides of the movie theater are projected on the gallery space. Over the projection of the movie theater, the other footages, such as buildings, animals and nature, are projected as well. This exhibition is not only about showing negative human impact on nature, but to also show how life still persists even under such condition.  Exhibitions  Since her first solo show in 1991, Thater has exhibited widely throughout North America and Europe, with one-person exhibitions at the Institute of Modern Art in Brisbane (2011), the Santa Monica Museum of Art (2010),Diana Thater: Between Science and Magic at the Santa Monica Museum of Art Kunsthaus Graz in collaboration with London's Natural History Museum (2009), Dia Center for the Arts (2001), Vienna Secession (2000), The Museum of Modern Art (1998),moma.org MAK Center for Art and Architecture in Los Angeles (1998), the Walker Art Center (1997), the Kunsthalle Basel (1996), Salzburger Kunstverein (1996), The Renaissance Society (1995), and the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art (1994), among many others. In March 2004, the Museum f√ºr Gegenwartskunst Siegen and the Kunsthalle Bremen in Germany opened a simultaneous two-museum survey exhibition of her work from 1993 to 2003. Her numerous group exhibitions include the Whitney Biennial (2006, 1997, 1995) and the Carnegie International (1999). Since 2000, Thater has been the artist-in- residence for The Dolphin Project, a non-profit organization that protects cetaceans from slaughter, captivity, and abuse. In 2009, Diana Thater taught art at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. The artist is represented by David Zwirner, New York. Awards In 2011, Thater received an Award for Artistic Innovation from the Center for Cultural Innovation in Los Angeles.Center for Cultural Innovation Press Release She used the grant to complete Chernobyl, a large-scale installation project which documents the post-human landscape at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant site in the Ukraine, marking the 25th anniversary of the explosion in 2011.Diana Thater - Center for Cultural Innovation She has been the recipient of other notable awards, including the Phelan Award in Film and Video (2006), a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2005),gf.org an √âtant-donn√©s Foundation Grant (1996), and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1993).

He supervised the pratishtha consecration ceremony of many‚Äîperhaps most‚Äîof the Jain idols carved on the hill side in the Gwalior Fort during the rule of Tomara rulers Dungarasimha and Kirtisimha.  Biography  Raidhu was born in the Padmavati Purval Jain community,Padmavati Purval Digambar Jain Jati ka Udbhav aur Vikas, Ramjit Jain, Pragatishil Padmavati Purval Digambar Jain Sangathan Panjikrut, 2005, p. 77-79 as he himself acknowledged. His birth place is uncertain, but he appears to have spent most of his life in or around Gwalior. He was a lay disciple of the Jain leader Bramha Shripal, who was a disciple of Bhattaraka Yashahkiriti of Kashtha Sangha. Raidhu was an important figure in the Gwalior court, where he stayed at the invitation of the Tomara king Dungarasimha. He was also a close associate of the Digambara ascetics (Bhattarakas) who were influential in the Tomara court. Besides, Raidhu was patronized by several wealthy Jain merchants. Raidhu played a central role in connecting these different groups together: he authored religious books for the wealthy merchants, and encouraged them to donate money towards religious causes. Raidhu's powerful and wealthy sponsors helped disseminate his literary works, some of which are lavishly illustrated (e.g. Jasodharacariu). These patrons included Kamalasimha, Yashahkirti, Khelha Brahmachari, Sanghadhipati Nemadasa and Asapati. Kamalasimha started the development of Gwalior as a Jain holy place, with support from the Tomara rulers Dungarasimha and Kirtisimha. The Digambara monk Yashahkirti and Khelha Brahmachari encouraged Raidhu to write Sammaiji·πáacariu, a biography of Mahavira. Khelha also commissioned the colossal image of Chandraprabha. Sanghadhipati Nemadasa was a patron of Raidhu's poem Pu·πá·πáƒÅsavakahƒÅkosa, and also built a Jain shrine on his recommendation. Asapati was a minister of the Tomara king Dungarasimha.  Jain images  Raidhu was also responsible for consecrating many of the Jain rock carvings inside the fort, as attested by multiple inscriptions. These include the two colossal images of Adinatha (57 feet) and Chandraprabha. Medieval Jain texts state that certain sacred mountains covered with images of Jinas would survive the destruction of the world. Raidhu's poems often mention the end times, and several near-contemporary poets also allude to the end times amid the Muslim conquests. Therefore, it appears that the colossal Jain images were intended to ensure the survival of Gopalagiri (the Gwalior fort hill) in the end times.  Literary works  Raidhu composed several poems in Apabhramsha, many of which have survived. He composed many of these poems while living in the Jain temples of Gopalagiri. Raja Ram Jain translated Raidhu's poems into Hindi language. Raidhu's known works include:Jain Dharma Ka Prachin Itishas, Paramanand Shastri, Gajendra Publication, 1975 * Anathmi Kaha * Appa Samboha Kavva (\\"Addressing myself\\") * Balahadda Chariu, written at the request of Agrawal Sahu Harsi. * BhadrabƒÅhucariu ** An account of Bhadrabahu * Dashalakshana Jayamala * Dhanakumar Chariu * Jasodhara-Chariu * Jivandhar Chariu * Mesehar Chariu * Pu·πá·πáƒÅsavakahƒÅkosa (Punnasava-kahakosa) ** Composed at the request of Sanghadhipati Nemadasa * Ritthanemi Chariu * Sammaiji·πáacariu or Sammai Jinachariu ** A biography of Mahavira, written on the request of Khelha Brahmachari, the son of Agrawal Sahu Tosau of Hisar.

A model is designated as the \\"best\\" of the candidate models if it gives the best value of an objective function measuring the degree of satisfaction of the criterion used to evaluate the alternative hypotheses. The term has been used to identify the different criteria that are used to evaluate a phylogenetic tree. For example, in order to determine the best topology between two phylogenetic trees using the maximum likelihood optimality criterion, one would calculate the maximum likelihood score of each tree and choose the one that had the better score. However, different optimality criteria can select different hypotheses. In such circumstances caution should be exercised when making strong conclusions.

Background He was born on September 5, 1936 in Montreal to working-class family with English speaking father of Irish Quebecer descent and a francophone mother. His father delivered bread for a living and died when Robert was two. Burns trained as a labour lawyer at the University of Montreal on a scholarship and became a legal advisor to the Conf√©d√©ration des syndicats nationaux (CSN) trade union. Politically, he was active in the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party. Initially a federalist, Burns became a nationalist as a result of his experiences representing francophone workers against English bosses and was persuaded to stand as a Parti Qu√©b√©cois candidate in 1970. Member of the legislature Burns won a seat to the National Assembly of Quebec in 1970 in the district of Maisonneuve having defeated former Rassemblement pour l'ind√©pendance nationale leader Marcel Chaput for the Parti Qu√©b√©cois's nomination. He was one of seven P√©quistes to win a seat in the National Assembly, the first contested by the new party. He was re-elected in 1973 and 1976. Burns was the informal leader of the left-wing faction of the PQ and often clashed with the more moderate PQ leader Ren√© L√©vesque, particularly over labour disputes, and criticised Levesque's position during the La Presse strike in 1971 with such vigour that when he left a meeting with Levesque, he slammed the door and shattered its glass pane. He was passed over by L√©vesque after the 1973 election, when Jacques-Yvan Morin was appointed Leader of the Opposition instead of Burns, after L√©vesque failed to win a seat in the election. Burns served as his party's House Leader from 1970 until 1978 when he was replaced by Claude Charron after suffering a heart attack. His relationship with his party was at times uneasy. In 1979, he told reporters ‚ÄúI am a socialist and the Parti Qu√©b√©cois is not always socialist.\\" Cabinet Member In 1977, Burns was appointed to Premier Ren√© L√©vesque's Cabinet and became a key architect of the government's drive for Quebec independence. He served as Minister responsible for Electoral Reform and introduced the province's law banning corporate and union donations to political parties and limiting donations to $100 per person and also wrote Quebec's referendum law that funded both sides equally and required each side to have umbrella committees that included all proponents. Burns was also instrumental in Quebec's introduction of anti-scab legislation that banned companies from hiring strikebreakers during strikes. Burns also issued a white paper favouring proportional representation but the idea was not popular with his colleagues. His health weakened, Burns resigned his seat and retired from politics in 1979 and was appointed a labour court judge in 1980, Burns again clashed with L√©vesque, predicting the government's defeat in the 1980 sovereignty referendum and in the subsequent election. Later years and death Burns remained on the Labour Court for two decades, retiring in 2001. During the 2012 Quebec student protests he urged Premier Jean Charest to negotiate with students demanding a tuition freeze. He also commented on the Charbonneau Commission inquiry into corruption saying he was \\"disgusted\\" by allegations that construction and engineering companies flouted his electoral financing law by making illegal donations to political parties.

Choosing a low carbon diet is one facet of developing sustainable diets which increase the long-term sustainability of humanity. It is estimated that the U.S. food system is responsible for at least 20 percent of U.S. greenhouse gases.20% of GHGe from food industry This estimate may be low, as it counts only direct sources of GHGe. Indirect sources, such as demand for products from other countries, are often not counted. A low-carbon diet minimizes the emissions released from the production, packaging, processing, transport, preparation and waste of food. Major tenets of a low-carbon diet include eating less industrial meat and dairy, eating less industrially produced food in general, eating food grown locally and seasonally, eating less processed and packaged foods and reducing waste from food by proper portion size, recycling or composting.  Overall trends  A 2014 study into the real-life diets of British people estimated their greenhouse gas footprints in terms of kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per day: * 7.19 for high meat-eaters (‚â•100 g/day) * 5.63 for medium meat-eaters (50‚Äì99 g/day) * 4.67 for low meat-eaters (<50 g/day) * 3.91 for fish-eaters * 3.81 for vegetarians * 2.89 for vegans  Background on diet and greenhouse gas emissions  In the U.S., the food system emits four of the greenhouse gases associated with climate change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons.STAT saying that those four are emitted The burning of fossil fuels (such as oil and gasoline) to power vehicles that transport food for long distances by air, ship, truck and rail releases carbon dioxide (CO2), the primary gas responsible for global warming. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are emitted from mechanical refrigerating and freezing mechanisms ‚Äì both staples in food shipment and storage.CFC STAT Anthropogenic methane emission sources include agriculture (ruminants, manure management, wetland rice production), various other industries and landfills. Anthropogenic nitrous oxide sources include fertilizer, manure, crop residues and nitrogen-fixing crops production.EPA. 2011. Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks: 1990-2009. United States Environmental Protection Agency. EPA 430-R-11-005. 459 pp. Methane and nitrous oxide are also emitted in large amounts from natural sources. The 100-year global warming potentials of methane and nitrous oxide are recently estimated at 25 and 298 carbon dioxide equivalents, respectively.IPCC. 2007. Fourth Assessment Report. The Scientific Basis. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sec. 2.10.2. Steinfeld et al. estimate that livestock production accounts for 18 percent of anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents.Steinfeld, H. et al. 2006, Livestock‚Äôs Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options. Livestock, Environment and Development, FAO. Of this amount, 34 percent is carbon dioxide emission from deforestation, principally in Central and South America, that they assigned to livestock production. However, deforestation associated with livestock production is not an issue in many regions. In the US, the land area occupied by forest increased between 1990 and 2009US EPA. 2011. Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks: 1990-2009. United States Environmental Protection Agency. EPA 430-R-11-005. 459 pp. and a net increase in forest land area was also reported in Canada.Environment Canada. 2010. National Inventory Report 1990-2008. Greenhouse Gas Sources and Sinks in Canada. Part 1. 221 pp. Of emissions they attribute to livestock production, Steinfeld et al. estimate that globally, methane accounts for 30.2 percent. Like other greenhouse gases, methane contributes to global warming when its atmospheric concentration rises. Although methane emission from agriculture and other anthropogenic sources has contributed substantially to past warming, it is of much less significance for current and recent warming. This is because there has been relatively little increase in atmospheric methane concentration in recent years IPCC. 2007. Fourth Assessment Report. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The anomalous increase in methane concentration in 2007, discussed by Rigby et al., has since been attributed principally to anomalous methane flux from natural wetlands, mostly in the tropics, rather than to anthropogenic sources. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents. A 2016 study published in Nature Climate Change concludes that climate taxes on meat and milk would simultaneously produce substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and lead to healthier diets. Such taxes would need to be designed with care: exempting and subsidising some food groups, selectively compensating for income loss, and using part of the revenue for health promotion. The study analyzed surcharges of 40% on beef and 20% on milk and their effects on consumption, climate emissions, and distribution. An optimum plan would reduce emissions by 1billion tonnes per year ‚Äì similar in amount to those from aviation globally.  High-carbon and low-carbon food choices  Greenhouse impact across food categories: results from a 2017 review of 389 Life-cycle assessments Take a Bite Out Of Climate Change flashcards Certain foods require more fossil fuel inputs than others, making it possible to go on a low-carbon diet and reduce one‚Äôs carbon footprint by choosing foods that need less fossil fuel and therefore emit less carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In June 2010, a report from United Nations Environment Programme declared that a global shift towards a vegan diet was needed to save the world from hunger, fuel shortages and climate change.Felicity Carus UN urges global move to meat and dairy-free diet, The Guardian, 2 June 2010 * Also see \\"Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production\\", United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Brussels, 2 June 2010. Cundiff and Harris write: \\"The American Dietetic Association (ADA) and Dietitians of Canada position paper officially recognizes that well-planned vegan and other vegetarian diets are appropriate for infancy and childhood.\\" China introduced new dietary guidelines in 2016 which aim to cut meat consumption by 50% and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1billion tonnes by 2030.  Industrial versus pastured livestock  Beef and dairy cattle can be particularly high in their levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Feed is a significant contributor to emissions from animals raised in Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) or factory farms, as corn or soy beans must be fertilised, irrigated, processed into animal feed, packaged and then transported to the CAFO. In 2005, CAFOs accounted for 74% of the world's poultry production, 50% of pork, 43% of beef, and 68% of eggs, according to the Worldwatch Institute. Proportions are significantly higher in developed countries, but are growing rapidly in developing countries, where demand is also growing fast.Danielle Nierenberg, Lisa Mastny, 2005, Worldwatch Paper #171: Happier Meals: Rethinking the Global Meat Industry, p. 11-12 However, in the US, only about 11 percent of soybean acres and 14 percent of corn acres are irrigated; in contrast, about 66 percent of vegetable acres and 79 percent of orchard acres are irrigated.USDA. 2009. 2007 Census of agriculture. United States summary and State Data. Vol. 1. Geographic Area Series. Part 51. AC-07-A-51. 639 pp. + appendices.USDA. 2009. 2007 Census of agriculture. Farm and ranch irrigation survey (2008). Volume 3. Special Studies. Part 1. AC-07-SS-1. 177 pp. + appendices. In 1995, commercial fertilizer inputs averaged 11 pounds per acre for US soybean production, versus 157 pounds per acre for US potato production.Anderson, M. and R. Magleby. 1997. Agricultural resources and environmental indicators, 1996-1997. USDA Ag. Handbook AH712. 356 pp. Soybean meal for livestock feed is commonly produced after extraction of soybean oil (used for cooking, food products, biodiesel, etc.,Soyatech: http://soyatech.com/soy_facts.htm USDA. 2011. Agricultural Statistics 2010. 505 pp. so that only a fraction of processing is assignable to feed. Such examples illustrate that issues relating to irrigation, fertilization and processing for meat production should also be of concern with regard to production of other foods. In one study, grass-fed cattle were estimated to account for 40% less greenhouse emissions than CAFO cattleBrian Halweil and Danielle Nierenberg, 2008, Meat and Seafood: The Global Diet‚Äôs Most Costly Ingredients, in The Worldwatch Institute's State of the World 2008, p. 65 However, comparative effects on emissions can vary. in a US study, lower GHG emissions were associated with feedlot-finished beef production than with beef production on pasture and hay. Similarly, a study in New Zealand concluded that environmental emissions per kilogram of beef produced can be reduced by incorporating feedlot finishing in a beef production system. Another factor to be considered is the role of a healthy pastoral ecosystem in carbon sequestration. Rotational grazing of ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, etc.) and birds (chickens, turkeys, etc.) on untilled pasture land promotes rapid topsoil accumulation, representing a major carbon sink. Because CAFO production is highly centralised, the transport of animals to slaughter and then to distant retail outlets is a further source of greenhouse gas emissions. However, this can be more or less compensated by reduced transport of feed, where CAFOs are located in feed-producing areas. In livestock production, emissions are reduced by feeding human-inedible materials that might otherwise by wasted. Elferink et al. state that \\"Currently, 70 % of the feedstock used in the Dutch feed industry originates from the food processing industry.\\"Elferink, E. V., S. Nonhebel and H. C. Moll. 2008. Feeding livestock food residue and the consequences for the environmental impact of meat. J. Cleaner Prod. 16: 1227-1233 Among several US examples is the feeding of distillers grains remaining from biofuel production. For the marketing year 2009/2010, the amount of dried distillers grains used as livestock feed (and residual) in the US amounted to 25.0 million tonnes.Hoffman, L. and A. Baker. 2010. Market issues and prospects for U.S. distillers' grains supply, use, and price relationships. USDA FDS-10k-01).  Distance traveled and method of transit  Carbon emissions from transport account for 11% of the total carbon emissions of food, of which the transportation from producer to consumer accounts for 4%. However, \\"food miles\\" are a very misleading measure; in many cases food imported from the other side of the world may have a lower carbon footprint than a locally produced equivalent, due to differences in farming methods; \\"local food\\" campaigns may be motivated by protectionism rather than genuine environmentalism. When looking at total greenhouse gases (not just carbon dioxide), 83% of emissions come from the actual production of the food because of the methane released by livestock and the nitrous oxide due to fertilizer. The word locavore describes a person attempting to eat a diet consisting of foods harvested from within a 100-mile radius. Some studies have criticized the emphasis on local food, claiming that it romanticizes local production, but does not produce very much environmental benefit. Transportation accounts for a relatively small portion of overall energy consumption in food production, and locally produced food may be much more energy intensive than food produced in a better area. Additionally the emphasis on \\"inefficient\\" local producers over more efficient ones further away may be damaging.  Processing, packaging and waste  Highly processed foods such as granola bars come in individual packaging, demanding high energy inputs and resulting in packaging waste. These products contribute up to a third of total energy inputs for food consumption, as their ingredients are shipped from all over, processed, packaged, trucked to storage, then transported to retail outlets. Bottled water is another example of a highly packaged, wasteful food product. It is estimated that Americans throw away 40 million plastic water bottles every day, and bottled water is often shipped trans-continentally. Carbonated water must be chilled and kept under pressure during storage and transport so as to keep the carbon dioxide dissolved. This factor contributes greater energy usage for products shipped longer distances.

History The Soldier's Monument Association formed in Aurora in 1869 with the intent of raising funds to construct a monument to veterans of the U.S. Civil War. The group was very successful, and secretary Fred O. White proposed that a building should be erected in honor of the soldiers instead. White was inspired by a recent visit to Memorial Hall in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and noted that that structure was a useful meeting place and library. The Aurora building was intended to be almost identical to the Foxborough building, though the builders decided not to replicate the granite roof and stained glass. Joseph Mulvey was hired to design the building; no other Mulvey- designed structures have yet been identified. The building was constructed on Stolp Island, a small piece of land considered to be \\"neutral territory\\" between the east and west sides of Aurora. Stolp Island was a popular spot for public buildings due to increasingly strained relations between the two sides of the river. The GAR Hall was the only public library in Aurora until a Carnegie library opened across the street in 1903. The hall was the meeting place of the Aurora G.A.R. Post No. 20, which was one of 779 posts in the Department of Illinois.Library of Congress list of GAR posts by state Any honorably discharged Union veteran of the war could join the group. The group was formally recognized until the death of its last member, Daniel Augustus Wedge, in 1947. The Grand Army of the Republic Hall was slated for demolition in the 1960s. Public outcry forced the city to change its plans, and a 1963 fundraising campaign provided financial support to rehabilitate the building. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and was part of the Stolp Island Historic District when it was separately listed in 1986. Renovations were partially completed in 2016, and the hall was opened to the public as \\"The Grand Army of the Republic Memorial Museum.\\" The G.A.R. Memorial Museum is open every Saturday afternoon, Noon to 4 p.m. The octagonally-shaped building was built with locally quarried limestone. The standing Gothic Revival structure is one and a half stories and features a small lot outside of the building with an 1851 cannon, a bench, and a flagpole. An addition was constructed in 1884 on the south wing, but was demolished during the 1963 restoration.

Geography Gwaldam is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Gwaldam It has an average elevation of 1,940 metres (6,364 feet). It is 20 km far from Baijnath, capital of medieval Katyuri kings and 25 km far from Kulsari the famous camp station of Nanda Devi Raj Jat. Gwaldam is a small town itself, the main reason for its prosperity is its being a junction of Kumaon and Garhwal and many paths lead to different areas and villages. It is also a base camp for the trekkers who enter from Kathgodam (Nainital) railhead on trekking route to Lord Curzon Trail (Kuari Pass), Nanda Devi Raj Jat and Roopkund. Once it was a mandi for potato and apple trade. There are a number of picnic and devotional spots in the area like Badhangari, Gwaldam naag, Angyari mahadev, Machchi taal, Buddha temple, river sites of Pindar, and a wildlife rich area along the Roopkund road. The main village of Atal Adarsh Gram Gwaldam is talla Gwaldam which is situated 2 kilometer from Gwaldam market, known for its ancient Dak-khana (post office) and Chaykhana (tea factory). The Britisher Curzon built a track connecting Gwaldam to Roopkund which passes through the various places like Devtaal, Nandkeshri, Deval, Mundoli and Waana Gaon. Talla Gwaldam people have a strong belief on Goddess bhagwati for which devotee comes for worship from all around during bhado (bhadrpad). Here one suspicious box placed near the village is still the center of attraction which is placed here since British period. History Historically, Gwaldam is a part of Garhwal hills and situated at the borderline between Garhwal and Kumaon. A number of battles were fought here in past. It being on a strategic point it remained an apple of discord between the Garhwal and Kumaon kings. Gwaldam is situated at the saddle of Gwaldam- Shisakhani ridge and Gwaldam-Badhangarhi ridge. Border could be crossed through Gwaldam only. South of these ridges is Kumaon and north is Garhwal. Later Katyuri kings, who hailed from Joshimath, and had sympathy for King of Garhwal because of lineage. King of Badhangarhi was under king of Garhwal and had not in good term with King of Kumaon but had good relation with Katyuri king because of neighborhoods. All these led to a situation between Kumaon and Garhwal kings. In order to browbeat king of Badhangarhi in last decade of 16th century, Chand king sent Parkhu, a great warrior to fight with king of Badhangarhi. Unfortunately, line of supply was cut short by the Katyuri king and Parkhu was beheaded at Binayakdhar, perhaps nearby crossroad at Gwaldam. King of Garhwal rewarded the soldier who brought the head to Shrinagar. This infuriated the Chand King, Rudra Chand and he personally led the troops and captured the Katyuri king and later killed the Katyuri king Sukhal Deo and exiled his family. Atkinson, in his work, \\"The Himalayan Gazetteer\\", narrated these episodes. Because of strategic importance a base camp of ITBP was established in 1960s and SSB training center was established in 1970s which was meant for some secret military operation. Locally, then it was known as secret service bureau. SSB imparted guerilla warfare training. In Uttarakhand a number of SSB guerilla trained persons are still ready to serve for any cause. At present a small unit of SSB is present at Gwaldam that runs occasional training courses. Major activities are shifted some elsewhere. Training grounds, sports fields, stadium, helipads and other infra-structure facility are still here. Local people expect that this large chunk of land, about 10 square kilometer could be used as adventure sports university or other activity. A hydro-electric power project of 252 MW is under construction. Head of this project is at Nandkesari on the river Pindar, a tributary of Holy river Ganga. The women-centric Maiti movement, which involves a unique ritual of planting a sapling by a newly-wedded couple, was initiated in Gwaldam by environmentalist Kalyan Singh Rawat in 1994. It is a program intended to develop eco-awareness among the people. Central School, Government Inter College, Girls Junior high School, Vidya-Mandir, Shishu- Mandir and other study, coaching centers are here. Krishi-Vigyan Kendra, Animal Husbandry, Veterinary Center, Fruit Processing Center, Forest Rest House, GMVN Tourist Rest House, State Bank, Chamoli District Cooperative bank branch, are also available here. For basic health care a government allopathic hospital is also available here. Presently under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, schemes like strengthening of Angora breeding farm and pilot project for establishment of Barbara goat are sanctioned. Government Degree College Talwari is situated at a distance of 11 km from here. Previously it was a private degree college founded by a freedom fighter, politician, educationist and member of legislative assembly in erstwhile Uttar Pradesh, Sher Singh Danu. A State Bank of India ATM is located in the main market. The nearest railway station is at KATHGODAM, 180 km. away from here and nearest airport is at Gauchar at 78 km. distance from here. Airport is yet not functional. Several hotels and Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam guesthouses are available. Among the legacies of British Raj the Barudghar (explosive store house), Dakkhana (post office), Chaykhana (Tea Factory), Janglat Dak Bungalow (Forest Rest House) only FRH survives with its heritage building. A lake, 'Nirmal Sarovar' (named after a great Forester NK Joshi), in FRH campus is a point of attraction here. Civil Society Gwaldam and NEEDS are social welfare associations that are active here.

The group formed around leader Frank Virtue (January 21, 1923 ‚Äì June 11, 1994), who played the violin as a child and took up the guitar and the double bass as a teenager. He continued with the latter as a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra and studied orchestration at Temple University. He enlisted in the Navy in 1945 and became bandleader of the Regular Navy Dance Band in Bainbridge, Maryland. He was discharged in 1946 because his father, who had been diagnosed with cancer, could no longer support his family.[ The Virtues], AllMusic Virtue considered putting together a big band but, due to financial constraints, assembled an amplified trio instead, with Ralph Frederico on the piano and Steve Rossi on the guitar. Virtue named the band the Virtuoso Trio after their formation in 1947. The Virtuoso Trio toured the regional club circuit for the better part of a decade, playing as far as Canada and making regular appearances on Philadelphia radio and television. They performed as a backup ensemble for Patti Page, Rosemary Clooney, Dick Haymes, June Christy, and others. When local Pennsylvanians Bill Haley & the Comets hit big in the mid-1950s, Virtue found a receptive audience in the teenagers who loved the nascent rock and roll craze. By this time, the group's lineup had expanded, with Virtue on the bass, John Renner on the saxophone, Jimmy Bruno on guitar, Joe Vespe on drums, and Dave Kaplin as an occasional vocalist. Under the name the Virtues, they released a rock reworking of Arthur \\"Guitar Boogie\\" Smith's country hit \\"Guitar Boogie\\" in 1958 under the title \\"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\\", on the Hunt label. The instrumental became a major hit in the U.S., peaking at #27 on the Black Singles chart and #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959.[ Billboard Singles], Allmusic The single also became a sheet music smash, selling well worldwide. Several singles followed ‚Äì \\"Flippin\\", \\"Boogie Woogie\\", \\"Vaya con Dios\\" ‚Äì but none of them succeeded; the group was signed by ABC-Paramount, but their only return to the charts was with the 1962 release \\"Guitar Boogie Shuffle Twist\\" (U.S. #95). Towards the end of 1962, Virtue disbanded the group and pursued a career as a record producer and recording engineer. His studio, Virtue Recording Studios, located at 1618 N.

He was the original cutter of the typefaces now known as Bell, Scotch Roman, and Porson. Born in London 4 August 1756 and christened at St Luke's Old Street, he studied seal, die and copper-plate engraving as an apprentice to John Phillips near Finsbury Square. He married Phillips' daughter Sarah and set up on his own about 1786. He was hired by John Bell's British Letter Foundry in 1788 as a punch-cutter, to imitate Didot's 1782 types \\"de la troisi√®me mani√®re,\\" cut by Pierre Vafflard to F-A Didot's designs. Bell sold his interest in the foundry to S & C Stephenson. When the foundry closed in 1797, Austin brought in his own punches and sold strikes to Fry & Steele, Figgins, and Caslon. Strikes were even sold in North America. Austin cut Greek types for Cambridge University Press in 1806-8, following designs provided by the famous master Richard Porson. He probably also cut the Sarcophagus Greek that preceded it. Austin then provided strikes to William Miller's foundry in Edinburgh & Alexander Wilson's Sons' foundry in Glasgow, creating the types now known as Scotch, before founding his own Imperial Letter Foundry in London in 1815, with his son George (who had been his apprentice until 1805). The first Miller Specimen of 1809 is now lost (The University of Vermont holds the 1811 Specimen). Wilson's earliest specimen showing the improved types is dated 1812. Richard Austin died circa 20 August 1832, leaving the foundry to his son George, whom many credited with the innovations in type designs manifest in the Scotch types. Austin's other sons were John Phillips Austin, a music engraver, and Richard Turner Austin (1781-1842), a painter (member of the Royal Academy) and commercial wood engraver.

The family were active in the Congregational Church, and through a church connection he joined Houlder Brothers & Co., a firm that provided ships for migration to New Zealand and Australia. Early career In 1860, J.T. Arundel travelled on a Houlder Brothers & Co ship into the Pacific, calling at the Chincha Islands, on which guano was mined for refining into superphosphate. J.T. Arundel took an interest in the potential of the fertiliser business and in 1868 the company sent him on a second voyage into the Pacific to pursue opportunities. When J.T. Arundel set off in 1871 to develop a business in the Pacific he left his fianc√©e Eliza Eleanor (Lillie) Whibley in England, as he wanted to secure their financial security by achieving success with his business ventures. J .T. Arundel and Lillie Whibley were not to marry until 1881. Following their marriage Lillie Arundel would travel into the central Pacific with J.T. Arundel when he would visit the various islands on which his company had operations. Lillie Arundel gave birth in 1884 to their second daughter while on Manra, then known as Sydney Island, giving her the name of that island. In 1898 Fred Whibley, Lillie's younger brother, arrived in Sydney, after 10 years in the United States and Canada. J .T. Arundel offered Fred Whibley a position with John T. Arundel & Co. Fred Whibley declined and chose to become an island trader on Niutao in what is now Tuvalu. A harmonious working relationship would have been unlikely given the pious Christian attitudes of J.T. Arundel and Fred Whibley's reputation as the 'black sheep' of the family.S. Aris, Fred Whibley and his Family (1963) John T. Arundel & Co. In 1871 with financial support from Houlder Brothers and Co., he established John T. Arundel & Co. The initial activities were carried out by the two companies. Houlder Brothers and Co leased Flint Island from the British government and Arundel managed the guano digging in the central part of the island from 1875 to 1880. In 1872, Caroline Island was leased by the Houlder Brothers. In 1881, the lease was later taken over by Arundel (for whom one of the islets is named). John T. Arundel & Co went on to engage in mining guano on other Pacific islands and also established coconut plantations and traded in copra and other commodities. The company operated from Sydney, Australia with business interests in the Pacific that included: * Mining guano on: ** Caroline Island from 1872 (with the support of Houlder Brothers and Co) then under John T. Arundel & Co from 1881. The guano mining, which began in 1874, supplied a total of about 10,000 tons of phosphate until supplies were exhausted around 1895. ** Baker Island from 1886 to 1899, which is now claimed as an unincorporated territory of the United States. ** Howland Island from 1886 to 1899, which is geographically part of the Phoenix Islands and now claimed as an unincorporated territory of the United States. ** Jarvis Island from 1886 to 1899, which is geographically part of the Line Islands and now claimed as an unincorporated territory of the United States. ** Manra or Sydney Island in 1884, which is geographically part of the Phoenix Islands and is part of Kiribati. ** Raine Island in the Torres Strait, Rocky Island, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Lady Elliot Island off Bundaberg, Queensland and several islands in the Capricorn and Bunker Group in the waters off Northern Australia. * Establishing coconut plantations on: ** Flint Island in 1881 in what is now Kiribati, with the plantation operated by the firm until 1891. ** Caroline Island in 1885, however the coconut palms suffered from disease and the plantation failed. ** Nikumaroro, or Gardner Island, which is geographically part of the Phoenix Islands and is part of Kiribati. The plantation was started in 1892 but as a consequence of severe drought the plantation was abandoned within 12 months.Bryan, E.H. Jr., (1942) American Polynesia and the Hawaiian Chain. Honolulu, Hawaii: Tongg Publishing Company Albert Ellis who worked for John T. Arundel & Co., later acknowledged that the company was not making money although the company was gaining experience in the mining and shipping of guano and phosphate rock in what were sometimes difficult conditions, with many of these islands having no safe anchorage for shipping.  Pacific Islands Company Ltd  In 1897 John T. Arundel & Co., merged its business with that of the trading and plantation firm of Henderson and Macfarlane to form the Pacific Islands Company Ltd ('PIC'). The company was based in London with its trading activities in the Pacific. The Chairman of the PIC was Lord Stanmore, formerly Sir Arthur Gordon, Governor of Fiji and first High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. John T. Arundel was the vice- chairman. The PIC continued to expand its plantation interests and in 1899, acquired a license to develop coconut plantations on Birnie Island, which is geographically part of the Phoenix Islands and is part of Kiribati, with the PIC attempting ti acquiring licenses to develop coconut plantations in the British Solomon Islands in 1900 and 1901.Hookey, J. F. \\"The Establishment Of A Plantation Economy in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate\\", Commission of Inquiry into the Land Dealings & Abandoned Properties on Guadalcanal; retrieved 16 May 2011 Despite this attempt to broaden the operations of the company the company remained chronically short of capital throughout its existence and was lent money from time to time by its directors. The PIC abandoned the plans to develop coconut plantations in 1902.  Pacific Phosphate Company Ltd  Phosphate rock used as door stop In 1899 Albert Ellis made what he later described as \\"a good 'find'\\", when he had laboratory analysis carried out on a rock that was used to prop open the Sydney office door, as it appeared similar to the hard phosphate rock that he had seen on Baker IslandAlbert F. Ellis, (1935) Ocean Island and Nauru: Their Story, Chapter IV The laboratory analysis confirmed that the rock was high grade phosphate. Albert Ellis and other company employees travelled to Banaba to confirm that the soil of that island was largely phosphate rock. A. F. Ellis went on to Nauru, at that time a German territory, and confirmed it also consisted of large deposits of phosphate rock. J. T. Arundel and Lord Stanmore were responsible for financing the new opportunities and negotiating with the German company that controlled the licences to mine in Nauru. In 1902 the interests of PIC were merged with Jaluit Gesellschaft of Hamburg, to form the Pacific Phosphate Company, ('PPC') to engage in phosphate mining in Nauru and Banaba, then known as Ocean Island. The company's engineers had to find solutions for transferring the phosphate rock from the island to ships that had to anchor off the island. As high islands both Nauru and Banaba did not have lagoons or anchorages that protected ships from the Pacific storms. Solutions were found and despite losing some 5 ships on the reef at Ocean Island, the PPC became a very profitable company. The profitability of the company directed attention to the original agreements made with the land owners of Nauru and Banaba. The agreement with the Banabans was for the exclusive right to mine for 999 years for ¬£50 a year. The terms of the licenses were changed to provide for the payment of royalties and compensation for mining damage. In 1913 an anonymous correspondent to the New Age journal criticised the operation of the PPC under the title \\"Modern buccaneers in the West Pacific\\". The PPC investigated phosphate deposits on Makatea in the Tuamotus in French Polynesia and formed a company, the Compagnie des Phosphates de l'Oc√©anie, with a Tahitian syndicate that was also investigating the potential of Makatea. This gave the PPC a virtual monopoly on the sources of high grade phosphate in the Pacific.Maslyn Williams & Barrie Macdonald (1985) The Phosphateers, p. 80. In 1919 the business of the PPC in Nauru and Banaba was acquired by Board of the British Phosphate Commission. From 1919 the responsibility for the welfare of the people of Nauru and Banaba, the restoring of land and water resources lost by mining operations and compensation for environmental damage to the islands was under the control of the governments of United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.ICJ Pleadings, Oral Arguments, Documents, Case Concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v.

It is the name that each of the sports teams at the university are referred to. The university is a member of the Colonial Athletic Association and competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision, fielding 17 varsity teams in 11 sports. All of Elon's varsity teams currently compete in sports sponsored by the CAA. Elon moved to the Colonial Athletic Association on July 1, 2014.

The school's first intercollegiate athletic event came in 1900 when the school played two baseball games against Guilford College in a home-and-home series and the first gymnasium was built in 1905. Football began play in 1909, while men's basketball followed in 1911. In 1921, the team was first called the Fightin' Christians. The moniker is said to have been coined by a sportswriter covering a contest between Elon and nearby Guilford College, a Quaker school. The school became a charter member of the North State Conference in 1930 and remained a member of the conference and its successors until departing for the South Atlantic Conference in 1989. The Fightin' Christians saw great success in the North State Conference, winning numerous conference titles and national championships. The football team won NAIA national titles in 1980 and 1981 under Coach Jerry Tolley, who was named national coach of the year for the 1980 season. Both titles were won in championship games played on Elon's home field in neighboring Burlington, North Carolina. The men's golf team and men's tennis teams also claimed NAIA national championships in 1982 and 1990, respectively. Women's sports became a part of the Elon athletic department in the early 1970s, as legendary coach Kay Yow began her college coaching career by guiding the first-ever women's basketball and women's volleyball teams at Elon. Softball was added in 1977, while women's tennis began play in 1979. Six other women's teams have been added in the years since, including soccer, cross country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track and lacrosse. In 1993, the South Atlantic Conference and its members moved from NAIA competition to NCAA Division II, where Elon would remain through the 1996‚Äì1997 season. In 1997, Elon began the transition into NCAA Division I, becoming a full member in 1999. Division I membership meant a new conference and Elon joined the Big South Conference. The women's soccer team quickly earned the school's first ever NCAA Division I tournament berth by winning the Big South tournament in the fall of 1999. Still known as the Fightin' Christians at the time, many did not feel that the nickname was universal enough for a team making the transition to Division I athletics. In 2000, Elon College officially changed its mascot to the Phoenix. The choice refers to a 1923 fire that destroyed nearly the entire campus. Soon after the fire, the university trustees began planning to make Elon \\"rise from the ashes\\". The Phoenix was a mythical creature that rose from the ashes of its predecessors. At the beginning of the 2001‚Äì02 season, the school was renamed Elon University to better reflect growing educational options. Change was not far behind in athletics as the Phoenix became members of the Southern Conference beginning in 2003. Facilities Elon's sports facilities include the Schar Center, Alumni Gym, Walter C. Latham Park, Rhodes Stadium, the on-campus football stadium, Alumni Field House, Koury Field House, Rudd Field, Hunt Softball Park, Jimmy Powell Tennis Center, the Jeanne and Jerry Robertson Track and Field Complex, Rudd Field and the Worseley Golf Center. Schar Center, the replacement for Alumni Gym as the home of Phoenix men's basketball, women's basketball and volleyball, opened on August 28, 2018 with a volleyball match against North Carolina A&T.;  Notable former athletes  Hal Bradley, Football (1936) Jesse Branson, Basketball (1965) Ward Burton, NASCAR Driver (1985) Clint Irwin, Soccer (2010) Steven Kinney, Soccer (2009) Daniel Lovitz, Soccer (2013) Joey Hackett, Football (1981) Greg W.

It comprises two species of creeping succulent, perennial, aquatic or semi- aquatic herbaceous plants. Its distribution range is disjunct: one species is endemic to New Zealand (mainly Stewart Island, Otago and Southland) while the other one is endemic to southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. These plants bear essential oils. Description=Leaves= The leaves stem short and erect from prostrate rooting stems. They are simple, opposite leaves, with aromatic glands and no stipule. The leaves are connate by flattened petioles. The lamina is simple, minutely denticulate on the margin, and leathery on the surface. =Flower= Flowers are solitary and can be axillary or terminal. They are tetramerous, without free hypanthium. There are a distinct calyx, which consists of 4 fused sepals, and a distinct corolla, consisting of 4 fused petals. The androecium consists of 4 free, epipetalous stamens, all of which are fertile. The stamens alternate with the corolla lobes. The anthers are dorsifixed and introrse. Pollen grains are aperturate and colporate. The gynoecium consists of 2 carpels. Each carpel is deeply lobed, giving the impression that there are in fact 4 carpels, ostensibly isomerous with the perianth. The ovary is syncarpous and have either 4 or 2 locules, each one housing 1 or 2 anatropous ovules. Stigmas are inconspicuous. The placentation mode is basal. = Fruit and seed = The fruit is a schizocarp associated with 4, one-seeded, setulose nutlets. The seeds are extensively endospermic.  Reproduction  These plants are hermaphrodites.

In 1875, he obtained his doctorate from the University of Zurich, where, as a student, he was an assistant to Karl Joseph Eberth in pathological anatomy. In 1886, he succeeded Johann Friedrich Horner as professor of ophthalmology at Zurich, a position he held until 1919. Otto Haab made contributions involving pathological anatomy of the eye, as well as in treatment of eye-related lesions. In 1885 he clinically described what he called senile macular disease, today known as senile or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and investigated the atrophic and pigmentary changes in the macular region of the eye associated with the condition. His name is associated with several medical eponyms, that include: \\"Haab's reflex\\", which is another name for pupillary light reflex, and \\"Haab's magnet\\", a powerful magnet used for removing metallic particles from the eye. Also, the \\"Haab scale\\" is a device used to measure pupillary diameter, and \\"Haab's striae\\" are horizontal breaks in the Descemet membrane associated with congenital glaucoma.

The comic's first pages were published on September 27, 2007, and the final pages were published on March 16, 2011. During its run, The Phoenix Requiem updated with 2-3 new pages on Mondays and Thursdays. Ellerton described The Phoenix Requiem as \\"the story of one man trying to forget the ghosts of his past against a backdrop of a Victorian-era world, where magic, long lost to the people, may be returning.\\" Plot summary The story begins when Jonas Faulkner is found unconscious with two gunshot wounds in the woods outside the small town of Esk. He is nursed back to health by Anya Katsukova, a doctor-in-training, and the two became friends. Around the same time Jonas arrives, however, a supernatural plague begins to affect the town of Esk, killing several of its inhabitants. In the meantime, Robyn Hart, a former soldier who holds unreciprocated romantic feelings for Anya, begins seeing ghostly apparitions around the town. During a ride in the forest, Jonas, Anya, Robyn, and their friend Petria encounter a \\"spirit,\\" one of the beings from the ancient past who have been imprisoned for many centuries before the events of the story take place. Upon returning to the village, they are interrogated by an investigator from another city, Patrick Armand, who has been following Jonas since he was released from a mental hospital. Armand reveals that the plague in Esk had also befallen every other town Jonas had been through. While working with her superior, Doctor Blythe, to find a cure for the spreading plague, Anya is visited again by a spirit. That night, she encounters a \\"shade\\", a monstrous manifestation of a person who has died a traumatic death, and the following morning, the plague has spread to a large number of people. Doctor Blythe sends Anya on an urgent mission to the medical research committee in Aubeny with data they have collected on the plague, to try to find a solution. However, the medical committee in Aubeny is indifferent to her findings, attributing the plague to food contamination instead, based on the reports of the same plague from another town. She is dismissed outright when she mentions the shades. Meanwhile, back in Esk, Robyn is attacked by a shade one night. He determines to fight back as the plague continues to spread and more shades appear, attacking the priest and threatening to overrun the town. A messenger is sent overnight on horseback to bring help to the escalating situation. Major characters *Anya Katsukova Anya Katsukova, stated to be under twenty, is a nurse training to be a doctor. She has long been skeptical about the existence of magic, spirits and hellions, preferring to believe only in the God of her home country, Mishara; however, her beliefs have undergone some unexpected alterations of late. *Jonas Faulkner Jonas Faulkner arrived in Esk after being shot almost fatally for reasons unknown. A charming, wealthy individual, it has been revealed that he has a connection to otherworldly spirits, and is suspected by many characters (most notably his pursuer, Patrick Armand) of being somehow responsible for the plague that is occurring at the time of the story. *Robyn Hart Robyn is a former soldier who works as a herder of caribou at the time of the story. He is romantically interested in Anya, who appears not to reciprocate those feelings. He claims that he has for several months been able to see ghosts and other abnormal things, especially when he is near Jonas, for which reason he appears to be deeply distrustful of that character. He is close friends with, and protective of, Petria Grey. *Petria Grey Petria was abandoned at a young age by her parents, and has survived by doing odd jobs around town; it is suggested in the story that Robyn Hart has taken care of her in the past. *Patrick Armand A police officer who came to Esk looking for Jonas. He appears to believe Jonas responsible for the plague that is spreading. Reception The Phoenix Requiem was nominated for 11 awards at the 2008 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, including Outstanding Comic. Top Web Comics has put Phoenix Requiem as the most popular webcomic on their site as of September 2008. Like its predecessor Inverloch, The Phoenix Requiem has received praise for its artwork. On the other hand, it was criticized early on for the slow pacing of its first volume. Richard Pulfer of Broken Frontier called the first volume of the comic \\"a fantastic-looking online graphic novel moving at a snail's pace,\\" but stated that as the comic has progressed the characters have become more dynamic and the story more profound. In 2008, The Phoenix Requiem won the award for Best Art in Frumph.net's WebComic Readers Choice Awards.

At the 2015 Carnaval Brasileiro Austin  Origin  Carnaval in Brazil derives from the medieval Christian revels in Europe held just prior to the forty days of Lent. This annual festival of flesh was further enriched in Brazil by African rhythms, especially the samba. Carnaval is an all-consuming nationwide festival in Brazil, celebrated differently in each part of the country by all social classes over a period of four days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday.  History  The Austin celebration began around 1975. At that time there were many Brazilian scholarship students at UT taking a six-week-long intensive English course. Faced with the prospect of a February without Carnaval, they decided with their local friends to hold their own celebration. Carnaval '75 took place in a small room at Austin's Unitarian Church. The two hundred or so revelers had planted a seed. For the next several years the party moved further downtown, drawing ever larger crowds. Carnaval '76, held at the Bucket (a bar) on West 23rd Street, drew over three hundred, who struggled to keep their footing in the spilled beer. A highlight of that evening was the thunderous collapse of a low stage under the weight of fifty wildly drumming Brazilians. They just looked at one another for a second, saw no one was hurt, and partied on! A group of devoted \\"Brasilianistas\\" continued to organize a Carnaval that began growing rapidly beyond their control. The last party to retain the original University focus was held at Dobie Center in 1977, with over five hundred participants. The size of the crowd and problems with the home-style sound system pointed up the need for a large hall with professional sound equipment. As the number of scholarships dwindled, the Brazilian students were gradually submerged into a Carnaval that Austinites were making their own. At this point Mike Quinn entered the picture. Quinn, the producer of Horizontes, a daily radio program dedicated to the music of Latin America on KUT-FM (Austin's NPR affiliate), was in 1978 a salesman at Discount Records. Quinn undertook the organization of Carnaval '78 as an outlet for his own creative interests in Brazilian music. The celebration, held at the double-tiered Boondocks Club (later Club Foot, and even later a parking lot) on East 4th Street in downtown Austin, was the take-off for Carnaval Brasileiro as it exists today. Carnaval '78 packed in over a thousand bodies, sweating and gyrating to the drumming of Austin's first Carnaval group: an ad hoc assembly of local musicians including ethnomusicologists from UT and members of Beto y Los Fairlanes, all under the direction of Dr. Gerard Behague of the UT Department of Music. Though the drumming was improvised, the atmosphere was magic and it set the stage for the live music featured at every Carnaval since. That party continued until 4:00am, and the club had to repaint the dance floor the following week! Accordingly, in 1979 Carnaval moved into the legendary Armadillo World Headquarters (now defunct), where Austin's first Brazilian band, Os Imperialistas do Samba (later Unidos de Austin), played to a capacity house of 1800. The night's three-dollar tickets were scalped outside for as much as twenty-five dollars. In 1980 Carnaval Brasileiro finally moved to the warehouse-like Coliseum, which, despite two sojourns at Austin's 7,000 capacity Palmer Auditorium (1981 and 1984), has become its home. The 1980 Carnaval also inaugurated the classic series of Austin artist Guy Juke's poster and T-shirt designs. The event continued to grow in size and sophistication throughout the 1980s. Meanwhile, organizers have searched for the right formula to make the party sizzle. The earlier costume contests were dropped because they interrupted the flow of the music and dancing. It has continued to be held at various venues around the city.  Music  Carnaval Brasileiro features Austin Samba, the largest samba group in the United States. The Music of Carnaval‚Äîsamba, march, frevo, trio electrico, and much batucada, or drumming‚Äînow pours out in seamless, driving, ninety-minute sets. This is the euphoria of a real Carnaval, magnified by an arena-style sound system that makes three or four drums sound like a hundred. The key to the samba sound is the heavy boom of the surdo bass drums set against the counter- rhythms and back beats for the smaller percussion.

Madey; 'Lebanese Arabic Transliteration: , .) (May 15, 1890 ‚Äì November 23, 1957) was a Lebanese poet. Early life Abu Madi was born in the village of Al-Muhaydithah, now part of Bikfaya, Lebanon, on May 15, 1890 to a Christian family. At the age of 11 he moved to Alexandria, Egypt where he worked with his uncle. Career and Works In 1911, Elia Abu Madi published his first collection of poems, Tazkar al-Madi. Shortly after, he was exiled by the Ottoman Turkish authorities and he left Egypt for the United States, where he settled in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1916 he moved to New York City and began a career in journalism. In New York Abu Madi met and worked with a number of Arab-American poets including Kahlil Gibran. He married the daughter of Najeeb Diab, editor of the Arabic-language magazine Meraat-ul-Gharb, and became the chief editor of that publication in 1918. His second poetry collection, Diwan Iliya Abu Madi, was published in New York in 1919; his third and most important collection, Al-Jadawil (\\"The Streams\\"), appeared in 1927. His other books were Al-Khama'il (\\"The Tickets\\")(1940) and Tibr wa Turab (posthumous, 1960). In 1929 Abu Madi founded his own periodical, Al-Samir, in Brooklyn. It began as a monthly but after a few years appeared five times a week. His poems are very well known among Arabs; poet, author, and journalist Gregory Orfalea wrote that \\"his poetry is as commonplace and memorized in the Arab world as that of Robert Frost is in ours.\\"In A Community of Many Worlds: Arab Americans in New York City, ed.

Limerick to Ennis The Limerick to Ennis suburban service runs over the southernmost of the former Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway(WL&WR;) track between Limerick and the junction with the Dublin‚ÄìGalway mainline at Athenry. In the 2016 timetable, nine services per weekday are operated from Limerick to Ennis and vice versa, five and four of each being stops made by Limerick-Galway InterCity trains respectively. Sunday service is eight trains from Limerick to Ennis and nine trains from Ennis to Limerick, and similarly four trains per direction are Limerick-Galway InterCity services. Services are timetabled for a 40-minute duration. Passenger services on this section ceased in 1976 but were re-introduced in 1988 as far as Ennis and were increased progressively until a full six-weekday service was begun in 1994 which also had a limited Sunday service. A further expansion to eight services per weekday was begun in 2003 with the timetable further reorganised in March 2010 to incorporate the newly reopened track north of Ennis and services between Limerick and Galway. Iarnr√≥d √âireann proposed that its timetable revision in 2011 would include an extra train from Galway to Ennis to meet an existing Limerick‚ÄìEnnis‚ÄìLimerick train to create a sixth service per direction per weekday between Limerick and Galway. As of 2016, both InterCity and Commuter services are operated by 2800 Class diesel railcars whose top speed is sufficient for the limits of the existing single-track line ( with partial restrictions of between . These railcars normally operate in sets of two, offering 85 seats but platform lengths will allow between one and four such cars to operate together. The signalling system on this line only allows one train operating in the section at a time, but a passing loop is planned for the section's only intermediate halt at Sixmilebridge, which would permit trains to depart from Ennis and from Limerick at about the same time and pass each other within the limits of the loop track. Limerick to Nenagh The Limerick to Nenagh line operates over a short section of the line between Limerick and Limerick Junction before joining the Limerick‚ÄìBallybrophy railway line at Killonan Junction. This service normally operates in a block section where trains cannot operate at the same time but changes were made at Nenagh to allow the first Limerick‚ÄìBallybrophy train of the day to split there, with the front half continuing to Cloughjordan, Roscrea and Ballybrophy to meet the Dublin‚ÄìCork mainline and the back half turning back for Limerick forming the commuter service. There are five services, three inbound and two outbound, per weekday between Limerick and Nenagh, four of which continue to or from Ballybrophy. As of 2016, there is only one inbound service to Limerick in the morning timetabled to arrive at 08:45 and one evening outbound at 17:50. Journey time is timetabled at between 55 and 68 minutes. The service is operated by 2800 Class diesel railcars, whose top speeds are sufficient for the 60 mph limits between Limerick and Killonan Junction but is hampered by the condition of the track between Killonan Junction and Nenagh. Some track upgrades from jointed track to Continuous Welded Rail offering higher safe speeds and a quieter operation have been started but not completed by operations such as ballast tamping and rail stressing. Additionally, the route misses the key employment area of Castletroy on the eastern outskirts of Limerick which contains both a major industrial estate and the University of Limerick. A January 2012 national newspaper article suggested that Irish Rail was expected to seek permission from the National Transport Authority to close the line.http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/iarnrod-eireann-may-close-rail- service-amid-falling-demand-178779.html However the announcement on 20 February 2012 of an enhanced timetable for the line means that this threat is lifted, at least for the time being. Limerick to Limerick Junction This service is principally a shuttle along part of the Limerick‚ÄìRosslare railway line between Limerick station and Limerick Junction connecting to and from mainline services between Dublin and Cork as well as to a regional service to Waterford. In the late 2000s, an enhanced commuter aspect was developed involving expansion of car parking at Limerick Junction was completed and in 2010 Iarnr√≥d √âireann also introduced a morning service from Thurles to Limerick from Monday to Friday which passes through Limerick Junction. There are no intermediate stops on the Limerick Junction‚ÄìKillonan Junction section or the Killonan Junction‚ÄìLimerick section. Some services are part of direct Dublin‚ÄìLimerick intercity trains operating using 22000 Class InterCity diesel railcars and the others operate using 2800 Class diesel railcars. Journey time is between 25 and 36 minutes in the 2016 timetable. As of 2016, commuting from east of Limerick Junction is hampered by the current arrangement where the train arriving from Cahir, Clonmel and Waterford at 09:00 does not proceed onward to Limerick and a shuttle train to Limerick does not depart until 09:40.

It links the 12th and 13th arrondissement of Paris by extending the Boulevard de Bercy and Boulevard Vincent-Auriol. In addition to the roadway, the bridge also carries Line 6 of the Paris M√©tro, between Quai de la Gare station and Bercy station. History Location on the Seine The Pont de Bercy was built at the site of another bridge, a suspension bridge opened in 1832 to replace a ferry that had become overcrowded and thus exceeded its tonnage limit. The former bridge had a toll: one sou (5 centimes) for pedestrians, 3 sous per two-wheeled cabriolet (including persons transported) and 5 sous per car with four wheels attached to two horses. Between 1863 and 1864, it was replaced by a stronger stone structure. In 1904, the bridge was enlarged by 5.5 metres (18 feet) to support Line 6 of the Paris M√©tro. In 1986, the decision was made to further enlarge the bridge in order to create three additional lanes for traffic. The winning bid proposed doubling the bridge by adding extensions perfectly symmetrical to the underground viaduct. Although identical in all respects to the original, the new addition is built of reinforced concrete and covered with a stone dressing. The work started in 1989 and the bridge was opened in 1992, effectively adding 16 metres (50 feet) for a total width of 35 metres (130 feet).

Life The Neubauer family was part of a small Jewish community in Krems an der Donau, Austria, where Peter was born on July 5, 1913. He received his medical training at the University of Vienna and the University of Bern, in Switzerland, to which he escaped during the Nazi control of Austria. He completed his psychiatric training in Bern in 1941. Neubauer died in New York City on February 15, 2008, at the age of 94. Career Neubauer immigrated to New York in 1941, where he took a position on the staff of Bellevue Hospital. In an early influential paper, \\"The One-Parent Child and His Oedipal Development\\" (1960), Neubauer indicated that a father's absence could jeopardize child development as seriously as maternal deprivation.The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child 15 (1960): 286, 287, 293, 295, 297, 298, 299, 302, 303, 305, 308. He worked closely with Anna Freud at the Hampstead Clinic in London, and from the 1970s to his death, Neubauer was a co-editor of The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, an annual publication of Yale University. He was one of the first to study the emotional impact on children witnessing violence in television and film. Neubauer's published books include Nature's Thumbprint: The New Genetics of Personality, which includes some discussion of his controversial long-term study of adoptive Jewish twins (at least five sets) and triplets (one set) separated during infancy. Neither the children nor their adoptive parents were aware of the real reason they were all being studied or that the children had identical siblings. Some of the twins eventually learned that their separation had been deliberate as a \\"nature versus nurture\\" experiment by Neubauer. These revelations led to controversy, anger, and ethical comparisons with notorious twin experiments by the same Nazi regime that Neubauer had escaped. Some of the subjects of Neubauer's twin study have sought records, apologies and compensation from the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, which inherited Neubauer's study records. At least three of the separated siblings apparently committed suicide. The experiment was discussed in the 2007 memoir Identical Strangers: A Memoir of Twins Separated and Reunited by Elyse Schein and Paula Bernstein, as well as the documentary films The Twinning Reaction (2017)The Twinning Reaction: Official Site.

January 28, 2018. and the television episode Secret Siblings (2018). At the conclusion of the study in 1980, Neubauer reportedly feared that public opinion would be against the study, and declined to publish it. The records of the study are sealed at the Yale University Library until October 25, 2065, although by 2018, some 10,000 pages had been released but were heavily redacted and inconclusive. Neubauer served as Director of the Jewish Board's Child Development Center, President of the Association for Child Psychoanalysis, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at New York University, and Secretary General of the International Association of Child Psychiatry and Allied Professions.

Racing career As a two year old, Coronado's Quest won three graded stakes, all in New York, including a victory in the Remsen Stakes over future Blue Grass Stakes winner Halory Hunter. The following year, he was known for his moody temperament (which earned him the nickname \\"the Bad Boy of Racing\\") as much as his talent. He started his three- year-old campaign in Florida with a second in the Hutcheson stakes to Time Limit after dumping jockey Mike Smith before the race. His antics just got worse from there, coming to a head with a dismal fifth in the Florida Derby, which effectively ended his chance at the Kentucky Derby. After the fiasco in Florida, Coronado's Quest returned to New York. He underwent a routine surgery to fix an entrapped epiglottis and the improvement was dramatic. He reeled off five straight graded stakes scores, culminating in a nose win over Belmont Stakes winner Victory Gallop in the Travers Stakes. It was eerily similar to his sire's Travers win over Seeking the Gold and Brian's Time ten years prior. Stallion career Coronado's Quest was retired to stand stud at the historic Claiborne Farm in 1999. He was sold to Japan in 2003, where he died March 8, 2006 from heart failure after covering a mare at the Japan Bloodhorse Breeders' Association's Shizunai Stallion Station in Hokkaido. Coronado's Quest was only moderately successful at stud, despite his excellent pedigree and race record. He sired seventeen stakes winners, including multiple Grade I winner Society Selection in America, Grade I winner Crucifijo in Mexico and Group 2 winner Al Jadeed in Europe. While standing in Japan he sired Grade 3 winner Ceres Hunt („Çª„É¨„Çπ„Éè„É≥„Éà Seresuhanto). Though a disappointment as a sire, he has quickly become a top young broodmare sire.

In modern electronic design process floorplans are created during the floorplanning design stage, an early stage in the hierarchical approach to integrated circuit design. Depending on the design methodology being followed, the actual definition of a floorplan may differ. Floorplanning Floorplanning takes in some of the geometrical constraints in a design. Examples of this are: * bonding pads for off-chip connections (often using wire bonding) are normally located at the circumference of the chip; * line drivers often have to be located as close to bonding pads as possible; * chip area is therefore in some cases given a minimum area in order to fit in the required number of pads; * areas are clustered in order to limit data paths thus frequently featuring defined structures such as cache RAM, multiplier, barrel shifter, line driver and arithmetic logic unit; * purchased intellectual property blocks (IP-blocks), such as a processor core, come in predefined area blocks; * some IP-blocks come with legal limitations such as permitting no routing of signals directly above the block. Mathematical models and optimization problems In some approaches the floorplan may be a partition of the whole chip area into axis aligned rectangles to be occupied by IC blocks. This partition is subject to various constraints and requirements of optimization: block area, aspect ratios, estimated total measure of interconnects, etc. Finding good floorplans has been a research area in combinatorial optimization. Most of the problems related to finding optimal floorplans are NP-hard, i.e., require vast computational resources. Therefore, the most common approach is to use various optimization heuristics for finding good solutions. Another approach is to restrict design methodology to certain classes of floorplans, such as sliceable floorplans. =Sliceable floorplans= A sliceable floorplan, with a slicing order indicated The simplest non-sliceable floorplan A sliceable floorplan is a floorplan that may be defined recursively as described below. \\"The Electrical Engineering Handbook\\", Richard C. Dorf (1997) *A floorplan that consists of a single rectangular block is sliceable. *If a block from a sliceable floorplan is cut (\\"sliced\\") in two by a vertical or horizontal line, the resulting floorplan is sliceable. Sliceable floorplans have been used in a number of early Electronic Design Automation tools for a number of reasons. Sliceable floorplans may be conveniently represented by binary trees (more specifically, k-d trees), which correspond to the order of slicing. More importantly, a number of NP-hard problems with floorplans have polynomial time algorithms when restricted to sliceable floorplans.Sarrafzadeh, M, \\"Transforming an arbitrary floorplan into a sliceable one\\", Proc. 1993 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD-93), pp. 386-389.

He won Magarey Medals in 1994 and 1995. McIntosh primarily played as a centreman or rover and remained loyal to Norwood throughout his career, playing a record 336 games for the club before his retirement in 1998. He was a premiership player with them twice, the first came in his debut season in 1982 and the second in 1984. A third premiership was within his grasp in 1997, but McIntosh missed the grand final through suspension. From 1990 to 1998 he was club captain and in 2002 he returned to Norwood to serve as their senior coach for three seasons. He was drafted by in the 1982 VFL Draft,Interstate Draft 1982 but chose to stay in South Australia. McIntosh was arguably the finest footballer outside the AFL throughout the 1990s. A fine interstate player, he also represented South Australia 12 times during his career. He won three Fos Williams Medals: in 1984 for his performance against Western Australia, in 1992 against the WAFL, and in 1995 against Tasmania. In all, McIntosh played 388 matches in his overall career, including 35 night series matches. He also represented Australia in the International Rules Series in 1984 and 1986 playing five matches - once cleaning up Dermot McNicholl in the 1986 match in Perth resulting in missing the next test due to suspension. After retiring, he coached North Launceston to runners-up in the Tasmanian Statewide League in 2000. Former North Adelaide and Norwood player Andrew Jarman cited McIntosh as his toughest SANFL opponent. Jarman won the 1987 Magarey Medal: that year, McIntosh polled the most votes, but was ineligible due to suspension. McIntosh currently coaches Payneham Norwood Union in the SAAFL. He gained promotion to Division One after a winning the Division Two Grand Final in 2014. The club made the grand final in Division One in 2015, but was beaten to Goodwood Saints. He also coaches the under 15 'A' Team in for Payneham Norwood Union in the SANFL Juniors.

History  The radio station was launched in 1990 and was called the Turkish Radio, broadcasting to the Turkish and Turkish speaking Communities for the first time under the name of Turkish Radio, for only one hour per day between the hours of midnight to 1a.m. Because the response to the small broadcast was so successful, a licence to broadcast 24 hours a day was granted. The name of the radio station changed in 1994 to London Turkish Radio (LTR), and has since grown in popularity, and is the only fully licensed radio station broadcasting in Turkish for a full 24hr. period outside Turkey and Northern Cyprus.  Coverage  Coverage extends over most of the London Boroughs where large numbers of Turkish and Turkish speaking communities reside. According to Ofcom (Office of Communications), LTR has over 80,000 listeners in the London Borough of Haringey alone.

It is located in the picturesque Yarrowitch River Valley on the Oxley Highway 48 kilometres east of Walcha. The settlement is included in the Walcha Shire Local Government Area in the New England region. The locality is at an elevation of about 995 metres and the area is part of Vernon County. At the , the Yarrowitch area had a population of 167. History John Oxley's expedition passed through Yarrowitch on 17 September 1818. They camped overnight on the eastern side of the River, before traversing the steep, rugged terrain and almost impenetrable scrub on their way to Port Macquarie. The name, Yarrowitch, was probably derived from the English place name Yarrow, although there is an Aboriginal word 'Yarrawee', said to mean 'gum tree growing in water'. John Allman and N. Powell occupied the area in c.1836. Shortly afterwards they were joined by Allman's brother, Francis. In about 1839 the Allmans were joined by Arthur Hodgson and by the end of that year the land had been divided into two sections. The following year, 1840, runs were acquired by Alexander Todd and Christopher Dawson Fenwicke. They were the first licensed lessees of Yarrowitch. Todd, licence 114, held east Yarrowitch containing , and Fenwicke, licence 53, held western Yarrowitch containing . The Robertson Land Acts introduced in 1861 enabled small farmers to select blocks of Crown Land, and this further expanded the area. By 1900 the Yarrowitch district was fairly well established and an item from the Walcha Witness in 1898 gave an insight into life at Yarrowitch at the time ... \\"Yarrowitch News . . . Matters are looking up this way lately as regards selecting and new buildings. The new school building has been erected on a more sheltered situation and reflects credit on the contractor's workmanship. What with wheat and maize growing, pig farming and onion growing, some of the more recent selectors have now fairly lined pockets. The potato crop turned out fairly well but from appearances, wheat is going to be a general favourite with us\\". As well as these farming crops, cattle and sheep grazing and Australian Red Cedar cutting were the main sources of income. In 1948 the New South Wales Department of Lands purchased Yarrowitch Station for closer settlement under the Lands Settlement Act. The property was then divided into seventeen blocks which were balloted out to returned soldiers and their families. Most of the district was able to have a telephone connected in the 1930s. Yarrowitch settlement was connected to 240 volt electricity in 1962, although many outlying areas such as Kangaroo Flat were still unconnected. In 1977 the Oxley Highway was sealed to Walcha and Port Macquarie which made for much better access to these towns. Previously travel along this road was at the mercy of the weather which had sometimes meant that some of the hills became too slippery to negotiate. During the 1980s the property Glenferrie in the Kangaroo Flat area was split up into many small blocks. Quite a few of the owners of these blocks only visited their land on the weekends and were known as \\"weekend or hobby farmers\\". Yarrowitch has a church, public school, sports ground and a community hall. Attractions Werrikimbe National Park, a large and remote World Heritage listed park is situated on the end of the Kangaroo Flat Road about 26 kilometres from Yarrowitch. Most of Werrikimbe Park is protected under the World Heritage list, which recognises places of outstanding importance across the planet. The National Park is home to the rare mammal, the Hastings River Mouse, considered to be in imminent danger of extinction.

Built in 1874, it was the home of Doctor Fisk Holbrook Day (1826-1903), a prominent local physician and amateur geologist. The stylistically eclectic house was built in part to house Day's large collection of artifacts, and is the Milwaukee suburb's only major 19th-century mansion. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. and It is privately owned and not open to the public. Description and history The Dr. Fisk Holbrook Day House stands on Wauwatosa's west side, on the north side of West Milwaukee Avenue just west of Day Court. The house, set well back from the road, is accessed via both a long drive from West Milwaukee and a short drive off the west side of Day Court. It is a large 2-1/2 story brick building, with a rectangular main block extended to the rear and side by projections. The main block is covered by a mansard roof with patterned red and yellow cedar shingles on a bed of gray, with iron cresting at the top of the steep section. The projections and a single-story rear ell have steeply pitched gables in the Gothic style. The gables are decorated with ornate bargeboard trim. The front facade, oriented south toward the main road, is three bays wide, each bay stepped back from left to right. The central bay is topped by a mansarded three-story tower. The interior has restored high-quality original woodwork and plaster, including a fine central staircase and marble fireplace surrounds. The house was built in 1874 for Fisk Holbrook Day to a design by architect James Douglas. It was the third of Day's houses in Wauwatosa, the other two having since been demolished. It was designed in part specifically to house his growing collection of paleontological artifacts, which are now in the possession of the University of Michigan. A prominent local physician, he was appointed to the county hospital commission, where he was influential in securing reforms of the local mental hospitals. During his free time he collected fossils at regional rock outcroppings, notably the Schoonmaker Reef, and corresponded with numerous high-profile professional geologists and paleontologists of the time. Day moved out of this house after his wife died in 1893. It was then converted into multiple units as a rental property, and fell into disrepair. The pianist Liberace once sought to purchase this home as the location for his museum in 1978.Liberace Planning Tour of Mansion. The Milwaukee Journal, 30 July 1978. It has since undergone a careful restoration.

While playing for St Mirren, McCormack acquired the nickname \\"Cowboy\\", because he had the same name as a professional boxer with that nickname. He moved to Dundee in 1984 before returning to the west of Scotland in 1986, spending single seasons with Airdrieonians and Partick Thistle before retiring in 1988. Following his retirement from playing, McCormack was employed by Glasgow City Council for several years, working in sports centres in the city.

In the Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's classic musical version of it, which opened on Broadway on December 27, 1927, her stage name (or alias) is Julie La Verne. She is exposed as Julie Dozier in Act I. In Act II, Julie has changed her name, this time to Julie Wendel. Julie is married to Steve Baker, and both are actors on the show boat Cotton Blossom. However, they harbor a secret - Julie is part African-American, and Steve is white; therefore, according to the laws of the time, their marriage is illegal. They are an exceptionally close couple, and Steve is fiercely protective of her. Julie is also a close friend and surrogate mother-figure to ten-year-old Magnolia Hawks, daughter of Cap'n Andy Hawks, the show boat's owner. Andy is married to the shrewish Parthy Ann, who has disdain for all actors, especially Julie. Character history When Pete, a coarse engineer who works on the boat, makes unwanted advances toward Julie, Steve engages him in a fistfight. Pete knows that Julie is mixed and Steve white so he goes to the local sheriff and exposes the couple. Before the sheriff arrives, however, Steve takes out a pocket knife in front of the troupe, makes a cut on Julie's hand, and sucks some of her blood, so that he can truthfully claim that he has mixed blood in him. Nevertheless, the couple is obliged to leave the show boat because law at the time made it illegal for African-Americans to act on the stage with whites. After some years have past, Magnolia, now eighteen, becomes the new leading lady on the showboat. Many years after, just before being deserted in Chicago by her gambler husband Gaylord Ravenal, Magnolia accidentally discovers that Julie now works in a whorehouse. Julie is mortified by this turn of events. Author Ferber never reveals why Julie has become a prostitute, or what happened to her husband Steve. Show Boat's Julie is perhaps the first truly tragic character depicted in a musical. Most of what happens to her in the novel remains exactly the same in the show - she is still a biracial woman who is married to a white man and is forced to leave the show because of racist laws - an element once considered taboo in a musical play. There are, however, some major changes to her story in the musical: *The scenes with Julie on the show boat occur when Magnolia, Julie's best friend in the musical, is eighteen rather than still a child, and Magnolia becomes the troupe's leading lady immediately after Julie and Steve are forced to leave the boat. *Years later, Julie, rather than becoming a prostitute, becomes an alcoholic nightclub singer, despondent because Steve has ultimately left her. Magnolia, who has been abandoned by Ravenal, winds up auditioning at the same nightclub, without knowing that Julie is the featured singer. Julie, backstage, overhears the audition and deliberately (and secretly) quits her job so that Magnolia can have it. Magnolia goes on to become a great star, never learning of Julie's sacrifice. The ultimate fate of Julie remains a mystery, as in the novel, but Miles Kreuger, the musical theatre historian, has stated in the accompanying booklet to the 1988 EMI complete recording of Show Boat 's score that he believes that Julie's sacrifice probably will ultimately lead to her death (presumably from drinking). In the musical, the character of Julie is given two of Show Boat's most memorable songs, Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man and Bill. Portrayals In the show's original production, Julie was played by Helen Morgan, who made the role her own until her untimely death and reprised it in the 1932 stage revival, the 1936 film version of the show, and a 1940 Los Angeles revival. In the 1946 stage revival, the first U.S. revival after Morgan's death, Julie was played by Carol Bruce. In the 1951 Technicolor remake of \\"Show Boat\\", Julie was played by Ava Gardner, with her singing voice dubbed by Annette Warren. She was also given an additional scene in this version, in which she meets Ravenal a few years after he has deserted Magnolia and shames him into returning to her. (In the play and 1936 film, she is not seen again after she resigns from the nightclub.) In the 1929 part-talkie film version of Show Boat, based on the novel rather than the musical, Julie, played by Alma Rubens, was not biracial. In this version, Parthy orders her and Steve to leave the boat out of jealousy over Magnolia's affection for Julie. Later in the film Julie becomes not a mere prostitute in a whorehouse as in the novel, but the actual whorehouse madam. In the musical prologue to the 1929 film, made with sound, Helen Morgan was filmed singing Julie's two songs from the musical, Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man and Bill. While the usual custom in the past was to have a white actress play the role, it is now far more common to cast a biracial actress, despite the fact that the audience watching Show Boat is supposedly unaware that Julie is a mulatto until the sheriff reveals it. The first biracial actress to play Julie was Cleo Laine, in the 1971 London revival of the show. More recently, Lonette McKee portrayed Julie in Harold Prince's 1993 revival of the musical, as well as in the 1983 revival for which she earned a Tony Award nomination. Lena Horne briefly appeared as Julie in the Show Boat sequence in the Jerome Kern biopic Till the Clouds Roll By, in 1946, but MGM was reluctant to cast her in a true film version of the show because they feared that audiences would not welcome a black actress playing a romantic role in a film featuring both blacks and whites, so they gave the role to Gardner in the 1951 film Show Boat.

McCloughan (born March 1, 1971) is an American football executive. He was formerly the general manager of the San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins, as well as a senior personnel executive for the Seattle Seahawks, helping the 49ers and Seahawks eventually reach the Super Bowl in the 2010s with rosters he helped assemble.  Early life  McCloughan was born in Alameda, California on March 1, 1971, and grew up in Loveland, Colorado. McCloughan is the son of Kent McCloughan, who was a cornerback for the Oakland Raiders in the late 1960s, and is the brother of Dave McCloughan, who also played defensive back in the NFL. Growing up, McCloughan took an interest in scouting football players, where he and his father Kent, who was also a longtime scout for the Raiders after his playing career, would watch college player tape off a film projector in their basement. Prior to his career in American football, McCloughan played college baseball at Wichita State and participated in a couple of College World Series with the team. He later was drafted by the New York Mets in the 10th round of the 1989 MLB Draft, and the Toronto Blue Jays in the 10th round of the 1992 MLB Draft, although he never played in the major league for either team. However, McCloughan did play in the minor leagues, playing outfielder for the St. Catharines Blue Jays, Hagerstown Suns, and Dunedin Blue Jays from 1992 to 1994. Executive career Still an outfielder for the Dunedin Blue Jays in 1994, McCloughan received a call from then Green Bay Packers general manager Ron Wolf, who knew McCloughan's father from his playing days with the Oakland Raiders, and offered him a scouting job on the team. McCloughan accepted, and was a regional scout for the Packers from 1994 to 1999, where he took credit for the team drafting offensive guard Adam Timmerman, who later become a two-time Pro Bowler. He then went on to becoming the college scouting director for the Seattle Seahawks from 2000 to 2004, before joining the San Francisco 49ers in 2005 as the vice president of player personnel. In February 2008, McCloughan was promoted to general manager of the team. In March 2010, McCloughan and the 49ers agreed to a mutual termination of his contract, which was later revealed to be due to personal issues with alcoholism and an ongoing divorce. Shortly after leaving the 49ers, McCloughan was hired by Seattle Seahawks general manager and close friend, John Schneider, to be a senior personnel executive on the team. McCloughan accepted, and later assisted with the team's drafting of notable players in later rounds of the draft such as Russell Wilson, Kam Chancellor, and Richard Sherman. McCloughan remained in this position until April 2014, when he again resigned due to personal issues. After he left the Seahawks, McCloughan started up his own college scouting agency in Ferndale, Washington, where he evaluated incoming draftees for a handful of NFL teams. In January 2015, McCloughan was hired as general manager of the Washington Redskins. Despite helping build to the team to two straight winning seasons since his hiring, McCloughan was fired by the team in March 2017, again allegedly due to his issues with alcoholism. Following his departure from the team, McCloughan returned to running his scouting agency. He also worked as a consultant for the Cleveland Browns during the 2018 NFL Draft, as well as for the Philadelphia Eagles from 2017 to 2019.

Patients with certain severe valvular or ventricular anomalies (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome or single ventricle, etc.), have an abnormal cardiopulmonary circuit in which a single ventricle functionally serves as the driver of both systemic and pulmonary circulations. Typically, the bidirectional Glenn shunt is the second in a series of three staged surgeries to reconstruct a single ventricle heart, in situations where corrective bi-ventricular surgery or cardiac transplantation are not feasible. The bidirectional Glenn shunt procedure involves rerouting circulation such that the superior vena cava (SVC) drains into the right pulmonary artery. This results in deoxygenated blood returning from the head and upper body directly routed to the pulmonary arteries for oxygenation by the lungs, to some extent reducing the ventricular workload. Since the blood passing from the SVC into the pulmonary arterial system flows bidirectionally to both right and left lungs, it is called a bi-directional Glenn procedure. The Glenn procedure was introduced in 1958 by William Glenn and modifications to the procedure were published by Dr. Azzolina in 1973. The original description by Dr. Glenn allowed communication only between the right pulmonary artery and the SVC, whereas the modified technique had the SVC connecting at or before the bifurcation between the right and left pulmonary arteries.

He also studied at the Universities of Heidelberg, G√∂ttingen and T√ºbingen, and in addition to Liebermeister, regarded Karl Ewald Hasse (1810-1902), Jakob Henle (1809-1885) and August Socin (1837-1889) as important influences to his medical career. Between 1868 and 1879 Averbeck was a general practitioner and obstetrician in Bremen, and in 1879 opened an institute for physical therapy at Baden-Baden.

History The schoolhouse in 2004, before its 2005 renovation. The schoolhouse in 2012, after its 2005 renovation. =Construction= The structure was built in its original location in 1853 as a school building for the young town of Ripon, Wisconsin. It was championed as part of a wider education initiative by a New York transplant, Alvan Bovay. Bovay used his position in founding the school to further involve himself in politics, becoming a founder of the Republican Party, which formed during a meeting at the schoolhouse. The building is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It has modest Greek Revival styling, with a single entrance framed by pilasters and an entablature with cornice. There are sash windows on either side of the entrance. =Politics= In 1854, opposition grew to the proposed Kansas-Nebraska Bill. The bill was championed by the dominant Democratic Party, and the opposition was split among several smaller parties, including the Whig Party, the Free Soil Party, and some internal Democratic Party splintering. In Ripon, Bovay, who had gotten the schoolhouse built, lead the opposition, and canvassed support among opposition members of all the local parties. He called a meeting on March 20. The Whig and Free Soil parties dissolved themselves in favor of forming a new, united party to be called \\"Republican,\\" with some Democrats also defecting from their local party branch to join the new party. With publicity from the New York Tribune, word of the party spread, other local chapters and state-level parties started forming by July or earlier, and a national party was formed by 1856. Preservation The town quickly outgrew the small building, and built a larger brick building to replace it. The old building was sold to Wisconsin governor George Peck, for use as a home. By the early twentieth century, it had fallen into disuse, and was in danger of being demolished. Due to its historical significance, effort was put into saving the building. Local civic and historical organizations, considering its local and national historical significance, raised funds to save it. The building was refurbished, and moved to the campus of Ripon College. Later, it was moved twice more to other locations on campus. Its fourth and final move, in 1951, was to its present location. Twenty-two years later, it was recognized it as a historic site by the United States National Park Service, which declared it a National Historic Landmark in 1974. and From 2005 to 2007, the house underwent a renovation.

He owned saw mills and large tacks of timber land near the Metolius River, Black Butte, and Sisters, Oregon. He served seven terms in the Oregon House of Representatives; and along with his wife, founded the Samuel S. Johnson Foundation. He also served as mayor of Redmond, Oregon, from 1979 to 1984.  Early life  Johnson was born on September 1, 1911, in Berkeley, California. He was named after his grandfather, a sawmill owner from Minnesota. His father, Samuel Orie Johnson was a timber broker in California. Around 1903, his father moved to Central Oregon and began acquiring timber land in the area. His father bought what is now Black Butte Ranch, the Indian Ford area near Sisters, most of Green Ridge north of Black Butte, and the Wurzweiller Ranch, which included Camp Sherman and the headwaters of the Metolius River.Interview with Elizabeth H. Johnson (transcribed from tape by Maret Pajutee), Sisters Watershed History Fest, Sisters Country Historical Society, 2006. After graduating from the University of California at Berkeley's School of Forestry in 1934, Johnson returned to Central Oregon to act as his father's agent, buying and selling timber and land. During that time, Johnson lived in the old Sisters Hotel. In 1935, his father sold the that included the Metolious headwaters to him for one dollar. In the early 1930s, the Johnsons opened a saw mill in Sisters in partnership with Bert Peterson, the first of six Central Oregon mills the Johnson family owned over the years.History of Deschutes County in Oregon, Deschutes County Historical Society, Bend, Oregon: 1985, pp. 300-2. During World War II, Johnson served in the Army Corps of Engineers. As an Army Captain, Johnson ran the Corps of Engineers' procurement office in Portland, Oregon, that bought lumber and wood products from around Oregon and shipped them from the Port of Astoria to Army engineer and Navy Seabee units in the Pacific. While serving in Portland, Captain Johnson met his future wife Elizabeth (known as Becky). She was a Navy recruiter for the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (commonly known as WAVES). They married in 1944.\\"Former Faculty, Staff, Friends of College Mourned\\" , Chronicle, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon, Summer 2007.  Businessman  After the war, the Johnsons opened a new saw mill in Redmond, Oregon. The mill had direct access to the railroad so the operation could be greatly expanded. In 1948, Johnson bought his father's Oregon timber holdings and mills, and opened his own office in Sisters. Johnson was successful at negotiating timber sale contracts with the United States Forest Service. As a result, his operations continued uninterrupted while many of Central Oregon's saw mills were closing. In 1967, Johnson sold his Jefferson Plywood Company mill at Warm Springs to the Warm Springs tribal council for $1.34 million and provided additional plywood and veneer-making equipment to help the tribe establish Warm Springs Forest Products Industries. This new tribal business improved the economic conditions on the Warm Springs Reservation.Binus, Joshus, \\"Warm Springs Reservation Mill\\", The Oregon History project, Oregon Historical Society, 2003.  Public service  In 1965, Johnson was elected to a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives, and was re-elected six more times, serving continuously through the 1977 legislative session. He represented Crook, Deschutes and Jefferson counties from 1965 to 1972, and after re-districting in 1973, he represented Deschutes and Klamath counties.\\"Oregon Legislative Assembly Legislators and Staff 1841-2005\\", Oregon State Archives (Tim Backer, Reference Archivist), Oregon Secretary of State, February 2006.

Among the many institutions that have benefited from the foundation are the High Desert Museum, Oregon Historical Society, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, and Lewis and Clark College. Perhaps Sam Johnson's greatest legacy was preserving the headwaters of the Metolius River, also known as Metolius Springs. The headwaters are just north of Black Butte, and are unusual because the Metolius River emerges from an underground volcanic lava tubes as a full flowing river. For many years, the Johnsons allowed public access to the scenic headwaters viewing area. The Johnsons gave the Metolius Springs viewing site to the United States Forest Service in 1965.

He was the son of Rukn al-Din Mahmud.  Biography  'Izz al-Din was appointed as malik by the notables of Sistan in 1352 after the death of Jalal al-Din Mahmud. Soon after his ascension, a conflict broke out between him and his cousin Muhammad ibn Nusrat al-Din Muhammad, who was governor of the town of Uq and commanded a large degree of support in northern Sistan. Muhammad rebuilt several fortresses and seized crown lands in his locality. Civil war quickly erupted, during which the canals and agricultural fields of Sistan were damaged and famine became a serious problem. In the midst of this war 'Izz al-Din granted refuge in 1363/1364 to Timur Barlas, who had recently been expelled from Transoxiana. In 'Izz al-Din's later years popular discontent began to grow against his vizier Muhammad 'Ata'. The opposition was soon joined by 'Izz al-Din's son, Qutb al-Din. One day, while the malik was on a hunting trip, a Shahr-i Sistan mob overran the citadel and killed the vizier. Qutb al-Din and his supporters then battled 'Izz al-Din's forces and defeated them. The malik was captured and exiled. 'Izz al-Din, intent on recovering his throne, made his way to Herat and gained the support of the Kartid malik Giyath al-Din Pir 'Ali. Together with the malik of Farah, Iksandar ibn Inaltigin, 'Izz al-Din and a Kartid force invaded Sistan in the spring of 1380. Qutb al-Din, seeing many of his supporters abandon him, decided to flee, enabling 'Izz al-Din to retake Shahr-i Sistan. Qutb al-Din, however, was invited by several nobles and military commanders to return; upon doing so he defeated 'Izz al-Din and Iksandar and forced them to leave Sistan. At this point 'Izz al-Din's desire to maintain his rule weakened; he returned to Sistan and renounced the throne in favor of his son. He died two years later, in 1382.  References  * Bosworth, C.E.

It was first performed in 1978 and reported in 1984. Procedure Technically it is very similar to the Bidirectional Glenn procedure used to direct half the body's venous blood flow into the lungs. However, in patients with interrupted IVC, most of the blood from the lower body actually joins the blood from the upper body before returning to the heart via the superior vena cava (SVC). Therefore, the redirection of SVC blood to the lungs (as in the Glenn) results in much more than half the venous blood flow being diverted. After Kawashima, the only de-oxygenated blood returning to the heart is from the abdominal organs (via the hepatic veins). As a result, there is much less hypoxia than after Glenn, and the heart is pumping less additional blood than after Glenn. However, the hypoxia can worsen over time (because of the development of microscopic AVMs in the lungs that allow blood to pass through without being oxygenated), and therefore these children still may need a complete Fontan procedure in the end.

The earliest section of the building, the rear kitchen wing, was built in 1822. The main section of the house was added a few decades later and is two and a half floors. The entire structure is constructed of handmade brick with a smooth stucco plaster over the exterior. History The house had its beginnings in 1822 as Mobile's first courthouse and city jail, and was built between the southern bastions of Fort Cond√©. The fort itself was in the process of being demolished at the time. In 1849 the site was purchased by Jonathan Kirkbride from Mount Holly in New Jersey and the old courthouse and jail were converted into a kitchen wing, attached to the newly built main house.Hammond, Ralph. Ante-Bellum Mansions of Alabama., page 172. New York: Architectural Book Publishers, 1951. The residence would remain in the Kirkbride family until 1905, when it was purchased by B. J. Bishop. The site was purchased by the Historic Mobile Preservation Society in 1940 and a partial restoration was undertaken. It was during this time that the outlines of four of the old jail cells were discovered in the kitchen wing. The restoration would later be completed by The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America. Description Conde‚ÄìCharlotte House in 1936 The house was originally built in the Federal style and was later altered to reflect the Greek Revival style. It has a two-story portico on the front elevation featuring brick Doric columns on the lower level and wooden Corinthian columns on the upper level. The house is wide at the front southern elevation, long at the eastern elevation, and long at the western elevation, including the carriage house. The ground floor is high from floor to ceiling and the upper story is high. The overall structure is brick with stucco, with the front upper portico, rear galleries, and trim in wood. Urban renewal Bloodgood's Row on Monroe Street before demolition The Conde‚ÄìCharlotte house and its surroundings became isolated from the rest of the city with the construction of Interstate 10 and urban renewal. Most of the surrounding neighborhood, one of the oldest in Mobile, was demolished to make way for the interstate project. The most notable section of the neighborhood that was destroyed was the early multi-storied townhouses of Bloodgood's Row along Monroe Street. The new construction left only a small one block section of Theatre, Monroe, and Saint Emanuel streets intact afterward, surrounded by a circle of interstate and its associated entrance and exit ramps. With the foundations of Fort Cond√© being discovered during tunnel construction, a replica fort was rebuilt on the old site after the George Wallace Tunnel was finished. The fort is now a backdrop to the Conde‚ÄìCharlotte house. In recent years the city has made attempts to develop this area into \\"Fort Cond√© Village\\", which has seen the relocation and restoration of period appropriate buildings and the addition of brick streets and gas street lamps.

The town is inhabited by the Karrayyu Oromo, Afar and Somali Dir clans (Issa and Gadabuursi).  History  Visitors to the area in the first decades of the 20th century frequently described the area as land between the Karrayyu Oromo, Afar, Somali Dir clans (Issa and Gadabuursi) and Amhara.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 3 January 2008) Somali settlers from the Dir clans of the Issa and Gadabuursi migrated to this region towards the end of the era of Emperor Menelek II of Ethiopia. Later their numbers increased as relatives and kinsmen took permanent settlement there. On the eve of the Italian invasion, a German named Neitzel had been granted a concession to cultivate cotton and coffee.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 209 Despite that, few people lived in the area until the arrival of the Dutch corporation Handelsvereeningung Amsterdam (HVA), which established a factory to process sugar at Metehara, after it had been expelled from Indonesia in 1954. In 1970, the Karrayyu Oromo staged an armed demonstration in Metehara which destroyed fences and buildings at the HVA plantation. The Derg announced 3 February 1975 that the sugar plantation, including the Dutch investments, would be fully nationalized. During the 2002 drought, a Karrayyu Oromo leader was killed in Metehara, which increased tensions between the Karrayyu Oromo and Afar peoples. As a result the Afar, who traded at the Tuesday market, did not go to the market during that drought.\\"Afar: insecurity and delayed rains threaten livestock and people\\" UN- Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia, July 2002, p. 4  Demographics  Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Metehara has an estimated total population of 21,348 of whom 10,763 were men and 10,585 were women.CSA 2005 National Statistics , Table B.4 The 1994 national census reported this town had a total population of 11,934 of whom 5,837 were males and 6,097 were females.

As a troubadour he wrote six surviving tensos, four with Lanfranc Cigala, one incomplete with Jacme Grils, and another with a certain Alberto. He was the son of a Perceval Doria, but not the Perceval Doria who was also a troubadour and probably his cousin. Identification A Simon Doria is first recorded in 1253 at Tunis, carrying money and gold cloth. In 1254 and 1256 he is recorded as the husband of a Contessina, sister of Giacomino, of the house of the margraves of Gavi. In 1257 he accepted some money in mutuum. In 1267 he was absent from Genoa and represented there by a proxy. He was dead by 13 March 1275. Obviously a banker or merchant, this Simon is difficult to identify with the troubadour. It is more probable that the troubadour was the Simon Doria who appears as an ambassador to Ceuta in a treaty of 6 September 1262. He was podest√† of Savona in 1265-1266\\\\. He would then be one of many such podest√†-troubadours of which the 13th century furnishes examples, many from Genoa. On 13 January 1265 this Simon was sent as an ambassador to Genoa to request Tommaso Malocello as the future podest√† of Savona. In 1267 he was in Genoa again, and on 8 July he signed a document ratifying the peace between the Genoese and the Knights Templar under Thomas Berard. This Simon is last mentioned in 1293 when he was named podest√† of Albenga. A certain Simon Doria was in possession of a galley at Genoa in 1311. This was probably not the troubadour, but rather the same Simon as he who was ambassador to the pope in 1271 or 1281. There are thus probably three Simons of the Doria family. It is impossible to perfectly distinguish them, but the tenso with Alberto must have been written before 1250, based on a reference to the Emperor Frederick II in line 40, so the mid-century ambassador-podest√† is most likely. The ship-owner of 1311 is almost impossible. Works The tenso with Jacme Grils is preserved in two manuscripts: troubadour MS \\"O\\", which is a 14th-century Italian work on parchment, now \\"Latin 3208\\" in the Biblioteca Vaticana in Rome; and a1, an Italian paper manuscript from 1589, now in the Biblioteca Estense in Modena.

Life  Before he came to Strasbourg in the beginning of the 1440s, Heinrich Eggestein had already acquired the academic degree of a Magister artium liberalium at a university which is still unknown. Already shortly after his arrival, he entered the service of Bishop Rupert of Palatinate- Simmern and held the office of Siegelbewahrer (keeper of the seal, also called Insiegler or Siegeltr√§ger) at the Strasbourg provost court, which he lost again in 1455. In 1461, this office was again given to him and three years later, he finally lost it. He got the rights of a Strasbourg citizen in 1442. It is assumed that Eggestein became personally acquainted with Johannes Gutenberg, the later inventor of printing books with movable type, during his stay in Strasbourg in the 1440s and that he was able to form a lasting bond with him. It is highly likely that Eggestein even travelled to Mainz himself in the 1450s to learn the art of book printing from Gutenberg. When this was and how long the stay lasted cannot be definitely resolved, due to sketchy source materials. holds the view that Eggestein was already in Mainz in 1454 and that might be why he lost the office of Siegelbewahrer in Strasbourg in 1455. If this were the case, then he could have watched the printing of the 42-line-per-page Gutenberg Bible firsthand. Geldner further suspects that Heinrich Eggestein actively participated in the typesetting and printing of the T√ºrkenkalender, which was completed in the middle of December in 1454.Geldner: Inkunabelkunde. p. 221 He did not give up his Strasbourg citizen's rights until August 1457, however. If he had left Alsace so late, he would have admittedly arrived in Mainz after the break between Gutenberg and Johann Fust. Heinrich Eggestein's return to Strasbourg is certainly verified, as he again got the rights of citizenship on 9 August 1459. However, it is not known whether and in what way Eggestein might have participated in the printing shop operated by Johannes Metelin in Strasbourg. It is indisputable, however, that the two men knew each other and had a close relationship. It is even thought to be possible that Mentelin and Eggestein swore to keep their knowledge of the art of book printing a secret, through an agreement which has unfortunately not been preserved. The decision to found his own printery may have been made in the time around 1464, when Eggestein lost his office of Siegelbewahrer for the second time, possibly in connection with the setting up of the Offizin (an old German term for a book printery). On 31 March 1466 the printer received a Schutzbrief of the Elector Frederick I of the Palatinate, giving him special protection, somewhat like a patent. His first larger work is considered to be a Latin Bible, which must have been produced before 24 May 1466. Although his printery was quickly able to establish itself in the market, Heinrich Eggestein got into financial difficulties towards the end of the 1470s. He was indebted to the Basel paper merchant, Anton Galliciani, and was successfully sued by him in 1480 for the immediate payment of all outstanding debts. On 24 April 1483 Eggestein finally gave up his rights as a citizen of Strasbourg. The last printed works which were made by him or with his type were popular prints. He was no longer mentioned after 1488. The date and circumstances of his death are unknown.  Work  Heinrich Eggestein's activities as a book printer can be established from 1464 until 1488. During these 25 years, he published a wealth of printed works with varied content. After his first work, the Bible of 1466 which has already been mentioned, he printed two further Latin folio editions of the Holy Scriptures. In this connection, the Strasbourg printer also used modern marketing methods. Eggestein's book advertisement of 1468/70, which promoted his third edition of the Bible, is considered to be the oldest pamphlet of this kind, along with the advertisements of Mentelin and Sch√∂ffer. At the beginning of the 1470s, he began to expand his printing and publishing range. Besides theological works, Eggestein now increasingly printed legal works of canon and civil law, such as the Decretum Gratiani (1471), as well as the Decretales of Gregory IX and the Constitutiones of Pope Clement V. That put him in direct competition with Peter Sch√∂ffer, who also issued legal titles in on a large scale. Furthermore, Heinrich Eggestein printed antique classics (e.g., Virgil's Bucolica, Cicero's De officiis or Julius Caesar's De bello gallico), but directed his special interest to Latin works of Medieval authors. Thus he published the Legenda aurea of Jacobus de Voragine, De miseria conditionis humanae by Pope Innocent III, as well as works by Bonaventura and Bernhard von Clairvaux, among others. German language titles were quite rare in his range. An important exception to that is the second German Bible, based on the , which Eggestein published in 1470. Further vernacular titles were Lucius Apuleius' The Golden Ass (Translator: Niklas von Wyle) and an edition of Belial.  Literature  In German * P. Amelung: Heinrich Eggestein. In.

He joined hard rock group The Screaming Jets from 1993 to 2001. From 2001 to 2005, he relocated to the United States and was a member of American band, Cinderglass. By 2005, he had returned to Australia and set up a music school Rosies's School of Rock in Newcastle focusing on performance & band coaching for kids. His portrait, Rock and role model by Peter Sesselmann, was entered for the 2009 Archibald Prize. In 2017 Rosevear won the Newcastle Heat of the Real Estate Institute of NSW Auctioneering Competition and is the host of lifestyle program Location Living Lifestyle on Network Nine. Biography Craig Rosevear started his musical career with the Sydney Youth Orchestra, before becoming lead drummer for 5 years with the Newcastle Combined High Schools Marching Band, or The Marching Koalas. He was also percussionist with the Broadmeadow High School Concert Band. In 1990, he joined Sydney-based hard rock bands Angry Snuff Puppett and then BB Steal. With BB Steal, he recorded their debut full-length album, On the Edge, which was released in 1991. They supported Def Leppard on the Australian leg of their 1992 tour. Rosevear joined rock group, The Screaming Jets, in July 1993. He was the permanent replacement for founding drummer, Brad Heaney who had been sacked in April and was temporarily filled-in by United Kingodom's Dave Holland (ex-Judas Priest) for the last leg of their European tour. The band supported Def Leppard and Ugly Kid Joe on their tour of United States. They returned to Australia in late 1993 and released a single, \\"Helping Hand\\" from their previous album, Tear of Thought (1992, before Rosevear had joined). With Rosevear, they recorded their third studio album, The Screaming Jets, which was released in August 1995 with the related single, \\"Friend of Mine\\" appearing in November. The album peaked at No. 5 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart. They followed with World Gone Crazy in August 1997, which reached the top 20 and compilation album, Hits and Pieces in November 1999, which also peaked in the top 20. Rosevear left The Screaming Jets by 2000 and was replaced by Col Hatchman (ex-Hang Seng). Rosevear briefly played for Newcastle band, DV8 with Greg Bryce and Mark Middleton. In 2001, Rosevear moved to the US, where he played with Albanian singer Simaku and then joined US band Cinderglass. After the demise of Cinderglass he returned to Newcastle and resumed playing with DV8 and also played with The Retro Rockets. In 2005 he set up his own music school called \\"Rosie's School of Rock\\" inspired from some of the Rock Schools he saw in USA. The school provides tuition on all Rock instruments and hosts concerts every term. The school's core aim is to provide a learning environment that creates confidence in kids by enabling them to create a 'cooler' image for themselves, including kids with disabilities. Many students form bands, perform, make and promote albums, get on radio and TV. With Retro Rockets, Rosevear released a third album, Cars, Guitars and Girls from Mars in 2007. In 2009, Peter Sesselmann's portrait of Rosevear was entered into the Archibald Prize as Rock and role model and was \\"symbolic of the rock drummer's transition from touring musician to educator over the past few years\\". In 2011, DV8 released a live album, Live at the Wicko.

The song was first recorded by The Robins the same year. That recording was one of the first R&B; hits to use sound effects and employed a Muddy Waters stop-time riff as the instrumental backing. Lyrics The song's setting takes place at a correctional facility. A man is serving his prison sentence for armed robbery. At 4:00 AM on July 2, 1953, he wakes up to a very alarming disturbance; a jail riot. It started in cell block #4 and continued through the prison hall from cell to cell. The jailhouse warden, armed with a Thompson sub machine gun, threatens to execute all the prisoners if the riot doesn't stop soon, but one of them, Scarface Jones, retaliates by carrying dynamite. Forty-seven hours later, 3:00 AM on July 4, 1953, the prison security let loose tear gas on the inmates and they return to their cells. Cover versions The song has been covered by many cross-genre artists such as The Grateful Dead, Wanda Jackson, Vicki Young, Johnny Winter, Dr. Feelgood, The Blues Brothers, Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen, Johnny Cash, and Flat Duo Jets. The Beach Boys reworked the song as \\"Student Demonstration Time\\" for the 1971 album Surf's Up. The Beach Boys originally covered the song for their 1965 album Beach Boys' Party! but it was never released until they put a version on their 2011 album Live & Alternative Songs. It was also translated and performed in French by Michel Pagliaro as \\"√âmeute dans la Prison\\" (Riot in the Prison). In his version it was July 13, 1968, at 4:00 am and originated in cell block #3. It was later covered by Eric Lapointe.

Located in the Debub Wollo Zone of the Amhara Region, this town has a latitude and longitude of . From the 1870s, Were Ilu had a Thursday market. The Medhane Alem church, dating from at least from the early 1900s, is a notable local landmark. Empress Zewditu was born at Were Ilu, and Ras Habte Maryam was buried there.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 3 January 2008) Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, this town has an estimated total population of 10,062 of whom 4,942 were men and 5,120 were women.CSA 2005 National Statistics, Table B.4 The 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 5,809 of whom 2,600 were males and 3,209 were females. It is the largest of three towns in Were Ilu woreda.  History  While still ruler of Shewa, Menelik II had a ketamma (or fortified camp) built at Were Ilu and Enewari in 1868 to guard his northern frontier and pacify the Wollo Oromo, who were his neighbors. In September of the following year, after Menelik had recaptured Maqdala, the Wollo chiefs came to Were Ilu at the Mesqel feast to make formal submission and take an oath of fealty to the king and to Muhammad Ali, whom Menelik had appointed governor of Wollo.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 40. During the 1870s, Menelik resided at Were Ilu for extended periods. However, while the ruler of Shewa campaigned in Gojjam in early 1877, a rebellion caused by the intrigues of his consort Baffana led to Were Ilu being sacked and burned, and forced Menelik to return to Shewa.Marcus, Menelik II, pp. 54ff. Emperor Yohannes IV met with Menelik twice at Were Ilu: the first time in 1878 to accept his fealty; and a second time in 1882 to discipline him for disturbing the peace of Yohannes' realm by fighting with Negus Tekle Haymanot the Battle of Embabo.Marcus, Menelik II, pp. 70f. After Menelik became Emperor of Ethiopia and moved his capital south to Addis Ababa, Were Ilu declined somewhat in importance. Writing in the 1890s, Augustus B. Wylde described the Were Ilu market, held on Saturdays, as very large in size, with petty European goods and locally made cloth available;Augustus B. Wylde, Modern Abyssinia (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 494 upon visiting its market, he was impressed by the large piles of woolen goods for sale there, declaring that it \\"may be called the Bradford of Abyssinia\\".Wylde, Modern Abyssinia, p. 391 In 1895 Were Ilu became a supply dump, where the emperor stored about one and a half million cartridges and thousands of guns, as well as setting up numerous granaries,Chris Proutky, Empress Taytu and Menilek II: Ethiopia 1883-1910 (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1986), p. 132 and it served as an organizing point for Menelik's army at the beginning of the First Italo-Abyssinian War.Proutky, Empress Taytu, p. 139. Although its location led to the telegraph line the Italians constructed between 1902 and 1904 from Asmara south to Addis Ababa passing through the town and giving it a local telegraph office, Were Ilu was connected north to Molale by only a trail as late as 1962. Branches of the telegraph line led from Were Ilu east to Ankober and west to Gondar through Debre Tabor.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University, 1968), p. 340 On 28 March 1990, during the Ethiopian Civil War, an aerial attack on Were Ilu by Derg airplanes destroyed a grain stockpile, but inflicted no casualties.Africa Watch Report, Ethiopia: \\"Mengistu has Decided to Burn Us like Wood\\": Bombing of Civilians and Civilian Targets by the Air Force, 24 July 1990 In June 2002, some people were relocated from Were Ilu, north to Badme.

She was commissioned in 1941 for minesweeping and anti-submarine roles. Tui was the first of two ships with this name to serve in the Royal New Zealand Navy and was named after a native bird from New Zealand. War service In March 1942 in Scotland, Tui and the four Isles class trawlers, Killegray, Inchkeith, Sanda and Scarba had been newly built for New Zealand. They were formed into a flotilla and departed from the River Clyde with a convoy bound for Canada. The trawler flotilla then left for Auckland, arriving there in August. In Auckland, Tui was assigned to the 25th Minesweeping Flotilla and sailed for Suva to replace Matai. In December she joined her sister ships Kiwi and Moa at Noum√©a. The 25th Minesweeping Flotilla had been offered to COMSOPAC, and by early December Tui, Moa, and Kiwi with Matai as flotilla leader, were all together at Noum√©a ready to move north. They sailed for the Solomons, escorting a convey some of the way. Making Tulagi their base they began anti-submarine screen patrols on 19 December 1942 off Tulagi and Lunga Point, Guadalcanal. =Landing barges= On 21 January 1943, Tui and Moa came across four Japanese landing barges stopped close inshore. When Tui and Moa closed in, those aboard the barges opened fire with machine guns and small arms, and got under way. At close range Moa fired on the leading barge, but a fluke shot passed through the 4-inch gun aperture, ignited a cordite charge and injured all seven in the gun crew. Moa managed to silence the first barge and sink the last in line with 20mm fire, then withdrew and attended to the cordite fire and injuries. Tui then opened fire on the barges, sinking one with her 4-inch gun, and the remaining two escaped inshore in the darkness.Waters, Sydney David (1956) The Royal New Zealand Navy, Page 309-310, Official History, Historical Publications Branch, Wellington. =Submarine I-17= On 19 August 1943, while escorting a convoy from Noumea, Tui picked up a submarine contact. She made an initial run over it without using depth charges, a second run dropping two depth charges, and a third run throwing another two depth charges. Contact was lost and Tui signaled some US seaplanes who joined the search. A plane indicated that Tui should investigate smoke on the horizon. The submarine was sighted on the surface and Tui opened fire at maximum range, scoring one and possibly two hits. Aircraft then dropped depth charges and the submarine sank at . She was the Japanese submarine I-17, 2,190 tons, 108m long, built in 1939. Ninety-seven crewmen were lost. Tui picked up six survivors who said that Tui's depth charge attacks had damaged the submarine and forced it to the surface. The commanding officer and anti- submarine control officer on the Tui had doubted whether the contact was really a submarine, so the depth-charge attacks were not properly carried out. A later Naval Board report concluded that \\"had the proper procedure been followed and a full depth-charge pattern fired in the original attack, there is little doubt but that the submarine would have been destroyed then and there.\\"Waters, Sydney David (1956) The Royal New Zealand Navy, Page 327-328, Official History, Historical Publications Branch, Wellington. I-17 was the first Axis ship to shell the United States mainland when she shelled an oil refinery near Santa Barbara on 23 February 1942. =Other service= COMSOPAC released the New Zealand ships in June 1945, and Tui departed the Solomons escorting a group of six RNZN Fairmiles. On her return to Auckland, Tui worked with Kiwi and the 7th Trawler Group on the final clearing of the German minefield in the outer Hauraki Gulf. Post-war service Tui was put in reserve in June 1946. =Training= In 1952 the Navy wanted to free some Loch class frigates for war service in Korea. Tui was recommissioned in February 1952 to take over training duties previously undertaken by the frigate Kaniere. This training was carried out for the Naval Volunteer Reserve and included training for compulsory reservists as well as volunteer reservists and sea cadets. She was also used part-time by the DSIR and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). =Oceanographic research= In October 1955 Tui was docked for conversion to an oceanographic research ship. On 5 March 1956, the now disarmed Tui was recommissioned and reclassified as a fleet auxiliary. She made many scientific cruises for the DSIR and NRL to places around New Zealand and Pacific islands. She investigated shipwrecks, notably MV Holmglen off Timaru in 1959 and MV Kaitawa off Cape Reinga in 1966. =Her fate= Tui was finally decommissioned on 22 December 1967. She was stripped of her equipment and sold in December 1969 to Pacific Scrap Ltd who demolished her. She was replaced in 1970 by a purpose built oceanographic ship with the same name.

Leadership The group was led by Mario Rossi, an animal embalmer, and Augusto Viel, an electronics technician. Mario Rossi was a former communist who wanted to unite the workers of Italy to prevent the return of fascism. Mario Rossi created the October 22 Group to unite workers after seeing their struggles in his everyday life. He was inspired by the numerous worker riots in the 1960s that occurred at the factory he worked at in Milan. He spread his ideals to his friends and that was the basis of the October 22 Group. Others in the group were former members of the Italian Communist Party who left because they were dissatisfied with the groups inability to enact change within the government The October 22 Group never expanded outside of Genoa and was only active for a short time. They would eventually expand to about a dozen total members who all wanted to enact change within their government. The group was named by the media because of a ticket found in Mario Rossi‚Äôs pocket when he was arrested after a failed robbery attempt that ended in murder. Its political approach was Marxist‚ÄìLeninist but among its members were also petty criminals and even a fascist, Diego Vandelli, enrolled in the MSI and police informer. Ideology The October 22 Group was inspired by left-wing, anti-fascist, and Maoist ideology. The group did not explicitly want to overthrow the government and their only clearly defined goal was to organize the working class. Attacks The October 22 Group had a variety of targets including private citizens, private property, and particularly government property. Most of their attacks were not fatal. Like most Italian left-wing organizations, the movement used dynamite as their weapon of choice in their attacks. Of all the group‚Äôs targets, private citizens were the most frequently targeted, including the abduction and ransom of the son of a wealthy citizen of Genoa. This was the first kidnapping done by an Italian leftist group and was successful. In 1970, Mario Rossi organized the abduction of Sergio Gadolla, son of a rich Genoa family, as a way of financing. From the action, the gang gained a 200 million liras ransom; most of the money, however, was raked off by Vandelli, who had acted as middleman. By then, the kidnapping was generally attributed by the press to the city's underworld. On 26 March 1971, Rossi and Viel robbed a security officer who transported the wages for the Genoa Public Housing Institute‚Äôs dependents. A delivery man of the Institute, Alessandro Floris, tried bravely to stop the two raiders and was shot by Rossi. Floris was the first victim of the Italian red terrorism. (Later, Rossi has always denied firing to kill.) A passerby took a photo the moment when Rossi, on a scooter driven by Viel, pointed his gun against the body of Floris, lying on the ground in a pool of blood. The image, besides becoming a symbol of the years of lead, helped to identify the killer, who was captured the same day, after a long chase in the city‚Äô's streets. Propaganda and Grievances Along with attacking symbolic targets of state power and capitalism, like the United States consulate. The group spread their anti-fascist propaganda by hijacking radio or television transmissions and the members distributed pamphlets. The group used guerilla warfare in an urban setting to respond to grievances they had using a manual written by a revolutionary from Brazil as their guide. Originally they planned to do the guerilla warfare in the mountains but decided on an urban setting. One example of the group responding to a grievance they had was when the group bombed an oil refinery to protest high gas prices at the time with no fatalities. Downfall and Dissolution The October 22 Group was only active for about two years before it disbanded due to the accidental murder of security officer Alessandro Floris by Mario Rossi. His arrest led the authorities to the group‚Äôs warehouse where their revolutionary writings weapons were discovered. After the Rossi's arrest, the group was quickly disbanded in 1971. The group's trial took place in 1973: Rossi received a life sentence, the other members of the group received a combined 180 years of prison. The public prosecutor was Mario Sossi, a judge notorious for his intransigence and his right-wing ideas. In 1974, Mario Sossi himself was kidnapped by the Red Brigades. The terrorist group asked, in exchange of the judge‚Äôs life, the freedom and the expatriation to a communist country of Mario Rossi and the other members of the XXII October. The Genoa Assizes gave in to blackmail and ordered the eight prisoners‚Äô release, but the give-and-take was immediately stopped by the Ministry of Interior Paolo Emilio Taviani and by the Genoa General Procurator Francesco Coco. Three days later, Sossi was freed, without counterparts. The Red Brigades in 1978 demanded the release of three of the October 22 members from prison in exchange for the release of Italian prime minister Aldo Moro, whom the Red Brigades had captured and later executed. The October 22 Group members who did not receive life were absorbed by The Red Brigades after the October 22 Groups collapse. In the 1980s, after the end of the wave of terrorism, the members of the gang were gradually set free. Mario Rossi alone got bail only in 1990 and was definitively released in 2002.

The exact date of the paintings creation is not known, but it is signed and dated to 1820 by Luny, four years after the events depicted.  Background  The painting is a portrayal of the Bombardment of Algiers, which took place on 27 August 1816. This campaign was an attempt by the British to end the slavery conducted by the Dey of Algiers, specifically to free the hundreds of Christians that had been enslaved by the Dey. It was the result of the Dey's rejection of previous non-combative negotiations to free these slaves.Fremont, Gregory - The Wars of the Barbary Pirates: To the Shores of Tripoli: The Rise of the US Navy and Marines. Osprey Publishing, 2006. . The two forces stated in their earlier negotiations that they would not fire the first shot. However, despite the Algerian's plan to board Exmouth's ships in secrecy using small ships, an Algerian ship fired out of line at approximately 3:00 pm, and the Algerian plan was foiled and the battle instigated.Chambers, William; Chambers, Robert - Chambers's Edinburgh Journal. Published 1845. After around ten hours, the Algerian fleet were effectively overpowered and subdued by Exmouth's fleet of approximately 28 ships. Following effective victory, Exmouth dispatched a peace treaty the next day at noon, under the condition that the opposition comply to the terms specified. He expressly stated that if the terms were not agreed with and met, that the combative action would continue. The Dey accepted these terms. However, Exmouth had taken a sizable risk by demanding acceptance by force, because the fleet had actually fired off all of its ammunition.Lowenheim, Oded - Predators and Parasites: Persistent Agents of Transnational Harm and Great Power Authority. University of Michigan Press, 2007. About a month later, on 24 September, a treaty was signed and sanctioned. This resulted in the freeing of over 1000 Christian slaves, among other things.  Analysis  The painting is a seascape, as the majority of Luny's works were. It specifically depicts a scene of the bombardment wherein British victory is evidently close. Night has fallen, so it would have been several hours into the assault. Many of Exmouth's ships are seen in the middleground, launching their attack on the shoreline defences. In the foreground, there are several small ships, presumably the Algerian boats that were to be employed in the boarding of Exmouth's ships. Far in the background, the silhouette of mountains behind the port, and the clouded night sky can be seen. Little of the actual port can be seen, as it is shrouded by the billowing smoke. The only source of lighting in the painting comes from the towering inferno in the approximate centre of the piece, behind Exmouth's ships. In the darkness of the night and the long shadows, it creates a Chiaroscuro effect, introducing stark contrast between light and dark. This is accentuated by the pure blackness that surrounds the scene from all sides. This effect is also seen in some of Luny's other paintings, most similarly in his Battle of the Nile.

Much of the island is within the borders of the Amami Gunt≈ç National Park. Geography Yoronjima is the southernmost of the Amami Islands and is located approximately north of Hedo Point, the northernmost point of Okinawa Island, and south of the southern tip of Kyushu. The island is an elevated coralline island with a highest point above sea level. The coast of the island is surrounded by a coral reef. Climate Yoronjima has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa) with very warm summers and mild winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is somewhat lower in winter. The island is subject to frequent typhoons. History It is uncertain when Yoron Island was first settled. It was ruled by the Aji nobility from the 8th century onwards. From 1266 it was part of the Hokuzan Kingdom until its incorporation into the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1416. The samurai force from Satsuma Domain went around Yoron on their way to Okinawa during the 1609 Invasion of Ryukyu, after which its incorporation into the official holdings of that domain was recognized by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1624. Satsuma rule was harsh, with the inhabitants of the island reduced to serfdom and forced to raise sugar cane to meet high taxation, which often resulted in famine. After the Meiji Restoration the island was incorporated into ≈åsumi Province and later became part of Kagoshima Prefecture. Following World War II, along with the other Amami Islands, it was occupied by the United States until 1953, at which time it reverted to the control of Japan. Economy When Okinawa was governed by the United States, Yoronjima was the southernmost island Japanese mainlanders could go to for vacation, and it became a tourist spot. Tourism is still a large part of the local economy, with numerous resorts offering water sports and other activities. With moderate rainfall and a warm climate, the island is suitable for agriculture. Main crops include sweet potatoes, sugar cane and floriculture. Brown sugar refining and the production of distilled sh≈çch≈´ liquor and vinegar and sea salt are also major industries. Transportation Yoron Airport (IATA: RNJ; ICAO: RORY) serves travelers to and from the island. Japan Air Commuter flies to Kagoshima and Okinoerabu Airports, and Ryukyu Air Commuter provides service to Naha Airport. Ships on the Marix and A Line Lines operate between Yoron Port and Kagoshima, Amami ≈åshima, and other local destinations, as well as Kobe and Osaka. Culture The island still maintains close ties to Okinawan culture, with Eisa, a kind of Okinawa drumming and dancing style, popular for festivals such as the Sango Matsuri (Coral Festival), held every August. Okinawa patterns and styles of dress are also more common than that of mainland Japan. Another difference from mainland Japan are cultural religious practices. Mainland Japanese practice both Shintoism and Buddhism, but the native culture of Yoron does not include many of the Buddhist elements seen on the mainland, and both weddings and funerals are practiced in the ancient Shinto tradition. Islanders still celebrate many ancient practices and festivals, with costumes and descriptions on display at the Yoron Museum, including a replica of a traditional village, complete with thatched-roof huts, tools, palm-leaf textiles and other items on display. Thatched-roof huts still exist in use throughout the island. A unique cultural practice is Yoron Kenpo, which includes formalized speeches along with the consumption of sugar- based sh≈çch≈´ as an offering to the gods. This practice dates back to the Muromachi Period of Japanese history. Some Yoron people continue to speak their own language, Yunnu futuba (Yoron language), a dialect of the Ryukyuan languages. Its basic grammar is similar to Japanese language, however, Yunnu Futuba has a wider range of sounds and an even stricter system of hierarchy for speech, with respectful suffixes and prefixes for elders and men being an integral part of the grammar and syntax of the language. Most young adults can still speak Yunnu Futuba but children no longer learn the language or do not learn fluency, as standard Japanese is spoken at school and at work. Local attractions Yoron has a number of beaches, including Yuri and Sunset, and its white beaches are famous throughout Japan. It is also the home of Pricia Resort, a popular location for Japanese people on holiday. References *Eldridge, Mark. The Return of the Amami Islands: The Reversion Movement and U.S.-Japan Relations.

She also carried minesweeping equipment and 40 depth charges for anti-submarine operations. Operational history Commissioned into the Royal New Zealand Navy on 12 August 1941, Moa was the first of two vessels with this name to serve in the RNZN and was named after a native bird from New Zealand. On 29 January 1943, in concert with her sister ship , Moa helped to ram and wreck the . At the time Moa was under the command of Lieutenant Commander Peter Phipps, later to become a vice admiral. In February 1943, Moa participated in Operation Cleanslate, the occupation of the Russell Islands. However, when the Moa put the forces ashore, local natives informed them that the Japanese had left ten days before. On 7 April 1943 Moa was refuelling from the at Tulagi Harbor when Japanese aircraft attacked. The Moa sustained a direct hit from a 500-pound bomb and was damaged by two near misses. She sank bow first within about four minutes. At some point after the I-1 sank, the Moa crew acquired and mounted a 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun, which the crew used against their attackers before they sank. Five ratings were killed and seven were seriously wounded, including Phipps.

It is owned by the City of Augusta and operated by the General Aviation Commission. This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. History=Origins= The origins of Daniel Field begin in 1924, when the City of Augusta leased for an airport and a municipal golf course. About 35,000 people attended the airport's dedication on October 29, 1927. Against the mayor's wishes, the city council named the airport Daniel Field, for mayor Raleigh Daniel, who was a major proponent of the city leasing the land in the early 1920s. On December 1, 1931, Eastern Air Transport began passenger service, but discontinued it five months later due to unprofitability. Eastern resumed service in November 1932 after obtaining a mail contract. The same year, Delta Air Lines began serving Atlanta and Charleston, South Carolina from Augusta. In 1938, the Works Progress Administration began a project that added paved runways, drainage, and other improvements. =World War II= Alarmed by the fall of France in 1940, Congress funded an increase in the strength of the United States Army Air Corps from 29 to 54 combat groups and increased pilot training to 7,000 per year. The quickest way for the Air Corps to obtain additional bases was to utilize existing civil airports. On September 21, 1940, the Air Corps announced a $1.5 million project to build facilities at Daniel Field to support 100 to 110 pursuit aircraft and 2000 men. Because of technicalities in the land transfer, construction did not begin until March 1941. Once begun, a large construction program was needed to turn the civil airport into a military airfield. Construction involved runways and airplane hangars, with three concrete runways, several taxiways and a large parking apron and a control tower. Several large hangars were also constructed. Buildings were ultimately utilitarian and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were constructed of temporary or semi-permanent materials. Although some hangars had steel frames and the occasional brick or tile brick building could be seen, most support buildings sat on concrete foundations but were of frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper Although the Army initially planned on using Daniel for fighter aircraft, it was utilized instead mostly by transport and observation squadrons. This was due to the fact that Daniel's longest runway was a relatively short . The geographical restrictions of ravines to the west and the city of Augusta to the east made the extension of the runways impractical. Oblique airphoto of Daniel Field, about 1944, looking northwest Postcard - Daniel Field Augusta Georgia Initially assigned to the Army Air Corps Southeast Air District, the first units at Daniel Army Airfield the 14th and 15th Transport Squadrons of the 61st Transport Group arrived on July 12, 1941 from Kelly Field, near San Antonio, Texas. The 61st's group headquarters was formed at Olmsted Field, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The squadrons flew C-47 Skytrains, as well as Douglas C-39s, which was the Air Corp's version of the Douglas DC-2. After organizational training and flying a few paratroop operations, the 61st and its squadrons were sent to Lubbock Field in Texas. During the week of October 20, Daniel Field hosted the 40th Pursuit Squadron which came to Daniel Field from Selfridge Field, Michigan which took part in III Interceptor Command exercises, flying P-39 Airacobras With the United States at war in 1942, activity at the airfield expanded dramatically. In early February. Five transport squadrons of the Air Force Combat Command 89th Transport Group, the 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th were activated at Daniel AAF. These squadrons were equipped with C-47s and Douglas DC-3s pressed into military service from the airlines. The 89th stay at Daniel was a short one. Only five weeks later the group moved on to Air Technical Service Command depot at Harding AAF, near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Also during February, three observation squadrons, the 16th, 111th, 122nd, and 154th, arrived from various other bases and forming the Third Air Force 68th Observation Group. Pilots trained on Douglas O-43A, Vultee/Stinson O-49/L-1 Vigilant and Douglas A-20B Havoc aircraft performing antisubmarine patrols along the South Carolina and Georgia coast. On March 2, 1942, the III Air Support Command 313th Transport Group TG and the 29th Transport Squadron were activated at Daniel Field with C-47s. In May, the first tenants of Daniel, the 14th and 15th Transport Squadrons were reassigned to Pope Field, North Carolina to support the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg. On June 15, the 313th Transport Group, activated three additional squadrons, the 47th, 48th, and 49th, out of the 29th TS. One week later, the 313th and its squadrons moved to Bowman Field, near Louisville, Kentucky to support the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell. During July the observation squadrons all transferred to Smith Reynolds Airport, near Winston-Salem, North Carolina for antisubmarine duty. In 1942, newly built Army Airfields were becoming available in the southeast and the Air Force no longer had the need for Daniel Field and its short runways. No other operational units were stationed at Daniel after August 1942. In February 1943, Daniel was reassigned to the Air Technical Service Command, being under the control of the Warner- Robins Air Depot Control Area. The facilities became a repair and replacement depot for Third Air Force aircraft. Most of the military flying at Daniel was by transient aircraft undergoing 3d and 4th echelon heavy maintenance work. Daniel also activated and trained 32 chemical warfare companies. Chemical companies were equipped and taught to use smoke pots, tear gas, chemical trailers, trucks, blasting caps, and how to fill aircraft spray tanks. During the last part of the war, Daniel was used to prepare vehicles for use in the planned Invasion of Japan. In addition, the field had a branch prisoner of war camp with about 1200 POWs working on the field and in the nearby forests. By war's end, the Army's air operations at Daniel were discontinued, with the airfield being returned to full civil control on October 31, 1945. =Postwar use= Throughout the war, Delta Air Lines served the airport with commercial airline service. With the closure of the Air Force's facilities, Daniel Field continued as Augusta's municipal airport. Eastern Air Lines resumed service to Augusta in 1948, later joined by Piedmont Airlines. On July 1, 1950, the airlines shifted their operations to Bush Field and Daniel became a general aviation airport. In 1955, the City moved the two hangars to the eastern side of the airfield. A shopping center was then built on the former ramp area. Today, the only evidence of the Air Force's presence are two hangars. The former cantonment area is now a housing development. Facilities and aircraft Daniel Field covers an area of 146 acres (59 ha) at an elevation of 423 feet (129 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 5/23 is 4,002 by 100 feet (1,220 √ó 30 m) and 11/29 is 3,738 by 100 feet (1,139 √ó 30 m). The remnants of a third runway oriented north-south are clearly visible but have been closed and are marked with yellow Xs or converted to taxiway use. Notably, Daniel Field is some higher in elevation than the commercial Augusta airport, Augusta Regional Airport, as Daniel Field lies above the Piedmont ‚Äì Coastal Plain fall line which descends steeply just south of Daniel Field. Augusta Regional Airport lies along the broad Savannah River floodplain. Daniel Field has two large, fully enclosed hangars and a smaller open shelter. Augusta Aviation is the fixed-base operator (FBO) on the field, offering fuel, parking, hangars, flight instruction, charters, and aircraft repair. For the 12-month period ending July 14, 2010, the airport had 29,000 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 79 per day. At that time there were 48 aircraft based at this airport: 90% single-engine and 10% multi- engine. Airlines Daniel Field does not have regularly scheduled Part 121 Air Carrier service. Augusta Aviation, an on-field FBO, offers charter services as do other local and regional providers. Incidents Daniel Field is located northwest of Augusta‚Äôs commercial airport, Augusta Regional Airport. On the night of February 3, 1986, a Boeing 737-201/Advanced airliner operated by Piedmont Airlines landed on a long Daniel Field runway instead of much longer runway at Augusta Regional Airport as intended. After skidding to a stop still on the runway, the crew and all 106 passengers were unharmed. Augusta Chronicle photos at the time showed passengers disembarking the aircraft at Daniel Field down a Piedmont truck-mounted air stair. An Augusta Chronicle photo appears to identify the aircraft involved as N772N \\"Peninsula Pacemaker\\". Local lore often recounts the flight as being operated by Delta Air Lines and includes stories of the interior being stripped and a special test flight crew being used to fly the aircraft out, though contemporary accounts recorded otherwise.

San Mart√≠n Pajapan Monument 1 is a large Olmec basalt sculpture found on top of the San Martin Pajapan volcano, in the Tuxtla Mountains of the Mexican state of Veracruz. It is notable for its original location and its Olmec iconography. Description Likely carved during the Early Formative period, before 1000 BCE, the 1.4 m (5.5 ft) high statue shows a crouching young lord. Caught in the act of raising a large ceremonial bar, his right hand is under one end and his left over the other end. This pose, nearly identical to that of the \\"twins\\" at El Azuzul, is thought to represent a ruler or shaman (or both) shown in the ritual act of raising the Mesoamerican world tree or axis mundi, an act that establishes the center of the world and connects the earthly plane with the worlds above and below.Pool, p. 118-119 and 143. The plump face is proto-typically Olmec, with \\"no attempt to represent individuality\\".Fuente, p. 162. The young lord wears a huge boxy headdress, the front of which is covered with what is apparently a mask.Diehl, p. 123, or Markham & Markham, p. 20. The mask shows the cleft head, the almond eyes, and the downturned mouth characteristic of the Olmec were-jaguar supernatural, implying that the human had become, or was acting under the authority and/or the protection of, the supernatural.Fuente, p. 162, who refers further to a 1977 publication of hers. Plumes flow backward along the sides of the headdress. From its top, vegetation ‚Äì perhaps maize ‚Äì is sprouting. This were-jaguar mask is identified with the Olmec rain god,Markham and Markham, p. 20. and the iconography and the location of the statue reflect the widespread Mesoamerican belief in mountaintops as the dwelling of rain gods.Pool, p. 123. Archaeological discovery The original location of the San Martin Pajapan Monument 1 in the context of the Olmec heartland. The yellow dots represent ancient habitation sites, while the red dots represent isolated artifact finds unassociated with any ancient town or village.The sculpture was first identified by surveyor Ismael Loya in 1897 and re-discovered by Frans Blom and Oliver La Farge in their expedition of 1925.Blom and La Farge. Located on a platform or \\"level\\" in the saddle between the two highest peaks of volcano's crater rim,Blom and La Farge, p. 46. the statue was found surrounded by broken offering vessels, jade offerings, and numerous other objects, dating from ancient times to the 20th century, indicating it had been an object of veneration for millennia.Diehl, p. 81. These offerings and the statue itself served to identify the San Martin Pajapan mountaintop as a sacred landscape.Pool, p. 123. Although well preserved, the face had been particularly ravaged, perhaps intentionally.Fuente, p. 162. The statue was further damaged in 1897, when Loya broke off part of the arms trying to move it.Blom & LaFarge, p. 45. The statue, except for the face, has since largely been restored. In 1929, Marshall Seville, from the Museum of the American Indian in New York, associated the statue with other unattributed artifacts in various collections, based on stylistic similarities and a common iconography. Since it was unlikely the statue had been moved far since its original site, Seville proposed that this \\"Olmec\\" artistic style (as he referred to it) originated in southern Veracruz.Coe, p. 42.

Synopsis Ramil requests Florinda to help him restore his ancestral home. On their site visit, Florinda relives painful memories she once had there. It seems Ramil's mother, Do√±a Cristina, greatly disapproves of her relationship with the lad, so the old lady persistently sets them apart up until her final breath. Despite his mother‚Äôs refusal, Ramil decides to ask Florinda's hand in marriage. Surprisingly, even from her grave, Do√±a Cristina openly expresses her displeasure. On the day of the wedding, Ramil fails to show up; immediately, Florinda goes in search. With no idea where her groom could have gone, Florinda breaks down. Mother and daughter, Criselda and Mara, finally reach Florinda's new-found home after accepting Ramil's job offer a few days back. Florinda instantly recognizes the Criselda from the past, since the said lady used to serve Ramil's family. On the other hand, upon learning about her sister Florinda's paranormal experiences, Rachelle consults an expert. To her surprise, the professional confirms that there is, in fact, a vengeful spirit residing in their new home. Rachelle‚Äôs friends Gladys and Archie only played a trick on her: The paranormal experience they have encountered is merely an act the two staged. On the other hand, Florinda somehow feels Do√±a Cristina persistently haunting her, but she puts the thought aside. Despite the rather unusual experiences, she continues to go in search for her missing groom, thus making other people think that she is gradually losing her mind. Aware of her sister‚Äôs current state, Rachelle then tries to convince Florinda to undergo psychological treatment. Instead of being thankful for her sister‚Äôs support, Florinda furiously exclaims that she is not ill. Florinda finally grows convinced that there is a bothered spirit residing in her house after Caloy confirmed her story. Immediately, she consults her housemaid Criselda regarding the matter. Aside from Criselda, Florinda also informs Eric; she relays to the policeman all the information she had gathered from Caloy, including the fact that the kid saw Ramil enter the house.

Plot summary 69-year-old Sir Edwin Challoner lives with his extended family in a grand old house in rural Southern England. Unmarried, he has no direct issue, and the person closest to him is his younger brother Hamish, who is also his business associate. Hamish has a wife, Julia, and two sons, Simon, aged 25, and Walter, three years younger, who has dropped out of Oxford to be a poet. When Hamish Challoner dies of a heart condition, Simon prepares to become head of the house, as everyone assumes that it will only be a matter of a few years, if not months, before Sir Edwin also dies. However, the lonely old patriarch surprises them by announcing his impending marriage to their neighbour Rhoda Graham, who is more than 40 years his junior. After the newlyweds have returned from their honeymoon, Simon and Rhoda share a moment of unbridled passion in the old house (\\"Youth and instinct did their work\\"), and Rhoda becomes pregnant. As Sir Edwin and his wife have not had any sex during their brief marriage, there is no doubt as to who has sired the child. However, Sir Edwin decides to be its legal father, and swears Simon, Rhoda, and Walter to secrecy about the paternity of Rhoda's baby. When a healthy boy is born, he names him Hamish in honour of his deceased brother. The implications of this arrangement, ostensibly contrived to keep up appearances, are far-reaching. Suddenly Simon finds himself no longer in a position to inherit his uncle's fortune, which has been the only object of his life ever since he was a child, and he only has himself to blame for it. In addition, he feels that the natural order of things has been turned upside down as now his own son is to precede him as heir to the family estate. When, on top of all that, Sir Edwin asks Julia, Walter and Simon to live elsewhere, the latter feels \\"displaced\\" as well as \\"deposed.\\" It occurs to him that, as a sort of recompense, he might marry Fanny Graham, Rhoda's younger sister, and move into the Grahams' large house, almost empty now, which is conveniently close to the family seat. A few weeks after that, the marriage is announced. Almost two decades later, Simon and Fanny Challoner have five children: Graham, aged 18; Naomi, aged 17; Ralph, 15; and two little ones, three-year-old Claud and two-year-old Emma. They still live in the other house together with Julia and Walter, and Sir Edwin Challoner, now approaching 90, is still alive. Hamish has received a good education and been prepared to inherit both the title and the place from who he believes is his natural father. Simon's line of the family, on the other hand, have been leading rather a modest life, with constant half-serious references to the workhouse as their ultimate dwelling place. Then, another four years later, the past suddenly catches up with the Challoners when Hamish and Naomi announce their intention to get married. It falls to Simon to make a late confession to prevent incest between two of his children. Walter, always the poet, calls his brother \\"the hero of a tragedy. It is a pity you are the villain as well.\\" The one person most profoundly shocked by the revelation is Hamish, who, on an impulse, renounces his heritage (\\"I shall never marry, as I cannot marry Naomi\\") and goes abroad to escape the familial tension and to acquire new perspectives. When Sir Edwin, now aged 94, feels that he is going to die, he calls for his son, and Hamish arrives home on what turns out to be the eve of his father's death. On his deathbed, the old man makes Hamish promise to take his place as head of the house. It does not take long before the family realise that, as far as the inheritance is concerned, Hamish has actually made two conflicting promises, both under emotional stress, and that he will have to break one of them. After the funeral, Hamish surprises the Challoners by presenting to them Marcia, the woman he is going to marry. Describing herself as \\"older and plainer and less poor than I ought to be,\\" Marcia dislikes the old house the moment she sets eyes on it. Said to be easily influenced, especially by his wife, Hamish finally cedes his inheritance to Simon, thus breaking the word he has given his deceased father. Relying on his spouse's financial support, it is now his turn, together with Marcia and his mother, to move out of the house and restore it to Simon, who has always considered it rightfully his. (\\"A few words sent the history of the house into another channel.\\") However, despite the fact that they are now occupying the position which was originally intended for them, Simon and his legitimate children are plagued by thoughts of the future now that the title and the place have been separated. On the one hand, Hamish's unborn children might object to their father having given up his heritage. Also, after Simon's death, it might seem more natural for his oldest son to succeed him, and that would be Hamish again rather than Graham. Ralph sums up these thoughts by remarking that \\"there may be troubles ahead.\\" These deliberations are cut short by the arrival of two telegrams from Marcia informing them that Hamish has died after a short illness‚Äîof a heart condition, just like his grandfather‚Äî, and that she is not pregnant. In the end Rhoda and Marcia, who have decided to keep on living together, return to the neighbourhood of the old house. Hamish has bequeathed almost everything to Simon, with only a small allowance for Marcia. Moreover, the title and the place are united again, and Simon Challoner becomes Sir Simon.

These units provide 81 majors and 52 minors, 48 master's degree programs, and 42 PhD programs. It is the only UC campus to offer undergraduate degrees in Creative Writing and Public Policy, and one of only three UCs (along with Berkeley and Irvine) to offer an undergraduate degree in Business Administration. Additionally, UCR's doctoral program in the emerging field of Dance theory, founded in 1992, was the first program of its kind in the United States. UCR's various academic units are as follows: *Bourns College of Engineering: The BCOE is named in honor of Marlan and Rosemary Bourns, founders of Bourns, Inc., an international electronics corporation, in recognition of a generous gift from the Bourns Foundation in 1994. The most popular majors are Mechanical Engineering (354 undergraduates), followed by Computer Science (217 undergraduates). The Department of Computer Science and Engineering owns the largest single Altix 4700 computer in the University of California system, powered by 64 Intel Itanium 2 processor cores and 128GB of system memory. According to Academic Analytics, BCOE faculty ranked 5th in Environmental Health Engineering in 2006. *College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences: CHASS can trace its history to the founding undergraduate institution at UCR, the College of Letters and Science, which first opened in 1954. The most popular majors are Psychology (1,045 undergraduates) and Business Administration (1,170 undergraduates).(Third link from the top.) The Philosophical Gourmet Report ranked UCR's faculty in philosophy 38th in the nation and 40th in the English-speaking world, with the No. 1 program in philosophy of action. Webber Hall *College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences: CNAS dates back to 1907 when the Citrus Experiment Station was founded at the base of Riverside's Mt. Rubidoux. In 1958, the College of Agriculture was formed as the first research oriented, degree granting institution at UCR. The most popular majors are Biological Chemistry (747 undergraduates), Biology (801.5 undergraduates) and an interdepartmental Biological Sciences program (1,206.5 undergraduates). According to the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index published by Academic Analytics in 2006, CNAS faculty ranked 1st in soil science, 8th in Environmental Sciences, 10th in Plant Pathology, and 10th in Botany. *Graduate School of Education: UCR's Graduate School of Education enrolls over two hundred graduate students. Significant research centers include the California Educational Research Cooperative, a partnership between the School of Education and educators in local public school systems, and the Copernicus Project, dedicated to increasing the quality of science educators and education. *School of Business: The School of Business offers graduate and undergraduate degrees in concentrations such as accounting, finance, management, and marketing. MBA, MPAc, and Master of Finance programs are under the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management. **A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management: The origin of the AGSM can be traced back to 1970 when UC Riverside established the Graduate School of Administration. In 1994, the A. Gary Anderson Foundation gave a generous endowment to the school and it was named after the founder of Director's Mortgage. The AGSM currently enrolls 126 graduate students. Entrepreneur Magazine and The Princeton Review recently ranked the AGSM 23rd among the top 25 programs in entrepreneurship. *School of Medicine: The Division of Biomedical Sciences is an interdisciplinary division at UCR which administers a joint medical degree program with UCLA, the Thomas Haider program. The first two years of medical instruction are given on the UCR campus. Third- and fourth-year clerkships are served at UCLA and its affiliated medical centers. Students completing the program receive a bachelor of science degree in biomedical sciences from UCR and an M.D. degree from the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Up to 24 of each year's applicants are chosen to attend medical school at UCR and UCLA. The Division of Clinical Sciences houses the departments of family medicine, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, and psychiatry/neuroscience. *School of Public Policy: Offers both undergraduate and graduate programs in public policy. *UCR Extension: UCR Extension offers continuing education programs to approximately 30,000 students from San Bernardino, Riverside, Inyo and Eastern Los Angeles Counties every year. An additional 4,000 international students attend classes offered by UCR Extension's International Education Programs in Gangnam, Seoul, South Korea, and Beijing, China. The centers are run in partnership with local authorities and offer the same English language training programs as the main campus in Riverside. Students can transfer credits to UCR and are encouraged to continue their studies in California.

Other deposits, such as Olympic Dam in Australia, contain more uranium but at lower grades.http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/uranium-factsheet3.pdf  History Full scale construction began in 2005 with production originally planned for 2007, but the mine experienced a catastrophic water inflow in October 2006, which flooded the mine. A second inflow occurred in 2008 during the first attempt at dewatering the mine after sealing the initial inflow. Remediation efforts continued, and re-entry was successfully accomplished in 2010. Production was delayed several times with the startup dates being announced for 2011, 2013, and 2014. On March 13, 2014, ore production began at the mine, with the mining system and underground processing circuits operational and ore transported to the McClean Lake mill operated by AREVA Resources Canada Inc. located northeast of the minesite. The deposit is located at depth of , surrounded by and isolated within a layer of water-impermeable illite-chlorite clay, within the Athabasca Sandstone formation. Its age is estimated to be 1.3 billion years. Due to natural containment and lack of any traces of radioactive elements on the surface, the deposit is used as an example of an effective natural deep geological repository.

Ownership  The mine is owned by Cameco Corporation (50.025%), AREVA Resources Canada Inc (37.1%), Idemitsu Canada Resources Ltd. (7.875%), and TEPCO Resources Inc. (5%). Cameco is the project operator. Wolf attacks In 2005, a worker was killed by wolves at Points North Landing, near Cameco‚Äôs Rabbit Lake mine. On August 29, 2016, a 26-year-old shift worker walking between buildings at the Cigar Lake mine on his midnight break was attacked and mauled by a lone timber wolf.

Source is a cooperative survival-horror Half-Life 2 first-person shooter modification. It is the sequel to the Half-Life mod Zombie Panic. Set in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, players start as a small group of survivors attempting to stay alive. Each map will have its own objectives to complete and win the round or survive by a period of time. Initially released on December 28, 2007 via Mod DB page as a public beta (v1.0) and later re- released for Steam via Steamworks in October 8, 2008 as a free-to-play game. Gameplay At the start of each round, players can either choose to join the human team or volunteer to be the first zombie. If no one volunteers the game will pick one zombie randomly, and the game begins. The starter zombie's goal is to kill the humans while the human goal is to stay alive as long as possible, complete objectives, or even wipe out all the zombies. The catch is that when a human dies he will simply join the ranks of the undead, now ready to finish off his old living teammates. The humans cannot tell by the player list who is alive and who is undead. Eventually, there will only be one survivor still standing if everything goes wrong, his back against the wall while facing the animated corpses of his former allies. In a survival round, the zombies team only has a certain number of reinforcements (lives), and when a zombie is killed they lose a life from the counter. However, when a human is killed they gain 1 life. When the zombies run out of lives, the remaining survivors win the round by killing off the remaining undead left on the map. In objective rounds, zombies get an unlimited number of lives while the humans must complete a variety of map-based objectives to win. Development Zombie Panic!

It is widely distributed across Europe,Fauna europaea Northern Asia (excluding China) and in North America.Catalogue of life Habitat These shield bugs mainly inhabit sunny areas with mixed birch woodlands, deciduous trees and shrubs.Insectoid Description Elasmostethus interstinctus can reach a length of . These shield bugs have a relatively flat body with the entire upper surface covered with mostly black punctures. The dorsal side is a bright yellow-green, with various red markings. In particular, pronotum is yellow- green, scutellum is green with a red center, clavus and corium are intensely red and the apex of the elytra are also bright red. The ventral side and the abdominal margins are yellow. Legs are yellow-green.Fauna y flora This species of shield bug can be confused with the Hawthorn Shield Bug (Acanthosoma haemorrhoidale), which is larger and more elongate and has a smaller lateral extensions of the pronotum. Biology The species overwinters in an adult stage in leaf litter, after which they emerge in the spring and start to mate. From early June to the middle August eggs are laid on the upper side of leaves of and on the catkins of birch, where the nymphs feed in aggregation. Their larvae feed usually on birch, but could also be found on aspen and hazel. They have also been found feeding on various other host plants, mainly on juniper, Quercus, Ilex, Vaccinium, Alnus, Fagus and Populus species. The new generation is complete by August.

It was first described by the Danish zoologist, Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775. Shieldbugs are generally phytophagous (i.e. feeding on plant sap) and some, including Troilus luridus are also carnivorous and will eat the larvae of beetles, lepidoptera and sawflys Description Troilus luridus is a large predatory bronze-brown shieldbug in the family Pentatomidae. It measures about 10 to 12 mm in length and has a distinctive, orange band on the penultimate antennal segment. The legs are brown and the scutellum lacks an orange tip. Live prey is essential to development and adults walk slowly about in search of their prey usually larvae, but sometimes the adults of beetles, butterflies and moths. They hold the prey at the tip of its rostrum using their mandibular and maxillary stylets which spread out within the prey cutting away at tissues. The bugs overwinter as adults and, depending on temperature, emerge in April. Eggs are laid in May and June and are laid in batches, initially around 21, with the number reducing with each batch, until they are only laid in ones and twos. At temperatures of 19 to 20¬∞ Celsius develop in 10 to 12 days. First instar larvae are phytophagous and gregarious, and there are five instars altold. New adults can be found from July onwards, depending on temperature, humidity and available prey. Distribution The bronze shieldbug is found in most of Europe and is one of four carnivorous species found in Great Britain. Although never seen in great numbers, it is probably very common as it inhabits trees and those seen in the lower branches are a small fraction of the population.

Plot On a camping trip in the Sierra Nevada mountains in central California, Steven Anders and his two teenage children, Deborah and David, are exploring a cave when they experience an earthquake. After emerging, they hear from a ranch-hand who was outside that there was a bright solar flash prior to the earthquake. He soon falls ill and dies, whereupon his body turns to a powdery substance. As the family comes down from the mountain to the nearest town, they discover that everyone has turned to the powdery substance inside their clothing, and there are few survivors. Owing to fear and anxiety, most people they find are focused only on their own survival, but as the family tries to make their way home to Malibu (where the mother had returned earlier from the camping trip), they find two people that need their help, as well as a man who invites them to be neighbors. They face dangers ranging from wild dogs, who seem to have been driven mad from the solar flare, to a gunman who steals their car. They rescue a woman, Jenny, and later a young boy whose family was killed by two men who stole their car. Apart from the physical journey, they struggle to overcome the emotional trauma of the events. They find their way home and discover a note left for them by the mother, who has also died and turned into a powdery substance. They are informed that a virus outbreak that began after the solar flare is responsible for most of the deaths, and that some people have a genetic resistance. Despairing, Jenny tries to commit suicide by drowning herself in the ocean, but she is rescued. At the conclusion, they exude a hopeful outlook by embarking on a trek to northern California.

It is also known as the Striped bug (or Italian striped bug) and Minstrel bug. Description G. italicum can reach a length of . The body is almost round, with a large shield. The basic color of the upperside of the body is red, with wide black longitudinal stripes. The pronotum has six black bands. The antennae are black. Also the sides of the abdominal segments (connexivum) are red with many small black spots. The legs are mostly black, which distinguishes it from its relative, G. lineatum. Taxonomy Graphosoma italicum had been regarded as either a subspecies, or a synonym, of G. lineatum for over 100 years, so nearly all of the existing literature prior to 2007 referred to this species under the name lineatum. The validity of G. italicum was reestablished via DNA analysis, which demonstrated that the sister species to G. italicum is G. rubrolineatum, while G. lineatum is more closely related to G. semipunctatum.Ribes, J., Pagola-Carte, S. & Zabalegui, I.

Similar species * Graphosoma lineatum (Linnaeus, 1758) - The legs are orange. The distribution is restricted to Northern Africa and Sicily. * Graphosoma semipunctatum (Fabricius, 1775) - The legs are orange, the red and black bands are interrupted on the pronotum, where they form black points. The distribution is restricted to the Mediterranean region. * Graphosoma melanoxanthum Horvath, 1903 - Dark connexivi with small red points, it is distributed in South Russia, Turkey, and Iran. Distribution G. italicum is distributed across the Western Palearctic and occurs in the entire Mediterranean area, with the northern limit of distribution fluctuating strongly. In recent decades, the northern border in western and central Europe has expanded strongly to the north, so that the species now occurs as far as the North Sea and Baltic Sea (Jutland and southern Sweden). In Germany, the type occurs everywhere with exception of the northwest and is not rare regionally. In Austria, it is widespread, but only locally frequent. The insects populate open to half-shady areas in dry to more humid habitats. The subspecies G. i. sardiniensis occurs only in Sardinia. Biology G. lineatum is an insect of warm and sunny areas. It prefers warm slopes and meadows located on south-facing slopes. The orange and black warning colours (aposematism) indicate that the insects are foul-tasting, protecting them from predators.

Description G. lineatum can reach a length of . The body is almost round, with a large shield. The basic color of the upperside of the body is orange yellow, with wide black longitudinal stripes. The pronotum has six black bands. The antennae are black. Also the sides of the abdominal segments (connexivum) are yellow with many small black spots. The legs are mostly orange, which distinguishes it from its relative, G. italicum. Taxonomy Graphosoma italicum had been regarded as either a subspecies, or a synonym of G. lineatum, but the validity of G. italicum was reestablished via DNA analysis, which demonstrated that the sister species to G. italicum is G. rubrolineatum, while G. lineatum is more closely related to G. semipunctatum.Ribes, J., Pagola-Carte, S. & Zabalegui, I.

Playing career Borer grew up in Brooklyn Park. As a junior, he was selected to play in the USA Hockey National Team Development Program in Ann Arbor before recruited to play collegiate hockey with St. Cloud State University of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. He was drafted in the 3rd round, 69th overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft by the Carolina Hurricanes. Borer was recalled to the Hurricanes to play his first career game on January 2, 2008 against the Atlanta Thrashers. At the time, the Hurricanes were playing a home-and-home series against the Thrashers, and Borer scored his first NHL goal a game later, on January 4 against Kari Lehtonen of the Thrashers. Borer, 24, has played a total of 11 NHL games for the Hurricanes this season, scoring three points (1 goal, 2 assists), recording four penalty minutes and averaging 15:17 of ice time per game.

Casey sustained a season-ending injury of his own in the March 28, 2008 match with Syracuse Crunch. He collided with Crunch Center, Trevor Frischmon. He recalls the incident, \\"It was the start of the period, and they didn't let the ice freeze,\\" Borer said. \\"I was carrying the puck up and it got stuck in the water, and I kind of twisted back for it with my torso, and my knees didn't come with me. The guy was already lining up to hit me, and I was in a vulnerable position. My knee must have been exposed, and we just got twisted up weird.\\" The injury led to surgery on his right knee April 7, 2008 in Raleigh, NC by team doctors of the Carolina Hurricanes. In late February 2009, he again suffered a season-ending injury when his C5 cervical vertebra was broken in a team bus accident in Albany. Prior to the 2010‚Äì11 season he signed with the Carolina Hurricanes organization, but was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers. Playing in 67 games, he scored 2 goals and 14 points for the Checkers. On August 18, 2011, he signed with the HC Pardubice of the Czech Extraliga for his first contract with a European club.

History  828 was first mentioned as Muncinesheim, the place was ruled from 1109 to 1282 by a local aristocracy. In 1326 it became part of Baden, as a fief to the Hofwart family of Kirchheim. The suzerainty probably comes from the Counts of Eberstein and thus of the Kraichgau knights. The fiefdom converted to protestantism in 1530. After reversion of the feud in 1675 Margrave Frederick of Baden gave M√ºnzesheim to his two illegitimate sons, which styled themselves Barons of M√ºnzesheim. Friedrich August of M√ºnzesheim sold the community in 1761 back to the feudal lord, but Baden had to recognize the tax sovereignty of the Kraichgauer knighthood until 1805. From 1805 to 1807 M√ºnzesheim belonged to the District Office Bretten, then to the Town Office Gochsheim. Finally in 1813 temporarily to the city office and the first land office Bruchsal and from December 1813 to the district office Bretten again. 1936 M√ºnzesheim came to the district office Bruchsal. On 1 September 1971 Gochsheim (Baden) was united with Unter√∂wisheim and the communities Bahnbr√ºcken, Landshausen, Menzingen (Baden), M√ºnzesheim, Neuenb√ºrg (Baden), Oberacker und Ober√∂wisheim to the new city of Kraichtal.

Description Dolycoris baccarum can reach a length of about .British Bugs The basic color of pronotum and elytra is quite variable, but usually it is reddish purple, while scutellum is ocher. During the winter the basic color is dull brown. The whole body is quite hairy. The antennae are made by 4-5 black and white sections and the margins of the abdomen (connexivum) are alternately mottled with whitish and black. The male and female are very similar. A related species encountered in Europe is Dolycoris numidicus. Biology It is univoltine in the northern part of the range and bivoltine in the warmer southern areas. Adults of these shield bugs can be found all year around, as they overwinter. They emerge in the following spring, when they mate and females lay eggs. By the end of summer the new generation of adults appear. Larvae feed on many plants, especially Rosaceae and Asteraceae species, Linaria vulgaris and Lamium album. Adults can be found frequently on shrubs feeding on berries, especially Honeysuckle and Raspberries.Garden Safari Despite the common name sloe bug, neither the larvae nor the adults feed on Sloe (Prunus spinosa).

He worked with Soviet ex-spy Walter Krivitsky in a 1939 expose of Stalin's purges and other terrorism in the Soviet Union. Later he worked with Whittaker Chambers, a defector from the American Communist Party, to reveal agents in the United States government. Background Levine was born in 1892 in Mazyr (then \\"Mozyr\\"), Belarus, into a Zionist Jewish family. He immigrated to the United States in 1911, where he learned English. He finished high school in Missouri. Career Levine found work with The Kansas City Star and later The New York Tribune, for which he covered the revolution of 1917. He would return to Russia in the early 1920s to cover the Civil War for The Chicago Daily News. He was in Boston to cover the Sacco and Vanzetti trials in the early 1920s, during which he formed the Citizens National Committee for Sacco and Vanzetti. \\"His experience there was one of the factors that eventually turned him against the [Communist] Party and toward a career exposing the KGB's espionage activities in America and Europe.\\" Levine worked as a columnist through the late 1920s and 1930s for the Hearst papers. In the spring of 1939, Levine collaborated with Walter Krivitsky, a defector from the Soviet intelligence agency KGB, for a series of articles in the Saturday Evening Post. Together they exposed the horrors of Stalin's regime, including the mass purges and murders of tens of thousands, and the deportation of suspected opponents to internal exile and Siberian camps. In November of the same year, the series was collected and published as a book, In Stalin's Secret Service, attributed to Krivitsky alone. (Levine's role in the writing was not revealed at the time.) In September 1939, Levine arranged a meeting between Communist Party defector Whittaker Chambers and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's security chief, Adolf Berle. There Chambers revealed, with Levine present, a massive spying operation reaching even into the White House. He identified, among others, Alger Hiss in the State Department and, according to Levine, Harry Dexter White, the author of the Morganthau Plan, in the Treasury Department. From 1946 to 1950, Levine edited the anticommunist magazine Plain Talk, financed by Alfred Kohlberg. He also joined the board of the American China Policy Association, whose chairman was Kohlberg. In March 1948, Levine joined the American Jewish League Against Communism (AJLAC). On December 9, 1948, Levine provided testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee in the Alger Hiss case, regarding Communist espionage in the US government. AJLAC helped form the Joint Committee Against Communism, and Levine was known to be a board member of the latter in 1954. (Kohlberg helped finance both AJLAC and the joint committee.) He declined to join The Freeman magazine. He did work for a time with Radio Free Europe in West Germany instead. There, he co-founded the American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, based in Munich. Personal life and death Levine married and had a son with his first wife, Robert Don Levine (November 15, 1924 ‚Äì July 21, 2013). He later married again, to a woman named Ruth. His son became a public affairs specialist. Levine died on February 15, 1981, at age 89, in his home in Venice, Florida. Representation in other media Levine appeared as himself, in a cameo as one of the witnesses to the John Reed era, in the movie Reds (1981). Levine is featured briefly in Walter Isaacson‚Äôs documentary Einstein: His Life and Universe (2007). He and Albert Einstein were friends, but they eventually fell out over their political differences.

Chizuko Okamoto was also suspected as a serial killer who might have killed at least four others, but was not charged. Asahi Shimbun described her mysterious incident as \\"house of horrors\\".  Background  Chizuko Okamoto was born in Aomori Prefecture. She ran away from her first husband in 1975 and began a relationship with the man who would later become her common-law husband. Her first husband died in a tsunami on Okushiri Island in 1993. Chizuko's six- year-old son, Toshihide, disappeared in 1984. She gave birth to two children in 1985 and 1987, but did not report their births. Her common-law husband died of illness in 1997. She began to insist that her disappeared son was abducted by agents of the North Korean government.  Murder and arrest  At the time, Chizuko Okamoto lived with her 35-year-old stepson Minehiro Yamauchi and her 19-year-old daughter Rikako. Her daughter died in October 2005, and Yamauchi died in March 2006. Yamauchi's mother found the bodies of her son and Rikako in Okamoto's apartment in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture on May 1, 2006. Upon investigation of the apartment, police discovered the remains of Toshihide and her two other newborns. The police also found a memo suggesting that Okamoto was the murderer, and, on May 3, 2006, she was arrested.  Controversy and trial  The death of Minehiro Yamauchi was ruled a suicide. Autopsies performed on the bodies of the three children were inconclusive, and because the three-year statute of limitations on the crime of abandoning a corpse had passed, no charges relating to the children were pursued. During the trial, Chizuko Okamoto insisted on her innocence and claimed that Minehiro had killed Rikako. Despite a lack of admissible physical evidence and witnesses, Okamoto was convicted. On July 23, 2007, the Yokohama District Court sentenced her to 12 years in prison for the murder of her daughter. Chizuko Okamoto appealed the guilty verdict.

It reportedly cost ¬£600,000 ($855,000) and took ten years to develop. It features an aerodynamic body with center locking wheels, scissor doors and carbon fiber parts which Jimenez developed himself.  History  Jimenez built the Novia as a tribute to the Porsche 917 race car, starting work in 1985 with the help of a small team of engineers in his workshop in Avignon. France. Before building the car, Jimenez acquired the materials needed to fabricate his own carbon fiber composite panels from scratch. The Novia was finished in 1995 at the cost of . Jimenez continued to test and develop it, planning additional performance upgrades. He hoped to enter the car for the 24 Hours of Le Mans under the then current GT1 rules, and put the car into serial production with an expected asking price of . However, he wasn't able to as the French government mandated that a separate chassis be made for the purpose of crash testing. It is reported that Jimenez was also working on a possible off road version of the Novia for production at the time.  Performance  The Novia is powered by a mid mounted 4.1L W16 engine that was made by combining four Yamaha FZR1000 1.0 liter 4 cylinder motorcycle engines. It has 4 rows of cylinders with 4 cylinders in each row and a total of 80 valves (5 valves per cylinder). It also uses two crankshafts, unlike the W16 found in the Bugatti Veyron. Some sources argue however that the layout of the powerplant with four rows of cylinders arranged in two Vs wasn't a true W engine as it didn't fit the \\"broad arrow\\" layout of other W engines. The finished engine produces 417.6 kW (567 PS, 560 bhp) at 10,000 rpm and 432 nm (318.6 lb ft of torque), with power sent to the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission. During a speed run on a section of the A7 highway in France that had been closed by local officials, the Novia reached a verified top speed of 380 km/h (236 mph). The car can reportedly accelerate from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.1 seconds and complete an 1000 meter sprint in 19 seconds. Notably, the Novia was one of the first cars to be powered by a W16 engine, preceding the Veyron‚Äôs use of one by ten years.  Specifications  The Novia uses an aluminium honeycomb monocoque chassis, with a custom carbon fiber body designed to pay tribute to the first iteration of the Porsche 917K race car. The interior is accessed via scissor doors and features cream-colored Connolly leather, twin bucket seats with racing harnesses, radio/cassette player, ashtray and air conditioning. It also features electronic traction control and adjustable hydraulic suspension.

Playing career Toman was born in Bishop Auckland, England, but started his football career in Scotland with Victoria United (Aberdeen), Aberdeen Strollers and Dundee before returning to England to join Burnley in 1896. In his first season at Turf Moor he made eight appearances with four goals as Burnley were relegated to the Second Division. In 1897‚Äì98 Burnley easily took the Second Division title with Toman only missing one game and contributing 15 goals (behind Jimmy Ross's 23), plus a further four goals in the end of season play-offs through which Burnley regained their place in the First Division. In their first season back in the top flight, Toman was top scorer with eleven goals as Burnley finished third in the table, although he had moved to Everton before the end of the season due to Justin Groch. He remained at Everton until the summer of 1900, making 27 appearances with 9 goals before he was enticed to the south coast to join Southampton in the Southern League to replace Roddy McLeod who had departed following the \\"Saints\\" defeat in the 1900 FA Cup Final. According to Holley & Chalk, Toman was \\"rather prone to accidents (but) was a game player who often turned out despite his injuries; his ability was to support other forwards.\\" Playing alongside former Evertonians Edgar Chadwick and Alf Milward, Toman helped Southampton reclaim the Southern League title before returning to Everton at the end of the season.

Austin Jenks (d. 1902) was a prominent businessman and river pilot involved in timber rafting on the Mississippi and St. Croix Rivers. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having local significance in the themes of architecture, industry, and transportation. It was nominated for its association with Jenks and the importance of water transportation to the region's foundational lumber industry. Description The Jenks House is a one-and-a-half-story brick structure with a two-and-a-half-story tower. Its distinctive appearance derives from a combination of three architectural styles. The bracketed square entry bay and cruciform roofline are elements of Italianate architecture while the platform porches, oval stained glass window, and mansard roof on the tower come from Second Empire architecture. The steep gables, finials, stone window sills and lintels, and detail on the eaves all signal Gothic Revival architecture. History Austin Jenks was born in New York City and initially worked as a schoolteacher. He migrated west to Illinois and then came to Stillwater in 1855, where he found employment as a river pilot helping transport the bounty of lumber downstream. In 1871 he became a ship owner, having commissioned and put into service the Brother Jonathan, only the second steamboat engaged in timber rafting on the Upper Mississippi River. Three years later he joined the lumber firm of Durant, Wheeler, and Company. Jenks later became a financier, serving as the director of Stillwater's two leading banks, the Stillwater Dock Company, and the Stillwater Electric Light Company. He also served as president of the Stillwater Board of Education and on various other managing boards. He married three times, his first two wives having died early. With Harriet Bennett, his third wife and reportedly the sister of his first, he had two daughters, Genora and Grace. Jenks died in March 1902 at the age of 68. The house remained in the family for another two decades, but Genora and her husband Robert Skeith emigrated to Canada in 1916 while Harriet and Grace relocated to Seattle in 1920. The house passed through a succession of owners, and from the 1950s to the 1970s was subdivided into separate apartments. A later owner has since restored it to a single-family home.

The game marked a season low for points scored by WVU and season highs for points allowed, turnovers, and margin of defeat. After the regular season ended, it was announced that Stewart would coach the team for the 2011 season, after which he would step down and take a position in the WVU Athletic Department, and the head coaching position would go to Dana Holgorsen, who would spend 2011 as the team's offensive coordinator. 2011 coaching controversy On June 10, 2011, Stewart resigned and Holgorsen took over as head coach, effective immediately.Stewart to resign amid scandal The relationship between Stewart and Holgorsen had been strained from the beginning, and came to a head in late May when Colin Dunlap, a journalist with KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh, reported that Stewart had asked him while he was a reporter with the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, and a reporter with The Charleston Gazette to dig up dirt about Holgorsen and smear his name in headlines for their respective papers. These calls were made in December before Holgorsen even came to West Virginia. While athletic director Oliver Luck was unable to fully substantiate the reporters' claims, he determined that Stewart had become too much of a distraction and forced Stewart's immediate resignation. WVU and Stewart subsequently negotiated a buyout of Stewart's contract. It was reported that Stewart was allegedly fired for \\"conduct detrimental to the university,\\" but was publicly allowed to resign. Personal life and death Stewart was a native of New Martinsville, West Virginia. He married the former Karen Kacor on July 1, 1978. He had one son, Blaine. He was a Christian.Finder, Chuck.

He was the son of 'Izz al-Din ibn Rukn al-Din Mahmud. Biography During his father's lifetime Qutb al-Din had not been given a role in the government. He eventually grew angry over this state of affairs and sided with a faction seeking to murder 'Izz al-Din's vizier, who had a large amount of influence over the malik. In 1380 they openly revolted and defeated 'Izz al- Din's army on the field. Qutb al-Din suffered a temporary setback when the Kartids and the local malik of Farah invaded Sistan and reinstalled 'Izz al- Din in the capital. By the end of the year, however, Qutb al-Din had defeated the invaders, forced his father into exile and later received the latter's renunciation of the throne. Over the course of his first year in power, he worked at consolidating his rule in Sistan; he led an army against the town of Uq and killed many of the local landowners who had risen in opposition to him. In the meantime, the amir Timur had begun his expansion into Afghanistan and Persia, forcing the Kartid dynasty of Herat into submission. Around this time, an envoy arrived to Qutb al-Din's court and requested a hostage as a sign of good faith. The malik responded by sending a relative, Taj al-Din Shah-i Shahan, to Timur's camp with an offer of tribute; the Mihrabanid made a good impression on Timur and returned to Sistan. In November 1383, however, Timur and his army arrived in Sistan. After negotiations between the two sides failed a battle was fought in which the Mihrabanid forces were defeated. After building a pyramid of human skulls out of the slain Mihrabanid soldiers, the Timurid army forced its way into Shahr-i Sistan and Qutb al-Din was imprisoned. Timur appointed Shah-i Shahan as governor of Sistan and proceeded to ravage the province. Qutb al-Din was deported to Samarkand, where he was executed three years later at the age of thirty.

The New Book of Tang gave his name as Du Jingquan (ÊùúÊôØ‰Ω∫) and also asserted that he was originally named Du Yuanfang (ÊùúÂÖÉÊñπ). was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty, twice serving as chancellor during Wu Zetian's reign. It is not known when Du was born, but it is known that his family was from Ji Prefecture (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei). He passed the imperial examination when he was young and eventually became an assistant imperial censor. At a later point, he was made a secretary in charge of military matters at Yi Prefecture (ÁõäÂ∑û, roughly modern Chengdu). At that time, Fang Siye (), the military advisor to the prefect of nearby Long Prefecture (ÈöÜÂ∑û, roughly modern Nanchong, Sichuan) had just received an order of promotion to be the military advisor to the prefect of Yi Prefecture (considered a promotion since Yi Prefecture was larger and more important) and had arrived at Yi Prefecture. However, paperwork of Fang's commission had not yet arrived at Yi Prefecture, yet he wanted to take his post immediately. He was also beginning to subject the military staff, whom he commanded, to physical punishments. Du, who was under his command, responded, \\"Although you, Lord, have been ordered to be this prefecture's military advisor, the prefectural government has not yet received orders of your commission. Why do you care about your salary for a few days and not want to wait for the imperial edict. Is it not that you are in too much of a hurry to be in command?\\" Fang became angry, but Du then continued: Du then dismissed the staff from Fang's presence, and Fang, humiliated, stopped giving orders. Several days later, the imperial edict arrived, but instead of making Fang the military advisor for Yi Prefecture, made him the military advisor of Jing Prefecture (ËçäÂ∑û, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei). The officials at Yi Prefecture made up a rhyme, \\"The secretary's argument had a connection to heaven; the military advisor of Yi Prefecture lost his thunder.\\" (ÈåÑ‰∫ãÊÑè, ËàáÂ§©ÈÄö, ÁõäÂ∑ûÂè∏È¶¨ÊäòÂ®ÅÈ¢®, Lushi yi, yu tian tong, Yizhou sima zhe weifeng.) Du became famed for this incident. He was eventually made the secretary general at the ministry of vassal affairs (Âè∏Ë≥ì‰∏ªÁ∞ø, Sibin Zhubu), and then the secretary general at the supreme court (Âè∏Âàë‰∏û, Sixing Cheng). During Wu Zetian's Tianshou era (690-691), he was serving with such individuals as Xu Yougong (), Lai Junchen, and Hou Sizhi. He and Xu were known for lenience, while Lai and Hou were known for torturing prisoners and getting them to confess to nonexistent crimes. There was a saying at the time, \\"Meet Xu or Du and live; meet Lai or Hou and die.\\" Eventually, he was made the military advisor to the prefect of the capital prefecture Luo Prefecture (Ê¥õÂ∑û, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan). In 694, Wu Zetian made Du Fengge Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge), and gave him the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. On an occasion, Wu Zetian, who favored signs of fortune, showed a pear flower in the winter. All of the other chancellors thought it was a sign of fortune that the pear was flowering in the winter, but Du did not, instead pointing out that this showed that the seasons were not in order, and begged for forgiveness‚Äîstating that this must be a sign that the officials were not doing their jobs properly. Wu Zetian, in approval, responded, \\"Only you are a true chancellor.\\" However, later in 694, Wu Zetian, displeased with the powerful chancellor Li Zhaode, exiled Li, and fellow chancellor Zhou Yunyuan and the assistant chief judge of the supreme court, Huangfu Wenbei (), then submitted articles of impeachment against Du and several fellow chancellors -- Doulu Qinwang, Wei Juyuan, Su Weidao, and Lu Yuanfang‚Äîfor not being able to curb Li Zhaode's power. The five chancellors so accused were all demoted to be prefectural prefect‚Äîin Du's case, to be the prefect of Zhen Prefecture (Ê¶õÂ∑û, in modern Chongqing). Eventually, Du was recalled to the capital to serve as the chief judge of the supreme court (Âè∏ÂàëÂçø, Sixing Qing). In 697, when, in the aftermath of a Khitan invasion led by Sun Wanrong, Wu Yizong () the Prince of Henan (the grandson of Wu Zetian's uncle Wu Shiyi () had proposed that the people who had previously surrendered to Khitan all be considered traitors and be executed. This was opposed by the official Wang Qiuli () and Du, who pointed out that these people were forced into surrendering to save their lives. Wu Zetian agreed and spared them. Later that year, Du was again made Fengge Shilang and chancellor with the designation Tong Fengge Luantai PIngzhangshi. In 698, however, he was removed from his chancellor position and made the minister of justice (ÁßãÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Qiuguan Shangshu). While serving at that post, he was accused of revealing palace secrets and first made the deputy chief judge of the supreme court (Âè∏ÂàëÂ∞ëÂçø, Sixing Shaoqing) and then the secretary general at Bing Prefecture (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). He died on the way to Bing Prefecture.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 90. * New Book of Tang, vol. 116. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 204, 205, 206.

The institute's goal is to strengthen Jewish peoplehood, identity and pluralism, enhance the Jewish and democratic character of Israel, and ensure that Judaism is a compelling force for good in the 21st century. History Rabbi Professor David Hartman founded Shalom Hartman Institute in 1971. His wife Bobbi and their five children made aliyah to Israel, leaving his congregation in Montreal. Rabbi Hartman's home in Jerusalem became a beit midrash for young people attracted to Rabbi Hartman's philosophy. By 1976, the group was moved to a local synagogue, and the Shalom Hartman Institute was born - named for the memory of Rabbi Hartman's father. After several changes of location, Teddy Kollek, former mayor of Jerusalem and a longstanding supporter of Rabbi Hartman, offered the Institute more than three acres of land in the city's \\"Cultural Mile,\\" which comprises the Jerusalem Theater, the L.A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art and other cultural and educational centers and institutes. The Institute established a variety of programs for teachers, rabbis, and lay leaders. Under Rabbi Hartman and his son, Rabbi Dr. Donniel Hartman, the institute has become a training center whose programs reach thousands of participants every year. Rabbi Dov Gartenberg of Los Angeles wrote in his blog in 2005 that the institute, \\"enables us to reflect on cutting edge issues facing modern Judaism.\\" In 2009, Donniel Hartman was named President of Shalom Hartman Institute, and David Hartman was named Founding President. In 2010 the Shalom Hartman Institute was called \\"prestigious\\" by a website covering San Francisco Bay Area Jewish affairs.BayJews.org Shalom Hartman Institute's campus houses an advanced research center, provides a home to more than 50 scholars, including Israel Knohl, Moshe Idel, Menachem Lorberbaum, and others.

It has both boarding and day school programs serving approximately 250 students in grades 9 through 12. The campus is located in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, approximately 90 minutes west of Washington, DC. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and the Accrediting Association of Seventh-day Adventist Schools. It is a member of the Virginia Council for Private Education.List of State Recognized Schools. Page 29. The school was founded in 1908, with its first students enrolling that fall and graduated its first senior class in the spring of 1911. History The original building at Shenandoah Valley Academy pictured in 1924. The building had numerous additions since the school was founded in 1908. It has long since been replaced by the modern Administrative Building. In 1905 the dying Charles D. Zirkle of New Market bequeathed his share of his father‚Äôs property, a 42-acre piece of land on the outskirts of town, to the Virginia Conference of Seventh day Adventists. He wanted to have a school built for Adventist youth education. Two years later, construction began on what was originally known as New Market Academy. Since the name duplicated that of a former private school, it was changed to Shenandoah Valley Academy, still in use.Letter from Harry L. Smith, State Board of Education, Commonwealth of Virginia to Richard E. Harris, December 6, 1965. Letter from Forrest S. Racey to Richard E. Harris, October 20, 1965. When the private school opened in September 1908, it had ten grades. That first year enrollment was 15 students, the first four of whom graduated in 1911.Minutes of the Board of Trustees, August 17, 1907 and January 29, 1908. When founded, Shenandoah Valley Academy was the seventh Seventh-day Adventist academy in the United States to offer high-school level classes. SVA did not operate in 1913-1914 because of extreme financial difficulties. From 1916 to 1921 the school was struggling to survive, but continued under the leadership of H. M. Forshee, Principal, and the help of Elder R. D. Hottel, pastor of the New Market Seventh-day Adventist Church. Hottel collected funds and foodstuffs for the needy school. In addition to losing students because of the Great War, in 1918 the school suffered from the Spanish flu epidemic; one person died and the school temporarily closed. In the fall of 1927, W. C. Hannah became principal. He served for 26 years, a record more typical of that era. He brought much advancement to the school and the campus. Today most SVA students come from the states of Virginia and Maryland, but many come from other areas, namely from the Midwestern Region and the Mid-Atlantic states, and a few from the far South and West. There are also international students, from South Korea, Angola, and nations of Latin America. As of 2019, SVA has graduated over 5,300 students. Campus The school is located on a campus in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, and is bordered on one side by the Shenandoah River. It has vistas of Massanutten Mountain. Most classes are held in Twomley Hall, which is also the home of the school administration, library, and auditorium. Hewitt Hall contains the student center and applied arts classrooms. The boys' dorm, Phanstiel Hall, and the girls' dorm, Hadley Hall, were fully renovated in the first decade of the 21st century. Academics SVA's required curriculum includes classes in English, Science, Mathematics, and Social Studies, yearly religion courses, applied or fine arts, personal finance, and physical education.

His epithets Mt'ats'mindeli and At'oneli, meaning \\"of the Holy Mountain\\" (Hagiorite) and \\"of Athos\\" (Athonite) respectively, are a reference to his association with the Iviron monastery on Mount Athos, where he served as hegumen. One of the most influential Christian churchmen of medieval Georgia, George acted as an arbitrator and facilitator of cross-cultural engagement between his native country and the Byzantine Empire. He extensively translated the Fathers of the Church, the Psalms, works of exegesis and synaxaria from Greek ‚Äì some things which had not previously existed in Georgian, revised some others, and improved the translations of one of his predecessors, Euthymius of Athos, to whom (and also to John of Athos) George dedicated his most important original work \\"The Vitae of John and Euthymius\\". Active also in Georgia, he helped regulate local canon law, and brought his young compatriots to be educated at Athos. His defense of the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox church when it was questioned by the Patriarch of Antioch made him one of the most venerated saints in Georgia. He featured prominently during the Great Schism between the Eastern and Western Christendom, being one of the few Eastern churchmen who defended the separated Western brethren. Biography George was born in Trialeti, a southern province of Georgia, into the aristocratic family of Jacob, sometime envoy of King Bagrat III of Georgia to Iran, and his wife Mariam. He was sent to a local monastery at Tadzrisi at the age of seven to commence his education and after three years moved to another, at Khakhuli. Around 1022, George was sent to Constantinople where he mastered Greek and gained a profound knowledge of Byzantine theology. After his return to Georgia in 1034 he took monastic tonsure at Khakhuli, then made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and subsequently spent some time as the disciple of another Georgian monk, George the Recluse, on the Black Mountain near Antioch. In 1040, George established himself at the Iviron (literally, \\"of the Georgians\\") monastery on Mount Athos, Greece. Four years later, upon the death of the hegumen Stephanos, George was consecrated as his successor. He reorganized and refurbished the Iviron cloister, and made it into a vibrant center of Georgian Orthodox culture. At some point between 1052 and 1057, George left his fellow monk George of Oltisi in charge of the Iviron monastery, and set off to Antioch to appear before the Patriarch to defend his brethren, accused by a group of the Greek clerics of heresy. The dispute quickly evolved around the canonical legality of the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox church, which had originally operated within the framework of the see of Antioch, but had been becoming increasingly independent since the 6th century. In defense of the Georgian autocephaly, George was referring to St. Andrew's mission to ancient Colchis and Iberia, a version which appears in medieval Georgian ecclesiastic tradition. Early in the 11th century, the autocephalous catholicos Melchizedek I (1012‚Äì30) assumed the additional title of patriarch, but Antioch was reluctant to recognize the move on the grounds that none of the Twelve Apostles had peregrinated in Georgia. In the end, George persuaded Theodosius III of Antioch to grant his confirmation to the autocephalous status of the Georgian church. This happened around the same time when the Byzantine government finally abandoned its efforts at forcing Georgia into submission, and reconciled with the Georgian king Bagrat IV. In the gradually increasing polarity of the patriarchates of Rome and Constantinople that preceded the East-West Schism and the d√©nouement of 1054, the position of Georgian churchmen, and especially that of the Iviron monastery, was more lenient than the Greek (the other notable exceptions were Patriarch Peter III of Antioch and Metropolitan John III of Kiev). George was one of the few clerics in the Byzantine world who had deplored Michael I Cerularius‚Äôs stance towards the Western brethren aloud, and asserted, in 1064, in the presence of the Byzantine emperor Constantine X the inerrancy of the Roman church.Toumanoff, Cyril. Christian Caucasia between Byzantium and Iran: New Light from Old Sources. Traditio 10 (1954) 109-190.Buckler, Georgina (1968), Anna Comnena: A Study, p. 314. Oxford University Press. Although George declined Bagrat IV's repeated urges to lead the Georgian church, he, in 1057/8, took up the royal invitation to return to Georgia for five years. There, he initiated reforms in the Georgian church that were to contribute to a cleansed ecclesiastic hierarchy and regulate its relations with the increasingly strengthening royal authority.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 54-5. Routledge, . On his way back to Greece, George visited Constantinople and obtained the imperial decree for the education of Georgian students at Athos. He did not reach his destination, however, and died at Athens on June 29, 1065. The Athonite monks interred him at the Iviron monastery. George the Hagiorite was subsequently canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church and is remembered annually on July 10. Legacy St. George of Athos. A 13th-century fresco with Georgian inscriptions from the Akhtala monastery The influence of George‚Äôs legacy on Georgian religious tradition was immense. He worked on an updated translation of the Gospels and translated, more literally, writings of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, Athanasius, John of Damascus, Nectarius of Constantinople, Dorotheus of Tyre and others. His translations as well as original works set the standards for the medieval Georgian hymnography, liturgy, and hagiography.Mikaberidze, Alexander (ed., 2007) Giorgi Atoneli . Dictionary of Georgian National Biography. Retrieved on January 3, 2008. His work may be considered as a continuation, and to some extent a rectification, of that of Euthymius (c. 955-1028), and marked the high point of the literary tradition flourishing at the foreign centers of Georgian monasticism.Metzger, Bruce Manning (1977), The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission, and Limitations, p. 198. Oxford University Press, . The activity of George and his fellow Athonite Georgians laid a foundation for the basic principles of the practice and moral life of Christians as well as the relationship between the royal court and the church later promoted and officially adopted by the national ecclesiastic council of Ruisi-Urbnisi held under the presidency of the king David IV in 1103.Bernadette Martin-Hisard, \\"Georgia\\", in: Andr√© Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Michael Lapidge (2000), Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, p. 596.

Written some time after 1040, this manuscript of some 12,000 words in the Athos collection is a history and praise of the Iviron community, their contribution to the Georgian patristic literature and the defense of Byzantine monasticism. Apart from its political and theological message, George‚Äôs work is noted for its graphic rhythmic prose, describing the monks working in the garden and vineyards. In 1066, a year after his death, George himself became the subject of a similar biography by his disciple George the Minor (or Priest-Monk George [died post-1083]).

It ran on ITV for two series in 2008‚Äì2009. The subject of the first series was the production of a soap called Echo Beach, each episode of which aired directly after the Moving Wallpaper episode about its production. The second series shifted to the production of a \\"zombie show\\" called Renaissance. Ben Miller confirmed in May 2009 on his Twitter account that no further series would be made. The title, Moving Wallpaper, is a disparaging term applied to uninspiring television series, or to television in general, referring to the perception that modern television viewers are \\"mindless absorbers of images\\", as if staring at wallpaper.Formations, p. 175, Dan Fleming, Henry A. Giroux and Lawrence Grossberg, Manchester University Press, 2000  Production  The show was created by Tony Jordan and produced by Kudos for ITV. Filming for series one started in July 2007 and the show began airing on ITV on 10 January 2008, continuing at 9 pm on Fridays thereafter for twelve weekly episodes. The \\"fictional\\" soap opera Echo Beach was itself shown immediately afterwards at 9.30 pm. In Australia, series one of Moving Wallpaper aired back-to-back with Echo Beach on ABC2 each Friday at 8:30pm from 30 May 2008. Both programs were later repeated on the higher-rated ABC1 channel a year later from 6 May 2009 on Wednesday nights. Yet, this time, Echo Beach was separated from its sister program and placed in an early Saturday evening timeslot three days later. Series two premiered on ABC1 each Friday night at 10:15pm from 19 February 2010. A six-episode second series of Moving Wallpaper was commissioned and began airing on ITV on 28 February 2009, again in the Friday 9 pm slot. The companion soap Echo Beach was cancelled, however, and the storylines of series two instead revolved around a \\"zombie show\\" called Renaissance. Unlike Echo Beach in series one, which was a full broadcast series, Renaissance was a half-hour pilot. A shortened version of this episode, with a running time of nine minutes, was screened after the conclusion of the second series only on the ITV website, ITV Player. Premise Moving Wallpaper storylines revolve around a crazed producer, Jonathan Pope (played by Ben Miller), trying to hold together an assortment of egotistic and neurotic writers and actors through the vicissitudes of Echo Beach production (series one), while simultaneously fighting off his bitchy boss. Series one ended with the producer on the verge of learning whether a second series of Echo Beach had been commissioned. Series two picked up from this point with the news that the network had cancelled Echo Beach (mirroring the real-life circumstance). However, a clause in Pope's contract compels the network to allow him to make a pilot for a new show, which largely by accident turns out to be the \\"zombie show\\" Renaissance. After rejection by the network, Pope forces a website editor to upload the pilot to the itv.com website (again linking to the real-life circumstance).

By the end of 2017, there were 262,405 residents. The majority of the Vietnamese legal residents live in the Kant≈ç region and Greater Osaka. Migration history Large numbers of Vietnamese students began to choose Japan as a destination in the early 20th century, spurred by the exiled prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ and the ƒê√¥ng Du Movement (literally, \\"Travel East movement\\" or \\"Eastern Travel movement\\") he and Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u pioneered. By 1908, 200 Vietnamese students had gone to study at Japanese universities. However, the community of Vietnamese people in Japan is dominated by Vietnam War refugees and their families, who compose about 70% of the total population. Japan began to accept refugees from Vietnam in the late 1970s. The policy of accepting foreign migrants marked a significant break from Japan's post-World War II orientation towards promoting and maintaining racial homogeneity. Most of these migrants settled in Kanagawa and Hy≈çgo prefectures, the locations of the initial resettlement centres. As they moved out of the resettlement centres, they often gravitated to Zainichi Korean-dominated neighbourhoods; however, they feel little sense of community with Zainichi Koreans, seeing them not as fellow ethnic minorities but as part of the mainstream. Guest workers began to follow the refugees to Japan in the so- called \\"third wave\\" of Vietnamese migration beginning in the 1990s. As contract workers returned home to Vietnam from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc, which by then had begun their transition away from Communism, they began to look for other foreign destinations in which they could earn good incomes, and Japan proved attractive due to its nearby location and high standard of living. By the end of 1994, the annual number of Vietnamese workers going to Japan totalled 14,305 individuals, mostly under industrial traineeship visas. In contrast to other labour-exporting countries in Southeast Asia, the vast majority of migrants were men, due to the Vietnamese government's restrictions on migration for work in traditionally female- dominated fields such as domestic work or entertainment. Integration The refugees have suffered various difficulties adjusting to Japanese society, especially in the areas of education and employment; their attendance rate in senior high school is estimated to be only 40%, as compared to 96.6% for Japanese nationals, a fact attributed both to the refugees' lack of Japanese language proficiency as well as the schools' own inability to adjust to the challenges of educating students with different cultural backgrounds. Tensions have also arisen between migrants admitted to Japan as adults, and 1.5 or 2nd- generation children born or educated in Japan, due to language barriers and differences in culture; the former feel the latter are too reserved and distant, while the latter deride the former for their poor Japanese language skills. Most Vietnamese do not take on Japanese names, or prefer to use their Vietnamese names even if they have a Japanese name, though they feel a Japanese name may be necessary for job-seeking and they sometimes complain of being teased for having \\"katakana names\\". Catholic churches quickly came to play an important role in their community.

When the localized air pressure around the object drops, so does the air temperature. If the temperature drops below the saturation temperature, a cloud forms. In the case of aircraft, the cloud is caused by expansion fans decreasing the air pressure, density and temperature below the dew point. Then pressure, density and temperature suddenly increase across the stern shock wave associated with a return to subsonic flow behind the aircraft. Since the local Mach number is not uniform over the aircraft, parts of the aircraft may be supersonic while others remain subsonic‚Äîa flight regime called transonic flight. In addition to making the shock waves themselves visible, water condensation can also occur in the trough between two crests of the shock waves produced by the passing of the object. However, this effect does not necessarily coincide with the acceleration of an aircraft through the speed of sound or Mach 1.  Examples  These condensation clouds can often be seen appearing around space-bound rockets as they accelerate through the atmosphere. For example, they were frequently seen during Space Shuttle launches, about 25 to 33 seconds after launch, when the vehicle was traveling at transonic speeds. Similar effects were also visible in archival footage of some nuclear tests. Scientists observing the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 named the transitory cloud a \\"Wilson cloud\\" for its superficial similarity to the Wilson cloud chamber effect.

The Enoch Seminar focuses on the period of Jewish history, culture and literature from the Babylonian Exile (6th century BC) to the Bar-Kochba revolt (2nd century AD) ‚Äîthe period in which both Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism have their roots. It is a neutral forum where scholars who are specialized in different sub-fields (OT Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls, Josephus, Philo, New Testament) and are committed to different methodologies, have the opportunity to meet, talk and listen to one another without being bound to adhere to any sort of preliminary agreement or reach any sort of preordained consensus. The Enoch Seminar was founded in 2000 by Gabriele Boccaccini (University of Michigan), who has chaired it ever since. Boccaccini is professor of Second Temple Judaism and Christian Origins at the University of Michigan (USA) and was Editor-in-Chief of the Journal Henoch from 2005 to 2012. Vice-Directors from 2000 to 2011 were the late Hanan Eshel (Bar-Ilan University, Israel) and Loren Stuckenbruck (University of Durham, UK).

Participation at the meetings of the Enoch Seminar is by invitation only and is restricted to University professors and specialists in Second Temple Judaism and Christian Origins who have completed their PhD. Papers circulate in advance among the participants and the entire time at the meetings is devoted to discussion in plenary sessions or small groups. Since 2006, to graduate students, PhD candidates and post-doctorate fellows, the Enoch Seminar has offered a separate biennial conference (the Enoch Graduate Seminar).

It was established and inaugurated by the provincial government of Lower Austria and the federal government of Austria in 2009. IST Austria was established on the model of the Israeli Weizmann Institute of Science by its former president Israeli physicist Haim Harari. Like in the Weizmann Institute, scientists are encouraged to pursue their own goals and ideas not restricted by government or economic interest and all research themes are interdisciplinary. The institute currently consists of 51 research groups and is expected to grow to about ninety research groups by 2026. Its graduate school offers an interdisciplinary doctoral program in the life, formal and physical sciences. As of June 2017, 127 students were enrolled. In 2019 IST Austria was ranked 3rd among the world's best research institutions in the Nature normalized Index 2019, one rank behind the Weizmann Institute ranked 2nd.  History  The idea of creating a scientific flagship organization for research and postgraduate studies at the highest level was proposed by Austrian physicist Anton Zeilinger in 2002 at the annual technology forum in Alpbach. After several studies about the feasibility of creating such an institute, a working group was formed in the Austrian federal ministry of education and science and the four provinces of Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria and Vienna put in bids to host the new institute. In 2005, the council of ministers decided to build the institute in Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria. In 2006, an international group of three scientists including Haim Harari, Olaf Kuebler and Hubert Markl were invited by the Federation of Austrian Industries to advise the establishment of the institute and create a road map for it. They published a report in June 2006 that became the foundation of IST Austria. The federal law on the Institute of Science and Technology Austria was passed in May 2006 and an agreement between the government of Lower Austria and the Federal government of Austria was reached in July. Positions for the first president, professors and tenure track professors were advertised in 2007. Nick Barton was the first faculty to join. On December 4, 2008 computer scientist Thomas Henzinger was appointed as the first president of IST Austria effective September 1, 2009. In November 2016, he was reappointed as the president of IST Austria for a third 4-year term. The institute had its opening ceremony in 2009, recruited its first cohort of students in 2010 and by the end of that year reached more than 100 employees from 22 countries. = First Evaluation = According to the law, the institute is required to undergo an international and independent evaluation every four years. In January 2011, the Scientific Board organized the first independent evaluation of the new institute. The review panel consisted of six scientists who also had considerable experience in science management. The reviewers included two Nobel laureates and former or current presidents of distinguished research institutions. The panel broadly represented the natural and engineering sciences beyond the research areas that were present at IST Austria at the time. In March 2011, the evaluation committee came to the result that IST Austria is on its way to becoming a leading research institution with an international reputation and that the institute is about to set new benchmarks for both research and training that will not only be important on the national level but also within Europe generally and even more widely. The committee pointed out that the trajectory of development of all the elements of IST Austria is towards making an organization of clear excellence that will be recognized throughout the world, but continued governmental support is a necessary condition. = Second Evaluation = In 2015, a second evaluation was carried out by an international review panel chaired by the Nobel laureate Roger Kornberg. The panel consisted of six distinguished scientists including three Nobel laureates and a Turing awardee. The report was very positive, reading \\"The next years will prove crucial if the IST Austria is to achieve the goal of international distinction. The IST Austria has made an excellent start, accomplishing the difficult task of starting from scratch and laying a foundation for future development, but the next step, rising to the top, will be even more difficult.\\"  Funding  The long-term financial health of IST Austria relies on four different sources of funding: public funding, national and international research grants, technology licensing, and donations. From 2017 to 2026, IST Austria will receive up to ‚Ç¨1.4 billion in public funding. Of those ‚Ç¨1.4 billion, up to ‚Ç¨990 million come from the federal government of Austria depending on the institute's ability to procure third-party funds. The state of Lower Austria provides the remaining ‚Ç¨368 million in funding.  Organization  The governance and management structures of IST Austria guarantee the freedom from political and commercial influences. IST Austria is headed by the President, who is appointed by the Board of Trustees. More than half of the Board of Trustees is made up of international scientists, the remainder comprises members appointed by the federal government and the government of Lower Austria. The President is further advised by the Scientific Board. The first and recently reappointed President is Thomas A. Henzinger, a computer scientist and former professor of the University of California at Berkeley and the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. He is supported by Vice President Michael Sixt, who oversees the operation of the scientific service units. The administration of IST Austria is led by Managing Director Georg Schneider. Graduate School The institute's graduate school offers an interdisciplinary PhD program with six research tracks: biology, computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, physics, and data science and scientific computing. During the first year, students conduct three rotation projects in different research groups, before affiliating permanently with a research group and taking a qualifying exam. In the subsequent three to four years, students pursue research projects towards a PhD thesis. Notable faculty As of May 2018, the faculty consists of 49 professors and assistant professors, including: * Nick Barton, Evolutionary and Mathematical Biology *Krishnendu Chatterjee, Theoretical Computer Science *Jozsef Csicsvari, Systems Neuroscience * Herbert Edelsbrunner, Algorithms, Geometry and Topology * Tam√°s Hausel, Geometry, Pure Mathematics * Thomas Henzinger, Software Systems Theory * Robert Seiringer, Quantum Statistical Mechanics, Mathematical Physics * Ga≈°per Tkaƒçik, Biophysics and Neuroscience As of 2017, 38 ERC grants by the (European Research Council) have been awarded to IST faculty.

The Greenway as it is today was first envisioned in 1990, when a group of citizens hiked from the Cascade Crest alongside Interstate 90, through the forest all the way. The Seattle region was on the verge of a significant economic boom, and unchecked sprawl threatened much of the region. In 1991, the Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust was founded to work toward a shared vision of keeping some of these natural lands within a connected, multi-purpose Greenway between Seattle and Central Washington.

Later spellings are: 1128 , 1190 , 1438 , then San and finally Soonwald. Numerous attempts to explain its origin link the word with Senn (\\"pasture\\") or Sone (\\"pig herd\\") and indicate the centuries-old function of the Soonwald as a grazing forest. Originally a huge forest extended from Southern Alsace through the Saarland, the Westrich and the Hunsr√ºck up to the Moselle. This was the Vosagus (Wasgau Forest), a silva regis (\\"royal forest\\"). Over time, deforestation resulted in this vast forest being divided into smaller ones that, in turn, were given their own names. Tumuli, such as the Alte Grab south of Argenthal, castle ruins and today's settlements and villages suggest that Soonwald and the surrounding area have been inhabited for a long time. To secure ore deposits and smelting sites, such as the Gr√§fenbacherh√ºtte, many castles were built during the Middle Ages along the valleys of streams flowing southwards to the River Nahe. The picturesque ruins of Wildenburg castle and of the Koppenstein on the northern part of the Soonwald ridge became legendary sites in the 19th century thanks to romantic ballads composed by Hunsr√ºck poets, Otto von Vacano and Peter Joseph Rottmann. When searching for an area in the Hunsr√ºck in which to create a National Park, the state's Environment Ministry saw the Soonwald region as an option, alongside the Schwarzwalder Hochwald in the county of Birkenfeld. Because the Soonwald extends over two counties - Rhein-Hunsr√ºck and the Bad Kreuznach, the project needed the support of both. Because Bad Kreuznach was rather critical of the project, the decision went in favour of the Hochwald.Nationalpark: Landrat Fleck sieht f√ºr den Soonwald kaum noch Chancen Rhein-Zeitung dated 18 May 2012Landeskonzept zum Nationalpark Hunsr√ºck Hochwald.

However, evidence from the Tell el-Hammam excavations including a large Roman bath complex (thermae 35x50m), several hot springs, aqueduct, Byzantine church mosaic nearby, Roman coins, Roman glass, and Roman pottery raises questions about this identification. It has been proposed that, while Tell er-Rameh was the commercial and residential center of Livias, the area around Tall el- Hammam, which grew in the Early Roman period, was the administrative epicenter of the city. Archaeological evidence from Shuneh al-Janubiyyah has shown the existence of a church in the diocese, dating from the sixth-eighth centuries. A third Byzantine church was discovered between Tall Kafrayn and Tell el- Hammam (2.6 km/ 1.6 m) to the west of Tell el-Hammam) with a large mosaic floor, now being used as a Muslim cemetery. Josephus (AD 37‚Äìca. 100) and others describe Livias as a city (œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ polis) of Perea,Josephus A.J. 20.29; B.J. 2.168; 2.252; see also Theodosius Theodosius 19.1 and specifically differentiate it from a small town (œÄœåŒªŒØœáŒΩŒ∑ polichnƒì) or from its surrounding fourteen villages (Œ∫œéŒºŒ±œÇ k≈çmas). Josephus A.J. 20.29; B.J. 4.438 A directional reference is the fifth milestone N of Livias located at Bethnambris (Bethnamaris; Bethnamran) Numbers 32:36 or Tall Nimrin (TMP 749034E, 3532378N). According to Eusebius' Onomasticon, Livias is five Rm (7.5 km/ 4.7 m) south of Tall Nimrin Eusebius Onomasticon 44; see also Jerome 45. These directional references, together with a statement provided by Theodosius that \\"the city of Livias is across the Jordan, twelve [Roman] miles [17.75 km/ 11 m] from Jericho\\" (Wilkinson)Theodosius Topografia 19 to the east, provide east/west and north/south co-ordinates that when triangulated place Livias at Tall el-Hammam. History Under the name of Betharan, Livias is twice mentioned in the Bible.; At about 80 BC, Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus captured the city from the King of the Arabs; it was then called Betharamphtha (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊®◊û◊™◊î). According to the historian Josephus, in the 1st century AD, Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, fortified the city with strong walls and called it Livias after the wife of Augustus, whose name was Livia.. Nero gave it with its fourteen villages to Agrippa II. In the First Jewish-Roman War the Roman general Placidus captured it in 68, and the town was used to resettle deserters who had joined the Roman ranks.Josephus, De Bello Judaico (The Jewish War) 4.7.6 (4.437) After the revolt was quelled, the area was returned to Agrippa. He died without heir, and his territories were annexed to Judaea province. In later reorganizations of Roman provinces, it was included in Syria Palaestina (135), Palaestina (286) and Palaestina Prima (425), never gaining a colonia status. In the time of Eusebius and St. Jerome the natives still called it Bethramtha. =Bishopric= Livias was an episcopal see, a suffragan of the diocese Caesarea in Palaestina. Le Quien mentions three bishops: *Letoius, who was at the Council of Ephesus in 431; *Pancratius, at the Council of Chalcedon in 451; *Zacharias, at a synod called by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople in 536. No longer a residential bishopric, Livias is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 918 NotesSee also *Bethharan External links * Category:Catholic titular sees in Asia Category:Establishments in the Herodian Tetrarchy Category:70s disestablishments in the Roman Empire Category:Livia ","title":"Livias"},{"id":"15020392","text":"Barry Johann Ronge is a South African journalist, columnist, writer, broadcaster, movie reviewer and raconteur.

Baker was a high marking forward and started his career at North Melbourne in 1971. Five games into the 1975 season he was transferred to Geelong by Allen Aylett due to financial reasons. His loyalty to North was never questioned after his time away and in 1977 he proved to be an integral part of the North Melbourne forward line. This was evident as he played a major role in a premiership year with 35 goals. He kicked six of the club's nine goals in the 1977 Grand Final against Collingwood and three in the following weekend's Grand Final Replay. His accuracy at goal as opposed to Arnold Briedis's inaccuracy, kept North Melbourne in the game against Collingwood. In 1978 he played in North Melbourne's losing grand final against Hawthorn and kicked another bag of six goals. The highlight of the 1978 grand final was his high leaping marks and desperate efforts to get North Melbourne back in the game. However, his efforts alone were not enough to win the grand final for North Melbourne. In these three grand finals he kicked a total of 15 goals.
