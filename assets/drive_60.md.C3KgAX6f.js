History The 71st Pennsylvania was organized in August 1861 by Oregon Senator Edward D. Baker, composed of 15 companies instead of the standard 10. Although raised from residents of Philadelphia, it was initially designated the 1st Regiment, California Volunteer Infantry in deference to Baker's wishes. After his death at the Battle of Balls Bluff in November 1861, it was renamed the 71st Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. It was grouped with the 69th, 72nd, and 106th Pennsylvania regiments to form the famous Philadelphia Brigade. The 71st was assigned to the II Corps in time to participate in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign. During the Seven Days Battles, it made several charges, losing many officers and men. After reaching Harrison's Landing, companies L, M, N, P, and R were merged into the first ten companies. The regiment, along with rest of the Army of the Potomac, was transferred to northern Virginia. Here the 71st fought at the battles of Second Bull Run and Chantilly. It helped cover Pope's retreat. At the Battle of Antietam that September, the regiment lost one third of its strength. It again suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December. At the Battle of Gettysburg, the 71st was positioned at the famous Angle on Cemetery Ridge. On July 2, it helped defeat the attack by Brig. Gen. Ambrose Wright's brigade. On July 3, it was briefly sent to Culp's Hill but was returned to Cemetery Ridge. Half of the regiment was placed along the advanced wall with the 69th Pennsylvania to its left, while the other half was 50 yards to its right-rear. During Pickett's Charge, the left portion of the regiment was forced back from the wall and nearly routed. Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb managed to rally the regiment near the 72nd and 106th Pennsylvania, but was unable to convince any of the three units to counterattack at first. Finally after several minutes, they pushed the Confederates out of the Angle. The 71st lost 98 officers and men during the attack, including nine out of fifteen officers. The 71st served through the Overland Campaign, losing heavily in both men and officers. At the Battle of the Wilderness, Lt. Col. Charles Kochersperger was wounded and five colorbearers were shot down, and at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Capt. Mitchell Smith was killed. The regiment's last battle as a unit was at Cold Harbor. Afterwards, those entitled to discharge (a total of 53) were mustered out in Philadelphia on July 2, 1864. The remainder of the regiment was merged into the 69th Pennsylvania. Out of a total of 1,665 men who served in the regiment during the war, only 153 returned uninjured.

The company was created in 1994 in Buffalo, New York by co-founders Richard Kegler and Carima El-Behairy. The company is best known for its type designs, which have appeared in films (e.g. Harry Potter, Suburbicon) and on commercial products (e.g. Trader Joe's, Founders Brewing Co.). The P22 Type Foundry retail font collection specializes in historical letterforms inspired by art, history, and science that otherwise have never been available previously in digital form. P22 works with museums and foundations to ensure the development of accurate historical typefaces, and with private clients to create custom bespoke fonts.  History  The name P22 has no specific significance and was used by founder Richard Kegler prior to the type foundry as a label for various art projects including an ambitious mail art correspondence. Once P22 started developing fonts, they began to sell them packaged on floppy disks. These were very popular in museum stores because of their art history focus. P22 began to work with museums and artist foundations (Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, Guggenheim Museum, Burchfield-Penney Art Center, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, et al.) to develop these art history based font sets. The floppy disks soon gave way in the late 1990s to CD-ROMs packaged in boxes with key charts. During this decade P22 moved locations three times within Buffalo to accommodate growth and manufacturing concerns. Later, with the adaptation of the internet as a means to deliver fonts, P22 reduced its staff and moved to its last Buffalo location. P22 went virtual for a few years when founder Richard Kegler became the Director of the Book Arts at Wells College in Aurora, NY. When Kegler ended his tenure at Wells in 2019, P22 once again coalesced into a studio location in Rochester, NY.  P22 Type Collections  P22 as independent type foundry consists of a few partners and outside contractors, who create the core P22 collection fonts. However P22 licenses new exclusive type designs from independent designers and makes them available via the International House of Fonts (IHOF) collection, since 2001. In 2003, P22 acquired the collection of Ted Staunton (briefly known as the Sherwood Type Collection), which consists of expertly designed alphabets that have historical basis, but tend toward the fanciful and mythic. Staunton continues to design and publish new fonts to this collection. In 2004, P22 acquired the Lanston Type Co. form Gerald Giampa, and continues to update and publish fonts from this renowned collection of type. Known as the Lanston Type Collection (LTC), it contains classic type designs from the likes of Fredric Goudy, Sol Hess, Bruce Rogers, among many others. In 2005, Richard Kegler initiated the Rimmer Type Foundry with Jim Rimmer, to make his proprietary type designs available to a larger audience. Because Jim Rimmer is a Canadian national artistic treasure, the digital holdings of this division were repatriated to Patrick Griffin of Canada Type in 2012. In 2012, P22 partnered with the Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum to publish a collection of wood type revivals. A portion of every sale of the Hamilton Wood Type Collection (HWT) fonts goes to help fund the museum's mission.  Notable P22 Typefaces  *P22 Underground Pro, originally published 1997 when the London Transport Museum licensed the original Edward Johnston font made for the London Underground to the P22 Type Foundry. *P22 Cezanne Pro originally designed by Michael Want 1996, and expanded in 2005. This script font is nearly ubiquitous and used on all kinds of commercial graphic design and packaging. *P22 Operina Pro designed by James Grieshaber, was licensed by Apple Computer and made available within the MacOS as Trattatello. *P22 Marcel is more than just a script typeface, it is the product of a journey undertaken by designer Carolyn Porter. to learn the fate of Marcel Heuz√©, a Frenchman conscripted into labor during World War II, whose handwritten letters provided source material for the font.  P22 Publications  P22 self publishes from time to time.They published the Indie Fonts books (a collection of 3 volumes) in the early 2000s, to illuminate the work of small independent type designers. P22 produced a documentary film in 2011 called Making Faces, to document the process of book artist Jim Rimmer as he developed a traditional metal font, from concept drawing through to casting in lead. P22 has also published Savage Impressions, a comprehensive book on the work of artist and letterpress- printer Bruce Licher and his Independent Project Records & Press. P22 / Atom Smash Records P22/Atom Smash Records is P22's music publishing branch. Originally started to promote and publish local Buffalo, NY bands, they have gone on to produce nineteen releases, including reissues of Rod McKuen records, a techno band called The William Caslon Experience, and the latest release is a vinyl LP of Bruce Licher's demos called Tape Excavation to accompany the Savage Impressions book.

She was the founding emperor Liu Yuan's concubine. Her son Liu Cong was Liu Yuan's fourth son, and it is not known whether she bore other children for Liu Yuan. When Liu Cong seized the throne in 310 after overthrowing his older brother Liu He (after Liu He had tried to have him and the other brothers killed and successfully killed two), he honored both her and Liu Yuan's wife, Empress Dan, empresses dowager -- Empress Dan with the greater title of Huangtaihou (ÁöáÂ§™Âêé) and her with the lesser title of Ditaihou (Â∏ùÂ§™Âêé). When Empress Dowager Dan died later that year, however, she received the greater title of Huangtaihou. She was known only for a few incidents during her stint as empress dowager. In 312, at her insistence, Liu Cong took two daughters of his cousin (and therefore her nephew) Zhang Shi (ÂºµÂØî) as his concubines. Later that year, when Liu Cong was wrongly punishing the official Wang Zhang (ÁéãÂΩ∞) for trying to persuade him to be milder in his temper and actions, Empress Dowager Zhang protested by fasting for three days, eventually helping to correct Liu Cong's behavior for a time. Yet later that year, when Liu Cong was set to create his concubine Liu Ying (ÂäâËã±) as empress, Empress Zhang insisted against it and for her grandniece Zhang Huiguang, whom Liu Cong then formally created empress in early 313. Three months later, Empress Dowager Zhang died and was honored with a posthumous empress title. Her grandniece the empress mourned her so greatly and was so depressed that she died as well.

Introduced in 1980, the line evolved into today's 4T40/45/65/80 line. Turbo-Hydramatic 125 The 3-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 125 was introduced in 1980 and produced through 2001. It carried over some parts from the light-duty Turbo-Hydramatic 200 and 350, but was generally a new design. The 125 was renamed 3T40 later, following GM's new naming convention. After the 1995 introduction of the electronically controlled 4T40-E 4-speed, the 3T40 was gradually phased out. Applications: * 1982‚Äì1996 A-body * 1980‚Äì1985 X-body * 1982‚Äì2001 J-body * 1990-1993 W-body * 1987‚Äì1996 L body * 1990‚Äì1995 U-body vans (with LG6 engine) * 1984-1988 Pontiac Fiero Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C This was a later model of the 125 that debuted for 1982 and included a torque converter clutch or TCC. The TCC acts similar to a clutch in a manual transmission vehicle, in that at speeds above 35 MPH a combination of engine vacuum- and temperature-sensing valves, and a dedicated brake switch - and in later models an ECU - activated a solenoid which engaged a clutch physically locking the impeller and turbine inside the torque converter together causing engine power to be transferred directly to the transaxle. The C in Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C denoted the use of a TCC. The solenoid that controls this is notorious for failure due to overheated plastic componentry, and problems indicated by an engine stall when stopping from speeds greater than 55 MPH. This occurs because the clutch does not disengage, and as the affected vehicle's speed nears zero miles per hour, the engine is forced to decelerate to zero rpm. Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C AWD For the 1988 model year, the Pontiac Division of GM utilized a THM 125C modified to accommodate a full-time All-Wheel-Drive planetary gear transfer case and output housing to send 40% of the output torque to the rear wheels in the 3.1 liter powered 6000STE. While a similar design was used for the later 4T65E, the three speed design was utilized for onlythree model years, after which all-wheel drive was discontinued as an option for the carline. Turbo- Hydramatic 440-T4 The model THM440T4 indicates Turbo HydraMatic Model 440, Transversely Mounted, 4 Speed Fully Automatic transaxle. A 4-speed transaxle which replaced the 125, was created for the 1985‚Äì1986 GM C platform (FWD)/GM H platform (FWD) cars, the Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4. Virtually no internal parts were shared with the 125, and overdrive was achieved by departing radically from the standard single Simpson compound planetary gearset's common sungear layout. This transaxle was first used in GM's 1985 Buick Park Avenue, Oldsmobile 98, and Cadillac Deville. In 1986, after switching to FWD, the Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile Delta 88, and later, the Pontiac Bonneville also used this transaxle. The 440-T4 was later renamed the 4T60 under GM's new transmission naming convention. A version of the 4T60 called the 4T60-HD, which incorporated upgraded final drive hardware but was otherwise mechanically indistinguishable from standard units, was used in the 1989-1990 Pontiac Grand Prix with the turbocharged engine. GM started adding electronic controls to the 4T60 in 1990 with the Cadillac Allante carline's unique F7, and 1991 and after with the corporate 4T60-E. One unique feature of this transmission is its use of both a modulator valve and a throttle valve (TV) cable. Most transmissions either use one or the other to control shift points and shift smoothness. On the Turbo 440-T4, the TV cable exclusively controls the shift points, while the modulator valve controls the shift feel, with very little overlap between the effects of one adjustment on the other. This feature makes it very easy for a do-it-yourself mechanic to adjust the transmission shift points with minimum effect on the shift feel. The 440-T4 was originally slated to be used with downsized C-Body cars for 1984. However, issues with failures due to lack of fluid lubrication to critical clutch train parts in the relatively complex and compact design, led to the introduction of transverse FWD 4-speed automatics being delayed as an option until 1984 for the 1985 model year.

It has only two pot stills, making it one of the smallest in Scotland, producing a whisky that has been described as having a \\"West Highland\\" flavour that falls between the dry, smoky style of the Scottish islands and the lighter, sweeter malts of the Highlands.  History  The distillery was built in 1794 by the brothers John and Hugh Stevenson and operated by them until 1866, when it was bought by Peter Curnstie. It was then acquired by Walter Higgin in 1883 and rebuilt. In 1898, Alexander Edward, who also owned Aultmore Distillery, bought out Higgin. In its first year of operation, it suffered major losses when a major blending company, Pattison's of Leith, went under. In 1923, Oban was sold to Dewars and joined Distillers Company with that company in 1925. It fell silent from 1931 until 1937 and again from 1969 to 1972 when a new still house was built.

In August 1509, Alexander took a fort-city Gori and the northwestern corner of Kartli, but had to abandon the occupied lands to David due to the Ottoman raid on Imereti in 1510. A year later, George of Kakheti surged into Kartli, but failed to capture the king in a besieged castle of Ateni. In 1513, George invaded again, only to be defeated and taken prisoner by David‚Äôs younger brother Bagrat I of Mukhrani. He died in captivity and his kingdom was annexed to Kartli. In 1518, the Persian shah Ismail I of the newly established Safavid dynasty, sent in an army under Div Sultan Rumlu, who was joined by the Georgian prince Qvarqvare III Jaqeli, atabeg of Samtskhe. The invaders occupied Surami and Gori, and David had to make peace with the Persians and to promise to pay tribute. Meanwhile, the Kakhetian nobles used the opportunity to install Levan, son of the late king George II, as their king. David besieged the Maghrani Castle where Levan had taken positions, but soon had to abandon the siege as the Turcomans appeared again in the Georgian lands. David recognised Lavan as the king of Kakheti in order to win his support against the invaders. In 1522, he refused to convert to Islam as Shah Ismail had demanded. A new Persian invasion ensued, led this time personally by the shah. David and his son, Luarsab I, offered him a fierce resistance at the Battle of Teleti, but were finally outnumbered and defeated. The Kartlian capital Tbilisi was taken by treachery and garrisoned by a large Persian force, making east Georgia nominally fall for the first time under Safavid rule. On the death of Ismail in 1524, David liberated Tbilisi and expelled the Persians from the country. In 1525, he reconquered Aghjakala, Lower Kartli, and massacred all the Turkoman Qizilbash who had settled there. The same year, he abdicated the throne in favor of his younger brother, George IX, and retired to a monastery under the name of Damiane. David X died in 1526 and was buried at the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral at Mtskheta. Family David, as crown prince, first married Nestan-Darejan or Miraingul, daughter of Prince David Baratashvili (), but the union was denounced by David's father, Constantine II. David married secondly to Tamar (died in 1554), daughter of Kvarkvare II Jaqeli, Atabag of Samtskhe. She might have been the mother of all of David's children, including his eldest son and successor Luarsab I. Prince Vakhushti reports that the mother of Luarsab was captured by Shah Tahmasp I at Ateni and carried off to Iran, where she committed suicide by poisoning in 1556. According to Cyril Toumanoff, Nestan-Darejan/Miraingul was the mother of David's three sons, Luarsab, Adarnase, and Ramaz, and it was she who committed suicide in 1556. He considers Tamar to have been the third name of this queen, such polyonymy not being infrequent in Georgia at that time.Toumanoff, Cyrille (1976) (in French).

It is known for its abuse of Chinese laborers on Saipan resulting with Levi's severing all ties with the company once the conditions of the workers came to light. History Established in Saipan in 1991, Tan Holdings Corporation serves as the umbrella organization to businesses established as early as 1972 in Guam by the Tan family, led by its patriarch, Tan Siu Lin, who sits as chairman of the board. From its first company in 1972 which distributed films to local cinemas, Dr. Tan Siu Lin with the support of his wife Lam Pek Kim and their children, built their business to include real estate and shipping. Today, the family-run business has evolved to include cargo airlines, commercial fishing, ground handling service, hotels, information technology, financial services, logistics services, publishing, retail and wholesale distribution, amusement, and fast food. Jerry Tan, third son to Dr. Tan Siu Lin and Lam Pek Kim, and who is based in Saipan, serves as the company's COO and President. He has, for the past decade or so, been heading the company's activities and thrusts across the western pacific. The company's Executive Vice-President is George Chiu, who is based in Guam. In the 1980s‚Äì1990s, at the height of the garments industry in Saipan, the Tan family's garment operations were one of the largest on-island. However, in 2005 when the garment quota on China was lifted, factories in Saipan began to shift operations back to China, where labor was much cheaper. Saipan saw the last of its factories close down in 2008. In 1992, Cited for sub-minimum wages, seven-day work weeks with 12-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities, Tan Holdings Corporation, Levi Strauss' Marianas subcontractor, paid what were then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1,200 employees.https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/20/world/stretching-federal-labor- law-far-into-south-pacific.html In 2002, Tan Holdings Corporation established the Tan Holdings Foundation, an organization whose sole existence was to promote and support the philanthropic efforts and aspirations of Dr. Tan Siu Lin and his family. In 2003, Jerry Tan was awarded Business Person of the Year by the Saipan Chamber of Commerce, and in 2004, as Employer of the Year by the CNMI Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM). With the loss of garments manufacturing as a key industry, Tan Holdings shifted its focus to tourism, heavily investing in the industry and promoting the islands to China, Korea and Russia, as well as to the CNMI's traditional market, Japan. In 2009, Jerry Tan was awarded the 2009 Executive of the Year by Guam Business News. The award is given to outstanding businessmen in recognition of their success and significant contributions to the Guam community through civic and humanitarian activities.

Although the phrase is sometimes employed in a serious context, its use is usually intended to be humorous or nostalgic. Origin in Doctor Who The expression originated from popular media commentary on young children being frightened by episodes of the BBC science-fiction television series Doctor Who, particularly during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The idea that young children would hide behind furniture when especially frightening scenes and monsters were being shown, as they were unwilling to miss the programme altogether, was also popularised in the media.\\"Still, the Daleks are the boss space horrors, something to get the children hiding behind the sofa.\\" The phrase is strongly associated with Doctor Who in the United Kingdom, so much so that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named its exhibition celebrating the programme \\"Behind the Sofa\\". \\"Everyone remembers hiding behind the sofa,\\" journalist Sinclair McKay wrote of the programme during its thirtieth anniversary year of 1993. \\"Remember hiding behind the sofa every time Doctor Who came on the television?\\"Pringle, Maggie. \\"Dr Who's 30 Years of Time Travel\\" . Daily Mirror. Friday 17 February 1995. the Daily Mirror newspaper asked its readers in a feature article two years later. In a 2006 interview with Sky News, Prince Andrew, Duke of York said that he hid from Daleks behind a Windsor Castle settee while watching Doctor Who as a child.Lyon, Shaun. Outpost Gallifrey News Page, Outpost Gallifrey. Friday 21 April 2006. The Economist has presented \\"hiding behind the sofa whenever the Daleks appear\\" as a British cultural institution on a par with Bovril and tea- time; furthermore, it appeared (without any explanation of the idiom) in BBC reportage of the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign. Paul Parsons, author of The Science of Doctor Who, explains the appeal of hiding behind the sofa as the activation of the fear response in the amygdala in conjunction with reassurances of safety from the brain's frontal lobe.Parsons, Paul. \\"Who believes in who\\" Daily Telegraph. Tuesday 28 March 2006. (URL accessed 30 March 2006.) In other popular culture Despite the phrase being almost universally associated with Doctor Who, the phrase has also found more general usage in the UK as a humorous or satirical metaphor for being in a state of fear or terror. For example, after he was sacked as the presenter of the comedy programme Have I Got News for You in 2002 due to revelations about his private life, Angus Deayton released a press statement which concluded: \\"I sincerely wish the show well in the future and look forward to watching this Friday's episode ‚Äî from behind the sofa.\\"BBC News Online. \\"Quiz host Deayton fired by BBC\\". Wednesday 30 October 2002. (URL accessed 4 January 2006). Another example comes from sports coverage; in a live text commentary on a cricket match in the 2005 Ashes series for the Guardian Unlimited website, journalist Rob Smyth wrote of one moment during the game: \\"Now that Warne's gone, it's safe for Gilo to come out from behind the sofa: his second ball is chipped tantalisingly over the blundering Hoggard at mid-off by Gillespie.\\"Guardian Unlimited. \\"Third Test, day four. Over-by-over: morning session\\". Sunday 14 August 2005. (URL accessed 4 January 2006). In scripted programming, a reference occurred in a 2001 episode of the BBC sitcom Coupling, where the central character Steve, while extolling the virtues of a sofa, remarks on its usefulness in avoiding Daleks. Coupling writer Steven Moffat went on to write for and then become executive producer of the revived series of Doctor Who.

Early career Two weeks after walking into Eileen Ford's modeling agency (ostensibly to look for a summer job), Corby was sent on her first modeling assignment. By the end of that first summer, she was steadily booking assignments and her parents enrolled her in Manhattan's Professional Children's School, which allows for the irregular schedules of actors and models.

Although born in Nottingham he worked for the majority of his career in and around Derby, where he had moved in 1880. He served as president of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Architectural Society. Career He was for many years in partnership with architect W. E. Richardson. He also worked in conjunction with surveyor John Ward, who subcontracted architectural work to him, although sometimes signing drawings produced by MacPherson. MacPherson worked in a variety of styles from the baroque of department stores such as the Co- Operative Central Halls he designed in Derby and elsewhere, to the 'Queen Anne' of the now demolished Children's Hospital in Derby. He was however, perhaps happiest designing in the Tudor style made popular during the Arts and Crafts movement. Buildings such as Littleover Old Hall, Derbyshire (1898), Reginald Street Public Baths, Derby (1904), Victoria Street Tramways Office, Derby (1904), and the workers' houses he built for the Liversage Charity Estate and Haslam foundry in Derby are characteristic of this style. MacPherson's interiors were often crammed with richly carved woodwork. His rooms in Aston Hall, Aston upon Trent, and the Friary, Friargate, Derby, are good surviving examples of this style. In later years he increasingly adopted the classical style, his work for the Walker Okeover family of Osmaston Manor, Derbyshire, being a good example of this period in his career. His last known major work, Bemrose School in Derby, is a powerful essay in the pared down classical style (1928‚Äì30), which has recently been altered.

The Act set the number of members of the United States House of Representatives at 105, effective with the 3rd Congress on March 4, 1793, and established that a number of representatives would be allotted to each state based on the population enumeration provided by the 1790 Census. The final apportionment, which was not part of the Act itself, was on the basis of \\"the ratio of one for every thirty-three thousand persons in the respective States\\", and used the Jefferson method3 Annals of Cong. 539 (1792) which required fractional remainders to be ignored when calculating each state's total number of representatives. This apportionment method continued to be used until the 1830 census. After discarding the remainders, the average population of congressional districts was 34,436 persons. An earlier apportionment bill had been approved by the House in February 1792 and the Senate in March 1792, but was vetoed by the President on April 5, 1792. It was the first presidential veto of legislation in American history.Washington exercises first presidential veto Background The United States Constitution provided the first apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and stipulated that a Census (‚Äúenumeration‚Äù) of the population of the states must be made within three years of the first meeting of Congress. That first Census took place in 1790. Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution stipulates that the apportionment of seats is to be effected on the basis of population, and that each state is entitled to at least one representative. Text  Original bill =Legislative history= An earlier apportionment bill was vetoed by President George Washington on April 5, 1792 as unconstitutional, marking the first use of the U.S. President's veto power. Washington made two objections in a letter to the House describing the reason for his veto. The first objection made in the letter was that the bill did not have a uniform ratio to reach the numbers of representatives to population set forth in the bill. Secondly, the bill \\"allotted to eight of the States more than one for every thirty thousand\\" as delimited by Article I Section II of the United States Constitution.The Library of Congress: Annals of Congress, House of Representatives, 2nd Congress, 1st Session, p.539. Retrieved on 2008-10-3. The next day, the House attempted to override the President's veto but failed to reach the two thirds vote required and on April 10 efforts began to revise the bill a third time. =Review= On March 26, the bill was presented to the President. There was great disagreement among Washington's advisors, and therefore he called upon Edmund Randolph, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and Henry Knox to give him their opinions of the bill. Randolph and Jefferson both said, as the bill established the total number of representatives, 120, by dividing the aggregate of the federal census by 30,000, it was unconstitutional. The Constitution required, they argued, the choice of a common divisor and the division of the population residing in each state by that number to establish the size of the United States House of Representatives. Also, because the bill gave an additional member to the eight states with the largest fraction left over after dividing by 30,000 was, according to Randolph, \\"repugnant to the spirit of the constitution\\". Jefferson urged that Washington veto it because it was unconstitutional and introduced principles that were liable to be abused in the future.The Papers of George Washington Contrary to Jefferson and Randolph, both Knox and Hamilton urged that he approve the bill. Knox argued on April 3 that the Constitution was unclear about \\"whether the numbers of representatives shall be apportioned on the aggregate number of all the people of the United States, or on the aggregate numbers of the people of each state.\\" As the constitutionality of the bill was, Knox said, \\"only doubted not proved but the equity of the measure apparent, it would appear rather a delicate measure for the President to decide the question contrary to the bill as passed.\\" Hamilton wrote Washington on the following day that, while he had not yet read the bill, it seemed to him that the bill \\"performs every requisition of the constitution; and it will not be denied that it performs this in the manner most consistent with equality.\\" Like Knox, Hamilton believed that \\"In cases where two constructions may reasonably be adopted, and neither can be pronounced inconsistent with the public good, it seems proper that the legislative sense should prevail\\" and the bill should be signed into law. =Veto= After considering both sides of the argument, Washington decided that Jefferson and Randolph were correct, and Washington agreed that the bill was unconstitutional. Even so, Washington feared that by vetoing it he would increase geographical tensions by siding with the south, as Jefferson and Randolph were both from Virginia. Further discussion with Randolph, Jefferson, and James Madison, however, allayed Washington's concerns, and on April 5, the president decided to return the bill to the House of Representatives with the two objections that \\"there is no one proportion or divisor which, applied to the respective numbers of the States will yield the number and allotment of representatives proposed by the Bill\\" and that \\"the Bill has allotted to eight of the States, more than one [representative] for thirty thousand.\\" Second bill After receiving Washington's veto message, Congress decided on April 10, 1792 to apportion representatives at \\"the ratio of one for every thirty-three thousand persons in the respective States\\". Washington signed the revised bill into law on April 14, 1792.

He reigned during the opening stages of the decline and fragmentation of the empire, which would ultimately pave the way for Turkoman atabegates and principalities stretching from Kerman to Anatolia and Syria.  Name  \\"Berkyaruq\\" is a Turkic word meaning \\"firm, unwavering light\\". Contrary to their Ghaznavid predecessors‚Äîwho had largely abandoned their Turkic heritage in favour of Persian‚Äîthe Seljuks maintained and took pride in their origins, carrying Turkic names such as Berkyaruq, Arslan Arghu or Sanjar.  Background  Born in 1079 or 1080, Berkyaruq was the oldest son of Malik-Shah I and the latters cousin, the Seljuk princess Zubaida Khatun. Berkyaruq was only thirteen at the time of his father's death on November 1092, meaning that there were no princes of age to inherit such as a vast empire. His half- brother Muhammad was eleven, while another half-brother named Mahmud was four. A brother of Malik-Shah named Tutush I, who ruled Syria on his brothers behalf, claimed the throne as the only adult, but gained little support from the Turkic elite. Malik-Shah's death thus marks the start of the decline and fragmentation of the empire, with amirs and palace elites trying each to gain power by supporting one of his young sons as sultan. One of Malik-Shah's wives, Terken Khatun, in cooperation with the Seljuk vizier Taj al-Mulk, installed her four year old son Mahmud on the throne at Baghdad. She convinced the caliph to have the khutba read in Mahmud's name, and sent an army under the amir Qiwam al-Dawla Kirbuqa to take Isfahan and capture Berkyaruq. Meanwhile, the family and supporters of the deceased Seljuk vizier Nizam al- Mulk (known as the \\"Nizamiyya\\"), led by Er-Ghush, supported Berkyaruq. They had Berkyaruq smuggled out of Isfahan and sent to his atabeg Gumushtigin in Saveh and Aveh, who had him crowned at Ray.  Reign  Although Berkyaruq was generally supported by the Nizamiyya, \\"this does not necessarily imply that the Nizamiyya had a collective policy, for none of the sons of Nizam al-Mulk was his father's equal in ability, and opportunism and personal factors seem often to have swayed them\\" (Bosworth). The Nizamiyya were most importantly looking to seek vengeance against Taj al-Mulk, who was believed to have been behind Nizam al-Mulk's death (which according to modern historian A. C. S. Peacock, was probably partly true). A battle took place between the two factions on January 1093, resulting in the defeat of Mahmud's supporters and the capture of Taj al-Mulk. Berkyaruq, aware of Taj al-Mulk's bureaucratic prowess, was willing to make him his vizier. Taj al-Mulk had even managed to appease a section of the Nizamiyya through bribery; still this was not enough; the Nizamiyya, thirsty for revenge, secured his execution on 12 February. Terken Khatun soon summoned the Seljuk prince Ismail ibn Yaquti to attack Berkyaruq. Although the former had raised an army of Turkmen from Azerbaijan and Arran, he was defeated and executed by Berkyaruq's atabeg Gumush-Tegin. Terken Khatun then tried to reach out to Tutush, but suddenly died in 1094, with her sickly son Mahmud following her a month later. Berkyaruq also had deal to with his uncle Tutush, who invaded the Jazira and western Iran, seizing the city of Ray. He was, however, killed by Berkyaruq's forces near the same city on 25 February 1095. Berkyaruq thus managed to consolidate his authority in western Iran and Iraq, and was also acknowledged as the sultan by the caliph. During the chaos that ensued, Malik-Shah's brother Arghun Arslan captured several cities in Khurasan (except Nishapur), attempting to establish his own principality in the province. Berkyaruq first sent an army under his uncle Bori-Bars ibn Alp-Arslan in 1095 to conquer Khurasan, but the latter was captured and killed. He sent a second army under his half-brother Ahmad Sanjar in 1097, but before anything occurred Arghun Arslan was killed by one his own ghulams, due to his brutal treatment of his subjects. Berkyaruq appointed Sanjar as the vassal ruler of Khurasan, giving him his own atabeg (Amir Qumaj) and vizier (al-Tughrai). However, Mahmud I was not the only Seljuk claimant to the throne, several other Seljuk princes such as Arslan-Argun, Muhammad I Tapar, and Tutush I, also claimed the throne. In 1105, Berkyaruq died in Borujerd, and was succeeded by his son Malik-Shah II.  Affairs of the Empire During His Reign  During Berkyaruq's short reign, he had five viziers, three of them were the children of Nizam al-Mulk: Izz al-Mulk Husain, Mu'ayyid al- Mulk and Fakhr al-Mulk. The two other viziers were Abd-al-Dihistani Jalil and Khatir al-Mulk Abu Mansur Maybudi. During his reign, Berkyaruq mostly focused on a way to find money to keep the expenses of the state.

The blackface minstrel troupe Buckley's Serenaders saw great success there until 1846. Christy's Minstrels became the resident minstrel company in February 1847, buying the building later in 1847. They remained until July 1854, when the troupe disbanded. Bryants Minstrels played at Mechanics' Hall for the first time in 1857, leaving after May, 1866, when the house was taken over for a season by minstrel showman Charles \\"Charlie\\" White.New York Clipper, July 7, 1866. In 1867, showman Robert Butler took over management of Mechanics' Hall following a fire that destroyed his former theater at 444 Broadway. Butler's luck was no better in the new venue as Mechanics' Hall was also destroyed by fire later that year.(8 April 1868).

Onion and garlic can also be used to intensify the dressing‚Äôs flavor. A variety of Italian dressing known as creamy Italian consists of the same ingredients, but with milk products and stabilizers added to make the salad dressing creamy. It is often bought bottled, or prepared by mixing oil and vinegar with a packaged flavoring mix consisting of dehydrated vegetables and herbs. Italian dressing is not used in Italy, where salad is normally dressed with olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, salt, and sometimes balsamic vinegar at the table, and not with a pre-mixed vinaigrette. Italian dressing is also used as a marinade for meat or vegetables, for stir-frys, and on sandwiches. Pasta salads sometimes include Italian dressing. The caloric content of Italian dressing varies widely. History =Ken's= North American style Italian salad dressing is thought to date back to 1941 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Florence Hanna, the daughter of Italian immigrants and wife of restaurateur Ken Hanna, made large batches of her family's salad dressing for the house salads at the restaurant. The restaurant, originally called The '41 Cafe, later changed locations and became known as Ken's Steak House. The salad dressing became so popular that it was made in large vats in the basement of Ken's to keep up with demand. Customers started requesting the Italian dressing to go. The Crowley family, who owned a nearby manufacturing business, approached the Hanna family about bottling the popular salad dressing. This resulted in the creation of Ken's Salad Dressing, which now comes in several variations of Italian, as well as many other flavors. =Wish-Bone= Italian salad dressing was also served in Kansas City, Missouri, at the Wishbone Restaurant beginning in 1948. The Wishbone had been opened in 1945 by Phillip Sollomi along with Lena Sollomi, Phillip's mother. The Italian dressing served at the Wishbone was based on a recipe from Lena Sollomi's Sicilian family which was a blend of oil, vinegar, herbs and spices. Demand for the salad dressing proved so high that Phillip started a separate operation to produce it for sale, making it by the barrel. The dressing recipe was eventually purchased by Lipton and has been made commercially by a succession of owners since, with the product currently made by Pinnacle Foods, Inc.

They serve as the latest and best of a model's portfolio and are used as a business card. A Z-CARD is also a folded leaflet format, typically used for marketing communications campaigns for example a loyalty programme or seasonal promotion. History Peter Marlowe in London invented models composites in 1965, then printed on paper to A4 format.\\"Model\\" (1995) by Michael Gross p. 284Barbara Molyneux (April 1989 & May 1989) Marlowe Press - The Story, Model Journal, p. 3 The format was changed in 1972 to A5 card format, for filing purposes, and a few other companies started publishing cards for the model industry under different trade names since Peter Marlowe had registered the trademark \\"Model Composite\\" in Europe and the USA. Amongst these was Sebastian Sed who traded under the name Sed Cards, which are sometimes mis-pronounced as Z (\\"Zed\\") or Set cards. The publishing house of Marlowe Press stopped trading in 1990 and the words \\"models composites\\" and \\"comp cards\\" became generic within the model industry. Comp card databases and creation tools have moved online in recent years. Format A comp card typically contains a minimum of two pages ‚Äì a cover page with full size portrait and a second page with a selection of representative shots from the portfolio. It lists the model's basic stats - typically height, weight, three sizes (bust, waist, hips) for women, suit or chest size and waist and inseam sizes for men, plus shoe size, eye and hair color, nationality and contact information. It is printed on both sides of an 8.5\\" x 5.5\\" https://www.businessofmodeling.com/comp-cards/what-is- a-comp-card/ piece of card stock (12 pt stock) (US) or A5 on card weight (350/400 g/m2 stock in metric countries) which is between 300 and 450 Œºm thick depending on the card stock or quality chosen (Europe, Asia). Use Comp cards have been around for many years as the essential marketing tool for a model and are likely to retain this standing because they are an inexpensive way to effectively and professionally showcase a model's ability. Composite cards are used on three major levels - they are used by models, agents and the agent's client Production Currently, models have many different options of creating comp cards. They can ask their photographer or create their own on their computers using image editing or graphics software. In addition, with technology's increasingly strong influence in the digital market, many printing companies have looked to the internet to facilitate the ordering process. Comp card printing prices can vary depending on the number of pictures used on the card, the type of paper stock used, and the general printing quality. Different layout styles are available or can be created. Notes * \\"Model Woman\\" (2015) by Robert Lacey p. 199,200,206,207.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 26, 2006. This is the first episode that centers on Groundskeeper Willie. The title and plot are based on the Broadway musical and film My Fair Lady. Plot When Mrs. Pummelhorst (the school gym teacher) announces that she will be leaving to undergo gender reassignment surgery and will come back as the shop teacher \\"Mr. Pummelhorst,\\" Coach Krupt, a substitute, takes her place. Every gym class, he has the students play a game called \\"Bombardment,\\" which consists of him throwing dodgeballs at the students. When Bart gets sick of the constant bullying, he fills a ball full of water and sticks it in the freezer overnight. The next day, he tries to throw the frozen ball at Coach Krupt, who ducks; the ball crashes through the window and destroys Willie's shack. When Marge picks up Bart from school and sees Willie is homeless, she offers to let him stay at their house, and he eventually accepts. When there, Lisa has Willie realize that his life could be much better, and she decides to turn him into a proper gentleman. Bart, however, does not believe that she can do it, but Lisa bets that she can in time for the school science fair. Meanwhile, Homer comes home with his last pair of blue pants ripped and torn after his seat breaks at the go-cart track. As he searches through town for a new pair, he finds no store that sells his favorite type of pants. When he goes to the factory that sells them, the manager tells him that they do not make blue pants anymore due to poor sales thanks to a disastrous Super Bowl ad. Homer tells him that he will get more customers. He does this by writing \\"Buy blue pants\\" on the back of his head. Homer's advertising campaign pays off and soon everyone is wearing blue pants. However, Marge is annoyed when Homer begins putting other advertisements all over his body. Lisa struggles to teach Willie how to act sophisticated. On the day before the science fair, he is still his same old self, but when he sees how disappointed Lisa is, he suddenly surprises both Bart and Lisa by correctly (and with a 'proper' accent) saying a sentence she gave him. At the science fair the next day, he impresses everyone with his politeness and verbal dexterity under the guise of G.K. Willington Esq. No one actually knows that it is the old groundskeeper until Lisa announces it to everyone. Once again, she wins the science fair, and the bet along with it. Even though he is respected by everybody, Willie misses his old life and feels out of place working as the maitre d' at a fancy restaurant; unfortunately, both his job and his shack were taken by the music teacher. He explains to Lisa that he wishes to go back to the way things were, and she understands. Soon, he is returned to his restored \\"crap shack\\", which Lisa has decorated with a new sign on the inside wall reading \\"Home Sweet Home.\\" Willie, acting very grateful for the gift, asks to be alone. Lisa understands and promptly exits the shack. Upon her leaving, Willie takes the sign and smashes it on the ground, declaring that he liked his shack \\"the way it was\\". Cultural references The episode's plot is based on My Fair Lady and also features parodies of songs from the play such as \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\", \\"The Rain in Spain\\", \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\", \\"On the Street Where You Live\\", and (briefly) \\"Get Me to the Church on Time\\". The blue pants advertisement seen in the subplot of this episode is a parody of the 1995 Calvin Klein advertisements that were considered creepy by many for their leering, pornographic nature. The wood panelling and the ladder mimic the set seen in the advertisement.

Kiritsis (August 13, 1932 ‚Äì January 28, 2005) was an American kidnapper. Kiritsis was a resident of Indianapolis, Indiana, and had fallen behind on mortgage payments for a piece of real estate. In early February 1977, when his mortgage broker Richard O. Hall refused to give him additional time to pay, Kiritsis became convinced that Hall and Hall‚Äôs father wanted the property. The property‚Äôs value had increased and could be sold at a high profit. Hall claimed that he had proof of this in writing. Crime The Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of Kiritsis holding a shotgun to Richard Hall's head On Tuesday February 8, 1977, Kiritsis went to Hall's office and wired the muzzle of a sawed-off shotgun to the back of Hall‚Äôs head. The wire was also connected to the trigger and the other end was connected to Hall's neck. This \\"dead man's line\\" meant that if a policeman shot Kiritsis the shotgun would go off and shoot Hall in the head. The same would happen if Hall tried to escape. Kiritsis called the police from Hall's office and told them that he had taken Hall as a hostage. Kiritsis held Hall hostage for 63 hours. During this time, most of which was spent in Kiritsis's apartment, he made frequent calls to radio station WIBC (1070 AM) newsman Fred Heckman, who broadcast what Kiritsis said. Finally, a lawyer said Hall had signed a document stating that he had mistreated Kiritsis and would pay him $5 million. The document also stated that Kiritsis would not be prosecuted or even arrested. Kiritsis then made a speech in front of live TV cameras declaring himself \\"a goddamned national hero.\\" His speech became so emotional that some journalists thought he would shoot Hall, so they terminated the live broadcast. Eventually however, Kiritsis released Hall. He fired the shotgun into the air to prove it had been loaded and was immediately arrested. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Most people who knew Kiritsis had good things to say about him and were surprised at what he had done. Kiritsis is described as \\"always helpful and kind to his neighbors, a hard worker and a strict law-and-order sort of man\\". Kiritsis also said several times that he did not want anyone to get hurt and apologized for the way he had treated Dick Hall. At his trial, psychiatrists said he was psychotic and in a \\"paranoid delusional state\\" during the hostage incident. Later life Kiritsis was released from a mental institution in January 1988, after the state could not prove he was still a danger to society. Kiritsis died in January 2005 at his home of natural causes. He was 72 years old. Effects of the case *At the time of the trial, Indiana law (and that of some other states) required the prosecution to disprove a defendant's claim of insanity, i.e. to prove the defendant sane, beyond a reasonable doubt. Directly as a result of the Kiritsis trial‚Äîparticularly the testimony of chief defense psychiatrist Larry M. Davis‚Äîand the trial of John Hinckley Jr., Indiana and other states substantially revised their law to place the burden of proof for insanity- pleading defendants squarely on the shoulders of the defense.Tony Kiritsis Case .

Their music has also been used in the soundtracks for Into the Fire, an independent film by Michael Phelan, and the New York restaurant documentary Eat This New York. History Their name is derived from the historic New York political organization Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall NYC formed in 1997, and soon began playing in local New York clubs. The group gained a strong local following, releasing their first album, Getawayland in 1999 under the independent label Glass Records. The following year they released Back In The Bottle, an acoustic album that had more of a folk music influence than its predecessor. The use of the song \\"Always on Sunday\\" in an HBO advertisement and \\"Wait for You\\" (a remix of \\"Wait for Jane\\") during the 2002 season of Sex and the City are largely responsible for the album's success. Also, the songs \\"Cindy\\", \\"To the Woman\\" and \\"Someone\\" have been used on the NBC show Scrubs. Buddy, their third album, was released in February 2003, and saw them returning to the louder mix of punk and alternative rock that had characterized their debut. The song \\"To the Woman,\\" from this album, was featured on Scrubs on January 17, 2006. \\"Cindy,\\" a re-recorded version of the song originally from Back In The Bottle, was also played on Scrubs in October 2003. Later in 2003, the soundtrack to Eat This New York was released, which showed a wide range of Latin and jazz influences on the band's part. In December 2003 Tammany Hall NYC performed live for the Howard Dean fundraiser at the Roseland Ballroom in New York, where Dean greeted them personally. In July 2005, the band released Marathon, which was their last studio album. On May 16, 2006, they also released the soundtrack of Into The Fire. On May 24, 2006, the 2003-recorded version of \\"Cindy\\" reached number 99 on the top 100 singles on iTunes, from the newly released soundtrack to Scrubs (volume 2).

It becomes necessary when film or video that was not originally designed for widescreen is shown on a widescreen display, or a narrower widescreen image is displayed within a wider aspect ratio, such as a 16:9 image in a 2.39:1 frame (common in cinemas). The original material is shrunk and placed in the middle of the widescreen frame. Some older arcade games that had a tall vertical and short horizontal are displayed in pillarbox even on 4:3 televisions. Some early sound films made 1928‚Äì1931, such as City Lights, were filmed in an even narrower format to make room for the sound-on-film track on then-standard film stock. These will appear pillarboxed even on 4:3 screens. Pillarboxing is the vertical equivalent of letterboxing and is sometimes called reverse letterboxing. Its name is derived from its resemblance to pillar box-style mailboxes used in the UK and the Commonwealth of Nations. The four-direction equivalent is called windowboxing, caused when programming is both letterboxed and pillarboxed. In order to use the entire screen area of a widescreen display (which is already significantly less than a fullscreen of equal diagonal measurement), and to prevent a reverse screen burn-in on plasma displays, the simplest alternative to pillarboxing is to crop the top and bottom. However, this results in the loss of some of the image within what the producer assumed would be the safe area. This overscan may or may not bother the viewer, but it often cuts-off the channel banner or other on-screen displays. Likewise, the vertical equivalent of pan and scan is called \\"tilt and scan\\" or \\"reverse pan and scan\\". This moves the cropped \\"window\\" up and down, however it is rarely done. A third option is to stretch the video to fill the screen, but this is often considered ugly, as it severely distorts everything on the screen. Because certain screen resolutions can be used for both fullscreen and widescreen (anamorphic), widescreen signaling (such as the Active Format Descriptor) must be used to tell the display device which to use, or the viewer must set it manually, in order to prevent unnecessary pillarboxing or stretching on widescreen displays. Stylized pillarboxing on television Some high-definition television networks and TV stations use \\"stylized pillarboxing\\", meaning they fill-in the blank areas on the sides with their HD logo or other still or motion graphics, when the program being shown is only available in 4:3 aspect ratio (standard definition). The use of graphics assures viewers that they are watching the HD version of a channel, instead of their thinking they are watching the SD version, along with filling the entire screen with a video image rather than the regular black bars. This also tells widescreen television sets with automatic resizing not to stretch the video, and instead to present it in the proper aspect ratio (although conversely, this may cause fullscreen SDTV sets and analog cable TV headends to horizontally compress or to windowbox the video). Vertical video with 'echo' pillarboxing A limited amount of local stations also apply custom pillarboxes, but most have removed them with both the advent of all-HD schedules and customer complaints about erroneous technical information in PSIP data. Some TV shows present an \\"echo\\" of the edges of the program video in the sidebars, usually blurred. Local television stations in the U.S. typically use graphics or a simple color gradient for electronic news- gathering packages shown on their local news programs. Until equipment replacement withdrew the majority of SD cameras from news organizations, portable ENG cameras were often not able to shoot in HD (due to their number and expense), though the studio cameras were in high definition. Some channels have a similar format called \\"enhanced HD\\", in which extra informative graphics and text is shown on the side, such as expanded stock quotes, charts, and graphs on CNBC HD+ in the past. Some Japanese anime switched from SD to HD during their run. Sometimes a flashback to a scene produced in SD had to be shown. For instance, in Naruto, the image of Naruto and Sasuke filled in the blank gaps as one of the SD-era flashbacks is being shown. Also, in the Family Guy episode \\"Back to the Pilot\\", Brian and Stewie travel back in time to when the show first premiered, in 1999. To show that, back then, they produced episodes in standard-definition, the entire scene was pillarboxed. In the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Squid Noir\\", when Squidward discovers that his clarinet was stolen, the episodes coloring changes to black and white. To show that, back then, many films in black-and-white were filmed in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, the black-and-white scenes were pillarboxed.

The book was released in the UK in January 2004, published by HarperCollins. Plot summary Exiled from Rome by the new Dictator, Sulla, Gaius Julius Caesar is serving with a naval legion. After playing a crucial part in liberating a Roman fort in Mytilene under the command of rebels, Julius receives the honour wreath and increases his standing among his men yet further. Despite this success, his war galley is attacked and captured by pirates, with Julius himself receiving a serious head injury. The alliance between Mithridates and the pirates of Cilicia, forged during the Second Mithridatic War, allowed piracy to thrive in the Mediterranean. Julius' household fares no better with its head serving at sea: Cornelia, Julius' wife is assaulted by Sulla despite being heavily pregnant. Julius and Cornelia's daughter is born and named Julia in honour of her father. Marcus Brutus meanwhile has finished his term with a legion in Macedon and is causing trouble with the locals on his return journey to Rome. He and Renius manage to meet jealous husbands and vindictive fathers before returning to the city. In the city itself, Julius' estate manager Tubruk swears revenge on Sulla and schemes to sell himself back into slavery in order to enter Sulla's household. Tubruk then successfully poisons Sulla before managing to escape the city before he can be traced. Antonidus, Sulla's right-hand, promises to track down Sulla's killer and tears Rome apart in his search. As Julius and the survivors of his galley gradually recover while detained on the pirates' ship, their captors demand a ransom. While the men attempt to negotiate lower ransom prices, Julius demands a much high price than the one proposed, defying the pirates and declaring that he will re-claim whatever is paid anyway. Eventually the survivors are left on the north African coast when the ransoms are paid. After returning to Rome and the estate where he and Julius grew up, Brutus asks Tubruk for the whereabouts of his mother, Servilia. After visiting her home, he gradually comes to know the woman who abandoned him as a child, as well as forming a reluctant acceptance of her life. In delight of her new- found relationship with her son, Servilia uses her influence with Crassus, one of the richest men in the Senate, to re-form the legion of Marius (Primigenia) under Brutus' command. Antonidus believes he has narrowed down the list of culprits for Sulla's murder to three: Cinna, father of Cornelia; Crassus; or Pompey, a renowned general and rising star in the Senate. With the backing of Cato, one of the most powerful men in the Senate, Antonidus hires an assassin to kill a loved one of each of the three. Pompey is the first to suffer Antonidus' misplaced vengeance, with his daughter murdered in Pompey's garden. Marching across north Africa, Julius calls for volunteers and, where necessary, presses young men into service to assist in the finding and destruction of the pirates. Risking the wrath of the Roman authorities with Ciro, one of Julius' recruits, accidentally killing a soldier and then Julius and his men stealing a ship, the small force sets out to find the survivors and recover their ransom money. Eventually the pirates are found and destroyed, with a huge hoard found on the pirate's ship, and Julius resolves to land in Greece and return to Rome. Upon landing in Greece, Julius discovers several Roman forts lying destroyed with their inhabitants killed, and learns not only of the return of Mithridates, but also of the death of Sulla. While Cato and the supporters of Sulla delay the Senate's decision to appoint a leader to confront Mithridates, Julius decides to confront Mithridates himself, and recruits many surviving veterans to fight alongside him, calling them the Wolves of Rome. Conducting several major hit-and-run attacks on Mithridates' forces, the Wolves eventually defeat the forces of Mithridates before the forces sent by the Senate even arrive in Greece. After delivering Mithridates' body to the approaching legions, Julius leads the Wolves to Rome and finally returned home. While home at his estate Julius meets his daughter Julia for the first time and learns of Sulla's assault on his wife. In his fury he comes close to killing Tubruk, one of his oldest friends, before learning Tubruk was Sulla's killer. Swearing revenge on Sulla's associates and followers, Julius publicly allies himself with Crassus and Pompey, who publicly denounces Cato as responsible for his daughters death. Tension also flares briefly between Julius and Brutus when Julius demands Brutus hand over Primigenia to him, until Brutus acquiesces and puts his friendship above his pride. Julius' marriage also suffers, with Cornelia feeling increasingly ignored by Julius. When Cato's son is forcibly signed up to Primigenia and is forbidden to withdraw from his service, Julius gathers another opponent. Crisis strikes Rome again when a gladiator known as Spartacus leads a slave revolt and destroys two legions in the north. Infighting in the Senate leads to indecision as to who will lead the legions north leads to Crassus being given command, despite his perceived lack of skill as a general. Knowing this, Crassus makes Pompey his second in command and Pompey responds by summoning Julius and Primigenia. Primigenia marches north and performs admirably, though it is forcibly merged with another legion. Julius remains in command of the newly formed legion, and names it the Tenth. Tragedy strikes Julius before he can see the end of the campaign. Cornelia is murdered on Cato's orders, with Tubruk dying trying to protect her. Julius returns to his estate with Pompey and Brutus, and Pompey discovers Cato's involvement in the murders of Cornelia and his daughter. Cato however commits suicide before he can be executed. A grief-stricken Julius returns to his troops in time to see Spartacus and the slave revolt crushed. Pompey however begins to see Julius as a threat and arranges for him to take up a position in Spain. Differences from historical persons Although it is a work of fiction, many of the characters and events are based on historical sources. Iggulden added a historical note to the book in which he explains the differences between his novel and history. In particular, the dictator Cornelius Sulla, who was based on the dictator Sulla, is shown to have been murdered; in reality, Sulla apparently died in retirement of his excesses. Sulla's loyal general appears to have been based on Lucullus. It should also be noted that the person known as Cato in this novel and his life bears little to no resemblance to the historical Cato the Younger who was Caesar's political opponent from about 60 BC. Nor was Servilia a high-class prostitute as she is shown in the novel; according to most historical sources, she was twice married and committed adultery only with Caesar himself. She was a wealthy and well-respected Roman matron in this particular decade of Roman history (when Caesar was under thirty). Caesar did not distinguish himself through a march through Africa (something that Cato Uticensis did shortly before he committed suicide). Some of his earlier military exploits are attributable to other Roman commanders. Another inaccuracy: Caesar serves on board the War Galley as a non-commissioned officer (tesserarius) reporting to a centurion. The Julii were member of the Patrician class who started their military service as Tribunes. Only Plebeians would have served in such a low rank.

Bartol first started to conceive the novel in the early 1930s, when he lived in Paris. In the French capital, he met with the Slovene literary critic Josip Vidmar, who introduced him to the story of Hassan-i Sabbah. A further stimulation for the novel came from the assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia perpetrated by Croatian and Bulgarian radical nationalists, on the alleged commission of the Italian Fascist government. When it was originally published, the novel was sarcastically dedicated to Benito Mussolini. The maxim of the novel is \\"Nothing is an absolute reality; all is permitted\\". This book was one of the inspirations for the video game series Assassin's Creed. Plot The novel is set in the 11th century at the fortress of Alamut, which was seized by the leader of the Ismailis, Hassan-i Sabbah or Sayyiduna (ÿ≥€åÿØŸÜÿß, \\"Our Master\\"). At the start of the story, he is gathering an army for the purpose of attacking the Seljuk Empire, which has taken over possession of Iran. The story opens from the point of view of Halima who was purchased by Hassan to become a houri. The story commences with the journey of young ibn Tahir, who is, according to his family's wish, intending to join the Alamut garrison. There, he is appointed to the squad of the most valiant soldiers, named the fedai (ŸÅÿØÿßÿ¶€å). Fedai are expected to obey orders without demur and forfeit their lives if necessary. During their demanding training, they come to be convinced that they shall go to heaven immediately after their death if they die in the line of duty. Meanwhile, Halima joins the other houris in the garden which Hassan has been building, the young girls are educated in various arts by the leader of the houris and confidant to Hassan, Miriam. Hassan managed to achieve such level of obedience by deceiving his soldiers; he gave them drugs (hashish) to numb them and afterwards ordered that they be carried into the gardens behind the fortress‚Äîwhich were made into a simulacrum of heaven, including houris. Therefore, fedayin believe that Allah has given Hassan the power to send anybody to Heaven for a certain period. Moreover, some of the fedayin fall in love with houris, and Hassan unscrupulously uses that to his advantage. Meanwhile, the Seljuk army besieges Alamut. Some of the soldiers are captured and Hassan decides to demonstrate his power to them. He orders a pair of fedayin (Yusuf and Suleiman) to kill themselves; Suleiman by stabbing himself, Yusuf by jumping off a tower. They gladly fulfill their master's order since they believe that they will soon rejoice with their beloved in heaven. After the siege, Hassan orders ibn Tahir to go and kill the grand vizier of the Seljuk sultan Nizam al-Mulk. Hassan wants to take revenge for al-Mulk's treachery against him long ago. Ibn Tahir stabs the vizier, but, before he passes away, the vizier reveals the truth of Hassan's deceptions to his murderer. Upon hearing of his success, Hassan informs Miriam that Ibn Tahir is likely dead as a result of discovery, Miriam commits suicide from her disillusionment. Halima also commits suicide when she learn she will never be with Suleiman whom she fell in love with. Ibn Tahir decides to return to Alamut and kill Hassan. When ibn Tahir returns, Hassan receives him and also reveals him his true motto: \\"Nothing is an absolute reality, all is permitted\\". Then, he lets ibn Tahir go, to start a long journey around the world. Another fedai kills the Seljuk Sultan and the Seljuk empire dissolves. The fight for the Seljuk throne begins. Hassan encloses himself in a tower, determined to work until the end of his days. He transfers the power over the Ismaelits to the hands of his faithful dai, military, and religious chiefs. Interpretations Some of the contemporaneous literary critics, such as Lino Legi≈°a, have interpreted it as an allegory of the TIGR, an organization formed in order to fight the Fascist Italianization in the former Austrian Littoral.Razmerje med Bartolovo kratko in dolgo prozo (Al Araf in Alamut), zbornik Obdobja, ≈°t. 23, (Slovenska kratka pripovedna proza, ur. Irena Novak- Popov, Ljubljana: FF, 2006, str. 137‚Äì44).O Bigginsovi interpretaciji Alamuta, 24. november 2004, namenjeno objavi v Slovene Studies). Allegedly, Vladimir Bartol had sympathised with said organisation. Another interpretation compares the Hashshashin to modern-day terrorists, particularly islamists and Hassan-i Sabbah to their leaders. Cultural impact The novel and its plot were the inspiration for the popular Assassin's Creed series of video games.\\"Interview: Assassin's Creed\\". CVG. Retrieved August 7, 2013. Many elements of the book's plot can be found in the first game, and the phrase from the novel under an alternative translation: \\"nothing is true; everything is permitted\\" is the guiding principle of the game's Order of Assassins‚Äîwho are the fictionalized descendants of the Ismaili. The novel helped inspire the Assamite clan of the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop game. Author William S. Burroughs found fascination within the story of Hassan-i-Sabbah and included the motto, \\"Nothing is true; everything is permitted\\", and many references to the work in his 1959 post-modern novel, Naked Lunch and The Nova Express.

This emission may arise in molecular clouds, comets, planetary atmospheres, stellar atmospheres, or various other conditions in interstellar space. Background =Discrete transition energy= Like a laser, the emission from a maser is stimulated (or seeded) and monochromatic, having the frequency corresponding to the energy difference between two quantum- mechanical energy levels of the species in the gain medium which have been pumped into a non-thermal population distribution. However, naturally occurring masers lack the resonant cavity engineered for terrestrial laboratory masers. The emission from an astrophysical maser is due to a single pass through the gain medium and therefore generally lacks the spatial coherence and mode purity expected from a laboratory maser. =Nomenclature= Due to the differences between engineered and naturally occurring masers, it is often stated Masers, Lasers and the Interstellar Medium, Vladimir Strelnitski 1997, Astrophysics and Space Science, vol. 252, pp. 279‚Äì87 that astrophysical masers are not \\"true\\" masers because they lack oscillation cavities. The distinction between oscillator-based lasers and single-pass lasers was intentionally disregarded by the laser community in the early years of the technology,Biographical Memoirs V.83, National Academy of Sciences so the insistence by some in scientific circles upon the presence of an oscillation cavity as the distinguishing criterion for \\"maser\\" status seems somewhat arbitrary and contrived. This fundamental incongruency in language has resulted in the use of other paradoxical definitions in the field. For example, if the gain medium of a (misaligned) laser is emission-seeded but non-oscillating radiation, it is said to emit amplified spontaneous emission or ASE. This ASE is regarded as unwanted or parasitic (some researchers would add to this definition the presence of insufficient feedback or unmet lasing threshold): that is, the users wish the system to behave as a laser. The emission from astrophysical masers is, in fact, ASE but is sometimes termed superradiant emission to differentiate it from the laboratory phenomenon. This simply adds to the confusion, since both sources are superradiant. In some laboratory lasers, such as a single pass through a regeneratively amplified Ti:Sapph stage, the physics is directly analogous to an amplified ray in an astrophysical maser. Furthermore, the practical limits of the use of the m to stand for microwave in maser are variously employed. For example, when lasers were initially developed in the visible portion of the spectrum they were called optical masers.Infrared and Optical Masers, A. L. Schawlow and C. H. Townes 1958 Physical Review 112, 1940 Townes advocated that the m stand for molecule since energy states of molecules generally provide the masing transition.C. H. Townes Nobel Prize lecture Along these lines, some will use the term laser to describe any system which exploits an electronic transition and the term maser to describe a system which exploits a rotational or vibrational transition, regardless of the output frequency. Some astrophysicists use the term iraser to describe a maser emitting at a wavelength of a few micrometres,An ISO survey of possible water and hydroxyl IRASER transitions towards the star-forming regions W49, W3(OH) and Sgr B2M, M. D. Gray and J. A. Yates 1999 Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 310, 1153 even though the optics community has similar sources which they call lasers. The term taser has been used to describe laboratory masers in the terahertz regimeTASERs: Possible dc pumped terahertz lasers using interwell transitions in semiconductor heterostructures, A. N. Korotkov, D. V. Averin, and K. K. Likharev 1994 Applied Physics Letters 65, 1865 although astronomers might call these sub-millimeter masers and laboratory physicists generally call these gas lasers or specifically alcohol lasers in reference to the gain species. The electrical engineering community typically limits the use of the word microwave to frequencies roughly between 1 GHz and 300 GHz ‚Äì that is, wavelengths between 30 cm and 1 mm, respectively. =Astrophysical conditions= The simple existence of a pumped population inversion is not sufficient for the observation of a maser. For example, there must be velocity coherence along the line of sight so that Doppler shifting does not prevent inverted states in different parts of the gain medium from radiatively coupling. Also, while polarisation in laboratory lasers and masers may be achieved by selectively oscillating the desired modes, polarisation in natural masers will arise only in the presence of a polarisation-state dependent pump or of a magnetic field in the gain medium. Finally, the radiation from astrophysical masers can be quite weak and may escape detection due to the limited sensitivity (and relative remoteness) of astronomical observatories and due to the sometimes overwhelming spectral absorption from unpumped molecules of the maser species in the surrounding space. This latter obstacle may be partially surmounted through the judicious use of the spatial filtering inherent in interferometric techniques, especially very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The major use of maser study is that they give valuable information on the conditions in space, such as temperature, number density, magnetic field, and velocity, in the most interesting of environments ‚Äì including stellar birth and death, and the centres of galaxies containing black holes. The conditions involved in these events still need more accurate measuring so that theoretical models can be refined or revised. Discovery =Historical background= In 1965 an unexpected discovery was made by Weaver et al.: emission lines in space, of unknown origin, at a frequency of 1665 MHz. At this time many researchers still thought that molecules could not exist in space, even though they had been discovered by McKellar in the 1940s, and so the emission was at first attributed to an unknown form of interstellar matter named Mysterium, but the emission was soon identified as line emission from OH molecules in compact sources within molecular clouds. More discoveries followed, with H2O emission in 1969, CH3OH emission in 1970 and SiO emission in 1974, all coming from within molecular clouds. These were termed \\"masers\\", as from their narrow line-widths and high effective temperatures it became clear that these sources were amplifying microwave radiation. Masers were then discovered around highly evolved Late-type stars (named OH/IR stars). First was OH emission in 1968, then H2O emission in 1969 and SiO emission in 1974. Masers were also discovered in external galaxies in 1973, and in the Solar System in comet halos. Another unexpected discovery was made in 1982 with the discovery of emission from an extra-galactic source with an unrivalled luminosity about 106 times larger than any previous source. This was termed a megamaser because of its great luminosity; many more megamasers have since been discovered. A weak disk maser was discovered in 1995 emanating from the star MWC 349A, using NASA's Kuiper Airborne Observatory.Hydrogen Recombination Beta-Lines in MWC 349; C Thom, VS Strelnitski, J Martin-Pintado, HE Matthews, HA Smith; Astronomy and Astrophysics; v. 300, p.843 Evidence for an anti- pumped (dasar) sub-thermal population in the 4830 MHz transition of formaldehyde (H2CO) was observed in 1969 by Palmer et al. =Detection= The connections of maser activity with far Infra-red (FIR) emission has been used to conduct searches of the sky with optical telescopes (because optical telescopes are easier to use for searches of this kind), and likely objects are then checked in the radio spectrum. Particularly targeted are molecular clouds, OH-IR stars, and FIR active galaxies. =Known interstellar species= The following species have been observed in stimulated emission from astronomical environments: * OH * CH * H2CO * H2O * NH3, 15NH3 * CH3OH * HNCNHMcGuire et al. (2012), \\"Interstellar Carbodiimide (HNCNH) ‚Äì A New Astronomical Detection from the GBT PRIMOS Survey via Maser Emission Features.\\" The Astrophysical Journal Letters 758 (2): L33 arXiv:https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1590 * SiS * HC3N * SiO, 29SiO, 30SiO * HCN, H13CN * H (in MWC 349) * CS Characteristics of maser radiation The amplification or gain of radiation passing through a maser cloud is exponential. This has consequences for the radiation they produce: =Beaming= Small path differences across the irregularly shaped maser cloud become greatly distorted by exponential gain. Part of the cloud that has a slightly longer path length than the rest will appear much brighter (as it is the exponent of the path length that is relevant), and so maser spots are typically much smaller than their parent clouds. The majority of the radiation will emerge along this line of greatest path length in a \\"beam\\"; this is termed beaming. =Rapid variability= As the gain of a maser depends exponentially on the population inversion and the velocity-coherent path length, any variation of either will itself result in exponential change of the maser output. =Line narrowing= Exponential gain also amplifies the centre of the line shape (Gaussian or Lorentzian, etc.) more than the edges or wings. This results in an emission line shape that is much taller but not much wider. This makes the line appear narrower relative to the unamplified line. =Saturation= The exponential growth in intensity of radiation passing through a maser cloud continues as long as pumping processes can maintain the population inversion against the growing losses by stimulated emission. While this is so the maser is said to be unsaturated. However, after a point, the population inversion cannot be maintained any longer and the maser becomes saturated. In a saturated maser, amplification of radiation depends linearly on the size of population inversion and the path length. Saturation of one transition in a maser can affect the degree of inversion in other transitions in the same maser, an effect known as competitive gain. =High brightness= The brightness temperature of a maser is the temperature a black body would have if producing the same emission brightness at the wavelength of the maser. That is, if an object had a temperature of about 109K it would produce as much 1665-MHz radiation as a strong interstellar OH maser. Of course, at 109K the OH molecule would dissociate (kT is greater than the bond energy), so the brightness temperature is not indicative of the kinetic temperature of the maser gas but is nevertheless useful in describing maser emission. Masers have incredible effective temperatures, many around 109K, but some of up to 1012K and even 1014K. =Polarisation= An important aspect of maser study is polarisation of the emission. Astronomical masers are often very highly polarised, sometimes 100% (in the case of some OH masers) in a circular fashion, and to a lesser degree in a linear fashion. This polarisation is due to some combination of the Zeeman effect, magnetic beaming of the maser radiation, and anisotropic pumping which favours certain magnetic-state transitions. Many of the characteristics of megamaser emission are different. Maser environments =Comets= Comets are small bodies (5‚Äì15 km diameter) of frozen volatiles (H2O, CO2, NH3, CH4) embedded in a crusty silicate filler. They orbit the sun in eccentric orbits and as they approach the sun the volatiles vaporise to form a halo, and later a tail, around the nucleus. Once vaporised these molecules can form inversions and mase. The impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 resulted in maser emissions in the 22 GHz region from the water molecule.Cosmovici, C. B.; Montebugnoli, S.; Pogrebenko, S.; Colom, P. Water MASER Detection at 22 GHz after the SL-9/Jupiter Collision, Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society Despite the apparent rarity of these events, observation of the intense maser emission has been suggested as a detection scheme for extrasolar planets.Radio Search for Extrasolar Cometary Impacts at 22 Ghz (water Maser Emission), Catastrophic Events Conference, 2000 Ultraviolet light from the sun breaks down some H2O molecules forming OH molecules that can mase. In 1997, 1667-MHz maser emission from the OH molecule was observed from comet Hale-Bopp.Ogley R.N., Richards A.M.S., Spencer R.E. \\"A Masing Hale-Bopp\\", Irish Astr. J., 1997, 24, 97 =Planetary atmospheres= It is predicted that masers exist in the atmospheres of gas giant planets, e.g. . Such masers would be highly variable due to planetary rotation (10-hour period for Jovian planets). Cyclotron masers have been detected at the north pole of Jupiter. =Planetary systems= In 2009, S. V. Pogrebenko et al.S. V. Pogrebenko et al., A&A;, 494, L1‚ÄìL4 (2009) reported the detection of water masers in the plumes of water associated with the Saturnian moons Hyperion, Titan, Enceladus, and Atlas. =Stellar atmospheres= Pulsations of the Mira variable S Orionis, showing dust production and masers (ESO) The conditions in the atmospheres of late- type stars support the pumping of different maser species at different distances from the star. Due to instabilities within the nuclear burning sections of the star, the star experiences periods of increased energy release. These pulses produce a shockwave that forces the atmosphere outward. Hydroxyl masers occur at a distance of about 1000 to 10000 astronomical units (AU), water masers at a distance of about 100 to 400 AU, and silicon monoxide masers at a distance of about 5 to 10 AU. Both radiative and collisional pumping resulting from the shockwave have been suggested as the pumping mechanism for the silicon monoxide masers. These masers diminish for larger radii as the gaseous silicon monoxide condenses into dust, depleting the available maser molecules. For the water masers, the inner and outer radii limits roughly correspond to the density limits for maser operation. At the inner boundary, the collisions between molecules are enough to remove a population inversion. At the outer boundary, the density and optical depth is low enough that the gain of the maser is diminished. Additionally, the hydroxyl masers are supported chemical pumping. At the distances where these masers are found water molecules are disassociated by UV radiation. =Star- forming regions= Young stellar objects and (ultra)compact H II regions embedded in molecular clouds and giant molecular clouds, support the bulk of astrophysical masers. Various pumping schemes ‚Äì both radiative and collisional and combinations thereof ‚Äì result in the maser emission of multiple transitions of many species. For example, the OH molecule has been observed to mase at 1612, 1665, 1667, 1720, 4660, 4750, 4765, 6031, 6035, and 13441 MHz. Water and methanol masers are also typical of these environments. Relatively rare masers such as ammonia and formaldehyde may also be found in star-forming regions. =Supernova remnants= WISE image of IC 443, a supernova remnant with maser emission The 1720 MHz maser transition of the OH molecule is known to be associated with supernova remnants that interact with molecular clouds. =Extragalactic sources= While some of the masers in star forming regions can achieve luminosities sufficient for detection from external galaxies (such as the nearby Magellanic Clouds), masers observed from distant galaxies generally arise in wholly different conditions. Some galaxies possess central black holes into which a disk of molecular material (about 0.5 parsec in size) is falling. Excitations of these molecules in the disk or in a jet can result in megamasers with large luminosities. Hydroxyl, water, and formaldehyde masers are known to exist in these conditions. Ongoing research Astronomical masers remain an active field of research in radio astronomy and laboratory astrophysics due, in part, to the fact that they are valuable diagnostic tools for astrophysical environments which may otherwise elude rigorous quantitative study and because they may facilitate the study of conditions which are inaccessible in terrestrial laboratories. =Variability= Maser variability is generally understood to mean the change in apparent brightness to the observer. Intensity variations can occur on timescales from days to years indicating limits on maser size and excitation scheme. However, masers change in various ways over various timescales. =Distance determinations= Masers in star-forming regions are known to move across the sky along with the material that is flowing out from the forming star(s). Also, since the emission is a narrow spectral line, line-of-sight velocity can be determined from the Doppler shift variation of the observed frequency of the maser, permitting a three-dimensional mapping of the dynamics of the maser environment. Perhaps the most spectacular success of this technique is the dynamical determination of the distance to the galaxy NGC 4258 from the analysis of the motion of the masers in the black-hole disk. Also, water masers have been used to estimate the distance and proper motion of galaxies in the Local Group, including that of the Triangulum Galaxy. VLBI observations of maser sources in late type stars and star forming regions provide determinations of their trigonometric parallax and therefore their distance. This method is much more accurate than other distance determinations, and gives us information about the galactic distance scale (e.g. the distance of spiral arms). =Open issues= Unlike terrestrial lasers and masers for which the excitation mechanism is known and engineered, the reverse is true for astrophysical masers. In general, astrophysical masers are discovered empirically then studied further in order to develop plausible suggestions about possible pumping schemes. Quantification of the transverse size, spatial and temporal variations, and polarisation state (typically requiring VLBI telemetry) are all useful in the development of a pump theory. Galactic formaldehyde masing is one such example that remains problematic. On the other hand, some masers have been predicted to occur theoretically but have yet to be observed in nature. For example, the magnetic dipole transitions of the OH molecule near 53 MHz are expected to occur but have yet to be observed, perhaps due to a lack of sensitive equipment.

Rowdy is the official mascot of the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys. Development and early years Rowdy was originally developed by NFL Properties in the early 1990s as a cowboy/football player character named \\"Big D\\" who was part of the Team NFL Heroes league-wide mascot program. Merchandise showing an early version of Rowdy with his name listed as Big D was marketed to children and teenagers during the 1994 and 1995 NFL seasons. Big D made public appearances at Cowboys games and other events as early as 1994 but wasn't adopted by the Cowboys as their official mascot until 1996 after his name was changed to Rowdy and adjustments to his character design had been made. Character design and appearance Rowdy wears a Dallas Cowboys' football uniform combined with classic western attire including an oversized cowboy hat, chaps, and cowboy boots. His jersey number is 00 (pronounced \\"double zero\\"). Role as mascot Rowdy has been the Cowboys' official mascot since 1996. His tenure overlapped with that of Crazy Ray who was the unofficial mascot of the Cowboys from 1962 until his death in 2007. As the Ambassador of the Dallas Cowboys, Rowdy's job includes, but is not limited to creating game day enthusiasm at AT&T; Stadium. He does this at home games by driving in on his four-wheeler, tossing t-shirts into the stands, using signs like \\"Let's Go Cowboys,\\" and mocking the opponents. Rowdy participates at every home game and selected away games. In 2015, Rowdy was named \\"Most Hated NFL Mascot\\" by Sports Illustrated. Community involvement Rowdy is involved with, takes part in, and/or makes appearances at the following: the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, The Salvation Army, The Rise School of Dallas, the Special Olympics, retirement centers, hospitals, schools, birthday parties, grand openings, Minor League Baseball games around the country, conventions, parades, grocery store promotions, Dallas Mavericks NBA games, weddings, and community events. He has even been to the Pro Bowl at least three times: in 1995 before being adopted by the Cowboys as their official mascot,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bizarre-nfl-mascots- from-1995-2013-12#/#not-all-of-the-mascots-disappeared-rowdy-the-dallas- cowboys-mascot-is-still-used-today-11 and in 1999 and 2001. He has also taken part in televised events, including ESPN's Alumni Beach Bowl, ABC's Battle of the Gridiron and the Special Olympics. Training camp promotions At Cowboys training camp Rowdy can be found playing with kids at Rowdy's Kid Zone. He takes the kids through obstacle courses and has them chant for their favorite Cowboys player during practice. Kids also visit the inflatable Cowboys Experience, which includes a bouncy house, slide, football toss, and field goal kick. Rowdy is known for squirting the kids with water guns, and anyone else who steps in his way like players, coaches, TV crews, and especially fans that come out to watch the Cowboys practice at camp. This is welcomed by fans when the outside temperature is 100 plus degrees. Mascot convention participation Rowdy represents the Cowboys each year in selected cities for the annual mascot convention. At this event the NFL mascots compare and share ideas to help continue mascot antics and ways to market mascot awareness.

Listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (), the company is involved in the creation and international distribution of television, feature films and ancillary products. The company has an extensive television program catalogue of over 5,000 hours and covers all genres including drama, feature films, comedy, children's, reality, and documentary programs. The company was formed in 1984 to produce the science and technology magazine program Beyond 2000, a commercial reworking of the program Towards 2000 which aired on the Australian public broadcaster ABC. Beyond 2000 was later rebooted in 2005 as Beyond Tomorrow. Other notable programming produced and/or distributed by Beyond include MythBusters, Deadly Women, Dance Moms, Beat Bugs, Highway Thru Hell and 800 Words. History The company was founded by producers Carmel Travers, Iain Finlay and Chris Ardill-Guinness, as well as consultant Phil Gerlach and accountant Mikael Borglund, briefly titled CIC Productions, initially with the intention of making only one program, Beyond 2000 after which the company took its name. The company took responsibility for distributing the series, finding success in selling the program overseas, including to Discovery Channel in America and an American adaptation for FOX. Early programs produced by Beyond include Just For the Record and Jack Thompson Down Under for Network Ten and Chances for the Nine Network. Beyond's relationship with Discovery Channel saw the company commissioned to produce a number of the channel's early programs, including a nine-season run of Invention and eventually the company's most successful program Mythbusters. In 2009, Beyond acquired distribution company Magna Pacific from receivership. In 2013, Beyond formed a joint venture with Seven West Media called 7Beyond to produce programs in North America. 7Beyond shows include My Lottery Dream Home and My Kitchen Rules.

It was constructed in 1978 and replaced the Pasco-Kennewick Bridge, an earlier span built in 1922 and demolished in 1990. The bridge is one of seven major bridge structures in the Tri-Cities area. The Blue Bridge (another Pasco/Kennewick bridge), the Interstate 182 Bridge that connects Pasco with Richland, the U.S. Highway 12 bridge over the Snake River (Pasco/Burbank), and three railroad bridges are the others. It was dedicated on September 8, 1978, and was the first major cable-stayed bridge to be built in the United States (and second-longest of its kind in the world at the time). It was constructed almost entirely of prestressed concrete, beginning with the towers and followed by the bridge deck, which was cast in individual segments, raised up and secured to each other. The bridge was named after Ed Hendler, a Pasco, Washington insurance salesman, as well as the city's former mayor, who headed up the committee responsible for obtaining the funding for construction of the bridge. Hendler died in August 2001. A controversial feature of the bridge was added in 1998, when lights were added to illuminate the bridge at night. Many thought this was unnecessary and a waste of both electricity and money. During a power crisis in 2000, the lights were turned off, but they were turned on for one night to honor Hendler's passing. Now the lights are turned on at night, and turned off at 2 am. In March 2007, the old guard rail system on the bridge, which consisted of steel cables, was replaced with a more rigid system, consisting of steel rails bolted to the original system's mounts on the bridge deck.  The bridge as a status symbol  The Cable Bridge, from the time of its opening, has proved to be a popular landmark in the Tri-City area, so much so it has become an unofficial symbol of the area. Every winter, an event known as the Lampson Cable Bridge Run, including mile, five-kilometer, and 10-kilometer foot races, starts at the Kennewick end of the bridge near the Lampson International headquarters. All three share the same starting line. The five- and 10-kilometer events share an indoor finish line at the Lampson Maintenance Shop, while the 1-mile has its own outdoor finish. At the foot of the Kennewick end is the Tri-Cities Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which has engraved on it the names of the area's dead.

It was a significant stage in the development of the modern novel as a form of popular literature in Western culture. History Punch, mocking the clich√©d language attributed to three-volume novels Three volume novels began to be produced by the Edinburgh-based publisher Archibald Constable in the early 19th century. Constable was one of the most significant publishers of the 1820s and made a success of publishing expensive, three-volume editions of the works of Walter Scott, the first being Scott's historical novel Kenilworth, published in 1821. This continued until Constable's company collapsed in 1826 with large debts, bankrupting both him and Scott. As Constable's company collapsed, the publisher Henry Colburn quickly adopted the format. The number of three-volume novels he issued annually rose from six in 1825 to 30 in 1828 and 39 in 1829. Under Colburn's influence, the published novels adopted a standard format of three volumes in octavo, priced at 31 shillings and sixpence. The price and format remained unaltered for nearly 70 years, until 1894. Three-volume novels quickly disappeared after 1894, when both Mudie's and W. H. Smith stopped purchasing them. Description The format of the three-volume novel does not correspond closely to what would now be considered a trilogy of novels. In a time when books were relatively expensive to print and bind, publishing longer works of fiction had a particular relationship to a reading public who borrowed books from commercial circulating libraries. A novel divided into three parts could create a demand (Part I whetting an appetite for Parts II and III). The income from Part I could also be used to pay for the printing costs of the later parts. Furthermore, a commercial librarian had three volumes earning their keep, rather than one. The particular style of mid-Victorian fiction, of a complicated plot reaching resolution by distribution of marriage partners and property in the final pages, was well adapted to the form. The standardized cost of a three volume novel was equivalent to half the weekly income of a modest, middle-class household. This cost was enough to deter even comparatively well-off members of the public from buying them. Instead, they were borrowed from commercial circulating libraries, the most well known being owned by Charles Edward Mudie. Mudie was able to buy novels for stock at about half the retail price ‚Äì five shillings per volume. He charged his subscribers one guinea (21 shillings) a year for the right to borrow one volume at a time. A subscriber who wished to borrow three volumes, in order to read the complete novel without having to make two additional trips to the library, had to pay a higher annual fee. Their high price meant both publisher and author could make a profit on the comparatively limited sales of such expensive books ‚Äì three volume novels were typically printed in editions of under 1000 copies, which were often pre-sold to subscription libraries before the book was even published. It was very unusual for a three-volume novel to sell more than 1000 copies. The system encouraged publishers and authors to produce as many novels as possible, due to the almost-guaranteed, but limited, profits that would be made on each. The normal three-volume novel was around 900 pages in total at 150‚Äì200,000 words; the average length was 168,000 words in 45 chapters. It was common for novelists to have contracts specifying a set number of pages to be filled. If they ran under, they could be made to produce extra, or break the text up into more chapters ‚Äî each new chapter heading would fill a page. In 1880, the author Rhoda Broughton was offered ¬£750 by her publisher for her two-volume novel Second Thoughts. However, he offered her ¬£1200 if she could add a third volume. Other forms of Victorian publication Outside of the subscription library system's three-volume novels, the public could access literature in the form of partworks - the novel was sold in around 20 monthly parts, costing one shilling each. This was a form used for the first publications of many of the works of Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope and William Thackeray. Many novels by authors such as Wilkie Collins and George Eliot were first published in serial form in weekly and monthly magazines that began to become popular in the middle of the 19th century. Publishers also offered cheap, reprint editions of many works, priced at one to two shillings. Although there was often a lengthy delay before reprint editions were released. Those who wished to access the latest books had no choice but to borrow three volume editions from a subscription library. The cheapest works of popular fiction were sometimes referred to pejoratively as penny dreadfuls. These were popular with young, working-class men, p.20 and often had sensationalist stories featuring criminals, detectives, pirates or the supernatural. 20th-century Though the era of the three volume novel effectively ended in 1894, works were still on occasion printed in more than one volume in the 20th-century. Two of John Cowper Powys's novels, Wolf Solent (1929) and Owen Glendower (1940) were published in two volume editions by Simon & Schuster in the USA. The Lord of the Rings is a three-volume novel, rather than a trilogy, as Tolkien originally intended the work to be the first of a two-work set, the other to be The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher. For economic reasons The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955. The three volumes were entitled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami has written several books in this format, such as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and 1Q84. However, many translations of the novel, such as into English, combine the three volumes of these novels into a single book.

Biography  Morin was raised in the Boston suburb of Wayland. He began drawing at age seven. As an avid watcher of the television cartoons of the day , Morin began to develop his own cartoon characters, some of which were registered in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office by his father, attorney Charles H. Morin. He attended the Rivers School in Weston, Massachusetts and Suffield Academy in Connecticut, and studied painting and drawing at Syracuse University under Jerome Witkin. \\"He was the only teacher I had who saw cartoons as paintings, as art,\\" Morin says. \\"Painting has made me more conscious.. . . My paintings affect my drawings and vice versa.\\"Bramson, Dara. \\"Crossover Cartoonist.\\" Miami Monthly, February, 2007. The Watergate scandal inspired Morin to explore the art of caricature. During his senior year at Syracuse, he was the editorial cartoonist for their daily student newspaper, The Daily Orange. Following college, Morin served a brief stint as the editorial cartoonist at The Beaumont Enterprise before moving on to Richmond, Virginia, where he spent one year as the editorial cartoonist at the Richmond Times-Dispatch. During his time in Richmond, Morin became a close professional acquaintance of Jeff MacNelly, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist at the Richmond News Leader. Upon MacNelly's passing in 2000, Morin accepted the invitation of colleague Dave Barry to contribute to A Quiet Genius: Remembering Jeff MacNelly.  Books  Morin is the author of several books: Line of Fire: Political Cartoons by Jim Morin, Bushed, and Ambushed. (The latter two cartoon collections contained words by Walter C. Clements.)

Its heyday was in the first two decades of the 20th century, with a peak population of about 400 in 1907. By 1910 the population had fallen to 138.Farm Journal Complete World Atlas, 1912 Edition, p. 195 The city was fairly prosperous for a time, and even had its own newspaper, the Tanana Miner, which later was purchased by the Fairbanks Daily News (now the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner), running concurrently with it for a time. Other businesses included two hotels, two general stores, a bakery, a laundry, and two restaurants. By 1910, Chena had a police department, a public school, churches, and a fire department. By 1915, however, the population had dropped to 50. With the death of the city's last business owner, grocer Harry Beldon, in 1920, the population had dropped to only 18. The town gradually faded away, resurging in modern times as a suburb of Fairbanks. The Tanana Valley Railroad had its southern terminus in Chena, but moved its general manager's office to Fairbanks in 1915. There was a pump station to provide water for the hydraulic mining operations on the other side of Chena Ridge, near Ester. The Chena Pump House is now a restaurant and tourist attraction. Alaska Gold Rush Chena was established and incorporated in 1903, soon after Felix Pedro found gold in Fairbanks in 1902. It was a shipping and mining town on the banks of the Tanana River. Larger ships (probably from the tidewater ports on the Yukon River) transferred cargo to smaller boats at Chena. The smaller boats would then shuttle the cargo to Fairbanks, where the Fairbanks Gold Rush was happening. In 1905, the Tanana Mines Railway (TMR) opened. It took supplies to the gold mines 20 miles away. The Tanana Mines Railway was refinanced and expanded in 1907 to become the Tanana Valley Railroad (TVRR). The railroad transported supplies to Fairbanks and other mining towns. It made Chena a successful railroad town. Competition with Fairbanks Chena competed with Fairbanks for serving the nearby gold mines. Each town wanted to supply the mines because they would make a lot of money. The Tanana Valley Railroad gave Chena a huge advantage over Fairbanks. It supplied mines in the Chatanika River Valley 43 miles North. The railroad allowed Chena to supply mines that Fairbanks couldn‚Äôt realistically serve. Chena thrived as a railroad town. It built a sawmill, power plant, and major dock facilities with warehouses, repair shops, and businesses for the seasonal freight brought by riverboats. A telegraph station was built for the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS), and connected the continental United States North to Eagle and Nome, Alaska. At its peak, the town had a hospital, school, city hall, dance hall, and 3 newspapers. One of the newspapers, The Tanana Miner, later became the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. Chena relied so much on supplying mines and miners that it couldn‚Äôt last. The amount of gold in the Tanana Valley declined quickly, so miners left to make money elsewhere. World War I started in 1914, and many miners were sent to fight. This trend continued until there were hardly any people left in Chena. The Tanana Valley Railroad went bankrupt in 1917, and was bought by what is now the Alaska Railroad. The bankruptcy of the Tanana Valley Railroad marks the collapse of the town, but the Chena townsite wasn‚Äôt officially cancelled until July 14, 1921. Fairbanks survived the downturn that came when World War I broke out. In 1903, Judge James Wickersham transferred the Third Judicial District offices to Fairbanks. Additionally, he had the town linked to the new telegraph line from Tanacross to St. Michael. Judge Wickersham also encouraged E. T. Barnette to name the town after the running vice president, Charles Fairbanks. He believed that by doing so, the town would find favor with the vice president in the future. Fairbanks continued to grow and expand into a city during this time, while Chena was solely a mining town. These actions gave Fairbanks an advantage over Chena, and Chena collapsed in 1917 while Fairbanks only faced a setback. Chena would not formally be disincorporated as a city until 1973, although it had long since been abandoned. Ghost town Chena is now a ghost town. For a long time, no one even knew where it was. There are maps of the town from when it was successful, and a Sanborn Fire Insurance map of the commercial buildings. However, there are no surveys that give scale or specific locations. None of the original railroad tracks remain. The buildings were all either destroyed by the Tanana River or repurposed in Fairbanks. Looking at where the town should be, there is no evidence that the town even existed. Fairbanks North Star Borough surveyor Martin Gutoski was disappointed that there was no clear map of the town, or its location. Chena was never properly surveyed because it had such a short boom-and-bust phase. He did some research, and found what is likely the site of the town. The town is now buried under a century‚Äôs worth of silt and dirt, but there is significant evidence that much of it still remains. Demographics Chena first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as an incorporated city.https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41033927n358-359ch10.pdf It appeared once more in 1920,https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41084484v1ch5.pdf the last time it was returned separately. As of 2010, it now lays within the Chena Ridge CDP (census-designated place).https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-1-3.pdf It is estimated that there were about 2,400 people living in Chena at its peak, around 1907-1908. Because the census data was taken in 1910, it did not reflect the population during that boom.  References  * Like a Tree to the Soil: A history of farming in Alaska's Tanana Valley, 1903 to 1940.

The school offers the International Baccalaureate at all three levels: the Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme and, at the high school level, offers the IB Diploma Programme.Glenlyon Norfolk School, International Baccalaureate, accessed May 14, 2007. Of the 2,124 schools that participate in the IB program in North America and the Caribbean, Glenlyon Norfolk School is one of only 25 schools to offer the program at all three levels.IB World School statistics: Number of schools by programme combination and region, International Baccalaureate, accessed May 19, 2012. GNS is a member of the International Baccalaureate Organization, Round Square, the Canadian Accredited Independent Schools (CAIS), Independent Schools Association of British Columbia (ISABC), and National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS). The current Head of School is Mr. Chad Holtum. GNS was ranked by the Fraser Institute in 2017/2018 as #9 out of 251 British Columbia Secondary Schools. History In 1913, a pair of enterprising British women founded Norfolk House School, an all-girls school on what is now the Pemberton Woods Campus. Miss Atkins and Miss McDermott were dedicated to a rigorous education in academics, arts, and values. 20 years later, Glenlyon Preparatory School for boys was established on the Beach Campus location by Major Ian Simpson. In 1986, the schools joined together. In 2013, GNS celebrated its 100-year anniversary since the founding of Norfolk House. GNS's nearly 700 students occupy two campuses: the Beach Drive Campus, and the Pemberton Woods Campus. The Beach Drive Campus is located near Willows Beach in Oak Bay and is home to students in Junior Kindergarten through to Grade Five. The campus is focused around the former home of Sir Francis Rattenbury. Until 2003, the Beach Drive Campus was known as the Junior Boys Campus, reserved for boys from Kindergarten to Grade 7, while girls in grades Kindergarten to Grade 12 attended classes on the Pemberton Woods Campus. In 2003 the school restructured its approach to co-ed learning, and for the first time, female students were allowed on the Beach Drive Campus. The Beach Drive Campus became a primary campus with Grades K to 5 in single-gender classes sharing a co-educational environment. The Pemberton Woods Campus became a Grades 6 to 12 campus with Grades 6 to 12 in co-ed classes. In 2012, the school became fully co-educational from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12. The Pemberton Woods Campus, home to students Grades 6 through to 12, combines the old Norfolk House Campus with a number of new buildings built after the amalgamation. Each Campus has its own Principal (Ms. Jean Bigelow in the Junior School, Mr. Damon Henry in the Middle School and Mr. Doug Palm in the Senior School), while the entire school is administered by the Head of School, Mr. Chad Holtum. In 1996, the school was accepted as an International Baccalaureate World School and began offering the IB Diploma to students in Grades 11 and 12. This was followed by authorization to offer the IB Middle Years Programme in 2004 and the IB Primary Years Programme in 2007, making GNS one of a few schools in Canada to offer the full IB continuum. As one of only 5% of IB schools in Canada authorized to offer the full continuum of IB programmes, GNS is proud of its unique 'IB Advantage': a 21st-Century approach which educates the whole child and creates global thinkers. GNS offers 5- and 7-day Family Boarding options for students who are not residents of Victoria. In June 2007, the Board of Directors approved a plan for comprehensive campus transformation. In 2009, an artificial turf field was installed. In the spring of 2013 Denford Hall, seating over 350, was completed. A further campaign was launched in 2018 to refurbish the school's two campuses, at Beach Drive and Pemberton Woods, which was supported by a $5 million donation by Gordon Denford.Jeff Bell, Victoria developer gives $5M to Glenlyon Norfolk School at timescolonist.com, dated 5 December 2018, accessed 10 May 2019 On Friday, May 24, 2019, the school celebrated the official opening of the school's new Junior Kindergarten and Kindergarten facilities and the re-dedication of the Boathouse, one of the buildings originally designed by Francis Rattenbury.

A demand management approach to transport also has the potential to deliver better environmental outcomes, improved public health, stronger communities, and more prosperous cities. TDM techniques link with and support community movements for sustainable transport. The Association for Commuter Transportation defines TDM as the use of strategies to inform and encourage travelers to maximize the efficiency of a transportation system leading to improved mobility, reduced congestion, and lower vehicle emissions. Background Traffic congestion on Interstate 5, at Los Angeles, California The term \\"TDM\\" has its origins in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, and is linked to the economic impacts of the sharp increase in oil prices during the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis. When long lines appeared at gas stations, it became self-evident that alternatives to single-occupancy commuter travel needed to be provided in order to save energy, improve air quality, and reduce peak period congestion.http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/aboutus/one_pagers/demand_mgmt.htm Travel Demand Management Challenges The concepts of TDM borrowed from mainstream transport planning in Europe, which had never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility. For example, the Dutch Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity be met only \\"if the contribution to societal welfare is positive\\" and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic. Some cities outside Europe have also consistently taken a demand management approach to transport and land use planning, notably Curitiba, Brazil; Portland, Oregon, US; Arlington, Virginia, US;Mobility Lab, Arlington, Virginia http://mobilitylab.org and Vancouver, Canada. Relatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to significant increases in vehicle travel, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as urban sprawl. Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for just in time deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic. Because vehicle travel was increasing rapidly from 1980 to 2000, it follows that (with a few exceptions) the techniques of demand management were not widely or successfully applied during this period. Small-scale projects to provide alternatives to single occupant commuter travel were common, but generally were led from outside the mainstream of transport planning. However many of the techniques in the demand management toolbox were developed during this period. The British Government's White Paper on Transport marked a change in direction. In the introduction to the White Paper, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that > We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we > face. It would be environmentally irresponsible - and would not work. A companion document to the White Paper called \\"Smarter Choices\\" researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain, and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20%. A similar study[ similar study] by the United States Federal Highway Administration, was also released in 2004 and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy. Terminology Since 2010 transportation professionals have suggested that the TDM is widely misunderstood simply as a collection of vaguely related initiatives, and that this misunderstanding is constraining the true potential of the concept. TDM practitioners have found that TDM is far more effective when framed as a philosophical approach which over time becomes a cornerstone of sustainable urban transport systems. A new paradigm in transport planning, internationally recognised as TDM, appears to be emerging which embraces concepts such as \\"mobility management\\" and \\"active travel management\\" under its umbrella. Crucial to the delivery of a sustainable urban transport system is integrating the TDM philosophy into urban transport planning, as well as the daily management and operation of transport services and infrastructure. It appears that managing travel demand has largely been compartmentalized as a set of ‚Äúsoft measures‚Äù to promote sustainable travel options or programs to promote and offer shared ride arrangements. Demand management means different things to different disciplines. For example: to Information Technology (IT) specialists, managing demand is new technology to provide information; to operations managers, managing demand is controlling the flow onto highways; to economists, it is pricing the system to find equilibrium with capacity; to marketers, it is promoting innovative campaigns; and to many policymakers TDM remains a largely unknown entity. The concept has become confused as each discipline has tried to mold the concept to their set of tools. This ‚Äúsilo‚Äù thinking inhibits the kind of policy integration that is needed to develop a sustainable urban transport solution strategy. There remains much confusion as to what a sustainable transport system would comprise. It is helpful therefore to consider different approaches to sustainable transport along a spectrum of viewpoints, ranging from weak to strong sustainability.Black, C.S. (1997) Behavioural Dimensions of the Transport Sustainability Problem, PhD Thesis, University of Portsmouth, UK. Generally efforts to address the impact of transport on climate change to date have been largely focused on technology. The impact of this technological-led approach has been very limited in the transport sector. TDM has the potential to move the transport sector from a position of weak to strong sustainability by combining behavior-change with technology improvements. In this context transport demand management is understood as a much broader concept. Implicit in the use of the term is the assumption that it is accompanied by the implementation of sustainable mobility, introduction of full cost pricing and organizational or structural measures to ensure a broad range of complementary interventions work effectively together to realize the benefits of sustainable transport. It is the unifying philosophy of TDM, not specific measures associated with it, that underpin the policy objective of a more sustainable system of transport. This philosophy of managing demand accepts that meeting unfettered demand for travel is impractical and that therefore the system needs to be managed. That demand for travel needs to be managed by: * Expanding the supply and availability of (more sustainable) alternatives; * Controlling demand for the use unsustainable modes; * Providing incentives and rewards for undertaking sustainable travel habits; and * Imposing full-cost pricing on the use of the automobile. Arguments in favor thumb The need to manage travel demand has now become urgent for a number of converging reasons. Oil prices have now passed the previous peak in 1980, and 95% of all energy used in transport is oil. Vehicle travel in the United States, which has been rising steadily since records began, started to level out before the fuel price increases and is now in decline. Part of this decline is likely to be people making fewer trips, with potentially far-reaching economic and social consequences. Countries and cities where the car is one of many travel choices are more likely to prosper, as people can choose to drive less but are still able to travel by transit, cycle safely, walk to local shops and facilities, or choose to work or study from home. Transport systems are responsible for 23% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, and are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector. Demand management is central to the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from urban transportation, Travel Demand Management (TDM) Initiative Increases in vehicle travel are linked to a range of health problems including poor urban air quality, road injuries and fatalities, and reduced physical activity. The World Health Organization stated in 2003:Charter on Transport, Environment and Health > We are concerned that current patterns of transport, which are dominated by > motorised road transport, have substantial adverse impacts on health. The efficacy of expanded roadways in managing traffic congestion is increasingly under challenge. Much of the traffic on new or expanded roads has been shown to be induced. A growing sustainable transport movement is mobilising public demand for investment in safer, more livable cities with a greater range of travel choices. Demand management toolbox There is a broad range of TDM measures, including: * Transportation management associations: leverage public and private funds to increase the use of ridesharing and other commuting options that reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality * Including or improving pedestrian-oriented design elements, such as short pedestrian crossings, wide sidewalks and street trees. * Requiring users of parking to pay the costs directly, as opposed to sharing the costs indirectly with others through increased rents and tax subsidies. * Including and improving public transportation infrastructure, such as subway entrances, bus stops and routes. * Subsidizing transit costs for employees or residents. * Bicycle-friendly facilities and environments, including secure bike storage areas and showers. See Bicycle transportation engineering * Providing active transportation (AT) facilities including bike lanes and multi-use trails. * Providing traveler information tools, including intelligent transportation system improvements, mobile and social applications, wayfinding tools, and other methods for promoting alternatives to single occupancy vehicle (SOV) modes * Flex-time work schedules with employers to reduce congestion at peak times * Active traffic management * Congestion pricing during peak hours. * Road space rationing or alternate-day travel by restricting travel based on license plate number, at certain times and places. * Workplace travel plans * Roadspace reallocation, aiming to re- balance provision between private cars which often predominate due to high spatial allocations for roadside parking, and for sustainable modes. * Time, distance and place (TDP) road pricing, where road users are charged based on when, where and how much they drive. Some transportation experts believe TDP pricing is an integral part of the next generation in transportation demand management.Next Generation Travel Demand Management: Time-Distance-Place Motor Vehicle Use Charges See also * Automobile dependency * Bus lane * Change management * Congestion pricing * Critical Mass, gatherings of cyclists, making bicycles visible * Environmental impact of aviation * Flextime * Fuel economy-maximizing behaviors * Gas-guzzler * GNSS road pricing * Stefan G√∂ssling, sustainable travel expert * Hierarchy of roads * High-occupancy vehicle lane * Hypermobility * James Howard Kunstler * List of car-free places * Park and ride * Parking * Pedestrian zone * Shared space * Street hierarchy * Telecommuting * Toll road * Traffic calming * Urban planning * Urban sprawl * Woonerf References External links * TDM defined by the Mobility Lab of Arlington County Dept. of Transportation * Techniques used by the Arlington County Dept. of Transportation Category:Transportation planning Category:Sustainable transport ","title":"Transportation demand management"},{"id":"3618214","text":"The Baltimore Streetcar Museum (BSM) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit museum.\\"Baltimore Streetcar Museum Inc.\\" Tax Exempt Organization Search.

The original Museum collection consisted of equipment used by the former United Railways and Electric Company and Baltimore Transit Company (BTCO) services, which was held for a short time, the Maryland Historical Society after Baltimore ceased streetcar service. The collection was moved from Robert E. Lee Park near Lake Roland in 1968 to the present Falls Road Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad site and public operations began in July 1970. Before public operations could commence, many hours of volunteer work were necessary to build operating track and install overhead wire which, at first, provided only a short ride for visitors. Over the years, the Museum has incrementally extended its line along Falls Road that includes now turning loops at the north and south ends of its line. Completion of the Museum's entire streetcar line was realized in October 2008 with the completion of its double tracking project, which took many years to complete. The track gauge continues to be the unique one used by original Baltimore streetcar lines.\\"Baltimore Streetcar Museum\\". Branford Electric Railroad Association. Retrieved May 20, 2019.

The term is used in both counties. Origin The deposition of the killas strata occurred during the Devonian and Carboniferous geological periods. The sediments are not evenly spread over the county, with the Carboniferous beds only found in the far north of Cornwall. The depositional environments of the killas were very varied, as is revealed by the fossil content and the sedimentary sequences. The fossils indicate changes from anaerobic, deep ocean-basin environments to shallow sea environments. The deformed brachiopod fossil Cyrtospirifer verneuili, known to quarrymen as the Delabole Butterfly, was found in the upper Devonian beds of North Cornwall. chevron folds in the cliffs at Millook Shortly after the deposition of the sediments, the Variscan orogeny caused the intrusion of the Cornubian batholith and the subsequent contact metamorphism created the metamorphic rocks seen today. This also put intense pressure on the sediments causing them to be folded and faulted. This is most apparent in the cliffs at Millook Haven on the north Cornwall coast, where the cliffs display an impressive series of angular recumbent folds. Economic uses Killas underlies two thirds of Cornwall and on and around Dartmoor in Devon, and as a result of hydrothermal mineralization from the granites, contain the majority of the mineral lodes or veins which at one time provided up to half of the world's tin and copper, and economic prosperity to Cornwall (and to a lesser extent Devon). Of lesser economic importance, the stone itself is an important building and roofing stone in Cornwall, the largest single source in the county being Delabole slate quarry, which has provided a high quality stone for at least six centuries.

It participated in the Antietam and Gettysburg Campaigns, as well as the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864 under Confederate Major General Jubal Early. The Fluvanna Artillery began as two separate batteries raised in 1861. With the outbreak of hostilities following the Battle of Fort Sumter, Governor John Letcher ordered that units be raised from around Virginia and sent to Richmond in order to defend the commonwealth. Fluvanna County was quick to respond to the governor's calls and organized an artillery battery, the \\"Sons of Fluvanna,\\" also known as the 1st Fluvanna Battery, on May 20, 1861, under the command of Capt. Charles Huckstep. With no guns or horses due to local shortages, the battery trained locally until it was ordered to report to Richmond on June 18. It boarded boats on the James River and Kanawha Canal for the trip to Richmond, whereupon arrival, the men were sent to Richmond College for more training and drill. There, the battery finally received its cannons, equipage, and horses. The 2nd Fluvanna Artillery was organized in June 1861, by Cary Cocke, the former colonel of the 12th Virginia Militia. The battery was raised in the southeastern portion of the county and used the grounds around the Fluvanna Baptist Church to drill, while the local ladies made the uniforms at the church. They were enlisted for service on August 6, 1861, at the church, and left to be equipped in Richmond. On September 3, cheered by local women as they departed, the Sons of Fluvanna (designated as the 1st Fluvanna Artillery) moved from Richmond to join the main Confederate Army stationed at Manassas. Both the 1st and 2nd Fluvanna Artillery were assigned to the same battalion, and served in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, but were held in reserve at the Second Battle of Manassas and at Sharpsburg. The battery lost a gun and a caisson at the Battle of Shepherdstown covering Robert E. Lee's retreat. In October, the two batteries were consolidated to create the Fluvanna Artillery. The Battery was held in reserves from Fredericksburg to Gettysburg and saw some action in the fall of 1863. The battery saw considerable action during the 1864 Overland Campaign under Capt. John L. Massie, serving from the Wilderness to Cold Harbor. Transferred as part of Jubal Early's command to the Army of the Valley, the battery participated in Early's raid on Washington, fighting in numerous engagements, including Monocacy and Cedar Creek. Captain Massie was mortally wounded in September 1864, and Capt. Charles G. Snead led the remaining artillerymen for the balance of the war. The battery was then temporarily disbanded around Christmas, 1864, to conserve supplies. Those who stayed behind were captured at the Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia on March 2, 1865. After capture, they were marched to Stephensons Depot. They were then loaded onto box cars and shipped north to Baltimore, Maryland. Their final destination was Fort Delaware Prison. Members were paroled and released between June 21 and 22, 1865. The Battery still continued service till the end of the war. Many were at home at the time of the battle at Waynesboro, and some may have participated in the skirmish between the Fluvanna Home Guard and Federal cavalry at Palmyra on March 10, 1865. On April 5, Captain Snead received orders to report to report to the Army of Northern Virginia, and the remainder of the Fluvanna Artillery marched out to join them. But before they could join the army, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House. The battery returned home and many received paroles at Columbia, Virginia, in May, 1865.

These four approaches can easily be combined, allowing for the creation of glass that is at the same time toughened, laminated, and contains a wire mesh. However, combination of a wire mesh with other techniques is unusual, as it typically betrays their individual qualities.  Toughened glass  Broken tempered glass showing the shape of the granular chunks Toughened glass is processed by controlled thermal or chemical treatments to increase its strength compared with normal glass. Tempering, by design, creates balanced internal stresses which causes the glass sheet, when broken, to crumble into small granular chunks of similar size and shape instead of splintering into random, jagged shards. The granular chunks are less likely to cause injury. As a result of its safety and strength, tempered glass is used in a variety of demanding applications, including passenger vehicle windows, shower doors, architectural glass doors and tables, refrigerator trays, as a component of bulletproof glass, for diving masks, and various types of plates and cookware. In the United States, since 1977 Federal law has required safety glass located within doors and tub and shower enclosures.  Laminated glass  Broken laminated safety glass, with the interlayer exposed at the top of the picture Laminated glass is composed layers of glass and plastic held together by an interlayer. When laminated glass is broken, it is held in place by an interlayer, typically of polyvinyl butyral (PVB), between its two or more layers of glass, which crumble into small pieces. The interlayer keeps the layers of glass bonded even when broken, and its toughening prevents the glass from breaking up into large sharp pieces. This produces a characteristic \\"spider web\\" cracking pattern (radial and concentric cracks) when the impact is not enough to completely pierce the glass. Laminated glass is normally used when there is a possibility of human impact or where the glass could fall if shattered. Skylight glazing and automobile windshields typically use laminated glass. In geographical areas requiring hurricane-resistant construction, laminated glass is often used in exterior storefronts, curtain walls and windows. The PVB interlayer also gives the glass a much higher sound insulation rating, due to the damping effect, and also blocks most of the incoming UV radiation (88% in window glass and 97.4% in windscreen glass).  Wire mesh glass  Wire mesh glass (also known as Georgian Wired Glass) has a grid or mesh of thin metal wire embedded within the glass. Wire-mesh-reinforced glass in the Lloyd's Building Wired glass is used in the US for its fire-resistant abilities, and is well-rated to withstand both heat and hose streams. This is why wired glass exclusively is used on service elevators to prevent fire ingress to the shaft, and also why it is commonly found in institutional settings which are often well-protected and partitioned against fire. The wire prevents the glass from falling out of the frame even if it cracks under thermal stress, and is far more heat-resistant than a laminating material. Wired glass, as it is typically described, does not perform the function most individuals associate with it. The presence of the wire mesh appears to be a strengthening component, as it is metallic, and conjures up the idea of rebar in reinforced concrete or other such examples. Despite this belief, wired glass is actually weaker than unwired glass due to the incursions of the wire into the structure of the glass. Wired glass often may cause heightened injury in comparison to unwired glass, as the wire amplifies the irregularity of any fractures. This has led to a decline in its use institutionally, particularly in schools. In recent years, new materials have become available that offer both fire-ratings and safety ratings so the continued use of wired glass is being debated worldwide. The US International Building Code effectively banned wired glass in 2006. Canada's building codes still permit the use of wired glass but the codes are being reviewed and traditional wired glass is expected to be greatly restricted in its use. Australia has no similar review taking place.

Septic Death's music became a major influence on bands like Integrity, Von,http://www.metal-sound.net/interviews.php?read=von Citizens Arrest, Infest, Rorschach and many other bands tied to the hardcore punk and extreme metal scenes. The band played only a few shows during its active years (1981 to 1986), mostly in Boise, Idaho. The band initially never intended to perform live at all, however they eventually did. Their first show, held at a local pizza restaurant, ended early after the band was kicked out after playing only six songs. Other than that, the band mostly opened for touring groups that stopped off within the town before they left Idaho in 1985. Most of Septic Death's discography is out-of-print, and due to this there have been a large number of bootlegs released over the years, some of which have been noted for being of good quality. Since 2000, Prank Records has been working on a Septic Death discography compilation titled Chumoku, however it has yet to be released. Currently, Pushead continues his work as an artist. Drummer Paul Birnbaum would go on to play in groups such as Attitude Adjustment, Haggis, and currently plays with Septic Death guitarist Jon Taylor in Little Miss and the No-Names. Bassist Michael Matlock moved to Los Angeles and graduated at USC with a film school degree. Style and influence The band's music was known for their extreme style, which would in turn influence later hardcore sub-genres such as metalcore and powerviolence. Their style has been dubbed as \\"horror hardcore\\" by fans, such as Dwid Hellion of Integrity in the liner notes to their 2005 compilation album Silver In The Hands of Time. Common lyrical themes in the band's catalog include death, paranoia, and mental illness. They've also written a few songs concerning then-current social issues. Brian Schroeder operated Pusmort Records, which has been noted as a \\"legendary label\\" and also released the compilation album Cleanse the Bacteria, which is now seen as an important record that influenced fusion genres that combine elements of punk rock with elements of heavy metal. He has also made a name for himself within the American underground by making artwork for various bands and zines, as well as writing for Maximumrocknroll. Bands that have covered Septic Death songs include Rorschach, Extreme Noise Terror, Napalm Death, and Integrity. Discography =Studio albums= * Now That I Have The Attention, What Do I Do With It?

The author released the game later into the public domain.Arcade_Volleyball on classicdosgames.com Gameplay The game features teams of one or two players (depending on the platform) shaped like balls with legs who hit the volleyball with their heads. The game is played from a side-view perspective, and the ball can be bounced off of the walls and ceiling without penalty. Scoring is based on the original volleyball scoring rules, where only the serving team can score on each volley, and 15 points are required to win the game. The same head is permitted to hit the ball multiple times, but the team may only hit the ball three times while the ball is on their side.  Versions  =Commodore 64 version= Arcade Volleyball for Commodore 64 Arcade Volleyball was originally published as a hexadecimal type-in program for MLX in the June 1988 edition of COMPUTE!'s Gazette. The article was written by Rhett Anderson and David Hensley, Jr., who had also published a similar game called Basketball Sam & Ed in the July 1987 issue. The game featured two heads per team, controlled by a single player, which moved and jumped together. It was not necessary to win the game by 2 points; when either side reached 15 points, the game would pause and ask if the user wanted to play again. By default the game was played between two human players, but it was possible to modify the game so that one player could play against the computer by typing \\"POKE 2065,1\\" to type the number 1 into the memory address that controlled the number of players.

A portion of the railroad later became part of the Alaska Railroad.  History  The TVRR was incorporated as the Tanana Mines Railway in 1904, construction on the first section started and completed in 1905. The main speaker at the gala golden spike ceremony was Judge Wickersham and Mrs. Isabelle Barnett accepted the golden spike. The builder was Falcon Joslin who was called the \\"Harriman of the North\\". It was renamed the Tanana Valley Railroad in 1907. The company declared bankruptcy and was liquidated c. 1917. The U.S. government purchased the railroad in June 1917, and the section between Fairbanks and Happy was converted to dual gauge by the Alaskan Engineering Commission, in order to complete a railroad line from Seward to Fairbanks. This line became the Alaska Railroad (Alaska RR) in 1923. The Alaska RR continued to operate the former TVRR narrow-gauge line as the Chatanika Branch, until decommissioning it in 1930.  Preservation  In 1922, the railroad's Engine No. 1, the first steam locomotive in Fairbanks and the Yukon, was retired. Its restoration was begun in 1997 and completed in 2000. As of 2011 it is still being steamed up several times a year. A small museum for the engine was built in 2005 in Pioneer Park.

History  Agnes of Urakami, displayed at United Nations Headquarters Urakami Cathedral, 7 January 1946 Ruins of the cathedral destroyed by the atomic bomb with the rebuilt cathedral in the background Urakami Cathedral in 1964 (before the 1980 remodeling) In 1865, the French priest Bernard Petitjean discovered that almost all the Urakami villagers were Christian. Between 1869 and 1873, over 3,600 villagers were banished. During their exile, 650 died. The persecuted Kakure Kirishitan (Hidden Christians) came back to their home village after 7 years exile in 1873, and decided to construct their own church. Construction of the original Urakami Cathedral, a brick Neo-Romanesque building, began in 1895, after a long-standing ban on Christianity was lifted. They purchased the land of the village chief where the humiliating interrogations had taken place for two centuries. The annual \\"fumi-e\\" interrogations required those present to tread upon an icon of the Virgin Mary or Jesus. They thought the place was appropriate considering their memory of the long persecution. Construction of the building was started by Father Francine and was completed under the direction of Father Regani. The frontal twin spires stood 64 meters high were constructed in 1875. When completed in 1925 (Taish≈ç 14), until its destruction in 1945, it was the largest Christian structure in the Asia-Pacific region. The atomic bomb that fell on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 detonated in Urakami only 500 m (1640 ft) from the cathedral, completely destroying it. As the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (August 15) was near, Mass was held on the day and was well attended. The resultant collapse and heat-wave cindered and buried all those present in the Cathedral. The destruction of the cathedral hit the religious community of Nagasaki the hardest, as they viewed it as a loss of spirituality. It had such an impact, that noted playwright Tanaka Chikao wrote his most successful play, Head of Mary, about the efforts of Christians in Nagasaki to reconstitute their faith by rebuilding the Virgin Mary. The plans to replace the cathedral led to a prolonged debate between the city government and the congregation. The city government had suggested preserving the destroyed cathedral as a heritage site, and offered an alternate site for a new church. However, Christians in Nagasaki strongly wanted to rebuild their cathedral on the original site, as a symbol of their persecution and suffering. In January of 1958 the Catholic community announced their intent to build a new, larger cathedral of reinforced concrete on the original site and following the plan of the original cathedral. After further debate the city government accepted this proposal and the new cathedral was finished by October 1959. In 1980 the cathedral was remodeled using brick tiles to more closely resemble the original French style. Statues and artifacts damaged in the bombing, including a French Angelus bell, are now displayed on the grounds. The nearby Peace Park contains remnants of the original cathedral's walls. What remained of the cathedral is now on display in the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum.

An oral history of the Farmington Mine disaster The Consol No. 9 mine was developed in the Pittsburgh coal seam, with its main entrances at James Fork, the confluence of Little Dunkard Mill Run and Dunkard Mill Run, 2 miles (3 kilometers) north of Farmington, West Virginia (). The Pittsburgh seam is over 300 feet (90 meters) below the valley bottoms in this region, and is fairly uniform, generally about 10 feet (3 meters) thick. This mine was originally opened in 1909 as the Jamison No. 9 Mine, operated by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The original entrance shafts were 322 feet deep. Even in 1909, it was noted that \\"gasses are liberating\\" from the coal in the mine, so that locked safety lamps were used at all times. Initially, compressed air power was used to undercut the coal, which was then blasted before horse power was used to haul the coal to the shaft, but within a year, compressed air locomotives were obtained for the mine railway.Annual Report, Department of Mines for the Year Ending June 30, 1910, West Virginia Department of Mines, Charleston News Mail Co, 1911. Third Section, Page 15. Between 1911 and 1929, Jamison No. 9 produced over 100,000 tons per year, except in 1922, when production was just under 3000 tons.

At 5:30 a.m on November 20, 1968 an explosion shook the mine. It was so strong that a motel clerk reported feeling vibrations 12 miles away. Miners living in the area heard the noise and, knowing what it meant, headed to the mine, where they discovered a rapidly spreading fire with flames shooting 150 feet into the air. Within hours, 21 miners made it to the surface but 78 were still trapped underground. The fires continued to burn for over a week, and on November 29, rescuers finally admitted defeat after air samples from drill holes showed air unable to sustain human life. The mine was sealed on November 30 with concrete to starve the fire of oxygen. In September 1969, the mine was unsealed in an attempt to recover the miners' bodies. Progress was slow because workers discovered cave- ins that they had to tunnel around. This recovery effort continued for almost ten years. By April 1978, 59 of the 78 bodies had been recovered.

Resulting governmental legislation  Investigation and recovery operations following the re-opening of the mine shafts. The Farmington disaster was a catalyst for the passage of major changes in U.S. mining safety law. One month after the disaster the U.S. Department of the Interior held a conference on mine safety. Stewart Udall's opening speech specifically referenced Farmington and concluded, \\"let me assure you, the people of this country no longer will accept the disgraceful health and safety record that has characterized this major industry.\\" Lockard, Duane. Coal: A Memoir and Critique. Charlottesville, University Press of Virginia, 1998. p. 71. As a result of the Farmington disaster, the United States Congress passed the 1969 Coal Mine Safety and Health Act which strengthened safety standards, increased Federal mine inspections, and gave coal miners specific safety and health rights. In November of 1968 Davitt McAteer conducted a study of West Virginia mines after the Farmington disaster.  Investigation  In 1990, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration investigation into the accident concluded in part that the ventilation in the mine ‚Äúwas inadequate overall, and most probably non- existent in some areas.‚Äù In 2008, a memo written by an investigator in September 1970 came to light. In it, the inspector wrote that a safety alarm on a ventilation fan used to flush explosive methane gas from the mine had been disabled. ‚ÄúTherefore when the fan would stop there was no way of anyone knowing about it because the alarm signal was bypassed,‚Äù the inspector wrote.  Litigation  Families of the miners that died in the blast were never compensated for their deaths. A lawsuit filed in Marion County Circuit Court on November 6, 2014, on behalf of the estates of dead miners, alleged that plaintiffs discovered in June that the mine‚Äôs chief electrician, Alex Kovarbasich, disabled a ventilation fan that contributed to the accident. The lawsuit further alleges that the mining company, Consolidation Coal Co., has concealed the identity of the manager since the accident.https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/11/07/decades-after-deadly-w-va-mine- disaster-new-lawsuit-assigns-blame/ After being transferred to federal district court due to diversity of plaintiffs' jurisdiction, the case was initially dismissed due to the statute of limitations around wrongful death suits in West Virginia. The suit was subsequently referred to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit due to a lack of precedent.

He wrote two travel guides, Through Europe on Two Dollars a Day and Come with me to France, and, with the approaching end of Prohibition in the United States, researched and wrote a series of articles for The New Yorker.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 616 Oxford University Press 2006 While involved in this latter project he met Raymond Baudoin, the editor of the La Revue du vin de France, who took him under his wing and taught him about wine, touring the various wine regions of France. Schoonmaker also collaborated in the wine trade with Alexis Lichine, another wine writer, and the pair was considered the two most influential wine writers in the US for several decades. In January 1976, Frank Schoonmaker died at his home at 50 East 72nd Street in New York City. Army service In 1939 Schoonmaker joined a new division of the U.S. Army known as the Office of Strategic Services or O.S.S, where he was stationed in Spain. He received the Bronze Star for his work with the O.S.S. After the war, Alexis Lichine negotiated a full partnership with Schoonmaker, but the wine partnership ended bitterly. In 1946, after many months of trying to find a compromise that would work for both, Lichine went to work as the import-export manager for United Distillers of America. Wine writings and marketing Schoonmaker's importance was both as a writer, the author of the Complete Wine Book (1934) and later the classic Frank Schoonmaker's Encyclopedia of Wine, and as a wine importer, who found American markets especially for small scale growers in Burgundy such as Domaine Ponsot in Morey St Denis and the Marquis d'Angerville in Volnay. Together with Baudoin, Schoonmaker played a seminal role in creating a market for wines bottled by the grower/winemaker rather than by a negotiant' ‚Äì a merchant/shipper. He started \\"Frank Schoonmaker Selections\\" in 1936 in New York City. In 1972 The 'Frank Schoonmaker Selections' company was purchased by a division of the Souverain wine conglomerate. It was owned by Pillsbury of Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1974 the Souverain wineries and the Frank Schoonmaker Import wine business were sold to St. Helena's Freemark Abbey wine group, and was renamed Rutherford Hill Winery. The same year a group of 179 grape growers bought the Alexander Valley Souverain facility. It has since become the property of Francis Ford Coppola. The Frank Schoonmaker Selections division was liquidated in 1975. Consulting work As a consultant to such Californian wineries as Wente and Almaden, Schoonmaker introduced the idea of labeling wines using varietal names (such as Pinot noir, Chardonnay, or Riesling) rather than semi-generic names borrowed from European regions (\\"Burgundy\\", \\"Chablis\\", \\"Rhine\\", etc.). Schoonmaker claimed that \\"the more specific the name, the better the wine\\". While Schoonmaker was promoting the practice in California already around 1940, it did not become truly widespread until the late 1960s and early 1970s. Robert Mondavi was one of the first to label the majority of his wines by varietal names and was tireless in promoting the practice. This has become the standard in New World wine and some European producers are adopting the practice because of consumer demand.

Giuseppe Biancani (in Latin, Josephus Blancanus) (1566‚Äì1624) was an Italian Jesuit astronomer, mathematician, and selenographer, after whom the crater Blancanus on the Moon is named.USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature He was a native of Bologna. His Aristotelis loca mathematica ex universis ipsius operibus collecta et explicata, published in Bologna, appeared in 1615, in which Biancani discussed Aristotelian thought on floating bodies. The work suffered censorship whilst undergoing peer review, a common Jesuit practice. The reviewer, Giovanni Camerota, wrote: \\"It does not seem to be either proper or useful for the books of our members to contain the ideas of Galileo Galilei, especially when they are contrary to Aristotle.\\" Biancani wrote his Sphaera mundi, seu cosmographia demonstrativa, ac facili methodo tradita in 1615. However, it was not published until 1619 in Bologna, after the Decree of the Congregation of the Index in 1616. In his Sphaera mundi, Biancani expounded on his belief that God had made the Earth a perfect symmetrical world: the highest mountain on land had its proportional equivalent in the lowest depth of the ocean. The original Earth emerged on the third day of the creation myth as a perfectly smooth sphere, Biancani reasoned. If not for the hand of God, \\"natural law\\" would have allowed the Earth to remain in that form. Biancani believed, however, that God had created the depths of the sea and formed the mountains of the Earth. Moreover, if left to \\"natural law,\\" the Earth would be consumed in water, in imitation of how it was created. However, the hand of God would intervene in order to cause the Earth to be destroyed entirely by fire. The contents of the book are described in Latin as: Sphaera Mundi seu Cosmographia. Demonstrativa, ac facili Methodo tradita: In qua totius Mundi fabrica, una cum novis, Tychonis, Kepleri, Galilaei, aliorumque; Astronomorum adinventis continetur. Accessere I. Brevis introductio ad Geographiam. II. Apparatus ad Mathematicarum studium. III. Echometria, idest Geometrica tractatio de Echo. IV. Novum. As evidenced in the table of contents, this work also presented a summary of the discoveries made with the telescope by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Copernicus, and others. The censorship of Biancani's previous work affected the manner in which he wrote Sphaera mundi. \\"But that this opinion [heliocentrism] is false,\\" Biancani wrote, during his discussion on Copernican and Keplerian theories, \\"and should be rejected (even though it is established by better proofs and arguments) has nevertheless become much more certain in our day when it has been condemned by the authority of the Church as contrary to Sacred Scripture\\" (Sphaera, IV, 37). The work not only included studies on the natural phenomenon of the echo and on sundials, but also included a diagram of the Moon. Giuseppe Biancani's map was not drawn up in support of new Copernican ideas but those berthed in traditional geocentric cosmology and in support of Aristotelian thought. Biancani disagreed with Galileo, who believed in the existence of lunar mountains. In a 1611 letter to Christoph Grienberger (after whom the Gruemberger crater is named), Biancani wrote of his certainty that there could not be any mountains on the Moon. Biancani opined that the Copernican system was of opinionem falsam... ac rejeciendam. Nevertheless, Biancani remained ambivalent in the midst of the Scientific Revolution, as he cited Galileo's opinions on the surface of the Moon while also discussing those of the ancients, such as Posidonius and Cleomedes. Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying illustrations. Bernhardus Varenius based much of his geographical work on Biancani's ideas.

The RR is a counter-insurgency force made up of soldiers deputed from other parts of the Indian Army. The force is currently deployed in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Since the RR are under the authority of Ministry of Defence, and furthermore were initially designated \\"paramilitary\\" to get around an army manpower ceiling, they are sometimes misidentified as part of the Paramilitary forces of India. In actuality however, they are a force completely composed of Indian Army personnel, who undergo pre-induction training and operate in a grid structure to deal with insurgents at high altitudes. History =Initial Doctrine= The last decade of the 20th century was particularly bloody for Kashmir. By May 1990 it was clear that the Kashmir Valley was in the grip of jihadist insurgency of an intensity not seen before. It started out in the urban areas and then spread to the countryside. The army, which till then was guarding the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the state, was called in to assist in counter insurgency (CI) operations. Based on its experience with low intensity conflicts in Nagaland, Sri Lanka and Punjab, the Indian Army was quite wary of trying to replicate strategy and tactics successfully used elsewhere. In Nagaland for example, the army had learnt that physical domination of each and every village was one way to combat insurgency. Long experience had taught the army the value of the grid system. In this system all terrain in the affected area was divided into a grid. Each node at any given time would have a platoon worth of ready-to-move soldiers, the so-called quick reaction team, which would mutually reinforce other nodes. All would be covered with heavier fire support and have adequate logistics. However the grid often looked better on paper than on the ground. The obvious reason for this was the terrain. In the Wanni jungles of Sri Lanka where the grid had been successfully applied, civilians and villages were few and far between, enabling heavy firepower like attack helicopters and artillery to be brought in to support troops in the grid in minutes. However, the Kashmir Valley is very densely populated and there is a risk of significant collateral damage from using heavy fire support. Therefore, troops on CI operations had to do without heavy weapons and to make up for that, the grid had to be more densely packed. This is where the army saw the need for additional forces in the form of the Rashtriya Rifles (RR). =Raising= The army got the go-ahead to create the RR from the Vishwanath Pratap Singh government in 1990. The initial sanction was for two sectors headquarters (HQs) each of three battalions. When General B.C. Joshi became Chief of Army Staff, the promise his predecessor, General Sunith Francis Rodrigues, made about making the Pathankot-based 39th Infantry Division and the Bareilly-based 6th Mountain Division available for Kashmir was pending. Joshi pushed a long-held army view, that India was involved in an extended counter-insurgency akin to the Naga problem in the northeast. Hence a new force, like the Assam Rifles, was needed which could be permanently located in the area to counter the insurgents. He was of the opinion that using the army divisions for CI would be playing into Pakistani hands. He instead pushed for setting up 10 more RR sector HQs consisting of 30 battalions, or the equivalent of three divisions. It was also felt that in the bargain the army would have three additional battle-hardened divisions, ready for rear guard action during war. In 1994, the P.V. Narasimha Rao government gave a conditional go-ahead for a period of three years. By 1994 the RR had 5,000 troops, all of whom served in Jammu and Kashmir. After the government gave the go-ahead to set up the RR, the army decided to milk its existing units by 10‚Äì20% of their personnel to set it up quickly. The officers and men came on deputation from all branches of the army including the Infantry, Army Service Corps, Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Artillery and Armoured Corps. The infantry provided 50% of the troops, services provided 10% and other arms provided 40%. In fact the army mothballed a few armoured regiments and transferred their manpower to the RR. In raising the RR to full strength, the army also had to dig into its war-wastage reserves, with the best available vehicles, weapons and radio sets going to the RR. In fact, RR units were the first to receive bulletproof jackets and specially designed Indian Army CI helmets known as patkas. With manpower drawn from all its arms and services, the army had to deal with serious shortages in many of its conventional units, as RR battalions are maintained at full authorised strength. However once the teething problems were overcome the RR proved it was worth the trouble. =Composition= The initial RR units performed well despite certain inherent weaknesses in their class and composition. They were raised on all India/all class basis with troops from all over the army, the logic being that since the units were going to fight an insurgency, there should be no scope for vested interests in accusing a battalion of bias based on class or regional attributes. Unfortunately, this setup created problems in the field. The initial RR units were like transit camps, with troops coming and going at regular intervals. There was little camaraderie and cohesion among troops. There were also numerous problems of administration and even of indiscipline. COs of infantry battalions who were asked to provide manpower generally used to use that as a chance to get rid of troublemakers. If the initial battalions performed well in hostile conditions, it was mainly due to the professional competence of NCOs and officers who were tasked to lead them. Keeping this in mind, a decision was taken to alter the basic composition of the RR battalions. Instead of its units being composed of troops from all over the army, at least two RR battalions were made an integral part of each of the infantry regiments and other arms. The majority of troops in those RR battalions, along with the battalion's commanding officer, are from the same regiment. This ensures not only functional cohesion but also maintenance of regimental esprit de corps. Each regimental center was given the task of raising 1‚Äì2 battalions in one years' time. During this period, the units were raised and sent to Northern Command where they got another 4 to 6 weeks to consolidate. All of them went through a structured 8-week course in special CI schools. They were then given another month to stabilise and were then sent to the more dormant sectors of Kashmir and to the Punjab. To provide some experience base, 6 RR battalions were exchanged for 6 Assam Rifles units. The entire experiment of drawing RR battalions from individual regiments produced excellent results, even while the units were deployed in the most difficult areas. =Effectiveness= The initial RR battalions deployed in the terrorist-infested areas of Tarn Taran in Punjab and Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir proved to be extremely effective. In Punjab, the deployment of the army and RR units contributed significantly to the turnaround in the situation. Since then the RR has been increasingly fighting the low-intensity war on behalf of the army in Kashmir. Casualty figures indicate that from 3 out of 44 army casualties in 1991 being from the RR, the figure had gone up to 82 out of 150 in 1996. Up to February 1997, 17 RR officers (including 1 Colonel, 4 Lt. Colonels and 7 Majors), 13 JCOs and 169 other ranks had been killed in action. The officer to other ranks casualty ratio for the RR (at 1:9.94 till February 1997) was almost double the average for the army in the Kargil War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (at 1:20). By the time the RR celebrated its 8th anniversary it had become the most decorated organisation in the army, as it had earned more that 500 gallantry awards. In fact, 25% of the units had already been awarded the unit citation by the Chief of Army Staff for their distinguished performances. By September 1997, due to the combined efforts of the army, RR, and other paramilitary forces, the situation in Kashmir had stabilised to the extent that the army decided to de-induct 13 battalions (12,000 troops) including two brigades from the Kashmir valley over a two-year period. In fact up to Spring 1999, the army had already withdrawn nine battalions (8,000 troops) including a brigade from the Kashmir valley without replacements. The last batch of 4 battalions (about 4,000 troops) along with a brigade HQ commenced de-inducting in April 1999 and was supposed to complete by mid-summer 1999. Despite all this the army was still contributing about 58 battalions to the CI ops ‚Äì 36 in the Kashmir Valley and 22 in the Jammu region. =Funding= Another change that was made was to have the Union Home Ministry (MHA) ‚Äì instead of the Ministry of Defence ‚Äì take over the burden of funding the RR. Although this was a good step, in reality it existed on paper. In 1997, the MHA owed the army Rs. 9.50 billion for the RR. The budgetary outlay for the force was Rs. 2.63 billion in 1998‚Äì99. This was upped to Rs. 3.75 billion in the revised estimates for that year and the outlay for 1999‚Äì2000 was Rs. 5.87 billion. Clearly if the funding were to come from the correct source in time, the army could use it for its modernisation programmes. =Crest= The RR crest consists of the Ashoka Chakra and two crossed rifles with fixed bayonets. Beneath, in a banner, is emblazoned the RR's motto: \\"Dridhta aur virta\\". Organisation All units of the Indian Army have an organisational structure called the War Establishment (WE). The WE is used to lay down the number of men, vehicles, weapons etc. which a unit is authorised to use for carrying out its assigned role. The infantry battalions in the Indian Army have a standard organisation called the Inf Bn Standard. Other types of infantry battalions are called by various modifications to the Inf Bn Standard according to their assigned role, like Inf Bn CI, Inf Bn Mountains, Parachute Inf Bn, Para Commando Bn and even (till 1975) Camel Mounted Bn. Till the RR came into the picture, the infantry battalions tasked for CI ops were on the Inf Bn CI. A battalion on Inf Bn CI had four infantry companies and retained their battalion heavy weapons since they were dual tasked. The RR on the other hand has an organisation structure tailor-made for CI operations. Each RR battalion has six infantry companies and does not have the heavy battalion weapons which the Inf Bn CI carry, although RR troops do train on them. The heavy weapons are left back at bases as they are considered useless in CI operations. Thus RR battalions do not incur the costs of a heavier unit. Also unlike regular army units which were rotated out of the valley regularly, the RR concept was to rotate personnel after fixed periods of deputation. Currently this is 2-3 years. RR personnel receive 25% more salary than regular army personnel and additional benefits, thus often making it a coveted deputation. The RR units are permanently located in \\"sectors\\", with each sector being the equivalent of a brigade with three battalions. To create a distinct identity, the RR has its own dress, special insignia and flag logistics. The RR units come under four \\"Counter Insurgency Force\\" (CIF) HQs. Each CIF is responsible for an area of the Kashmir Valley and Jammu Division. There were originally four CIFs, until the RR raised a fifth \\"Uniform\\" force in 2003‚Äì04: * Counter Insurgency Force (CIF) R / Romeo Force ‚Äì Rajouri and Poonch * Counter Insurgency Force (CIF) D / Delta Force ‚Äì Doda * Counter Insurgency Force (CIF) V / Victor Force ‚Äì Anantnag, Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Budgam * Counter Insurgency Force (CIF) K / Kilo Force ‚Äì Kupwara, Baramulla and Srinagar * Counter Insurgency Force (CIF) U / Uniform Force ‚Äì Udhampur and Banihal Victor Force and Kilo Force come under the operational control of 15 Corps. Delta Force and Romeo Force come under the operational control of the 16 Corps. Each force is headed by a general officer commanding (GOC) with the rank of a Major General. In terms of their location and use, each of the units and sectors was seen as being interchangeable with a regular, equivalent army formation. GOC Victor Force in some instances would have 2 sector HQs and a regular infantry brigade in his charge. On the other hand, when 8 Mountain Division moved to Kashmir, it came with 2 brigades which were then augmented by adding a sector of the RR apart from a couple of independent mountain brigades to it. The areas covered by the Counter Insurgency Forces are themselves divided into sectors: * Sector 1 ‚Äì Anantnag district * Sector 2 ‚Äì Kulgam district * Sector 3 ‚Äì Manasbal Lake * Sector 4 ‚Äì Doda district * Sector 5 ‚Äì Baramulla district * Sector 6 ‚Äì Poonch district * Sector 7 ‚Äì Kupwara district * Sector 8 ‚Äì Kupwara district * Sector 9 ‚Äì Kishtwar district * Sector 10 ‚Äì Baramulla district * Sector 11 ‚Äì Banihal * Sector 12 ‚Äì Budgam district RR comprises 65 battalions.P361 The Military Balance, 2010, The International Institute for Strategic Studies Known RR battalion affiliations include: *1 RR ‚Äì Mahar Regiment *2 RR - Sikh Light Infantry *3 RR - Jammu & Kashmir Rifles *4 RR ‚Äì Bihar Regiment *5 RR - Jat Regiment *6 RR - Sikh Regiment *7 RR ‚Äì Punjab Regiment *8 RR - Madras Regiment *9 RR - Rajputana Rifles *10 RR ‚Äì Rajput Regiment *11 RR ‚Äì Dogra Regiment *12 RR ‚Äì The Grenadiers *13 RR ‚Äì Kumaon Regiment *14 RR - Garhwal Rifles *15 RR ‚Äì 1 Gorkha Rifles *16 RR - Sikh Regiment *17 RR ‚Äì Maratha Light Infantry *18 RR - Rajputana Rifles *19 RR - Sikh Light Infantry *20 RR - Dogra Regiment *21 RR ‚Äì Brigade of the Guards *22 RR ‚Äì Punjab Regiment *23 RR - Rajput Regiment *24 RR - Bihar Regiment *25 RR - Army Air Defence *26 RR - Kumaon Regiment *27 RR - Maratha Light Infantry *28 RR - Jammu & Kashmir Rifles *29 RR - The Grenadiers *30 RR - Mahar Regiment *31 RR - Parachute Regiment *32 RR ‚Äì 3 Gorkha Rifles *33 RR ‚Äì 5 Gorkha Rifles *34 RR - Jat Regiment *35 RR - Assam Regiment *36 RR ‚Äì Garhwal Rifles *37 RR - Punjab Regiment *38 RR - Madras Regiment *39 RR - The Grenadiers *40 RR- Dogra Regiment *41 RR - Maratha Light Infantry *42 RR - Assam Regiment *43 RR ‚Äì Rajputana Rifles *44 RR - Rajput Regiment *45 RR - Jat Regiment *46 RR - Sikh Regiment *47 RR - Bihar Regiment *48 RR - Garhwal Rifles *49 RR - Sikh Light Infantry *50 RR - Kumaon Regiment *51 RR - Mahar Regiment *52 RR - Jammu & Kashmir Rifles *53 RR - Punjab Regiment *54 RR - Madras Regiment *55 RR - The Grenadiers *56 RR - Maratha Light Infantry *57 RR - Rajputana Rifles *58 RR - Rajput Regiment *59 RR - Assam Regiment *60 RR - Naga Regiment *61 RR - Jat Regiment *62 RR - Dogra Regiment *63 RR -Bihar Regiment Recruitment The RR was raised as a paramilitary force and it was envisaged that its personnel, like the Assam Rifles, would consist of regular army volunteers on deputation, ex-servicemen and lateral inductees from various paramilitary forces and central police organisations. However, this didn't work out. Instead, each infantry regiment of the Indian Army has at least two RR battalions, and soldiers and officers from the regiment are deputed to the RR battalions for 2-3 years. Thus it is not possible to join the RR directly, as personnel must first join a regiment before they can serve in the RR. RR personnel receive 25% more salary than regular army personnel and additional benefits, thus often making it a coveted deputation.

History and the Festival of Congadas Festival of Congadas in Catal√£o Catal√£o began to be occupied around 1722 or 1723 when one of the bandeirantes, Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva planted crops for his supply. The settlement began around 1728, with the construction of a few huts to support the troops who were penetrating this region. Near Catal√£o, one of the chaplains of the force, Frei Ant√¥nio, a native of Catalonia and called \\"o Catal√£o\\" decided to start a rest point near a small stream. By 1828, the settlement had five houses with tile roofs and twenty grass covered huts. In 1859, Catal√£o became a legally constituted city. Today the municipality has an area of 3,789 km2,. corresponding to 1.1% of the state territory The story of the , Catal√£o's popular festival began in 1820, when semi-free slaves arrived in the Vila of Catal√£o to work in the coffee plantations. The slaves brought with them their customs, one of which was the cult of Our Lady of the Rosary. Her commemoration included a mixture of Afro and Catholic rites. Now these dances, with strong influences from the Congo and Mo√ßambique, are celebrated in Catal√£o in the largest festival of Congadas in Brazil. The festival takes place on the last Friday of September and lasts until the second Sunday of October, when the dancers go to the streets in their colorful costumes, filling the city streets with their songs, which give thanks to their patroness for the blessings given.

The film tells the story of the Andrea Gail, a commercial fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands after being caught in the Perfect Storm of 1991. The film stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, John Hawkes, William Fichtner, Michael Ironside, John C. Reilly, Diane Lane, Karen Allen and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.Berardinelli, James, The Perfect Storm Film Review ‚Äì reelviews.net, 2000 (Retrieved on 2007-01-25) It was released on June 30, 2000, by Warner Bros. and grossed $328 million worldwide.  Plot  In October 1991, the commercial fishing boat Andrea Gail returns to port in Gloucester, Massachusetts, with a poor catch. Boat owner Bob Brown (Michael Ironside) ridicules and taunts Captain Billy Tyne over his recent \\"cold streak\\". Desperate to redeem himself, Captain Tyne convinces the Andrea Gail crew to join him for one more late-season fishing expedition. The crew heads out past their usual fishing grounds on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, leaving a developing tropical storm behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the Flemish Cap, where their luck greatly improves. At the height of their fishing, the ice machine breaks down; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decides to risk the storm. However, between Andrea Gail and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane, which the Andrea Gail crew underestimates. After repeated warnings from other ships, Andrea Gail loses her antenna, forcing Captain Linda Greenlaw of sister ship Hannah Boden to call in a Mayday. A New York Air National Guard HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refueling with an HC-130 Hercules, the helicopter crew ditch their aircraft. All but one of the Air National Guard crew members are rescued by a Coast Guard vessel, the USCGC Tamaroa. After Andrea Gail endures various problems, with 40 foot waves crashing into the deck, a broken stabilizer ramming the side of the ship, and two crew members briefly getting thrown overboard, the crew struggles to sail through pounding waves and shrieking winds, while friends and family worry and wait for a ship that never comes home. The vessel encounters an enormous rogue wave. They attempt to drive the boat over the wave, but it crests before it can get to the top and is overturned. Billy elects to go down with his ship, the rest of the crew are trapped inside the living quarters, and only one, rookie fisherman Bobby Shatford, manages to get out. He surfaces and watches as Andrea Gail rights herself before sinking stern-first into the Atlantic. Knowing that he has no chance of survival without a lifejacket, Bobby silently says his goodbyes to his loved ones as the rapidly rising swell carries him away. There are no survivors; Linda reads the eulogy at the memorial. Later, as she heads out to sea again, she remembers Billy soliloquizing about what it means to be a ship captain. Cast *George Clooney as Frank William \\"Billy\\" Tyne, Jr., captain of Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat. Billy is a divorced father of two daughters, who is determined to undertake one last fishing trip before the end of the season to make up for a recent string of poor catches. *Mark Wahlberg as Robert \\"Bobby\\" Shatford, the least experienced of the crew of Andrea Gail. Bobby is the son of Ethel Shatford, the owner of the Crow's Nest, and boyfriend to Chris Cotter. He enjoys commercial fishing, but his deepening relationship with Chris (coupled with her reluctance to let him sail again) creates conflict within himself and between the couple. Yet, he is compelled by the potential to earn more money at sea than he could make with a job on shore to sign on for one last trip. *Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Linda Greenlaw, the captain of Hannah Boden. Linda and Billy both captain ships for the same owner and maintain a friendly rivalry. She is concerned about Billy and his crew's going out in what she considers dangerous weather. Linda is the last to speak to Andrea Gail. *Diane Lane as Christina \\"Chris\\" Cotter, girlfriend of Bobby Shatford. She does not want Bobby to go on the trip because of a bad feeling she has about it. She spends her time during the last fishing trip decorating an apartment she has rented as a surprise for Bobby to symbolize her commitment to him. *John C. Reilly as Dale \\"Murph\\" Murphy, senior crewmember on Andrea Gail. Murph is a veteran fisherman who is divorced with a son with whom he's very involved. Murph has a rocky relationship with crewmember David \\"Sully\\" Sullivan that is eventually resolved during the trip. *William Fichtner as David \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, crewmember on Andrea Gail. He signed on for the trip at the last minute when another fisherman suddenly backed out. Sully and Murph initially have an antagonistic relationship that is fueled in part by Sully's past involvement with Murph's ex-wife, although the details are not made clear in the film. The relationship is eventually resolved during the trip. *Michael Ironside as Bob Brown, owner of Andrea Gail and Hannah Boden. Although Brown seems to harbor a deep-seated recognition of Tyne's skills at catching fish, he nevertheless pressures Tyne over the latter's recent inability to bring in larger hauls, resulting in an uneasy relationship between the two. *Bob Gunton as Alexander McAnally III, owner of Mistral, a yacht caught in the storm. *Karen Allen as Melissa Brown, crewmember on Mistral. *Cherry Jones as Edie Bailey, crewmember on Mistral. *Allen Payne as Alfred Pierre, one of the crew of Andrea Gail. *John Hawkes as Michael \\"Bugsy\\" Moran, a member of Andrea Gail's crew. Bugsy's somewhat comic inability to connect with women appears to change on the eve of the trip, when he meets a divorced mother at the Crow's Nest, who later comes to the dock to see him off. They hint at the prospect of a budding relationship that fatefully never materializes. *Janet Wright as Ethel Shatford, Bobby's mother. * Christopher McDonald as Todd Gross, a Boston meteorologist working for the WNEV-TV (the present day WHDH-TV). *Dash Mihok as Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell, a pararescueman on the New York Air National Guard rescue helicopter.  Historical accuracy  =The Andrea Gail= Hurricane Grace on October 28, 1991, when the Andrea Gail went missing. A ship similar to Andrea Gail, Lady Grace, was used during the filming of the movie. Most of the names used were not changed for the fictional film, but in response two lawsuits were later filed by certain families of the crew members. The film only claims to be \\"based on a true story\\", and differs in many ways from the book starting with the fictionalization of the material into a \\"story\\". The events shown in the film after the Andrea Gail's last radio contact are pure speculation, as the boat and the bodies of the crew were never found. Contrary to the movie's storyline, Captain Linda Greenlaw says she did not place a distress call on behalf of Andrea Gail. \\"Without a distress call (directly) from the imperiled vessel, the Coast Guard will not initiate a search until the vessel is five days overdue in port,\\" Greenlaw said. She had also been 600 miles east of the Andrea Gail when she went down (not west as depicted), and stated \\"They never indicated they were in trouble. They just never came back.\\" The 1993 U.S. Coast Guard's investigative report said that Andrea Gail was experiencing 30-foot waves and winds from anywhere from around the time of the last communication. The conditions, though threatening, were probably not unfamiliar to Tyne, who had been a successful fisherman for about a decade on other vessels, taking trips to the Grand Banks and fishing off Florida, the Carolinas, and elsewhere. Hurricane Grace is exaggerated in the movie when it is referred to by a weather forecaster as a \\"category 5\\" storm, which has winds sustained at over 137 knots (‚â• 157 mph). In reality, the hurricane had already peaked at category 2 intensity and ocean buoy monitors recorded wind gusts at 65 knots (75 mph) around the time Andrea Gail sank. In the movie, Tyne and his crew agreed to head into the dangerous storm in order to save their fish from spoiling. Greenlaw acknowledged that Tyne did mention having ice problems, but that was not unusual. \\"My one gripe about [the] movie was how Warner Brothers depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous,\\" said Greenlaw. \\"That is not what happened. Andrea Gail was three days into their steam home when the storm hit. Whatever happened to Andrea Gail happened very quickly.\\" An Air National Guard helicopter was dispatched from Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base on Long Island, New York, but not in response to the Andrea Gail or Satori (Mistral in the movie). The helicopter departed mid-storm on a mission to help save a lone Japanese fisherman from a sinking sailboat 250 miles off the New Jersey coast. Unsuccessful and running low on fuel, the Air National Guard Sikorsky HH-60G helicopter was compelled to attempt a mid-flight refueling maneuver. The zero- visibility conditions thwarted their efforts, however, and lacking enough fuel to make the flight back to the Long Island base, the crew were forced to ditch the helicopter. After a search by Tamaroa, four of the HH-60's crew were picked up; one was never seen again. The Japanese yachtsman was later rescued by a Romanian cargo ship. When asked about the portrayal of \\"Sully\\" in the movie, Cathy Sullivan Mustone, an older sister of David \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, said she was disappointed. \\"They made my brother's character out to be a hothead,\\" she said. \\"I guess every movie needs a villain, but my brother was a funny guy with a loud laugh and a big smile. He had a lot of guts and he loved fishing.\\" In fact, David's bravery and quick thinking made headlines on a different boat‚ÄîHarmony. One night during a winter fishing trip, Harmony began taking on water while tied to another boat. The crew of Harmony yelled for help, hoping to wake the nearby crew. No one woke, so David dove into the icy water, pulling himself on the ropes that tied the boats together. As a result of his bravery, Harmony's crew was saved. Mustone said, \\"At least in the movie, they did represent my brother's bravery in a water rescue scene. He was a good man. And I just know he is at peace in heaven, safe with our Dad.\\" =The Satori= The crew members of Satori (renamed Mistral in the movie) were not rescued by an Air National Guard helicopter, but rather by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter. The helicopter was changed in the film after the Air National Guard had issues consulting with the movie producers. According to the owner's son, Satori never made a 360¬∞ roll, although it had two knockdowns, during which it lay on its side for about 30 seconds. In response to requests by the crew, Captain Ray Leonard permitted the two crewmembers to make a position report over radio, during which they made an unauthorized Mayday call. One of those crewmembers reported that she was so convinced that she was going to die that she wrote her name down and put it into a plastic bag duct-taped to her stomach so her body could be identified. There is controversy over whether the Captain was drunk, as charged by the women in the book, with Leonard objecting to this characterization. Out of compassion for the expected loss of his boat, the Coast Guard did not test his blood alcohol levels at the time. The Coast Guard declared the voyage manifestly unsafe and ordered everyone off-board, including the unwilling skipper. The Coast Guard first tried to take them on board via an inflatable boat, but after it was damaged when trying to approach Satori they sent a helicopter, which is a much riskier approach, as a rescue swimmer must jump into dangerous seas. The Coast Guard helicopter did not try to lower rescue gear onto the yacht (as shown in the movie, where it gets entangled with the mast), but rather asked the crew of Satori to jump overboard to meet a rescue swimmer in the water. Leonard eventually complied with the request. After the storm, Leonard searched for the Satori, hoping to find her still afloat, but in spite of his attempts she was found a few days later washed ashore on a Maryland beach, a bag of personal belongings still on deck. Leonard paid for a 60-foot fishing vessel to drag her off the beach, helped by a channel dug by Park Rangers who had been guarding the boat. He continued to sail the boat until he sold her to a new owner in 2000.  Reception  The Perfect Storm received mixed reviews from critics, with a 47% approval rating on critic site Rotten Tomatoes with a consensus of, \\"While the special effects are well done and quite impressive, this film suffers a lack of any actual drama or characterization. The end result is a film that offers nifty eye-candy and nothing else.\\" The Perfect Storm was a box office success. On its opening weekend, it debuted with $42 million ahead of Sony's The Patriot and eventually brought in over $182.6 million in the United States, and $146.1 million around the world to a total of $328.7 million worldwide. The film was nominated for 2 Academy Awards, Best Visual Effects (Walt Conti, Stefen Fangmeier, John Frazier and Habib Zargarpour) and Best Sound (John T. Reitz, Gregg Rudloff, David E. Campbell and Keith A. Wester), but lost both to Gladiator. However, it was also nominated for a Stinker Award for Most Intrusive Musical Score.https://web.archive.org/web/20070105221207/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2000/2000st.htm Filming The movie was partially filmed in Dedham, Massachusetts. Lawsuits After the film was released, the families of two crew members sued the film makers for the fictionalization of events which happened prior to the loss of Andrea Gail. In 2005, the Florida Supreme Court ruled against the family of Captain Tyne by a 6‚Äì2 vote. Some unnamed families also sued the producers in federal district court, claiming that their names were used without their permission, and that facts were changed. The district court, which is also located in Florida, dismissed the case, as in their opinion the defendants' First Amendment right to freedom of speech barred the suit. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which could not decide how to interpret the Florida law at issue and certified the question to the Florida Supreme Court. In the end, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the district court's interpretation of Florida law, and thereupon the 11th Circuit affirmed the prior decision to dismiss the case.

In 2015 Socrates Kokkalis net worth is estimated to be around US$1.2 billion. Kokkalis founded Intracom in 1977 as a telecommunication equipment supplier and manufacturer. The company played a leading role in the modernization of telecommunication infrastructure in Greece, especially through a partnership with Ericsson for the manufacturing of digital switches. Intracom expanded in Southeastern Europe and became a leading exporting technology Group, including the areas of software for the public sector, defense electronics and construction. It is listed in the Athens Stock Exchange since 1990. Kokkalis founded Intralot in 1992, as a hardware and software supplier for the gaming industry. Intralot became one of the three top companies in the sector worldwide, currently with 5,400 employees and presence in 35 countries. Intralot has a strong presence in the United States, with a 20% market share for lotteries, offering its services to 11 State Lotteries. Kokkalis also led Panafon, the mobile venture of Vodafone in Greece, immediately after the launch of mobile telephony in Greece in 1992. In 2005 Intracom became a Holding company and acquired Hellas Online, an ISP provider which became a major telephony and Internet supplier. Hellas Online was sold to Vodafone in 2014. The same year Intracom Holdings divested also form the telecom manufacturing arm, Intracom Telecom.

The (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi character dictionary, defines y√≠ as \\"men of the east\\" . The dictionary also informs that y√≠ Â§∑ is not dissimilar from the Xi√† , which means referred to the Chinese. Elsewhere in the Shuowen Jiezi, under the entry of qiang , the term y√≠ is associated with benevolence and human longevity. Y√≠ countries are therefore virtuous places where people live long lives. This is why Confucius wanted to go to y√≠ countries when the dao could not be realized in the central states.Xu Shen Ë®±ÊÖé, Shuowen Jieji Ë™™ÊñáËß£Â≠ó (Beijing: Zhonghua Shuju, 1963), 213, 78. The scholar L√©on Wieger provided multiple definitions to the term y√≠: \\"The men Â§ß armed with bows Âºì, the primitive inhabitants, barbarians, borderers of the Eastern Sea, inhabitants of the South-West countries.\\"Wieger, L√©on (1927), Chinese Characters: Their Origin, Etymology, History, Classification and Signification. A Thorough Study from Chinese Documents, tr. by L. Davrout, 2nd edition, Dover reprint, p. 156. Bernhard Karlgren says that in the bronze script for y√≠ inscribed on Zhou Dynasty (c. 1045 BCE ‚Äì c. 256 BCE) Chinese bronze inscriptions, \\"The graph has 'man' and 'arrow', or 'arrow' with something wound around the shaft.\\"Karlgren 1957:147 The Yi, or Dongyi, are associated with the bow and arrow: K. C. Wu says the modern character designating the historical \\"Y√≠ peoples\\", is composed of the characters for Â§ß \\"big (person)\\" and Âºì \\"bow\\"; which implies a big person carrying a bow, and also that this old form of this Chinese Character was composed with an association of a certain group of people with the use of the bow in mind.Wu, 107‚Äì108 Some classic Chinese history records like Zuo Zhuan, Shuowen Jiezi, Classic of Rites, all have some similar records about this.Shuowen Jiezi, It was the ancient Dongyi people Yimou who first made the arrow.„ÄäËØ¥ÊñáËß£Â≠ó¬∑Áü¢ÈÉ®„Äã:\\"Âè§ËÄÖÂ§∑ÁâüÂàù‰ΩúÁü¢\\"Classic of Rites, It was Hui who made the bow and Yimo who made the arrow.„ÄäÁ§ºËÆ∞¬∑Â∞Ñ‰πâ„Äã: \\"Êå•‰ΩúÂºìÔºåÂ§∑Áâü‰ΩúÁü¢\\" The earliest records of yi were inscribed on oracle bones dating from the late Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 ‚Äì c. 1046 BCE). This oracle bone script was used interchangeably for y√≠ Â§∑, r√©n \\"human\\", and shƒ´ \\"corpse; personator of the dead; inactive; lay out\\". The archeologist and scholar Guo Moruo believed the oracle graph for yi denotes \\"a dead body, i.e., the killed enemy\\", while the bronze graph denotes \\"a man bound by a rope, i.e., a prisoner or slave\\".Huang Yang (2013), \\"Perceptions of the Barbarian in Early Greece and China \\", CHS Research Bulletin 2.1, translating Guo Moruo, (1933, 1982), ÂçúËæ≠ÈÄöÁ∫Ç, Á¨¨‰∫îÂÖ≠‰πùÁâá, p. 462. The historical linguist explains this oracle character depicts either a \\"corpse\\"' with two bent legs or a \\"barbarian\\" custom of sitting with one's legs stretched out instead of the Chinese norm of squatting on one's heels.Xu 1988:942. The early China historian Li Feng says the Western Zhou bronze graph for Y√≠ was \\"differentiated from r√©n ‰∫∫ (human) by its kneeling gesture, clearly implying a population that was deemed a potential source of slaves or servants\\", thus meaning \\"foreign conquerable\\".Li (2006), p. 286. Axel Schuessler hypothesizes an Old Chinese etymological development from *li Â§∑ \\"extend; expose; display; set out; spread out\\" to *lhi Â∞∏ \\"to spread out; lie down flat (in order to sleep); motionless; to set forth (sacrificial dishes)\\", to \\"personator of a dead ancestor\\", and to \\"corpse\\".Schuessler 2007:564‚Äì565. = Etymology & Linguistic Classification = Historical linguists have tentatively reconstructed y√≠ Â§∑'s ancient pronunciations and etymology. The Modern Standard Chinese pronunciation y√≠ descends from (c. 6th‚Äì9th centuries CE) Middle Chinese and (c. 6th‚Äì3rd centuries BCE) Old Chinese. Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of y√≠ Â§∑ \\"barbarian; spread out\\" include i < *dj…ôr,Karlgren 1957:148. yij < *lj…®j,Baxter 1992:279. ji…™ < *lil,Zhengzhang 2003:525. and ji < *l…ôi.Schuessler 2009:279. As to the most recent reconstruction, William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart (2014)Baxter, William H. and Laurent Sagart. 2014. Old Chinese: A New Reconstruction. Oxford University Press, . reconstruct the Old Chinese name of y√≠ Â§∑ as *l…ôj. As Yu√®ju√®sh≈´ () states that the Yue word for \\"sea\\" is also Â§∑ (*li ‚Üí y√≠), Sinologist Axel Schuessler proposes an Austroasiatic etymology for the ethnonym *li by comparing to Khmer dhle \\"sea\\", from Pre-Angkorian Old Khmer danle(y) \\"large expanse of water\\"; thus the ethnonym might have referred to a people living by the sea,Schuessler 2007:564‚Äì565. When analyzing possible Austroasiatic loanwords into Old Chinese, Schuessler noticed that that one layer of loanwords, from one or more Austroasiatic language(s) into Old Chinese spoken in the Yellow River basin, showed affinities to modern Khmeric and Khmuic languages, and occasionally to Monic.Schuessler 2007:4-5. Earlier, Edwin G. Pulleyblank (1983, 1999) also proposed that the Yi were Austroasiatic speakers. Laurent Sagart (2008) instead suggested that the Yi languages were ancestral to Austronesian languages and formed a sister-group to Sino-Tibetan. = Usages = The sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank describes how Yi usages semantically changed. \\"Their name furnished the primary Chinese term for 'barbarian' and is sometimes used in such a generalized sense as early as the Spring and Autumn period. At the same time it continued to have a specific reference, denoting especially the Yi of the Huai river region, who constituted a recognized political entity. Paradoxically the Yi were considered the most 'civilized' of the non-Chinese peoples.\\"Pulleyblank, E. G. (1983). \\"The Chinese and Their Neighbors in Prehistoric and Early Historic Times\\". In Keightley, David N., ed. The Origins of Chinese civilization. p. 440. University of California Press.  Pre-Qin usages  Zhou dynasty cosmography of Huaxia and the Siyi: Dongyi in the east, Nanman in the south, Xirong in the west, and Beidi in the north. It is not easy to determine the times of people that a Classical Chinese document reflects. Literature describing a pre-Xia Dynasty period does not use the character yi. As for the Xi√† Dynasty, some groups of people are referred to as the Yi. For example, the Yu Gong chapter of the Shu Ji or Book of Documents terms people in Qingzhou and Xuzhou Laiyi (), Yuyi () and Huaiyi (). Another yi-related term is Jiu-yi (), literally Nine Yi, which could have also had the connotation The Numerous Yi or The Many Different Kinds of Yi, and which appears in a passage in The Analects that reads, \\"The Master (i.e., Confucius) desired to live among the Nine Yi.\\" The term \\"Dongyi\\" is not used for this period. Shang Dynasty oracle shell and bone writings record yi but not Dongyi. Shima Kunio's concordance of oracle inscriptions lists twenty occurrences of the script for Â§∑ or Â∞∏, most frequently (6 times) in the compound zhishi Á•âÂ∞∏ \\"bless the personator; blessed personator\\".Shima 1971:5. Michael Carr notes some contexts are ambiguous, but suggests, \\"Three compounds refer to 'barbarians' (in modern characters, fayi ‰ºêÂ§∑ 'attack barbarians', zhengyi ÂæÅÂ§∑ 'punish barbarians', and yifang Â§∑Êñπ 'barbarian regions').\\"Carr 2007:381-382 Oracle inscriptions record that Shang King Wu Ding (r. c. 1250‚Äì1192 BCE) made military expeditions on the Yi, and King Di Xin (r. c. 1075‚Äì1046 BCE) waged a massive campaign against the Yifang Â§∑Êñπ \\"barbarian regions\\". It appears that the Yifang were the same people as Huaiyi (Huai River Yi), Nanhuaiyi (Southern Huai Yi), Nanyi (Southern Yi) and Dongyi according to bronzeware inscriptions of the Western Zhou Dynasty. The Zhou Dynasty attempted to keep the Yi under its control. The most notable example of which is the successful campaign against the Huaiyi and the Dongyi led by the Duke of Zhou. On the other hand, historian Huang Yang notes that in the Shang period, \\"the term yi probably did not carry the sense of 'barbarian'. Rather it simply denoted one of the many tribes or regions that were the target of the Shang military campaigns ... We see, therefore, that at the beginning the yi might haven been certain particular tribe or group of people that was neighboring the Shang.\\"Huang Yang (2013), \\"Perceptions of the Barbarian in Early Greece and China \\", CHS Research Bulletin 2.1 During the Spring and Autumn period, Jin, Zheng, Qi and Song tried to seize control of the Huai River basin, which was occupied by the Huaiyi, but the region ultimately fell under the influence of Chu to the south. At the same time, people in the east and south ceased to be called Dongyi as they founded their own states. These Yifang states included the states of Xu, Lai, Zhongli, Ju and Jiang. The small state of Jie was based around present-day Jiaozhou.. The state of Xu occupied large areas of modern Jiangsu and Anhui provinces between the Huai and Yangtze Rivers. Eventually, after warring with Chu and Wu, it was conquered by the State of Wu in 512 BCE. Chu annexed the State of Jiang, destroyed the State of Ju whose territory was annexed by the State of Qi. Recent archaeological excavations reveal that the State of Xu's presence extended to western Jiangxi in modern Jing'an County. This includes bronzeware inscriptions about the State of Xu and also a tomb with many nanmu coffins containing sacrificial female victims. Dongyi customs include burials with many sacrificial victims and veneration of the sun. References to Dongyi became ideological during the Warring States period, owing to cultural changes in Chinese concepts of Self and Other. When the (c. 4th BCE) Classic of Rites recorded stereotypes about the Siyi \\"Four Barbarians\\" (Dongyi, Xirong, Nanman, and Beidi) in the four directions, Dongyi had acquired a clearly pejorative nuance. > The people of those five regions ‚Äì the Middle states, and the [Rong], [Yi], > (and other wild tribes round them) ‚Äì had all their several natures, which > they could not be made to alter.

James Legge (1879), The Li Ki, Clarendon > Press, vol.1, pp. 229‚Äì230.  Post-Qin usages  The more \\"China\\" expanded, the further east the term \\"Dongyi\\" was applied to. The Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian uses the term \\"Manyi\\" (), but not \\"Dongyi\\". It puts the section of \\"Xinanyi (southwestern Yi) liezhuan (biographies)\\", but not \\"Dongyi liezhuan\\". The Book of Han does not put this section either but calls a Dongye () chief in the Korean Peninsula as Dongyi. The Book of Later Han puts the section of \\"Dongyi liezhuan (Êù±Â§∑ÂàóÂÇ≥)\\" and covers Buyeo, Yilou, Goguryeo, Eastern Okjeo, Hui, Samhan and Wa, in other words, eastern Manchuria, Korea, Japan and some other islands. The Book of Jin positioned Dongyi inside the section of \\"Siyi\\" (barbarians in four directions) along with \\"Xirong\\", \\"Nanman\\" and \\"Beidi\\". The Book of Sui, the Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang adopt the section of \\"Dongyi\\" and covers eastern Manchuria, Korea, Japan and optionally Sakhalin and Taiwan. During the Song Dynasty, the official history books replaced Dongyi with Waiguo () and Waiyi ().  Other usage of Dongyi in Chinese history books  ; Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han : These two history books do not assign many chapters to describe the history of Dongyi. However, it includes the simple description Manchuria, Wiman Joseon and Wa. Wiman fled from the state of Yan to Gojoseon, and he disguised himself as a Gojoseon person.

This book contains the chapter of 'Dongyi', which describes the history of Manchuria and Korea including Buyeo, Goguryeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and Samhan, and Japan including Wa.

Although initially described as nomadic, they seem to have practiced a mixed pastoral, agricultural, and hunting economy and were distinguished from the nomads of the Eurasian steppe (Hu) who lived to their north. Chinese historical accounts describe the Di inhabiting the upper Ordos Loop (mostly in northern Shaanxi) and gradually migrating eastward to northern Shanxi and Hebei, where they eventually created their own states like Zhongshan and Dai. Other groups of Di seem to have lived interspersed between the Chinese states before their eventual conquest or assimilation. Name The ancient Chinese, whose Xia, Shang, and Zhou states flourished along the Fen, Yellow, and Wei valleys, discussed their neighbors according to the cardinal directions. The \\"Four Barbarians\\" (Siyi) were the Di to the north, the Man to the south, the Yi to the east, and the Rong to the west. These came to be used as generic chauvinistic pejoratives for different foreign peoples long after the Chinese conquests of the original tribes and so are all usually translated as \\"barbarian\\" in English.

The Di were often associated with the Rong; both were considered more warlike and less civilized than the Yi or Man. According to the Records of the Grand Historian, the ancestors of the Zhou lived in lands near the Rong and Di for fourteen generations, until Gugong Danfu led then away to the mid-Wei River valley where they built their capital near Mount Qi. During the Eastern Zhou, the Chinese states‚Äîparticularly Jin‚Äîexpanded into Di territories, after which the Di were often their enemies. The \\"White Di\\" lived north of Qin and west of the Yellow River in what is now northern Shaanxi through the first half of the Spring and Autumn Period; tribes began crossing the river into northern Shanxi in the second half. *676-651 BC: Duke Xian of Jin conquered a number of Rong and Di groups. *662 BC: The Di drove the Rong out of Taiyuan. *662-659 BC: The state of Xing was nearly destroyed by the Red Di until it was rescued by the State of Qi. *660 BC: The Red Di took the capital of the State of Wey and killed its ruler, but were driven out by Qi. *660 to 507 BC: Jin fought many wars with the Di. The Di eventually also established treaties of marriage and trade with the various Chinese states. The Jin prince Chong'er fled to his mother's family among them for many years until assassins sent by his brother forced him to begin wandering through the Chinese states. *640 BC: The Di were allied with Qi and Xing against Wey. *636 BC: The Di helped the Zhou king against the state of Cheng. The Xianyu and \\"White Di\\" moved east from the areas around the Yellow River in north Shaanxi and northwest Shanxi into the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi and Hebei during the 6th century. The \\"White Di\\" were especially numerous on the upper reaches of the Xinding or Hutuo Valley. *594 BC: Jin 'destroyed' the Red Di state of Lushi (ÊΩûÊ∞è). In 569, the Dao Duke of Jin announced a new peaceful policy towards the barbarians (ÂíåÊàé, he Rong). He ended Jin's expansionist invasions of foreign lands and instead bartered with their leaders, purchasing territory for valuable Chinese objects like ritual bronzes and bells. During this period, the \\"White Di\\" began to move east of Taiyuan and the Taihang Mountains.

Using restored archive footage, the film traces the development of nuclear weapons and their testing, from America's Trinity test of 1945 (hence the title) to the first Chinese atomic bomb test in 1964. Kuran's commentary on the DVD version claims that the DVD replaces some of the original footage with better-quality versions. There are some short special effects sequences too. The film has also since been released on Blu-ray. Included is footage of nuclear tests starting with the May 1945 trial run to Trinity (the first atomic bomb), a 100-ton TNT blast used to scale and calibrate the Trinity device, and ending with the last U.S. atmospheric nuclear detonation (called Tightrope) of the Nike Hercules air defense missile in 1963. Also included are test series in the South Pacific, footage of the firing of the U.S. Army's atomic cannon at the Nevada Test Site in 1953, and color images of multi-megaton high altitude air bursts over Johnston Island just before the limited test ban treaty went into effect (banning all except underground detonations) in 1963. The film's publicity claims that much of the American footage is newly declassified and previously unseen. Kuran's research brought him into contact with many of the cameramen who photographed the American tests, leading to the production of another documentary, Atomic Filmmakers which featured their reminiscences of working on the program. A new patented image restoration process was used for the first time to improve considerably the image quality of old and fading film stock.Film Preservation / Color Restoration - VCEinc, AtomCentral.com. Accessed December 30, 2009. The film's music (composed by William T. Stromberg) was performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, symbolizing the end of the cold war. The score was later used in some trailers for the X-Men movies. Footage from a Soviet documentary about the Tsar Bomba is featured in Trinity and Beyond, where it is referred to as the Russian monster bomb.\\"Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie.\\" Nuclear Weapon Archive, 15 August 1999.

The word is related to the Hebrew qorbƒÅn \\"offering\\" and Syriac qurbƒÅnƒÅ \\"sacrifice\\", etymologised through the cognate Arabic triliteral as \\"a way or means of approaching someone\\" or \\"nearness\\".Ambros, Arne Amadeus. 2004. A Concise Dictionary of Koranic Arabic. Wiesbaden: Reichert. P. 2Gg22 [Q-R-B] In Islamic law, udhiyyah would refer to the sacrifice of a specific animal, offered by a specific person, on specific days to seek God's pleasure and reward. The word qurban appears thrice in the Quran: once in reference to animal sacrifice and twice referring to sacrifice in the general sense of any act which may bring one closer to God. In contrast, dhabƒ´·∏•ah refers to normal Islamic slaughter outside the day of udhiyyah.  Origins  Islam traces the history of sacrifice back to Abel and Cain (Habil and Qabil), whose story is mentioned in the Qur'an. Abel was the first human being to sacrifice an animal for God. Ibn Kathir narrates that Abel had offered a sheep whilst his brother Cain offered part of the crops of his land. The ordained procedure of God was that a fire would descend from the heavens and consume the accepted sacrifice. Accordingly, fire came down and enveloped the animal slaughtered by Abel thus accepting the sacrifice of Abel while Cain's sacrifice was rejected. This led to jealousy on the part of Cain resulting in the first human death when he murdered his brother Abel. After not seeking repentance for his actions, Cain was not forgiven by God. = Ibrahim's sacrifice = The practice of qurbani can be traced back to Ibrahim, who dreamt that God ordered him to sacrifice his most precious thing. Ibrahim was in a dilemma as he couldn't determine what was his most precious thing. Then he realized it was his son's life. He had faith in God's command. He let his son know the purpose why he was taking his son out of their home. His son Ismail agreed to follow God's command, however, God intervened and informed him that his sacrifice had been accepted, and replaced his son with a sheep. This replacement seems to point to either the religious institutionalisation of sacrifice itself, or to the future self- sacrifices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions (who were destined to emerge from the progeny of Ishmael) in the cause of their faith. From that day onward, every Eid al-Adha once a year, Muslims around the world slaughter an animal to commemorate Ibrahim's sacrifice and to remind themselves of abnegation. = Wisdom of sacrifice = The philosophy behind udhiyyah is that it is a demonstration of submission to God, complete obedience to God's will or command and sacrificing belonging for him. Ibrahim demonstrated this spirit of submission and sacrifice in the best possible manner. When confronted with the challenge of love and allegiance, he chose to submit unconditionally to God and suppressed personal desire and love for his family and child. Qurbani calls for the slaughter of one's innate desires by placing the knife of courage and resistance on hatred, jealousy, pride, greed, animosity, love for the world and other such maladies of the heart.  Ritual sacrifice  In Islam, the sacrifice of an animal is legal from the morning of the 10th to the sunset of the 13th Dhu l-Hijjah, the 12th lunar month of the Islamic calendar. On these days Muslims all over the world offer Qurbani which means a sacrifice or slaughter of an animal on specific days. It is understood as a symbolic repetition of Ibrahim's sacrifice of a ram in place of his son, a crucial notion in Judaism, and Islam alike. Islamic preachers would use the occasion to comment on the fact that Islam is a religion of sacrifice and use this opportunity to remind Muslims of their duty of serving mankind with their time, effort and wealth. Most schools of fiqh accept that the animal must be slaughtered according to the laws of dhabihah and that the animal in question must be a domesticated goat, sheep, cow or camel.  Martyred  The term is also used for those who have been martyred.

Fantasy, the perfume, is the second perfume to be endorsed by Britney Spears. It was released in the US on September 15, 2005, following the successful previous perfume from Spears, \\"Curious\\", which made over $30 million in sales in the first three months of its launch. The Fantasy fragrance line has currently seventeen perfumes: Fantasy, Midnight Fantasy, Hidden Fantasy, Circus Fantasy, Fantasy Twist, Island Fantasy, Fantasy Anniversary Edition, Fantasy The Nice Remix, Fantasy The Naughty Remix, Fantasy Stage Edition, Rocker Femme Fantasy, Fantasy Renner Edition, Fantasy Intimate Edition, Maui Fantasy, In Bloom Fantasy, Sunset Fantasy and Fantasy Pride Edition. Fantasy was created by Jim Krivda. Its notes are red lychee, golden quince, kiwi, cupcake accord, jasmine petals, white chocolate, orchid, musk, orris root and woods. The Fuchsia bottle once featured real Swarovski crystals embedded into the glass and the plastic collar until 2008. The believed reasoning behind the omission is because the glue of the crystal top would melt in higher temperatures, which many buyers realized a considerable time after purchase. The television commercial for Fantasy Britney Spears was shot in Los Angeles and was directed by Bille Woodruff. It stars actor‚Äìmodel Nick Steele as the Hunter, with the background music being \\"Breathe on Me\\". The ad's tagline is \\"Everybody has one\\".  Flanker fragrances  = Midnight Fantasy = A spin-off fragrance entitled Midnight Fantasy was released in December 2006, in some department stores, and January 2007 everywhere else. The bottle is a blue version of the original pink bottle. Midnight Fantasy is classified as a sensual, sweet, fruity, feminine, flowery fragrance. Fragrance notes: black cherries, plum, orchid, freesia, musk and amber. Midnight Fantasy is recommended for romantic wear. The perfume initially sold well in December. However, events in Spears' personal life in January affected sales of the perfume, with analysts reporting that people were returning holiday perfume gift sets to stores in larger numbers than expected. Sanders observed that \\"the timing couldn't be worse\\" for such a downturn in sales of the perfume, because the craze for celebrity perfumes was already declining across all fragrances, having fallen 17% to USD140 million in 2006. Sales have since reportedly started to rebound according to Macy's. In April 2007, Spears set out a paparazzi contest with the aim of promoting the perfume. In an electronic mail message sent to her fans, she asked them to \\"share what happens to you when the clock strikes 12\\", by photographing their friends. Commentators observed that Spears' requirement that photographs not contain \\"nudity, obscenity, or violent depictions\\" would rule out several photographs taken of Spears herself that contained nudity. = Hidden Fantasy = The perfume is a spin-off fragrance of the original perfume Fantasy and it hit the stores in January 2009.

His music is typically characterized as a ragga/rap style, that has found its fan base in France. Early life, family and education Born in Clichy-sous-Bois, France on May 10, 1974, Beausir's mother was of Guadeloupean origin and his father white. In 1990, he moved with his family to Paris, to Porte de la Chapelle, a district to which he would often pay homage in his songs. Career Doc Gyn√©co launched his career at age 19, writing a few tracks for the hardcore rap group Minist√®re AMER. After this rap group parted, Virgin Records signed him with the intent of converting his demos into an album in Paris. This project partially fell through; Doc Gyn√©co then traveled to Los Angeles to work with American producer Ken Kessie. The result of this work would be Premi√®re Consultation, released in April 1996, which received large media praise and huge success both in France and the world. Singles from the album include \\"Est-ce que √ßa le fait?\\", \\"Viens voir le docteur\\", \\"Dans Ma Rue\\", \\"Passements de Jambes\\", and \\"N√© Ici\\". In France, the album will sell more than 1 million copies. Two years later on December 1, 1998, his second album, Liaisons Dangereuses, was released. Although the main single \\"C'est Beau La Vie\\" was a flop, the album still sold reasonably well. Later in a radio interview, Doc Gyneco admitted that he regretted the collaboration he had with politician Bernard Tapie, saying ¬´Je vous le r√©p√®te, parfois je me goure¬ª (\\"I'm telling again, sometimes I slip up\\") . In the spring of 2001, Doc Gyn√©co's third album Quality Street was released. Guest stars on the album included the Wu-Tang Clan and Gregory Isaac. The album's first single, \\"Caramel\\", met little success, although it was also included on Putamayo Grooves, a compilation album. Doc Gyn√©co's fourth album Solitaire was released in August 2002. It proved to be popular. Doc Gyn√©co received the \\"Victoires de la Musique\\" award for Best Hip-hop/Rap Album of the Year. Singles included \\"Funky Maxime\\", \\"Frotti Frotta\\", and \\"Flash\\". 'Menu Best-of', a collection of his hit singles since the beginning of his career was released in 2004. During 2006 the album Homme Nature was released. After a musical break, he made a comeback in 2016 with a re-release of his first album, Premi√®re consultation, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album's release. In 2018, he released his seventh solo album, 1.000%.  Style  After the release of his first album, his sexual and provocative lyrics provoked discussion and criticism. However, the album sold 800,000 copies and Doc Gyn√©co became part of the popularising rap movement of the 1990s. His music, a mix of ragga and rap, addresses controversial subjects like drugs, sex, women, racism, and poverty. For example, one of his biggest hit at the time was ‚ÄúNirvana,‚Äù a pessimistic song in which he promotes the use of drugs: ‚ÄúJe veux me droguer aux aspirines fa√ßon Marilyn‚Äù (‚ÄòI wanna pop pills like Marilyn‚Äô). In this song he explains how damaged life is in our society and how it pushes him to use drugs and, eventually to commit suicide: ‚ÄúJe veux atteindre le Nirvana‚Äù (‚ÄòI want to reach Nirvana‚Äù). Like \\"Nirvana\\", a lot of his songs are very nostalgic and refer to poverty and the poor living conditions in French social housing estates. The reason for this is that he had actually lived in the such estates since birth. His song \\"N√© ici\\" ('Born here') expresses the perceived lack of social mobility among those living in the projects . He says: ‚ÄúMa m√®re est n√©e l√†-bas, mon p√®re est n√© l√†-bas, moi je suis n√© ici dans la mis√®re et les cris‚Äù ('My mom was born over there, my dad was born over there [in the Caribbean] but I was born here [in a Parisian housing estate] amidst all the poverty and pain'). Hence, one principal role for his work is to underline the issues of contemporary society. Like many French rap artists, his works caused controversy; he was criticized for demeaning the status of women. Not all critics characterized him that way, though; one wrote, \\"Unjustly attacked for misogyny, he is in fact capable of encapsulating complex poetic emotion into the crude language of a ghetto love song such as 'Ma Salope a Moi' - 'My Slut'.\\" He has also been criticized for promoting drug use, and dealing with other sensitive subjects (such as suicide in his song \\"Nirvana\\"). He stands apart, however, for rarely promoting violence in his works, something that had become a trademark for rap artists in France. He was part of a movement that popularized rap in the 1990s, along with groups such as IAM or Supr√™me NTM and took it to every home. His laid- back attitude, his style, as well as his appreciation, knowledge and involvement with popular or controversial subjects like football, sex or drugs all strongly contributed to his fame, particularly among France's adolescent population. Riding his popularity, his appearance in French television shows became regular, particularly at the start of the new century, using his appearance and style as a catalyst. Even though he appears as a womaniser, he does not promote violence in his videos. He disapproves of the acts of violence that occur in the projects. He says that the young people in the projects should not express themselves through violence because it will not improve their situation. Politics Unlike many French rappers, he is close to politicians Nicolas Sarkozy showing them his support during their presidential campaigns. Other rappers have denounced Gyn√©co as a traitor, not least since his current politics contrast against an earlier stage in his career when he was critical of the French state. ‚ÄúJe kiffe quand les keufs cannent (I get a kick when cops croak it).‚Äù ‚ÄúFrance is a country of cops. There are a hundred on every street corner. To keep order, they get away with murder.‚Äù In 2001 he claimed to be close to the Socialist Party, but in 2006, he joined the Union for a Popular Movement and announced his support for Nicolas Sarkozy in a party meeting in Marseille.

Because the date for national elections (as well as many state and local elections) is in early November, events that take place in October have greater potential to influence the decisions of prospective voters; thus, relatively last-minute news stories could either change the course of an election or reinforce the inevitable. The term \\"October surprise\\" was coined by William Casey when he served as campaign manager of Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. However, there were October election-upending events that predated the coining of the term. Prior to 1980 In mid-October 1840, shortly before the 1840 presidential election, federal prosecutors announced plans to charge top Whig Party officials with \\"most stupendous and atrocious fraud\\" for paying Pennsylvanians to cross state lines and vote for Whig candidates in New York during the 1838 elections. On October 20, 1880, shortly before the 1880 presidential election, a forged letter was published purportedly written by James A. Garfield voicing support for Chinese immigration to the United States. At the time, most white Americans opposed Chinese immigration and both presidential candidates were in favor of immigration restrictions. In the week leading up to the 1884 presidential election, Republican nominee James G. Blaine attended a meeting in which Presbyterian preacher Samuel D. Burchard claimed that the Democrats were the party of \\"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.\\" Blaine's failure to object to Burchard's message cost him support from anti-prohibitionists, Roman Catholic immigrants, and southerners. In the weeks leading up to the 1920 presidential election, rumors circulated that Warren G. Harding was of African-American descent. Harding's campaign feared that the rumor would affect his popularity amongst white southerners and so his campaign made it a point to prove Harding's whiteness. Less than a month before the 1940 presidential election, President Roosevelt's press secretary Stephen Early kneed a black police officer in the groin outside Madison Square Garden. Roosevelt had already been facing skepticism from black voters because of his failure to desegregate the military. Roosevelt responded days before the election by appointing the nation's first black general, Benjamin O. Davis Jr., and announcing the creation of the Tuskegee Airmen. The Suez Crisis and Hungarian Revolution have both been described as October surprises during the 1956 presidential election. On October 7, 1964, just under a month before the 1964 presidential election, one of President Johnson's top aides, Walter Jenkins, was arrested for disorderly conduct with another man at the Washington D.C. YMCA, a place described by the Toledo Blaze as \\"so notorious a gathering place of homosexuals that the District police had long since staked it out with peepholes for surveillance.\\" However, a week later, Nikita Khrushchev was ousted from power by hardliners in the Soviet Union, the Labour Party won the United Kingdom election and China conducted its first nuclear weapons test. During the 1968 presidential election, Hubert Humphrey‚Äîwho was rising sharply in the polls due to the collapse of the Wallace vote‚Äîbegan to distance himself publicly from the Johnson administration on the Vietnam War, calling for a bombing halt. The key turning point for Humphrey's campaign came when President Johnson officially announced a bombing halt, and even a possible peace deal, the weekend before the election. The \\"Halloween Peace\\" gave Humphrey's campaign a badly needed boost. In addition, Senator Eugene McCarthy finally endorsed Humphrey in late October after previously refusing to do so, and by election day the polls were reporting a dead heat.Theodore H. White, The Making of the President, 1968 (1970) During the 1972 presidential election between Republican incumbent Richard Nixon and Democrat George McGovern, the United States was in the fourth year of negotiations to end the lengthy and domestically divisive Vietnam War. On October 26, 1972, twelve days before the election on November 7, the United States' chief negotiator and presidential National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger appeared at a press conference held at the White House and announced \\"We believe that peace is at hand.\\"Kissinger 2003:591 Nixon, despite having vowed to end the war during his presidential election campaign four years earlier, had failed to cease hostilities but significantly reduced American involvement, especially ground forces. While Nixon was nevertheless already widely considered to be assured of re-election, Kissinger's \\"peace is at hand\\" declaration increased Nixon's already high standing with the electorate: in the event, Nixon defeated McGovern in every state except Massachusetts and won by 23.2 points in the nationwide popular vote, which was the largest margin since 1936. Remaining U.S. ground forces were withdrawn in 1973, but U.S. military involvement in Vietnam continued until 1975. 1980: Carter vs. Reagan In the 1980 presidential election, Republican challenger Ronald Reagan feared that a last-minute deal to release American hostages held in Iran might earn incumbent Jimmy Carter enough votes to win re-election. As it happened, in the days prior to the election, press coverage was consumed with the Iranian government's decision‚Äîand Carter's simultaneous announcement‚Äîthat the hostages would not be released until after the election. It was first written about in a Jack Anderson article in The Washington Post in the fall of 1980, in which he alleged that the Carter administration was preparing a major military operation in Iran for rescuing U.S. hostages in order to help him get re-elected. Subsequent allegations surfaced against Reagan alleging that his team had impeded the hostage release to negate the potential boost to the Carter campaign. After the release of the hostages on January 20, 1981, minutes after Reagan's inauguration, some charged that the Reagan campaign had made a secret deal with the Iranian government whereby the Iranians would hold the hostages until after Reagan was elected and inaugurated. Gary Sick, member of the National Security council under Presidents Ford and Carter (before being relieved of his duties weeks into Reagan's term) made the accusation in a New York Times editorial reprinted in in the run-up to the 1992 election. The initial bipartisan response from Congress was skeptical: House Democrats refused to authorize an inquiry, and Senate Republicans denied a $600,000 appropriation for a probe. Eight former hostages also sent an open letter demanding an inquiry in 1991. In subsequent Congressional testimony, Sick said that the popular media had distorted and misrepresented the accusers, reducing them to \\"gross generalizations\\" and \\"generic conspiracy theorists\\". Sick penned a book on the subject and sold the movie rights to it for a reported $300,000. His sources and thesis were contested by a number of commentators on both sides of the aisle. Abolhassan Banisadr, the former President of Iran, has also stated \\"that the Reagan campaign struck a deal with Tehran to delay the release of the hostages in 1980\\", asserting that \\"by the month before the American Presidential election in November 1980, many in Iran's ruling circles were openly discussing the fact that a deal had been made between the Reagan campaign team and some Iranian religious leaders in which the hostages' release would be delayed until after the election so as to prevent President Carter's re-election.\\" He repeated the charge in My Turn to Speak: Iran, the Revolution & Secret Deals with the U.S.Abolhassan Banisadr. My Turn to Speak: Iran, the Revolution and Secret Deals With the U.S.. From a series of interviews with Jean-Charles Deniau. Foreword by L. Bruce Laingen. Washington, D.C.: Potomac Books, 1991. . Translation of Abol Hassan Bani Sadr. Le complot des ayatollahs. Propos recueillis par Jean-Charles Deniau. Paris: La D√©couverte, 1989. Two separate congressional investigations looked into the charges, both concluding that there was no plan to seek to delay the hostages' release. In a memoir by Joseph V. Reed Jr. it is revealed that the \\"team\\" around David Rockefeller \\"collaborated closely with the Reagan campaign in its efforts to pre-empt and discourage what it derisively labeled an 'October surprise'‚Äîa pre-election release of the American hostages, the papers show. The Chase team helped the Reagan campaign gather and spread rumors about possible payoffs to win the release, a propaganda effort that Carter administration officials have said impeded talks to free the captives.\\" 1992: Bush vs. Clinton In October, 1992, breaking news came out that says the following: In June 1992, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was indicted in the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. Though he claims to have been opposed to the sale on principle, Weinberger participated in the transfer of United States TOW missiles to Iran that were used to stop Saddam Hussein's massive tank army, and was later indicted on several felony charges of lying to the Iran-Contra independent counsel during its investigation. Republicans angrily accused Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh of timing Weinberger's indictment to hurt George H. W. Bush's re-election chances. As Weinberger's trial approached, more concrete information on Bush's direct role emerged, including statements by Reagan Middle East specialist Howard Teicher that Bush knew of the arms deal in spring 1986 and an Israeli memo that made it clear that Bush was well versed in the deal by July 1986. 2000: Gore vs. Bush Days before the November 7 election, Thomas J. Connolly of Scarborough, Maine, a prominent defense attorney and 1998 Democratic candidate for governor, confirmed to a reporter that Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush had been arrested for drunk driving in that state in 1976. Bush confirmed the report in a press conference moments after it was revealed. 2003 California governor recall election On October 2, 2003, the Los Angeles Times released a story about Arnold Schwarzenegger and subsequent allegations that he was a womanizer guilty of multiple acts of sexual misconduct in past decades. The story was released just before the 2003 California recall (which was scheduled for October 7), prompting many pundits to charge that the timing of the story was aimed specifically at derailing the recall campaign. It was not the only embarrassing story about Schwarzenegger to surface just days before the campaign: the next day, ABC News and The New York Times reported that in 1975 Schwarzenegger had praised Adolf Hitler during interviews for the film Pumping Iron, which was responsible for the bodybuilder-turned-actor's fame. The twin controversies later led Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez to coin the term \\"gropenfuhrer\\" to describe California's governor-elect (a compounded pun on the Nazi paramilitary rank Gruppenf√ºhrer and the words to grope and F√ºhrer); a series of Doonesbury strips made the term famous. 2004: Bush vs. Kerry On October 27, The New York Times reported the disappearance of a huge cache of explosives from a warehouse in al Qa'qaa (see Missing explosives in Iraq). The John Kerry campaign blamed the Bush administration for this supposed mismanagement; administration officials charged that the Times had gotten the story wrong, and that the explosives had been cleared from the storage facility before the looting was supposed to have taken place. On October 29, the Arabic news agency Al Jazeera aired a video of Osama bin Laden. In a speech that justified and took responsibility for the actions of September 11, bin Laden called out the Bush administration and the American position in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. \\"Your security does not lie in the hands of Kerry, Bush, or al-Qaeda,\\" bin Laden claimed; \\"Your security is in your own hands.\\" This is believed to have helped President Bush's campaign as it thrust the War on Terror back into the public eye. There is debate as to whether bin Laden was aware of the effect the video would have on the elections; the \\"Bush bounce\\" from the video did not surprise most outside observers of the 2004 election. It has been claimed that Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud cut the price of oil (thus reducing gas prices) to help ensure a Bush victory. According to a 60 Minutes broadcast, \\"Prince Bandar enjoys easy access to the Oval Office. His family and the Bush family are close. And Woodward told us that Bandar has promised the president that Saudi Arabia will lower oil prices in the months before the election to ensure the U.S. economy is strong on Election Day.\\" 2006 midterm elections Two studies by The Lancet on mortality in Iraq before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq have been described as October surprises for the 2004 and 2006 elections. Les Roberts acknowledged that the 2004 study was timed to appear just before the presidential election,National Journal, Data Bomb though he denied that it was meant to favor one candidate over another. Although the studies used standard epidemiological methods, was peer reviewed and supported by a majority of statisticians and epidemiologists, political critics have dismissed the studies based on a variety of alleged shortcomings. The Mark Foley scandal, in which the congressman resigned over sexual computer messages that he exchanged with underage congressional pages, broke on September 28, 2006, and dominated the news in early October. Bloomberg.com wrote, \\"The October surprise came early this election year....\\" Allegations that both Republicans and Democrats had knowledge of Foley's actions months before the breaking of the story only fueled the speculation regarding the possibly politically motivated timing of the story's release. News that the Saddam Hussein trial verdict would be rendered on November 5, 2006, just two days ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, led Tom Engelhardt of magazine The Nation to dub it, on October 17, the \\"November Surprise\\". In a White House Press gaggle on November 4, 2006, a reporter suggested that the timing of the verdict might be an attempt to influence the outcome of the November election, to which White House Press Secretary Tony Snow replied \\"Are you smoking rope?\\" Snow later told CNN's Late Edition, \\"The idea is preposterous, that somehow we've been scheming and plotting with the Iraqis\\". 2008: McCain vs. Obama On October 31, 2008, four days before the 2008 presidential election, the Associated Press reported that Zeituni Onyango, half-aunt of Democratic candidate Barack Obama, was living as an illegal immigrant in Boston. She had been denied asylum and ordered to leave the United States in 2004. Some have also described the October 2008 record rise in unemployment as an \\"October Surprise\\". 2012: Obama vs. Romney Hurricane Sandy was labelled the October surprise by some in the media.Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who had been a staunch critic of President Barack Obama, was seen praising the response of the Obama administration.  2014 midterm elections  The Ebola virus epidemic was considered an October surprise by some media outlets. 2016: Clinton vs. Trump On October 7, a recording from 2005 was released in which Republican Party nominee Donald Trump, using explicit language, claimed \\"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything\\". Several politicians from both major parties expressed their disapproval of these remarks. Trump, who had been accused of sexism on several occasions before, later apologized for these remarks, saying they \\"don't reflect who I am.\\" But the remarks led to many Republicans withdrawing their endorsement from Trump including Arizona Senator John McCain, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, and Carly Fiorina. Many others who had not previously endorsed him asked him to step aside as the Republican nominee, including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The same day, WikiLeaks began a two month campaign of releasing emails and excerpts from the account of John Podesta. They would later become known as the Podesta Leaks. They shed a negative light on Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton and included recordings of excerpts of speeches given by Clinton to a variety of banks, a debate question being leaked to Clinton prior to the debate, a stance on trade-deals different from those purported by Clinton during her campaign, along with her belief that it is beneficial to hold both public and private beliefs. Also on the same day, U.S. intelligence agencies publicly accused the Russian government of using computer hacking to interfere with the election process. Three weeks later, on October 28, then- FBI Director James Comey announced in a letter to Congress that he would take \\"appropriate investigative steps\\" to review additional emails related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. This was announced after newly discovered emails were found on a computer that was seized by the FBI during an investigation of former congressman Anthony Weiner who had been accused of sending explicit pictures to a minor. According to law enforcement officials, the emails were found on a computer used by both Weiner and his then-wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Several hours later, Hillary Clinton responded to the decision of the Director by calling on the FBI to be fully transparent and to release \\"full and complete facts\\" on what the emails contained. On October 30, it was reported that 650,000 emails on Weiner's computer were to be investigated, potentially being relevant to this particular and other cases.  2018 midterm elections  A caravan of migrants from Central America became the \\"October surprise\\" of 2018. President Trump tweeted information about the caravan, and later released a Republican television advertisement that many criticized as racist (Fox News, NBC, and Facebook removed the advertisement after they considered it racist and CNN refused to air it). The story dominated discussion on many news networks, with many pundits criticizing Trump. News host Shepard Smith said on his Fox News show that the migrant caravan \\"hysteria\\" was actually intended to stoke fear before the midterm election and ridiculed Trump's claims.  2020: Trump vs. Biden On September 27, the New York Times published a discovery and analysis of Donald Trump's taxes since becoming president. The analysis found that Donald Trump only paid $750 in Federal Income Taxes for the years 2016 and 2017. The article has also revealed that Donald Trump is allegedly in debt to creditors to a sum of over 400 million dollars. Forbes magazine later revealed on October 16 that the debt in question was actually an amount allegedly exceeding 1 billion dollars. On October 2, Donald Trump and Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19. This was considered by many to be an October surprise, with The Christian Science Monitor describing it as \\"perhaps the most jarring October surprise in history\\". This positive diagnosis was a part of a larger outbreak that occurred in the White House in October 2020, and has been traced back to the fast-tracked ceremony to announce Amy Coney Barrett as the successor to Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court seat. The event has been described by top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci as a \\"super spreader\\" which has reportedly infected over 30 people including senior White House officials. On October 13, a probe into an Obama-era unmasking request of US civilian names found within National Security Agency foreign Intelligence reports relating to members of Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign, tasked by US Attorney General William Barr, quietly concluded with no findings of wrongdoing. President Trump has claimed that this unmasking request was an act of espionage since the beginning of his presidency and has been emphatically hyping the probe as an ‚ÄúOctober Surprise‚Äù for the 2020 election. It was also revealed that unmasking requests have significantly increased under the Trump presidency according to statistical transparency reports by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. On October 14, the New York Post published an article with purported emails suggesting that Hunter Biden provided an \\"opportunity\\" for a top Ukrainian executive at the Burisma Holdings natural gas firm to meet with his father, Joe Biden. Joe has since denied that the meeting took place. The emails were allegedly found on a water damaged MacBook Pro at a Delaware computer repair shop. The article was met with skepticism, with questions about the authenticity and provenance of the emails. One expert said the story appears to be \\"a standard tactic in disinformation operations.\\" Twitter and Facebook took steps to limit readership of the New York Post article, one of the rare occasions they have sanctioned a traditional media outlet. Twitter allowed the story to rise to the number three trending topic in the U.S., although later marked the link as \\"potentially unsafe\\" and blocked it. It also temporarily locked White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany‚Äôs account, as well as the New York Posts, adding notices to their tweets saying they violated Twitter‚Äôs rules on prohibiting publishing hacked materials. Trump's campaign account was also temporarily locked. In response to this incident, CEO Jack Dorsey apologized in a tweet, saying that the blocking of links without any context to be an unacceptable practice on the platform. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee moved to subpoena Dorsey. Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and several Republican senators have said that the committee will vote on sending the subpoena on October 20 and plan to have Dorsey in front of the committee by October 23. President Trump has since denounced the social media sites for press censorship despite criticisms that he personally utilized the social media platforms to spread disinformation to the public.

Early career He attended Princeton University (Class of 1910).David Lawrence Papers, Princeton University Library. While there, he was a student of Woodrow Wilson. In 1916, he became the Washington correspondent of the New York Evening Post. After his re-election as U.S. President, President Woodrow Wilson fired Irish- American White House secretary (chief of staff) Joseph Patrick Tumulty in 1916 to placate anti-Catholic sentiment, particularly from his wife and his advisor, Colonel Edward M. House. Then, Lawrence successfully interceded on Tumulty's behalf to remain. Political views During the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, David Lawrence criticised the New Deal in his 1934 book Beyond the New Deal.David Lawrence (1934), Beyond the New Deal, New York: McGraw, Hill. His observation of economic activity led him to distinguish between free enterprise and corporatism, and he wrote, \\"Theoretically, corporations are creations of the state.\\" He sharply criticised the use of the atomic bomb against Japan, comparing it to the gas chambers of Nazi concentration camps, and he maintained that the United States had become guilty and needed to apologize to the world.'America's Reaction to the Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki' by Diana Steele Publisher In 1926, Lawrence founded United States Daily, a weekly newspaper devoted to covering government. Seven years later, he shut it down to start United States News for an audience of community leaders, businessmen, and politicians.David Lawrence: A Profile In 1948, United States News merged with Lawrence's two-year-old weekly magazine, World Report, to form the news magazine U.S. News & World Report. At the time of his death, the magazine had a circulation of two million. On April 22, 1970, David Lawrence was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. He died of an apparent heart attack at his Sarasota, Florida, home. Personal life Lawrence married Ellanor (Campbell Hayes Daly) Lawrence on July 17, 1918, and they had three children, David Jr., Mark, Nancy. Etienne was a daughter from a previous marriage. Ellanor died June 13, 1969. To honor her memory, in 1971 David Lawrence gave Fairfax County, Virginia, the land that became Ellanor C. Lawrence Park in Chantilly.

Gen. William \\"Bull\\" Nelson received orders to organize a new brigade at Maysville, Kentucky and conduct an expedition into the Big Sandy Valley region of Eastern Kentucky and stop the build-up of Confederate forces under Col. John S. Williams. This was done in three phases. From September 21 to October 20, 1861, Nelson assembled a brigade of 5,500 Union volunteers from Ohio and Kentucky. On October 23, the southern prong secured Hazel Green and the northern prong West Liberty. The two prongs were consolidated at Salyersville (Licking Station) and they began the final phase on October 31. This led to the Battle of Ivy Mountain on November 8 and the withdrawal of Confederate forces from Pikeville (Piketon) on November 9, 1861. Background During the first week of September 1861, all pretense of neutrality in Kentucky ended when Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk ordered Brig. Gen. Gideon Pillow advance Confederate troops up to Hickman, Kentucky. On September 18, Kentucky legislature approved the introduction of Federal troops from outside the state, the pro-Confederate legislators staying away. The next day, Simon Bolivar Buckner, former commander of the Kentucky State Guard, established a Confederate headquarters at Bowling Green, Kentucky, while troops under Felix K. Zollicoffer seized Barbourville. Shortly afterwards, Zollicoffer arrived at Cumberland Ford with approximately 3,200 men, consisting of four infantry regiments, a field battery of six guns, and four cavalry companies. This posed an imminent threat to Union control of central Kentucky, at a time when increasing numbers of Confederates in the Big Sandy Valley of eastern Kentucky appeared about to enter the Bluegrass region through McCormack's Gap (Frenchburg). In response, Brig. Gen. George H. Thomas ordered troops from Camp Dick Robinson to southeast Kentucky to halt any movement toward Big Hill, Richmond and Lexington. Former Vice President of the United States John C. Breckinridge and his ally, Col. Humphrey Marshall, added to Thomas's concerns with a call for \\"Peace Men\\" and \\"States' Rights Men\\" to assemble in Lexington for drill. However, both Breckinridge and Marshall instead rode to Mt. Sterling to join the Confederate forces in western Virginia, where Marshall took command of the Army of Eastern Kentucky posted at Piketon (Pikeville). Several days later, \\"Bull\\" Nelson publicly announced he had established his headquarters at Camp Kenton near Washington, Kentucky and would arm and equip volunteers \\"to end treason\\" in Kentucky. The Philadelphia Press wrote that the Big Sandy expedition would prevent the Confederates from taking control of the mouth of the Big Sandy River, where it entered the Ohio River. This would protect the rear and right flank of Brig. Gen. William S. Rosecrans in western Virginia, allowing Nelson to reinforce Wildcat Mountain and to push Zollicoffer back to Knoxville. Nelson made Olympia[n] Springs (Mud Lick Springs) in Bath County the staging area. He named it Camp Gill on honor of Harrison Gill, owner of the renowned spa eight miles south of Owingsville and twenty miles east of Mount Sterling. The Mt. Sterling-Pound Gap Road (Rt. 460) ran through McCormick's Gap (Frenchburg), the gateway to the Bluegrass Region from Prestonsburg. On September 29, 1861, Maj. John Smith Hurt occupied the vital mountain pass with three militia companies. Col. Lewis Braxton Grigsby added his 300 men to Hurt's 200 on October 8. Col. James Perry Fyffe had the 59th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment march to Camp Kenton, and Col. Leonard A. Harris arrived in Olympian Springs with the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Col. Jesse S. Norton came forward from Nicholasville with the 21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and during the next two weeks, Nelson's forces grew to about 5,500 men, 3,700 from Ohio and 1,800 from Kentucky. At a farm near Prestonsburg, Confederate captains Andrew Jackson May and John Ficklin assisted \\"Cerro Gordo\\" John S. Williams with the organization the 5th Kentucky Infantry. The 1,010-man unit was badly clothed some called the hard-nosed group the \\"Ragamuffin Regiment.\\" The nine companies of infantry and five mounted companies had two pieces of artillery and they carried an assortment of personal weapons that were ill-suited for warfare. West Liberty and Hazel Green On Monday, October 21, 1861, troops that Nelson had assembled Camp Dick Robinson became engaged in a protracted fight with Zollicoffer's Confederates along the Wilderness Road at Wildcat Mountain. The next morning Nelson was unaware of this when he ordered 1,600 men under Col. Leonard Harris to advance to West Liberty with two artillery pieces. At dawn Wednesday, Nelson was in front of Hazel Green with about 3,500 men and artillery. Thirty- eight of the 200 Confederates surrendered after a brief fight. Twelve miles (19 km) north at West Liberty 500-700 Confederates suffered a loss of 21 dead, 40 wounded, and 34 captured. The Federal loss was two wounded. While Nelson waited for his wagon trains to catch up, he consolidated his forces at Licking Station (Salyersville). The operation resumed on October 31 and on reaching Prestonsburg they found the supposed \\"Gibraltar of Eastern Kentucky\\" abandoned. Ivy Mountain Thursday, November 7, Col. Joshua W. Sill started the northern prong of the Big Sandy expedition toward John's Creek. From there he was to veer south for about forty miles and gain the rear of the enemy at Pikeville. The following morning, Nelson took the main column of 3,600 men toward Pikeville on the Old State Road (Rt. 460). Heavy rain fell in torrents as they neared Ivy Mountain, a hogback, hill about long. The West Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River restricted movement on the right the seven-foot wide path and knee-deep mud forced the artillery to unlimber their guns and rig them so they could follow the infantry forward in a single file. About west of Pikeville, the advance guard disappeared in the elbow of the path as it turned down toward the crossing at Ivy Creek. Directly to their front, there were 250 Confederates some up the hill and hidden behind rocks, trees, and bushes. About 1:00 p.m., that hillside exploded with blue smoke from the doubled- barreled shotguns and old muskets carried by the Confederates. In the next instant, four Union soldiers were dead and another 13 lay on the ground wounded. Nelson rushed forward with his saber drawn, climbed up on a conspicuously located rock, and told his men \\"that if the Rebels could not hit him they could not hit any of them.\\" He ordered the 2nd Ohio Infantry and 21st Ohio Infantry to push up side of the mountain and flank the enemy position from the north. At the same, Nelson had two light artillery pieces take a position near mouth of Ivy Creek and West Levisa Fork and fire directly into the enemy breastworks. About 2:20 p.m., the 21st Ohio Infantry arrived at the top of hill. The rolled large boulders down on the Confederates who ran off in every direction. One half-hour later, Captain May had his men felling trees and burning bridges to retard pursuit. The Battle of Ivy Mountain (Ivy Narrows) was a clear victory for the Union force under Nelson who had gained full control of the field at a loss of six killed and 24 wounded. The opposing Confederates had 10 dead, 15 wounded, and 50 missing or taken prisoner. Nelson ended the pursuit beyond a burned bridge at Coldwater Creek and near the home of Unionist Lindsay Layne. Williams continued on to Pikeville where he posted a rear guard of 400 men to cover a withdrawal to Pound Gap with the remainder of his force. At 3:00 a.m. Saturday, November 9, Nelson had his troops back in pursuit. Terrible road conditions retarded movement and by nightfall, he remained from Pikeville. Early Sunday, November 10, Nelson had come to within several miles of the objective when a detachment from Joshua Sill's northern prong rode forward to advise they had secured the town at 4:00 p.m. Saturday. In Pound Gap, Colonel Williams reported that Nelson had dispersed an \\"unorganized and half-armed, barefooted squad\\" that lacked everything, but the will to fight. The Cincinnati Commercial noted that Nelson had shown how \\"troops could be moved across unforgiving terrain without adequate transportation.\\" That determination had truly surprised Williams who believed that Nelson would continue into Virginia with the intent of destroying the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad, a line that connected the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia with the Memphis, Tennessee and the Mississippi Valley at Knoxville. In the first accounts of the fighting at Ivy Mountain, Northern news correspondents grossly misrepresented events because their Northern audience wanted a quick conclusion to the war. Those mistakes led the Cincinnati Gazette to conclude that while a great victory had been attained, the \\"campaign in Eastern Kentucky has no more permanent effect than the passage of a showman's caravan. Five hundred rebel guerrilla cavalry will undo in a week the ornamental work . . . done at so great an expenditure of money and of most precious time.\\" The latter issues were of great concern and the reason why Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell replaced Brig. Gen. William T. Sherman in Louisville. Nelson received orders to report there and his brigade followed on Sunday afternoon, November 24. As predicted, the Confederates returned and that brought Col. James A. Garfield into the region to resume the unfinished task of subduing them.

It was released October 25, 1999 on Mr. Lady Records. The album combined pop music with the band's feminist political lyrics. It received positive reviews from music critics. History Fateman, Samson, and Hanna performing in September 2000 Le Tigre was formed by Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, and Sadie Benning. Hanna lived with Fateman while the two were in a band called the Troublemakers. Hanna had collaborated with Benning on a video for \\"Aerobicide\\" from Hannah's 1997 album Julie Ruin. The three of them originally planned to come up with a live format for Hanna's songs as Julie Ruin, but they transitioned into making music. The band constructed songs using inexpensive electronic equipment. Fateman explained that they chose equipment with which they were unfamiliar to show \\"girl-punk scorn for that particular strain of male expertise associated with electronic music.\\" Le Tigre produced the album with Chris Stamey of the dB's, who helped the band rearrange songs through digital editing. Hanna and Fateman knew the founders of Mr. Lady Records from their time in Portland, Oregon. They chose to release the album through Mr. Lady because of its political engagement. When Benning was unable to tour in support of the album, the band removed them from its lineup and added JD Samson. Composition Le Tigres music spans 1960s pop, punk rock, and lo-fi new wave. The band members listened to pop and hip hop music while making it. Le Tigre plays Farfisa organs, samplers, turntables, and guitars on the album. Many of the album's beats were programmed on an Alesis HR-16b drum machine. Fateman stated that she found the use of a drum machine liberating because \\"it makes you self-sufficient.\\" Sadie Benning, one of the original band members and collaborators. The album incorporates the band's political beliefs; Hanna commented that she wanted \\"to make something that's totally pleasurable and political too.\\" \\"My My Metrocard\\" criticizes New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, and \\"Hot Topic\\" praises progressive activists. The band emphasized frankness and didacticism in its lyrics as a response to the ironic tone of hipster subculture. Le Tigre's vocals often carry a bored or soft-spoken tone, punctuated by more energetic bursts. Their use of girl group chants was likened to 1960s group the Shangri-Las. Hanna was influenced by the vocals on old records by Lesley Gore, the Shirelles, and Connie Francis. She explained that she was fascinated by \\"what it would be like to be a woman with way more constraints than we have now, singing these really fucked-up insipid heterosexual love songs.\\" Critical reception Le Tigre received positive reviews from music critics. The Village Voice writer Robert Christgau wrote that \\"Hanna does the unprecedented‚Äîif not, apparently, impossible‚Äîand reinvents punk again.\\" AllMusic described Le Tigre as sounding \\"like the best new wave album not to come from the 1980s.\\" Pitchfork called the album's songwriting \\"less didactic than Bikini Kill's ... geared for the repeated listens these well-crafted pop songs beg for.\\" Spin said that the album \\"sparkles with a joie de vivre more bubbly than a pink champagne\\" and continued that \\"the sound is as charming as the stories they tell\\", and the magazine later named it the 10th best album of 2000. PopMatters described Le Tigre as \\"a record in which bristling punk-pop tunes target listeners with confrontational, thought-provoking messages.\\" Select referred to the album as \\"12 sparky pop nuggets\\" and \\"a righteous gem and one worthy of attention of even the most demanding devotee of big shiny production.\\" Le Tigre placed 28th on The Village Voices 2000 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. The album is listed in the reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Songs = Deceptacon = Opening track \\"Deceptacon\\" references Barry Mann's 1961 single \\"Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)\\" by asking \\"Who took the Bomp from the Bompalompalomp?\\". It denounces a decline in meaningful lyrics in rock music. Hanna expressed frustration that riot grrrl had been transformed into icons like the Spice Girls. The song was popularized by online videos of its \\"aerobicon\\" choreography. \\"Deceptacon\\" was featured in the 2006 Norwegian film Reprise, the 2003 skateboarding film Yeah Right!, the 2015 documentary film Hurricane of Fun: The Making of Wet Hot, the 2014 animated film The Book of Life, a Pandora Radio advertisement featuring British virtual band Gorillaz, the fourth episode of the Netflix series Special and the trailer for the 2019 film Between Two Ferns: The Movie. The song sparked a collaboration between Le Tigre and Christina Aguilera. = Hot Topic = \\"Hot Topic\\" was released as the album's only single. It is a list song of people whose work inspired the band. Most are female, and many are also LGBT. The song encourages them to continue on behalf of progressive women. It combines the sounds of doo-wop, Japanese indie pop, and new wave. Hanna described \\"Hot Topic\\" as analogous to a college syllabus in its ability to pass on awareness of works to others. The song was used in a Kohl's commercial in 2016. = What's Yr Take on Cassavetes = \\"What's Yr Take on Cassavetes\\" uses American filmmaker John Cassavetes to depict the conflict between public figures' work and their personal lives. It opens with a solemn spoken passage asking \\"how you really feel about it\\". The song breaks down into a shouting match that labels Cassavetes with positive terms such as \\"genius\\" and \\"messiah\\" as well as negative ones such as \\"misogynist\\" and \\"alcoholic\\". = My My Metrocard = \\"My My Metrocard\\" is a go-go song about escapism and exploration. It uses a call-and-response pattern to condemn then-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose policies against quality- of-life crimes the band opposed. Track listing =Track list error on reissue= The first two bonus tracks listed on the back cover of the reissue have \\"Hot Topic\\" then \\"Deceptacon\\". These songs are listed in the wrong order, as the song \\"Deceptacon\\" is on track 13, and \\"Hot Topic\\" is on track 14. This information is matched by the CDDB, but was fixed in the iTunes Store.

He began his career as a child in David Warfield's production of The Return of Peter Grimm. Among his early credits were roles in films directed by D.W. Griffith. Grauer was born in Staten Island, New York. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School, he received his B.A. from the City College of New York in 1930. Grauer started in radio as an actor but soon became part of the broadcasting staff at the National Broadcasting Company. He was one of the four narrators, along with Burgess Meredith, of NBC's public affairs series The Big Story, which focused on courageous journalists. In 1954, he married interior designer Melanie Kahane. Radio Grauer's greatest fame lies in his legendary 40-year career in radio. In 1930, the 22-year-old Benjamin Franklin Grauer joined the staff at NBC. He quickly rose through the ranks to become a senior commentator and reporter. He was the designated announcer for the popular 1940s Walter Winchell's Jergens Journal. Perhaps, most importantly, he was selected by Arturo Toscanini to become the voice of the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Grauer took over as announcer in late 1942, and remained until the orchestra was disbanded in June 1954. Toscanini said he was his favorite announcer. Grauer did both the Toscanini radio and TV broadcasts. Several years after the death of Toscanini, Grauer and composer Don Gillis (who produced the NBC programs from 1947 to 1954), created the Peabody Award- winning radio series Toscanini, the Man Behind the Legend. It began in 1963 and continued through the centennial of Toscanini's birth in 1967. This series ran for nearly two decades on NBC Radio and then other radio stations until the early 1980s. Starting in 1932, Grauer covered the Olympic Games, presidential inaugurations and international events. During his radio career, Grauer covered nearly every major historic event, including the Morro Castle fire, the Paris Peace Conference and the US occupation of Japan. Millions remember his NBC coverage of the New Year's celebrations on both radio and TV. Between 1951 and 1969, Grauer covered these events 11 times live from New York's Times Square. He continued covering New Year's Eve for Guy Lombardo's New Year's Eve specials on CBS in the 1970s, with his last appearance on December 31, 1976, the year before both he and Lombardo died. From the mid-1950s until the mid-1960s, Grauer's reports were part of the NBC television network's The Tonight Show, where he worked with Johnny Carson and prior to that, Jack Paar, and Steve Allen. Grauer was also one of NBC Radio's Monitor \\"Communicators\\" from 1955 to 1960. Grauer also was one of five hosts/narrators of \\"The First Fabulous Fifty\\", a five-part NBC Radio Network documentary series on the history of the network, featuring soundbites from past NBC programs. The series was broadcast on the occasion of the network's 50th anniversary in the autumn of 1976. Grauer narrated the first installment, which covered the network's first decade on the air, 1926 through 1936. Television Grauer as the host of WNBT-TV's (later WNBC-TV) tenth anniversary special. Grauer provided the commentary for NBC's first television special, the opening in 1939 of the New York World's Fair. In 1948, Grauer, working with anchor John Cameron Swayze, provided the first extensive live network TV coverage of the national political conventions. For five months in 1950, Grauer was host of The Ben Grauer Show, an NBC talk show that focused on books and their authors. In 1954, NBC began broadcasting some of their shows in living color, and in 1957, the animated Peacock logo made its debut. It was Grauer who first spoke the now famous words, \\"The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC\\", behind the Peacock graphic. During his 40-year broadcast career, he hosted numerous TV programs on NBC, including game shows, quiz shows, concerts and news programs. Reissues It is for announcing the Toscanini radio concerts that Grauer is best known to modern classical music buffs. Several CD reissues have included those announcements to give the listener the feeling of hearing the NBC Symphony broadcasts exactly as they sounded when first aired. However, on the videocassettes and DVD's of Toscanini's television concerts, Grauer's voice has been replaced by that of Martin Bookspan. This was done because the music tracks now heard are not taken from the actual 1948-52 television audio, which was very inferior, but from live, hi-fi magnetic tape sound recordings made of these same concerts at the studio. They are exactly synchronized to the visual images so that it now appears that these programs were made with high-fidelity sound. In order to maintain a complete illusion of superior sound, the announcements had to be redone; the difference in audio quality between Grauer's announcements and the music tracks as they are now heard would have been blatantly obvious. An archival recording of Grauer's voice calling, \\"Here it is,\\" begins Harry Shearer's Le Show. Final years and death In the decade before his death, Grauer collected material for a projected history of prices and pricing, with special attention to book prices. He was active in several professional journalistic organizations as well as the Grolier Club. Grauer had a strong interest in the graphic arts; he even printed his own Christmas cards. The headstone of Ben Grauer in Westchester Hills CemeteryThe grave marker of Ben GrauerBen Grauer died of a heart attack at New York University Medical Center in New York City on May 31, 1977, two days before his 69th birthday. He is interred in Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

Congress enacted HMDA in 1975.Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 Purposes HMDA grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods. Congress believed that some financial institutions had contributed to the decline of some geographic areas by their failure to provide adequate home financing to qualified applicants on reasonable terms and conditions. Thus, one purpose of HMDA and Regulation C is to provide the public with information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. A second purpose is to aid public officials in targeting public investments from the private sector to areas where they are needed. Finally, the FIRREA amendments of 1989 require the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics to assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing antidiscrimination statutes.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Supervision and Exam Manual As the name implies, HMDA is a disclosure law that relies upon public scrutiny for its effectiveness. It does not prohibit any specific activity of lenders, and it does not establish a quota system of mortgage loans to be made in any Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or other geographic area as defined by the Office of Management and Budget.Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Supervision and Exam Manual Who reports HMDA data? US financial institutions must report HMDA data to their regulator if they meet certain criteria, such as having assets above a specific threshold. The criteria is different for depository and non-depository institutions and are available on the FFIEC website.Reporting Criteria In 2012, there were 7,400 institutions that reported a total of 18.7 million HMDA records.FFIEC Press Release Details of the law Companies covered under HMDA are required to keep a Loan Application Register (LAR). Each time someone applies for a home mortgage at an institution covered by HMDA, the company is required to make a corresponding entry into the LAR, noting the following information. * The date of application * The loan type (conventional loan, FHA loan, VA loan or a loan guaranteed by the Farmers Home Administration) * The type of property involved (single-family, multifamily) * The purpose of the loan (home purchase, home improvement, refinancing) * Owner occupancy of the property (owner occupied or non-owner occupied) * The loan amount * Whether or not the application was a request for pre-approval * The type of action taken (approved, denied, withdrawn, etc.) * The date of action taken * The location (state, county, MSA and census tract) of the property * The ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) of the borrower(s) * The race of the borrower(s) * The gender of the borrower(s) * The gross annual income of the borrower(s) * If the loan was subsequently sold in the secondary market, the type of entity that purchased it * If the loan was denied, the reason why it was denied (this field is optional for entities not regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) * Rate Spread (Rate spread is a metric that assists in reporting if the rate given to the borrower is above a certain threshold of the prevailing rates at the time of the application) * If the loan is or is not subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 * Lien status of the loan (1st or 2nd lien) For data from years prior to 2017 reporting institutions were required to submit their LARs by March 1 to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), an interagency body empowered to administer HMDA. Pursuant to the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as of 2018 HMDA data was to be submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau via online portal. The first year of data to be submitted via this process includes loans made in 2017. The Dodd- Frank bill also required several new and formerly non-public items be collected and released as a part of the HMDA dataset. Beginning with January 2018 lenders are required to report the following items that were formerly non-public information: * Credit score; * NMLS Identification of the loan originator; * Loan channel; * Borrower age; * Combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio; * Borrower's debt-to-income (DTI) ratio; * Borrower-paid origination charges; * Points and fees; * Discount points; * Lender credits; * Loan term; * Prepayment penalties; * Non-amortizing loan features; * Interest rate; and * Rate spread for all loans. The new requirements also require the collection of disaggregated data on Asian borrowers, identifying their ethnic origins with more precision. HMDA data can be used to identify probable housing discrimination in various ways. It is important to understand that in all cases of possible discrimination, the basic regulatory inquiry revolves around whether a protected class of persons being denied a loan or offered different terms for reasons other than objectively acceptable characteristics (e.g. income, collateral). * If an institution turns down a disproportionate percentage of applications by certain races (e.g. African Americans), ethnicities (e.g. Hispanics), or genders (typically women), then there is reason to suspect that the institution may be discriminating against these classes of borrowers by unfairly denying them credit. Such discrimination is illegal in the United States. Although well-documented during the period of local bank dominance in American history, the rise of mass financial institutions since the early 1990s has led to increasing investor scrutiny regarding profits, and hence a lower likelihood that a bank can afford to subsidize such outright discrimination by forgoing loan originations. Yet several recent studies using HMDA data still detect racial and ethnic disparities in lending activity, even when factors such as income are accounted for statistically. * If an institution has a disproportionately low percentage of applications by certain races (e.g. African Americans), ethnicities (e.g. Hispanics) or genders (typically women) then there is reason to suspect that the institution may be discriminating against these classes of borrowers by unfairly discouraging them from applying for mortgage loans. Such discrimination is illegal in the United States. However, there is tension in this arena between attempts by banks to attract high quality borrowers and the extent to which borrower quality corresponds with a protected status. This type of monitoring, however, has been particularly effective as reducing implicit or referral based discrimination, where a discriminatory body, e.g. a local sporting club who quietly favors an all-white membership, is relied upon to recommend applicants. Banks are now wary of entering such relationships, insofar as they expose the lender to the liability associated with the discriminatory behavior of the partner organization. * If an institution has a disproportionately low percentage of applications from certain areas, compared to areas immediately surrounding the area in question, then there is reason to suspect that the institution is engaging in redlining. However, note that few banks are found to be in violation of redlining clauses, as many pricing or approval models that are deemed legally valid are driven by factors with the implicit effect of redlining geographic areas if these areas contain a disproportionate number of poorly qualified borrowers. Rather, redlining must be quite overt to draw attention (e.g. using zip codes as a lending criterion). * If there is a disproportionate prevalence of high-interest loans to certain classes of borrowers (e.g., Hispanics or women), other attributes equal, then there is a reason to suspect that the institution is engaging in price based discrimination. This is the most active area of compliance monitoring with respect to HMDA data, since risk management policies at many financial institutions are quick to identify outright discrimination by lending officers (i.e. denials based on a protected category). Simultaneously, this area is the rifest for contention with respect to discriminatory claims, since there are market driven reasons for charging a higher rate that may exhibit discriminatory patterns. For example, a loan officer may query applicants to see if they have applied and been approved for a loan at any other banks. The rate for those that can produce another institution's offer may then be adjusted accordingly to remain competitive. However, if a certain ethnic group is less likely to \\"shop around\\" for the best rate, then the mere application of this principle ‚Äî which is otherwise non-discriminatory in intent ‚Äî can produce discriminatory effects. Many disputes between lenders and regulators in the context of price discrimination relate to such scenarios. Again, the key litmus test is whether the objective characteristic being used to lower or raise the mortgage rate for a given group is substantive in its own right with respect to the risk or profitability of the potential loan, rather than mere a proxy for racial discrimination.

She was the third wife of Liu Cong (Emperor Zhaowu). Life Liu E was the daughter of one of Liu Cong's honored officials, Liu Yin (ÂäâÊÆ∑), who was described as someone who was willing to point out Liu Cong's faults, but only doing so in private, thus earning the temperamental and impulsive emperor's respect. She was initially taken as a concubine by him in 312, along with her sister Liu Ying (ÂäâËã±) and four of her nieces. This move was opposed by Liu Cong's brother and crown prince Liu Ai (Âäâ‰πÇ), who argued it would be a violation of the prohibition against endogamy. Liu Cong, however, rationalized the move in that Liu Yin was ethnically Han, while he himself was ethnically Xiongnu, and therefore were not of the same ancestor. Liu E and her sister Liu Ying were both favored by Liu Cong. Initially, in 312, Liu Cong wanted to appoint Liu Ying empress to replace Empress Huyan, who had died earlier that year, but at his mother Empress Dowager Zhang's insistence, he appointed another concubine, Zhang Huiguang empress instead. Liu Ying died soon thereafter. In 313, Empress Zhang died. Liu Cong appointed Liu E empress and wanted to build a palace for her. His minister Chen Yuanda (Èô≥ÂÖÉÈÅî) tried to persuade him that it was overly wasteful, and Liu Cong, in anger, ordered Chen's execution. However, the new empress interceded, and Chen was spared and further promoted. For the next year, under Empress Liu's and Chen's advice, Liu Cong was said to have corrected his behavior to some extent. Empress Liu herself was described as intelligent and kind. However, she died in 314. It was said that from that point on, Liu Cong's palace would be thoroughly in a confused state, and Liu Cong's own personal behavior appeared to degenerate after this, without her counsel.

It is the oldest operating trolley museum in the United States. It was founded to preserve the heritage of the trolley car. The museum includes exhibits on trolley history in the visitors' center and offers rides on restored trolleys along its track. The ride includes a tour of the museum's historic trolley collection. The museum encompasses the Branford Electric Railway Historic District, which was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The museum was incorporated in August 1945 as the Branford Electric Railway Association (BERA), a non-profit historical and educational institution. The Connecticut Company (or ConnCo), which operated most of the streetcar lines in the state of Connecticut, had been making plans since the early 1930s to abandon its \\"F\\" route, cutting it back in stages from its long-time terminus of Stony Creek until by April 1946 it ended in front of the post office in Short Beach, its original terminus when the line was opened for service on 31 July 1900. The last revenue car to operate under ConnCo auspices left Short Beach shortly after midnight on March 8, 1947, at which time BERA took possession of the remaining portion of the line on private right-of-way between East Haven and Short Beach. Over the following year the museum moved virtually its entire collection at the time, including a number of just-retired ConnCo streetcars, onto its property via the existing and still-electrified track connection with Connecticut Company. After ConnCo severed the track connection in 1948, BERA was on its own. The line started out as double track but one of the tracks was torn up and sold for scrap to raise money. Eventually 20-year bonds were issued by the museum and its fortunes improved. In 1957 an impressive visitor's center, named for traction pioneer Frank Julian Sprague and known as Sprague Station, was built out of brick at the East Haven end of the line with help from funds donated by his widow. Over the intervening years, BERA's collection has grown to become the third largest collection of electric railway equipment in North America, with a focus on equipment from Connecticut and New York City. It operates a variety of streetcars, rapid transit cars and work cars throughout the year. BERA currently does business as the Shore Line Trolley Museum which is run almost entirely by volunteers. Antique equipment is repaired and restored at the museum. Third Avenue Railway System 220, the oldest operating streetcar in the United States The collection also includes a small number of \\"trackless trolleys\\" (trolley buses) and motor buses (diesel- or gasoline-powered buses). In fall 2008, construction was started on a short trolley bus line, to allow the museum's trolley buses to operate. The planned line is a loop about long, with a branch into the maintenance and storage building.Trolleybus Magazine No. 295 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2011), p. 11. National Trolleybus Association (UK). ISSN 0266-7452. The first section was tested under power in April 2009 by 1947-built ACF-Brill trolley bus 205, which the museum acquired from the Philadelphia trolley bus system when it was retired from service by SEPTA in 1981. Construction of the line was about half completed as of September 2010 and due to continue in 2011. Regular operation ‚Äì proposed to take place about once a month ‚Äì is not expected to begin before 2012. The Shore Line Museum also owns two other trolley buses, ex-Philadelphia 210, identical to No. 205 (and acquired at the same time) and being used only as a source of parts, and ex-Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (Boston-area) 4037, a 1976 Flyer E800 which the museum acquired in 2009 and which is also able to operate on the line. The museum The Museum operates seasonally, performing the majority of its programming during the warmer months. A standard public program includes a ride on the Museum's historical railway on a trolley car, and a tour of some of the Museum's collection stored in the car barns. For groups or individuals wishing to visit the museum separate from the general public, charters are available on a year-round basis. Visitors, who enter at the Museum's visitor center at Sprague station, can also explore an exhibit area that discusses some of the history and technology of the trolley. Visitors often frequently hike parts of the historic line for exercise, to explore, or for photograph opportunities. The Museum allows guests to take the controls and operate some of the vehicles in the collection on specified \\"Guest Operator\\" weekends, after receiving instruction from a qualified instructor. Rapid transit (subway and elevated) equipment is run in conjunction with the trolleys on designated \\"Rapid Transit\\" weekends. Other special events include an antique auto show each year, a Halloween pumpkin patch, a haunted Halloween trolley ride to a haunted trail with the \\"Graveyard Express/Haunted Isle\\", as well as Christmas trolley rides with Santa, and nighttime Holiday Light trolley rides which visit light displays set up along the railway. In addition, the Museum features an annual open house for Members only on \\"Members Day\\" where cars of the collection rarely seen often run. Almost all of the Museum's operational, archival, business, administrative, and maintenance activities are performed by volunteers. The Museum offers the opportunity to volunteer to anyone over 18 years of age who is interested in the following areas: public operations (which includes the ability to learn to operate the trolley cars), car restoration, archives, buildings and grounds, track, line (power), signal, and exhibits.

After the Battle of Sailor's Creek on April 6, 1865, surviving Confederate troops of Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson and Major General John B. Gordon headed for the High Bridge, a double-deck structure with a railroad bridge on top and a lower wagon road bridge over the Appomattox River to cross to the north side of the river and continue their retreat to the west. The Confederates intended to destroy the bridge, which they had fought to save the day before in the Battle of High Bridge, but through mistakes and delays did not start to do so until Union troops of Major General Andrew A. Humpreys's II Corps began to arrive at the bridges. After a second smaller Battle of High Bridge, the Union soldiers at the scene kept the railroad bridge from total destruction and saved the wagon bridge in shape for use. Humphreys's troops pursued the last division in the line of march, the division of Major General William Mahone to Cumberland Church about to the west and north of Farmville, Virginia where the Confederates began to fortify the high ground around the church. Soon, Lieutenant General James Longstreet with the entire remaining Confederate infantry moved up from Farmville, Virginia to join Mahone, burning the railroad and wagon bridges at Farmville after them. The Confederate cavalry and one infantry brigade that were left behind had to ford the river nearby. After some fighting in transit to Cumberland Church in which Brigadier General Thomas A. Smyth was mortally wounded, Humphreys ordered his two divisions, which reached the church soon after Mahone, to attack the Confederate line. Finding the Confederate position too strong to take, Humphreys recalled Brigadier General Francis Barlow's division, which had been heading directly to Farmville in pursuit of Gordon's corps, and sent a message to Army of the Potomac commander Major General George Meade that Lee's whole army was north of the river. Humphreys suggested that reinforcements be sent in order to engage the full Confederate Army. Neither Humphreys nor Meade knew until later that the Confederates had destroyed the bridges at Farmville and no reinforcements could reach Humphreys that afternoon. Mistaking a separate nearby cavalry engagement as the arrival of reinforcements engaging with Lee's infantry, Humphreys ordered another futile attack, which was repulsed by the Confederates. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) John Irvin Gregg was taken prisoner by the Confederates in the cavalry engagement. Since no reinforcements could quickly reach Humphreys and night was approaching, Humphreys ordered no further attacks. The II Corps had at least 571 casualties in the Battle at Cumberland Church and the cavalry had 74 in what is sometimes called the Battle of Farmville. Confederate casualties are unknown but have been estimated to be about half the number of the Union casualties. The National Park Service gives the number of Confederate casualties as 255. Realizing that the Union forces could close in on his men at Cumberland Church, General Robert E. Lee withdrew his army in another night march to the west at about 11:00 p.m. Although the Confederates held back the Union Army at Cumberland Church and had fewer casualties, they were delayed in their march, which helped other Union forces south of the Appomattox River to pass them and cut them off at the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Background =Retreat from Sailor's Creek= Because of the need to reduce steep grades in the vicinity of Farmville, the South Side Railroad crossed from the south side of the [Appomattox River to the north side over the High Bridge east of Farmville, about from Rice's Station.Calkins, Chris. The Appomattox Campaign, March 29 - April 9, 1865. Conshohocken, PA: Combined Books, 1997. . p. 123 From High Bridge, the railroad ran parallel to the north bank of the river until it reached Farmville, Virginia, to the southwest. At Farmville, the railroad crossed back to the south side of the river and proceeded to the west. The railroad bridge at Farmville also had an adjacent wagon bridge.Calkins, 1997, pp. 123-124. After the Battle of Sailor's Creek, Confederate Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson and Major General John B. Gordon and the defeated survivors of their corps headed for the South Side Railroad's High Bridge and the wagon bridge below it to cross to the presumed relative safety of the north side of the Appomattox River.Humphreys, Andrew A., The Virginia Campaign of 1864 and 1865: The Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James. New York: Charles Scribners' Sons, 1883. . Retrieved March 5, 2015. p. 386. After fighting unsuccessfully to destroy the bridges after themselves, Gordon and his men followed the route of the railroad over the High Bridge, along the north bank of the river, and back to the south side of the river over the bridges at Farmville to obtain rations and then immediately return to the north side of the river from Farmville. =Longstreet moves to, evacuates Farmville= Lieutenant General James Longstreet's corps, which had reached Rice's Station on the morning of April 6, had moved past Sailor's Creek because they were at the head of the march and missed the battle there.Calkins, 1997, pp. 99, 105. After the minor Battle of Rice's Station on April 6, in a night march, Longstreet's corps slipped away from Major General John Gibbon's XXIV Corps of Major General Edward Ord's Army of the James, which had approached the Confederate lines at Rice's Station during afternoon.Calkins, 1997, pp. 115-116.Humphreys, 1883, pp. 386-387. Longstreet's corps stayed south of the river and headed west for Farmville during the night. Confederate cavalry had been covering Longstreet's march but after crossing Bush River, Longstreet placed Alfred M. Scales's brigade (under the command of Colonel Joseph H. Hyman) of Major General Cadmus Wilcox's division as the rear guard.Calkins, 1997, pp. 124-125. Longstreet's troops began to arrive at Farmville, under close pursuit by Union Major General George Crook's cavalry division, at about 9:00 a.m.on April 7.Calkins, 1997, p. 124. Gibbon's XXIV Corps of Ord's Army of the James, reinforced by Brigadier General William Birney's second division of the XXV Corps, followed closely behind Crook's cavalry. Rations were promptly issued to Longstreet's men at Farmville but the soldiers were told to march to the north side of the river to begin their meal preparations. When Confederate Commissary General Isaac M. St. John heard gunfire just outside town, he sent the ration trains west on the South Side Railroad to Pamplin's Depot or Pamplin's Station in an effort to prevent their capture.Calkins, 1997, p. 128. Sheridan's cavalry got to Pamplin's Station first and captured 3 engines and the rolling stock with the supplies.Trudeau, 1994, pp. 126-127. The Confederate provost guard and their prisoners were sent down the road without rations.Marvel, 2002. . p. 123. Some rations were passed out to troops on the march out of Farmville and the empty wagons from which they were distributed were burned.Marvel, 2002, p. 122. Longstreet had to move his forces quickly from Farmville to the Cumberland Church vicinity to avoid Union forces closing in the town. =Second Battle of High Bridge= Major General Andrew A. Humphreys began to march the II Corps west from the Sailor's Creek Battlefield at 5:30 a.m. on April 7.Calkins, 1997, p. 125. When the leading unit of the Second Division of the II Corps under the command of Brigadier General Francis C. Barlow reached High Bridge at about 7:00 a.m., they found that the Confederates had blown up the redoubt at the bridgehead on the northern (and western) side of the bridge and were just starting to burn the railroad bridge and lower wagon and foot bridge.Humphreys, 1883, p. 387.Marvel, 2002, p. 121. A mistaken or misunderstood order to Lieutenant General Anderson's guards not to allow anyone to pass kept Major General William Mahone's division from crossing until the order were clarified.Anderson said that he issued the order because General Lee had ordered him to collect all stragglers. Calkins, 1997, p. 125. Then more time was spent getting the required order to destroy the bridges to the Confederate engineers commanded by Colonel Thomas M. R. Talcott.Marvel, 2002, p. 121 states that Mahone, as commander of the rear guard, should have given the order. Mahone later tried to pass the responsibility for the delayed order to Gordon or even to say that he asked Lee to give the order directly to Talcott. Talcott stated that Mahone should have given the order and that he had to send his second-in-command looking for orders to destroy the bridge and found Mahone down the road from the bridge.Calkins, 1997, pp. 125-126. This permitted the lead units of the II Corps to reach the bridge just as the Confederates were attempting to destroy it.Starr, Steven. The Union Cavalry in the Civil War: The War in the East from Gettysburg to Appomattox, 1863-1865\\\\. Volume 2. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2007. Originally published 1981. . p. 475. The ensuing fight to save or destroy the bridges was the second Battle of High Bridge, following the battle the previous day when a Union raiding force tried to destroy the bridge to keep the Confederates on the south side of the Appomattox River and the Confederates successfully fought to save it, killing or capturing the Union force. On the morning of April 7, the Union troops led by the 19th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment under Colonel Isaac R. Starbird were able to prevent the total destruction of the railroad bridge, though it had been made unusable.Calkins, 1997, pp. 126-127. They were able to preserve the wagon bridge for passage of the II Corps in their pursuit of Gordon, Anderson and Mahone.Longacre, Edward G. The Cavalry at Appomattox: A Tactical Study of Mounted Operations During the Civil War's Climactic Campaign, March 27 ‚Äì April 9, 1865. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2003. . p. 160. Colonel William A. Olmsted's First Brigade of Barlow's division and Brigadier General Thomas Alfred Smyth's Third Brigade, joined by Brigadier General Nelson Miles's division drove off a counterattack by Mahone's troops who were trying to complete the bridges' destruction.Calkins, 1997, pp. 127-128. Mahone's division was in a defensive line with two redoubts on high ground on the north bank of the river when the II Corps began to arrive at the bridges but they moved to northwest when they could not destroy the bridges and prevent Humphreys's corps from crossing the river. Gordon's corps moved up river along the railroad bed toward Farmville. Humphreys, with Miles's and Brigadier General Regis de Trobriand's divisions, followed Mahone while Barlow's division followed Gordon.Humphreys, 1883, p. 388. =Pursuit; Smyth mortally wounded= Gordon's corps and Barlow's division skirmished from High Bridge to the northern outskirts of Farmville. An advance Union party of 103 men from the 7th Michigan Infantry Regiment and the 59th New York Infantry Regiment were taken prisoner by the 9th (1st) North Carolina Battalion of Sharp Shooters of Brigadier General John A. Walker's division. Barlow's division caught up with part of Gordon's division and cut off and burned 135 wagons along the road. During this attack, Brigadier General Smyth was mortally wounded by a sniper shot as he rode with his skirmish line within of Gordon's rear guard near Farmville.Trudeau, Noah Andre. Out of the Storm: The End of the Civil War, April-June 1865. Boston, New York: Little, Brown and Company, 1994. . p. 122. Colonel Daniel Woodall of the 1st Delaware Infantry Regiment assumed command of the Third Brigade. Smyth's men were stunned by his fall and refused to move for several minutes as Gordon's men began to withdraw.Marvel, 2002, p. 126. Colonel William A. Olmsted's brigade moved to support Smyth's brigade but about 100 of his men were captured as Confederate rear guards rushed Smyth's hesitating troops. Barlow's men ceased the pursuit altogether as they reached the vicinity of the edge of Farmville north of the river. =Union troops take Farmville; Confederates withdraw north= While the VI Corps pursued Mahone's division and Gordon's corps north of the Appomattox River, Ord and Gibbons with the XXIV Corps and a brigade of cavalry from Crook's division engaged with Longstreet's rear guard, Scales's brigade and the cavalry, at Briery Creek, just short of Bush River.Marvel, 2002, p. 124. During this encounter, the other men of Cadmus Wilcox's division received rations at Farmville and moved to the north side of the river. The 1st Maine Cavalry Regiment, armed with 16-shot Henry repeating rifles, led the attack on the Confederate rear guard and the Union forces drove them toward Farmville.Marvel, 2002, p. 125. Wilcox led his division back across the river to protect the rear guard and the trains with rations just before they moved out toward Pamplin Station. Wilcox then took his men back to the north side of the river cross and Alexander's men started to burn the bridge. Since the Confederates burned the bridge before all their troops were across, Major General Thomas L. Rosser's and Colonel Thomas T. Munford's cavalry divisions and Brigadier General John Bratton's infantry brigade had to cross the river further upstream under fire from Crook's lead units.Calkins, 1997. p. 129. Crook's cavalry came into town and captured stragglers while the XXIV Corps was only away when the bridge was burned. By the time the main body of Crook's cavalry reached Farmville, most of the Confederates had crossed to the north side of the Appomattox River and burned the bridges leading from the main part of town to the north side of the river.Marvel, 2002, p. 125 states that a \\"fringe of Farmville ... lay north of the river\\". The cavalry ford that Crook's men soon discovered was too deep for the infantry to cross. By 1:30 p.m., Union troops of the Army of the James and Major General Horatio Wright's VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac occupied Farmville while Crook's cavalry found a spot just northwest of town to ford the Appomattox River.Longacre, 2003, p. 163. Soon thereafter, Union Army General-in-Chief Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and his staff arrived in Farmville, making the Randolph House (Prince Edward Hotel) his headquarters. When all of the Confederates crossed the river from Farmville, they formed a line of battle on Cumberland Heights overlooking the town. Artillery was set up to fire on the Union troops as they moved into Farmville. After a short period of time, the Confederates withdrew to the north to join Mahone's division around Cumberland Church. At this location, First Corps (Longstreet's) artillery chief Edward Porter Alexander told General Lee that the route of march to Appomattox Station was shorter on the south side of the river and they should have stayed there.Lee did not respond immediately but asked Alexander to check the mileage with local troops. When Alexander confirmed the information, Lee said: \\"Well there is time enough to think about that. Go and attend to these matters.\\" (Lee was referring to the destruction of the bridges at Farmville.) Alexander later wrote: \\"Indeed, no man who looked at our situation on a map, or who understood the geography of the country, could fail to see that General Grant had us completely in a trap. ... We were now in a sort of jug shaped peninsula between the James River and Appomattox and there was but one outlet, the neck of the jug at Appomattox Court House, and to that Grant had the shortest road.\\" Calkins, 1997, pp. 129-130. About this time, Lee also learned that Union troops had followed the Confederates across High Bridge and he could not break away from them on the north side. Having burned the bridges at Farmville, Lee's troops could not cross back to the south side of the river there. =Battle at Cumberland Church= At Cumberland Church, about northwest of High Bridge and north of Farmville, Mahone's Confederates arrived first and controlled the high ground around the church.Calkins, 1997. p. 131. They entrenched on top of a long slope of open ground, covering the stage and plank roads to Lynchburg. Lieutenant General Anderson with little more than a few stragglers and a battalion of artillery headed west when Mahone told him that Humphreys was approaching on the same side of the river with them.Marvel, 2002, p. 127. Union II Corps commander Major General Humphreys, with Brigadier Generals Miles's and de Trobriand's divisions, arrived near the Lynchburg stage road at Cumberland Church about 1:00 p.m. and became engaged not just with Mahone's division, but with the entire remaining Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.Prisoners told their Union captors that Lee's entire army was at Cumberland Church, which in fact it was or soon would be. Humphreys, 1883, p. 388. As the Union force approached, Lieutenant Colonel William T. Poague's 16-gun artillery battalion opened fire on them.Marvel, 2002, p. 128. Soldiers from Miles's division temporarily captured the guns of Captain Arthur B. Williams's North Carolina Battery but troops of Major General Bryan Grimes's division recaptured them. Despite evident confusion and disorganization, especially among the survivors of commands hard hit at Sailor's Creek and Gordon's men who had not arrived at Farmville to get rations from the trains that had been there, the Confederates began to prepare defenses at Cumberland Church.Marvel, 2002, pp. 127-128. As Humphreys's men approached, Gordon's men caught up with Mahone's and the entire effective Army of Northern Virginia was near Cumberland Church.Marvel, 2002, p. 129 Historian William Marvel stated that with artillery, about 12,000 effective Confederate men held the position at Cumberland Church. They immediately began to prepare a line of thin breastworks in a fish hook formation when they reached the hill. Mahone's division held the right of the line with Poague's battery on its right. Gordon's corps got in line to the right of Poague and Longstreet's corps moved into position next to Gordon.Humphreys, 1883, p. 390. Some of Major General Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry moved to protect Mahone's left flank. Other Confederate cavalrymen were in the rear supported by Major General Henry Heth's division. Humphreys had about the same number of men, 12,000, but did not have the high ground, fortifications or interior lines of communication that the Confederate defenders had. A heavy Union skirmish line moved forward but Miles and de Trobriand found they were unable to make a successful flank attack against Mahone along the Jamestown Road.Humphreys, 1887, p. 389. When Humphreys realized that the Confederates held a strong position in force, he recalled Barlow's division, which had been marching along the South Side Railroad following Gordon's corps toward Farmville and to guard against a Confederate move toward Danville, to rejoin the other II Corps divisions. At the same time, Humphreys sent a message to Army of the Potomac commander Major General George Meade telling him that Lee's entire army was at Cumberland Church and suggesting that a corps should come up from Farmville and attack the Confederates from the other side. Neither Humphreys nor Meade yet knew that the Confederates had destroyed the bridges at Farmville and infantry could not ford the swollen river there. After the initial Union foray was repulsed, Miles moved to his right and tried again to get his men around Mahone's left flank.Calkins, 1997, p. 133. Humphreys heard gunfire from the direction of Farmville and saw the Confederates shorten their right flank, so he thought the VI Corps had crossed the river and were starting their attack. He had Miles send Colonel George W. Scott's brigade to turn the Confederate left flank. Scott's men had to move uphill through some rolling hills, valleys and ravines to reach the Confederate fortifications. Despite heavy fire, including canister, and the movement of Brigadier General William Forney's Alabama brigade to the left to protect the flank, some of the Union force made it to the Confederate line. The 5th New Hampshire Infantry Regiment and their flag were captured when they got there. Reinforcements from Brigadier General George T. \\"Tige\\" Anderson's brigade of Georgians threw back other Union troops of Scott's brigade who were starting to have some success turning the Confederate flank. The counterattack forced Scott's men to withdraw since they were unsupported by the expected attack on the other side of the Confederate line.Marvel, 2002, p. 132. Mahone sent some of the men on his right to attack the Union skirmish line, but they were driven back twice. As night approached and no Union reinforcements had arrived to join the II Corps, Humphreys made no further attacks on the Confederate line. Barlow's division returned to the II Corps at Cumberland Church only in the evening. Barlow took Miles's place on the right flank of the Union line; Miles moved his division to the center of the line; de Trobriand held the left flank.Calkins, 1997, p. 135. =Cavalry Battle of Farmville= The gunfire heard by Humphreys was from Crook's cavalry, which had crossed the river and attacked a wagon train about up the Buckingham Plank Road from Farmville. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) J. Irvin Gregg's division led the attack, supported by Brigadier General Henry E. Davies's and Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles H. Smith's brigades and Lieutenant James H. Lord's Battery A of the 2nd United States Artillery Regiment. The wagon train was accompanied by the survivors of Anderson's (Johnson's) and Pickett's command, hundreds of stragglers, and several artillery batteries. As Gregg's brigade attacked the wagon train, Confederate Major General Thomas L. Rosser and Colonel Thomas T. Munford arrived and sent units of their cavalry divisions against Gregg's dispersed troopers, broke their attack and captured Gregg and some of his men as the others fell back.Starr, 2007, p. 476.Calkins, 1883, p. 134. They were supported by Gordon's infantry having moved down from Cumberland Church.Marvel, 2002, p. 130. Colonel Samuel B.M. Young reformed the remainder of Gregg's brigade and with Davies's men and Lord's battery attacked the wagons again. By this time, the wagon train also had infantry and artillery support. Another Union attack was repulsed but Confederate Brigadier General William Gaston Lewis was severely wounded and captured.Humphreys, 1883, pp. 390-391. After Confederate troops prevented General Robert E. Lee from personally leading a counterattack by pledging to repulse the Union cavalrymen, they forced Crook's troopers to retreat across the Appomattox River to Farmville. At about this time, Sheridan had recalled Crook to Farmville and directed him to move his division to Prospect Station, or west of Farmville, where his division arrived about midnight.Longacre, 2003, p. 165. =Casualties= In the battle up to and at Cumberland Church, the II Corps sustained casualties of 40 killed, 210 wounded, 321 missing, total 571.Calkins, 1997, p. 202. Confederate casualties are unknown. In the cavalry fight, Crook's cavalry sustained casualties of 11 killed, 33 wounded and 30 missing (including General Gregg, taken prisoner), total 74. Confederate casualties, in what is sometimes separately called the Battle of Farmville, again are unknown. Confederate casualties have been estimated at about half the Union casualties.Although the other sources cited in this article do not give casualty figures or give the Confederate casualty figures as unknown, the National Park Service CWSAC battle summary gives the number as 255. Aftermath =Grant asks for surrender; Lee non-committal= Grant wrote to Lee from Farmville at 5:00 p.m. on April 7: Grant's Adjutant-General, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Seth Williams, brought Grant's first message to Lee for delivery through the lines by General Humphreys's staff at about 8:30 p.m.Warner, Ezra J., Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders, Louisiana State University Press, 1964, . p. 563 note that Williams was Grant's inspector general at this time, although Humphreys also identifies him as adjutant general.Humphreys, 1887, p. 391. Lee showed the message to Longstreet who said: \\"Not yet.\\" Lee's reply to Grant stated that he disagreed with Grant about the hopelessness of his situation but he also was hoping to avoid \\"the useless effusion of blood\\" and asked Grant for the terms he would offer on condition of his army's surrender. Lee's answer came through the lines about one hour after it had been delivered and Williams returned with it to Farmville by a circuitous route over High Bridge.Williams's orderly was killed by Confederate pickets before Williams could establish his identity and purpose. Trudeau, 1994, p. 122. =VI Corps cheers Grant, crosses river= The VI Corps marched through Farmville on the night of April 7, lit bonfires and cheered General Grant as they passed his headquarters hotel.Calkins, 1997, pp.135-136. The corps then crossed the Appomattox River on a newly built footbridge, but waited for a pontoon bridge borrowed from the XXIV Corps for their artillery and wagons to cross after which they camped on the north bank.Calkins, 1997, p. 136. The XXIV Corps stayed south of the river and camped just to the west of Farmville. The second and third brigades of the XXV Corps were added to Gibbon's XXIV Corps as General Birney had been reassigned to the Petersburg area to command of the newly formed Division of Fort Powhatan, City Point and Wilson's Wharf. The first brigade from Birney's division did not catch up to the rest of the Army of the James until April 10.Colonel Ulysses Doubleday's brigade was assigned to Brigadier General Robert S. Foster's division and Colonel William W. Woodward's brigade and Captain Loomis L. Langdon's artillery brigade were assigned to Brigadier General John W. Turner's division. Colonel James Shaw, Jr.'s brigade was marching some distance behind the rest of the corps. Calkins, 1997, p. 136. =Cavalry, V Corps move west= Brigadier General Ranald Mackenzie's small cavalry division rode from Burkeville (or Burke's Junction) to Prince Edward Court House (now Worsham, Virginia) to cut off the road to Farmville and the Richmond and Danville Railroad at Keysville, Virginia.Calkins, 1997, pp. 136-137. They skirmished with some outpost troops and took 38 prisoners.Calkins, 1997, p. 137. By 3:00 p.m., units of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer's and Brigadier General Thomas Devins's divisions began to arrive at Prince Edward Court House from the Sailor's Creek Battlefield. After dinner, Union Cavalry commander Major General Philip SheridanSheridan's Army of the Shenandoah was still formally in existence and Sheridan acted independently, sometimes adding Crook's and Mackenzie's divisions and one or more Union Army infantry corps to his command, as ordered or approved by General Grant. ordered them to move west and they eventually camped from Farmville and from Prospect Station. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin's V Corps arrived at Prince Edward Court House at about 7:30 p.m. and went into camp on the grounds of Hampden-Sydney College.Calkins, 1997, pp. 137-138. =Lee's night march west= While Lee dealt with Grant's message, wagons continued west through roads that had become a quagmire from rain during the day and continued use, causing the death of some teams of mules and the burning of wagons that could not be moved.Marvel, 2002, p. 133. As the train moved on to the Richmond- Lynchburg Stage Road, conditions improved.Marvel, 2002, p. 134. Brigadier General Reuben Lindsay Walker had been moving the reserve artillery column independently of the main body of the Confederate army. He had moved through Cumberland Court House the previous afternoon. Having heard about the defeat at Sailor's Creek and the movement out of Farmville, Walker moved to the north, came to the Buckingham Plank Road and moved through Curdsville, Virginia about midday. There, the column moved toward New Store to the southwest and halted for the night, as did the wagon train and hospital train that had been moving from Farmville.Marvel, 2002, pp. 134-135. Lee knew that his army again had to make a night march from Cumberland Church to get ahead of the Union forces, obtain rations at Appomattox Station and possibly still escape to Danville via Campbell Court House (now Rustburg, Virginia) and through Pittsylvania County, Virginia.Calkins, 1997, p. 138. Longstreet's corps, with General Lee, moved via the Piedmont Coal Mine Road, also known as the Buckingham Plank Road through Curdsville toward a back road to New Store, Virginia. They covered the retreat of the last wagon train before withdrawing from the Cumberland Church area.Marvel, 2002, p. 135. Gordon's corps, followed by Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry, moved via the Richmond-Lynchburg Stage Road, a shorter route, toward New Store. Humphreys sent intelligence to Meade at about 3:00 p.m. that Confederate prisoners had said that the Army of Northern Virginia was headed for Lynchburg so Meade and Sheridan had good intelligence about Lee's plan. That night at Cumberland Church, Humphreys's men slept while Lee's force withdrew. On the evening of April 7, Confederate Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge and the Confederacy's quartermaster general, commissary general, chief engineer and various War Department officials rode through Pamplin Station and saw the remainder of the supply trains from Farmville.Marvel, 2002, p. 136. The commissary general suggested the cars be moved because Union cavalry were not far from Pamplin but Breckinridge refused to do so without being able to notify Lee. On the next day, Crook's cavalry passed through Pamplin on their way to Appomattox Station and destroyed these cars.Humphreys, 1883, p. 396. General Humphreys stated in his book that the delay forced upon the Confederate Army by the engagement at Cumberland Church lost Lee valuable time. It led to the loss of Confederate supplies on April 8 when Custer's division of Sheridan's cavalry arrived at Appomattox Station first and captured the supply trains there. Custer's cavalry captured Confederate supplies and about 25 cannons and took about 1,000 prisoners at the Battle of Appomattox Station.Calkins, 1997, p. 155. The delay also allowed the Union cavalry and the V Corps and XXIV Corp to reach Appomattox Court House on the morning of April 9 in order to prevent a Confederate breakthrough toward Lynchburg.

Irwin Caplan (May 24, 1919 ‚Äì February 22, 2007), nicknamed Cap, was an American illustrator, painter, designer and cartoonist, best known as the creator of The Saturday Evening Post cartoon series, Famous Last Words, which led to newspaper syndication of the feature in 1956. Early life Caplan grew up in Seattle's Madison Park neighborhood where his parents took note of his drawings and enrolled him in art classes. As a teenager, Caplan won $10 in a citywide poster contest, and at Garfield High School, he illustrated the 1935 yearbook, The Arrow. He painted murals of a circus and Paul Bunyan on walls of the school, where he graduated in 1937. At the University of Washington, after he spent three years contributing to Columns, the University's humor magazine, the staff wanted him to be the editor. However, the faculty claimed the magazine needed \\"new blood\\" and designated as editor Lynn Scholes of Steilacoom, Washington, who had never worked on the magazine. This led to an emotional incident at the annual publications banquet in which the magazine's first female editor, Saxon Miller of Vancouver, refused to introduce Scholes and walked out, calling Scholes a \\"hand-picked editor\\" with no experience compared to Caplan. World War II The following year, after graduating from the University of Washington with a fine arts degree, Caplan served during World War II as an Army illustrator, contributing to several military publications. Beginning in the Tank Force, he advanced to the Army Intelligence art department. When a Signal Corps editorial artist watched Caplan draw a cartoon and commented, \\"You know you can sell that stuff,\\" Caplan put it in the mail and sold it to Collier's, launching his career as a cartoonist.\\"Battle at 'U' over New Editor\\", Ellensburg Daily Record, May 25, 1940. Cartoons, illustrations and paintings Irwin and Madeline Caplan were married in 1948 when he returned to Seattle, where he teamed with illustrator Ted Rand and five other artists to form Graphic Studios, creating corporate logos and a variety of advertising artwork. In addition to such accounts as the Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone, Bardahl and the Mutual Life Insurance Company, Caplan also illustrated the 1962 Seattle World's Fair poster (sponsored by the Frederick & Nelson department store), plus work for the Seattle World's Fair Alaska Pavilion. He was the art director for Spokane's Expo '74. In the late 1940s through the early 1960s, Caplan's distinctive, crisp cartoon style appeared in Collier's, Esquire, Liberty, Life, Parade and other leading publications. For the Sunday supplement magazine This Week, he contributed a regular weekly thematic grouping of cartoons, sometimes in the form of a vertical comic strip. In addition to Famous Last Words, his other syndicated feature was 48 States of Mind. Caplan's paintings were exhibited at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and his work was in the permanent collections of the Seattle Art Museum and the Henry Gallery. He taught art at the University of Washington School of Art and at Seattle Central Community College.Seattle Times obituary Caplan lived in Seattle with his wife and three children. He maintained a summer residence on Vashon Island in Washington's Puget Sound. In January 1966, following heavy rains in the Pacific Northwest, a mudslide pushed his Vashon home 25 yards from its foundation, dumping much of the house into Puget Sound. An image of Caplan's remaining wreckage was distributed to newspapers as an AP Wirephoto under the headlines, \\"Mudslide Carries Half a House into Puget Sound\\" and \\"It's Now a Split Level\\".The Milwaukee Journal, January 8, 1966. Awards In 1972, he received the National Cartoonists Society's Advertising and Illustration Award, followed by the 1981 Advertising Award. In November 1999, his artwork was exhibited at Tacoma's Random Modern Gallery in its \\"Northwest Art 1920-1962\\" survey exhibition. In 2005, the murals he painted in 1937 survived a renovation of Garfield High School. One small section showing two trapeze artists was left in place where it had been painted directly on concrete. Portions painted on plaster adhered to clay tile were removed because of seismic safety concerns. Divided into four-by-four foot sections, the plaster paintings were framed and auctioned.Eskenazi, Stuart. \\"Saving the soul of a school,\\" Seattle Times, September 11, 2005. Caplan went back to look at the murals in 2003 and commented: :I was very surprised. I didn't think they would stay in as good condition and have as much impact as they actually have. One story I remember from painting them was using a \\"flit\\" gun. We didn't have airbrush in those days, and there was a lot of area to be covered. A flit gun is used to spray insecticide, but I dumped the insecticide out and used it to spray color. It had a pump action and a little bucket that hung suspended along the tube. I painted during art periods, spraying away, and the kids in the class, when they sneezed, they would sneeze in color.Micklin, Lee. \\"Irwin Caplan\\" Bibliography *Cowboys and Engines (1962) A collection of automobile cartoons, published by Travelers Insurance.

Map of Santa Rosa Island Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The Battle of Santa Rosa Island (October 9, 1861) was an unsuccessful Confederate attempt to take Union-held Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island, Florida.  Background  Santa Rosa Island is a 40-mile barrier island in the U.S. state of Florida, thirty miles from the Alabama state border. At the western end stands Fort Pickens, which in the fall of 1861 was garrisoned by parts of the 1st, 2nd, and 5th U. S. artillery and the 3rd U.S. Infantry, under command of Col. Harvey Brown, of the 5th artillery. The 6th New York Volunteer Infantry, commanded by Col. William Wilson, was encamped outside the fort, a short distance east of it.

Richard Anderson crossed from the mainland to Santa Rosa Island with 1,200 men in two small steamers to surprise the Union camps and capture Fort Pickens. He landed on the north beach about four miles east of Fort Pickens and divided his command into three columns. After proceeding about three miles, the Confederates surprised the 6th Regiment, New York Volunteers, in its camp and routed the regiment. Gen. Anderson then adopted a defensive stance to entice the Federals to leave the fort and attack. Receiving reinforcements, Col. Harvey Brown sallied against the Confederates, who reembarked and returned to the mainland. The Union loss was 14 killed, 29 wounded and 24 captured or missing. General Braxton Bragg and Lieutenant Hamel, commanding the Confederate forces at Pensacola, reported their loss as \\"30 or 40 killed and wounded,\\" but a Confederate newspaper, found by Lieut. Seeley a few days after the occurrence, gave the total casualties as 175. Maj. Israel Vogdes, of the 1st artillery, was captured, and on the Confederate side Gen. Anderson was severely wounded. The camp of the 6th N. Y. was partially destroyed.

It combines a reading of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophical works and of Jean Genet's autobiographical writing. \\"One of Derrida's more inscrutable books,\\" its form and content invite a reflection on the nature of literary genre and of writing. Structure and content =Columns= left Following the structure of Jean Genet's Ce qui est rest√© d'un Rembrandt d√©chir√© en petits carr√©s bien r√©guliers, et foutu aux chiottes [\\"What Remains of a Rembrandt Torn into Four Equal Pieces and Flushed Down the Toilet\\"], the book is written in two columns in different type sizes. The left column is about Hegel, the right column is about Genet. Each column weaves its way around quotations of all kinds, both from the works discussed and from dictionaries‚ÄîDerrida's \\"side notes\\", described as \\"marginalia, supplementary comments, lengthy quotations, and dictionary definitions.\\" Sometimes words are cut in half by a quotation which may last several pages. A Dutch commentator, recalling Derrida's observation that he wrote with two hands, the one commenting on the other, noted that the two-column format aims to open a space for what the individual texts excluded, in an auto-deconstructive mode. Allan Megill described the text as a \\"literary-philosophical collage.\\" Typography is an important part of the text's presentation and argument; the English translation was designed by Richard Eckersley, noted for his renderings of deconstructionist texts. Gregor Dotzauer, writing for Der Tagesspiegel, argues that the two columns are explicitly phallic symbols, opposing each other in a power struggle that neither can win. Literary theorist Susan Handelman has described the book's structure as being reminiscent of the format of the Talmud. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, in a 1977 article published in Diacritics, interprets the columns as the legs of a woman, and Derrida's marginal notes as a male member in the act of penetration: \\"As the father's phallus works in the mother's hymen, between two legs, so Glas works at origins, between two columns, between Hegel and Genet.\\" According to Gayatri Spivak, the two columns should be seen as architectural elements: \\"capital, pyramid, pillar, belfry and so on.\\" In between those columns Derrida attempts to find space for himself in the form of marginal notes. This fight for space is reminiscent of an adolescent rebellion against a looming father figure, Hegel, and Derrida notes that his own father died while he was writing Glas. This rebellion against his inheritance also evident from the way in which he creates confusion by juxtaposing his initial, \\"D,\\" to distracting red herrings: \\"The debris of d-words is scattered all over the pages. Derrida describes (d√©crit), writes d (d√©-√©crit), and cries d (d√©-crit).\\" Spivak notes, \\"I can read Glas as a fiction of Derrida's proper name turning into a thing, [...] crypting the signature so that it becomes impossible to spell it out.\\" =Autobiography and the signature= The specific literary genre problematized in Glas is autobiography, and its inquiry traces the very concept of the signature, which in autobiography marks the identity of the author with the narrator of the text. Following Plato, Derrida sees the relation between author and text as one of filiation, but unlike Plato's idea of filiation, which involves only the father and the child, for Derrida author alternates between the father and the mother of the text. In this relationship, the author's signature becomes the guarantor of the text's truth, \\"it becomes its surrogate parent,\\" according to Jane Marie Todd. The Genet column discusses his autobiographical writings, where one of the issues is Genet's very name‚Äîit is not that of his father, but of his mother, who abandoned him shortly after birth. According to Todd, \\"in the mother who abandons her bastard child, leaving only her name, Derrida finds a figure for the author/text/signature relationship.\\" Critical response Glas is described as experimental and obscure. Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \\"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\\", acknowledging that to others it \\"may prove a disadvantage\\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \\"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \\"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\\" Derrida himself described the text as \\"a sort of a wake,\\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, > It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida > has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate > and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to > read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates > across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) > separating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \\"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\\". In his estimation reading the book is \\"a scandalously random experience\\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns‚Äîconsecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \\"exuberantly clever, punning text\\", it \\"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \\"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \\"dismissive account\\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \\"random experience\\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \\"sacred texts of Judaism\\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \\"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \\"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \\"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \\"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer‚Äîyet on the other hand, \\"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \\"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\\", and Mark Poster holds that \\"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \\"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\\" Influence According to Denis Donoghue and Morris Dickstein, Geoffrey Hartman is heavily influenced by Glas. Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut referred to Glas as the \\"quintessence of the discourse of the 'sixties\\", though Ned Lukacher notes that this amounts to \\"a glib dismissal of Derrida's masterpiece\\" by restricting its scope and enclosing it as a naive text whose erasure is willed by the writing subject, whereas Lukacher maintains that \\"Derrida never contests that there is always a subject that decides; his point is rather that the decision never took place on the grounds the subject thought it did and that the decision has effects that the subject cannot account for.\\" According to Lukacher, \\"The publication of this translation and its brilliantly assembled apparatus will have a lasting and profound impact on philosophical and literary theory in English.\\" Italian painter Valerio Adami based three drawings on Glas, each called \\"Etude pour un dessin d'apr√®s Glas\\" (reprinted in his Derriere le miroir).

Boyd Gaming announced the project in January 2006, as a replacement for its Stardust Resort and Casino. Echelon Place, to be built on , was to include a casino, 4 hotels providing 5,300 rooms, 25 restaurants and bars, and the Las Vegas ExpoCenter. Echelon Place was also to include the $2.9 billion Echelon Resort, with 3,300 hotel rooms. Other hotels were also to include a Shangri-La Hotel and two hotels by Morgans Hotel Group: a Delano Hotel and a Mondrian Hotel. The project was also to include a $500 million shopping promenade, to be co-developed and managed by General Growth Properties. The Stardust was closed in November 2006, and subsequently demolished. Groundbreaking for the Echelon project occurred on June 19, 2007, with an opening scheduled for the third quarter of 2010. However, construction was suspended on August 1, 2008, as Morgans Hotel Group and General Growth Properties could not obtain financing for their portions of the project, due to the effects of the Great Recession. As of 2012, Boyd Gaming still intended to finish construction of the project, and received a six-year extension from the county. However, in March 2013, Boyd Gaming sold the site to the Genting Group, which began developing it as a 3,500-room hotel and casino named Resorts World Las Vegas, scheduled to open in 2021. Some of the unfinished Echelon buildings were incorporated into the Resorts World project.  History  In the late 1990s, Boyd Gaming postponed plans to redevelop the site of its Stardust Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, to instead proceed with its Borgata hotel- casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. After the Borgata opened in 2003, Boyd Gaming stated that it would wait until the 2005 opening of nearby competitor Wynn Las Vegas before starting a redevelopment plan for the Stardust site. While no specific plans had been considered for the site up to that time, future redevelopment possibilities would include demolishing the Stardust or building an adjacent resort on property located behind the Stardust. In November 2004, Boyd Gaming purchased a 13-acre parcel of land for $43 million, as part of its eventual redevelopment plans for the Stardust site. The 13-acre property was occupied by a 639-room Budget Suites hotel, and was contiguous to the Stardust. The sale gave Boyd Gaming a total of , and the company was in the early stages of a master-plan for the site. Boyd Gaming used the Borgata as an example of how to redevelop the Stardust site. Boyd Gaming announced the $4 billion Echelon Place project on January 3, 2006, to replace the Stardust. It would be a mixed-use project similar to Project CityCenter, also on the Las Vegas Strip. Echelon Place would include a casino, a shopping promenade, and several hotels with a total of 5,300 rooms. Two of the hotels, the Delano and the Mondrian, would be developed by Morgans Hotel Group at a total cost of $700 million, while Boyd Gaming would own the $2.9 billion, 3,300-room Echelon Resort. It was also announced that Boyd Gaming executive Bob Boughner would leave his position at the Borgata to lead development of Echelon Place, under the position of president and chief executive officer of Echelon Resorts. Boughner had previously overseen construction and development of the Borgata, and had also overseen construction of the Stardust's 32-story tower, which was opened in 1991. Boughner and his executives spent much of 2005 developing a list of prospective partners for the project. Project planners stated that the 63-acre site was large enough to contain construction without affecting nearby businesses and tourists, and also said that because of the site's easy access and proximity to Industrial Road and Interstate 15, the resort would not cause traffic delays after opening. However, it was later estimated that the project, upon completion, would bring an additional 12,190 vehicles to the busy Las Vegas Strip area. Construction was initially scheduled to begin in early 2007, following the demolition of the Stardust, with an opening scheduled for early 2010. Boyd Gaming's stock dropped eight percent in the days following Echelon Place's announcement, due to skepticism about the project. In October 2006, Boyd Gaming agreed to sell its Barbary Coast hotel- casino to Harrah's Entertainment in exchange for of property located adjacent to the Stardust that was previously occupied by the Westward Ho Hotel and Casino. The deal gave Boyd Gaming a total of 87 contiguous acres, although the company said the additional land did not change its current plans for Echelon Place, while stating that the new property could allow for future expansion of the Echelon project. The sale was completed several months later, and two acres of the newly acquired property were to be used for roadways to alleviate traffic congestion, while the other 22 acres would remain available for future development, possibly as a residential component. In Echelon Place's design plans submitted to the County Commission, Boyd Gaming included the option of converting up to 1,000 rooms in the Delano and Mondrian hotels to condominiums, although the company had no intentions of adding condominiums to the project and only included them in the design plans as a potential option. Boyd Gaming executives were concerned about overbuilding of condominiums in Las Vegas and a possible lack of demand for them. The Stardust was closed on November 1, 2006, and its 32-story tower was imploded on March 13, 2007. Because of Boyd Gaming's inexperience with retail, the company partnered with General Growth Properties (GGP) in May 2007. Under the deal, GGP would co- develop and manage the Echelon project's $500 million shopping mall, while financing $100 million of the cost. =Construction and cancellation= A groundbreaking ceremony for the project occurred on June 19, 2007, and was attended by approximately 200 people. By that point, the name had been shortened to \\"Echelon\\". The project's opening was expected for the third quarter of 2010. At the time of groundbreaking, the cost of the project had grown to $4.8 billion, with the two hotels by Morgans Hotel Group expected to cost a total of $950 million. The $800 million increase on the project's overall cost was partly due to increased costs on construction materials. Bill Boyd, the chairman of Boyd Gaming, said that the company \\"made the right decision\\" in delaying its Stardust redevelopment plans a decade earlier: \\"The time that we took allowed for our company to build a much greater foundation. We can see there is a demand for this type of project now and we believe the demand will be there when we're ready to open.\\" The Echelon project would include , and would take up nearly three-quarters of the 87-acre property. Boughner said about the project's multiple hotels, \\"Rather than create 5,000 rooms in one big box, it was much more important to create five different sensibilities. There are a variety of hotel sizes and experiences. The casino and the retail surround all the hotels giving a sense of connection.\\" Boyd Gaming believed Echelon Place's primary competitors would be Project CityCenter, The Venetian, the Bellagio, and Wynn Las Vegas. Boughner said the resort would not have a theme: \\"Echelon, in terms of architecture, is more about designing a building that will evoke an emotion. A theme doesn't evoke an emotion, it evokes a cheap thrill.\\" The entire project was overseen by Tishman Construction, but different general contractors worked on each of the project's five hotels. Marnell Corrao Associates was the general contractor for the project's main hotel, Echelon Tower, also known as Hotel Echelon. The construction site consisted of approximately 800 workers, who were divided between two shifts, and worked six days a week. Three of the project's hotels ‚Äì The Enclave, Hotel Echelon, and Shangri-La Las Vegas ‚Äì would be housed in three attached towers, which began to take form in June 2008. That month, a carpenter working on Echelon Tower died after falling 15 feet and hitting his head. A union official denied that the project's construction workers were being rushed to meet deadlines, although the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration later determined that the worker died as the result of safety violations and being rushed. Marnell Corrao Associates was fined $11,000 in the worker's death. Although the fine was disputed, it was eventually paid. Ultimately, there had been 44 injuries among Marnell's 280 workers at the Echelon site. On August 1, 2008, Boyd Gaming announced that construction would be halted for three to four quarters due to economic conditions, as Morgans Hotel Group and GGP were unable to obtain financing to build their portions of the project because of the Great Recession. Boyd Gaming had spent $500 million on the project, and planned to finance $3.3 billion of the total budget. The company's stock rose 20 percent on the day of the postponement, which was praised by investors, who were concerned about the state of the economy and the company's ability to complete such a large project. At that time of the delay, the site consisted of three steel-framed hotel towers, each standing eight stories high. Some work was expected to continue in order to maintain the steel and concrete structures. The two hotels by Morgans Hotel Group, now expected to cost a total of $1 billion, had been scheduled to begin construction that summer. Local economists and housing analysts believed the project's postponement would delay a housing recovery in the Las Vegas Valley, as the project would employ 10,000 people upon its eventual opening. In September 2008, Boyd Gaming revised its development agreement with Morgans Hotel Group, which would have through 2009 to obtain financing for its two hotels in the Echelon project. Boyd Gaming was also in discussions to revise its agreement with GGP, which had intended to remain involved in the project. However, GGP experienced financial difficulties and the agreement was dissolved in October 2008. Later that month, Boyd Gaming announced that it would evaluate alternative options for the Echelon project throughout 2009 and that construction would not resume during that year. Because the project was in the early phase of construction, it had the potential to be reconfigured and downsized. Other options included recruiting new joint venture partners and building the project in phases. Selling the property was not an option at the time. The company planned to spend approximately $150 million over the subsequent few quarters to complete some of the project's steel fabrication. At the end of 2008, the site of a 25-year- old McDonald's became part of the Echelon land following the opening of a new McDonald's on adjacent property, formerly occupied by the Westward Ho's casino. Exposed steel frames in 2012 In October 2009, amid falling profits, Boyd announced that the project would be suspended for at least three to five years. In July 2012, the Clark County Zoning Commission granted Boyd Gaming a six-year extension to complete the project, which was considered an eyesore. The company also worked with the commission to create a $4 million beautification plan for the construction site that was expected to be finished later that year. The plan would include landscaping the portion of the site that faced the Las Vegas Strip, and covering the complex's steel frames with material, while construction equipment had already been removed from the site. Boyd Gaming expected to resume construction within three to five years, with an opening as late as 2018. The company expected to spend $15.5 million to $17 million annually to maintain the site, for expenses such as security and property taxes. In March 2013, Boyd sold the Echelon site for $350 million to the Genting Group, a Malaysia-based gaming company which began developing the site as the 3,500-room Resorts World Las Vegas. Some of the unfinished Echelon buildings were incorporated into the Resorts World project, which is scheduled to open in 2021, after several delays.

It was an important breakthrough in evaluating the performance of visual devices and guided the development of future systems. Using Johnson's criteria, many predictive models for sensor technology have been developed that predict the performance of sensor systems under different environmental and operational conditions. History Night vision systems enabled the measurement of visual thresholds following World War II. The 1950s also marked a time of notable development in the performance modeling of night vision imaging systems. From 1957 to 1958, Johnson, a United States Army Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD)http://www.nvl.army.mil scientist, was working to develop methods of predicting target detection, orientation, recognition, and identification. Working with volunteer observers, Johnson used image intensifier equipment to measure the volunteer observer's ability to identify scale model targets under various conditions. His experiments produced the first empirical data on perceptual thresholds that was expressed in terms of line pairs. In the first Night Vision Image Intensifier Symposium in October 1958, Johnson presented his findings in a paper entitled \\"Analysis of Image Forming Systems\\", which contained the list that would later be known as Johnson's criteria. Criteria The minimum required resolution according to Johnson's criteria are expressed in terms of line pairs of image resolution across a target, in terms of several tasks: * Detection, an object is present (1.0 +/‚àí 0.25 line pairs) * Orientation, symmetrical, asymmetric, horizontal, or vertical (1.4 +/‚àí 0.35 line pairs) * Recognition, the type object can be discerned, a person versus a car (4 +/‚àí 0.8 line pairs) * Identification, a specific object can be discerned, a woman versus a man, the specific car (6.4 +/‚àí 1.5 line pairs) These amounts of resolution give a 50 percent probability of an observer discriminating an object to the specified level. Additionally, the line pairs refer to lines being displayed on an interlaced CRT monitor. Each line pair corresponds to 2 pixels of a film image, or an image displayed on an LCD monitor.

It was marketed in the US as the Helix and in other parts of the world as the Fusion or Spazio. It was so successful that, as of 2009, it was still in production in Japan.  Background  In the early 1980s, Honda introduced a line of scooters known as the CH series, comprising the CH50, 80, 125, 150, and 250 models. In the US, these were known as \\"Elite\\" scooters but overseas they were marketed under the \\"Spacy\\" name. The CH250 could reach highway speeds and be used for long-range touring. Honda then introduced the CN250 or Helix. This model lengthened the CH250 by , placed an integrated trunk in the rear of the machine and lowered the seat. The added length allowed a feet forward seating position and a smoother ride than that of previous models. The top speed of the machine was limited to 70-75 mph (about 113‚Äì121 km/h) but the drivetrain was of an under-stressed design allowing extended running at or near top speed.  History  The Fusion CN250 found instant popularity in Japan. In Europe, the Japanese put Italian makers under pressure to improve their scooters' capabilities and reliability. In the U.S., the Helix was a hit with middle-aged and older people. The Helix attracted customers that desired long-range touring capabilities, but did not want to shift, were unable to shift, or did not want a large, heavy conventional motorcycle. The CN250 was a capable machine complete with trip odometer, fuel and temperature gauges, glove compartment and trunk. The Helix was in its last year in 2001 and was to be replaced by the NSS250. The NSS250 was marketed in the U.S. as the Reflex and in other countries as the Forza. The Reflex handled better and had a higher top speed than the Helix, but some Helix fans argued that there was a trade-off in seating comfort and ride. In the Japanese market the Helix had an aftermarket and cult following with the younger generation, not unlike sport bikes in America. Honda returned the CN250 (Helix) to all markets in 2004 as the customer base was still there. In the U.S., the Helix and the Reflex were discontinued with the 2007 model.  Versions and variations  Honda made very few changes to the Helix through its 20-year run. Aluminum rims replaced steel wheels in the early 90s, and a few emission controls were added to the engine. Apart from those changes, the machine stayed the same right down to its 1980s-style, multi-colored digital gauges. The CN250 was also manufactured and sold within Canada as the \\"Helix\\" as the first \\"maxiscooter\\" of its kind to be offered in that country. However, production within Canada was halted after the initial production year of 1986. Canadian citizens could still purchase a Helix as an import from the U.S., and a majority of Honda dealerships in Canada did not even stock a \\"floor model\\" for display. Additionally, the purchaser will often be required to pay or finance upfront for their purchase, sight unseen. It was the Japanese scooter \\"scene\\" that saved the Honda Helix/Fusion. Honda had intended to discontinue production in the late 1990s in favor of the \\"Reflex\\" and went so far as to cease production at one point. However, pressure from the members of Japan's now-outraged multitude of Fusion riding groups and modification enthusiasts pressured Honda into reinstating production with an announcement to that effect in February 2003, to begin production once again for the 2005 production year.

He played 37 Test matches for South Africa between 1949 and 1960 and was one of the best off spinners the game has seen. He was the fastest South African to take 100 wickets in Tests (in terms of matches played) until Dale Steyn claimed the record in March 2008. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1956. He was known as 'Toey' due to his habit of stubbing his toes into the ground before every delivery. He would also kiss the badge on his cap before handing it to the umpire at the start of every over. The Tayfields were a cricketing family; Hugh's uncle Sidney Martin played for Worcestershire County Cricket Club and his brothers Arthur and Cyril both played for the Transvaal cricket team as did two cousins, Hugh Martin and Ian Tayfield.Hugh Tayfield, CricketArchive. Retrieved 2020-03-10. Tayfield made his debut for Natal as a 17-year-old in 1945‚Äì46. He took a hat- trick against Transvaal aged 18 and, when Athol Rowan was injured, he was hurried into the South African Test side against Australia in 1949‚Äì50. He played in all five Tests and, on a sticky wicket at Durban, took seven wicket for 23 (7/23) when Australia crashed from 31 for no wicket to 75 all out. After a quiet tour to England in 1951 when he was called up as a substitute for Rowan, he became South Africa's mainstay in Australia in 1952‚Äì53 under Jack Cheetham. He claimed 30 wickets in the series, 13 of them at Melbourne, to secure South Africa's first win over Australia in 42 years. Tayfield returned to England with more success in 1955, taking 143 wickets on the tour and 26 in the series including nine in South Africa's victory at Headingley. In the defeat at the Oval, the match which decided the rubber, he took five wickets for 60 runs in 53.3 overs. Bowling for South Africa against England at Durban in 1956‚Äì57, he bowled 119 balls in England's first innings followed immediately by a further 18 in the second without conceding a run, a Test and first-class cricket record. He bowled over the wicket, close to the stumps, drifting the ball away from the bat in the air and then spinning it back through the gate. He did not spin the ball as much as England's Jim Laker but was unerringly accurate and could bowl for long spells. He set himself aggressive fields, in contrast to his steady bowling, with two silly mid ons for the snick prompted by a botched drive through the tempting hole he'd left at cover. He formed a fine partnership with Trevor Goddard and, backed by South Africa's athletic fielding, took 37 wickets at a bowling average of 17.18 runs per wicket against England in the 1956‚Äì57 series. He took nine for 113 in the second innings of the Fourth Test at Johannesburg, bowling unchanged on the last day, and was carried off the field by his team mates. Tayfield caught the only batsman he didn't dismiss. In England in 1960 he took 123 wickets on the tour but failed in the Tests and, his career on the wane, lost his place in 1961‚Äì62. He was married and divorced five times.Wisden 1995, pp. 1395‚Äì96. Tayfield died in a hospital at Durban on 25 February 1994, at the age of 65.

It was one of the first digital history centers in the world, established by Roy Rosenzweig in 1994 to research and use digital media and information technology in historical research, education, digital tools and resources, digital preservation, and outreach. Its current director is T. Mills Kelly.  Digital preservation  Center for History and New Media Offices Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Center for History and New Media in partnership with the American Social History Project at the City University of New York organized the September 11 Digital Archive with funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. With the September 11 Digital Archive, CHNM and ASHP utilized electronic media to collect, preserve, and present the past, with a digital repository of material including more than 150,000 first- hand accounts, emails, images, and other digital materials. It became the Library of Congress' first major digital acquisition. This project inspired CHNM's the Hurricane Digital Memory Bank, which collected stories and digital artefacts related to the Hurricane Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. CHNM continues to explore methods, tools, and technologies for archiving and preserving information, data, and documents digitally. One of its newest project, Pandemic Religion, collects sources on the practice of religion during the 2019-20 COVID-19 pandemic.  Educational resources  The Center for History and New Media worked in partnership with the American Social History Project (ASHP) at the City University of New York, to develop an online resource directed at American History teachers, along with online resources about the French Revolution. Other projects have focused on developing online educational resources about World History, and a project on historical thinking, in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs National Museum of American History. One of its newest projects, in conjunction with the National Museum of American Diplomacy, involves the creation of three historical diplomacy classroom simulations for secondary education instructors. CHNM is also involved with educational outreach with teachers in Virginia school districts. CHNM has also developed a number of online databases and other resources for historians and history teachers, including a listing of 1,200 history departments worldwide, a practical guide to Digital History, a collection of essays on history and new media. Another online database is Making the History of 1989, which chronicles the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. Created in collaboration with the German Historical Institute and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the 1989 Project is powered by CHNM's Omeka software, and includes resources for teachers and students, ranging from lesson plans to an archive of primary source materials. CHNM collaborated with the Jewish Women's Archive on Katrina's Jewish Voices, a virtual archive of stories, images, and reflections about the New Orleans and Gulf Coast Jewish communities before and after Hurricane Katrina.  Software resources  Community area of the center CHNM is responsible for the development of two notable open source software projects: Zotero and Omeka. Zotero is reference management software which is used by academics to read and cite the academic literature. Omeka is a content management system that uses the Dublin Core metadata standard to build digital collections and publish digital exhibits. Both projects are free, and reflect CHNM's dedication to democratizing the practice of history. The Center for History and New Media also distributes a set of free additional digital tools for historians and teachers, including Web Scrapbook, Survey Builder, Scribe (a note taking application designed with historians in mind), Poll Builder, H-Bot (an automated historical fact finder), and Syllabus Finder, which allows you to find and compare syllabi from thousands of universities and colleges on any topic, using the Google search engine. In 2017, with financial support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, CHNM released Tropy, a free and open-source desktop knowledge organization application to manage and describe photographs of research materials.  Scholarship  Projects like Zotero provide tools for historians to research and analyze the past. But will digital media change the nature of scholarly argument, communication, and publication? In order to encourage experimentation in this arena, American Quarterly in collaboration with the American Studies Crossroads Project and CHNM organized an experiment in hypertext publishing. Four essays, covering such diverse topics as photos, as legal evidence, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in film, early comic strips, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, offer contrasting approaches to using digital media for scholarly presentations. Imaging the French Revolution is another experiment in digital scholarship. In a series of essays, seven scholars analyze forty- two images of crowds and crowd violence in the French Revolution. Offering the most relevant examples and comments from an on-line forum, those same scholars consider issues of interpretation, methodology, and the impact of digital media on scholarship. Finally, Interpreting the Declaration of Independence by Translation is a roundtable of historians brought together to discuss the translation and reception of the Declaration of Independence in Japan, Mexico, Russia, China, Poland, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Israel. In addition to these reflections, the site includes actual translations of the Declaration into several different languages and \\"re-translations\\" back into English to illustrate the effects of translation on how a key historical document has been understood.  Public outreach  CHNM has also developed some projects with an explicit focus on broad, public audiences. Gulag: Many Days, Many Lives is a web-based exhibit funded by NEH and being developed in collaboration with the Gulag Museum in Perm, Russia, will provide a multifaceted consideration of the human struggle for survival in the Gulag, the brutal and often lethal Soviet system of forced labor concentration camps. History News Network features articles, placing current events in historical perspective, written by historians of all political persuasions.  Name change  On April 15, 2011, the Center for History and New Media became the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, in memory of its founder.

The village used to be on the main A6 road but a bypass around the village was opened in 1981 at a cost of ¬£1.6m.Geolocation website, accessed 1 January 2013 History =Origin= The village name is derived from the Danish word 'hoh', in \\"Sifels hoh\\", meaning \\"Sifel's hill\\". The Danes were thought to have been the earliest settlers here. The Domesday Book (1086 ‚Äì Siuuilessou or Sewilessou) records two manors, the larger held by Hugh of Walter, brother of Saher, and this later became the manor of Wrest. A smaller manor, believed to be that of Newbury, was owned by a concubine of Nigel d'Aubigny. The first market was held here weekly on Tuesdays and annual fair on 1 May from 1318. A Latinized form of the village name may be seen as \\"Sevelesho\\", in a legal record of 1430, where the defendants William Butte, yeoman & William Clerk, husbandman lived.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40 / 677; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no677/bCP40no677dorses/IMG_1331.htm; last entry By 1563 there were 21 families living in Silsoe. The village growth was largely influenced by the needs of the Wrest Park estate and most of the inhabitants were servants, gardeners, stable hands and blacksmiths who lived in thatched and terrace cottages some of which still exist today. There was also a baker, who supplied Wrest House, and in the roof of the old bakehouse off the High Street, the oven ventilation can still be seen. From 1715 an annual fair was held on 10 September and a weekly market on Wednesdays. By the mid-19th century a number of trades were present in the village. There was a butcher, a milkman, cobbler, draper, builder and a grocer. =The Wrest Estate= Wrest Park House, formerly home to research laboratories, now looked after by English Heritage The Wrest Estate, in turn, provided the village with a church ‚Äì St James's, a school and a row of almhouses, so sited that a row of cottages was hidden from the gentry's view as they drove from the Park to the church in nearby Flitton. Silsoe's position on a main road to London and halfway between Bedford and Luton made it a favourite halt for drovers and travellers stopping at the George coaching inn (first mentioned in 1624) on the High Street. Silsoe had many inns including The White Hart, The Ragged Staff, Duke of Kent's Arms, The Bell, The Battle of Alma (or known as The Mouse's Hole in West End Road), Lord Nelson (Newbury Lane). Now only the George and Star and Garter in the High Street remain. During the First World War Wrest House was used as a military hospital until 1916 when the house was damaged by fire. Lady Lucas, the last member of the de Grey dynasty, sold the House and estate before an auction that was to have been held at the Mart, Tokenhouse Yard, London EC2 on 17 July 1917. Wrest Park's historic house and magnificent gardens are now part of English Heritage and have been restored and opened to the public from 4 August 2011. =Silsoe College= The village was, until 2007, the location of the Silsoe Research Institute, a BBSRC-funded body, in Wrest Park. The village also was home to Cranfield University's Silsoe campus for agricultural engineering. The former campus grounds are being redeveloped for housing, community and business use. The college was founded as the National College of Agricultural Engineering. Since 2007 three property developers, Miller Homes, Bloor Homes and Bellway, have produced several hundred family homes. Stringent adherence to reflect the character of the village was followed, thus attracting new families and residents seeking village life. This area is often referred to as the \\"New Estate\\". =Church of St James and War Memorial= The church stands on the site of a much earlier free chapel of St. Leonard, first mentioned in the Liber Antiquus (1209‚Äì35), that became a chapel of ease in the 17th century. The chapel belonged to the abbey of Elstow. Eventually the chapel had a central tower. In the fourteenth century two chantries were founded in the chapel. In the early 19th century Thomas Philip Robinson, 2nd Earl de Grey (1781‚Äì1859), wished to construct a spire but the weight of the structure proved too much for the supporting walls and the whole building collapsed. The church was rebuilt between 1829‚Äì1831 and opened on 20 February 1831. It consists of chancel, nave, aisles and a tower containing three bells. Nikolaus Pevsner admired it as 'an astonishing job for its day'. The architect was Smith of Hereford who achieved 'an antiquarian accuracy here extremely rare ten years before Pugin'. Other sources such as Arthur Mee suggest that the architect was Earl de Grey, confirmed by Charles Read.Earl de Grey, Charles Read (2007) Built in local ironstone, all embattled. The altar rails are made from 17th century oak taken from the chapel of the original Wrest House. Most of its stained glass windows represent the families of Wrest House. On Sunday. 25 July 1909 King Edward VII attended the church service here and made a donation towards the clock fund. The War Memorial outside the church is of stone. The church also has an inscribed board with a further list of men. =The Lock-up= In Church Road, is an ironstone lock-up erected 1796, octagonal, with a pointed head to the doorway. It was used as a temporary place for stray animals or drunks, and its central pole, now removed, was used to chain prisoners in transit between Bedford and Luton. =Modern history= The village was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi The Millennium Green is a 4.94-hectare amenity space located off the High Street. Cranfield University landscape engineering students drew up designs in collaboration with residents of the village and won a grant of over ¬£45,000 to form the Green, a tranquil centrepiece for the village. As an integral part of the village, Cranfield University had also been invited to contribute to Silsoe Parish Council's Millennium Time Capsule which was placed there in March 2000. Governance The village has a Parish Council which has details of the Chair and meeting dates on its website. Silsoe is currently part of Central Bedfordshire Council for the ward of [Wrest]. Demography The 2001 Census showed 1,729 residents in the parish, 869 male and 860 female living in 620 dwellings. Over 130 of these are listed. This will have included a number of residents of Silsoe College, closed in 2007, the site of which has been redeveloped for housing and community use. Facilities The village has a small newsagent, hairdresser, one estate agents, one pub, lower school, nursery, drama society, dance school, sports centre and parish council.

Olympiodorus was the last pagan to maintain the Platonist tradition in Alexandria (see Alexandrian School); after his death the School passed into the hands of Christian Aristotelians, and was eventually moved to Constantinople. He is not to be confused with Olympiodorus the Deacon, a contemporary Alexandrian writer of Bible commentaries. Life Olympiodorus was the disciple of Ammonius Hermiae at the philosophy school in Alexandria, and succeeded him as its leader when Ammonius died c. 520. He was still teaching and writing in 565, because in his commentary on Aristotle's Meteorology, he mentions a comet that appeared that year. Olympiodorus himself was able to survive the persecution experienced by many of his peers (see, for example, Hierocles of Alexandria), possibly because the Alexandrian School was less involved in politics (for example, the attempts by the Emperor Julian to re-establish Mithraic cults) and also possibly because it was more scholastic and less religious than the Athenian Academy. He is called Olympiodorus the Younger or The Younger Olympiodorus in contemporary references because there was an earlier (5th century) Peripatetic philosopher also called Olympiodorus (Olympiodorus the Elder) who also taught in Alexandria. Writings Among the extant writings of Olympiodorus the Younger are a biography of Plato, commentaries on several dialogues of Plato and on Aristotle, and an introduction to Aristotelian philosophy. Olympiodorus also provides information on the work of the earlier Neoplatonist Iamblichus which is not found elsewhere. The surviving works are: *Commentary on Plato's Alcibiades (Œ£œáœåŒªŒπŒ± Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ†ŒªŒ¨œÑœâŒΩŒøœÇ ·ºàŒªŒ∫ŒπŒ≤ŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑ŒΩ) *Commentary on Plato's Gorgias (Œ£œáœåŒªŒπŒ± œÉ·Ω∫ŒΩ Œ∏Œµ·ø∑ Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒìŒøœÅŒ≥ŒØŒ±ŒΩ) *Commentary on Plato's Phaedo (Œ£œáœåŒªŒπŒ± Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ†ŒªŒ¨œÑœâŒΩŒøœÇ Œ¶Œ±ŒØŒ¥œâŒΩŒ±) *Life of Plato (ŒíŒØŒøœÇ Œ†ŒªŒ¨œÑœâŒΩŒøœÇ) *Introduction (Prolegomena) to Aristotle's logic (Œï·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∞ œÄœÅŒøŒªŒµŒ≥œåŒºŒµŒΩŒ± œÑ·øÜœÇ ŒõŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ) *Commentary on Aristotle's Meteorology (Œï·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ œÄœÅ·ø∂œÑŒøŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒúŒµœÑŒµœâœÅŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ∫·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ œÉœáœåŒªŒπŒ±) *Commentary on Aristotle's Categories (Œ£œáœåŒªŒπŒ± Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∞œÇ ·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ ŒöŒ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒØŒ±œÇ) *Commentary on Aristotle's On Interpretation (Œ£œáœåŒªŒπŒ± Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ·ºôœÅŒºŒ∑ŒΩŒµŒØŒ±œÇ) *a polemical work against Strato In addition, a Commentary by Olympiodorus is extant on Paulus Alexandrinus' Introduction to astrology (which was written in 378 AD). Although the manuscript of the Commentary is credited in two later versions to a Heliodorus, L. G. Westerink argues that it is actually the outline of a series of lectures given by Olympiodorus in Alexandria between May and July 564 AD. The Commentary is an informative expatiation of Paulus' tersely written text, elaborating on practices and sources. The Commentary also illuminates the developments in astrological theory in the 200 years after Paulus. Spurious works In addition there are three works ascribed to Olympiodorus, but which are now believed to be by other authors: * An alchemical treatise concerning Zosimus' On the Action, called On the Book Kat‚Äôenergeian (On the action or According to the action) by Zosimus and on the Sayings of Hermes and the Philosophers (Œï·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∫Œ±œÑ' ·ºêŒΩŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ ŒñœâœÉŒØŒºŒøœÖ, ·ΩÖœÉŒ± ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ ·ºôœÅŒºŒø·ø¶ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉœåœÜœâŒΩ ·º¶œÉŒ±ŒΩ Œµ·º∞œÅŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ±) * On the Divine and Sacred Art of the Philosophical Stone (Œ†ŒµœÅŒØ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·º±ŒµœÅ·æ∂œÇ œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑œÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ ŒªŒØŒ∏ŒøœÖ; Latin: De arte sacra lapidis philosophorum) * A commentary on Plato's Philebus ‚Äî now thought to be the work of Damascius Notes References * Olympiodorus, Introduction to Aristotle's Categories.

Bob Bindig (December 21, 1920 ‚Äì November 6, 2007) was a cartoonist and comics historian who worked on the Adventures of the Big Boy comic book from 1985 to 1995. Education In the late 1930s, Bindig attended the Buffalo Technical High School where he took a number of art classes.  Personal Life  Bindig was born in Buffalo, New York, but eventually moved to Orchard Park. He married Doris Krull in 1941, with whom he had five children, five grandchildren, and one great grandchild. As a hobby, he collected comic pages, of who he described as the \\"real greats\\". While deployed with the US Army, he sent letters to his wife, with colourful drawings on the envelopes that portrayed what he was doing or thinking. Career After high school, Bindig went to work for a local newspaper's art department in 1939. In 1943, while Bindig was creating test drawings to apply for a job at Walt Disney, he was drafted into the US Army. He joined the Medical Corps, and became the head of the art department, where he was assigned to illustrate military manuals and publications. In 1945, he was sent to the Philippines to illustrate propaganda leaflets. After WW2, he was placed in Korea. During his time there, he created a wordless comic strip titled \\"The Mischievous Twin Bears\\" for a local Korean newspaper. After returning to the USA, Bindig became an advertising artist, where he worked for firms such as Fisher-Price, Rich Products Corporation, and National Gypsum for ten years before choosing to become a freelancer. He also created the character of Buster Bison as the mascot for the AAA Buffalo Bisons baseball team. Bindig retired from his career in advertising in 1986. After his retirement, he took over \\"Adventures of the Big Boy\\". He drew for the series from 1985 to 1995, then retired a final time. Along with being an advertising art director, Bindig was also a comics historian who assisted the Dutch comic book store and art gallery Lambiek with numerous exhibitions. In 2000, the Library of Congress selected some of Bindig's work for the \\"Art of War\\" website, part of the Veterans History Project. Awards He received the National Cartoonist Society Advertising Illustration Award in 1988, and the San Diego Comic-Con Inkpot Award in 1982.  Death  Bindig passed away of unknown causes in the Sisters of Charity Hospital in Buffalo, on Wednesday, November 2007. He was 86. He was survived by his wife of 65 years, three sons, David, Terry and Mark; and two daughters, Wendy and Amy. His memorial service was held at 11 AM, in Orchard Park Presbyterian Church.

It produces corded and cordless power tools, hand tools, pliers, hand saws, cutters, screwdrivers, trims, knives, and tool combo kits. A Milwaukee tape measure In 1918, Milwaukee Tool introduced \\"the first lightweight portable, one-handed 1/4\\" capacity drill\\" the Hole-Shooter. The shooter was far more lightweight than comparable models weighing in at just five pounds.  History: Pre-Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation  A.H. Petersen gained a business partner by adding Albert F. Siebert to the business founding the A. H. Petersen tool company. Their production facility was destroyed by a fire in 1923 and the business went to public auction after closing shop due to the losses in the fire that destroyed their facility. In 1924, Seibert purchased the remaining assets and formed the Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation. His business goal at this time was to improve on the Hole-Shooter and repair other manufactures tools gaining ideas of what needed to be changed in order to increase the longevity of tools on the market at that time. Its instruments, such as compress meters, digital meters, levelling items, lighting testers, check and recognition pieces, temperature meters, thermal imaging items, and instruments for cutting, clipping, drilling and material elimination devices; chargers; and other products can be found worldwide.  A history of innovation  During the 1930s, Milwaukee achieved an equipment specification rating from the federal government and began producing all of its tools to the U.S. Navy standard of equipment. They also developed their own sanders, polishers, electric hammers, and hand grinders. The next major innovation that Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation brought to the table was a handheld 3/4 inch electric hammer drill with the ability to also act as a standard drill. Based on the market success of the new 3/4 inch hammer drill, a shorter, lighter, and more manageable hammer drill was soon introduced. The outbreak of World War II and the manufacturing boom that followed helped Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation become a major supplier for the U.S. Navy in part due to the Hole-Shooter being already designed to the Navy standard. During this time, Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation also added a spring clutch to their sanders and grinders which dramatically reduced the recoil in the units and was subsequently added to their line of circular saws. The next major advancement came with the introduction of the iconic Sawzall (reciprocating saw) in 1951. The Sawzall was the first in the industry to introduce a reciprocating mechanism to a portable hacksaw. The Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation also developed and manufactured a full line of blades for the new reciprocating saw to cut types of material including wood, soft metal, and hardened metal. ; Ownership history * 1924: The Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation was established by A.

Winch was leader of the British Columbia CCF from 1938 to 1953, and Leader of the Opposition from 1941. He was called \\"the best leader of the Opposition that has ever been\\" by Premier W. A. C. Bennett. Winch was active during the relief camp strike in Vancouver that precipitated the On-to-Ottawa Trek in 1935, acting as a liaison between unemployed protesters and the government. He performed the same role as a new MLA in 1938, and assisted the police in ending a month-long occupation at the Vancouver Art Gallery on what became known as \\"Bloody Sunday\\". Like other CCFers (such as Grace and Angus MacInnis), Winch and the BC CCF supported the internment of Japanese Canadians during World War II. Decades later, he conceded that this position was wrong. An electrician by trade, Winch joined the CCF at its founding. He was first elected to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly in the 1933 provincial election as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vancouver East. He became leader of the party following the 1937 general election and leader of the opposition in 1941. The CCF emerged from the 1952 provincial election with only one less seat than the British Columbia Social Credit Party. Social Credit formed a minority government, but was defeated in a motion of no confidence in March 1953. Winch opposed holding a new election, arguing that the CCF was able to form a new government. When the Liberal Party announced that it would not support a CCF government, a new election was called. Winch stepped down as party leader, and entered federal politics. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1953 federal election as the Member of Parliament for Vancouver East. Winch survived the 1958 federal election that almost wiped the CCF out, and remained with the party as it transformed into the New Democratic Party in 1961. After winning seven successive elections as an MP, he retired from the House of Commons at the 1972 federal election. Harold Winch's father, Ernest Edward Winch was also a CCF MLA from 1933 until his death in 1957.

It was co-written by S Club 7, Eliot Kennedy, Mike Percy and Tim Lever for the group's debut studio album S Club (1999). Kennedy, Percy and Lever also produced the song. It was released on 7 June 1999 as the album's lead single. Bring It All Back was used as the theme for the band's first CBBC series Miami 7 as well. Despite receiving a mixed reception from music critics, \\"Bring It All Back\\" was a massive chart success. It reached the top spot in the United Kingdom ‚Äì where it was certified Platinum ‚Äì and New Zealand, whilst also reaching the top ten in Sweden and Ireland. The song was released in North America on 28 September 1999, shortly before their television show Miami 7 became popular in the United States. It has sold 675,000 copies in the UK as of May 2015. In 2017, ShortList's Dave Fawbert listed 'Bring It All Back' as containing \\"one of the greatest key changes in music history\\". Song information \\"Bring It All Back\\" is notable for being the only S Club 7 single on which all four female members share lead vocals. The first verse is shared by Jo O'Meara and Rachel Stevens, while the second verse is split between Tina Barrett and Hannah Spearritt. Bradley McIntosh, Jon Lee and Paul Cattermole provide backing vocals and additional vocals on the final chorus. The single contains an extended version of the track with an additional refrain and chorus, as well as a club remix by K-Klass, which appears on all international versions of the single. The single also contains two B-sides, \\"So Right\\" and \\"Hello Friend\\". \\"So Right\\" features in the sixth episode of Miami 7, and as a bonus track on the Japanese version of the band's debut album, and is an up-tempo R&B; number. \\"Hello Friend\\", a ballad duet between O'Meara and Lee with additional backing vocals, was one of only three songs from the band's debut album era not performed during Miami 7, alongside \\"Our Time Has Come\\" and \\"Friday Night\\". However, it was later performed during Viva S Club to mark Cattermole's departure from the band. It was later added to the setlist of the Bring It All Back 2015 tour as an intimate duet between O'Meara and Lee. Music video Two music videos exist for the track. The first, recorded for use in the British and Australian markets, features newly recorded scenes of the band performing the track on a beach stage in Miami, recorded during the filming of Miami 7, as well as additional montage clips from several episodes of the series. The end of the video shows a group of people watching the band as the cameras pull away. Most notably, there are two beach stage scenes in the video that show Barrett with a different hairstyle compared to the rest of the video. The second video was recorded for use in the United States, and features scenes of the band performing the song in an American trailer park (recorded during the filming of the band's TV special Boyfriends and Birthdays), as well as in a courtroom, scenes taken from episode 10 of Miami 7, \\"Court in the Act\\". The video also features clips of the band performing the song poolside, which are taken from the opening credits of the series.

He has produced for artists such as Forrest and MC Miker G & DJ Sven and remixed tracks by artists such as Michael Jackson, Salt-N-Pepa, Sting, TLC, Fun Fun, Tavares, Bill Withers, Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons, George Aaron, Rick Astley, SWV and Phil Collins. He has also charted under his own name, an example of which was Ben Liebrand's version of \\"Eve of the War\\". His radio show \\"In The Mix\\" was the first non- stop mixed show that aired on Dutch National Radio in 1983. Early listeners were Armin van Buuren and Ti√´sto, who have cited Liebrand as their main reason for entering the music business. \\"In The Mix\\" also spawned an annual yearmix with 100+ tracks called \\"The Grandmix.\\" The first series of Grandmixes aired from 1983 to 1992 and later versions from 1999 on are also released on CD. Music career =Early history= Liebrand began his DJing career in 1976 at the age of 16 with his mobile set-up, \\"The B. Liebrand Audio Studio\\", playing parties around his hometown of Nijmegen. Two years later, when he became old enough to frequent nightclubs, he moved from mobile discos to a nightclub residency, playing in \\"Juicy Lucy\\" nightclub (1978‚Äì1979). At this point, he was still letting one record play into another without beatmixing; however in 1979, he began a residency at \\"The Kwien\\" (pronounced 'The Queen') nightclub (1979‚Äì1980). During this time, Liebrand learned the art of mixing from Kwien resident Huib Luiten. At his longest residency to date at \\"The Keizer Karel\\" (1980‚Äì1988) played a five-hour set each night after the club first opened. He continued DJing with his sister Rita Liebrand, at \\"The Hippodrome\\" Hennef, Germany (1990‚Äì1995). His last residency was in the club \\"Disco Inferno\\" (2000‚Äì2004). Ben is still active as a DJ having specialised in doing key-mixing on 4 Pioneer CD players simultaneously. =Radio Veronica early years= On 1 April 1983, Liebrand was hired by the Dutch radio station Radio Veronica, producing a weekly individual mix show called \\"In The Mix.\\" This one-hour show played at 2am weekly, and ran from early 1983 to November 1985. From that radio show, regular features such as the \\"Grandmix\\", a yearly mix of all important dance tracks of the year, was developed. Taking a full month to organise, mix and record, the first Grandmix was broadcast at the end of 1983, but technical complications almost ended this event before it started. Arriving at the Veronica Studio, Liebrand discovered that he had forgotten the second of the two tapes on which the Grandmix '83 was recorded. But he happened to have a tape of a just finished \\"High Fashion Dance Mix\\" with him, and it was with that tape that the second part of the Grandmix '83 began. In January 1984, the 'Grandmix '83' was broadcast in its entirety.\\"Grandmix\\" developed into a trademark event for both Radio Veronica and Liebrand, running until 1992. In 1984, Liebrand also started making shorter remixes for the Friday evening 'Curry & Van Inkel show', later the 'Stenders & Van Inkel show' (both on that station). His \\"In the Minimix\\" was always played at \\"two records past nine\\" (twee platen over negen) and formed an important part of the popular radioshow. These minimixes were either three/four track mixes (never exceeding fifteen minutes in total) or remixes of popular chart records at the time. Many of Liebrand's remixes, released as singles, including Bill Withers \\"Lovely Day\\" and Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons \\"December 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\\" were premiered as 'minimixes' on this radio show. In the case of Phil Collins \\"In The Air Tonight,\\" however, the mix was completed and then taken by Liebrand to be part of a mix showcase at the DMC Mixing Championship Finals in London. Liebrand explained \\"Then I put on my remix of Phil Collins, in front of those two and a half thousand DJ‚Äôs. And I told them: \\"If you want to see this released? Call Virgin first thing tomorrow!\\" That resulted in Virgin being called by two and a half thousand DJ's, and this got the track signed and released by 1pm the day after.\\" After producing the final \\"Grandmix\\" in 1992, Liebrand felt frustrated with lack of feedback that his mixes were gaining. \\"You didn‚Äôt know what people thought of it. 30 days fulltime working on the Grandmix in December, ten to twelve hours a day mixing. On 31 December it was finished, and the last years when I entered the broadcast studios, everybody was busy doing something else, not really interested, and only the technician who was on duty, sat with me in the broadcast room. I plugged in my gear, pressed play around six o‚Äôclock, and after an hour I disconnected it again, and took off. Having sat there for one hour, solely with the technician, it was the biggest anti-climax ever. This could be compared to making a piece of art, walking up to a bridge and throwing it in the river, without knowing the people‚Äôs opinions about it.\\" =Taking a break - visuals and adverts= Liebrand embarked on computer-based 3D renderings and animation work, beginning his own visual company, Liebrand Images. He undertook work such as commercials (for clients including Arcade Compilations CDs), promotional music videos (for acts including Atlantic Ocean and Alan Parsons) and visuals (station idents for Music TV station TMF). This company still operates today. =Return of The Grandmix‚Ä¶= In 1997, Liebrand released \\"Funky Town\\" and in 1998 began negotiations with Dutch radio-station Radio 538 (an offspring of Radio Veronica), the result of which was the re- broadcasting of all the Radio Veronica \\"Grandmixes\\" the last Saturday of the month throughout 1999. The final intention was to broadcast a brand-new \\"Grandmix\\" in December 1999, a \\"MillenniuM-Mix\\", containing the greatest dance tracks of the century. Liebrand was invited to produce a mid-year summer Grandmix and an end-of-year Grandmix for Radio 538. On 31 December 2001, a three-part \\"Grandmix\\" was broadcast, followed by a \\"Grandmix Disco Edition\\" on 23 August of that year. \\"Grandmixes\\" were broadcast in the summer and end-of- year of 2002 and 2003. In 2004, Liebrand returned to Radio Veronica for a two- hour weekly mix. He makes Grandmixes available in a new format on 3 CDs on his website and has his 'In The Mix' show on Radio Veronica. Until 2018 Grandmixes were available on CD every year. Due to licensing problems which occurred through changes in the music industry in 2019, there was no Grandmix available on CD in 2019. Instead Liebrand changed the concept to a three-hour (2:59:33) long mix called \\"Grandmix Decade Edition\\" which covers more than 250 songs of the years 2010-2019. It was broadcast on Radio 538 and Radio Calletti on 31 December 2019 from 18:00-21:00. Listeners have been very happy with this mix returning to the fast mixing style of the early days of Grandmix free of any licensing blockages using all available material to the artists choice. Personal life Liebrand is married to Brenda van Raam. They have two sons, Fabian and Sascha, and a daughter, Linde. Liebrand moved from The Netherlands to Canada in 2010.

Initially serving a dehqan in Sistan and the Muhtajids in Chaghaniyan, Farrukhi entered the service of the Ghaznavids in 1017, where he became the panegyrist of its rulers, Mahmud () and Mas'ud I (), as well as numerous viziers and princes.  Background  Farrukhi was born in in Sistan, a region in eastern Iran, which was then under Saffarid rule. His father Julugh was a high-ranking military slave (ghulam) of the Saffarid king Khalaf ibn Ahmad (). The origins of Julugh, as well as his name, is unclear. Regardless, Farrukhi grew up in a Muslim Persian-speaking environment, and was essentially a Persian. In 1003, the Saffarid dynasty was abolished by the Ghaznavid monarch Mahmud (), who made Sistan a Ghaznavid province.  Life  Medieval illustration of Mahmud of Ghazni and his court According to the tadhkirahs, Farrukhi was talented from an early age in poetry and playing the lute. During his youth, he used these skills to serve a landowner (dehqan), but due to insufficient salary, he left Sistan to seek his fortunes in Transoxiana, where he in the autumn of 1016 entered the service of the Muhtajid prince Abu'l-Muzaffar Fakhr al-Dawla Ahmad ibn Muhammad, who ruled Chaghaniyan as a vassal of the Ghaznavids. During the Mehregan festival, Farrukhi composed a poem for Abu'l-Muzaffar. However, hardly a year later, Farrukhi left for the Ghaznavid capital of Ghazni, where he joined the court of Mahmud, eventually becoming his panegyrist. It was at Ghazni that Farrukhi reached his goal of renown and riches. Farrukhi continued to hold a strong love for his homeland Sistan, even though he would never live there again. He seemingly visited the place from time to time, and still kept touch with relatives and friends. In 1027, he composed a poem for the Ghaznavid vizier Hasanak, applauding the latter for improving the conditions of Sistan, which had been in a state of chaos after Mahmud's brutal conquest in 1003. However, this was only temporary; many Sistanis continued to dislike the Ghaznavids and the heavy taxes they imposed on them. According to the Tarikh-i Sistan‚Äîwhose author was staunchly pro-Saffarid‚Äîthe start of Ghaznavid rule was the \\"beginning of calamity for Sistan.\\" In 1030, Mahmud was forced to step in, appointing the Saffarid prince Taj al-Din I Abu'l-Fadl Nasr as the vassal ruler of Sistan, marking the start of the Nasrid dynasty. Farrukhi also served as the panegyrist of Mahmud's son and second successor Mas'ud I (), as well as numerous viziers and princes. He died in Ghazni in . According to the Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"he was one of the most successful court poets in the history of Persian literature.\\" He was present in the Ghaznavid court during the apex of the empire under Mahmud. His poems celebrate various court events, such as the Iranian festivals of Mihragan, Nowruz, and Sadeh, and the Islamic Eid al-Fitr, as well as Mahmud's famous raid on the temple of Somnath (S≈´mnƒÅt) in Gujarat in 1026.  Works  Farrukhi's surviving works consist mainly of his divan (collection of poems), which number about 9,000 couplets. A document in the Bankipore Library refers to Farrukhi as the author of an epic poem, the Shahriyarnameh: this is yet to be confirmed.

Two were black-and- white comics-magazine anthologies published by Marvel Comics, and the other a color comic book anthology published by Dynamite Entertainment. Publication history =Marvel= The first of the two volumes of Savage Tales ran 11 issues, with a nearly 2-year hiatus after the premiere issue (May 1971, then Oct. 1973 - July 1975). It marked Marvel's second attempt at entering the comics-magazine field dominated by Warren Publishing (Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella), following the two-issue superhero entry The Spectacular Spider- Man in 1968. Starring in the first issue were: * Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery pulp-fiction character Conan the Barbarian, adapted by writer Roy Thomas and artist Barry Windsor-Smith (as Barry Smith) * the futuristic, Amazon-like Femizons, by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist John Romita * the first-ever appearance of the swamp creature Man-Thing, plotted by Lee and Thomas, scripted by Gerry Conway and drawn by Gray Morrow * the African- American inner-city defender Joshua, in the feature \\"Black Brother\\" by Dennis O'Neil (under the pseudonym Sergius O'Shaughnessy) and penciler Gene Colan * the jungle lord Ka-Zar, by Lee and artist John Buscema.Savage Tales #1 at the Grand Comics Database Thomas, who would shortly thereafter become Marvel editor-in-chief, recalled in 2008 that When the magazine eventually began publishing again years later (after Goodman had left the company) in the wake of a Conan-inspired sword-and-sorcery trend in comics, it starred the likes of Conan; fellow Robert E. Howard hero Kull of Atlantis; and John Jakes' barbarian creation, Brak. As of issue #6, the magazine cover-featured Ka-Zar. The series featured painted covers by comics artists including John Buscema (#1-2), Pablo Marcos & John Romita (#3), Neal Adams (#4-6), Boris Vallejo (#7, #10), and Michael Kaluta (#9). A 1975 annual, consisting entirely of reprints, mostly from Ka-Zar's color-comics series, sported a new cover by Ken Barr. Volume 2 ran eight issues (Oct 1985 - Dec. 1986). It featured adventure and action stories with a military fiction slant. Stories in the first and fourth issues, a feature called \\"5th to the 1st\\" by writer Doug Murray and artist Michael Golden, were the forerunners of the duo's color-comics series The 'Nam. =Dynamite Entertainment= In 2007 American publisher Dynamite Entertainment started a new Savage Tales, a color comic book sword and sorcery anthology starring the character Red Sonja.Biggers, Cliff. \\"Exploring Dynamite's Savage Tales\\", Comic Shop News via Newsarama, January 8, 2007.

Cagle Cartoons is a \\"package service\\" where subscribing publications receive all of the content and can reprint whatever they choose. = Mexican Flag cartoon = Daryl Cagle's controversial Mexican flag cartoon In September 2010, Cagle published a cartoon showing the Mexican flag, whose coat of arms normally depicts an eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus devouring a snake, dead in a pool of blood, with the flag itself riddled with bullet holes. The cartoon drew criticism after running on the front pages of many Mexican newspapers. Many outraged Mexican readers pointed out that it is against the law in Mexico to alter the image of the flag ‚Äì a law that did not deter Mexican newspapers from printing the cartoon. Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said that \\"as any democratic society, Mexico respects and defends freedom of speech and freedom of expression, in any way it's manifested. Regarding the case of Mr. Cagle's cartoon, we differ on the use he makes of the Mexican flag and the message it conveys.\\" \\"It is the role of editorial cartoonists to criticize governments and nations, and to use the symbols of nations in our cartoons,\\" Cagle wrote in response to the outrage. \\"Cartoonists all around the world use flags in their cartoons and no country can opt out of criticism because they view their own flag as \\"sacred\\". This attitude outrages my Mexican critics, especially since it comes from an ugly, foreign, American cartoonist.\\" =International travel= John Kudryavtsev and Daryl Cagle at the 2010 opening of \\"Reflections of Life: Cartoons for Adults...\\" at the Arka Gallery in Vladivostok, Russia For the U.S. State Department Cagle traveled to Vladivostok in December 2010, where he participated in a joint exhibition with Russian political cartoonist John Kudryavtsev.

It was written in 1982 and published in the next year. In 2012 a revised \\"New Millennium Edition\\" was published.New Millennium Edition page at Diane Duane's bookstore The plot follows Nita Callahan, a thirteen-year-old girl who discovers a book titled So You Want to Be a Wizard while hiding from bullies in a library. She brings the book home with her and discovers that it is about the art of wizardry. She does not completely trust the book's claim that she can become a wizard if she takes the Wizard Oath, but she takes it nonetheless. The next day when she is out trying to do her first spell she meets Kit Rodriguez, another wizard. After they successfully complete a spell together, Nita's doubts are gone: she is a wizard. Plot Nita Callahan, taking refuge in the library from bullies, checks out a book found in the children's section with the provocative title So You Want To Be a Wizard. On the way home, the bullies corner her, beat her up, and take a space pen given to her by her uncle. Before Nita goes to sleep, she takes the Wizard's Oath. The next morning she looks at her manual and sees her name in the wizards list. She goes to a quiet place to work a pen retrieval spell, and meets Christopher \\"Kit\\" Rodriguez, also a new wizard. Kit is making a spell intended to surround him with an aura of fearlessness. Combining their intentions, they create a new spell, which presents a vision of an alternate Manhattan: polluted, lightless, and frightening. A terrible being composed of pure desire reaches up to consume them, and to escape, they open their minds to the universe - which ends up bringing an intelligent white hole from space. Translated into English and simplified, the white hole's name is \\"Fred\\". The next day at school Fred and Nita attempt to retrieve Nita's pen from her bullies, but Fred miscalculates the gravity required to lift the pen from the bullies' possession, and instead accidentally swallows it. This makes Fred hiccup objects, including a television, a blue Mercedes, and a Learjet. After school, they seek help from the local Advisory Wizards. Fred's problem is fixed, but Nita's pen is not recovered. In order to retrieve it, they must link Fred to a worldgate in Grand Central Station and pull the pen out of Fred. Fred also has some alarming news: a crucial book has gone missing. Called the Naming of Lights, it is a compendium of information that describes the true nature of everything that has or will exist. It is also known as The Book of Night with Moon because it can only be read by moonlight. Its shadow, The Book Which is Not Named, contains descriptions that are twisted out of their true patterns. If the Lone Power - the being of desire and hate sensed by Nita and Kit - were to read the shadow Book without the bright Book being read, the cosmos would be irreparably skewed. In Grand Central, Nita and Kit find that the worldgate has been knocked out of place and is hovering above the station. Nita invokes the air to solidify into a walkway between the roof of the Pan Am Building and the gate, but before Nita can retrieve her pen, a pack of werewolf-analogues attack, causing Nita, Kit, and Fred to plunge through the worldgate. On the other side, Nita's pen is lying on the floor of a building in an alternate New York City. The landscape is cold, dark and lifeless, populated by predators. Many resemble automobiles, but there are also glowing-eyed dun mice, batlike skinwings, and dragonlike fireworms. This world belongs to the Lone Power, a thing far worse than any devil and more ancient than the earth. Nita, Kit, and Fred learn that the two Books are here, and that to get home they will have to read from the bright Book. To find the bright Book, they decide to steal the dark Book from the Lone Power, because they need the Bright Book's power to find the worldgate, which has been hidden in the darkness that the Lone Power has created. On their way to the Lone Power's office, Kit finds a racing car, a Lotus Esprit, beside its prey, a \\"dead\\" sedan, injured by a piece of metal lodged in its axle. Kit cuts this piece away, and the Lotus roars off, free. Inside the building, Nita, Kit, and Fred eavesdrop on the Lone Power's phone call to the Archangel Michael. Michael suspects his brother stole the bright Book, while the Lone Power suspects him of sending Nita and Kit to steal it back. Nita and Kit have not previously considered this, but it begins to make sense. Old City Hall subway platformNita steals the dark Book, and uses it to locate the bright Book in the tunnels under City Hall. Aided by the Lotus Esprit, who has returned to show its gratitude, they proceed to the tunnels, where they discover the Book is guarded by the Eldest of the fireworms. The Eldest - a dragon-like fire-breathing lizard - lies on a vast hoard of stolen gold, gems, silver plate, plastic toys, coins, and bones. The wizards bargain with the Eldest, giving it the dark Book in exchange for the bright Book, in addition to securing the hoard with a magical barrier. The enraged Lone Power comes after them on the back of an eight-legged, skull-faced beast. They flee through the worldgate, and re-enter their homeworld with the Lone Power on their heels. To stop the Lone Power from destroying their Universe, Kit and Nita quickly enlist a wall of magically animated trees and statues around a refuge in Central Park, and begin to read from the bright Book by moonlight, to undo the changes that the Lone Power has been making during the pursuit. The Lone Power then puts out the Sun, extinguishing the moonlight that is necessary to read from the Book. Fred sacrifices himself by \\"blowing his quanta\\", releasing all his mass as energy in the form of visible light, which, reflected by the moon, becomes moonlight by which the Wizards can continue reading. As Kit and Nita recite the Lone Power's true name, written in the bright Book, Nita makes a slight modification to the text (the symbol ‚éã), giving the Lone Power the option to become a positive rather than a negative energy. Renamed and vanquished, the Lone Power withdraws. Nita and Kit go home, their Ordeal complete. Characters in \\"So You Want to Be a Wizard\\" =Major Characters= Juanita \\"Nita\\" Louise Callahan is one of the protagonists in this story. Nita is a lonely thirteen-year-old and does not have many friends. When she discovers a book about wizardry, her life is completely changed. She becomes friends with Kit Rodriguez, another newly minted wizard. Together they find themselves caught up in their wizard ordeal. Nita is gifted in working with the \\"living world\\" in wizardry. Christopher \\"Kit\\" K. Rodriguez is one of the protagonists in this story. He is another wizard and partner to Nita. Small for his age and picked on for his Spanish accent, Kit discovers his wizard's manual in a used book store. Soon after taking his Wizard's Oath he meets up with Nita, and together they are thrown into their ordeal that they must complete to become full wizards. Kit is usually the more mature of the team, despite being younger than Nita. His skill is in working with mechanical objects. Fred is a white hole that Nita and Kit accidentally bring down to Earth from space when working their first spell together. His full name when translated to English is \\"Khairelikoblepharehglukumeilichephreidosd'enagouni\\", but he agreed to go by \\"Fred\\" (from the syllable \\"phreid\\"). When he accidentally swallows Nita's pen, he gets an unfortunate case of the \\"hiccups\\", emitting objects such as televisions and airplanes instead of radiation and particles. Fred accompanies Nita and Kit on their ordeal, giving them useful information such as who the Lone Power is. Near the end of the story, Fred sacrifices himself in order to provide Nita and Kit with moonlight so they may continue reading from the Bright Book to save their lives, along with all the people on Earth. The Lone Power, also known as \\"The Lone One\\" and \\"Starsnuffer\\", is the main antagonist in the story. Nita and Kit must defeat him in order to complete their ordeals and become full wizards; if they fail, they will most likely die. The Lone One is one of the Powers That Be, but one who went away from the path of good that was intended for the universe, and instead created death. The \\"Other Manhattan\\" is his world. Other names for him, coming from the other books, are the \\"Kindler of Wildfires\\" and \\"Relegate\\". =Minor Characters= Tom Swale Carl Romeo Dairine Callahan Mr. and Mrs. Callahan Major themes One of the major themes in So You Want to Be a Wizard is the ability to extend sympathy and understanding to anyone, even enemies.Review: So You Want to Be a Wizard by Diane Duane One excellent example of this takes place in the Other Manhattan. In this world, cars are alive, and when a Lotus Esprit kills another car, its prey, a piece of metal gets stuck in it. Upon finding the injured Esprit, Kit cuts out the piece of metal and the car zooms away. Later, when Nita, Kit, and Fred are attempting to find the dark book, the Esprit returns and offers the three of them a ride. It proceeds to assist them in finding the book and in protecting them from the Lone One. This example shows how by offering sympathy and assistance to the car, who was originally Kit's enemy and would have attacked if it could, Kit received kindness in return. Another theme is the balance between good and evil. In an interview with Harcourt Books, Duane writes > The issues of the choice between right and wrong has to be an ongoing > concern for everybody, at every age. There is no magical point in a human > life when anyone is or becomes immune to the second-by-second choice to do > right instead of wrong.

Early life and education Burgess was born in Manchester. Career In 1981, Burgess (ex-the Cliches) formed the Chameleons with guitarists Dave Fielding and Reg Smithies, and drummer John Lever. After three full-length albums, the band split up in 1987, with the relationship between Burgess and Fielding particularly strained. Burgess and Lever then formed the Sun and the Moon with guitarists Andy Clegg, who had played keyboards with the Chameleons and Andy Whitaker. They released an eponymous 1988 album on Geffen Records before splitting up. In 1993, Burgess released his first solo album (under the name Mark Burgess & the Sons of God), Zima Junction, backed by former Wonky Alice guitarist Yves Altana, among others. In 1994, Burgess and Altana released the album Paradyning. In 1997, Burgess and Altana formed Invincible, recording the album Venus with drummer Geoff Walker in a water tower in North Manchester. The group toured the UK in 1998 with Phil Cuthbert playing bass and keyboards. Following the tour, Cuthbert left the group to pursue a solo career, at which point Burgess took over on bass, and Danny Ashberry was recruited to fill the keyboard-backing vocal role. After several concerts, Walker was replaced by drummer Craig Barrie. Upon the album's release in 1999, Invincible embarked on a UK tour, before the band disintegrated. In 2000, the Chameleons reunited with all four original members, originally for several live performances in England. They eventually added Ghana-born percussionist- vocalist Kwasi Asante, releasing several live albums and one new studio recording, Why Call It Anything, and toured North America, before an acrimonious break-up in early 2003. Burgess and Altana next formed the band Bird, initially with Barrie on drums (supporting New Model Army on their UK tour). In 2006, they enlisted drummer Achim Faerber, playing a selection of Invincible and Chameleons songs interwoven with a selection of new material. In November 2006, Bird played a short set at the Middleton Civic Hall in Manchester as part of a benefit concert for lighting technician and ex- Chameleons live keyboard player Andy Moore, who had been diagnosed with a brain tumour while touring with Jamie Cullum. Moore died one year later, in November 2007. In 2007, Burgess joined with Jack Sobel and John Kolbeck, formerly of the Messengers, to form Black Swan Lane. Augmented by former Burgess bandmates Altana and Faerber, Asante, and guest vocalist Anna-Lynne Williams (Trespassers William), they soon recorded A Long Way From Home, issued on Eden Records. One of the album tracks, \\"In the Ether\\", was later featured in 2009 film Adventureland. In November 2008, Burgess, Sobel, Clegg and Whitaker performed a one-off concert as the Sun and the Moon in Atlanta, Georgia. During the rehearsals for this show, Clegg and Whitaker became involved in the writing and recording of the second Black Swan Lane album, The Sun and the Moon Sessions. Asante and Burgess friend Jimmy Oakes also contributed to the album, issued in June 2009. In 2007, a Burgess autobiography, View from a Hill, was published by the independent Guardian Angel press. In April 2015, it was reprinted in a re-edited and revised \\"definitive\\" edition by Mittens On. Mittens On In November 2009, a five-song EP with producer Pocket was released, featuring two songs, \\"A Force of Nature\\" and \\"Heaven,\\" with lyrics and lead vocals by Burgess. In 2009, Burgess reunited with Lever under the name ChameleonsVox, performing and touring Chameleons back catalogue material. As ChameleonsVox, Burgess toured the United States and Europe from 2009 to 2014, performing acoustic and full band shows with varying backing musicians, including Lever. They issued an EP, M+D=1(8), in November 2013, prior to Lever's departure. Lever died in 2017. A ChameleonsVox line-up featuring Burgess and Altana with Neil Dwerryhouse and Chris Oliver on guitars embarked on a \\"We Are All Chameleons Farewell Tour\\" in the US in 2015. In 2016, Burgess contributed guest vocals to \\"On the Inside\\", a track from the album Choke by Portland, Oregon, post-punk band Soft Kill. In 2017 and 2018 ChameleonsVox continued to tour with concerts throughout Europe and America; their latest concerts have centred on the songs from one of their three original albums. \\"Mark‚Äôs bass playing was stellar and inspired.

The series was produced by Dick Powell's Four Star Television and filmed at the Desilu-Culver Studio. Trackdown was a spin-off of Powell's anthology series, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater. Synopsis Trackdown stars Robert Culp as Texas Ranger Hoby Gilman. It is set in the 1870s after the American Civil War. In early episodes, stories focused on Gilman going to different Texas towns in pursuit of wanted fugitives. At midseason, the series became set in the town of Porter, Texas. Episodes touched on multiple Western themes and topics, so it was known as \\"the thinking man's Western.\\" Gilman is the de facto sheriff in Porter. His friends in the town include Henrietta Porter, portrayed by Ellen Corby (who later played Esther Walton on CBS's The Waltons). She is the widow of the town's founder and owns The Porter Enterprise newspaper. Occasionally, his duties as a Texas Ranger took him out of town, where he used his fast gun to \\"track down\\" and apprehend wanted criminals throughout the Lone Star State. The pilot episode, \\"Badge of Honor\\", directed by Arthur Hiller, aired on Zane Grey Theater on May 3, 1957. Gilman, then an ex-Confederate cavalry officer, returns to his Central Texas hometown called \\"Crawford\\" after the war. He finds the town under the ruthless control of a gang led by an ex-Confederate colonel, Boyd Nelson, played by Gary Merrill. The town sheriff, portrayed by The Lineup star Tom Tully, is a drunken shell of the man whom Gilman had once known, who is afraid to face the outlaws. When a Texas Ranger came to arrest Colonel Nelson, he is fatally shot in the back. His Ranger badge falls on the dusty road. Gilman, who previously served with the Texas Rangers, was weary of the Civil War and did not want to continue as a lawman, but after learning of the Ranger's death, he picked up the badge and finished the job of bringing Nelson and his gang to justice. Trackdown carried the endorsement of both the State of Texas and the Texas Rangers, an accolade no other Western television series has received. Some episodes were inspired by the files of the Rangers.

Both series were presented in half- hour episodes and filmed in black and white. McQueen also appeared in a May 1958 episode of Trackdown titled \\"The Brothers\\", in which he played a dual role. =Production notes= All Trackdown episodes were produced by Vincent Fennelly. John Robinson wrote 14 segments, including the pilot. Richard Donner was one of the directors. Sam Peckinpah wrote one episode, \\"The Town\\", about a cowardly community afraid to resist the clutches of an outlaw gang, but he did not direct any Trackdown episodes. Robert Culp wrote one episode titled \\"Back To Crawford\\", which featured his then-wife, Nancy Asch-Culp. This episode was directly related to the first regular series episode, \\"The Marple Brothers\\", as Nancy portrayed a former childhood friend of Hoby's, Merrilee Quintana, with whom Hoby was once in love, who was out to kill his sister Norah as revenge for his killing her young husband in the line of duty, who was one of the evil Marple Brothers that he encountered in episode one. His sister was played by actress Peggy Webber, reprising her role from the series pilot. She went on to guest-star in \\"Child Out of Time\\", an episode of Culp's series I Spy a few years later. In an interview, Robert Culp stated that Trackdown was conceived by its creators as \\"the Western Dragnet\\". The pilot of the series was written by John Robinson, who according to Culp in that same interview, was partly responsible for the creation of Dragnet along with that series' star, Jack Webb. It was this series, Trackdown, that first brought Culp to national public attention, eight years before he starred with Bill Cosby in I Spy. The series narrator was character actor Ed Prentiss .http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Trackdown_RobertCulp.htm Hoby Gilman's use of the Smith & Wesson .44 Schofield revolver instead of the more-popular Colt Peacemaker is also notable. Syndicated reruns of this series have been broadcast in the early 2000s on TV Land and other cable networks. CBS Television Distribution now has the TV distribution rights to Trackdown due to CBS's ownership of the show via its co-production with Four Star.

Several women therefore carried the empress titles during his late reign, either entirely simultaneously or in an overlapping manner, and four of them survived to the time of the brief reign of his son Liu Can in 318. Liu Can was said to have engaged in affairs with all of them (which was considered incest under Chinese tradition, even though he had no blood relations with them), all of whom were described as younger than 20 in age. In addition to these empresses with formal titles, Liu Cong was said to have had several other consorts who also carried empress seals, but not official empress titles. Jin Yueguang Jin Yueguang (Èù≥ÊúàÂÖâ) was Jin Zhun's daughter, and she became a consort of Liu Cong's in 315, along with her sister Jin Yuehua, and was created \\"Upper Empress\\" (‰∏äÁöáÂêé). She was described to be extremely beautiful. Later that year, Liu Cong's official Chen Yuanda (Èô≥ÂÖÉÈÅî) revealed that she had an affair, and Liu Cong felt that he had no choice but to depose her. She committed suicide in shame, and Liu Cong, missing her beauty, became resentful of Chen from that point on. Left Empress Liu Left Empress Liu (ÂäâÂ∑¶ÁöáÂêé, personal name unknown) was likely a granddaughter of the respected Han Zhao official Liu Yin (ÂäâÊÆ∑) and niece of Empress Liu E. She was created \\"Left Empress\\" in 315, and nothing further is known about her. She was not mentioned when Liu Can became emperor in 318, and Liu Cong had earlier in 318 created another Left Empress, implying that she was dead by that point. Jin Yuehua Jin Yuehua (Èù≥ÊúàËèØ) was Jin Zhun's daughter, and she became a consort of Liu Cong's in 315, along with her sister Jin Yueguang, and was created \\"Right Empress\\" (Âè≥ÁöáÂêé). She was described to be extremely beautiful. She survived to Liu Can's reign in 318, when Liu Can honored her as empress dowager. It is not known what her fate was after her father Jin Zhun overthrew Liu Can later in 318 and was subsequently assassinated and succeeded by his cousin Jin Ming (Èù≥Êòé), who, along with the entire Jin clan, was massacred by the succeeding emperor Liu Yao. Upper Empress Fan Upper Empress Fan (Ê®ä‰∏äÁöáÂêé, personal name unknown) was a servant girl of Liu Cong's second wife Empress Zhang Huiguang. She was created \\"Upper Empress\\" in 316. When Liu Can became emperor in 318, he honored her as \\"Empress Hongdao\\" (ÂºòÈÅìÁöáÂêé). Left Empress Wang Left Empress Wang (ÁéãÂ∑¶ÁöáÂêé, personal name unknown) was an adopted daughter of the eunuch Wang Chen (ÁéãÊ≤à), a trusted but corrupt assistant to Liu Cong. Several officials tried to persuade him from creating a eunuch's adopted daughter (whom they saw as no higher, social station-wise, than a servant girl) an empress, and they were executed for their opposition. When Liu Cong died later that year and was succeeded by Liu Can, she was honored as \\"Empress Hongxiao\\" (ÂºòÂ≠ùÁöáÂêé). Middle Empress Xuan Middle Empress Xuan (ÂÆ£‰∏≠ÁöáÂêé, personal name unknown) was an adopted daughter of the eunuch Xuan Huai (ÂÆ£Êá∑), a trusted but corrupt assistant to Liu Cong. She was created \\"Middle Empress\\" in 318 after Liu Cong had already executed several officials over his creating Left Empress Wang, and so she appeared to have received no additional opposition. When Liu Cong died later that year and was succeeded by Liu Can, she was honored as \\"Empress Hongde\\" (ÂºòÂæ∑ÁöáÂêé).

Grossack (1956 ‚Äì September 20, 2017) was an attorney, writer, and former activist born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the son of noted psychotherapist and author Dr. Martin Grossack and Judith Grossack. David was named one of the state's ten best lawyers by the Boston Herald, and received a coveted \\"Lawyer of the Year\\" award from Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly. Education David Grossack was educated at Thayer Academy, Brandeis University, Babson College (where he received a B.S. in Management in 1976), and the New England School of Law, where he was awarded a Juris Doctor in 1981. Early political career As a young law student, Grossack was influenced by the activities of Andrew Melechinsky, who was active in an organization known as Constitutional Revival. Constitutional Revival stood for the proposition that the federal constitution is the blueprint for a laissez faire, private enterprise society in which the role of government is limited, and that courts are in error for not taking measures to limit the excesses of administrative agencies, zoning boards, and similar bodies. The organization had several confrontations over property rights and building inspections. Grossack acted as stand-by counsel for Melechinsky on several occasions. Grossack, at the age of 25, represented a member of Constitutional Revival in an action to quash an Internal Revenue Service third party summons by using discovery pleadings. The action was so successful that Congress altered the means by which taxpayers could object to the IRS subpoenaing third party records. Career Grossack soon had another opportunity to stand up for constitutional rights. When Israeli Knesset member and Jewish Defense League founder Rabbi Meir Kahane came to speak at a local high school in Brookline, Massachusetts, the town requested that his local supporters post a \\"security bond\\" to cover expenses resulting from the anticipated confrontation with opponents. Grossack made news by threatening the town of Brookline with a lawsuit for violating Kahane's First Amendment rights. Brookline backed down, and Kahane spoke at the High School. Grossack was active in advocating the free emigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and Arab countries. In 1985, Grossack was named Professor of Civil Procedure at the Commonwealth School of Law, which has since been absorbed by the Massachusetts School of Law. =Authorship= In 1998, Grossack authored a book entitled How To Win A Lawsuit Without Hiring A Lawyer, which explained in great detail many of the aspects of legal self-representation., especially in civil rights cases. Shortly thereafter, he wrote another book entitled Radical Planet, in which he advocated a number of social and economic changes in the United States and internationally, including the introduction of a new currency he invented called Universal Trade Hours, based on the value of time and labor. The book also fully details the methods by which activists can advance their causes, and puts forth the hypothesis that there are advantages to one's emotional well-being through pursuing activism. =Massachusetts legislature= In 1998, the Massachusetts legislature began an investigation of the situation of unrepresented parties in Massachusetts courts. Grossack arranged for local legislators to introduce a bill into the Massachusetts House of Representatives to establish reading rooms and web sites for the instruction of pro se litigants in the state's court houses. Shortly thereafter, the Suffolk County Probate and Family Court in Boston established the first of such reading rooms. =International news= Grossack made international news the same year. His Citizens Justice Institute brought exorcist Baron Deacon to Washington, D.C. to \\"cleanse demons from Congress.\\" [6] The exorcist performed a ritual on the steps of Capitol Hill in front of tourists, reporters, TV cameras and other onlookers. The event made headlines in several countries and was picked up on television and wire services. =Fatherhood Coalition= The following year, Grossack was hired by the Fatherhood Coalition to challenge the treatment of males in the Massachusetts court system, most particularly with regard to domestic relations matters. Grossack, on behalf of his clients, charged that the courts violated men's rights by removing them from their homes without a hearing on flimsy allegations of spousal abuse. Grossack's civil rights suit also alleged that property, alimony and custody decisions were usually biased against men. The lawsuit gathered significant publicity, though it was ultimately unsuccessful. [2] =Rabbinical Court Case= In March 2008, Grossack instituted a complaint with the Vaad HaRabonim, a Massachusetts Jewish ecclesiastical court, against a foreclosure law firm, based on violations of Talmudic law concerning oppression of the poor. Grossack sought excommunication of the lawyers involved. The firm was seeking to evict an elderly couple in Rockland, Massachusetts who had a mortgage at 16% that had been assumed by Fannie Mae. Grossack's concern in the situation was motivated in large part by objections he had to usury. He followed up his complaint with information that the actions of the foreclosure lawyer Mark Harmon led to the suicide of a woman in New Bedford, but nevertheless the Vaad took no action. =Experimental global currency= In 1996, Grossack invented an experimental global currency known as the Universal Trade Hour, a currency based on time and labor. He found a warm reception with Terra Libra, a libertarian think tank based in Colorado, who assisted him in publicizing and promoting the currency. Currently, Universal Trade Hours are not in circulation, but Grossack has been seeking to influence NGOs in less developed countries to consider experimenting with the concept.

Gen. Jubal Early's independent command during the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns in the summer and autumn of 1864. The Army of the Valley was the last Confederate unit to invade Northern territory, reaching the outskirts of Washington, D.C.. The Army became defunct after its decisive defeat at the Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia, on March 2, 1865. History General Robert E. Lee, entrenched at Petersburg, wanted to siphon off some of the overwhelming number of Federal troops that he faced. He was also concerned with recent Union victories in the Shenandoah Valley (a vital source of supplies and food for his army). He devised a daring plan to accomplish both ends. On June 12, 1864, Lee ordered Jubal Early to take independent command of the Army of Northern Virginia's Second Corps, renaming it as the Army of the Valley (the name given to many of these same troops by Stonewall Jackson during his 1862 Valley Campaign). Early was to march north through the Shenandoah Valley, cross the Potomac River into Maryland, and possibly threaten either Baltimore or Washington. Early immediately made preparations for independent action. Departing Petersburg via train, the army arrived in the valley at the rail center of Lynchburg to reinforce John C. Breckinridge and to contest the Federals in the region. However, David Hunter withdrew his Union troops in the face of Early's larger force. Readily brushing aside the remaining small Federal garrisons in a series of minor engagements, Early (with Breckinridge's men now a part of the Army of the Valley) proceeded northward and then east from the valley across the South Mountain range. Near Frederick, Maryland, the force was delayed by a full day at the Battle of Monocacy by Lew Wallace. On July 11, Early threatened Washington before withdrawing two days later. On July 24, after returning to the Shenandoah, the Army of the Valley won its last major battle, Second Kernstown, defeating George Crook's VIII Corps. Early dispatched much of his cavalry under John McCausland to raid and subsequently burn much of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania (in apparent retaliation for Hunter's burning of the Virginia Military Institute). By the end of July, fed up with Early's free rein of the valley, President Abraham Lincoln met with Ulysses S. Grant to discuss options. Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan was assigned to command, replacing the defeated Hunter, who promptly resigned. In a series of sharp engagements in August through October, Sheridan repeatedly defeated the Army of the Valley and drove Early's men southward. The Army of the Valley was no longer a significant threat. Early's battered force stayed together throughout the winter of 1864-65, but was a shadow of its former size and potency. Many men deserted and returned home. The remainder were low on supplies, ammunition, clothing, and food, yet maintained a military presence. However, on February 27, 1865, Sheridan departed Winchester with two cavalry divisions and moved into position to attack Early near Waynesboro with the division commanded by Major General George Armstrong Custer. After a brief stand-off, a determined Federal attack rolled up Early's exposed right flank and scattered his small force. General Early and a few other officers and troops were able to avoid capture, but over 1,500 men were captured and sent to Fort Delaware to await the end of the war. The Army of the Valley ceased to exist and Lee dismissed Early from the service, fearing that he could not instill enough confidence in the new recruits required to keep the fighting going.

Soldaderas, often called Adelitas, were women in the military who participated in the conflict of the Mexican Revolution, ranging from commanding officers to combatants to camp followers.Gabriela Cano, \\"Soldaderas and Coronelas\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 1, pp. 1357-1360. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997. \\"In many respects, the Mexican revolution was not only a men's but a women's revolution.\\"Friedrich Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1998, p. 290. Although some revolutionary women achieved officer status, coronelas, \\"there are no reports of a woman achieving the rank of general.\\"Cano, \\"Soldaderas and Coronelas\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, p. 1359. Since revolutionary armies did not have formal ranks, some women officers were called generala or coronela, even though they commanded relatively few men.Cano, \\"Soldaderas and Coronelas\\", p. 1359. A number of women took male identities, dressing as men, and being called by the male version of their given name, among them √Ångel Jim√©nez and Amelio Robles √Åvila. The largest numbers of soldaderas were in Northern Mexico, where both the Federal Army (until its demise in 1914) and the revolutionary armies needed them to provision soldiers by obtaining and cooking food, nursing the wounded, and promoting social cohesion.Cano, \\"Soldaderas and Coronelas\\", p. 1358.Frazer, Competing Voices from the Mexican Revolution: Fighting Words, 151. In area of Morelos where Emiliano Zapata led revolutionary campesinos, the forces were primarily defensive and based in peasant villages, less like the organized armies of movement of Northern Mexico than seasonal guerrilla warfare. \\"Contingents of soldaderas were not necessary because at any moment Zapatista soldiers could take refuge in a nearby village.\\" The term soldadera is derived from the Spanish word soldada which denotes a payment made to the person who provided for a soldier's well being.Don M. Coerver, Suzanne B. Pasztor, Robert Buffington, \\"Mexico: an encyclopedia of contemporary culture and history\\", ABC-CLIO, 2004, pg. 472. In fact, most soldaderas \\"who were either blood relations or companions of a soldier usually earned no economic recompense for their work, just like those women who did domestic work in their own home.\\" Soldaderas had been a part of Mexican military long before the Mexican Revolution; however, numbers increased dramatically with the outbreak of the revolution. The revolution saw the emergence of a few female combatants and fewer commanding officers (coronelas). Soldaderas and coronelas are now often lumped together. Soldaderas as camp followers performed vital tasks such as taking care of the male soldiers: cooking, cleaning, setting up camp, cleaning their weapons, and so forth. For soldaderas, the Mexican Revolution was their greatest time in history. Soldaderas came from various social backgrounds, with those \\"to emerge from obscurity belonged to the middle class and played a prominent role in the political movement that led to the revolution.\\"Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, p. 291. Most were likely lower class, rural, mestizo and Native women about whom little is known. Despite the emphasis on female combatants, without the female camp followers, the armies fighting in the Revolution would have been much worse off. When Pancho Villa banned soldaderas from his elite corps of Dorados within his Divisi√≥n del Norte, the incidence of rape increased.Alan Knight, The Mexican Revolution, vol. 2: Counter- revolutionaries and Reconstruction. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, p. 333. They joined the revolution for many different reasons; however, joining was not always voluntary.  Differences between army factions  The Federal Army had large numbers of camp followers, often whole families of the troops. Women were important logistical support to male combatants, since the army did not have an organized way to provision troops. Women sourced food and cooked it for individual soldiers. For the Federal Army, its forced recruitment of soldiers (leva) meant that desertion rates were extremely high, since army service was a form of \\"semi-slavery.\\" By allowing families to remain together, desertion rates were reduced. Much is known about the soldaderas of General Salvador Mercado's army, since he crossed the U.S. border after being beaten by Pancho Villa's army. Some 1,256 women and 554 children were interned in Fort Bliss along with 3,357 army officers and troops.Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, p. 290. When Villa heard of the plight of the destitute Mexican women at Fort Bliss who had appealed to Victoriano Huerta's government, Villa sent them 1,000 pesos in gold.Knight, Mexican Revolution, vol. 2, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, p. 126. In Northern Mexico, the early revolutionary forces (followers of Francisco I. Madero) that helped overthrow Porfirio D√≠az in 1911 lacked camp followers, because there was not much need for them. Revolutionary combatants were mostly cavalry who operated locally rather than far from home as the Federal Army did. Horses were expensive and in short supply, so in general, women remained at home.Katz, Life and Times of Pancho Villa, p. 291. There were some female Maderista combatants, but there are no reports of there being significant numbers of them. In Southern Mexico, the Zapatista army, for the decade of revolutionary struggle, the combatants were usually based in their home villages and largely operated locally, so that camp followers were not necessary. The revolutionary army of the south recruited volunteers from villages, with many campesino villagers remaining non-combatants (pacificos). Sourcing food in the agriculturally rich region of Morelos did not necessitate camp followers, since villages would help out and feed the troops. When the Zapatistas operated farther from home and because the Zapatistas forces lacked camp followers, Zapatistas' rape of village women was a well-known phenomenon. After the overhrow of President Madero in February 1913 by General Victoriano Huerta, northern armies became armies of movement fighting far from home. The Constitutionalist Army divisions now utilized trains rather than cavalry to move men and war materiel, including their horses, as well as soldaderas. The change in technology enabled the movement of combatants, women and children, with horses and male soldiers inside box cars, with women and children on top of them. This created a situation similar to that of the Federal Army, where allowing soldiers to have their wives, sweethearts, and possibly their children with them, soldiers' morale was better and the armies could retain their combatants. In the region where Villa's Divisi√≥n del Norte operated, the railway network was more dense, allowing for greater numbers of women to be part of the enterprise. The women and children utilized all possible space available to them, including on the cow-catchers at the front of locomotives.Knight, Mexican Revolution, vol. 2, p. 143. In the region where Constitutionalist general √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n operated in Sonora, the network was less dense, there was more use of just cavalry, and fewer women and children. When the revolutionary factions split after the ouster of Huerta in 1914 and Obreg√≥n defeated his former comrade-in-arms Villa at the Battle of Celaya, Villa's forces were much reduced and were again on horseback. This smaller, more mobile Villista force no longer included female camp followers and rape increased.Knight, Mexican Revolution, vol. 2, p. 333. A reported Villa atrocity with corrobaration was his killing of a soldadera supporting Villa's former First Chief, Venustiano Carranza, political head of the Constitutionalist faction. In December 1916, a Carrancista woman begged Villa for her husband's life; when informed he was already dead, the new widow called Villa a murderer and worse. Villa shot her dead. Villistas worried that other Carrancista soldaderas would denounce the death when their army returned, they urged Villa to kill the 90 Carrancista soldaderas. Villa's secretary was repelled at the scene slaughter, with the women's bodies piled upon one another, and a two-year old laughing on his mother's body. Elena Poniatowska gives a slightly different account. The story is that there was a shot fired from a group of women, towards Villa. None of the women, whether they actually knew or not, gave up a culprit. Villa then ordered his men to kill every single woman in the group. Everyone, including children, was killed. Villa's troops were then told to loot the bodies for valuables. During their search they found a baby still alive. Villa told them that their orders were to kill absolutely everyone, including the baby. For Villa biographer Friedrich Katz, \\"In moral terms, this execution marked a decisive decline of Villismo and contributed to its popular support in Chihuahua.\\"Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, p. 628. Further Villista atrocities were reported in the Carrancista press.Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, pp. 891-92 The treatment of women varied between different leaders, but in general they were not treated well at all. Even horses were said to be treated better than they were. The horses were valued much more, and so when traveling by train, the horses rode inside train cars while women traveled on the roof. Traveling by train was already risky since revolutionaries was known for blowing up trains and railroads. Being on the roof in plain sight was even more dangerous. There are also stories of women being used as shields to protect Alvaro Obreg√≥n's soldiers.Salas, Soldaderas in the Mexican Military, 47. Life for a soldadera, camp follower or soldier, was extremely hard.Soto, Emergence of the Modern Mexican Woman: Her Participation in Revolution and Struggle for Equality 1910-1940, 44.  Reasons for participating  Revolutionaries and their unarmed Adelitas. Posed undated photo, place unknown = Force = One reason for joining the revolution was through brutal force. Male soldiers often kidnapped women and forced them to join armies.John Reed, Insurgent Mexico(1914). New York: International Publishers 1969, p.108. Other times soldiers would turn up at villages and demand that all the women there join. If the women refused they would be threatened until they gave in or else would be shot and killed. These kidnappings were no secret in Mexico and were frequently reported in the country‚Äôs newspapers. In April 1913, the Mexican Herald newspaper reported that 40 women were captured from the town of Jojutla, by Zapatista armies, as well as all the women from a neighboring town two kilometers away.Salas, Soldaderas in the Mexican Military, 40. Although newspaper reports did alert readers to such issues, literacy rates for women, especially in the countryside, were extremely low, only averaging around 9.5% of the women. This meant that majority of the women would only be able to get information about kidnappings and other dangers by word of mouth. This process would mean that it was probably too late for them to help themselves by the time revolutionary armies appeared in their town. Another form of forcefully making women join the revolution was by a woman‚Äôs husband, with his wanting his wife to take care of him while he was at war. John Reed once asked a soldier why his wife had to also go and fight in Villa‚Äôs army, and he responded by saying, \\"shall I starve then? Who shall make my tortillas but my wife?\\"Fowler-Salamini & Vaughn, Women of the Countryside, 1850-1990, 95. = Protection = Another reason to join the revolution, and probably the most common, was for protection from the men in their family, most often either their husband, father, brother, who had joined one of the revolutionary armies. There was a great need for protection for females as there would be very few males left in their villages, one of the reasons why revolutionary armies had such an easy time going to these villages and forcing the women to join them. It was a very common event for a woman to follow her husband and join whatever force he was fighting for, and she was most likely to be more than willing to do so.Fowler-Salamini & Vaughn, Women of the Countryside, 1850-1990, 95. Especially once the kidnappings began to be more frequent, women who had initially stayed home decided to join the male family members that were fighting. In 1911 in the town of Torreon, a young female named Chico ended up being the last female left in her household because Orozco‚Äôs troops had rampaged the village and killed her mother and sisters. Just like Chico, numerous females joined the forces for the protection of male family members. = Other reasons = Some older women would join the armies as an act of revenge towards Victoriano Huerta's regime. These women would have had husbands, brothers or sons killed by the Federal Army and so with less to live for they would join the fight for the Revolution. Some women supported the ideals for which the armies were fighting, whether the revolutionary or federal armies. More lower class females joined the fight and were fighting on the side of the revolutionary forces. One of the reasons for the Revolution was to have some sort of land reform in Mexico, and since lower-class people‚Äôs lives depended on farming, it made sense to join the side they did.  Roles  = Camp followers = Camp followers had numerous roles to fulfill, all of which related to looking after the male soldiers. Some of the basic roles would be to cook the meals, clean up after meals, clean the weapons and to set up camp for the army. Often, the women would get to the camp site ahead of the men in order to have camp all set up and to begin preparing the food so it was almost ready by the time the men showed up. Foraging, nursing and smuggling were also some of the other tasks they had. Towns that had just previously been fought in were the perfect location for foraging. Once the soldiers had left the women would loot stores for food and search through the dead bodies looking for anything that could be of value or use. Taking care of and nursing the wounded and sick was also another important task women had to fulfill. It was an extremely important role since medical care was not available to most of the soldiers and these women were their only chance of survival if they were wounded. If the army was in an area close enough to a hospital, then the women would also be responsible to get the soldiers that were badly wounded there, pulling them along in ox-carts. Not only did camp followers perform these duties, but also had a much more war-like task. They would have to smuggle hundreds and hundreds of rounds of ammunition to the fighting forces, especially from the United States into Mexico. They would hide the ammunition under their skirts and breasts and were given this duty because they were perceived as harmless women and therefore hardly ever caught. =Defense of symbols of the revolution= Mar√≠a Arias Bernal defended Madero's tomb during Victoriano Huerta's counter-revolution After the forced resignation and murder of Francisco I. Madero during the counter-revolutionary coup of February 1913, Madero's grave in Mexico City was subject to vandalism by adherents of the new regime. Mar√≠a Arias Bernal defended it against all odds, and was given public recognition for her bravery by Constitutionalist Army General √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. = Medical support = Elena Arizmendi Mejia and volunteers of the Neutral White Cross, 1911 An important role that women played during the Mexican Revolution's violence was as nurses. Most were likely anonymous, and nursed without being part of a formal organization or equipment. However, a significant figure was Elena Arizmendi Mejia, who created the Neutral White Cross when the Red Cross refused to treat revolutionary soldiers. Arizmendi was from an elite family and knew Francisco Madero before he was president. The Neutral White Cross leadership attempted to oust her from leadership when she was photographed in the pose of a soldadera or coronela, with crossed bandoliers, supposedly as a joke for her paramour, Jos√© Vasconcelos, later to become Minister of Public Education in the Obreg√≥n government.John Mraz, Photographing the Mexican Revolution, Austin: University of Texas Press 2012, p. 68. = Female combatants = A number of women served as combatants, but how many is not known. Some women became combatants by first joining the army passing as male, speaking in deep voices, wearing men‚Äôs clothing, and wrapping their breasts tightly to hide them. The most obvious role they had as combatants was to fight against opponents in battles. For those that were known to be female and not in disguise, some served spies against on enemy armies, dressing as women and joining the camp followers of an enemy army in order gain inside information. They would also be given important information that they would have to relay between generals of the same army. Some would say they were given this task because they were trusted, but more likely the reason would be because males still did not see these women as equals and being messengers seemed like a more feminine role of a soldier.  Notable individuals  = Petra / Pedro Herrera = One of the most famous female combatants was Petra Herrera.Cano, \\"Soldaderas and Coronelas, p. 1359. At the beginning she dressed as a man and took the given name of Pedro, joining the ranks of Villa‚Äôs army. She kept her identity a secret until she had been acknowledged as a great soldier. Once she established her reputation, \\"she let her hair grow, plaiting it into braids, and resuming her female identity.Cano, \\"Soldaderas and Coronelas, p. 1359 According to one of Villa‚Äôs troops, Herrera was the person who should have been credited for the siege of the town of Torre√≥n. However, Villa was not willing to have a female take credit as an important role in a battle and therefore she was never given what she deserved. As a result of her lack of acknowledgment, she left Villa‚Äôs troops and formed her own troop of all female soldiers. She became an ally of Carranza and his army and became a legend for all females around the country.Salas, Soldaderas in the Mexican Military, 48. = Mar√≠a Quinteras de Meras = Mar√≠a Quinteras de Meras was one of the most remarkable female combatants of the time. She joined Pancho Villa's army in 1910. Having fought in ten battles from 1910 to 1913,Cano, \\"Soldaderas and Coronelas\\", p. 1359 she had risen to the rank of colonel\\"The Mexican Revolution and the United States in the Collections of the Library of Congress. Individual Women During the Revolution\\" and was a well decorated soldier. She was so respected as a soldier, despite Villa's dislike of soldaderas, that her husband, who served in the same army, was actually lower in rank than herself. Respect was enough for Mar√≠a Quinteras de Meras; she did not allow Villa to pay her for fighting in his army. She gained this respect because she was an extremely gifted soldier. She was known to fight just as well as any male soldier and was even thought to have supernatural powers. = Angela / √Ångel Jim√©nez = Angela Jim√©nez insisted on being known as √Ångel Jim√©nez (the male version of the name). From Oaxaca, she became \\"an explosives expert and known for her courage in battle. According to one scholar, she \\"refused sexual or sentimental links with the opposite sex, pledging to her comrades that she would shoot anyone who tried to seduce her.\\" She originally joined the revolutionary forces, joining her father in fighting the federal army because there had been a raid on her village by federal troops. A federal officer was unsuccessful though and her sister managed to kill him but then right after she took her own life. Jim√©nez then decided to join her father fighting against the Federal Army and disguised herself as a male. She fought for multiple rebel groups but ended up fighting with Carranza and then revealed her true identity. Even known as a woman she rose to the position of lieutenant and earned the respect from the rest of the troops. She continued fighting against the Federal Army for years under her true identity as a female, and was a true believer that having a revolution would be the start of having justice.Fowler-Salamini & Vaughn, Women of the Countryside, 1850-1990, 98. Amelio Robles Avila, coronela in the Revolutionary Army of the South =Amelio Robles √Åvila= Amelio Robles √Åvila, \\"El g√ºero\\", was a distinguished soldier in the Revolutionary Army of the South. Robles had learned to ride horses and shoot from an early age, and after the revolution started, Robles dressed as a man and ultimately became a colonel in the Legionary Cavalry. From 1913 to 1918, Robles fought as \\"el coronel Robles\\" with the Zapatistas. Following the military phase of the Revolution, Robles supported revolutionary general √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, president of Mexico 1920-1924, as well as during the 1924 rebellion of Adolfo de la Huerta. Robles lived as a man for the remainder of his long life, which was marked towards the end by various decorations acknowledging his distinguished military service: decoration as a veteran (veterano) of the Mexican Revolution and the Legion of Honor of the Mexican Army, and in the 1970s, the award of M√©rito revolucionario. Robles died December 9, 1984, aged 95. Foreign observers In November 1911, a Swedish mercenary, Ivar Thord-Gray, who was part of Villa's forces observed preparations for battle. \\"The women camp followers had orders to remain behind, but hundreds of them hanging onto the stirrups followed their men on the road for awhile. Some other women carrying carbines, bandoleers [sic] and who were mounted, managed to slip into the ranks and came with us. These took their places in the firing lines and withstood hardship and machine gun fire as well as the men. They were a brave worthy lot. It was a richly picturesque sight, but the complete silence, the stoic yet anxious faces of the women was depressing, as it gave the impression that all were going to a tremendous funeral, or their doom.\\"Ivar Thord-Gray [Ivar Thord Hallstr√∂m], Gringo Rebel: Mexico, 1913-1914. Coral Gables FL: University of Miami Press 1960, p. 36-37, quoted in Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, p. 226. A U.S. secret agent, Edwin Emerson, gave reports on Villa's army, with an observation on the women. \\"The conduct of the women who came along on the railway trains and many of whom accompanied their men into the firing line around Torre√≥n was also notably heroic.\\"quoted in Katz, The Life and Times of Pancho Villa, p. 304. Leftist journalist John Reed, a leftist Harvard graduate, is the most well-known foreign observer reporting on soldaderas. His reports from his four months with Pancho Villa's army in 1913 during the struggle against Huerta were published as individual newspaper articles and then collected as Insurgent Mexico in 1914. In one report, he recorded the reaction of one Villa's soldier to the kidnapping of his soldadera wife by Pascual Orozco's colorados. \\"They took my woman who is mine, and my commission and all my papers, and all my money. But I am wretched with grief when I think of my silver spurs inlaid with gold, which I bought only last year in Mapimi!\\" In another report, Reed recorded that women who were already soldaderas and whose man had fallen in battle often took up with another soldier. He devotes a chapter in Insurgent Mexico to a woman he calls \\"Elizabetta,\\" whose man was killed and a captain of Villa's forces had claimed her as his. Reed says that the soldier \\"found her wandering aimlessly in the hacienda [after a battle], apparently out of her mind; and that, needing a woman, he had ordered her to follow him, which she did, unquestioningly, after the custom of her sex and country.\\"Reed, Insurgent Mexico, p. 111. Photographing soldaderas Illustration of soldaderas with rifles in an undated photo, no location. The development of photography allowed for a greater range of social types recorded for history. A number were photographed in formal poses. One woman was photographed by the H. J. Guti√©rrez agency, identified on the photo along with the photographic company's name as Herlinda Perry in Ciudad Ju√°rez in May 1911. She is shown holding a .30-30 carbine while seated on a low fence dressed in a skirt and blouse, with crossed bandoliers and two cartridge belts around her waist. So far, nothing further is known about her.Mraz, Photographing the Mexican Revolution, p. 68-69, photo 4-15. Another posed photo of Maderista soldaderas shown with bandoliers and rifles, with one Herlinda Gonz√°lez in it. The women are well turned out in dresses. Two men flank the line of soldaderas, and two children also with bandoliers and rifles kneel in front of the group.Mraz, Photographing the Mexican Revolution, p. 70, photo 4-16. The founder of the Neutral White Cross, Elena Arizmendi Mejia was photographed as a soldadera, supposedly as a joke. She was already a prominent woman taking an active role in the revolution. The photo of her as a soldadera was published in the newspapers, and her antagonists attempted to use to say she was violating the neutrality of the medical organization.Mraz, Photographing the Mexican Revolution, p. 70. However, Jos√© Guadalupe Posada made a lithograph from the photo and published it as the cover for corridos about the revolution, titling the image \\"La Maderista.\\"Gabriela Cano, Se llamaba Elena Arizmendi, Mexico City: Tusquets 2010, p. 131.  Corridos  Corridos are ballads or folk songs that came around during the Mexican Revolution and started to gain popularity after the revolution. Most of these corridos were about soldaderas and originally were battle hymns, but now have been ways for soldaderas to gain some fame and be documented in history. However, in most corridos, an aspect of love was part of the story line and in current day they became extremely romanticized.Fowler-Salamini & Vaughn, Women of the Countryside, 1850-1990, 102. = La Adelita = The most famous corrido is called \\"La Adelita\\", and was based on a woman who was a soldadera for Madero‚Äôs troops.Soto, Emergence of the Modern Mexican Woman: Her Participation in Revolution and Struggle for Equality 1910-1940, 44. This corrido and the image of this woman became the symbol of the revolution and Adelita‚Äôs name has become synonymous with soldaderas. No one truly knows if the corrido based on this woman was a female soldier or a camp follower, or even perhaps that she was just a representation of a mix of different females that were a part of the revolution. Whatever the truth though, in Mexico and the U.S. today, Adelita has become an inspiration and a symbol for any woman who fights for her rights. If you google \\"La Adelita Del Rio Texas\\" you will find that there is a grave in the San Felipe Cemetery with a headstone placed by the Mexican Consulate. It is claimed by the local newspaper and other sources to be the resting place of the woman who inspired the corrido (ballad). Many of the traditional corrido's praise her femininity, loyalty, and beauty instead of her valor and courage in battle.  La Valentina  A lesser known corrido called \\"La Valentina\\" and was based on a female soldier named Valentina Ramirez that predates the Mexican revolution. Like La Adelita, La Valentina corrido became famous and prominent due to her femininity and not her valor in battle.  Modern-day portrayals  La Soldadera mural from Chicano Park in Barrio Logan, San Diego, California Popular culture has changed the image of soldaderas throughout history, however, it has not been a static definition and has made the image ever- changing. Mass media in Mexico turned the female soldiers into heroines that sacrificed their lives for the revolution, and turned camp followers into nothing more than just prostitutes. As a result, it made the idea of a female soldier synonymous with a soldadera and the idea of a camp follower was unimportant and therefore forgotten. However, with more recent popular culture, even the image of female soldiers has become sexualized. Images of female soldiers have become consumerist products portrayed as sexy females rather than portraying them as the revolutionary soldiers that they were.Arrizon, \\"\\"Soldaderas\\" and the Staging of the Mexican Revolution\\", 108. The modern day images of soldaderas do not maintain the positive, worthy aspects of the real-life soldaderas from history. However, images of soldaderas in popular culture are not always extremely sexualized. Adelita, now synonymous with a soldadera, has also become a part of children‚Äôs popular culture. Tomie dePaola wrote a children‚Äôs novel called Adelita, a Mexican Cinderella Story. The plot follows similarly to the original Cinderella story, but changes details so that the story fits into Mexican culture and norms. Adelita is the name of Cinderella and she has to have the courage to fight against the evil step mother and step sisters, and has to fight for the man that she falls in love with. This may not portray soldaderas as fighting for rights, but she is fighting for something and not just a sexy pin-up style girl. A believable soldadera and a female soldier were portrayed by Jenny Gago as the good-natured prostitute La Garduna in Old Gringo (1989) and Marie Gomez as the tough and passionate Lieut. Chiquita in The Professionals (1966). Soldaderas have also regained some of their respect through the arts. The Ballet Folkl√≥rico de M√©xico did a U.S. tour in 2010 celebrating Mexico's history. When it came time to celebrate the Mexican Revolution, the ballet celebrated it only through the female soldiers. As well, the image of soldaderas has also reverted to a symbol of fighting for women's rights for some adults. Especially for Mexican women and Americans in the United States that come from a Mexican heritage, the idea of a soldadera has gone back to the original meaning of the word and denotes a female soldier. For them, a soldadera holds a spirit of revolutionArrizon, \\"\\"Soldaderas\\" and the Staging of the Mexican Revolution\\", 109. and has become a sort of role model for self- empowerment, especially for Mexican ancestry females in the United States as they are not just fighting as part of the minority of women, but also as part of the chicano minority. The fighting soldadera was adopted by the chicano movement, the mindset of soldaderas being violent hot blooded revolutionaries or poor, pregnant camp followers persisted when depicting the soldadera. The Chicana feminist movement took the iconography of the soldaderas and made it their own. The brown berrets, a chicana female activism group calls them their inspiration. As well the Chicano movement latched onto them as well, but while women praised their valor, and courage in battle men praised their loyalty to their husbands, and nation further illustrating the machismo culture and the ideological split among the sexes.

Shortly thereafter, deployed to the Pacific Theater. From December 1942 until cessation of hostilities in late 1945, the Group participated in numerous operations in the Solomon and Philippine Islands supporting the Army, Navy and Marine Corps as well as Philippine guerrilla forces. MAG 12 was brought to the Philippines by the request of Admiral \\"Bull\\" Halsey when he said, > I had had under my command in the South Pacific a Marine Air Group which had > proved its versatility in everything from fighting to blasting enemy > vessels. I knew that the group was now under MacArthur's command, and I > knew, too, without understanding why, that when Kenney was not keeping it > idle, he was assigning it to missions far below its capacity. Kinkaid's > complaint of insufficient air cover prompted me to take a step which was > more than a liberty; to a man of meaner spirit than MacArthur's it would > have seemed an impertinence. I called these Marines to his attention. He > ordered them forward, and within 24 hours of their arrival, they had > justified my recommendation. For such service, the Group earned the Army Distinguished Unit Award and the Navy Unit Citation. =Korean War= On 20 April 1952, MAG-12 made its home at K-6 Air Base, Pyongtaek.Ballenger (2000), p.x.

Through the end of the Korean War, the group participated successfully in numerous operations and accumulated over 80,000 effective combat sorties against enemy troops, installations, vehicles and countless other vital targets. A second Navy Unit citation was awarded for its Korean War service. =Post Korea and Vietnam War= During 1956, after nearly 6 years in Korea, MAG-12 was withdrawn to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, and remained there conducting close air support for Fleet Marine Forces in the Western Pacific until 1965. In May 1965, MAG-12 deployed to Chu Lai, Vietnam, to support Marine infantry and other allied forces in their engagements against the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army units. The Group participated in many large operations, including the recapture of Hue City and the relief of besieged units at Khe Sanh. Two more Navy Unit Citations were received as a result of the Group's contribution to the Vietnam War effort. After almost 5 years of combat, MAG-12 was withdrawn from the Republic of Vietnam in February 1970, and reestablished at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. MAG-12's stay in Japan, though, was short. In May 1972, MAG-12 again deployed to Vietnam and conducted combat operations from Bien Hoa Air Base until finally withdrawing from the war on 29 January 1973 where they were the last American combat aviation unit still in country.Mersky (1983), p.283. MAG-12 then returned to MCAS Iwakuni, where it remains today. =Post Vietnam= From this base, MAG-12 has conducted numerous operations throughout the WESTPAC area and participated in hundreds of joint service training exercises, continually honing its combat skills.

On the name, Spears said: \\"As I get older, the names go with my age.\\" \\"It's more demanding, it's more sensual, it's black, it's about being in control. That's cool and inspirational ... girls need that.\\" =Curious Heart= The packaging of Curious Heart is a unique twist on the original Curious. The bottle has the same multi-faceted glass silhouette, but is designed in a shade of pale pink. Along the rim are alternating fleur de lis and heart symbols, and embossed on the pale pink bottle is an image that resembles a tattoo: a heart with sprawling wings. The magenta atomizer remains in keeping with the bottle's timeless Hollywood look. The fragrance smells similar to the original; its notes are pear, lotus flower, magnolia, vanilla, morning tuberose, flowers, jasmine, musk, sandalwood. This is a Collector's Edition bottle which is limited throughout the United States and is mostly available through Elizabeth Arden's official website.

They lived in continence as they affirmed Abel did. They were required to be married but were forbidden to consummate the marriage. Each couple was required to adopt two children, a boy and a girl. When their adoptive parents died, these adoptees would then form a couple and adopt further two children. Because no children of Abel are mentioned in Scripture, the Abelians assumed that he had none. This view was influenced by Jewish, and Manichean-inspired Gnostic perspectives on Abel that recognized that, while he was married, he remained a virgin. The only record of the sect is in Augustine of Hippo's De Haereticis ch. 87,Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1957; p. 4 where he writes that the name of the sect is probably of Punic origin. According to Augustine, the sect became extinct in 428 when its last members converted to Catholicism.

Since 1 April 2008 he has been played by James Forde. Liam was absent from the show for a large part of 2012 along with the rest of his family. On 27 April 2015, it was announced that Forde had decided to leave the role and departed on screen on 17 August 2015. Storylines involving Liam include his struggles at school after being diagnosed with dyslexia, his brief association with a gang and his relationship with Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene). Storylines The son of Ricky (Sid Owen) and Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer), Liam is born prematurely on Christmas Day 1998, in The Queen Victoria public house. In September 1999, Liam's parents separate and Bianca takes him to Manchester. Despite returning to Walford briefly in April 2000 to visit his father, Liam rarely sees Ricky. In May 2002, Ricky visits him with his fianc√©e Cassie to discuss custody of Liam. After a series of events, Bianca gives Liam to Ricky. Shortly afterwards, Ricky and Liam return to Walford but leave in 2004. Off-screen, Liam is returned to Bianca in 2006, following Ricky's engagement to Melinda (Siobhan Hayes), who did not want children. Liam returns to Walford with his mother and siblings, Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith), Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs) and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), in April 2008 after they are evicted by their landlord. He and his siblings spend a week in care due to the police finding them homeless and Bianca assaulting a police officer, Liam settles back in Walford, living with Bianca, Ricky and his great-grandmother Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement). Later that year, Liam begins skipping school, feigning illness and it is subsequently revealed that he is dyslexic, explaining his inferior grades and repeated absences. Ricky takes an active role in Liam's schooling, helping to improve his grades. With secondary school approaching, Liam is denied a place at Walford High and is offered a place at King Edward V, which Bianca and Ricky think is too far away. Their appeal is unsuccessful so Bianca decides to homeschool Liam instead. However, when Bianca and her mother Carol (Lindsey Coulson) argue, Liam says he will go to King Edward V and will work hard. However, before he starts there, he worries that none of his old friends will be there and sneaks out to the park, where Carol's date Lewis Daley (Deka Walmsley) gives him encouragement and tells him that life is never easy. At Liam's uncle Billie Jackson's (Devon Anderson) birthday party, Liam sees Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) drunkenly kiss Ricky. The morning after, Liam, Tiffany and Morgan are told Billie is unwell, but Liam correctly guesses that he has died. Later, he is angry at Kim and sends her away when she brings food to the house. He then talks to Ricky, and Bianca overhears him saying Kim kissed Ricky. When Morgan accidentally squirts tomato ketchup over Billie's hoody, Liam tries to wash off the stain but is caught by Carol; who slaps him on his face, causing his forehead to bleed. Although they make amends, Bianca discovers the cut, which causes an argument. Carol then bans the family from attending Billie's funeral. Carol embarks on an affair with a friend of Billie's, Connor Stanley (Arinze Kene), but Connor continues to see Whitney. Tiffany sees this and tells Liam, who encourages her to keep quiet as he worries it will split up the family. Liam eventually tells Ricky but Bianca has already found out and beaten Connor, leaving him unconscious. Liam is upset when Bianca gives herself in to the police. He is then suspended from school for hitting another boy. Bianca is subsequently sent to prison, and Ricky later leaves for a six-month job in Dubai. Liam makes friends with Eddie Moon (David Essex), who Carol is interested in romantically. However, when Eddie allows Liam to skip school for three days so Eddie can teach him about antiques, Carol tells Eddie to stay away from her and Liam. Liam continues to be friends with Eddie and is looking after his stock when Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) takes him away and burns the stock. Eddie gives Liam a job after he moves his antiques business to Walford, and Lola confesses to Liam that she started the fire. Liam is happy when Carol and Eddie begin a relationship, but is saddened when they break up and Eddie leaves Walford. When Lola, Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) and Liam's cousin Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) want to steal alcohol from a party at Kim Fox's (Tameka Empson) bed and breakfast, they get Liam to dress up in a Halloween costume to do it for them. He steals a bowl of punch, which they drink in the local launderette. Kim later finds them and takes the punch back. Lola pays Liam to take a bag from Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) but is caught, forcing him to reveal that Lola told him to take the bag. In December 2011, the family begin to have financial difficulties, and Liam becomes hostile towards Ricky, blaming him for their situation. After the local bed and breakfast burns down, Liam is paid by his uncle Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) to enter the building and find scrap metal. Liam is upset by the death of Pat and the departure of his father, Ricky. Although Bianca and Ricky tell Liam it is only temporary, Liam knows it is permanent. Liam then gets a part-time job cleaning to help out the family with money. Bianca is later caught stealing money and returns to prison, but this time located in Suffolk. Liam then moves to Suffolk with the rest of his family to be near his mother, but returns to Walford with his family in November 2012. After the death of Derek on Christmas 2012, Liam finds the smuggled goods Derek has been hiding in the Jackson garage he tells Bianca who calls the police but when Bianca opens the garage to show the police the smuggled goods, everything is gone. It is revealed that Liam has done a deal with Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) to sell them. Liam starts truanting from school and is brought home to Bianca by the police. Bianca is warned that if he continues, she could receive a fine or go back to prison. Liam promises to go to school the next day but does not, and tells Bianca she thinks he is a loser and knows nothing about him. Liam becomes involved in a gang, who mug Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). The gang leader, Kane (Harry Rafferty) gives Liam Tamwar's money belt, which Bianca finds. She suspects he has joined the gang, and confronts them at an estate, where she tells Liam to come home, but he stays with them. The next morning, Liam returns home and refuses to go to school, so Bianca locks him in his room to stop him seeing the gang, and also slaps him. Liam manipulates Whitney into letting him out, and he runs away. He returns to the gang, who initiate him into the gang by making him shoplift alcohol, smash a car window and mug his colleague Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). Shirley realises it is Liam and sends him away with ¬£10. The gang then throw Liam a party, but the police arrive and arrest the gang over Tamwar's mugging. Liam refuses to talk to the police and is released on bail without charge. Liam wants to talk to Kane, and when he finds the gang, they blame him for their arrests, and one of the gang members, Little Chris (Rizwan Shebani) stabs Liam on Kane's orders. Bianca sees this and Liam is rushed to hospital, where the police offer him help but only if he tells them the truth. Bianca leaves the decision to Liam. He eventually tells them the truth but this only makes the situation worse when the entire gang including Little Chris are bailed without charge once again as they deny any involvement in Liam's stabbing. Fearing the gang may harm his family, Liam arranges to live with his father Ricky but later changes his mind. Liam receives death threats from Kane, which leads to a final confrontation after which Kane is arrested again and Liam goes to stay with Ricky. Liam then returns for the court case, but does not need to give evidence because Little Chris changes his plea to guilty. Liam settles into living in Walford again and soon develops a crush on Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene). Liam is shocked when Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) accuses him of having had underage sex with Cindy and threatens to report him to police, forcing Cindy to confess that she made it up to impress TJ Spraggan (George Sargeant). A drunk Cindy later kisses Liam and he loses his virginity to her. Ian discovers that Cindy is pregnant but Liam denies responsibility and is furious when TJ reveals himself to be the father. Liam discovers that Carol has breast cancer and supports her through her treatment. Bianca decides to move the family to Milton Keynes following Carol's recovery but a reluctant Liam is eventually allowed to stay in Walford. Cindy kisses Liam after she tells him that she is struggling to be a mother to Beth. Liam stops the kiss, knowing that Cindy is upset. Liam develops a sexual relationship with Cindy. Liam supports Cindy through her parental struggles, but Beth is eventually handed over to TJ. Ian throws Cindy out, so Liam hides her in his room, which Carol eventually discovers. Cindy tells Liam that Bobby killed Lucy and Liam threatens to tell the police, but Ian gives Liam and Cindy a ticket to leave for good. Carol finds out about this and Liam demands ¬£100,000 for him and Cindy to leave Walford to live with Ricky in Germany or he tells Carol and the police that Bobby killed Lucy. However, Ricky informs Liam he cannot take any money, but he relents when Jane promises him recurring payments. He and Cindy then leave Walford together after saying goodbye to their families. Creation and development Liam is a character that was born in the serial; the first son of Bianca (Patsy Palmer) and Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) who was conceived following the forced abortion of their first daughter in 1997 after she was diagnosed with spina bifida. Bianca's pregnancy with Liam was used by the programme makers to spread a public message in 1998; the scriptwriters included scenes of a practitioner advising Bianca to take folic acid, which protects against spina bifida. The Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (ASBAH) issued a public plea to EastEnders, urging them to allow Bianca's second baby to be born with spina bifida, in order to show parents that having a baby with spina bifida is \\"not the end of the world\\". This did not occur, however, and Bianca was shown to give birth to a premature but healthy baby Liam in an episode that aired on Christmas Day 1998. Related to the Branning and the Beale family through his mother and the Butcher family through his father, Liam and his sister Tiffany have more relatives than any other character to have appeared in the show. After three separate stints in EastEnders played by different child/baby actors - most substantially from 2002‚Äì2004, when Liam returned to Albert Square as part of his father Ricky's introduction - Liam returned in a more prominent role in 2008, played by James Forde. His return was confirmed on 29 October 2007 following the announcement that Patsy Palmer and Sid owen were reprising their roles as Bianca and Ricky; he reappeared on-screen in April 2008. Upon his return, it was said that Liam had \\"taken to being the man of the house\\", and was described as \\"not very academic, but [...] always willing to try new things ‚Äì a trait which sees him quite often in trouble. His laddish demeanour, however, is softened by the affection he is not afraid to show his mum.\\" As part of the reintroduction of Bianca, four children, including Liam, were scripted into the character's narrative, including Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), the sixteen-year-old daughter of Bianca's deceased partner; Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith), Bianca's five-year-old daughter; and Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs), Bianca's two-year-old son, \\"the most [spoilt] out of all of the kids\\". To promote the family's introduction, the BBC began airing trailers across the BBC network in March 2008. One trailer saw Bianca singing The Jackson 5 hit \\"I Want You Back\\" and performing a dance routine along with her four children. The promo uses the tag line \\"Introducing The Jackson 5\\". Within three days of being posted on the video sharing website YouTube, the promo had been viewed 52,000 times. =Gang Involvement= In January 2008, it was reported that Liam would be involved in a gang storyline, starting in March. Digital Spy said Liam \\"[goes] off the rails when he gets involved with a gang in an upcoming storyline.\\" They said the storyline would run \\"for a while\\", and Forde had tweeted about being \\"very busy\\" at work with \\"great stuff coming up\\". It emerged that EastEnders producers had worked with charity Comic Relief to \\"highlight the growing problem of teen involvement in gangs.\\" The plot was called \\"hard-hitting\\", and it was reported that Bianca would try to get Liam to choose between the gang and his family, though his choice remained to be seen. EastEnders undertook research into why teenagers become involved in gangs and the effects the it can have. Executive Producer Lorraine Newman said of the storyline, \\"We are delighted to be working with Comic Relief once again. This subject matter is something which is touching the lives of so many young people in London and other cities around the UK. We have taken the opportunity to see the impact from a mother's perspective, and Patsy Palmer gives a powerful performance of a mother doing all she can to protect her son. The telling of this story has also given us the chance to explore the reasons behind the attraction of gangs for teenagers.\\" Judith McNeill, Grants Director for Comic Relief, added: \\"Comic Relief is really excited to be working with EastEnders again to highlight an important issue supported by Red Nose Day. [...] This year's storyline should play an [...] important role in promoting greater understanding of why young people are vulnerable to becoming involved in gangs.\\" The storyline included a six-minute episode broadcast during Red Nose Day on 15 March 2008. =Departure= On 27 April 2015, it was announced that Forde would be written out but exact details of his exit were being kept under wraps. James Forde tweeted; \\"Absolutely honoured to have a world with some of the people I have worked with. It's amazing and the future is exciting.\\" The character made his final appearance on 17 August 2015. Reception Kate White of Inside Soap praised Forde's acting during Liam's gang involvement storyline, but admitted she could not see the appeal of gangs: \\"The Bianca and Liam story was brilliantly acted - but we really couldn't see what the great appeal of gang life was supposed to have been. It seemed to be all dingy bedsits and general skulking about.\\" See also *List of soap opera recasts References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Child characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 1998 Category:Fictional gang members Category:Fictional characters with dyslexia Category:Male characters in television Category:Beale family (EastEnders) Category:Teenage characters in television ","title":"Liam Butcher"},{"id":"3618829","text":"Freddie Falcon before a game in 2012 Frederick \\"Freddie\\" Falcon is the official mascot of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.

It is part of the City of Lake Macquarie local government area. The village is the oldest continuous settlement in the City of Lake Macquarie. The Aboriginal people in this area, the Awabakal were the first people of this land. A surf club is sited overlooking the beach that is quite popular for recreation. Mining The settlement was first made after land was purchased on 1 April 1865. The town of Cowper was created, to serve as a base for coal mining by the New Wallsend Company in 1873 with the first shipment on 17 December of that year. The name Catherine Hill was adopted to commemorate the schooner Catherine Hill that had run aground in 1867.Jack Kenneth Loney Wrecks on the New South Wales Coast 1992 0646110810 p.49 \\"The schooner Catherine Hill, laden with 30,000 feet of pine and cedar, went ashore on June 21st between Bird Island Point and Lake Macquarie after battling a severe gale. The crew of four reached safety after she ran on to a sandy beach\\" Later, the Wallarah Coal Company mined and shipped coal from the area including its nearby Crangan Bay mine. This was taken over by the Coal and Allied Group. A railway originally was used to transport the coal to the wharf;Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, February 1973, pp25-44 later, trucks and automated loading belt systems were used. Rutile was mined from the beach sands during the 1960s. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 162 people in Catherine Hill Bay. 89.3% of people were born in Australia and 93.5% of people spoke only English at home. Development Proposals for rezoning and redevelopment of the area for housing were opposed by LMCC and residents as the land was zoned for conservation. Environmentalists contended that the heathlands around the village contained a large variety of wildflowers, some dwarfed into unusual forms from the exposed coastal conditions. On 1 September 2009, a court ruled the development agreement illegal. However, a new Housing Development of 550 houses was approved by the State Government in 2010.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 17, 1994. In the episode, Ned Flanders invites Homer to a football game and the two become good friends. However, Ned soon grows weary of Homer's overbearing friendship and stupid antics, and begins to hate him. The episode was written by David Richardson and directed by Wesley Archer. It was the last episode to be pitched by writer Conan O'Brien before he left The Simpsons. The episode features cultural references to films such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Deadly Tower, and The Ten Commandments, and songs such as \\"Two Tickets to Paradise\\", \\"Macho Man\\", and \\"Helter Skelter\\". Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 10.9, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot Homer unsuccessfully tries to win tickets for a football game on a radio contest. Ned wins the tickets and invites Homer as his guest. Although he dislikes Ned, Homer accepts because he desperately wants to attend the game. Ned pays for all of the food and persuades the winning quarterback to give the game ball to Homer. Overwhelmed by Ned's generosity, Homer becomes friends with Ned and his family. Homer begins acting overly grateful and annoys Ned and his family to no end by interrupting their family time together. The Flanders family and the Simpson family go on a camping trip together but do not get along. When the Simpsons start a food fight, Ned tells his wife that he has grown to hate Homer. Upon returning home, Homer remains oblivious to Ned's animosity. He arrives at the Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but Ned and his family get in their car and race off without him. Pulled over by Chief Wiggum for speeding, Ned takes a sobriety test as disapproving townspeople watch. At church, when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer, Homer inhales very loudly through his nose, causing Ned to yell at him. This alarms the worshippers, who become even more upset with Ned. But Homer sticks up for Ned and convinces them to give him another chance. The next week, everything returns to normal as Homer is once again annoyed by Ned. The episode ends with the Simpsons spending the night in Homer's great Uncle Boris' haunted house, which he recently inherited. After turning out the lights, they see something that causes them to scream in terror. Production \\"Homer Loves Flanders\\" was the last episode to be pitched by Conan O'Brien before he left the show.\\"Homer Loves Flanders\\" was the last episode to be pitched by Conan O'Brien before he left The Simpsons. David Richardson was assigned to write it, and Wesley Archer to direct it. Richardson wrote the episode at a Motel 6 in Hemet, California while he was dating an actress who was shooting a film there. In this season, the staff wanted to take a deeper look at the relationships of the characters. One of the things they wanted to explore in particular was what Homer and Flanders have in common and how they could turn into friends. Former show runner David Mirkin enjoyed making Homer and Flanders get along because they do not normally act that way. The episode begins with the Simpson family watching a news broadcast in which the news anchor Kent Brockman calls the United States Army a \\"kill-bot factory\\". Mirkin said this was a joke the staff \\"particularly loved to do\\" because it pointed out how negative and mean- spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly \\"always trying to scare everybody\\" by creating panic and depression. In one scene in the episode, Marge begins hallucinating after drinking from Springfield's water supply, which has been spiked with LSD by Springfield's rival town, Shelbyville. The Fox network's censors wanted the scene to be cut from the episode because they did not like the idea of Marge \\"getting high\\" on LSD. Mirkin defended the scene, and argued Marge was not \\"doing it on purpose\\", so the censors ultimately allowed the scene to remain in the episode. The censors also hated Ned's response to his wife telling him to drive his car faster (\\"I can't! It's a Geo!\\") fearing they could lose the car company's sponsorship, but Mirkin kept the line in. In another scene, Homer becomes frustrated at God for not getting the tickets to the game, so yells at a waffle stuck to the ceiling that he believes is God. Marge points out that it is just a waffle that Bart threw up there. This scene, inspired by some melted caramel stuck to the ceiling of the Simpsons writers' room, is one of Mirkin's and Richardson's \\"all time favorite\\" jokes. Cultural references A reference is made in the episode to Edward G. Robinson's character Dathan from the 1956 film The Ten Commandments. When Homer hears the 1978 song \\"Two Tickets to Paradise\\" by Eddie Money on the radio, he sings along and plays air guitar. As Homer is eating nachos at the football game, he makes up a song called \\"Nacho Man\\", a reference to Village People's 1978 song \\"Macho Man\\". Homer's \\"Rappin' Ronnie Reagan\\" cassette is a reference to the 1984 Broadway show and novelty music video Rap Master Ronnie and Ronald Reagan. When Flanders is mistakenly arrested for taking drugs, Chief Wiggum asks him \\"Where's your Messiah now?\\", a line commonly mistakenly believed to be spoken by Edward G. Robinson's character Dathan in the 1956 film The Ten Commandments but in fact originates from Billy Crystal's stand-up impersonation of Robinson. Ned's dream involves him shooting at people inside the university clock tower based on the 1975 film The Deadly Tower, itself based on Charles Whitman's 1966 killing spree. The scene where Homer chases Flanders's car is a parallel of the sequence in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, in which Robert Patrick's character T-1000 chases the heroes in the police car after escaping from the hospital. Homer morphing through the Flanders hedge also parodies how the T-1000's shape shifting abilities were shown in the film. It has since become a popular internet meme. When Rod and Todd are watching television in the Flanders's living room, a picture of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper can be seen behind them. The homeless shelter that Homer and Flanders visit is called Helter Shelter, a reference to the 1968 song \\"Helter Skelter\\" by The Beatles.. Helter Shelter would later go on to be used as title of an episode in the shows fourteenth season. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Homer Loves Flanders\\" finished 43rd in the ratings for the week of March 14‚Äì20, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 10.9. The episode was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called the episode his eighth favorite of the show. He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode, as well as Lisa's self-referential quote about how, \\"by next week, we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure.\\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode had \\"some great existential musings\\" from Lisa. They added that it also \\"contains some nice moments highlighting the differences between the Simpsons and the Flanders.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: \\"I always remembered [\\"Homer Loves Flanders\\"] to be a great episode ‚Äì and I recalled correctly. Sure, the show goes with a less than creative presence; it‚Äôs an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways. However, the development of the theme is terrific, as we learn the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson.\\" DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B‚àí grade, claiming the \\"rather large dose of sentimentality\\" and \\"fewer moments of absurdity\\" in the episode gave it \\"the feeling that it belongs in one of the series' earlier seasons\\". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme.

Its title means \\"wherever\\" in the Romani language, and the show is an \\"acrobatic tribute to the nomadic soul\\". The show begins with the Greek myth of Icarus, picking up where the myth leaves off, reimagining the story of what happened to Icarus after he flew too close to the sun and fell from the sky. In Varekai, rather than drowning in the sea below him, Icarus lands in a lush forest full of exotic creatures. Set and technical information The set, created by St√©phane Roy, includes four major components: the forest, stage, catwalk, and lookout. The forest consists of 330 \\"trees\\", of which around 20 are climbable. The trees range from to in height. The stage is in diameter and has five trap doors, two turntables, and one elevating platform. The catwalk is in length and allows performers to cross over the stage; it ends at a lookout which is . Cast and crew Approximately 95 people travel with the Varekai tour; 50 are artists and the rest are crew. During each engagement in a city, anywhere from 80 - 100 people are hired locally for temporary jobs during the week but mainly for load-in and load-out. The cast and crew is an international one, representing 19 nationalities. The cast of Varekai includes many unique characters. * Icarus: Innocent and vulnerable, he finds himself wounded in an unknown world. His desire to live and overcome his fears will drive him to new heights and an eventual rebirth. * The Betrothed: An exotic creature who enraptures Icarus with her sensual beauty. She will be his guiding light and he, in turn, will be the catalyst for her metamorphosis. * The Guide: Weathered by the sun of many centuries, he‚Äôs like a kindly, fragile great-grandfather‚Äîa wise old man whose mission is to inspire and bring about change. * The Skywatcher: Mad scientist and ingenious inventor, collector of the world‚Äôs memories and interpreter of signs, this is a man who receives signals, transforms sounds and forewarns of trials and tribulations. He lives perched on the edge of his laboratory-nest. * Candide * Kamikaze * L'√âcureuil * Blue Lizard * Ermite * La Toupie * Lizard * Mafioso * Magioso * Limping Angel * Clowns: A comedic duo who like to ruin the artistic flow of the show. * The Patriarch : Using his voice, he narrates his son Icarus's journey through the magical forest of Varekai. * The Muse * The Mother * Algea * Na * Water Meteor Acts *Flight of Icarus: Icarus falls from the sky into the forest of Varekai. He rises up and performs an act in an Aerial Net. *Synchronized Tumbling: Acrobatics jump, twist and turn on an inflatable mat often in perfect synchronization. This act replaced Icarian Games as of 2015. *Dance Trapeze: Suspended high above the stage, a woman performs, dances and contorts in a solo trapeze. *Magic Act: Claudio & Mooky try to perform a magic act. *Georgian Dance: This act takes its inspiration from the traditional dances of Caucasus Mountains and includes elements from several mountain dances of the region. Originally performed in the show by former soloists of Georgian State Dance Company; Badri Esatia, Temuri Koridze and Khvicha Tetvadze. *Slippery Surface: Darting and sliding on a specially designed surface, the artists fling and catch each other, creating an illusion of skating. *Lounge Singer: Claudio sings Ne Me Quitte Pas while trying to stay in the spotlight, Literally. *Solo on Crutches: Like a jointed puppet, the Limping Angel performs on crutches, sliding around the stage. One of the characters in the show. Picture taken in Melbourne. *Aerial Straps: Two performers fly above the stage, suspended by aerial straps. *Cyr Wheel: The roue Cyr involves a solo artist spinning, balancing and inversions. *Lightbulb: Always on the lookout for new inventive ways to mess or interfere in the life of the inhabitants of the forest, the Skywatcher helps the Guide in a dire situation. *Handbalancing on Canes: La Promise performs an act contorting and spinning gracefully on canes. *Russian Swing: Acrobatics fly up into the air and down onto a net, being propelled by two Russian Swings. The performers flip, jump and glide into the net, as well as jumping onto the performers shoulders, as well as jumping from one Russian swing to another. =Acts in Rotation= *Batons: A world champion baton performer throws, twirls and manipulates up to 3 batons at once while performing acrobatics. =Retired Acts= *Icarian Games: Icarian Games is one of the oldest circus arts disciplines. One of the performer lies on his back and flips, twirls and spins another performer on his feet. This act was replaced by Synchronized Tumbling in 2015. *Acrobatic Pas de Deux: Two lovers dance and perform acrobatic stunts, showing their love, trust, and respect for each other. This act was replaced by the rotational Aerial Hoop act. *Water Meteors: Three young acrobatics perform an act using water meteors, spinning and juggling them. This act was replaced by Dance Trapeze. *Triple Trapeze: Four young women perform an act on a suspended Triple Trapeze. This act was taken out when the Arena tour started. *Aerial hoop: A solo artist flies over the stage on a hoop suspended in the air in an energetic feat of acrobatics. This was a backup act from 2004, and was taken out of the show in early 2013. *Juggling: An artist manipulates bowling pins, soccer balls, hats and ping-pong balls with his hands, feet, head and even his mouth. This act was removed in 2016. Costumes Varekai's costume designer, Eiko Ishioka, set out to design the costumes to heighten the sense of risk and danger the artists face while performing their acts. The designs are an approach to give the traditional leotard a new shape. Eiko drew inspiration from the natural world: plant life, reptiles, land animals, marine life, wind, water, fire and wood. While there are over 130 costumes in the entire collection, over 600 elements combine to make the entire wardrobe of costumes, shoes, hats, and accessories. During the tour it takes a 250 hours a week to keep the costumes in a state usable for performance. This includes repairs, cleaning, pressing, repainting (shoes), ironing, and other related tasks. One of the primary materials used throughout the wardrobe is lycra, primarily for its ease of care, suppleness, and elasticity. Other materials used throughout include titanium rods, nylon sponge and other types of fire-retardant materials. La Toupie's costume, for example, is made from lycra, and the tentacles are made from polystyrene foam. In addition to textures and structures being created for the costumes, digital screen-printing was utilized for some pieces. The costumes for the Russian swing act were inspired by volcanic eruptions. Pictures were taken, scanned, processed and then digitally screen-printed to give the characters their bright red, explosive appearance. The foliage seen on the heads and backs of some characters is made from crinyl and cristalette, which are both extremely light-weight materials. Some of the translucent carapaces seen on some performers, including La Promise, are made from stretch netting mounted on a structure made of boning. Music The live music is performed by seven musicians and two singers. Composed by Violaine Corradi and directed by the bandleader/keyboard player, the music features many different genres and energies. Violaine combined the sounds of Hawaiian rituals, 11th-century French troubadour songs, traditional Armenian melodies and gospel music with contemporary arrangements to create the sound of Varekai. While some songs are quiet and sorrowful, others are more upbeat and exciting. Instruments used in the show include keyboards, bass, drums, percussion, violin, and various wind instruments. There are numerous instrumental solos, with the violin, flute, and accordion among the instruments heard. When these occur, the musician comes into view, still hidden in the trees but slightly visible to the audience.. The only cast/crew member to have performed every one of Varekai's 5,219 performances without missing a single performance is Drummer Paul James Bannerman (www.pauljbannerman.com). There are two distinct voices in the musical score. Their role is to link the story together, sometimes predicting the future, at other times, propelling the story forward. The female singer called \\"The Muse \\" (currently played by Isabelle Corradi) and the male singer called the \\"Patriarch \\" (currently played by Jamieson Lindenburg) each share the songs alternating between solos with harmonies and duos. The Muse, dressed in white & purple and The Patriarch, dressed in purple and black emerge from the forest throughout the show. =Album= Returning from her work with Cirque du Soleil's Dralion, Violaine Corradi wrote the Varekai score, which was released as a CD album on January 7, 2003. Rather than creating a literal soundtrack, Cirque du Soleil collaborated with Nitin Sawhney to produce a CD with themes and sounds from Varekai but quite differently arranged. The CD features the vocals of the two original singers of Varekai, Zara Tellander and Mathieu Lavoie; the soundtrack also includes the vocals of world music artists Natacha Atlas and Tina Grace, who were not in the production, simply featured on the album. Many of the CD tracks are dramatically different from their live counterparts. In late 2003 Cirque du Soleil created an 'Exclusive Premium Edition' CD, which featured the original CD as well as a bonus CD and DVD containing 6 live tracks, two remixes, and 2 music videos.

Cirque du Soleil released a film adaptation of Varekai on June 14, 2003, directed by Dominic Champagne and Nick Morris. The filming took place in Toronto during the show's tour and the vocalists in the filming were Zara Tellander and Mathieu Lavoie with Anton Tchelnokov as Icarus, Olga Pikhienko as La Promise/The Betrothed and John Gilkey as The Skywatcher. Tour Varekai completed its first North American tour in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on July 23, 2006. It debuted in Australia in August 2006 and arrived in New Zealand in early 2007. Later that year, Varekai finished its Australian tour in Perth, and moved on to its first European tour. At the end of 2007 the show had its European premiere in Antwerp, Belgium. It had its UK premiere in 2008 at London's Royal Albert Hall and again on 5 January 2010, marking the 25th anniversary of Cirque du Soleil. Following the European tour that cumulated in Barcelona as 2010 came to a close, the show toured to Taipei, Taiwan; Seoul, South Korea and Manila, Philippines in 2011. The Manila run was exceptional in that the show endured the monsoon season and several typhoons. In the later half of 2011 Varekai landed in S√£o Paulo and spent twelve months in Brazil before continuing to Argentina and Chile in 2013, and then Peru, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico in 2013. Guadalajara, followed by Mexico City were the final destinations for the Grand Chapiteau. Varekai performed the last performance under the Grand Chapiteau on November 24, 2013. The show then transferred to the Arena format in late 2013. The city that hosted the transformation was Bossier City, Louisiana, seen in public for the first time on December 12, 2013. After the transformation in Bossier City, Varekai played the Arena version at Centre Bell in Montreal just before Christmas in 2013, honouring the long-standing Cirque tradition of a winter show at the Centre Bell. After its 15-year run, Varekai closed in Frisco, TX on 23 December 2017. Varekai has been seen by more than 6 million spectators around the world, and has reached many milestones to accomplish this. * 1000th performance in Dallas, Texas, in 2004 * 1500th performance in Seattle, Washington, in 2006 * 2000th performance in Perth, Australia, in 2007 * 2500th performance in Seville, Spain, in February 2009 * 3000th performance in Ostend, Belgium, in August 2010 * 3500th performance in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in February 2012 * 4000th performance in Mexico City, Mexico, in October 2013 * 4500th performance in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, in June 2015 * 5000th performance in Birmingham, United Kingdom, in March 2017 Varekai has been to many different regions, here is the list of all of them. * North American Tour - [2002 - 2006] * Australian Tour - [2006 - 2007] * European Tour - [2007 - 2011] * Asia & Pacific Tour - [2011] * South American Tour - [2011 - 2013] * North American Arena Tour - [2013 - 2015] * European Arena Tour - [2015 - October 2017] * Farewell Tour - [November - December 2017] Since Varekai's premiere in 2002, it has had an extensive touring history, as detailed below.

Overview It was founded around the year 1189. At this time, L√ºttringhausen belonged to the County of Berg. In 1929, L√ºttringhausen was incorporated in the municipality of Remscheid. Remscheid prison of is in L√ºttringhausen, as well as a large Protestant psychiatric hospital called Stiftung Tannenhof.

The character has appeared in the series X-Force. His original creators were Fabian Nicieza and Matt Broome, who had completely different plans for the villain than what evolved. Creation history Originally, Fabian Nicieza had meant for Reignfire to be a time traveling, slightly older, more mentally disturbed version of Sunspot. However, when a later writer John Francis Moore took over the title he changed the original plan and came up with the explanation about the protoplasmic, amorphous origin. Fictional character biography After the events of the X-Cutioner's Song crossover event, the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF) was incarcerated and left leaderless. To fill this void came a maniacal being named Reignfire. He liberated four members of the original MLF: Forearm, Reaper, Wildside, and Tempo, and added two more to their ranks: Moonstar and Locus. He charged his team with the mission of killing Henry Peter Gyrich--a man who had always been a thorn in the side of the mutant agenda. However, their attempt was foiled by X-Force and, during the battle, the powers of Locus and Sunspot reacted together in an odd way, teleporting the pair to parts unknown. Before doing so, Reignfire says Cable's real name, a big foreshadowing technique in Nicieza's original plan. When Reignfire made his presence known, it was noticed how remarkably similar he was to Sunspot, not only in appearance but in powers as well. Since, at this time, Sunspot was missing in action (MIA), that possibility was not ruled out by Cable. His suspicions were revealed when, in the middle of a battle, Reignfire removes his mask to show that he is indeed Roberto. Cable uses his telepathic powers to forcefully remove/suppress the Reignfire persona in Sunspot, and supposedly succeeds. As an unexpected side effect, Sunspot gathered some knowledge from Cable's mind, including information about Askani -- Cable's religion and language. There were occasional moments when Sunspot would have a mental struggle to suppress evil urges, but for the most part all seems well. Later, Sunspot goes to visit his friend and former New Mutants teammate Skids in Colorado when the pair is attacked by none other than Locus and Reignfire. Although things once more go awry with Locus' powers when they come in contact with Skids' force field, the mission is generally a success as Sunspot is captured. Once shackled to the wall, Reignfire begins to tell the story of his \\"real\\" origin: he was not an evil Sunspot, which many had believed, but a clone of him created from his cellular material. He was once a protoplasmic entity possessed by the Celestials with no real form until Gideon injected a sample of Sunspot's blood into his container. With a set of genetic material to duplicate, the protoplasmic goo began to pattern itself on the DNA sample given to it and thus shared Sunspot's appearance and powers. Another added bonus was the fact that, when he was within close proximity, he could activate a telepathic link with his host and psychically imprint himself onto Sunspot‚Äîexplaining why Sunspot would sometimes seem to be evil. Reignfire wanted to kill Sunspot, but fails when several of his teammates came to his rescue. When he next appeared, it was back with the Celestials' ship. X-Force found the ship and the protoplasmic figure inside and, after a battle, Reignfire was crushed to death by a Celestial golem inside of the ship. Powers and abilities Since Reignfire was the genetic clone of Sunspot, he shared all of his abilities: absorption rechanneling of solar energy, either within his own body or externally, to create multiple abilities including, super strength, thermal updrafts for flight, projection of heat and light as concussive blasts or in a stream of fiery rain, and the ability to forge a telepathic link with his genetic host and psychically imprint himself onto his brain.

Writing career Blank studied history at Yale University, and worked as the financial editor of the largest English language newspaper of Japan, where he first immersed in an Asian culture. He later completed graduate studies in anthropology at Harvard (where he won the David L. Boren Fellowship, which provided funds for research outside the United States), and wrote his first book, Arrow of the Blue-Skinned God: Retracing the Ramayana through India in the same period. Blank has traveled extensively across India and Pakistan, and learned the ancient language of Sanskrit, as well as the languages Hindi, Gujarati and Urdu. He has also extensive knowledge and experience of the traditions and teachings of Hinduism, Islam and other religions in Asia. Blank used the Boren Fellowship to work with the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community, primarily based in the Indian city of Bombay. He was the first anthropologist to work with this usually conservative community, publishing his work in Mullahs on the Mainframe. In Jonah Blank's important, myth-shattering book, the West gets its first look at the Daudi Bohras, a unique Muslim denomination who have found the core of their religious beliefs largely compatible with modern ideology. Combining orthodox Muslim prayer, dress, and practice with secular education, relative gender equality, and Internet use, this community serves as a surprising reminder that the central values of \\"modernity\\" are hardly limited to the west.

It was manufactured in 1987 by Worlds of Wonder. The system had a very limited release outside the U.S. Gameplay Inside the system The Action Max motherboard The Action Max system requires the player to also have a VCR, as the console has no way to play the requisite VHS tapes itself. Using light guns, players shoot at the screen. The gaming is strictly point-based and dependent on shot accuracy, and, as a result, players can't truly win or lose a game. The system's post-launch appeal was limited by this and by the fact that the only real genre on the system are light gun games that play exactly the same way every time, leading to its quick market decline. Before playing, a red sensor must be attached to the lower right corner of the television screen. This corner contains a circle that was usually black, but flashes rapidly whenever something on the screen is targetable. At the same time, targets are highlighted by rapidly flashing panels for the player to shoot at. The console uses the corner circle and light from the targets (picked up by the guns) to determine when something has been hit. Flashes in sync with the corner circle count as enemy hits, and earn points for the player. Flashes out of sync with the corner circle count as friendly hits, losing points. With this implementation, the unit can function with copies of the original VHS tapes, including those on more modern formats such as DVD-R or personal computers. The console can work with any filmed footage properly formatted to function with the console's light gun.  Games  Five VHS cassettes were released for the system: *.38 Ambush Alley, a police target range; *Blue Thunder, based on the eponymous 1983 motion picture; *Hydrosub: 2021, a futuristic underwater voyage; *The Rescue of Pops Ghostly, a comic haunted- house adventure; *Sonic Fury, aerial combat, bundled with the system. A planned sixth cassette, Fright Night (possibly based on the 1985 horror film of the same name), was unreleased at the time the Action Max was discontinued. Each game follows an identical gameplay format, differing only in theme, playing the same way each time.

Background Two French armies, under two Marshals, Duc de Broglie and Prince de Soubise met up in July 1761, intending to force Prince Ferdinand out of Lippstadt, an important town. Allied reinforcements under General Sp√∂rcken arrived bringing Ferdinand's forces up to 65,000 while the combined French armies numbered around 90,000.Szabo p.352 Battle The allied Prussian-Hanoverian-British forces lined up along a series of hills, with their left anchored by the Lippe River (in the north), and the Ahse River in their centre. The French army advanced on 15 July, and Broglie's troops in the north made progress against German troops under Wutginau. However, British troops under Granby just south of Wutginau held their ground and the French assault stalled. Reinforcements for both sides arrived that night and Ferdinand strengthened his left at the expense of his right. The next morning, Broglie continued his attack on the Allied left, expecting Soubise to attack the weakened Allied right. However, Soubise only ordered a few small actions against the right, due in part that both French commanders were the same rank and reluctant to take orders from the other. Allied reinforcements under Wolff soon arrived along the Lippe River and attacked the French flank, halting Broglie's attack and forcing his men to withdraw. By about noon, the French were in full retreat and the battle was over. Aftermath Monument to the battle News of the battle provoked euphoria in Britain, and led William Pitt to take a much tougher line in the ongoing peace negotiations with France.Szabo p.353 Despite the defeat the French still had a significant superiority in numbers and continued their offensive, although the two armies split again and operated independently. Despite further attempts to push an offensive strategy in Germany, the French were pushed back and finished the war in 1762 having lost the strategic post of Cassel. The Treaty of Paris led France to evacuate the remaining German territory it had occupied during the war.

As Prince of He'nei and then Prince of Jin Liu Can was Liu Cong's son by his first wife, Empress Huyan, but was not created crown prince when Liu Cong became emperor in 310 after seizing the throne from his brother Liu He (after Liu He had tried to have him and the other brothers killed and successfully killed two), because Liu Cong had promised to and did make his brother Liu Ai (Âäâ‰πÇ), the son of his father Liu Yuan's second wife Empress Dan, crown prince. Liu Can was, however, created the Prince of He'nei and given a substantial military command. He was one of Han Zhao's major generals early in Liu Cong's reign, along with his father's cousin Liu Yao the Prince of Shi'an, Wang Mi (ÁéãÂΩå), and Shi Le. He appeared to be a competent general, although not as capable as Liu Yao or Shi Le, and he had mild successes in battle, although his campaigns were largely inconclusive. His mother Empress Huyan died in 312. As the years went, Liu Cong became increasingly trusting of Liu Can, granting him more and more authority. Liu Can was considered, during his youth, to be capable in both governance and in military matters. However, after Liu Cong made him prime minister and created the Prince of Jin in 314, he was described to have become arrogant and abusive of his powers. He became close to flatterers, not willing to listen to honest advice, unkind, and busy with construction of palaces‚Äîall traits that his father Liu Cong had displayed as well (and which Liu Can himself had, ironically, advised his father against in 312). He became very trusting of his father-in-law Jin Zhun, who was treacherous. While it might not have taken much encouragement for Liu Can to scheme against his uncle Crown Prince Ai anyway, in 316 Jin and his associate Guo Yi (ÈÉ≠Êº™) falsely told Liu Can that Crown Prince Ai was planning a rebellion, along with Liu Can's brothers Liu Fu (ÂäâÊï∑) and Liu Mai (ÂäâÂã±). Liu Can believed them, particularly after they produced false evidence that convinced Liu Cong as well. In spring 317, Liu Can finally readied his plan to eliminate his uncle Crown Prince Ai. He falsely informed Crown Prince Ai that Pingyang was under attack and that his subordinates should arm themselves to prepare for the attack. Then, Liu Can informed his father that Crown Prince Ai was ready to attack‚Äîand when Liu Cong's messengers then saw Crown Prince's associates armed, they believed Liu Can's accusations and reported back to Liu Cong. Liu Can then further interrogated Crown Prince Ai's subordinate Di and Qiang chiefs (whom Crown Prince Ai commanded, based on his secondary title of Grand Chanyu) under torture, and the Di and Qiang chiefs were forced to falsely confess to a plot. Crown Prince Ai's associates and troops were all massacred‚Äîestimated at the cost of 15,000 men‚Äîand Crown Prince Ai was deposed and subsequently assassinated by Jin. When Di and Qiang tribes subsequently revolted due to the treatment of their chiefs, Liu Cong sent Jin to suppress them, and Jin was successful. In fall 317, Liu Cong created Liu Can crown prince. Reign Liu Cong died in summer 318, and Liu Can ascended the throne. He created his wife, Crown Princess Jin, empress, and his son Liu Yuangong (ÂäâÂÖÉÂÖ¨) crown prince. He became sorely reliant on his father-in-law Jin Zhun, trusting him over all others, including his brothers. He also indulged in affairs with his father's four empresses‚ÄîJin Zhun's daughter Jin Yuehua (Èù≥ÊúàËèØ) and Empresses Fan, Xuan, and Wang, leaving all affairs of state to Jin. At Jin's suggestion, he arrested and executed his brothers Liu Ji (ÂäâÈ©•), Liu Cheng (ÂäâÈÄû), Liu Mai, along with key officials Liu Jing (ÂäâÊôØ) and Liu Yi (ÂäâÈ°ó). He further considered attacking the domain of the general Shi Le, who controlled the eastern realm, believing Shi to be treasonous. Meanwhile, after Liu Can killed those high-level officials, the trusted Jin started a coup and killed Liu Can, and then massacred the imperial Liu clan. Liu Yao would claim the Han (Zhao) throne, but Han (Zhao) would not be what it was after Liu Can's death.

Although the federation has disbanded, most of its churches still exist. They are in the United States and Canada. They confess the Bible to be the Word of God and believe it is faithfully summarized by the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort.  History  The first Orthodox Christian Reformed Church was organized in Listowel, Ontario, in 1979 by families who had left the Christian Reformed Church for doctrinal reasons, especially its Report 44.http://yinkahdinay.wordpress.com/2009/10/17/inerrancy-learn-from- history-10/ Rev.

On July 1, 1676, William Penn, Gawen Lawrie (who served from 1683 to 1686 as Deputy to Governor Robert Barclay), Nicholas Lucas and Edward Byllynge executed a deed with Sir George Carteret known as the ‚ÄúQuintipartite Deed,‚Äù in which the territory was divided into two parts, East Jersey being taken by Carteret and West Jersey by Byllynge and his trustees. Almost as soon as the Deed was signed, disputes arose over the exact dividing point of the two provinces. The first attempt at resolving the issue, the Keith line, was created by Surveyor-General George Keith in 1686, and runs North-Northwest from the southern part of Little Egg Harbor, passing just north of Tuckerton, and reaching upward to a point on the Delaware River which is just north of the Delaware Water Gap. More accurate surveys and maps were made to further resolve property disputes. This resulted in the Thornton line, drawn around 1696, and the Lawrence line, drawn around 1743, which was adopted as the final line for legal purposes. Remnants of the most operative line Keith Line can still be seen in the county boundaries between Burlington and Ocean and between Hunterdon and Somerset, as well as in a number of municipal boundaries within Mercer and Ocean counties, and the alignment of Province Line Road in Mercer County. http://www.hiddennj.com/2012/03/straddling-jerseys-on-province- line.html See also *New York ‚Äì New Jersey Line War References External links *Council of Proprietors of West Jersey ‚Äì Origin and History *New jersey Pinelands on article on the division of East and West Jersey **Where was the West Jersey/East Jersey line?

The Vatican City football association was founded in 1972. Its current president is Domenico Ruggerio. Gianfranco Guadagnoli, an Italian, is the current head coach. The team has been managed by Giovanni Trapattoni in the past. His first match as manager was played on 23 October 2010 when Vatican City faced a team composed of Italian financial police. The team played its first match in 1985, a 3‚Äì0 victory against a representative of Austrian journalists. In 2018, the Vatican also created a women's representative team. Overview Albert II, Prince of Monaco greeting team in June 2013 A carousel in the Cortile del Belvedere in 1565, 44 years after the first football match was held in the Vatican Monaco In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II established a Vatican sports department with the aim of \\"reinvigorating the tradition (of sport) within the Christian community\\". In 2006, Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone suggested that the Vatican could field a team of men from Catholic seminaries. About the prospect, the cardinal stated, \\"If we just take the Brazilian students from our Pontifical universities we could have a magnificent squad.\\" The cardinal also noted that in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, there were 42 players in the final round who attended Salesian training centres worldwide. For example, Marcelino, Spanish hero of the 1964 European Nations' Cup was a former seminarian. It was Bertone's proposal that the Vatican's players, even if accepted by UEFA, would be drawn from the population within the Catholic Church worldwide, not just citizens of Vatican City. He was unclear at the time whether the Vatican would grant these players Vatican citizenship to make this possible. With the smallest population of any nation, approximately 900, it is difficult to form a squad. The Vatican City squad consists entirely of employees of the Vatican: police officers, postal workers, government officials and members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard, the Vatican's de facto army, charged with protecting the pope. Since most Vatican citizens are members of the Swiss Guard, they cannot be amassed in large numbers for a long time. Therefore, the national team has played only a few rare international matches, often drawing a fair amount of interested press. When Vatican City played its first match in 2002, only one player, Marcello Rosati, had a Vatican passport. In 2010, Vatican City was invited to participate in the Viva World Cup by the N.F.-Board and were expected to participate but were unable to do so because they could not assemble a 15-man roster. In total, Vatican City have played only four full international matches against other nations, one draw and three defeats to Monaco in 2002, 2011, 2013, and 2014 respectively. In addition to its full international matches, the team has played a friendly match, its first, against the San Marino reserve team in 1994. The final score of that match is believed to be a 0‚Äì0 draw but Steve Menary's book 'Outcasts: The Lands that FIFA Forgot' states that Vatican insiders told him that the match ended 1‚Äì1. In 2010, the Vatican organized a team to play a friendly game against Palestine. However, the team was made up of Catholic priests and was not considered the Vatican City national team. In 2006, the Vatican City played SV Vollmond, a team from Switzerland, at Stadio Petriana with Vatican City prevailing 5‚Äì1. The team has also competed against a representative team from the Diocese of Limburg. In September 2016 the team participated in a triangular tournament at the Manlio Scopigno Stadium in Rieti to raise funds for earthquake victims. Former Italian international Simone Perrotta also participated in the tournament. In April 2019 it was announced that the team had signed its first-ever sponsor, Poderi di San Pietro, a family-owned winery in Milan. The agreement was reached after ensuring that the organization met the strict ethical criteria established by the team. Previously, the Association was approached by a sports betting organization offering a very large sponsorship but was rejected for not aligning with those ethical standards. The Vatican's stance on football Vatican footballing history began on 7 January 1521 when the first match of Calcio Fiorentino was played in the Vatican in the Cortile del Belvedere, in the presence of Pope Leo X. The first Vatican league was created in 1973 and was first won by employees of L'Osservatore Romano, the newspaper of the Holy See. The Vatican has typically expressed strong support for football. Pope John Paul II was reportedly a goalkeeper in his youth in Poland, and an ardent supporter of Cracovia Krak√≥w. The former German pope Pope Benedict XVI is an ardent supporter of Bayern Munich since his youth growing up in Bavaria, Germany. Benedict is quoted as saying, \\"The sport of football can be a vehicle of education for the values of honesty, solidarity and fraternity, especially for the younger generation.\\" In October 2007, the Pope was presented with a #16 shirt (in reference to the sixteenth use of his papal name) by Serie B side Ancona after Benedict supported their initiative to become a \\"beacon of morality\\" by adopting an \\"innovative, ethical model of practising football\\". In 2010, Benedict and the Vatican reaffirmed their belief that football should be a beacon of morality by lashing out at Serie A after matches for the upcoming season were scheduled at 12:30pm on Sundays to appease pay-per-view companies wishing to spread out Serie A matches over the weekend. The Vatican previously questioned the league's decision to play matches on Sundays at all, but \\"I consider this a truly harmful development,\\" Monsignor Carlo Mazza told Tuttosport. \\"Putting people in front of the television screen at 12.30 CET, when they are having lunch with their families, to me seems like a 'pitch invasion' on life.\\" Additionally, on 18 December 2006, Tarcisio Bertone, Cardinal Secretary of State of the Holy See, stated, but only in jest, that he did not preclude the possibility that the Vatican, in the future, could put together a football team of great value, that could play on the same level as, Roma, Internazionale and Milan or Genoa. The current Argentinian pope, Pope Francis is an ardent fan of his hometown club San Lorenzo, and exhibited disappointment when Argentina lost the 2014 World Cup final against Germany. FIFA membership The Vatican is one of only nine fully recognized sovereign states whose national team is not a FIFA member. The others are the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, and the United Kingdom (though the UK's four \\"home countries\\" (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) have individual FIFA teams each of which is also a member of the IFAB). In 2006 UEFA spokesperson William Gaillard told a media outlet that he saw no reason why the Vatican should not have a national team in international competitions. He said, \\"We already have states of 30,000 citizens like San Marino, Liechtenstein, and Andorra. If the Vatican wants to become a member of UEFA all it has to do is apply. If it meets the requirements, it will be accepted\\". At that time Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone insisted that the Vatican's football future lies only in amateur games and competitions. In May 2014, Domenico Ruggerio, president of the national football association, reinforced Bertone's words from eight years prior, stating that \\"I prefer to be amateur...To join FIFA, at that level, will be like a business\\" after stating \\"The important message of friendship and love is demonstrated by the sport ‚Äî the real sport, not the business that is in football these days...It is not just important to win a match; it is how you carry yourself.\\" Therefore, that, he added, meant that \\"the ethos of the Vatican‚Äôs soccer team was, at odds with FIFA membership.\\" In an April 2019 interview Danilo Zennaro, football director of the Vatican, told the St. Galler Tagblatt that the association would also not seek membership in an alternate confederation like ConIFA because of \\"political reasons\\" such as the diplomatic strife that would ensue from being in the same organization as breakaway regions and disputed territories.

He was also a Congressman from Maine and served as Arizona Territory's delegate to the United States House of Representatives. Background Goodwin was born on October 18, 1824, in South Berwick, Maine, to John and Mary (Noble) Goodwin. He was educated at Berwick Academy and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1844. Following graduation, Goodwin studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1848. He then began a law practice in South Berwick. Goodwin married Susan Howard Robinson of Augusta, Maine, on October 27, 1857. The couple had three children, Susie Robinson, Richard Emery, and Howard Robinson, the youngest born on November 7, 1863. Maine Goodwin began his political career in 1854 with his election to the Maine Senate. This was followed in 1860 with a successful run for the U.S. House of Representatives. Though considered hard-working and likable with a moderate approach, Goodwin's single term as a Congressman was described as \\"undistinguished\\". He was defeated by 127 votes in his 1862 reelection bid. Following his defeat, Goodwin began looking for another federal posting. He was supported in the effort by U.S. Senators William P. Fessenden and Lot M. Morrill, both of Maine, along with several former colleagues from the House of Representatives. On March 6, 1863, following passage of the Arizona Organic Act, President Lincoln appointed Goodwin as Chief Justice of Arizona Territory. When John A. Gurley, Lincoln's initial appointee for Governor of Arizona Territory, died on August 19, 1863, Goodwin was selected to fill the open position. Governorship The Goodwin Governor's House known as the Old Governor's MansionInside the \\"Old Governor's Mansion\\"Inside another room of the \\"Old Governor's Mansion\\" The Governor's party, consisting of most of Arizona's appointed officials, left Washington, D.C., for Fort Leavenworth. They then took the Santa Fe Trail, arriving in Santa Fe, New Mexico on November 26, 1863. The party then crossed into Arizona, and on December 29, 1863 held a ceremony at Navajo Springs to formally establish the Arizona Territory and administer oaths of office to the territorial officials. As Congress had not specified the location of the territorial capital, it fell to Goodwin to select an initial location. Tucson as the largest settlement in the territory had been considered a likely location, but based upon the recommendation of General James H. Carleton who viewed Tucson as full of Mexicans and Confederate sympathizers, Fort Whipple was instead selected. The governor and his party reached Fort Whipple on January 22, 1864. Shortly after establishing the temporary capital, Goodwin set out with a military escort on a tour of the new territory. The purpose of the tour was to familiarize the governor with his new territory and to search for suitable locations for a more permanent capital. The mining district near Fort Whipple was seen first, followed by the areas around the Verde and Salinas rivers. In April and May, he was in southern Arizona. Following this tour, Goodwin decided to place the new capital at a site near Granite Creek, roughly 20 miles south of Fort Whipple's location. The military camp was moved and on May 30, 1864 the new capital was named Prescott at a public meeting. Goodwin's duties encompassed dividing the territory into judicial districts and appointing a variety of officials to conduct governmental tasks. Following an initial census overseen by U.S. Marshal Milton B. Duffield, the governor proclaimed an election for the selection of a territorial legislature and delegate to Congress would occur on July 18, 1864. When the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature convened, Goodwin called for immediate removal of peonage and imprisonment for debt from the set of laws Arizona had inherited from New Mexico Territory along with creation of a commission to create a new legal code for Arizona. The governor also asked the legislature to minimize the number of appointed officials, combining multiple part-time positions into a single full-time position where practical. Other topics Goodwin raised with the legislature were taxation and location of the territorial capital. To deal with the Apache and other tribes, Goodwin called for assistance from the U.S. Army along with creation of a volunteer force to combat the hostiles. A force of 350 men and 11 officers was raised and divided into five companies. For peaceful tribes, the governor called for Congress to create reservations along the Colorado river and appropriate funds to build irrigation systems. Other efforts Goodwin pursued were establishment of postal routes and creation of schools. Territorial delegate Goodwin was elected to be Arizona Territory's delegate to the 39th United States Congress on September 6, 1865, defeating incumbent Charles D. Poston in the process. Soon after, Goodwin left for Washington D. C. leaving Richard C. McCormick behind as acting governor. The new delegate did not reach the floor of Congress till January 17, 1866. During the period lasting until McCormick's appointment as governor, Goodwin collected two salaries and did not respond to requests for return of the overpayment for the U.S. Treasury Department. During his time as a delegate, Goodwin submitted several bills calling for troops to fight hostile Indians, creation of additional postal routes. He also spoke out against the transfer of Pah-Ute County from Arizona Territory to Nevada. Goodwin did not seek re-election in 1866. Later life Following his time as territorial Delegate, Goodwin moved to New York City to be closer to his business interests. He served as Vice-President of the Tiger Mill and Mining Company of New York by the early 1880s. Goodwin died on April 29, 1887 at Paraiso Springs in Monterey County, California, where he had gone for health reasons. He was buried in Forest Grove Cemetery in Augusta, Maine.

The patron saint of artists and against temptations, Catherine de' Vigri was venerated for nearly three centuries in her native Bologna before being formally canonized in 1712. Her feast day is 9 March. Life Catherine came from an upper class family, the daughter of Benvenuta Mammolini of Bologna and Giovanni Vigri, a Ferrarese notary who worked for Niccol√≤ III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. She was raised at Niccolo III's court as a lady- in-waiting to his wife Parisina Malatesta (d. 1425) and became lifelong friends with his natural daughter Margherita d‚ÄôEste (d. 1478).Arthur, Kathleen G. (2005) \\"Il breviario di Santa Caterina da Bologna e 'l'arte povera' Clarissa\\", I monasteri femminili come Centri di Cultura fra Rinascimento e Barocco, ed. G. Pomata & G. Zarri, pp. 93‚Äì122. During this time, she received some education in reading, writing, music, playing the viola, and had access to illuminated manuscripts in the d'Este Court library.Arthur, Kathleen G. (2018) Women, Art and Observant Franciscan Piety, (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press), pp. 71‚Äì76 In 1426, after Niccolo III's execution of Parisina d'Este for infidelity, Catherine left court and joined a lay community of beguines living a semi-religious life and following the Augustinian rule. The women were divided over whether instead to adhere to the Franciscan rule, which eventually happened. In 1431 the beguine house was converted into the Observant Poor Clare convent of Corpus Domini, which grew from 12 women in 1431 to 144 women by the end of the century.Lombardi, P. Teodosio (1975). I Francescani a Ferrara, IV (Bologna: Dehone), pp. 63‚Äì277. Sister Caterina lived at Corpus Domini, Ferrara most of her life from 1431 to 1456, serving as Mistress of Novices. She was a model of piety and experienced miracles and several visions of Christ, the Virgin Mary, Thomas Becket, and St. Joseph, as well as future events, such as the fall of Constantinople in 1453. She wrote a number of religious treatises, lauds, sermons, and copied and illustrated her own breviary (see below). In 1455 the Franciscans and the governors of Bologna requested that she become abbess of a new convent, which was to be established under the name of Corpus Domini in Bologna. She left Ferrara in July 1456 with 12 sisters to start the new community and remained abbess there until her death on 9 March 1463. Caterina was buried in the convent graveyard, but after eighteen days, a sweet smell emanated from the grave and the incorrupt body was exhumed. It was eventually relocated to a chapel where it remains on display, dressed in her religious habit, seated upright behind glass. A contemporary Poor Clare, Sister Illuminata Bembo, wrote her biography in 1469.Bembo, ed. Silvia Mostaccio (2001) Specchio di Illuminazione,(Florence: SISMEL). A strong local Bolognese cult of Caterina Vigri developed and she became a Beata in the 1520s but was not canonized until 1712. Literary works Sette armi spirituali, 1475 Catherine‚Äôs best known text is Seven Spiritual Weapons Necessary for Spiritual WarfareLe Sette Armi Spirituali which she appears to have first written in 1438 and then rewritten and augmented between 1450 and 1456. Although she probably taught similar ideas, she kept the written version hidden until she neared death, and then handed it to her confessor with instructions to send a copy to the Poor Clares at Ferrara. Part of this book describes at length her visions both of God and of Satan. The treatise was circulated in manuscript form through a network of Poor Clare convents. The Sette Armi Spirituali became an important part of the campaign for her canonization. It was first printed in 1475, and went through 21 later editions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including being translated in Latin, French, Portuguese, English, Spanish, and German. It therefore played an important role in the dissemination of late medieval vernacular mysticism in the early modern period. In addition, she wrote lauds, short religious treatises and letters,Vigri, ed. Serventi, Silvia (2006) Caterina Vigri, Laudi, Trattati e Lettere, (Florence: SISMEL) as well as a 5000-line Latin poem called the Rosarium Metricum,Vigri, ed. Sgarbi, Gilberto (1997). Rosarium Metricum. Poema del XV Secolo (Bologna: Giorgio Barghigiani). the I Dodici Giardini and I Sermoni.Vigri, ed. Sgarbi, Gilberto (1999), I Sermoni (Bologna: Giorgio Barghigiani). These were discovered around 2000 and described by Cardinal Giacomo Biffi: as \\"now revealed in their surprising beauty. We can ascertain that she was not undeserving of her renown as a highly cultivated person. We are now in a position to meditate on a veritable monument of theology which, after the Treatise on the Seven Spiritual Weapons, is made up of distinct and autonomous parts: The Twelve Gardens, a mystical work of her youth, Rosarium, a Latin poem on the life of Jesus, and The Sermons, copies of Catherine's words to her religious sisters.\\" Artistic works Madonna and Child, a work previously attributed to Catherine of Bologna Vigri represents the rare phenomenon of a 15th-century nun‚Äìartist whose artworks are preserved in her personal breviary.Fortunati, Vera & C. Leonardi. (2004). Pregare con le Immagini, (Florence, SISMEL). She meditated while she copied the scriptural text, adding about 1000 prayer rubrics, and drew initials with bust-portraits of saints, paying special attention to images of Saints Clare and Francis.Arthur, Kathleen G. (2004). \\"Images of Clare and Francis in Caterina Vigri's Personal Breviary\\", Franciscan Studies 62, pp. 177‚Äì192. Besides multiple images of Christ and the infant swaddled Christ Child, she depicted other saints, including Thomas Becket, Jerome, Paul, Anthony of Padua, Mary Magdalene, her name saint Catherine of Alexandria. Her self-taught style incorporated motifs from needlework and devotional prints. Some saints' images, interwoven with text and rubrics, display an idiosyncratic, inventive iconography also found in German nuns' artworks (n√∂nnenarbeiten).Arthur (2018), Women, Art and Observant Franciscan Piety, pp. 86‚Äì118. The breviary and its images surely served a didactic function within the convent community.Faberi, Mariafiamma (2013). \\"La Pedagogia dell'immagine nelle miniature e negli scritti di S. Caterina Vigri\\", Dalla Corte al Chiostro eds. Clarisse di Ferrara, P. Messa, F. Sedda (Assisi: Edizioni Porziuncola), pp. 177‚Äì200. Other panel paintings and manuscripts attributed to her include the Madonna and Child (nicknamed the Madonna del Pomo) in the Cappella della Santa, a possible portrait or self-portrait (?) in the autograph copy of the Sette Armi Spirituali, a Redeemer, and another Madonna and Child in her chapel.Wood, Jeryldene M. (1996). Women, Art, and Spirituality. The Poor Clares of Early Modern Italy, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 121‚Äì144, 196‚Äì197. Recently scholars have rejected these artworks either based on style or scientific examination of materials, and called her reputation as a painter \\"more legendary than fact\\".Biancani, Stefania (2002). \\"La leggenda della monaca artista: Caterina Vigri\\", Vita artistica nel monastero femminile. exempla, ed. V. Fortunati (Bologna: Editrice Compositore), pp. 203‚Äì219. A drawing of a Man of Sorrows or Resurrected Christ found in a miscellany of lauds (Ms. 35 no.4, Archivio Generale Arcivescovile, Bologna) has also been attributed to her. Vigri is significant as a woman artist who articulated an aesthetic philosophy. She explained that although it took precious time, the purpose of her religious art was \\"to increase devotion for herself and others\\".Arthur (2018), Women, Art and Observant Franciscan Piety, pp. 86‚Äì118.

He versified the story of Vis and RƒÅmin, a story from the Arsacid (Parthian) period. The Iranian scholar Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, however, disagrees with this view, and concludes that the story has its origins in the 5th-century Sasanian era. Besides Vis and RƒÅmin, he composed other forms of poetry. For example, some of his quatrains are recorded in the Nozhat al-Majales.  Biography  Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani was born in Jorjan or Gorgan (Persian: ⁄Øÿ±⁄ØÿßŸÜ, also Romanized as GorgƒÅn, central city of Hyrcania in north of Iran. Gurgani accompanied the Seljuq ruler Tughril during his campaigns in Iran. When Tughril seized the major Iranian city of Isfahan from the Kakuyids in 1051, he appointed a certain Amid Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar as its governor. Gurgani thereafter settled in Isfahan, where he established good relations with its governor, who took him under his protection. One day, when Gurgani and Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar were talking, Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar asked the following question: ‚ÄúWhat do you say about the tale of Vis and RƒÅmin?‚Äù Gurgani then told him that the story was only written in Middle Persian. Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar then asked Gurgani to versify the story, which he did; during the Mehregan festival, Gurgani presented the poem to him, in which he praises Tughril, the vizier Abu Nasr Kunduri, and Abu'l-Fath Muzaffar. Gurgani died .  Influence  \\"The two lovers.\\" A Persian miniature painting by Reza Abbasi. The Vis and Ramin story had a noticeable influence on Persian literature.

Accessed on April 4, 2010. The romance also has had its influence beyond Persian culture. The story became very popular also in Georgia through a 12th-century free translation in prose known as Visramiani, which had a long-lasting effect on the Georgian literature. Being the oldest known manuscript of the work and better preserved than the original, it is of great importance for the history of the Persian text and helps restore several corrupted lines in the Persian manuscripts.Gvakharia, Aleksandre \\"Georgia IV: Literary contacts with Persia\\"], in: Encyclopaedia Iranica Online Edition. Accessed on April 4, 2010 at Some scholars have suggested that Vis and Ramin may have influenced the Tristan and Iseult legend, and the two plots have distinct resemblances.

It tells the story of Dan Saxon, an undercover cop who infiltrates a group of criminal outlaw bikers behind a drug-smuggling and arms-dealing operation. In order to maintain their trust, he must commit ever more dangerous and heinous crimes and must question how far he can go beyond the law. The film stars Charlie Sheen, Linda Fiorentino, and Michael Madsen. Plot Based on a true story, the film centers on Dan Saxon, a cop with a troubled childhood. He is enlisted by Conroy Price, an agent in Arizona's State Attorney General's office, to go undercover to bust the illegal drugs and arms trafficking. Saxon is unsuccessful until he meets and befriends Virgil, a mechanic who introduces him to the seedy world of criminal bikers. Virgil tutors Saxon on bikes and customs of the \\"outlaw motorcycle brotherhood.\\" After many lessons and a major change in appearance Saxon develops an alter ego named Sid and ends up infiltrating the Jackals and earning the trust of Blood, their president. At the same time, he begins a relationship with a photojournalist, Renee Jason, who is aware of his dual life. As Saxon falls deeper into this world of crime, he becomes more unbalanced. After a violent situation that led to the murder of a 20-year-old convenience store attendant, Saxon is brought back to earth. Saxon's Identity is revealed, by Price, to the local, state, and federal law enforcement, much to their praise for Saxon's undercover skills. Concluding the undercover operation, over 200 arrests are made including Blood. The end of the film shows Saxon walking into the desert. It is revealed in the narrated epilogue that Saxon and Renee are living in California, and Blood is serving 3 consecutive life sentences.

The film stars Sophie Vavasseur in the title role, Pierce Brosnan as her father and Aidan Quinn, Julianna Margulies, Stephen Rea and Alan Bates as supporters to Doyle's case. The film had a limited release in the United States, starting on December 13, 2002 and was later followed by the United Kingdom release on March 21, 2003. The film was produced by Brosnan's own production company, Irish DreamTime, and others. It opened to positive reviews. Plot Nine-year-old Evelyn Doyle (Sophie Vavasseur) and her two brothers, Maurice (Hugh MacDonagh) and Dermot (Niall Beagan) are motherless when their mother abandons the marriage to a drunkard out-of-work father Desmond Doyle (Pierce Brosnan). When Desmond's mother-in-law (Claire Mullan) reports the situation to the authorities, a judge decides the children are prohibited by law to being left in broken homes; they are placed in Church-run orphanages. Evelyn's grandfather (Frank Kelly) takes her to the girls orphanage and explains to her that rays of light created by the sun shining in a specific spot through the clouds are called \\"angel rays\\"; they indicate that a guardian angel is watching over her. Evelyn finds when she enters the orphanage that conditions are harsh and many have been there for years. Desmond finds little hope in regaining custody of his children because he cannot afford a lawyer, turns to drink and assaults Father O'Malley. The father punches Desmond. Desmond is helped by the local part-time bartender and chemist, Bernadette (Julianna Margulies). Bernadette tells Desmond to go for help at her brother Michael's (Stephen Rea) office, a solicitor. He makes it clear to Desmond that he cannot help him until he gets his act together‚Äîregular income and orderly life. Desmond finds decorating jobs and spends nights singing for tips with his father in the pub where Bernadette works. Desmond reads in a letter of Evelyn that she has not been adjusting well with Sister Bridget (Andrea Irvine) who beat her when the Sister's authority was questioned. Evelyn objected to Sister Bridget beating her friend who forgot Bible scripture, although the Bible scripture stated that \\"God is merciful\\" therefore God would not want Sister Bridget to beat the children for forgetting scripture. While seeking out Evelyn, he finds and shakes the Sister while threatening her never to touch his daughter again or he will \\"tear her limb from limb.\\" Desmond returns to drink and after several rampages Bernadette refuses to continue her relationship with him since he needs to shape up. Desmond reforms. The American Nick Barron (Aidan Quinn), and the injured rugby player and rebel lawyer Thomas Connolly (Alan Bates) argue Desmond's court plea for regaining custody of his children; it is rejected and no course of appeal until they decide to bring before the plea is rejected by the courts leading Desmond and his children heartbroken and separated. But, that night (the same night Desmond quits drinking) a gambler rigs Desmond to win copious amounts of money to pay for his legal bills. With nowhere to go though, the case seems hopeless until Connolly comes up with the idea of bringing an entirely new issue to the Supreme Court that the lack of the children's custody by a parent is contrary to the Irish Constitution‚Äîan issue never successfully argued before the Court. It takes public pressure for the case to be heard before the Court. Desmond gives compelling testimony. The following day, Evelyn says in court that she told a false story about her bruised face because Sister Bridget exaggerated her interaction with Desmond. Evelyn works herself into a pickle when Angel rays come into the court through the windows‚Äîa sign to her that her grandfather was watching over her. She recants her newly expressed explanation with comebacks that make people chuckle. She then finishes it off with a recitation of a prayer asking to forgive Sister Bridget and ensure the prospering of Ireland and its people. Two of the three judges side with Desmond, the children are returned to him and he falls in love with Bernadette. They are shown on Christmas Day, celebrating as a family. Historical accuracy Survivors of the industrial schools have criticised the claim in the credits of the film that changes in Irish law resulting from the case led to children being reunited with their families.

The station is linked to Higashi-Narita Station by a 500 m underground passage. The station serves both Terminal 2 and the nearby Terminal 3.

There is a common concourse on level B1F of the main Terminal 2 building and then platforms below, using double track originally intended for the Narita Shinkansen. There is a security checkpoint between the station exit and the terminal building where identification (such as a passport) must be shown and baggage may be inspected. The security checkpoint is only connected to the Keisei side of the station, so JR passengers disembarking at this station go through two ticket gates: one between the JR and Keisei stations, and one exiting the Keisei station. A future renovation of the station is planned to streamline the exit process for JR passengers. =JR East= JR East uses the northern platform, which is to the side of a single track used for both inbound and outbound trains. =Keisei Electric Railway= Keisei uses the southern platform, a single island platform divided in half crosswise by a metal fence to form four numbered tracks. Tracks 1 and 2, on the eastern half of the platform, are used for Narita Sky Access trains including the Skyliner limited express service. Tracks 3 and 4, on the western half of the platform, are used for Keisei Main Line trains. Passengers not using the Narita Sky Access Line must pass through a second ticket barrier prior to entering the platforms in order to enforce the separate fare structure for Narita Sky Access trains. Platform 3, used for Keisei Main Line trains bound for Tokyo, is only long enough to accommodate six cars; therefore two cars of each eight- car Keisei Main Line trainset open onto Track 1, the Tokyo-bound Narita Sky Access Line platform. Keisei has installed special signage in this section of Track 1 to warn passengers not to board these cars. Adjacent stations History Narita Airport Terminal 2¬∑3 Station opened on 3 December 1992, shortly prior to the opening of Terminal 2 itself. The second track for Keisei trains opened on 14 November 2009, as part of the construction project for the Narita Sky Access Line.

ShowShifter offered features such as TV recording, PVR facilities, EPG, audio and video Jukebox, and a picture viewer from within a user interface designed to be used by a remote control at a comfortable viewing distance from the video display, hence the term 10-foot user interface. History ShowShifter is widely regarded as the original home theater PC software application but is no longer commercially available. It is notable in that it was the first publicly downloadable software to attempt to do this and as such defined this market for years to come. It is often acknowledged as the inspiration for Microsoft's Windows XP Media Center Edition. ShowShifter first appeared on the market in June 2000 and was the first Media Center application available for download by end users. It was created by Edinburgh-based developer Home Media Networks Ltd. ShowShifter initially supported analogue cards compressing to AVI and WMV formats in software but version 3 (now called ShowShifter DVB) added support for DVB and Hauppauge WinTV-PVR cards. In May 2005 Home Media Networks Limited was acquired by SkyNet Global an Australian home networking venture for an undisclosed sum. Shortly afterwards SkyNet ran into financial difficulties, changed corporate direction and took the decision to wind up Home Media Networks as it was no longer fitted into their core strategy. Future Following liquidation ShowShifter source IP rights were acquired by a number of groups. Codevio, a venture consisting of the original ShowShifter founders, acquired both ShowShifter source IP plus the brand name and website. They are now providing custom software development services for DirectShow, VLC and GStreamer as well as licensing out components from the ShowShifter IP portfolio.

He also served as the first and fourth President of the House of Deputies for the General Convention of the Episcopal Church (1785, 1789).Barnes, C. Rankin, \\"The General Convention Offices and Officers 1785-1950\\" Education and ordination Born in Philadelphia, White began his education at Philadelphia College (which was later known as the University of Pennsylvania), taking his B.A. in 1765 and his A.M. about three years later. In 1770, he sailed for England on the ship Britannia, for his ordination as a deacon by Philip Yonge, Bishop of Norwich (but with the authorisation of Richard Terrick, Bishop of London), which took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace on December 23, 1770. He subsequently returned to England on two occasions: once in 1772, to be ordained priest (again at the Chapel Royal, by Terrick on April 17), and again in 1787, when he was consecrated bishop on February 4 at Lambeth Palace Chapel by John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury; William Markham, Archbishop of York; Charles Moss, Bishop of Bath and Wells; and John Hinchliffe, Bishop of Peterborough. In 1781, after further theological studies, he received a Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of Pennsylvania. =Consecrators= * John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury * William Markham, Archbishop of York * Charles Moss, Bishop of Bath and Wells * John Hinchliffe, Bishop of Peterborough William White was the second bishop consecrated for the Episcopal Church of the United States. Samuel Seabury of Connecticut had been first, consecrated in 1784 on Aberdeen, Scotland. Ministry Rector of St. Peter's and of Christ Church for 57 years, White also served as Chaplain of the Continental Congress from 1777 to 1789, and subsequently as Chaplain of the Senate. Though an Anglican (Episcopalian) cleric who was sworn to the king in his ordination ceremony, White, like all but one of his fellow Anglican clerics in Philadelphia, sided with the American revolutionary cause.Only William Stringer, a recent immigrant form Ireland in 1773, remained a Loyalist among the Anglican clerics in Philadelphia. In a Letter to Lord Dartmouth on March 6, 1778, from Philadelphia, Stringer reports that he is the only clergyman in Philadelphia who has acted consistent with his ordination oath of allegiance to the King and duty as a minister. See The Manuscripts of the Earl of Dartmouth, Volume 2, p. 460. After the war, White wrote The Case of The Episcopal Churches in the United States Considered, a pamphlet that laid out the foundational thinking for the emerging Episcopal Church. Among the innovations he proposed (and which were eventually adopted) was including lay people in the church's decision making bodies. Thus, at the founding General Convention of the Episcopal Church in 1785, the House of Deputies was composed of both lay and clergy members.Manross, William. A History of the American Episcopal Church After his consecration in England, White helped create an American episcopate, participating in the consecration of Thomas John Clagett as Bishop of Maryland at the General Convention in 1792, as well as serving as the Episcopal Church's first and fourth Presiding Bishop (the latter time as the most senior of bishops, as became the custom for the next century). White participated in the consecration of most American Episcopal bishops during the country's first two decades. He also consecrated two African-Americans as deacons and then priests, Absalom Jones of Philadelphia (in 1795 and 1804, respectively), and William Levington of New York (who became missionary to free and enslaved African Americans in the South and established St.James Episcopal Church in Baltimore circa 1824). Although White did not travel extensively through his diocese, he did support missionary priests, including: Simon Wilmer, who traveled through Pennsylvania and New Jersey and ultimately settled down in what became the Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C.); William Meade, who traveled extensively throughout Virginia and ultimately became its bishop, White participating in his consecration; and Jackson Kemper, first in Philadelphia for 2 decades, founded the Society for the Advancement of Christianity and became the Episcopal Church's first missionary bishop. The elderly White made only one trip to the western parts of his diocese. In 1825 he traveled with Kemper to western Pennsylvania confirming 212 and consecrating three buildings. On that trip, with permission of Richard Channing Moore, Bishop of Virginia, he also visited Wheeling, West Virginia in what much later became West Virginia to confirm parishioners and consecrate St. Matthew's Church.http://www.episcopalpgh.org/archives/resources/exhibits/forming-the- diocese/margins/1825-2/; http://www.stmatts.com/index.php/our- history/founding-years White also took an active role in creating several charitable and educational institutions, usually by organizing Presbyterians, Methodists and other Protestants in those philanthropic enterprises.David B. Contosta, This Far by Faith: Tradition and Change in the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania (Penn. State Press, 2012), p. 88 In 1785, White founded the Episcopal Academy, to educate the sons of Philadelphia's Episcopalians and others. In 1795, White raised funds to create a school (built on Race Street between 4th and 5th) for black and Native American children. He also helped to create a Magdalen Society in Philadelphia in 1800 for \\"unhappy females who have been seduced from the paths of virtue and are desirous of returning to a life of rectitude.\\" This was the first institution of this kind in the United States.See http://www.hsp.org/files/findingaid2016magdalensociety.pdf(See also: Magdalene asylum) In 1820, White joined prominent Philadelphia philanthropists who, in 1820, convinced the Pennsylvania legislature to fund the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, founded by rabbi David G. Seixas, now known as the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. White served as the school's president for the next 16 years. He also ministered to Philadelphia's prisoners, becoming the first president of the Philadelphia Society for the Alleviation of Miseries of Public Prisons, which attracted the participation of numerous Quakers. Not known for his oratory (but for quiet sardonic wit), White earned Philadelphians' esteem for his erudition and ongoing charitable works, especially during the multiple outbreaks of yellow fever in that city throughout the 1790s. White and his friend and neighbor Benjamin Rush were among the few prominent citizens who remained to tend the ill when many other wealthy inhabitants fled to the countryside. As White aged, arranging for his successor became divisive in the diocese. Benjamin Allen arrived from Virginia to lead the diocese's most evangelical congregation, St. Paul's and also founded another congregation, St. Andrew's, without White's permission. White questioned certain aspects of lay leadership at the revival meetings. Allen and the evangelical party selected George Boyd to replace White's assistant James Abercrombie, and Allen in place of Kemper at the diocesan council. When they tried to elect Meade as White's coadjutor (assistant bishop with right of succession) over White's preferred candidate (Bird Wilson, a professor at General Theological Seminary but canonically resident in Pennsylvania), the diocesan convention ended in a deadlock.Contosta pp. 135-138. At the next Convention, Wilson took himself out of contention, as did Meade, and the divided delegates eventually selected Henry Onderdonk (of Brooklyn, New York; who preferred High Church practices but had also revitalized that congregation). White was a member of the American Philosophical Society, along with many other prominent Philadelphians, including Benjamin Franklin, as well as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania from 1774 until his death. During his tenure as trustee, he also served as Treasurer (1775‚Äì1778) and President (1790‚Äì1791) of the Board of Trustees. Family connections and private life White in about 1830 White was married to Mary Harrison (1750‚Äì1797). Mary's father, Henry Harrison, had also been the Mayor of Philadelphia from 1762‚Äì1763. The Whites had eight children, only three of whom survived to adulthood. As a widower, White supported seven of his grandchildren. In 1813, the bishop's widowed daughter Elizabeth brought her two daughters to live in the house. Elizabeth, called \\"Betsy\\" by the family, managed the household for nearly twenty years until her death in 1831. After the death of the Whites' son-in-law and daughter Mary, White and Betsy brought his five grandchildren (through Mary) into his home where they lived for the ten years leading up to his death. White's younger sister Mary was married to Robert Morris, who was known as the \\"Financier of the Revolution\\" for securing funding for the colonial cause. White's household included a free African American coachman, named John, but no slaves.See http://www.independenceparkinstitute.com/inp/bishop_white/servants.htm A lengthy obituary devoted to White in the National Gazette and Literary Register described him thus: > ... [T]he duties of the several important relations in which he stood to > society were performed with undeviating correctness and suavity; he > possessed the rare merit of winning the respect and love of an entire > community to which he was an ornament and a blessing. His piety was deep and > unfeigned; his walking humble yet dignified; his acquirements profound; in > his mind the welfare of the Christian church was always the prominent > consideration ... He was one of those examples of steady virtue sent upon > earth by Divine providence, as if to prove how near the great pattern of > perfection it is permitted to approach.National Gazette and Literary > Register, (July 19, 1836) White died at his home after a lingering illness, retaining his full mental faculties until the end. He was buried in the family vault at Christ Church Burial Ground on July 20, 1836, next to his brother-in-law, Robert Morris. On December 23, 1870 his remains were re-interred in the chancel of Christ Church. Bishop White House Bishop William White House His home at 309 Walnut Street in Philadelphia is today part of Independence National Historical Park. It is notable, in part, as one of the first houses to have an indoor \\"necessary,\\" at a time when most privies were built outside of houses. The prominent physician Benjamin Rush lived next door. A second Bishop White House is located on Old Mill Lane, in the Historic District in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania. White sent his family to this house in 1793, during the Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic. Though his family lived there and he visited the house, White generally remained in Philadelphia.Rose Valley History accessed 2011-01-13 Veneration White is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on July 17. Quote In White's response of August 15, 1835 to Colonel Mercer of Fredericksburg, Virginia, he writes: > In regard to the subject of your inquiry, truth requires me to say that > General Washington never received the communion in the churches of which I > am the parochial minister. Mrs. Washington was an habitual communicant ... I > have been written to by many on that point, and have been obliged to answer > them as I now do you. This letter is one piece of evidence among many which are frequently cited in support of Washington's deist or even atheist beliefs. Although Washington never received communion there, he attended services at Christ Church regularly for about 25 years.

Posing as a Canadian businessman, he was an illegal resident spy during the Cold War and the mastermind of the Portland Spy Ring, which operated in England from the late 1950s until 1961. The true Gordon Lonsdale A person by the name of Gordon Arnold Lonsdale was born on 27 August 1924 in Cobalt, Ontario, Canada. His father Emmanuel Jack Lonsdale was a miner. His mother Olga Elina Bousa had immigrated from Finland. The Lonsdales separated in 1931. A year later, Olga took her 8-year-old son with her back to her native Finland. He is believed to have died c. 1943 and the Soviets obtained his papers for use by their agents.Tietjen, Arthur (1961) Soviet Spy Ring. Pan Books. The actual Gordon Lonsdale was recorded as having been circumcised; the imposter was not. Molody's early life Konon Molody was born in Moscow in 1922, the son of a scientist and his wife. His father died when he was a child. According to Konon's son, Trofim Molody, who wrote a book about his father, Soviet intelligence already had their eyes on the young boy. (\\"The Dead Season. End of the Legend\\", 1998) The NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda helped Konon's mother get a passport for him to go to the US in 1934 to live with an aunt in California, a dance teacher named Tatiana Piankova. He was a pupil at the A to Zed School in Berkeley between 1936 and 1938. (According to his official SVR biography, he left the USSR in 1932). Molody returned to the Soviet Union in 1938, having learned English and became aware of United States culture.–ú–æ–ª–æ–¥—ã–π –ö–æ–Ω–æ–Ω –¢—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á Molody's biography on the SVR (Foreign Intelligence Service) web site. In October 1940, he was conscripted and served as an intelligence officer during World War II. After the war, in 1946, Molody became a student at the Law Department of the Institute of Foreign Trade, where he studied Chinese. Spying career In 1951 he was recruited to the Soviet foreign intelligence service of the KGB and trained as an \\"illegal\\" spy. He married and had two children. In 1953, Molody travelled to Canada on a Soviet merchant ship, using a passport issued in the name of \\"Gordon Lonsdale\\". The true Lonsdale had died in the early 1940s in Finland, as discussed above. The Soviets had used Finland's public records to establish identities for some of their spies. They took possession of the records after the war. From Canada, \\"Gordon Lonsdale\\" went to the US. There the atomic spy, Rudolph Abel helped to develop his espionage skills. He also first met Morris and Lona Cohen (whose cover names in the UK were Peter and Helen Kroger), an American couple who worked for the KGB because of their communist beliefs. In 1954, Konon Molody settled in London, where he took courses at the London University School of Oriental and African Studies in Chinese. He was an outgoing character and had numerous female friends in London and Europe. Molody used a business as a cover, installing jukeboxes, bubble-gum and gambling machines, which were established using KGB funds. He travelled to Europe on business, where he may have recruited other agents and set up dead letter boxes. Once a year he would visit Prague or Warsaw to spend time with his Russian wife Galina. She was led to believe Konon was posted in China as a Soviet trade representative. In 1959, Molody began receiving British military secrets from Harry Houghton, who was working at the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment on the Isle of Portland. During his continental trips, Molody met the Krogers, whom he also often visited in London. He ran other spies, including Melita Norwood. The Krogers acted as his technical support; he communicated with Moscow via their hidden radio transmitter. UK conviction for espionage Lonsdale first came under suspicion from MI5 in 1959 after information was received from the CIA. The Treasury were required to give permission for the opening of a security box held in a branch of the Midland Bank in Great Portland Street. Concealed within a lighter was a London map for places to conceal or collect information. In London, on 7 January 1961, Metropolitan Police Special Branch officers, led by Detective Superintendent George Gordon Smith, arrested five people, all of whom were part of the Portland Spy Ring. One of the five was Gordon Lonsdale, who was caught by officers taking secrets from a British spy Harry Houghton on Waterloo Bridge. Taken to Scotland Yard, Lonsdale told Smith he would not disclose any information, including his real name or address. Western intelligence services, including MI5, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), had to resort to extensive enquiries to learn anything about him. All they could determine was that he was Russian, had a naval background, and was not the man his papers made him out to be. By the time he and his associates came to trial at the Old Bailey on 13 March 1961, the authorities still did not know his true identity. Lonsdale was put on trial in London charged with spying, along with associates Harry Houghton, Ethel Gee, and Morris and Lona Cohen (Peter and Helen Kroger). The defendants were all found guilty, with Lonsdale sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 1961. He was taken to Winson Green Prison, Birmingham, to start his sentence. Although he was in a single cell, he fraternised with some of the Great Train Robbers. In due course, the British and American security services managed to work out his true identity as being Konon Molody.

Issued with the approval of the Soviet authorities, he also claimed Peter and Helen Kroger, convicted as members of the Portland Ring, were innocent. Molody died during a mushroom- picking expedition in October 1970; he was 48. Retired KGB officer Leonid Kolosov, Konon's youth friend, who co-authored The Dead Season: End of the Legend, maintained that upon Konon's return from the UK, he was healthy, but shortly afterwards he began complaining that KGB doctors were giving him injections for supposed high blood pressure, whereafter Konon had headaches he never had before the injections but the doctors said he should expect to \\"feel worse before he felt better\\". He was buried in the Donskoy Cemetery in Moscow next to another spy, Vilyam Genrikovich Fisher (alias Rudolf Abel). A 1968 film Dead Season was based on the intelligence work of Molody.

It's a Holodeck show in the style of this science fiction franchise, this time in one of Quark's holosuite's on Deep Space Nine, and featuring the self-aware hologram Vic Fontaine played by James Darren. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, a surprise change programmed into Vic's (James Darren) lounge by the designer, Felix (a friend of Dr. Bashir), turns the lounge into a mob-owned casino and burlesque where Vic is no longer welcome. This has many guest stars filling in various holodeck characters that play opposite the main Deep Space Nine cast. Plot Julian Bashir and Miles O'Brien enjoy an evening at Vic Fontaine's, when the program suddenly changes into a noisy cabaret. Frankie Eyes, Vic's longtime rival, shows up to throw Vic out. Bashir and O'Brien try to delete Frankie or freeze the program, but it doesn't work. After Frankie fires Vic, the crew learns that Frankie was written into the holosuite program by Vic's designer, Felix. Upset by Frankie's treatment of Vic, and by the knowledge that the lounge's atmosphere will now change, the crew decides it must rid the program of Frankie. But to accomplish this task, they realize, he must be eliminated in a way that is period-specific to Fontaine's era: circa 1962. They cannot simply rewrite the program because that would result in Vic forgetting all the experiences that he has shared with the crew up to this point. The task takes on greater urgency when Vic is beaten up. Vic reveals that he was assaulted by Frankie's bodyguard, Tony Cicci. Eager to discover Frankie's weak spot, Odo and Kira go undercover in the casino to do some research. Frankie takes a liking to Kira, and while the two flirt, Odo learns that Frankie works for crime boss Carl Zeemo, who expects to receive from Frankie a large skim of the hotel's huge daily profits. The crew hatches a plan to rob the casino, hoping it will cause Zeemo to bump off Frankie in retaliation. The plot is set in motion when the crew infiltrates the casino staff, and Vic convinces Frankie to let him bring his high rolling contacts into the casino ‚Äî who, unbeknownst to Frankie, are Starfleet officers. Meanwhile, Benjamin Sisko resents Kasidy Yates' participation in the plan, admitting he has not visited Vic's because of how blacks were treated in Las Vegas in the 1960s. She urges him to reconsider, citing the comfort she and Jake have both felt in the lounge, and soon Sisko agrees to play a pivotal role as a big-money gambler. Vic walks the crew through their complex plan, to be executed the following night before Zeemo arrives. A security guard makes a phone call at the same time each night which allows them only eight minutes to pull off the heist. Though all crew members are well-prepared for their roles, the actual evening presents several glitches to the plan ‚Äî most notably when Nog discovers that the lock on the safe is of a different type than expected. While he struggles to crack the lock, Zeemo arrives a day early to pick up his cash. Noticing Zeemo's premature entrance, Vic does his best to stall him, while the other crew members fabricate enough stories and distractions to allow a successful Nog and Odo to slip away with the cash. After Zeemo discovers an empty safe, his thugs lead Frankie and Cicci out of the casino while reaching for the guns under their lapels ‚Äî leaving Vic to his cherished role as lounge singer and the crew to theirs as satisfied patrons. The atmosphere of the lounge changes back to the way it was originally. Vic takes the stage with his own band back, and calls up Captain Sisko, who joins him in a duet of \\"The Best Is Yet to Come\\". Cast note Actor Robert O'Reilly normally appears in the recurring role of Klingon Chancellor Gowron on the series. For this episode, he plays a holographic human working in the count room of the casino, and is credited as actor ‚ÄúBobby Reilly‚Äù in the opening guest appearances credits.

It shares a boundary to the North with Pilo√±a; to the East with Ponga; to the South with Le√≥n and to the West with Sobrescobio and Laviana. Most of the inhabitants of Caso live in the Nal√≥n Valley, on which the largest town is the capital El Campu. The town is divided in two neighbourhoods: L'Arrobiu and El Barru. The municipalities of Caso and Sobrescobio together constitute the Redes Natural Park, designated by the UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve. The Natural Monument of the Cueva Deboyu (the Nal√≥n River passes through a cave in the mountain) is also located in Caso. Caso is famous for its landscape, European beech forests, wood handcraft and its Cas√≠n cheese. In the past, most of Caso's people worked in coal mining and livestock farming. Nowadays, tourism has become one of the more important activities in Caso, but farming is still the most relevant. The Dam of Tanes provides electric energy and drinking water to the central part of Asturias. Access The town of Caleao The AS-17 (Avil√©s - Pass of Tarna) road is the easiest form to reach Caso from Oviedo or Gij√≥n. The AS-254 (El Campu - L'Infiestu) road connects Caso with Pilo√±a and the N-634 road. Caso and Le√≥n are connected by the Pass of Tarna. The nearest train station is located in Pola de Laviana.

He plays usually in the hole-position, and sometimes as a second striker. Club career Born in Asunci√≥n, Dos Santos started his professional career with Cerro Porte√±o, before eventually moving to FC Bayern Munich of Germany, in January 2006. He was elected Paraguayan Footballer of the Year in 2005 by national newspaper Diario ABC Color. Upon his arrival in Munich, he was touted as a long-term successor to Michael Ballack, but faced stiff competition from Iran's Ali Karimi. Eventually, both players struggled to break into the starting lineup. In the first half of 2006‚Äì07 Bundesliga season, Bayern's leadership publicly stated its impatience with Dos Santos' progress. Club coach Felix Magath said: \\"It is clear that Julio's development does not please us, It does not make sense to keep a player at the club who does not create\\". This led to widespread rumours of his departure from the club; the speculation ended in December 2006, when Bayern announced they had reached a deal to send the player on loan to fellow Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg for the remainder of the season. Having failed to break into Wolfsburg's first team (mainly due to a major injury), he returned to Bayern in June. At the conclusion of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Dos Santos had made four league appearances, as well as one appearance in the 2006‚Äì07 DFB-Pokal and two appearances in the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Champions League. However, after the arrivals of Franck Rib√©ry, Hamit Altƒ±ntop, Jos√© Sosa and Z√© Roberto, it soon became clear that he would again struggle to find a place in the first team. Ottmar Hitzfeld, who had replaced Magath as Bayern manager by that time, stated that the club sought to sell dos Santos. Therefore, he would split 2007‚Äì08 between UD Almer√≠a (with no first-team appearances) and Gr√™mio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense. In June 2008, dos Santos signed with Clube Atl√©tico Paranaense, also from Brazil. In June 2009, Julio went back to his original club Cerro Porte√±o to play the 2009 Clausura and Copa Sudamericana. On 29 December 2014, Julio dos Santos joined Brazilian club Vasco da Gama. Before signing with Sportivo Luque√±o, dos Santos rejected the opportunity to sign with Olimpia Asunci√≥n ‚Äì being Cerro Porte√±o's rival ‚Äì thanking however the club's president for interest in him but stating that his Cerro-ism would not permit him to join Olimpia. International career A Paraguayan international since 2004, dos Santos appeared for the nation at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in two matches, assisting for the first goal against Trinidad and Tobago (2‚Äì0). He played the 2007 Copa America but has not been called up for the World Cup Qualifiers.

It begins at U.S. Route 101 near Longvale, in Mendocino County, and ends at Brush Creek, in Butte County. For most of its length, it is a two lane, undivided highway. SR 162 is not signed as a contiguous route through Mendocino National Forest in Mendocino and Glenn counties. Instead, the portion inside the national forest is federally maintained by the U.S. Forest Service as Forest Highway 7 (FH 7), and is not included in the state route logs. Route description State Route 162 (SR 162) begins in Mendocino County at Longvale, south of the town of Laytonville along U.S. Route 101. It goes east through Long Valley next to the Middle Fork of the Eel River. On the opposite bank of the river is the right of way of the disused Northwestern Pacific Railroad. It is from Longvale to Covelo. This portion of SR 162 is called Covelo Road. Covelo is in Round Valley, home of the Round Valley Indian Reservation. SR 162 is called Covelo Road, Commercial Street, and/or Mina Road as it goes north through the center of town. Beyond Covelo, there are of paved road, called Mendocino Pass Road, between Covelo and the Mendocino National Forest; most of this portion of Mendocino Pass Road is primarily controlled by Mendocino County instead of under state maintenance. End of California Route 162 When entering the national forest the road becomes Forest Highway 7 (FH 7). FH 7 is maintained by the U.S. Forest Service as it continues across the Mendocino National Forest for approximately over Mendocino Pass (), which is closed in winter due to heavy snowfall. The highest point on the road () is just north of Black Butte and about NW of Copper City. It is roughly along the unpaved road to Alder Springs, which is inside the Mendocino National Forest in Glenn County. Alder Springs is the location of the Alder Springs GASB site, which is part of the Consolidated Reporting of Earthquakes and Tsunamis (CREST) network run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). State Route 162 resumes near Alder Springs and it is from there to Willows. Along the way, SR 162 crosses Stoney Creek and runs east paralleling Nye Creek. Seven miles west () of Willows is Thunderhill Raceway Park. At Willows, SR 162 passes the Willows-Glenn County Airport and crosses Interstate 5. From Willows and the intersection of Interstate 5, SR 162 runs east for to the town of Glenn. The track of SR 162 turns right and follows State Route 45 south for along the bank of the Sacramento River to Codora. The highway then turns left going east, crosses the Sacramento River and enters the town of Butte City. The highway jogs north as it passes through Butte City, then east again going due east to meet State Route 99 (formerly U.S. Route 99). This section is called the Butte City Highway. SR 162 turns north along SR 99 then east again as Oroville Dam Boulevard. State Route 70 onto SR 162 SR 162 turns right, (SE), onto Olive Highway as it leaves Oroville Travelling east, SR 162 passes the Thermalito Afterbay and the Oroville Municipal Airport, before crossing the Feather River on the Randy Jennings Memorial Bridge. As the highway enters Oroville, it crosses under State Route 70. This section is named Oroville Dam Blvd or \\"Oro-Dam\\". SR 162 goes through the center of Oroville then turns right onto Olive Highway. Olive Highway goes east to Kelly Ridge Road where it turns north and crosses Lake Oroville over the Bidwell Bar Bridge. SR 162 ends along the Oroville-Quincy Highway at Foreman Creek Road along the eastern edge of the Lake Oroville National Recreation Area. The junction of SR 162 and the Oroville-Quincy Highway near Lake Oroville SRA Headquarters The Oroville- Quincy Highway begins in Oroville at Oro-Dam Blvd E just past Olive Highway and runs east. It continues east roughly paralleling Olive Highway until it merges with SR 162 just before Oakvale Ave. It breaks off from SR 162 at Wally B Lane running parallel to the highway for a mile or so before reconnecting at Kelly Ridge Road. The highway runs roughly north and crosses Lake Oroville over the Bidwell Bar Bridge. SR 162 ends near here at Foreman Creek Road, but the Oroville-Quincy Highway continues toward Berry Creek and Madrone Lake. Here it turns east again and runs to Brush Creek. From Brush Creek, the highway turns north for to Palmetto. Here the highway turns ENE to Buck's Lodge and Bucks Lake. It then goes east along Bucks Lake Road past Meadow Valley and Spanish Ranch before arriving at Quincy, a total distance of . SR 162 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History In 1915, the Oroville-Quincy Highway was designated as Legislative Route Number 30. This route was abandoned by the state in 1924. In the late 1930s, there was a temporary routing of Alternate US 40 that ran from Davis through Yuba City to Oroville thence to Quincy along Oroville-Quincy Highway, and Bucks Lake Road. From 1965 to 1972, the segment from US 101 to Interstate 5 was defined as route 261. Major intersections Along California Route 162.

It consists of an inverting amplifier element such as a transistor or op amp with its output fed back to its input through a phase-shift network consisting of resistors and capacitors in a ladder network. The feedback network 'shifts' the phase of the amplifier output by 180 degrees at the oscillation frequency to give positive feedback.http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electronic/oscphas.html Phase-shift oscillators are often used at audio frequency as audio oscillators. The filter produces a phase shift that increases with frequency. It must have a maximum phase shift of more than 180 degrees at high frequencies so the phase shift at the desired oscillation frequency can be 180 degrees. The most common phase-shift network cascades three identical resistor-capacitor stages that produce a phase shift of zero at low frequencies and 270¬∞ at high frequencies. Implementations Circuit diagram for phase-shift oscillator using a BJT =Bipolar implementation= The implementation using NPN type bipolar transistor is based on example from popular electronics hobby magazine. The circuit generates a sinusoidal wave at its output. The RC phase-shift network is used to form a positive feedback loop. Resistor Rb provides base bias current. Resistor Rc is the collector load resistor for the collector current. Resistor Rs isolates the circuit from the external load. Circuit diagram for phase-shift oscillator using a JFET =FET implementation= The circuit implements the RC phase shift oscillator with FET. Note that the topology used for positive feedback is voltage series feedback. =Op-amp implementation= Circuit diagram for a phase-shift oscillator using an op-amp The implementation of the phase-shift oscillator shown in the diagram uses an operational amplifier (op-amp), three capacitors and four resistors. The circuit's modeling equations for the oscillation frequency and oscillation criterion are complicated because each RC stage loads the preceding ones. Assuming an ideal amplifier, the oscillation frequency is: :f_\\\\mathrm{oscillation}=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{R_2R_3(C_1C_2+C_1C_3+C_2C_3)+R_1R_3(C_1C_2+C_1C_3)+R_1R_2C_1C_2}} The feedback resistor required to just sustain oscillation is: :\\\\begin{align} R_\\\\mathrm{fb}= &2(R_1+R_2+R_3) + \\\\frac{2R_1R_3}{R_2} + \\\\frac{C_2R_2+C_2R_3+C_3R_3}{C_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\+ \\\\frac{2C_1R_1+C_1R_2+C_3R_3}{C_2} + \\\\frac{2C_1R_1+2C_2R_1+C_1R_2+C_2R_2+C_2R_3}{C_3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\+ \\\\frac{C_1R_1^2+C_3R_1R_3}{C_2R_2} + \\\\frac{C_2R_1R_3+C_1R_1^2}{C_3R_2} + \\\\frac{C_1R_1^2+C_1R_1R_2+C_2R_1R_2}{C_3R_3} \\\\end{align} The equations are simpler when all the resistors (except the negative feedback resistor) have the same value and all the capacitors have the same value. In the diagram, if and , then: :f_\\\\mathrm{oscillation}=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi RC\\\\sqrt{6}} and the oscillation criterion is: :R_\\\\mathrm{fb}=29 \\\\cdot R As with other feedback oscillators, when the power is applied to the circuit, thermal electrical noise in the circuit or the turn-on transient provides an initial signal to start oscillation. In practice, the feedback resistor must be a little bit larger so the oscillation will grow in amplitude rather than remain the same (small) amplitude. If the amplifier were ideal, then amplitude would increase without limit, but in practice amplifiers are nonlinear and their instantaneous gain varies. As the amplitude increases, amplifier saturation will decrease the amplifier's average gain. Consequently, the oscillation amplitude will keep increasing until the average loop gain of the circuit falls to unity; at that point, the amplitude will stabilize. When the oscillation frequency is high enough to be near the amplifier's cutoff frequency, the amplifier will contribute significant phase shift itself, which will add to the phase shift of the feedback network. Therefore the circuit will oscillate at a frequency at which the phase shift of the feedback filter is less than 180 degrees. The single op-amp circuit needs a relatively high gain (about 30) to maintain the oscillation due to the RC sections loading each other. If each RC segment did not affect the others, a gain of about 8 to 10 would be sufficient for oscillation. An isolated version of the oscillator can be made by inserting an op-amp buffer between each RC stage (this also simplifies the modeling equations).

Known as Old York Road, the state highway runs from MD 45 in Maryland Line east to MD 23 in Shawsville. In conjunction with MD 23 and Interstate 83 (I-83), MD 439 connects Bel Air with York, Pennsylvania. The state highway was constructed at both ends in the early 1930s. The middle section of MD 439 was brought into the state highway system around 1980. Route description View west from the east end of MD 439 at MD 23 in Shawsville MD 439 begins at an intersection with MD 45 (York Road) in Maryland Line a short distance south of the Pennsylvania state line. The state highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road through a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with I-83 (Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway). A park and ride lot is located at the southeast corner of this interchange. MD 439 heads southeast and passes through the hamlet of Shane as the highway follows the height of land between the drainage basins of Little Gunpowder Falls and Deer Creek. Shortly after crossing the Baltimore-Harford county line, the state highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 23 (Norrisville Road) in Shawsville. History Old York Road was an alternate, less-direct route for traffic between Towson and Maryland Lane compared to York Road. MD 439 is one of several extant stretches of the road; another segment is from south of Shawsville to MD 145 in Jacksonville, part of which is MD 562. MD 439 was paved as a state highway in two segments between 1930 and 1933: from York Road east to Lentz Road, and from the Baltimore-Harford county line east to MD 23. The state highway originally had an acute intersection with York Road north of the present terminal intersection. MD 439 was relocated when I-83 was completed from Parkton to the Pennsylvania state line in 1959. The state highway remained in pieces until the intervening section of Old York Road was brought under state maintenance around 1981.

The duo started working together in 1993 by founding Kaos Records, the first Portuguese electronic music label, with promoter Ant√≥nio Cunha. They released their first record as Underground Sound of Lisbon, Chapter One, in 1994, although at that time they also signed their production work as LHT (Lisbon Hard Team).

The strata of the Torridonian Group are particularly well exposed in the district of upper Loch Torridon, a circumstance which suggested the name Torridon Sandstone, first applied to these rocks by James Nicol. Stratigraphically, they lie unconformably on gneisses of the Lewisian complex and their outcrop extent is restricted to the Hebridean Terrane. Rock type The rocks are mainly red and brown sandstones, arkoses and shales with coarse conglomerates locally at the base. Some of the materials of these rocks were derived from the underlying Lewisian gneiss, upon the uneven surface of which they rest, but the bulk of the material was obtained from rocks that are nowhere now exposed. Upon this ancient denuded land surface the Torridonian strata rest horizontally or with gentle inclination. Some of the peaks, such as Beinn Eighe, are capped with white Cambrian quartzite, giving them a distinctive appearance when seen from afar. Some of the quartzite contains fossilized worm burrows and is known as pipe rock. It is circa 500 million years old. The Torridon landscape is itself highly denuded by glacial and alluvial action, and represents the remnants of an ancient peneplain. Occurrence Geological map of the Hebridean Terrane showing distribution of Torridonian sediments Thick-bedded sandstones of the Stoer Group exposed on the Old Man of Stoer Their outcrop extends in a belt of variable breadth from Cape Wrath to the Point of the peninsula of Sleat in Skye, running in a N.N.E.-S.S.W. direction through Caithness, Sutherland, Ross and Cromarty, and Skye and Lochalsh. They form the isolated mountain peaks of Canisp, Quinag and Suilven in the area of Loch Assynt, of Slioch near Loch Maree, and other hills. They attain their maximum development in the Applecross, Gairloch and Torridon districts, form the greater part of Scalpay, and occur also in R√πm, Raasay, Soay and the Crowlin Islands. They are also found beneath much of the Sea of the Hebrides overlying the Lewisian gneiss.C.Michael Hogan, (2011) Sea of the Hebrides. Eds. P. Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC. Sub-divisions The Torridonian is divided into the older Stoer Group and the younger Sleat and Torridon Groups separated by an angular unconformity. Paleomagnetic data suggest that this unconformity represents a major time break. These sediments are interpreted to have been deposited during a period of rifting. =Stoer Group= The Stoer Group outcrops on the peninsula of Stoer, near Assynt, Sutherland. It is subdivided into three formations. Clachtoll Formation A basal breccia is present in many areas with large clasts derived from the underlying Lewisian. There is local evidence of weathering of the gneiss beneath the unconformity. Away from the unconformity the breccia becomes crudely stratified within an overall fining upwards sequence passing up into pebbly sandstones, the deposits of small alluvial fans. This breccia facies passes vertically and laterally in most places into muddy massive sandstones, true greywackes. The lower part of these sandstones are almost unbedded being replaced upwards by half metre thick beds capped by siltstones often with well-preserved desiccation structures. In parts of the outcrop, the muddy sandstones are succeeded by the deposits of a braided river system, trough cross-bedded sandstones and conglomerates. Bay of Stoer Formation The Bay of Stoer Formation consists of a lower section formed of red trough cross-bedded sandstones with some pebbles, interpreted to be the deposits of a braided river system. The uppermost 100 m of the formation, the Stac Fada and Poll a' Mhuilt members, form a distinctive marker layer within the Stoer Group succession with a strike extent of 50 km. The Stac Fada Member is generally about 10 m thick and consists of muddy sandstone facies with abundant clasts of vesicular volcanic glass, locally with accretionary lapilli. The matrix for these volcanic clasts is always non-volcanic suggesting transport from the area where they were erupted. The member also includes large rafts of gneiss and sandstone, up to 15 m in length. The Stac Fada member has been traditionally interpreted to be a mudflow. An alternative suggestion has been that the member represents part of the proximal ejecta blanket from an impact crater. This interpretation is supported by the presence of shocked quartz and biotite. The overlying Poll a' Mhuilt member consists of a thin sequence of siltstones and fine sandstones alternating with muddy sandstones, suggesting deposition in a lacustrine environment. Meall Dearg Formation The uppermost part of the sequence consists of trough cross-bedded sandstones thought to have been deposited by braided rivers, similar to the lower part of the Bay of Stoer Formation, possibly with wider channels and a lower paleoslope. =Sleat Group= The Sleat Group, which outcrops on the Sleat peninsula on Skye, underlies the Torridon Group conformably, but the relationship with the Stoer Group is nowhere exposed. It is presumed to have been deposited later than the Stoer Group, but possibly in a separate sub-basin. It is metamorphosed to greenschist facies and sits within the Kishorn Nappe, part of the Caledonian thrust belt, making its exact relationship to the other outcrops difficult to assess. The sequence consists of mainly coarse feldspathic sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment with some less common grey shales, probably deposited in a lacustrine environment. Rubha Guail Formation The unconformity at the base of the Sleat Group is not exposed on Skye, but at Kyle of Lochalsh, the basal part of the sequence is seen to consist of breccias, with clasts derived from the underlying gneiss. Topographic relief on the unconformity reaches several hundred metres. Most of the remaining part of the formation consists of coarse green trough cross-bedded sandstones, the colour coming from its content of epidote and chlorite. The coarse sandstone beds are interbedded with fine- grained sandstones and siltstones, which become more common towards the top of the formation. The siltstones show desiccation features. The formation shows an overall upward-fining trend, which continued with the overlying Loch na Dal Formation siltstones. Loch na Dal Formation The basal part of this formation is formed of laminated dark-grey siltstones. This 200 m thick unit is often phosphatic and contains occasional coarse to very coarse sandstone laminae. It is interpreted to represent the maximum expansion of a lake. The upper part of the formation is composed mainly of coarse, occasionally pebbly, trough cross-bedded sandstones, interpreted to record the building out of a series of deltas into the earlier lake. Beinn na Seamraig Formation This formation consist of coarse-grained cross-bedded sandstones, typically showing contorted bedding. Kinloch Formation This formation is similar to the underlying Beinn na Seamraig Formation. The main difference is that the sandstones are generally finer-grained than those below and have better developed ripple-drift lamination. The sediments show marked cyclicity, with fining upward cycles, 25-35 m thick, with shales developed at the top. The uppermost boundary of this group with the overlying Torridon Group has been interpreted to be conformable, with evidence of interfingering between the Kinloch Formation shales and Applecross Formation sandstones. In support of this observation, there are no sandstone clasts above the boundary and no change in magnetisation between the formations. The main difference is in the degree of albitisation of the feldspars; those in the Sleat Group are only partially affected, while those in the Applecross Formation are completely albitised. There is also some evidence for a change in bedding orientation across the boundary, which is nowhere well-exposed, suggesting that it may represent some sort of disconformity. =Torridon Group= Horizontally bedded sandstones of the Torridon Group, forming the Horns of Beinn Alligin The Torridon Group infills an irregular land surface with up to 600 m of topography locally, cutting down through the previously deposited Stoer group sediments, resting in many areas directly on the Lewisian. It has been suggested that there is significant unconformity within this group, between the Diabaig and Applecross Formations. Diabaig Formation The lowest part of this formation consists of a basal breccia containing clasts derived from the underlying Lewisian complex with the thickest developments in the paleovalleys. The breccias passing vertically and laterally into tabular sandstones. These are locally channelised and interfinger with grey shales containing thin beds of fine-grained sandstone with wave rippled surfaces. The shales show the effects of desiccation with mudcracks preserved by being filled by overlying sandstone layers. In the upper part of the formation, beds of massive sandstone with sharp bases appear, becoming more common and thicker bedded towards the top. Ripple-drift lamination at the top of the sandstone layers indicates deposition from easterly-flowing currents. This sequence is interpreted to be to represent the progressive infill of the topography by alluvial fans building out into ephemeral lakes. The more massive beds are interpreted to be lake turbidites. Applecross Formation This formation consists of coarse sandstones, both trough and planar cross-bedded. The orientation of the troughs suggest a paleocurrent flowing from the Northwest. The sandstones carry a distinctive set of pebbles, including jasper and porphyry. Most of the sandstone beds are affected by soft-sediment deformation structures suggesting liquefaction, possibly as a result of seismic activity. The uppermost part of the formation consists of finer-grained sandstones, transitional to those of the overlying Aultbea Formation. At Cape Wrath the basal part of the formation shows a fanning of paleocurrent directions consistent with deposition from a large alluvial fan (~40 km radius) with its apex near the Minch Fault. The source area for this fan has been calculated as about 10,000 km2. Aultbea Formation Sgurr Fiona and the Corrag Bhuidhe pinnacles on An Teallach This formation is similar to the Applecross formation except that the sandstones are fine to medium-grained and there are very few pebbles. Almost all of these sandstone beds show the contortions shown by the older formation. The Applecross and Aultbea Formations together consist of an overall fining-upward sequence of sandstones. Only the outcrops at Cape Wrath described above have a consistent radial pattern suggesting that the sequence was deposited in a bajada environment, by a series of smaller fans merging to form a braided river system. Cailleach Head Formation This formation is similar to the underlying Aultbea Formation, the main difference being in grain size, with this formation being noticeably finer-grained. The sequence is made up of 22 m thick cycles, each with a basal erosion surface followed by dark grey shales with desiccation cracks, planar cross-bedded sandstones with wave rippled tops, overlain by trough cross-bedded micaceous sandstones. These cycles are thought to represent repeated progradation of deltas into a lake. A lack of evaporite minerals suggest that the lakes had through drainage. Acritarch microfossils were described from here by Teall in 1907, the first Precambrian fossils described in Britain. Age The upper age limit for the deposition of this sequence is constrained by the age of the last tectonic and metamorphic event to affect the Lewisian complex on which it was deposited, for which ages cluster between about 1200-1100 Ma. The lower limit is provided by the age of the lower Cambrian quartzite that lies above it, about 544 Ma. Radiometric ages from the Torridonian sequence itself give ages of about 1200 Ma for the Stoer Group and 1000-950 for the basal part of the Torridon Group. This implies an age gap of at least 200 Ma between the deposition of these two groups, consistent with the paleomagnetic evidence. Ages of detrital zircons also provide some constraints on the sequence age. The Stoer group and the lower part of the Sleat Group show ages consistent with derivation from Scourian and to a lesser extent Laxfordian rocks, with no dates after 1700 Ma. The upper part of the Sleat Group includes a large component of broadly Laxfordian age with almost no Archaean ages, with a lower limit of about 1200 Ma. In contrast the Diabaig Formation shows a small group clustered around 1100 Ma, the age of the Grenville Orogeny. In the Applecross and Aultbea Formations there are many more zircons giving ages around 1100 Ma and even below 1000 Ma. This evidence suggest that the Stour and Sleat Groups were deposited before the Grenvillian event, pre-1200 Ma, while the Diabaig Formation was deposited after the orogeny, after about 1090 Ma, and the remaining parts of the Torridon Group after about 1060 Ma. A more precise age has been obtained for authigenic feldspars in the Stac Fada Member of the Stoer Group at 1177¬±5 Ma interpreted to have formed immediately after emplacement of the ejecta blanket. Tectonic setting Variations in thickness and lithology are consistent with both the Stoer and Sleat/Torridon Groups being deposited in a rift setting. Evidence from seismic reflection data in the Minch suggests that the Minch Fault was active throughout the deposition of the Torridon Group. This is consistent with the generally westerly derived pebbly material throughout the thickness of the Applecross Formation, suggesting a constantly rejuvenated sediment source in that direction. More recent work has suggested that although the Stoer and Sleat Groups were probably deposited in a rift setting, the scale and continuity of the Torridon Group, particularly the Applecross and Aultbea Formations, is more consistent with a molasse type setting possibly related to the Grenvillian Orogeny.

The X-rated silent short, which is no more than 20 minutes in length and was filmed in black-and- white, was one of the most famous and widely circulated of the early underground pornographic era. It has been called \\"iconographic\\", \\"the best known of all American stag films\\", and the \\"apogee of the American stag tradition\\". The leading actress, then known as Juanita Slusher, a buxom young woman of age 16 who appeared substantially older, later went on to fame as the stripper Candy Barr. Barr was working as a prostitute at the time, and was forced to feature in the film by one of her clients. At the time there was a rumour that the man was Gary Crosby, son of Bing Crosby. It was shot in a Dallas hotel, which was the setting for several other pornographic shorts of the period. Other sources, such as the Internet Movie Database, report that the stag film was shot in San Antonio and the young Juanita was inveigled into appearing in it by a patron of a Dallas strip club where she worked as a cigarette girl and had sex with generous tippers. Barr herself told a men's magazine that she made the stag film because she was broke and hungry. ‚ÄúI went to the address a friend gave me. The man behind the desk looked me over. He told me I had a great figure. Then he explained he wanted me to act in a risqu√© film. Then he opened his wallet and counted a bunch of ten-dollar bills. He counted them out on the desk before me, one by one. The purse I clutched in my hands contained exactly seven cents. I made the film.\\" The film led to Barr being called \\"the first porn star\\". With Barr's cooperation the FBI subsequently prosecuted the producer for exploitation of a minor. Barr later sued Playboy magazine when it printed a still from the film. Luke Ford, the gossip columnist who wrote A History of X: 100 Years of Sex in Film, said of the stag film \\"It ruined her life. She regretted it all her days.\\" ‚ÄúOnly when my hunger was gone could I think straight. But I was still too young to understand fully just what I had done,\\" Barr told the men's magazine. \\"I‚Äôm still sick with shame over what I did, but when you‚Äôre (young) and all alone and your insides are crying for food, you can‚Äôt always figure out right from wrong.‚Äù The film is included in many compilations of historic pornographic films. Smart Alec was among the films featured in Alex De Renzy's A History of the Blue Movie in 1970. It was later made available on video under the title Smokers of the Past, Vol. 1. Synopsis A traveling salesman meets a beautiful young girl (Barr) by a motel swimming pool and picks her up. They go to his room for drinks and a good time. They have sexual intercourse. He performs cunnilingus on her, but when he wants her to perform fellatio she refuses. When the salesman attempts to force her to perform the sex act against her will, she fights back. He jumps off the bed and sulks. She gets off the bed to comfort him, then calls a girlfriend and asks her to come over to join them. The other young woman arrives at the motel room, and accommodates the man in the manner he requested. When he positions the girlfriend in the 69 position to perform cunnilingus on her while she continues to fellate him. His original lover joins them and straddles his face. She then performs sexual intercourse by riding him topside.

It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Harley Street of the North\\". Together with Hope Street and Gambier Terrace it forms the Rodney Street conservation area. There are over 60 Grade II listed buildings on the street and one Grade II* former church. History Rodney Street, Liverpool circa 1885 Rodney Street was laid out in 1783-1784 by William Roscoe and others. It was named after George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney, who, in 1782, secured a naval victory over the Comte de Grasse at the Battle of the Saintes. It was developed piecemeal up to the 1820s with houses for the affluent, escaping the old town centre. A few houses have five bays, with central doors, but most are three bays. They were erected in pairs or short runs by different developers which led to an inconsistent roof line. Sometimes referred to in local media as the \\"Harley Street of the North\\", some buildings on Rodney Street are now used by doctors conducting private clinics, notably for cosmetic surgery. =Buildings= E. Chambr√© Hardman's studio at 59 Rodney Street No. 9 was the birthplace of Arthur Clough, a poet born in 1819. No. 62 (built 1792-1793) was the birthplace in 1809 of William Ewart Gladstone, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on four separate occasions through the 1860s to the 1890s, and the home of his father John. No. 59 Rodney Street was home and studio to Edward Chambr√© Hardman (1898-1988), photographer, and is now owned by the National Trust and is open to the public. On the north side of Rodney Street stands the disused Scottish Presbyterian Church of Saint Andrew, built in 1823-1824\\\\. The body of the church is of a simple two-storey design with round arched windows and stuccoed walls designed by Daniel Stewart. The fa√ßade of blackened ashlar, designed by John Foster Jr., is an imposing composition of Ionic entrance columns, flanked by corner towers, topped with Corinthian columns and domes. In 2012, the former church was renovated and redeveloped to provide en suite student accommodation for 100 students.

He was also one of the first Muslims to be elected to higher office in North America. He held a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1975 to 1989 sitting with the governing Progressive Conservative Caucus. During his time in office he served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Premier Peter Lougheed and Don Getty occupying various portfolios from 1979 to 1989. Early life Lawrence Ralph Shaben was born on March 20, 1935 in Hanna, Alberta The family moved to Edmonton in the mid-1940s after North America's first mosque was opened there. Shaben went to Eastwood High School before going on to the University of Alberta. He left university early to join the workforce. Shaben married Alma Saddy in 1960 and they had five children by 1966. He moved his family to High Prairie and bought a general store. Political career Shaben got his first start in politics by serving on the municipal council for the town of High Prairie. He moved his career to the provincial level when he ran for a seat in the Alberta Legislature in the 1975 Alberta general election. He ran in the electoral district of Lesser Slave Lake as a candidate for the Progressive Conservative party. He won the electoral district defeating incumbent Dennis Barton and a third candidate by a wide margin to pick up the seat for his party. With his win Shaben was the first Arab elected in Alberta and among the first Muslims elected to higher political office in North America. Shaben ran for a second term in office in the 1979 Alberta general election. He faced a tougher race, losing a little bit of his popular vote from the previous election against three other candidates including future MLA Dan Backs. Shaben held his district and was returned to the Legislature. After the election Premier Peter Lougheed appointed Shaben to the Executive Council of Alberta. He became Minister of Utilities and Telephones. His appointment would make him the first Muslim cabinet minister in Canada. He would run for a third term in office in the 1982 general election with ministerial advantage. Shaben would easily hold his district defeating the four other candidates with a much larger popular vote and margin of victory. Lougheed shuffled his cabinet after the election. Shaben became the Minister of Housing. In 1984, Shaben survived a plane crash near High Prairie, Alberta that killed fellow MLA and Alberta NDP leader Grant Notley and five other passengers. He held that portfolio after Don Getty became Premier in 1985. Shaben would run a fourth term in office in the 1986 general election. He would face a hotly contested fight against New Democrat candidate Bert Dube. Despite his popular vote dropping Shaben was able to hang onto his seat. Getty made his first cabinet shuffle after the election and appointed Shaben to his final portfolio as Minister of Economic Development and Trade. He held that portfolio until he retired at dissolution of the Assembly in 1989. Late life Shaben was severely beaten by a hitch-hiker and wound up hospitalized in 1986. Following 9/11 Shaben became active in promoting greater tolerance and understanding of Muslims in Canada. He was later instrumental in establishing the Edmonton Islamic Academy and a Chair In Islamic Studies at the University of Alberta. In 2005 he was appointed a federal citizenship judge. Shaben died on September 6, 2008 following a long bout with cancer. His funeral was attended by more than 1,000 people and numerous politicians including three provincial Premiers.

Additionally, the animation was produced by Rick Reinert Productions, which went uncredited. It would be the first Disney animated film since the 1938 Silly Symphonies short Merbabies to be produced by an outside studio. The company had also previously produced the educational Disney short Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons in 1981. Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore was the fourth and final animated featurette in the Winnie the Pooh film series and one of Disney's original theatrical featurettes adapted from the Pooh books by A.A. Milne. Plot The film begins with the invention of a racing game called Poohsticks in which Pooh takes a walk to a wooden bridge over a river where he likes to do nothing in particular. On this day, though, he finds a fir cone and picks it up. Pooh thinks up a rhyme to go with the fir cone, but he accidentally trips on a tree root and drops it in the river. Noticing that the flow of the river takes the cone under the bridge, Pooh invents a racing game out of it. As the game uses sticks instead of cones, he calls it \\"Poohsticks\\". Later that day Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit and Roo are playing Poohsticks, then see Eeyore floating in the river. After somehow rescuing him with a rock, he tells them that he fell in due to being bounced from behind. Piglet assumes it was Tigger who bounced Eeyore into the river. When Tigger arrives on the scene, he claims that his bounce was actually a cough, leading to an argument between him and Eeyore, but with some outside help from the narrator, Winnie the Pooh and his friends find out that he had indeed deliberately bounced Eeyore on page 245. Tigger says it was all a joke, but nobody else feels that way. Tigger disgustedly says that they have no sense of humor, and bounces away. But as Eeyore seems particularly depressed this day, Pooh follows him to his Gloomy Spot and asks what the problem is. Eeyore says that it is his birthday, and nobody has taken any notice to celebrate it. Pooh decides to give him a jar of honey, but does not get far before he has a hunger attack and ends up eating the honey. He decides to ask Owl for advice. Owl suggests that he writes to Eeyore on the pot so that Eeyore could use it to put things in. Owl ends up writing a misspelled greeting (hipy papy bthuthdth thuthda bthuthdy means A Very Happy Birthday, With Love from Pooh) on the pot and flies off to tell Christopher Robin about the birthday. Piglet, who heard about Eeyore's birthday from Pooh, planned to give a red balloon to Eeyore, but when Owl greets him from the sky, Piglet forgets to look where he is going, until he hits a tree and causes it to accidentally burst the balloon. Piglet is very sad that his gift for Eeyore is spoiled, but he presents it to him anyway, and only a minute later, Pooh brings the empty pot. Eeyore is gladdened, as he puts the busted balloon into the pot and removes it again (he also claimed that he likes the color red). Pooh and his friends then pitch in and plan a surprise party for their friend. During the party, Tigger arrives and bounces Rabbit out of his chair. Roo welcomes him to the festivities as Rabbit draws himself up from being bounced on by Tigger, incensed. Rabbit opines that Tigger should leave because of the way he treated Eeyore earlier, Roo wants Tigger to stay, and Christopher Robin's solution is for everyone to go to the bridge and play Poohsticks. Eeyore, a first-time player, wins the most games, but Tigger wins nothing at all, causing him to conclude that \\"Tiggers don't like Poohsticks\\". Eeyore's secret for winning, as he explains to Tigger afterwards, is to \\"let his stick drop in a twitchy sort of way.\\" As Tigger bounces Eeyore again, Christopher Robin, Pooh and finally Piglet all decide that \\"Tigger's all right, really\\". Voice cast * Ralph Wright as Eeyore * Hal Smith as Winnie the Pooh and Owl * Laurie Main as the Narrator * Will Ryan as Rabbit * Dick Billingsley as Roo * John Fiedler as Piglet * Kim Christianson as Christopher Robin * Julie McWhirter Dees as Kanga * Paul Winchell as Tigger Only Hal Smith, Ralph Wright, John Fiedler, and Paul Winchell returned in the roles they had originated. Kim Christianson became the fourth different actor to portray Christopher Robin in as many featurettes, after Bruce Reitherman, Jon Walmsley, and Timothy Turner. Dick Billingsley assumed the role of Roo after Dori Whitaker and Clint Howard portrayed him in the previous featurettes. Home media The first home video release for Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore was Winnie the Pooh and Friends, released on VHS in 1984, followed by other releases of this film, including the December 28, 1990 Walt Disney Mini- Classics release and the July 11, 2000 Storybook Classics release. It has since been included as a bonus feature on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray releases of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, with the Blu-ray edition presenting the short in high definition. However, on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, the short carries different voice credits than those on previous video releases. Jim Cummings (Pooh & Tigger), Ken Sansom (Rabbit), Tress MacNeille (Kanga), Trevyn Savage (Christopher Robin), Steve Schatzberg (Piglet), Andre Stojka (Owl), Peter Cullen (Eeyore), and Aaron Spann (Roo) are listed, despite that the original soundtrack appears unaltered. This implies that a re-dub was attempted with these actors, but ultimately was not used.

The IVA was established by and is governed by Part VIII of the Insolvency Act 1986 and constitutes a formal repayment proposal presented to a debtor's creditors via an insolvency practitioner. Usually (but not necessarily), the IVA comprises only the claims of unsecured creditors, leaving the rights of secured creditors largely unchanged. Insolvency practitioners charge initial and ongoing fees that are in addition to the debt. An IVA is a contractual arrangement with creditors and can be as flexible as an individual's own circumstances; they can therefore be based on capital, income, third party payments or a combination of these. In this process, a debtor who has enough money left over after priority creditors and essential expenses, may be able to arrange an individual voluntary arrangement.Options for paying off your debts HM Government. (After taking independent advice, debtors with less serious problems may wish to consider a debt management plan.) The analogous procedure for businesses is the company voluntary arrangement. Process Creditors take a decision at a creditors' meeting called to consider the IVA proposal. The return to creditors is often higher than they would receive in bankruptcy. A vote is taken ‚Äì by value. 75% in value of those creditors who vote at the meeting by person or by proxy must agree in order for the arrangement to be approved. If any of those voting are 'associates' (usually business associates, friends and family) then a second count is taken and 50% of non-associated creditors must approve it. IVAs were originally designed to provide relief to debts generated as a result of business insolvency. Since the late 1990s increasing levels of consumer debt have led to many insolvent individuals with non-business-generated debts seeking the legal protection offered within an IVA. IVAs may be popular with people who have assets which they wish to protect. These assets, such as high-equity properties and expensive cars etc., are not directly at risk under an IVA ‚Äì as they may be in a bankruptcy.The Insolvency Service. \\"d. Individual voluntary arrangements\\" Retrieved on 2010-04-11.  Advantages and disadvantages  The advantages and disadvantages of an IVA compared with other debt solutions are particular to a debtor's individual circumstances and professional advice should be sought to decide on the best option. =Stigma= An IVA is a private agreement between a debtor and creditors. As of 6 April 2009, bankruptcy is no longer advertised in the local newspaper, only in the London Gazette. IVA is not advertised. Both debtors in an IVA and bankruptcy are listed publicly on the Personal Insolvency Register - anyone can view the Insolvency Register but it usually mainly used by credit reference agencies who use it to update credit records (an IVA will affect your credit record but this is the same as with other debt solutions), and creditors who will use the Insolvency Register to help them make a decision on whether they should lend money to potential customers. It is unlikely neighbours will check the Register, which can be a worry people assume when they find out they are going to be listed on a public register. =Length= An income-based IVA can often last up to five years, although it can be any length. Homeowners may find their income based IVA term can be extended by 12 months in lieu of equity, if they own equity in a property which cannot be released into the IVA for the benefit of their creditors. A bankrupt is normally automatically discharged after one year or less if the bankrupt is eligible for an early discharge. An income payments agreement or order in bankruptcy (if one is applied, depending on the individuals disposable income) will not last for more than three years and payments are generally much lower than under an income based IVA. =Obtaining credit= Unlike bankruptcy, an IVA does not statutorily restrict a debtor from obtaining credit, although the proposal may do so. In bankruptcy however one legally can obtain credit of up to ¬£500 without disclosing one's status as a bankrupt. After a bankrupt is discharged there is nothing in law to stop the discharged bankrupt gaining credit. =Ability to trade= Bankruptcy will usually dissolve a partnership and prevent a debtor from acting as a director of a company. A self-employed trader will have to disclose the fact that he or she is bankrupt when obtaining credit, for example when dealing with suppliers. There are no such implications with an IVA, although lenders often ask. =Credit rating= Although arguably an IVA is seen as more positive than bankruptcy in the eyes of creditors, as it shows a certain commitment to repaying debt, in reality an IVA is likely to have an equally detrimental effect on a debtor's credit rating as bankruptcy. Usually a debtor's credit rating is already poor before an IVA or bankruptcy is considered however. Both bankruptcy and an IVA will stay on a debtor's credit file for six years from the start of the IVA or bankruptcy. =Fees and Disbursements = There are two separate fees payable in an IVA. Both of these fees are paid as part of the Arrangement and are included in the monthly contributions made to the IVA. These fees do not generally affect the total amount payable, but instead reduce the final dividend that each creditor hopes to receive from the IVA. As a result, an Insolvency Practitioner must agree his fees with voting creditors before an IVA is accepted. The nominee's fee is a fee charged in relation to the work performed up to the point when the IVA is agreed. It is reclaimed from payments into the IVA before any dividend is paid to creditors. The supervisor's fee is an ongoing fee in relation to the work performed during an IVA. It is reclaimed from payments into the IVA at regular intervals, as agreed with voting creditors. This could be quarterly or annually depending on the rules stipulated in the individual's proposal. Some debt management companies try to include an extra IVA arrangement fee. An IVA will also charge disbursements throughout the duration of the IVA, to cover any costs incurred by the supervisor managing the arrangement. Disbursements are split into category 1 and category 2 disbursements. Category 1 disbursements are costs directly related to arrangement and payments made to any third parties. Examples of these disbursements are bonds, PPI and mis-selling searches and set-up fees. Category 1 disbursements cannot be capped by creditors. Category 2 disbursements are related to the insolvency arrangement, however are not made to a third party. They include shared or allocated costs on a reasonable basis. Examples of this are business mileage, printing and photocopying and postage =The home= Perhaps the biggest advantage to an IVA over bankruptcy is the control the debtor may have over their home. In bankruptcy, the debtor's assets will vest in the Trustee (some assets are excluded, notably those used as tools of trade, ordinary household contents). This will usually include equity in their property and the trustee may force its sale. An IVA proposal may exclude the property altogether, or propose a re-mortgage or offer income based contributions for a longer period in lieu of the debtor's equitable interest in the property. The supervisor may register a restriction on the property to ensure that his or her consent is required before the property is, for example, sold or re-mortgaged. =Failure= If an IVA fails because an individual can not keep up with the repayments (or agree new terms with the trustee and creditors), then bankruptcy becomes a real possibility. Because a significant proportion of IVA repayments go towards payment of the nominee's and supervisor's fees, people who have failed an IVA often find they had not paid as much of the debt off as they had expected. Additionally, creditors will also add on interest and charges to the debts from the meeting of creditors date to the date of failure (currently 8% per annum), thereby increasing the level of debt. Roles of the insolvency practitioner An IVA can only be administered by a licensed insolvency practitioner. At each stage of the IVA process, the insolvency practitioner's role changes. =Adviser= The adviser does not have to be an insolvency practitioner, though often is. The adviser should inform the debtor of all the solutions available, commonly including dealing with priority debts first, re-mortgage, consolidating debts into a loan, debt management, bankruptcy, a Debt Relief Order, and IVA. The adviser should look at all the debtor's circumstances, what they own, what they owe, and their household income & expenditure to advise the best solution. The adviser may charge for debt advice, however most IVA providers will offer advice without any upfront cost. Charitable debt advice agencies include Citizens Advice Bureau, StepChange Debt Charity, and Christians Against Poverty who may suggest debt management measures that do not involve an IVA. =Nominee= If an IVA is considered appropriate, the insolvency practitioner will become the nominee. There is a misapprehension that it is the nominee's role to advise the debtor on drafting a proposal to the creditors. This is not the case. The legislation is clear that this is the task of the debtor and his or her advisers, which nevertheless may be the nominee's firm. It is instead the nominee's task to review the proposal on which he has been asked to act, and to report on it. In practice, the proposal is generally a standard document which is modified to the each debtor's particular circumstance. Common terms will include: An analysis of the debtor's income (A) and expenditure (B). From this, the debtor's disposable income is calculated (A)‚àí(B) and this will become the amount that will be paid into the IVA periodically (usually monthly). The period is usually five years, but can be any length. The proposal will usually state that if the disposable income increases during the term of the IVA, the amount to be paid will also increase proportionately. A background history explaining how the debtor's financial difficulties arose. Details of any assets that are to be realised or excluded. For example, how the matrimonial home will be dealt with, pension schemes, share save schemes, vehicles, etc. The ability to call future meetings of creditors in the event that circumstances change, to modify the terms of the IVA. Restrictions on obtaining credit. This is because a debt incurred after the approval of the IVA could result in a bankruptcy petition from a creditor, which would almost certainly cause the IVA to fail. =Chairman= The Chairman will hold the meeting of creditors and negotiate with the debtor and creditors to approve the proposal. It is common for creditors to ask for modifications to the proposal at the meeting. Common modifications put forward by major banks include restricting the debtor from obtaining credit, ensuring payments increase if the debtor's income increases, specifying a minimum return such as 40 pence in the pound, and insisting that the supervisor fails the IVA if the debtor misses 3 or more payments, and petitions for the debtor's bankruptcy. =Supervisor= If the IVA is approved, the insolvency practitioner named as supervisor in the approved IVA becomes the Supervisor of the IVA. This involves reporting annually to the creditors, debtor and the court. It also involves monitoring that the debtor is complying with the terms of the arrangement, agreeing creditor claims, making payments to creditors and generally ensuring that the arrangement progresses in accordance with the terms of the proposal. The debtor must comply with all reasonable requests of the supervisor, which may include periodically providing bank statements, accounts, wage slips etc. See also * Administrations * Administrative receiverships * Bankruptcy * Citizens Advice Bureau * Company voluntary arrangement ‚Äì the equivalent for companies * Liquidations * Personal Insolvency Arrangement ‚Äì a statutory mechanism in Ireland * Trust deeds ‚Äì only available in Scotland * Simplified individual voluntary arrangement * Sole trader insolvency Notes External links * Insolvency Service website * Debt and money - Citizens Advice Category:Bankruptcy in England and Wales ","title":"Individual voluntary arrangement"},{"id":"3619432","text":"Red Rock Township may refer to:  Canada  * Red Rock, Ontario  United States  * Red Rock Township, Marion County, Iowa, in Marion County, Iowa * Red Rock Township, Mower County, Minnesota * Red Rock Township, Minnehaha County, South Dakota, in Minnehaha County, South Dakota Category:Township name disambiguation pages ","title":"Red Rock Township"},{"id":"3619434","text":"The Carolina Ghostriders were an indoor football team and charter member of the American Indoor Football League.

He got a B. A. degree from Cornell University in 1926, was an instructor in history at Syracuse University from 1926 to 1928, and then studied in the graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania from 1929 to 1931, teaching undergraduate classes, as well as teaching at Bryn Mawr Summer School for Workers (1930‚Äì31). After graduating, Biemiller became active in the Socialist Party of America and was a campaign manager for Norman Thomas, Socialist candidate for president in 1932. In 1933, he went to Milwaukee to work for the party, serving as educational director of the party from 1933 to 1936, editing the Milwaukee Leader (a Socialist newspaper) from 1934 to 1936, and working with various organizations. He became an active member of the Farmer-Labor Progressive Federation as well as the Socialist Party. Biemiller was a member of the American Federation of Teachers, and the American Newspaper Guild, served on the executive board of the Milwaukee Federated Trades Council and was vice-president of the Wisconsin Turner District.  Public office  = Assembly = In 1936 he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly on the ticket of the Wisconsin Progressive Party (the Socialists and Progressives were practicing a form of electoral fusion during this period; but his biography clearly identified him as an active Socialist) from the 2nd Milwaukee County district (the 2nd and 10th Wards of the City of Milwaukee), unseating Democratic incumbent Clarence Kretlow, with 6,767 votes to 5867 for Kretlow and 2129 for Republican Alex Klose. He was appointed to the standing committees on the judiciary and public welfare, to a special joint committee on \\"Legislation on Administration of State Government\\", and perhaps most importantly to the \\"Interim Committee\\" appointed in 1937 by the Legislature to discuss reorganization of Wisconsin government.

He was moved to the committee on engrossed bills and to an additional special committee on \\"Subversive and Un-American Activities of Certain Groups of Employes Engaged in the Manufacture of National Defense Materials\\". His official biography no longer listed him as an active member of the Socialist Party, but did describe him as a member of the Progressive Party Federation; and he became the floor leader of the Progressive Party in the Assembly.Ohm, Howard F.; Bryhan, Leone G., eds.

He did not run for re-election, and was succeeded in the Assembly by Democrat Michael F. O'Connell. = Congress = In 1944 he was elected as a Democrat (Biemiller had abandoned both the Socialist Party and the Progressives by then) to the 79th Congress from the Milwaukee-based Wisconsin's 5th congressional district, unseating Republican incumbent Lewis D.

During this period Biemiller joined many other former Socialists and Progressives in helping to found Americans for Democratic Action. He cooperated with Hubert Humphrey in successfully calling for a strong civil rights plank at the 1948 Democratic National Convention, to which he was a delegate and chair of the platform committee which produced the plank. He defeated Kersten in a 1948 re-match for election to the 81st Congress, but once more lost a bid for re-election in 1950 to Kersten.  After Congress  After losing his seat in Congress, Biemiller worked through the remainder of the Truman administration at the Department of the Interior. He served from 1953-1956 as a legislative representative (lobbyist) for the American Federation of Labor, and then Director of the Department of Legislation (chief lobbyist) of the AFL-CIO from 1956‚Äì1978. During this period he played a significant role in passing civil rights, Medicare, and other social and economic legislation, especially during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

Regarded as the \\"black sheep\\" of the family, he was dubbed \\"the dancing marquess\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/actors/bought-diamonds- ordinary-man-buys-cigarettes-story-britains/ and for his Butterfly Dancing, taken from Loie Fuller, where a voluminous robe of transparent white silk would be waved like wings.Shopland, Norena 'The Butterfly Dancer' from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales Seren Books (2017) Vicary Gibbs, writing in The Complete Peerage in 1910, commented that he \\"seems only to have existed for the purpose of giving a melancholy and unneeded illustration of the truth that a man with the finest prospects, may, by the wildest folly and extravagance, as Sir Thomas Browne says, 'foully miscarry in the advantage of humanity, play away an uniterable life, and have lived in vain.'\\"Cokayne and Gibbs 1910, p. 141n. Family background Paget was the eldest son of the 4th Marquess by his father's second wife, Blanche Mary Boyd. However, rumours persisted that his biological father was the French actor Beno√Æt-Constant Coquelin, a rumour that gained some currency when, according to some sources, after the death of his mother in 1877, when he was two years old, Paget reportedly was raised by Coquelin's sister-in-law in Paris until he was eight. That story seems to have been a confusion of facts. The sister-in-law, n√©e Edith Marion Boyd, was the fourth marquess's aunt, one of his mother's sisters, and she did not wed Coquelin's brother Gustave until 1891. His stepmother from 1880 was an American, Mary \\"Minna\\" Livingston King, the widow of the Hon. Henry Wodehouse. He attended Eton College, later receiving private tuition, and was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. On 20 January 1898 he married his cousin Lilian Florence Maud Chetwynd (1876‚Äì1962). Upon the death of his father on 13 October 1898, he inherited his title and the family estates with about 30,000 acres (120 km¬≤) in Staffordshire, Dorset, Anglesey and Derbyshire, providing an annual income of ¬£110,000 (equivalent to ¬£ per year in ). Lifestyle Plas Newydd, Paget's country house on Anglesey Interior of Paget's Gaiety Theatre at Plas Newydd Henry Paget in theatrical costume, c.1900 Paget swiftly acquired a reputation for a lavish and spendthrift manner of living. He used his money to buy jewellery and furs, and to throw extravagant parties and flamboyant theatrical performances. He renamed the family's country seat Plas Newydd as \\"Anglesey Castle\\" and converted the chapel there into a 150-seat theatre, named the Gaiety Theatre. Here he took the lead role, opulently costumed, in productions ranging from pantomime and comedy to performances of Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband and Shakespeare's Henry V. Early performances from around 1899 were mostly variety performances of song and dance numbers, sketches and tableaux vivants in front of an invited audience of notable local people. In 1901, the Gaiety Theatre was refurbished and fitted out with electric stage lighting and re-opened as a public entertainment venue. For three years Paget took his theatre company on tour around Britain and Europe. His wife disapproved of his lifestyle and obtained a decree nisi of divorce on 7 November 1900; the marriage was later annulled due to nonconsummation, according to Lady Anglesey's grandson by her second marriage, the historian Christopher Simon Sykes. The breakdown of his marriage effectively gave Paget more freedom to enjoy his self-indulgent lifestyle. By this stage he had already begun to mortgage his estates to raise money. =Theft= On 10 September 1901, Paget attended the London premiere of Arthur Conan Doyle's stage adaptation of Sherlock Holmes at the Lyceum Theatre, London. At the time, Paget was living in the Walsingham House Hotel in London. Paget's French valet Julian Gault took the opportunity of his employer's absence at the theatre to steal jewellery to the value of ¬£50,000. Distraught at the theft, Paget enlisted the help of Conan Doyle to find the stolen jewels. Gault, who was later arrested at Dover, testified in court that he had been instructed to steal the jewels by a French woman of his acquaintance called Mathilde (who had taken the jewels to France and was never found). Although Gault's testimony was believed to be true, he pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey on 22 October and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Sexuality Paget's outrageous and flamboyant lifestyle, his taste for cross-dressing, and the breakdown of his marriage, have led many to assume that he was gay. Writing in 1970, the homosexual reformer H. Montgomery Hyde characterised him as \\"[t]he most notorious aristocratic homosexual at this period\\". One journalist wrote, ‚ÄúI am driven to the conclusion from much that I have seen that there are men who ought to have been born women, and women who ought to have been born men ‚Ä¶ Bearing the form of a man, he yet had all the tastes, something even of the appearance, of not only a woman, but, if the phrase be permissible, a very effeminate woman.‚Äù Shopland, 2017 Norena Shopland wrote that \\"there is little doubt that Henry must be included in the history of gender identity.\\"Shopland, 2017. There is no evidence for or against his having had any lovers of either sex: performance historian Viv Gardner believes rather that he was \\"a classic narcissist: the only person he could love and make love to was himself, because, for whatever reason, he was 'unlovable'\\". The deliberate destruction by his family of those of his papers that might have settled this matter has left any assessment speculative. However, according to Christopher Sykes, he did not have sexual relations with his wife, who initially left him after just six weeks. Sykes has reported: \\"The closest the marriage ever came to consummation was that he would make her pose naked covered top to bottom in jewels and she had to sleep wearing the jewels.\\"Christopher Sykes, grandson of Lilian Florence Maud Chetwynd, The Aristocracy: Born to Rule 1875‚Äì1945, BBC, first broadcast 29 Jan 1997. Financial trouble and death By 1904, despite his inheritance and income, Paget had accumulated debts of ¬£544,000 (¬£ in ) and on 11 June was declared bankrupt. His lavish wardrobe, particularly his dressing gowns from Charvet, and jewels were sold to pay creditors, the jewels alone realising ¬£80,000. In 1905, Paget died in Monte Carlo following a long illness, with his ex-wife by his side, and his remains were returned to St Edwen's Church, Llanedwen, on his Anglesey estate, for burial. The Times reported that despite all that was known of him, he remained much liked by the people of Bangor, who were sorry to hear of his death. In 1909, Lilian, Marchioness of Anglesey, married John Francis Grey Gilliat (a banker) by whom she had three children. The title passed to his cousin Charles Henry Alexander Paget, who destroyed all the papers of the 5th Marquess and converted the Gaiety Theatre back into a chapel. It was at least in part owing to the debts left by the 5th Marquess that the family's principal English estate at Beaudesert, Staffordshire, had to be broken up and sold in the 1930s. The Paget family moved into Plas Newydd as their permanent residence. Legacy Plas Newydd remained in the possession of the Paget family until 1976, when it was gifted to the National Trust. Today the house and gardens are open to the public, and the house contains an art collection which includes a number of photographs of the 5th Marquess in theatrical costume. In March 2020, a diamond tiara worn by Paget that had been held back from the 1904 sale of Paget's effects was put up for auction by the Paget family at the 2020 European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht. The tiara was worn by Marjorie Paget, Marchioness of Anglesey at the Coronation of King George VI in 1937.The BBC source states that the tiara was worn in 1952 by Marjorie Paget, Marchioness of Anglesey at the Coronation of Elizabeth II. This is unlikely, given that Marjorie died in 1946. Paget's style has often been compared to that of the flamboyant rock star Freddie Mercury. In 2017 the actor and composer Seiriol Davies wrote and performed in How To Win Against History, a musical based on Paget's life. The award-winning show was performed at the 2017 Edinburgh Festival Fringe before a tour of Wales and England. In 2019 the show had its Irish premiere at the Dublin Theatre Festival.

The name was soon changed to Decades of Darkness and finally to Iron Fire.Hinds, Andy \\"[ Iron Fire Biography]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-03-30 They have released nine albums with their debut Thunderstorm coming out in 2000.  History  After releasing a demo in the late 1990s Iron Fire experienced a small breakthrough in 2000 when their debut album Thunderstorm was released on Noise Records. At the time the so-called true metal or power metal was in vogue in Europe with bands like HammerFall, Freedom Call, Nocturnal Rites, and Sonata Arctica all coming through. Iron Fire was a typical example of the style with their fast, melodic metal tunes paired with an imagery dominated by fire, swords, warriors, and dragons. Thunderstorm was produced by the Danish producer Tommy Hansen, who was known for the sound on the legendary Helloween albums Keeper of the 7 Keys pt. I and II. After the release of Thunderstorm, the band experienced some line-up changes with drummer Gunnar Olsen being replaced by Morten Plenge and guitarist Kristian Iversen by Martin Slott. They fell out with the label as their second album, On The Edge, did not prove as successful as their debut. The band, led by Steene, experienced with different sound, which was slightly more progressive with more emphasis on ballads. They did not want to repeat themselves, but ended up getting no support from the label. After this the band more or less fell apart and Steene had to rebuild a new line-up. This led to a break in album activities and a search for a new label. During that period the band produced two demos, while Steene was also working with Force of Evil formed by the two Mercyful Fate guitarists Michael Denner and Hank Shermann. In March 2006, Iron Fire fought their way back when they released the album, Revenge, under the Napalm Records label. Steene now had Kirk Backarach, who was to become a mainstay, with him on the guitar. Johan Jacob H. Olsen played the other guitar, Jens Berglid the drums, and Martin Lund the bass. Revenge saw a return towards pure metal with less experimentation, and the band began to establish themselves again. Their music was now marked by heavy riffage as a foundation for Steene's high pitched, and slightly sleaze inspired, vocals and catchy melodies. The band adopted a Viking theme in their artwork and in some of their lyrics. Revenge was followed by Blade of Triumph in 2007. After this effort drummer Jens Berglid left the band listing family issues as the reason. The band had time to find a replacement in Fritz Wagner before embarking on a Germany Tour of Triumph in 2007 with U.D.O and Primal Fear. At this time Martin Steene was also working with former band mates Gunnar Olsen and Martin Slott as well as Iron Fire bass player Martin Lund on their goth rock project Nightlight. Their album, Funeral of Love, was released in the winter 2009. Steene and Lund were busy as also Iron Fire's fifth album To the Grave was released in the winter 2009. With Johan Jacob H. Olsen out of the band Kirk Backarach was now handling the guitars alone on the album, while different guitarists filled in live. To the Grave marked the end of what can be seen as the band's Viking warrior trilogy. After an album, Metalmorphosized, released in 2010, which contained reworked versions of left-over material from then bands' first decade, they released the album Voyage of the Damned in 2012. It marked a turn towards sci-fi themed lyrics and artwork while also containing more keyboards (Rune Stiassny of the Danish doom metal band Saturnus), without losing the heaviness. A video clip was shot for the single Leviathan. In this video session guitarist Rune Stiassny can also be seen. He has since been a stable live musician for the band. Voyage of the Damned would be the last full album to feature drummer Fritz Wagner and Bassist Martin Lund. They both, however, played on the 2014 single A Token of My Hatred (a Virgin Steele cover), released on Crime Records. 2016 saw Iron Fire return to a more stripped down sound with the album Among the Dead where the band explored the zombie genre, the music still carried by heavy riffs paired with Steene's melodic vocals. Also former drummer Gunnar Olsen returned after being out of the band for 16 years. Olsen did, however, play in Steene's goth rock project Nightlight. After the release of Among the Dead the band played shows all over Denmark and a few in Norway, while already starting recordings for the next album.

Also referred to as gating or filtering, sensory gating prevents an overload of irrelevant information in the higher cortical centers of the brain. Sensory gating can also occur in different forms through changes in both perception and sensation, affected by various factors such as \\"arousal, recent stimulus exposure, and selective attention.D.A. Wilson, in The Senses: A Comprehensive Reference, 2008 Although sensory gating is largely automatic, it also occurs within the context of attention processing as the brain selectively seeks for goal-relevant information. Previous studies have shown a correlation between sensory gating and different cognitive functions, but there is not yet a solid evidence implying that the relationship between sensory gating and cognitive functions are modality-independent.  Cocktail party effect  The cocktail party effect illustrates how the brain inhibits input from environmental stimuli, while still processing sensory input from the attended stimulus. The cocktail party effect demonstrates sensory gating in hearing, but the other senses also go through the same process protecting primary cortical areas from being overwhelmed.  Neural regions involved  Information from sensory receptors make their way to the brain through neurons and synapse at the thalamus. The pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus plays a major role in attention, and has a major role in filtering out unnecessary information in regards to sensory gating. In a proven clinical study, it has been found out that the two stimuli (S1 and S2) are transported within 500ms between the clicks and 8 seconds between the pairs, in which S1 is known to generate a trace of memory that lingers presumably in the hippocampal region while the S2 the arrives later to be compared with the first stimuli as it gets inhibited if provided with no new information. (Both S1 and S2 are commonly referred to auditory stimuli caused by the machines used to test sensory gating.) The pulvinar nuclei in the thalamus function as the gatekeeper, deciding which information should be inhibited, and which should be sent to further cortical areas. The CNS (Central Nervous System), after the pulvinar nuclei deems the information to be irrelevant, acts as an essential inhibitory mechanism that prevents the information from flowing into higher cortical centers. Sensory gating is mediated by a network in the brain which involves the auditory cortex (AC), prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, as well as the olfactory cortex, which plays a part in sensory gating phenomenon. Other areas of the brain associated with sensory gating include the amygdala, striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, and mid-brain dopamine cell region (GABAergic neurons only). Research on sensory gating has been primarily occurring in cortical areas where the stimulus is consciously identified because it is a less invasive means of studying sensory gating. Studies on rats also show the brain stem, thalamus, and primary auditory cortex play a role in sensory gating for auditory stimuli.  Techniques for measurement  = Paired-click paradigm = The paired-click paradigm is a common non-invasive technique used to measure sensory gating, a type of event-related potential. For normal sensory gating, if a person hears a pair of clicks within 500 ms of one another, the person will gate out the second click because it is perceived as being redundant. Evidence of the gating can be seen in the P50 wave, occurring in the brain 50 ms after the click. Low values of the P50 wave indicate that sensory gating has occurred. High values of the P50 wave indicate a lack of sensory gating. Individuals with schizophrenia only reduce the amplitude of S2 by 10‚Äì20%, whereas individuals without schizophrenia reduce the amplitude of S2 by 80‚Äì90%. A subject wearing an electroencephalography cap, a conventional technique for measuring one's reactivity using sensory gating. = Other techniques = Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalographies (MEG) are used to measure brain responses and are common techniques for studying sensory gating. One type of EEG measure used for sensory gating research is the event-related potential (ERP). EEG research on sensory gating shows that gating starts almost immediately after receiving a stimulus. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown that an increased need to gate information is accompanied by increased engagement of the thalamus. P50 wave testing is one of many auditory event-related potential studies.  Sensory gating deficits and mental illness  = Schizophrenia = A large interest in sensory gating research is directed at improving deficits among people diagnosed with Schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia often have deficits in gating the neuronal response of the P50 wave, which is why P50 is the most widespread method for diagnosing people with Schizophrenia. The test is conducted through having the patients hear two uniform sounds with interval of 500 milliseconds. While the patients are hearing the sound, EEG cap is used to measure the brain activity in response to those sounds. A normal subject shows a decrease in brain activity while hearing a second sound, while a subject showing equal brain activity to the first sound has a high chance of Schizophrenia. Since people with schizophrenia can often have an overload of attended stimuli, the P50 wave may serve a critical role in illuminating sensory gating at a neurological level. Currently the test has been conducted on a mice as results have been identical to the human subjects in that the brain activity has decreased on the second sound. On the second experiment, the scientists have placed internal electrodes in the auditory regions of the brain. Contrary to most beliefs, it was found out that by the time the second sound occurred a drop in brain activity has already started from the brainstem. This discovery of filter effect activating as soon as it perceives a sound was used to carry out on a mice with \\"22q11 deletion syndrome\\", which is a symptom that leads to Schizophrenia on humans. The continued study, although not completely verified, seems to imply that filter system is indeed in a brainstem showing hopes for finding out the source of Schizophrenia.  Drug influences  = Nicotine = One reason people report they like smoking cigarettes is nicotine's ability to aid their selective attention. The nicotine causes the receptors to release nitric acid, which slows sensory inhibition causing a suppression of a subsequent stimuli. Due to its effect, nicotine can correct sensory gating deficits for individuals with schizophrenia (80% of schizophrenics smoke 30 cigarettes/day), although the effects only last about 30 minutes since the nicotine receptors desensitize quickly. The same self- medication is present among those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and even those on the autism spectrum as well.  Sensory gating and creativity  = Effects on creativity = Different research has been conducted on sensory gating, which claims how sensory gating may be connected to creative thinking. One experiment conducted in 2015 has started based on the premise that the leaky attention that people with high psychopathology usually experience, may lead to a more open level of thinking. Through the study, the researchers discovered that creative people tend to show reduced sensory gating, filtering out sound less than the normal subjects. The study has started based on the premise that the leaky attention that people with high psychopathology usually experience may lead to a more open level of thinking. Reduced ability to inhibit secondary information caused a wider range of unfiltered stimuli to come through a conscious brain enabling a creative person to integrate different ideas, rendering creative thinking. The experiment was carried out by 97 participants, whose creativity was measured through recording their achievements and conducting a divergent thinking test. After, sensory gating was measured through both the EEG and auditory clicks. The results proved that people with creative achievements did indeed show a reduced latent inhibition compared to the average subjects. Thus, the study showed evidence of a correlation between creativity and sensory gating with reduced filtering proving to be a mechanism for receiving larger range of stimuli leading to more creativity.

The offensive formed part of a series of attacks by the French Tenth Army and the British First Army in the Second Battle of Artois . After the failure of the breakthrough attempt by the First Army in the attack at Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915) tactics of a short hurricane bombardment and an infantry advance with unlimited objectives, were replaced by the French practice of slow and deliberate artillery-fire intended to prepare the way for an infantry attack. A continuous three-day bombardment by the British heavy artillery was planned, to cut wire and demolish German machine-gun posts and infantry strong points. The German defences were to be captured by a continuous attack, by one division from Rue du Bois to Chocolat Menier Corner and by a second division north, which was to capture the German trenches to the left of Festubert. The objectives were forward, rather than the depth of advance attempted at Aubers Ridge. The battle was the first British attempt at attrition. Background =Tactical developments= The Battle of Festubert was the continuation of the Battle of Aubers Ridge (9 May) and part of the larger French Second Battle of Artois. The resumption of the British offensive was intended to assist the French Tenth Army offensive against Vimy Ridge near Arras, by attracting German divisions to the British front, rather than reinforcing the defenders opposite the French. Prelude =British plan of attack= The attack was made by the British First Army under Sir Douglas Haig against a German salient between Neuve Chapelle to the north and the village of Festubert to the south. The assault was planned along a front and would initially be made mainly by Indian troops. This would be the first British army night attack of the war. Battle The battle was preceded by a bombardment by that fired about This bombardment failed to significantly damage the front line defences of the German 6th Army but the initial advance made some progress in good weather conditions. The attack was renewed on 16 May and by 19 May the 2nd Division and 7th Division had to be withdrawn due to their casualties. On 18 May, the 1st Canadian Division, assisted by the 51st (Highland) Division, attacked but made little progress in the face of German artillery fire. The British forces dug in at the new front line in heavy rain. The Germans brought up reinforcements and reinforced their defences. From the attack was resumed and Festubert was captured. The offensive had resulted in a advance. Aftermath =Casualties= The British lost from 15/16 to 25 May; the 2nd Division lost the 7th Division 47th Division had the Canadian Division lost and the 7th (Meerut) Division had The German defenders had including taken prisoner. French casualties during the Second Battle of Artois were and German casualties were Commemoration The 100th anniversary of the battle saw a range of commemorations held across the world. Some of the most poignant were those held in the Highlands of Scotland, in particular in shinty playing communities, which were affected disproportionately by losses in the battle. Skye Camanachd and Kingussie Camanachd, representing two areas which lost a great many men, were joined by the British Forces shinty team, SCOTS Camanachd for a weekend of commemorations, lectures, memorial services and shinty matches on the weekend of 15‚Äì17 May 2015 in Portree.

Over the years, Shelton has worked on the strip in collaboration with various writers and artists, including fellow UT Austin alums Tony Bell, Bill Killeen, and Joe E. Brown Jr. The humor of Wonder Wart-Hog works on many levels. Fundamentally, it is slapstick comedy in which excessive force is a constant theme. But it also parodies the McCarthyism and violence of the far right. Wonder Wart-Hog is a pro-establishment, law and order type personality, often gone overboard. For example, he's willing to kill a lady driver talking on her cell phone because she might cause an accident. Wonder Wart-Hog's rogues gallery includes \\"Super-Fool, Super-Hypnotist, the Masked Meanie, Super-Patriot, the Plastic Man, the Granny of Gruntville, the Bad Brainbender, Pie Man, the International Order of Bomb-Flinging Fiends, the Amazing Meanie Feul, the Famous Rushin' Bear, Evil Weevil, the Mafia, the Zymotic Zookeeper, Smiling Sergeant Death, the Elusive Chimerical Chameleon, and the Pigs from Uranus, among others.\\" The zany showdowns involve contests such as backward motorcycle races (who can go the slowest) or exposing some villain running a fraud scheme such as comet insurance. Wonder Wart-Hog dispatches his enemies in various ways, including dismemberment, grinding them into sausage, flinging them into orbit, or crushing them with his immense bulk. But on one occasion he punished a lynch mob by giving them Cadillacs and TV sets, and then banishing them to Mississippi.Shelton, Gilbert. \\"Wonder Wart-Hog Meets Super- Patriot!,\\" Texas Ranger (University of Texas Student Publications, Nov. 1962). Gilbert's humor occasionally crosses the line into violence of a sexual nature, but the emphasis is more on the absurdity of the situation than the act itself.  Fictional character biography  Wonder Wart-Hog is the son of the rulers of the planet Squootpeep, sent to Earth by rocket when Squootpeep's scientists predict the planet will soon explode. (In fact it does not.) The infant porker is raised in America by hillbillies, not out of affection, but because his invulnerability prevents his being killed and cooked. His secret identity is the mild-mannered reporter Philbert DeSanex, who works for the Muthalode Morning Mungpie.Shelton, Gilbert and Lieuen Adkins. \\"The Hog of Steel: Wonder Wart-Hog Meets the Elusive, Chimerical Chameleon!\\" Feds 'N' Heads (1968). Instead of being a human disguised as a rubber-masked monster, Wonder Wart-Hog is a pig-faced monster who disguises himself as a rubber-faced human. (Occasionally, however, Shelton has depicted Wonder Wart-Hog and DeSanex as two distinct individuals, with Wonder Wart-Hog residing inside the reporter's body.) Wonder Wart-Hog's one-time love interest is Lois Lamebrain ‚Äî an analog of Lois Lane ‚Äî whom he rapes and kills without mercy.Shelton, Gilbert. \\"Wonder Wart-hog Breaks Up the Muthalode Smut Ring,\\" Zap #4 (Print Mint, 1969). Origin and publication history  The idea for Wonder Wart-Hog came to Gilbert Shelton in 1961, while he was living in New York. The following year, Shelton moved back to Texas to enroll in graduate school and get student deferment from the draft. The first two Wonder Wart-Hog stories appeared in Bacchanal, a short-lived college humor magazine produced by former staffers at UT's humor magazine The Texas Ranger, in the winter/spring of 1962. Shelton then became editor of The Texas Ranger (where he had first published work in 1959)Texas Ranger (February 1959). and published more Wonder Wart-Hog stories. The character attracted the attention of Mademoiselle, which wrote about Wonder Wart-Hog in the August 1962 \\"College\\" issue.Holland, Richard A. The Texas Book: Profiles, History, and Reminiscences of the University (University of Texas Press, 2006), p. 229. Harvey Kurtzman's Help! also published a few of the Hog of Steel's adventures in 1964‚Äì1965.Fox, M. Steven. \\"Texas Ranger,\\" ComixJoint. Accessed Dec. 22, 2016. =Drag Cartoons= Pete Millar's DRAG Cartoons magazine published a Wonder Wart-Hog strip in the early 1960s. The first ongoing publication of Wonder Wart-Hog was in DRAG Cartoons issues 25-49 (1966‚Äì1968); several of those also featured another Shelton strip called Bull O'Fuzz. Issue #45 boasted several strips by Shelton, including a parody of West Side Story called \\"Vice Squad Story\\". Many of these strips were reprinted in 1968, when Millar Publishing Company released two issues of a quarterly Wonder Wart-Hog Magazine. 140,000 copies of each were printed, but distributors did not pick up the magazine and only 40,000 of each were sold. The following stories from Drag Cartoons have never been reprinted: * #26 \\"Constructs a Wheelie-Turnin‚Äô Toronado\\" (Apr. 1966) * #27 \\"Goes to Viet Nam\\" (May 1966) * #28 \\"Meets the Menace of the Plastic Man\\" (June 1966) * #30 \\"Meets The Granny of Gruntville\\" (Aug. 1966) * #31 \\"Masked Meanie‚Äôs Marine Malfeasance\\" (Sept. 1966) * #32 \\"Meets the Bad Brainbender\\" (Oct. 1966) * #33 \\"Pie Man‚Äôs Funny Car\\" (Nov. 1966) * #34 \\"Meets The Dread Nazi Menace\\" (Dec. 1966) * #40 \\"Meets Evil Weevil\\" (June 1967) * #41 \\"Becomes an Ace Photographer\\" (July 1967) * #42 \\"Gets a Flame Suit!\\" (Aug. 1967) =Underground comix= Wonder Wart-Hog's adventures were serialized in comic strip form in many underground newspapers and college newspapers from the mid-1960s through 1977. In 1968, while still living in Austin, Texas, Gilbert self-published Feds 'N' Heads, which featured Wonder Wart-Hog as well as Shelton's other creation, The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. (Feds 'N' Heads was later reprinted multiple times by the Bay Area underground publisher Print Mint.) Beginning late 1968, Wonder Wart-Hog began appearing in Zap Comix; he ultimately appeared in issue #3-5, 13, and 15 (the latter comic, published by Last Gasp in 2005, is the most recent appearance of the \\"Hog of Steel\\"). A Wonder Wart-Hog story also appeared in Radical America Komiks (Students for a Democratic Society, 1969), vol. III, #1 of Radical America, an SDS magazine. = Rip Off Press = By 1969, Shelton had moved to San Francisco, and that year he co-founded the underground publisher Rip Off Press with three friends from Texas: fellow cartoonist Jack Jackson, Fred Todd, and Dave Moriaty. Rip Off Press published the bulk of all later Wonder Wart-Hog comics. The character appeared in Rip Off Comix #1-12 (1977‚Äì1983) (with the exception of issue #7) and in several of the magazine-sized issues of Rip Off. His last new appearance in Rip Off Comix was in the 20th anniversary issue (#21) 1988. Many of the Wonder Wart-Hog stories from Rip Off Comix were collected in three comic books from Rip Off Press in the mid-1970s, (Not Only) The Best of Wonder Wart-Hog. These three issues reprint all of the Rip Off stories (but not all of the covers and single page appearances) except for the following: * \\"Battle of the Titans\\" chapters 3‚Äì5 (Rip Off #10-12) ‚Äî also released as a stand-alone comic; a collaboration among Shelton, Bell, and Joe E. Brown, Jr. that spanned 20 years from the start to the finish of the story * \\"Philbert Dessanex and the Street Entertainer\\" (Rip Off #14) In addition, the story from Radical America Komiks was reprinted in Wonder Wart-Hog and the Nurds of November, a trade paperback published by Rip Off Press in 1980, which included a large collection of earlier material. That story was also released as a stand-alone comic book version in 1988. Wonder Wart-Hog also appeared in the following one-shot Rip Off Press titles: * Underground Classics #5: \\"Wonder Wart-Hog Vol. 1\\" (1987) * Underground Classics #7: \\"Wonder Wart-Hog Vol. 2\\" (1988) * Underground Classics #12: Gilbert Shelton in 3D (1990) Three stories about Philbert Desanex from the trade paperback collection were released as a stand- alone comic, Philbert Desanex' Dreams (Rip Off Press, 1993). The stories center almost entirely around Wonder Wart-Hog's alter ego, with only a brief appearance by the Hog of Steel.  In popular culture  The USAF A-10 Warthog dates to the mid 1970s, the Wonder Warthog era Australian cartoonist Tony Edwards's best-known creation, Captain Goodvibes, was inspired by Wonder Wart- Hog. The lyrics for the Pink Fairies' \\"Pigs Of Uranus\\" (from the 1972 album What a Bunch of Sweeties) are taken from \\"Wonder Warthog and the Invasion of the Pigs from Uranus!\\" (Hydrogen Bomb and Biochemical Warfare Funnies, Rip Off Press, 1970).

It can be found in temperate and subtropical ocean waters nearly worldwide, though it is uncommon. It is typically associated with deep- sea corals, and schools are known to form over seamounts. Adults are demersal and search for prey along the ocean floor, primarily fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. Like other members of its family, it is remarkably long-lived, with individuals reaching ages of up to 69 years, and possibly longer. It can reach sizes of up to in length and in weight and is targeted by commercial fisheries. Its low reproductive rate and the time it takes for juveniles to mature make it vulnerable to expanding deep-sea fisheries, but it is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its extensive range. Taxonomy and phylogeny 1880 drawing of the alfonsino The first scientific description of the alfonsino was authored in 1829 by Georges Cuvier in the third volume of his 22-volume ichthyology collection, Histoire Naturelle des Poissons, who gave it the name Beryx dodecadactylus. It was renamed B. decadactylus by ichthyologist G. E. Maul in 1990. The etymology of its generic name is unclear, but it likely comes from the Greek name for a fish, but which species it was originally used for remains unknown. It is possible that Beryx originally described a species of parrotfish, or did not describe a fish at all. Description The alfonsino has large eyes and a deep, compressed body, 1.9-2.5 times its standard length at the greatest depth. It is a rose red color dorsally and orange ventrally. The rest of its body is silvery-pink, and the breast is yellow-white in color. Fins and the inside of the mouth are bright red. The anal fin is distinctly larger than in many fish species and its caudal fin is deeply forked. Its bright red color is a common adaptation to deepwater surroundings, where red is filtered out of the light spectrum. Although the most common size is , it can reach lengths of up to TL. The maximum published weight for an alfonsino is . Juveniles have heavy head spines, while adults do not. Distribution and habitat The alfonsino is found worldwide in subtropical and temperate waters, with a latitudinal range extending from 70¬∞N to 48¬∞S. It is found from as far north as Greenland and Iceland south to Brazil in the western Atlantic and South Africa in the eastern Atlantic. In the Indo-Pacific it is found from South Africa east to Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. It has also been reported off the coasts of Argentina and Hawaii. It is likely more common in the western Pacific than records indicate due to lack of fishing in its depth range in the region. With an extensive depth range below the surface, the alfonsino occurs in localized aggregations over deep-sea coral habitats on the continental shelf and continental slope. By day it stays in deeper water and vertically migrates to shallower waters at night. It is most commonly found deep in waters around in temperature, however depth range varies by region. In the eastern Atlantic its depth range is , while in the western Atlantic its depth range is , common depth range . Its depth range is largest in the Indo- Pacific, where it is found as deep as in the waters off of Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, La Reunion Island, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros, Seychelles, Korea, Japan, New Guinea, the Ryuku Islands, and Hawaii. Biology and ecology Alfonsinos hunt for prey along the ocean floor. The splendid alfonsino is the far more studied species of Beryx, but the alfonsino's biology is very similar to that of its congener. Alfonsinos are benthopelagic and aggregate over deep-ocean seamounts, typically near deep-sea corals. At night, they migrate vertically into shallower waters. Their primary food sources are crustaceans, cephalopods, and small fish, with the last being the most abundant prey in its diet. In this it is quite dissimilar from the splendid alfonsino, which appears to have a slower digestion and wider dietary breadth. Spawning occurs in the summer months, June through September, though males can reproduce year-round. Alfonsinos are batch spawners, that is they release eggs multiple times over an extended spawning season rather in a short period. Eggs and larvae are epipelagic, staying near the ocean's surface. Eggs hatch after around 27 hours and larvae are initially SL in size, identifiable by pigment near the brain. Flexion, when the larva bends upwards prior to development of the caudal fin, occurs at SL. Fin rays and scales are fully formed by SL. They are distinguished by elongated pelvic rays and anterior dorsal spines as well as pigment near the gas bladder, though they are very similar to the larvae of the splendid alfonsino. Juveniles live deeper, but are still pelagic for a few months, eventually moving to their demersal habitat where they will live as adults. After 4 years, they reach sexual maturity, at which point they will be about in size, with females being slightly larger on average than males. Individuals grow slowly, as is common among members of Berycidae. Although their maximum age is unknown, individuals have been caught at 69 years old. Their actual maximum age is unknown, however, with estimates ranging as high as 85 years. Human interaction Alfonsinos for sale Alfonsinos are economically important fish, targeted by commercial fisheries, including seamount fisheries, that employ deep-water trawling and longline fishing methods to catch them. It is of import to fisheries in Spain and Mauritania in the eastern Atlantic, the southeastern United States in the western Atlantic, and Japan, La Reunion Island, and the Canary Islands in the Indo-Pacific. It is also captured as bycatch of fisheries targeting the splendid alfonsino, though capture data likely does not distinguish between the two. This has led to concerns that stocks may be more depleted than previously thought. Of all Beryx species, the splendid alfonsino is the most commonly caught, but B. decadactylus makes up 95% of all Beryx catches off the southeastern United States. Despite being widespread throughout its range, the alfonsino is an uncommon fish in many areas, likely due to exploitation by commercial fisheries and depletion due to bycatch. It is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because its extensive distribution protects it from danger of extinction and in parts of its range it is not a targeted species. It could also be threatened by habitat loss due to deep-water trawling causing damage to deep-sea corals.

His first work of note was as a panegyrist in the retinue of Sultan Ibr√¢h√Æm's son Sayf al-Dawla Mahm√ªd, whose appointment to governor-general of India in 1076 Mas'ud marked with a qasideh. In prison In 1085, he was imprisoned, in the fortress of Nay, for his complicity with Sultan Ibr√¢h√Æm's son, Mahmud.C.E. Bosworth, The Later Ghaznavids, (Columbia University Press, 1977), 66. He was released by the sultan's successor Mas‚Äò√ªd III in 1096, who appointed him royal librarian. He came under the patronage of Ab√ª Nasri P√¢rs√Æ, deputy governor of India, and was appointed governor of Jallandar. Two years later, continued political changes resulted in a prison stay of 8 years, with his release in 1106. The last years of his life was spent in high favor, serving four consecutive sultans as librarian and panegyrist. Poetry He is known as a great Persian poet and is particularly notable for his use of conventional language and personal tone. Most of his works are written in the qasideh form. He has some poems in other styles such as quatrain and qet'eh. In the qasideh he followed the famous Unsuri. During one of his prison stays, he wrote the Tristia, a celebrated work of Persian poetry. He had relationships with some of the Persian poets, including Othman Mokhtari, Abu-al-Faraj Runi, and Sanai.

History =Background= The origins of Russian aviation go back to theoretical projects of the 1880s by pioneer Russian scientists such as Nikolai Kibalchich and Alexander Mozhaysky. During the 1890s aviation innovation was further advanced by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. In 1902‚Äì1903 during military maneuvers in the Kiev Military District, the Imperial Russian Army used several aerostats for reconnaissance and coordination of artillery fire.

Almost all of them were former pilots of IRAS. Command structure At the beginning of the war the basic Russian unit was the Otryad (or Squadron). Originally, these consisted of only six aircraft, but this was soon increased to ten, with two machines held in reserve. These Otryads were put together into Groups of three or four and, like their German counterparts on the Western Front, moved to strategic points on the Front where and when they were needed. Even larger groups of aircraft called Istrebitelnyi Divisyon (fighter wings) were attached to each Field Army.Christopher Chant, Austro-Hungarian Aces of World War I, Osprey Aircraft of the Aces, #46 (London: Osprey Publishing, 2002), pp. 17‚Äì18.

Much of this was due to the fact that Russian industry could not keep pace with demand. Imperial Russia did not possess the manufacturing capacity to produce engines and airframes in the numbers needed. Thus, the Czarist government relied heavily on imported engines and airframes from France and Britain.Alan Durkota, et al., The Imperial Russian Air Service: Famous Pilots & Aircraft of World War One (Mountain View, CA: Flying Machines Press, 1995), pp. 331‚Äì74. Russia's aircraft production slightly outpaced her Austrian opponent, who stayed in the war one year longer, produced about 5,000 aircraft and 4,000 engines between 1914 and 1918. Of course, the output of Russia and Austria-Hungary pale in comparison to the 20,000 aircraft and 38,000 engines produced by Italy and the more than 45,000 aircraft produced in Germany.Christopher Chant, Austro- Hungarian Aces of World War I, Osprey Aircraft of the Aces, #46 (London: Osprey Publishing, 2002), p. 16. Maintenance problems In addition to construction problems the Imperial Russian Air Service faced great difficulties in keeping the aircraft they did have in the air. Because it was so difficult to get new machines in a timely manner and because the Russians faced a shortage of aircraft for such a large front, the Russian high command kept out of date aircraft flying as long as possible.Alan Durkota, et at., The Imperial Russian Air Service: Famous Pilots & Aircraft of World War One (Mountain View, CA: Flying Machines Press, 1995), p. 7. Thus, Russian pilots flew obsolete machines in combat throughout the war in the face of much better enemy aircraft. The fact that so many obsolescent machines remained in service produced Otryads that were an eclectic mix of aircraft; some front line, others nearly so, and some that should not have been flying. With so many different engines and airframes from French, British and Russian factories, trying to keep the machines flying was a constant challenge for Imperial ground crews. One report from the American War Department dated August 24, 1916 stated that, \\"The great majority of Russian machines are very dangerous to fly, due to the lack of proper over-hauling and having been tinkered with by inexperienced men. Lack of spare parts induced the Russians to fit magnetos and sparking systems to motors for which they were not built, and this makes the wear and tear excessive all around.\\"Quoted in Alan Durkota, et al., The Imperial Russian Air Service: Famous Pilots & Aircraft of World War One (Mountain View, CA: Flying Machines Press, 1995), p. 7 n. 5. The synchronization gear dilemma The Imperial Russian Air Service, in common with other World War I air services, struggled to find a way of allowing a machine gun to fire safely through the spinning propeller of an aeroplane. The Russian High Command was tardy in realizing the necessity for arming its aircraft throughout 1914 and 1915, leaving frustrated aviators using such impromptu armaments as pistols, rifles, trolled anchors and cables, and other makeshifts. Part of the delay was caused by a paucity of light automatic weapons that an aircraft could lift. However, it became apparent that the ability to aim both gun and aircraft simultaneously was a great advantage in aerial combat.Kulikov 2013, pp. 8, 13‚Äì14. In late 1915, Naval Lieutenant Victor Dybovsky of the 20th KAO invented a system of cam plates mounted on an engine's crankshaft that would prevent a machine gun from holing an aeroplane's propeller. Static tests at the Lux Aircraft Works proved its feasibility by November 1915; towards the end of the month, Morane-Saulnier G serial no. MS567 was forwarded to the 30th KAO for field testing. Poruchik Mikhail Shadsky flew test flights on both 9 and 29 December; cold thickened the machine gun's lubricant both times, preventing it from firing.Kulikov 2013, pp. 13‚Äì14. When testing restarted in April 1916, Shadsky had more success. During April and May, he engaged the enemy about ten times. He shot down Austro-Hungarian aircraft on May 23 and 24 1916, but crashed to his death and his machine's destruction after the latter encounter. However, production of the interrupter gear was never carried out. Instead, Dybovsky was posted to England to inspect aircraft being constructed by the Royal Flying Corps. While in Britain he worked on a true synchronization gear with the British inventor Scarff; this became the \\"Scarff-Dibovski\\" system used by the British. Thus it was that by April 1917, Russian had only a couple of dozen fighter aircraft with synchronized guns. In the interim, praporshchik Victor Kulebakin was installing cam deflectors on another Morane-Saulnier's crankshaft. Testing in July 1917 showed that the deflectors did indeed pop out from under the aircraft's cowling to deflect any bullets that threatened the propeller. Although the modification was simple enough it could be fabricated in a unit's workshops, it was not widely used.

It was previously a shareware product but was released as freeware in 2002 or earlier. The game features a plot and characters based on Norse mythology, as well as tongue-in- cheek humor which becomes more apparent as the episodes are played. A bridge repairman parodies Star Trek when he responds to a request for a dental bridge with \\"Dammit, Thor! I'm a bridge and TV repairman, not a dentist!\\" Other examples of humor include countless references to sliding and non-stick surfaces in the second chapter, Non-Stick Nognir; in this chapter, the antagonist Nognir uses slave labor to mine Teflor, a parody of Teflon. Stores also feature catchy or humorous slogans, such as \\"Andy's Armor Repair. You scuff 'em, We buff 'em.\\" The third chapter features a blatantly anachronistic jigsaw for comedic effect, which Thor must use to escape a prison. The game also features several references to the Marvel Comics book character Thor. These include the idea of the Odinsleep, Loki's costume and a mention at the end that Thor should have his own comic book. On March 27, 2020, Ron Davis released the source code, music and sound effects as public domain software on SourceForge.god-of-thunder-1994-dos-game on sourceforge.net Plot The game chronicles the quest of Thor, son of Odin and god of thunder as he tries to reclaim Midgard for his father. Midgard, the beloved land of Odin's, was stolen from him during his \\"Odinsleep\\" by Loki, the god of mischief, with the help of Jormangund the serpent and Nognir, the Prince of the Underworld. To help in his quest, Thor is given the mythical hammer Mjolnir by Odin. As Thor progresses, he must solve puzzles set before him by Jormangund, Nognir and finally Loki. He also has to fight his way through the countryside, past city guards, and into the lairs of the gods. Along with puzzles and action, role- playing elements are included. Thor slowly gains more powers as he progresses, and his hammer and armor are upgraded when he defeats Jormangund and Nognir. Through the entire game, Odin watches over Thor and admonishes him if Mjolnir fells an innocent person. Gameplay Thor confronting Jormangund on his hidden island. God of Thunder features a top-down perspective with flip-screen scrolling. Thor's primary weapon is Mjolnir, a magical hammer which, when thrown, will return to Thor when it hits an object, an enemy, or the end of the screen. While returning, the hammer can pass through and damage multiple enemies. Mjolnir can also be used to flick switches, which control logs that come up from the ground and block passage. These logs are pointy, and kill Thor if he is standing over them while they come up. There are various other objects that block the path, each with different mechanics. For instance, barrels can be moved either horizontally or vertically depending on their orientation; some bushes can be destroyed to reveal secret entrances, and some rocks can be pushed; round rocks will keep rolling once touched nountil they reach an obstacle. Many puzzles feature snake-like enemies which cannot be harmed and will kill Thor instantly if he enters their line of sight; the player must block their view in order to pass. In addition to his hammer, Thor acquires items and abilities which cost magic to use and have various effects. The first, the enchanted apple, heals Thor; another item electrocutes any enemy nearby. Magic and health do not regenerate over time, so they must be bought in villages or acquired from the random pickup provided by each slain enemy. These dead foes may also drop jewels, the currency of the game. The color of any item determines its value; a red item is worth 10 blue items. Reception Comparing it to The Legend of Zelda, Computer Gaming World liked God of Thunders gameplay and puzzles. Dragon's Sandy Petersen gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.

A ballast tank is a compartment within a boat, ship or other floating structure that holds water, which is used as ballast to provide stability for a vessel. Using water in a tank provides easier weight adjustment than the stone or iron ballast used in older vessels. It also makes it easy for the crew to reduce a vessel's draft when they enter shallower water, by temporarily pumping out ballast. Airships use ballast tanks for similar advantages.  History  The basic concept behind the ballast tank can be seen in many forms of aquatic life, such as the blowfish or argonaut octopus,Discovery Blog: Scientists solve millennia-old mystery about the Argonaut octopus and the concept has been invented and reinvented many times by humans to serve a variety of purposes. The first documented example of a submarine using a ballast tank was in David Bushnell's Turtle, which was the first submarine to ever be used in combat. Also, in 1849 Abraham Lincoln, then an Illinois attorney, patented a ballast-tank system to enable cargo vessels to pass over shoals in North American rivers.  Ships  To provide adequate stability to vessels at sea, ballast weighs the ship down and lowers its centre of gravity. International agreements under the Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLAS) Convention require that cargo vessels and passenger ships be constructed to withstand certain kinds of damage. The criteria specify the separation of compartments within the vessel, and the subdivision of those compartments. These International agreements rely on the states that signed the agreement to implement the regulations within their waters and on vessels entitled to fly their flag. The ballast is generally seawater, pumped into ballast tanks. Depending on the type of vessel, the tanks can be double bottom (extending across the breadth of the vessel), wing tanks (located on the outboard area from keel to deck) or hopper tanks (occupying the upper corner section between hull and main deck). These ballast tanks are connected to pumps that pump water in or out. Crews fill these tanks to add weight to the ship and improve its stability when it isn't carrying cargo. In extreme conditions, a crew may pump ballast water into dedicated cargo spaces to add extra weight during heavy weather or to pass under low bridges.  Submarines  Ballast locations on a submarine. In submersibles and submarines, ballast tanks are used to control the buoyancy of the vessel. Some submersibles, such as bathyscaphes, dive and re-surface solely by controlling their buoyancy. They flood ballast tanks to submerge, then to re-surface either drop discardable ballast weights, or use stored compressed air to blow their ballast tanks clear of water, becoming buoyant again. Submarines are larger, more sophisticated and have powerful underwater propulsion. They must travel horizontal distances submerged, require precise control of depth, yet do not descend so deeply, nor need to dive vertically on station. Their primary means of controlling depth are thus their diving planes (hydroplanes in UK), in combination with forward motion. At the surface the ballast tanks are emptied to give positive buoyancy. When diving, the tanks are partially flooded to achieve neutral buoyancy. The planes are then adjusted together to drive the hull downwards, whilst still level. For a steeper dive, the stern planes may be reversed and used to pitch the hull downwards. The crew submerges the vessel by opening vents in the top of the ballast tanks and opening valves in the bottom. This lets water flood into the tank as air escapes through the top vents. As air escapes from the tank, the vessel's buoyancy decreases, causing it to sink. For the submarine to surface, the crew shuts the vents in the top of the ballast tanks and releases compressed air into the tanks. The high-pressure air pocket pushes the water out through the bottom valves and increases the vessel's buoyancy, causing it to rise. A submarine may have several types of ballast tank: main ballast tanks for diving and surfacing, and trimming tanks for adjusting the submarine's attitude (its 'trim') both on the surface and when underwater. Floating structures Ballast tanks are also integral to the stability and operation of deepwater offshore oil platforms and floating wind turbines. The ballast facilitates \\"hydrodynamic stability by moving the center-of-mass as low as possible, placing [it] beneath the [air-filled] buoyancy tank.\\" Wakeboard boats Most wakeboard-specific inboard-engine boats have multiple integrated ballast tanks that are filled with ballast pumps controlled from the helm with rocker switches. Typically the configuration is based on a three tank system with a tank in the center of the boat and two more in the rear of the boat on either side of the engine compartment. Just like larger ships when adding water ballast to smaller wakeboard boats the hull has a lower center of gravity, and increases the draft of the boat. Most wakeboard boat factory ballast systems can be upgraded with larger capacities by adding soft structured ballast bags. Environmental concerns Diagram showing the water pollution of the seas from untreated ballast water discharges Ballast water taken into a tank from one body of water and discharged in another body of water can introduce invasive species of aquatic life. The taking in of water from ballast tanks has been responsible for the introduction of species that cause environmental and economic damage. For example, zebra mussels in the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States. Non native macroinvertebrates can find their way into a ballast tank. This can cause problems ecologically and economically. Macro-invertebrates are transported by transoceanic and coastal vessels arriving in ports all over the world. Researchers from Switzerland sampled 67 ballast tanks from 62 different vessels operating along geographic pathways, and tested for mid ocean exchange or voyage length that had a high chance of macro-invertebrate relocating to a different part of the world. An assessment was done between the relationship of macro-invertebrate presence, and the amount of sediment in ballast tanks. They discovered a presence of a highly invasive European green crab, mud crab, common periwinkle, soft shell clam, and blue mussel in the ballast tanks of the sampled ships. Although the densities of macro-invertebrate were low, invasion of non-native macro- invertebrates can be worrisome during their mating season. The worst thing that can happen is if a female macro-invertebrate is carrying millions of eggs per animal.Briski, E. , Ghabooli, S. , Bailey, S. , & MacIsaac, H. (2012). Invasion risk posed by macroinvertebrates transported in ships' ballast tanks. Biological Invasions, 14(9), 1843‚Äì1850. Migration of living animals and settling particle-attached organisms can lead to an uneven distributions of biota at different locations of the world. When small organisms escape from a ballast tank, the foreign organism or animal can upset the balance of the local habitat and potentially damage the existing animal life. Vessel workers check the ballast tank for living organisms ‚â•50 Œºm in discrete segments of the drain, it also represents the level of sedimentary of different rock or soil in the tank. Throughout the sample collection, concentrations of organisms and marine life varied in result in the drain segments, patterns also varied in level of stratification in other trials. The best sampling strategy for stratified tanks is to collect various time-integrated samples spaced evenly throughout each discharge.Robbins-Wamsley, S. , Riley, S. , Moser, C. , Smith, G. , et al. (2013). Stratification of living organisms in ballast tanks: How do organism concentrations vary as ballast water is discharged?.Environmental Science & Technology, 47(9), 4442. All Transoceanic vessels that enter the Great Lakes are required to manage ballast water and ballast tank residuals with ballast water to clear out and exchange for tank flushing. Management and procedures reduce the density and richness of biota effectively in ballast waters and thus reduce the risk of transporting organisms from other parts of the world to non-native areas. Although most ships do ballast water management not all are able to clear the tanks. In an emergency, when the crew can clean out residual organisms, they use sodium chloride (salt) brine to treat the ballast tanks. Vessels arriving in the Great Lakes, and North Sea ports, were exposed to high concentrations of sodium chloride until the mortality rate of 100% is reached. Results show that an exposure of 115% of brine is extremely effective treatment resulting in a 99.9 mortality rate of living organisms in ballast tanks regardless of the type of organism. There was a median of 0%. About 0.00‚Äì5.33 of organisms are expect to survive treatment of the sodium chloride.Bradie, J. , Velde, G. , MacIsaac, H. , & Bailey, S. (2010). Brine- induced mortality of non-indigenous invertebrates in residual ballast water.Marine Environmental Research, 70(5), 395‚Äì401. The Ballast Water Management Convention, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on 13 February 2004, aims to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another, by establishing standards and procedures for the management and control of ships' ballast water and sediments. This will enter into force worldwide on 8 September 2017. Under the Convention, all ships in international traffic are required to manage their ballast water and sediments to a certain standard, according to a ship-specific ballast water management plan. All ships will also have to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast water management certificate. The ballast water management standards will be phased in over a period of time. As an intermediate solution, ships should exchange ballast water mid-ocean. However, eventually most ships will need to install an on-board ballast water treatment system. A number of guidelines have been developed to help implement the Convention. The Convention will require all ships to implement a Ballast Water and Sediments Management Plan. All ships will have to carry a Ballast Water Record Book and will be required to carry out ballast water management procedures to a given standard. Existing ships will be required to do the same, but after a phase-in period.International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM),http://www.imo.org/en/About/conventions/listofconventions/pages/international- convention-for-the-control-and-management-of-ships'-ballast-water-and- sediments-(bwm).aspx One of the most common problems among vessel construction and maintenance is the corrosion that takes place in the double hull space ballast tanks have in merchant vessels.De Baere, K. , Verstraelen, H. , Rigo, P. , Van Passel, S. , Lenaerts, S. , et al. (2013). Reducing the cost of ballast tank corrosion: An economic modeling approach.Marine Structures, 32, 136‚Äì152. Bio-degradation takes place in ballast tank coatings in marine environments. Ballast tanks can carry more than ballast water, usually carrying other bacteria or organisms. Some bacteria picked up from other parts of the world can damage the ballast tank. Bacteria from a ship's port of origin or from visited regions can break down ballast tank coatings. The natural bacteria community can interact with the natural bio-films with the coating. Researchers have shown that biological activity indeed significantly affects the coating properties.Heyer, A. , D'Souza, F. , Zhang, X. , Ferrari, G. , Mol, J. , et al. (2014). Biodegradation of ballast tank coating investigated by impedance spectroscopy and microscopy. Biodegradation, 25(1), 67‚Äì83. Micro-cracks and small holes have been found in ballast tanks. Acidic bacteria created holes with 0.2‚Äì0.9 Œºm in length and 4‚Äì9 Œºm in width. The natural community caused cracks of 2‚Äì8 Œºm in depth and 1 Œºm in length. The bacterial affected coatings decreased in corrosion resistance, as assessed by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).Heyer, A. , D'Souza, F. , Zhang, X., Ferrari, G. , Mol, J. , et al. (2014). Biodegradation of ballast tank coating investigated by impedance spectroscopy and microscopy. Biodegradation, 25(1), 67‚Äì83. The natural bacterial community causes a loss in coating corrosion resistance over time, declining after 40 days of exposure, resulting in blisters in the ballast tank surface. Bacteria might be linked to certain bio-film patterns affecting various types of coating attacks.Heyer, A. , D'Souza, F. , Zhang, X. , Ferrari, G. , Mol, J. , et al. (2014).

A base of operations within a foreign country with which a resident spy may liaise is known as a \\"station\\" in English and a (, 'residency') in Russian. What the U.S. would call a \\"station chief\\", the head spy, is known as a () in Russian.  Types of resident spies  In the former Soviet Union and Russian nomenclature, there were two types of resident spies: ' (, legal resident spy) and ' (, illegal resident spy). In U.S. parlance, the same distinction is between \\"official cover\\" and \\"non-official cover\\". A legal resident spy operates in a foreign country under official cover (such as from his country's embassy). He is an official member of the consular staff, such as a commercial, cultural, or military attach√©. He has diplomatic immunity from prosecution and cannot be arrested by the host country if suspected of espionage. The host country can expel such a person, requiring them to return to their home country as persona non grata. An illegal resident spy operates under non-official cover. They cannot claim immunity from prosecution when arrested. They may operate under a false name and have documents purportedly establishing them as a national of the country, or from a different country than the one for which they are spying. Examples of such illegals include Rudolf Abel, who operated in the United States; and Gordon Lonsdale, who was born in Russia, claimed to be Canadian, and operated in Britain. Famous Soviet and Russian \\"illegals\\" include Richard Sorge, Walter Krivitsky, Alexander Ulanovsky, and Anna Chapman, who was also known as a sleeper agent.  Comparison of illegal and legal resident spies  The advantages and disadvantages of legal resident spies are similar to those of illegal resident spies. A legal resident spy has the advantage of diplomatic status, but the disadvantage of being a known foreigner to the host country and one of just a few official diplomatic staff. Their intelligence status may be easy for counterintelligence agencies to discern or suspect. On the other hand, an illegal resident spy has the advantage of being unknown as a foreigner to the host country, and one among millions of the country's ordinary citizens. The disadvantage is the lack of diplomatic immunity to fall back upon in case of arrest. A legal resident spy has opportunities to meet high-level personnel of the host country as part of \\"official\\" business, and an illegal resident spy does not. However, conversely, illegal resident spies have easier access to a wide range of potential sources who would be put off by having to approach and deal with an openly foreign official. They often keep secret from contacts the country for which they officially work. Also, an illegal resident spy can stay in the host country if diplomatic relations break down. Legal resident spies are forced to leave with the diplomatic mission. A legal resident spy is easier to pay, for the salary can be openly incorporated into the diplomatic payroll. Making arrangements to pay illegal resident spies can be difficult, sometimes involving ruses that are more expensive and complex to administer than paying a diplomatic official would be. Espionage agencies may arrange to pay a host country organization or corporation to allow the illegal resident spy to pose as a member of its staff and be nominally paid by that organization/corporation. A legal resident spy has full and aboveboard access to embassy facilities for secure communications, meetings, and other services. An illegal resident spy has little to no access to such facilities, and communications arrangements are thus more difficult and time-consuming. An illegal resident spy will usually have a falsified biography. A legal resident spy may be at risk by having an official biography that documents their diplomatic career and provides useful clues to counterintelligence services about their intelligence activities and connections.

ISSMA has sanctioned the event annually since 1981; from 1973 until 1980 the top bands from the NISBOVA and ISSMA circuits met in the All-State Marching Band Contest.  Format  Bands are split into four classes‚ÄîA, B, C, and D‚Äîdetermined by the size of the school the band represents, though bands are permitted to participate in the class immediately larger than the one they would otherwise be assigned to if they wish. Prior to 1983, bands were assigned to one of seven District sites around the state. Bands receiving a Division I rating at their District advanced to State Preliminaries for their class, and the top five bands from each class preliminary performed in that class's State Finals the same evening. Beginning in 1983, State Preliminaries was removed, and instead bands receiving a Division I rating at District competition advanced to, depending on their geographic location, either the North Regional or South Regional for their class, two weeks after District. The top five bands from each regional in each class then advanced to State Finals the following week, resulting in ten bands per class at Finals. Numerical division ratings were replaced with Gold/Silver/Bronze/Participation ratings in 2004, but otherwise the format remained essentially unchanged through 2007. Beginning in 2008, the top ten bands from each class at each Regional site will advance to a new Semi-State round of competition, held the week immediately following Regionals (historically the week that State Finals has been held). Of the twenty bands in each class at Semi-State, the top ten will then advance to State Finals the following week.  Scheduling  From 1983 through 2007, State Finals was typically scheduled for either the seventh or eighth Saturday after Labor Day (depending on how early in September Labor Day fell), with Regionals being the Saturday prior and District two or three Saturdays before Regionals. An open weekend was allotted between District and Regionals should a change of date for District be necessitated by inclement weather (should it not be needed, it was typically filled with unsanctioned invitational competitions); however, no such weekend was allotted between Regionals and State Finals due to the difficulty of securing venues for the final two stages of competition. The weekends prior to District, generally beginning with the first Saturday after Labor Day, were used for various unsanctioned invitational competitions organized by high schools and, occasionally, colleges or other independent organizations. Beginning in 2008, State Finals was pushed back to the first Saturday in November, on the ninth Saturday after Labor Day. The move was necessitated by the decision of the administrators of the Indiana Convention Center (directly adjacent to the brand-new Lucas Oil Stadium that would be used by the Marching Band State Finals) to schedule the Future Farmers of America National Convention on the weekend that had historically been used for State Finals. To create a truer top ten bands from around the state, ISSMA created the semi-state round. Previously, it was merely the top five from each of the regions. The schedule up to and including Regionals weekend remains the same.

Pocket pistols were popular in the United States until the 1950s and 1960s, when most states passed laws limiting or prohibiting the carry of concealed weapons. However, the passage of \\"shall issue\\" firearms license laws in the mid-1990s, resulted in a resurgence in the popularity of pocket pistol in the United States, creating new markets for small, simple, reliable, concealed carry firearms. In general use, the term pocket pistol is purely descriptive, but \\"mouse gun\\" (used especially for those of the smallest calibers) is often a pejorative. Likewise, pocket pistols, due to their small size, often are lumped in with Saturday night specials, another pejorative term, which are typically inexpensive small caliber handguns. History The pocket pistol originated in the mid-17th century as a small, concealable flintlock known as the Queen Anne pistol, the coat pistol, or the pocket pistol. This was used throughout the 18th century, evolving from a weapon reserved for the wealthy to a common sidearm in broader use as more and more manufacturers made them by the start of the 19th century. Original Remington Model 95 derringer The original 19th century vest-sized pocket pistol was the Philadelphia Deringer. The advent of the metallic cartridge gave us the classic double barrel .41 Rimfire Remington Model 95 which achieved such widespread popularity, that it has completely overshadowed all other designs, becoming synonymous with the word \\"Derringer\\". The Remington double-barrel derringer design is still being manufactured (150 years after they were first introduced) by American Derringer, Bond Arms, and Cobra Arms, all of whom manufacture derringers in a variety of calibers from .22 long rifle to .45 Long Colt & .410 gauge. .32 caliber Smith & Wesson Safety Hammerless Introduced in the late 19th century snubnosed revolvers such as the \\"Banker Special\\", \\"Sheriff's Model\\", and \\"Shopkeeper Special\\" versions of the Colt Single Action Army revolvers were made by Colt's Manufacturing Company. The Smith & Wesson Safety Hammerless models were produced from 1887 to just before World War II. They were chambered in either .32 S&W; or .38 S&W; with a 5-shot cylinder. They were most often produced with a 2-inch, 3-inch, or 3.5-inch barrels. These top-break revolvers were designed for fast reloading and concealed carry as the hammer was internal and would not snag on drawing the revolver from a pocket. They also had a grip safety. They were known as \\"The New Departure\\" to reflect the company's new approach to designing revolvers. The design of these revolvers sacrifices power and range for maneuverability and concealment. Similar \\"hammerless\\" designs proved popular with other manufacturers such as Iver Johnson and Harrington & Richardson. In 1952, Smith & Wesson introduced the more modern hand ejector model the Smith & Wesson Centennial Model 40. Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless The Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless is a 9-shot, .32 ACP caliber, self-loading, semi-automatic pistol designed by John Browning and built by Colt Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. The Colt Model 1908 Pocket Hammerless is an 8-shot, .380 ACP caliber variant introduced five years later. Despite the title \\"hammerless\\", the Model 1903 does have a hammer. It is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide. This allows the pistol to be carried in, and withdrawn from a pocket quickly and smoothly without snagging. Browning pocket FN1906 pistols, .25 Auto, various issues. Three different Safe systems. The first widely used and successfully semi- automatic .25 ACP pocket pistols were the FN Model 1905, Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket and later the Baby Browning. The FN 1905 was designed and marketed along with .25 ACP cartridge in 1905. The M1905 is a very small 7-shot, striker-fired, single action, blow-back operated semi-automatic pistol. It features a grip safety and the manual thumb operated safety that locks the slide in the closed position when engaged. FN Model 1910 The FN Model 1910, also known as the Browning model 1910, was a departure for Browning. Before, his designs were produced by both FN in Europe and Colt Firearms in the United States. Since Colt did not want to produce it, Browning chose to patent and produce this design in Europe only. Introduced in 1910, this pistol used a novel operating spring location surrounding the barrel. This location became the standard in such future weapons as the Walther PP and Russian Makarov. The Model 1910 incorporated the standard Browning striker-firing mechanism and a grip safety along with a magazine safety and an external safety lever (known as the \\"triple safety\\") in a compact package. It was offered in both .32 ACP (8-shot) and .380 ACP (7-shot) calibers, it remained in production until 1983. It is possible to switch calibres by changing only the barrel. Also noteworthy for European pocket pistols are the Mauser Model 1910 and Mauser Model 1914, chambered for .25 ACP and .32 ACP respectively, both of blowback and hammerless design, which were very popular as civilian small handguns. The .32ACP version was considered powerful enough for the Kriegsmarine as well as security forces of the Third Reich, and reworked as the Mauser Model 1934, with only minor modifications. The Mauser HSC, produced during the war in .32 ACP for the Navy and later police and army units, saw substantial production and sales after the war (upgraded to .380 ACP), and was successfully introduced to the US market. Colt Detective Special The Colt Detective Special is a carbon steel framed double-action, snubnosed, 6-shot revolver. As the name \\"Detective Special\\" suggests, this model revolver was used as a concealed weapon by plainclothes police detectives. It was made with either a 2-inch or 3-inch barrel. Introduced in 1927, the Detective Special was the first snubnosed revolvers produced with a modern swing-out frame. It was designed from the outset to be chambered for higher-powered cartridges such as the .38 Special, considered to be a powerful caliber for a concealable pocket revolver of the day. James Bond's gun in many of the films and novels: Ian Fleming's choice of the Walther PPK directly influenced its popularity and its notoriety. The Walther PP (Polizeipistole, or police pistol) series pistols were introduced in 1929 and are among the world's first successful double action, blowback-operated semi-automatic pistols, developed by the German arms manufacturer Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen. They feature exposed hammers, a traditional double-action trigger mechanism, and a fixed barrel that also acts as the guide rod for the recoil spring. It was offered in both .32 ACP (9-shot) and .380 ACP (8-shot) calibers. The Walther PP and smaller PPK models were both popular with European police and civilians for being reliable and concealable. They would remain the standard issue police pistol for much of Europe well into the 1970s and 80s. During World War II, they were issued to the German military, including the Luftwaffe. Smith & Wesson Model 36 The Smith & Wesson Model 36 was designed in the era just after World War II, when Smith & Wesson stopped producing war materials and resumed normal production. For the Model 36, they designed a small concealable 5-shot revolver with a 2\\" barrel that could fire the more powerful .38 Special cartridge. Since the older I-frame was not able to handle this load, a new frame was designed, which became the J-frame. The new design was introduced at the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) convention in 1950, and was favorably received. A vote was held to name the new revolver, and the name \\"Chiefs Special\\" won.Ayoob, Massad. Greatest Handguns of the World (Krause Publications, Inc., 2010) p. 208; Jinks, Roy G. History of Smith & Wesson (Beinfeld Publishing,1977), p. 225. A -barreled version design went into production immediately, due to high demand. It was available in either a blued or nickel-plated finish.\\"Armed for Personal Defense\\" By Jerry Ahern It was produced as the \\"Chiefs Special\\" until 1957, when it then became the Model 36. Smith & Wesson would also introduced the J-frame Smith & Wesson Centennial (hammerless models) and Smith & Wesson Bodyguard (shrouded hammer) models. Makarov pistol The Makarov pistol was introduced in 1951. As the new standard issue sidearm for all Soviet military, police and security forces it was intended to be carried both holstered and concealed. It can still found in front-line service with Russian military, police and security forces. The Makarov is a medium-size, 9-shot, 9x18mm, blowback-operated, all-steel construction pistol. The general layout and field-strip procedure of the Makarov pistol is similar to that of the Walther PP. The 9√ó18mm cartridge is a practical cartridge in blowback-operated pistols; producing a respectable level of energy from a gun of moderate weight and size. Other, more powerful cartridges have been used in blowback pistol designs, but the Makarov is widely regarded as particularly well balanced in its design elements. Beretta .25ACP Jetfire with the tip-up barrel open The Beretta 950s are 9-shot, .25 ACP (Jetfire) or .22 Short (Minx) semi-automatic pistols introduced by Beretta in 1952. They build on a long line of small and compact pocket pistols manufactured by Beretta. They are very simple and reliable blowback operated pistols with a single action trigger mechanism. Their frames are made out of aluminum alloy, their slides and barrels are carbon steel. They feature a unique tip-up barrel for ease of loading. Early models (*950* and *950B* Pre-1968) do not have a safety lever, employing a half-cock notch on the hammer instead. Later models (*950BS* Post-1968) are provided with an manual safety lever. In 1984 Beretta would introduce a double-action version the Beretta 21A Bobcat. And, in 1996 they introduced the larger .32 ACP Beretta 3032 Tomcat. Raven MP25 The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibiting the importation of inexpensive handguns prompted George Jennings to design the Raven MP-25, an inexpensive 7-shot, .25 ACP semi-automatic pistol. Jennings kept costs to a minimum by manufacturing the Raven from injection-molded Zamak, a zinc alloy. It came in chrome, satin nickel or black finish. The grips can be either wood or imitation mother-of-pearl handles. Raven has been referred to as the original \\"Ring of Fire\\" company. Along with Jennings Firearms (later Bryco Arms, now Jimenez Arms), Phoenix Arms, Lorcin Engineering Company, Davis Industries, and Sundance Industries, they were known for making similar cast zinc alloy Saturday night special type pistols. H&K; PSP In 1976, the Heckler & Koch P7 (AKA: PSP) was introduced. These were small 9-shot, 9 mm Luger pistols that featured a unique front strap grip safety that allowed them to be carried safely not only holstered but, concealed in a pocket. They were designed to replace the .32 ACP Walther PP in German service, with a similarly sized but more effective 9√ó19mm Parabellum pistol. Between 1982‚Äì1983 the P7 received several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications resulted in the P7M8 model. A new magazine release lever (available on both sides of the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The P7M13 was also introduced with a 13-round double-stack magazine. Seecamp LWS 32 .32 ACP semi-automatic pistol In the mid 1980s, particularly small and high-quality pocket pistols were introduced, such as the 7-shot, .32 ACP Seecamp LWS 32. These modern double-action only pistols are safer to carry than the older single-action designs. Often selling for significantly more than its US$600 retail price. During the mid-1990s, demand so far exceeded supply that contracts for guns were sold up to two years before the guns themselves were produced, and the guns themselves were then often resold for as much as $1100 USD upon delivery. North American Arms model NAA22S mini-revolver, chambered in .22 Short. North American Arms Mini- Revolvers (often called derringers) are 5-shot, .22 rimfire, single action revolvers, which have a spur trigger design. They are reminiscent of late 19th century pocket revolvers, only much smaller and made completely of stainless steel. Mini-revolvers were developed by Freedom Arms in 1978, which stopped selling them in 1990 and then sold the design to North American Arms. Since then, North American Arms has further evolved the design, switching to a safety cylinder design, featuring notches machined halfway between the chambers. As a result, the revolver may be safely carried with all five chambers loaded by resting the hammer in a safety notch. Older NAA mini- revolvers can be retrofitted with this safety cylinder design upgrade at no cost to the owner simply by returning an older design NAA mini-revolver to North American Arms for an upgrade. 9mm Luger Kel-Tec-P-11 with its 10 shot magazine More recently, modern pistols with polymer-frames have been introduced, such as the 8-shot, .32 ACP Kel-Tec P-32 and 9 mm Luger Kel-Tec P11. The P-11 uses an aluminum receiver inside a polymer grip housing held on with polymer pins. The slide, barrel, and magazine are steel. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, or 12 rounds in states not limited to 10-round magazines. Both fit flush to the bottom of the pistol. At unloaded, the handgun itself is comparatively light. The P-11 lacks an external manual safety, relying instead on a long and heavy double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires 9 pounds of pressure, to prevent accidental discharge. A firing pin spring and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the gun is dropped. The P-11 will also accept some Smith & Wesson 59 series magazines.\\"P-11.\\" Kel- Tec. Kel-Tec-CNC.com An available adapter wraps around the base of 15-round Smith & Wesson model 59-style magazines. The light weight P11s introduced the \\"subcompact\\" concept. Prompting, other manufactures such as Glock and Springfield Armory to introduce similar pistols. tritium night sights in 9√ó19mm Parabellum The Glock 26 is a 9√ó19mm \\"subcompact\\" variant designed for concealed carry and was introduced in 1995, mainly for the civilian market. It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26. More than simply a \\"shortened\\" Glock 19, design of the subcompact Glock 26 required extensive rework of the frame, locking block, and spring assembly that features a dual recoil spring. Calibers Semi-automatic pocket pistols are typically .22 LR, .25 ACP, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP caliber for the older designs. However, newer subcompact designs are also made in 9 mm Luger, .40 Smith & Wesson and .45 ACP. These pistols typically have magazine capacities ranging from 5 to 10 rounds. Pocket revolvers typically range from .22 LR to .38 Special for the older designs. However, the newer designs are also made in .357 Magnum. These revolvers typically hold 5 to 9 rounds depending on the caliber. Derringers such as the older Remington Model 95 were chambered for .41 Rimfire. However, modern derringers are chambered for everything from .22 LR to .45-70 Government, even .410 gauge shotgun shells, with the .22 LR, .357 Magnum and .45 Colt being among the most popular calibers. Today, double barrel derringers are the norm. However, both single and four barrel derringers have also been made. Concealed carry Pocket pistols as the name suggests are usually small pistols carried in a coat, jacket or trouser pocket. They are used for concealed carry by those desiring a discrete self-defense gun, or desiring to carry a backup gun. They are point and shoot pistols, intended for fast one- handed operation. The typical .25 ACP pocket pistol is designed for close range work and has an effective range of about 7 yards (6.5 m)..25 ACP Pocket Pistols. Chuck Hawks. 2013 An example of a Beretta TomCat pocket pistol in a leather holster Pocket pistols are typically hammerless designs, made with rounded edges and with few controls, to prevent snagging and to make them easier to carry. Revolvers are also typically hammerless, or have shrouded, or even bobbed hammers, all allowing the gun to be drawn quickly with little risk of it snagging on clothing. The shrouded and hammerless models may even be fired through a coat or jacket pocket.Gun Review: 5-Shot Snub-Nosed Revolver. Scott W. Wagner. 06/17/2015 While some of the cheaper semi-auto pistols are best carried with an empty chamber, higher quality pocket pistols are designed to be carried with a round chambered and with a safety engaged (ON). Many older pistols (and even some revolvers) also had grip safeties for additional security. However, the newer double-action-only pistols are made without manually operated safeties, but with a long and heavy trigger-pulls ‚Äì similar to revolvers. Pocket holsters are highly recommended for the safer carry of pocket pistols, with standard practice being to carry the holster (sometimes with a second magazine sub-pocket stitched into the holster) in a front or rear trouser pocket with nothing else carried in the pocket that could snag on the gun when drawn. The most popular pocket holster designs are typically made of form-fitted leather, with a heavy layer of leather worn outward from the body to prevent printing of the gun outline on tight clothing, although Kydex holsters are also used, especially for thicker pocket pistols for which the added thickness of a leather holster would cause an excessive overall thickness. The use of moisture and vapor-barrier layers in the holster stitched closer to the body in the holster is recommended to prevent damaging the finish of the pocket pistol due to sweat. This extra layer also serves to increase carry comfort, and to prevent chapping or blistering the skin under the holster due to repetitive motion rubbing or friction that can occur while walking, jogging, or running. Pocket pistols are derided by some gun enthusiasts who claim that they provide inadequate self-defense due to their small size, small caliber and poor sights. Still, the numbers sold speak of a wide degree of popularity, with some models having been sold in quantities in excess of 3 million over 30 or more years.

Biography =Early career= She recorded the eponymous Howdy Moon as a member of folk group Howdy Moon in 1974. She later left the group to release her first solo album, Just a Stone's Throw Away, in 1977, under ARC/Columbia. Just a Stone's Throw Away featured guest appearances from artists such as Maurice White, Lowell George, Bill Payne, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and Deniece Williams. In 1979 Carter went on to release her second album Wild Child, again under the ARC/Columbia imprint. Wild Child was produced by James Newton Howard. In 1996, Carter returned with The Way It Is, in which she covered songs by Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Van Morrison and Warren Zevon. She later went on to release a Japanese live album. =Other work= Carter worked as a back-up vocalist for a number of famous recording artists. These included Linda Ronstadt, Don Henley, Christopher Cross, Little Feat, Jackson Browne, the Outlaws and, most notably, James Taylor. Carter wrote the song \\"Cook with Honey\\" which was a hit for Judy Collins on her 1973 album True Stories and Other Dreams. Carter also co-wrote the Jackson Browne track \\"Love Needs a Heart\\" that was featured on his 1977 album Running on Empty. She also worked as a writer for The Brothers Johnson on the track \\"Deceiver\\", and with Earth, Wind & Fire on the track \\"Turn It into Something Good\\", featured on the band's 1980 album Faces. In 1978, she performed the singing voice of the character Jan Mouse in the animated Halloween special \\"The Devil and Daniel Mouse\\" produced by Canadian animation studio Nelvana. She was credited under the pseudonym Laurel Runn, likely inspired by living in Laurel Canyon at the time.https://leonardkirke.wordpress.com/2017/03/10/look-where-the-music-can- take-you/ She sang several songs in the special, including a duet with the songwriter John Sebastian of The Lovin' Spoonful fame. The following year, in 1979, her cover of \\"O-o-h Child\\" was featured in Matt Dillon's film debut in Over the Edge. In 2018 her sister Jan Carter and her friend Kathy Kurasch assembled The Lost Tapes; the first posthumous stand-alone album of previously unreleased material by Valerie Carter. It includes unreleased tracks recorded during her career including \\"I Got Over It\\", co-written by Prince (musician). http://www.princevault.com/index.php?title=Album:_The_Lost_Tapes Her brief collaboration with Prince (musician) was unknown to the public until 2018, the year following Carter's passing. \\"I Got Over It\\" is said to be one of the tracks they both worked on. The other (unknown) songs they did together are announced to be included on future releases by Valerie Carter's estate. Personal life On November 26, 1999, in Montclair, New Jersey, she married Seth Katz, a television executive with Sony. In August and October 2009, Carter was arrested in St. Petersburg, Florida, for possession of drugs. She successfully completed all of the court's requirements, and she became a graduate of Judge Dee Anna Farnell's drug court program on May 25, 2011. American singer-songwriter James Taylor appeared at her drug court graduation ceremonies in a congratulatory effort on behalf of all of the graduates. Carter died of a heart attack on March 4, 2017, at the age of 64. She is survived by her mother, Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Carter, and sister, Jan Carter, who continues the Official Valerie Carter Fan Club as an active Facebook group. The song \\"Valerie\\" recorded by Steve Winwood was reportedly about her, as was Jackson Browne's song \\"That Girl Could Sing\\".

A distinctly American utility vehicle, the buckboard has no springs between the body and the axles. https://www.hansenwheel.com/custom-showcase/custom-vehicle- showcase/buckboardThe suspension is provided by the flexible floorboards of the body and a leaf spring under the seat(s). The buckboard has no sideboards on the body, leaving the floor quite mobile. In rough terrain, the floor can flex and \\"buck\\", lending the vehicle its name. The buckboard is steered by its front wheels, which are connected by a single axle. The front and rear axle are connected by a platform of one or more boards to which the front axle is connected on a pivoting joint at its midpoint. A buckboard wagon often carries a seat for a driver. Such a seat may be supported by springs. The main platform between axles is not suspended by springs like a carriage. Invention The buckboard was invented by Rev. Cyrus Comstock, a traveling preacher living in Lewis, Essex County, New York who established many churches in the surrounding area during the early 1800s. Originally designed for personal transportation in the Adirondack Mountains, these distinctively American vehicles were widely used in newly settled regions of the United States. Extended meanings In the early 20th century, as horse-drawn vehicles were supplanted by the motor car, the term 'buckboard' was also used in reference to a passenger car (usually a 'tourer') from which the rear body had been removed and replaced with a load-carrying bed. These home-built dual- purpose passenger- and load-carrying vehicles were the precursors of the factory-built 'utility' or 'pickup truck'. A further \\"buckboard\\" example are Cyclecars, such as the Smith Flyer, that were also referred to as 'Buckboard Cars'.

Closely related to the northern pike, it reaches a length of , a weight of , sporting a silvery body with small, black spots. Like other pike, this species is prized for sport fishing. It is not commonly found outside its native range. However, it was introduced to Glendale Lake, Cambria County, Pennsylvania (United States), by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) in 1968. The lake is just south of the native range of the northern pike. Pure Amur pike were last spawned in 1971. All of the Pennsylvania Fish Commission's brood stock was lost in the summer of 1976. That same year the world record Amur pike was caught from the lake. The year after, the PFBC also stocked 168 northern pike x Amur pike hybrids into the lake. With a lack of success, the Amur pike program was cancelled. Glendale Lake was chosen because its outflow leads into heavily polluted waters in which fish cannot survive. Pure northern pike are found in the lake today, however it is likely no pure or hybrid Amur pike remain. Some Amur pike escaped from the Benner Spring Fish Hatchery where the original eggs and subsequent brood stock were hatched and kept.

Biography  He was born in Cajabamba, Cajamarca, Peru and traveled extensively in Europe (particularly Italy) and North Africa from 1908 to 1913 before enrolling in the National School of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires, Argentina where he studied for five years. In 1922 he married a poet and writer Mar√≠a Wiesse. The couple had two children: Jos√© Rodolfo Sabogal Wiesse (1923-1983) and Rosa Teresa Sabogal Wiesse (1925-1985). Sabogal taught at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes, Lima (National School of Fine Arts, Lima) from 1920 onward. He served as its director from 1932 to 1943. Afterward Sabogal and Luis E. Valc√°rel cofounded the Instituto Libre de Arte Peruano (Free Institute of Peruvian Arts) at the Museo Nacional de la Cultura Peruana (National Museum of Peruvian Culture). His granddaughter, Isabel Sabogal (born 1958), is a bilingual (Spanish-Polish) novelist, poet, translator and astrologer. Indigenism Although Sabogal's own descent was Spanish rather than indigenous, he promoted pre-Columbian culture and esthetics. A six month stay in Cuzco prompted his indigenism; he took an interest in depicting the city and its inhabitants. In 1919 his Cuzco paintings attracted attention at an exhibition in Lima. As Jane Turner explains, \\"in 1919 was the first exhibition of the work of JOS√â SABOGAL at the Casa Brandes in Lima, an event that would be immensely influential on the future...\\"Jane Turner, The dictionary of art, v. 24 (Grove's Dictionaries, 1996), 509. Sabogal decided to promote Peruvian art to international audiences after a 1922 visit to Mexico where he met Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. These efforts were so successful that in \\"the field of the visual arts, the most striking phenomenon of the 1920s was the rise of Jos√© Sabogal (1888-1956), founder and long-time leader of the so- called 'Peruvian School' of painting.\\"Institute for the Study of Ideologies and Literature, Instituto de Cine y Radio-Televisi√≥n, I & L, Ideologies & literature v. 3, nos. 11-14 (Institute for the Study of Ideologies and Literature., 1980), 76.

This city is a producer of agricultural products including soybeans and beans. A statue of Jesus Christ in Luzi√¢nia. Location Luzi√¢nia is located 68 km south of Bras√≠lia and is part of the area, called Entorno do Distrito Federal. Although the city has existed as a settlement since colonial days, its rapid growth occurred in the eighties and nineties with the population explosion of the federal capital and the need for less expensive living areas outside the planned city. The municipality is limited in the north by Valpara√≠so de Goi√°s and Novo Gama; in the south by Orizona and Ipameri; in the west by Santo Ant√¥nio do Descoberto, Alex√¢nia, and Silv√¢nia; and in the east by Cristalina. Demographic data In 2007 population density was 49.49 inhabitants/km2. The population has almost doubled since 1980, when it was 92,817. Today it is over 190,000 with fewer than 20,000 living in the rural area. (IBGE/Sepin) In 1996 the population had grown to 246,000, but then the city lost much of its territory and population due to the formation of new municipalities like Valpara√≠so de Goi√°s and Cidade Ocidental. Since 1996 the population has continued to grow, showing an increase of 4.81% from 2000 to 2007. (IBGE/Sepin) The economy Until the eighties Luzi√¢nia was a sleepy little agricultural town a half hour's drive away from Bras√≠lia. Then agribusiness discovered the relatively flat lands that could produce high yields of soybeans with central pivot irrigation. Today the city is one of the most prosperous in the state and the second largest producer of beans and potatoes in the state, and the third largest producer of cotton and corn. In fruit cultivation it is the first producer in the state of guava and the fourth of tomatoes and passion fruit (maracuj√°). Planted area of the main crops in 2006 was: cotton, 1,334 hectares; rice, 1,000 hectares; beans, 24,000 hectares; corn, 15,000 hectares; and soybeans, 40,000 hectares. The economy is also strong in cattle raising (187,000 head in 2006), both for meat and dairy, as well as semi-precious stones, gravel, bricks, and a well-known sweet made from quince. Due to the proximity to Bras√≠lia there is extensive production of fruits and garden vegetables. The poultry industry is highly developed with 1,227,000 birds in 2006.

As an eminent poet, she was composer of quatrains (ruba'is). Biography Originated from Ganja, she was said to have associated with both Omar Khayyam and Nizami. She is also said to have been a companion of Sultan Sanjar.

Her purported love affairs are recounted in the works of Jauhari of Bukhara. No details about her life are documented except that she was born in Ganja and was highly esteemed at the court of Sultan Sanjar of the Seljuk dynasty. She is said to have attracted the notice and gained the favor of Sanjar by the following verse, which she extemporized one evening when the King, on going out from his audience-hall to mount his horse, found that a sudden fall of snow had covered the ground: It is also known that Mahsati was persecuted for her courageous poetry condemning religious obscurantism, fanaticism, and dogmas. Her only works that have come down to us are philosophical and love quatrains (rubaiyat), glorifying the joy of living and the fullness of love. The most complete collection of her quatrains are founded in the Nozhat al-Majales. Approximately 60 quatrains of her are found in the Nozhat al-Majales.Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"NOZHAT AL-MAJƒÄLES\\", Mohammad- Amin Riahi A monument to her was placed in Ganja in 1980.

It can leave the affected person completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. It typically results from a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Signs and symptoms Eye floaters and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye (uveitis) with pain and sensitivity of the eyes to light. The affected eye often remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea, where characteristic focal infiltrates in the choroid named Dal√©n‚ÄìFuchs nodules can be seen. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved, although perivascular cuffing of the retinal vessels with inflammatory cells may occur. Swelling of the optic disc (papilledema), secondary glaucoma, vitiligo, and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. Pathophysiology Sympathetic ophthalmia is currently thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. The immune system, which normally is not exposed to ocular proteins, is introduced to the contents of the eye following traumatic injury.A cautionary tale from the past, by K. Barry Sharpless, in MIT Tech Talk; published March 19, 1992; retrieved May 10, 2016 Once exposed, it senses these antigens as foreign, and begins attacking them. The onset of this process can be from days to years after the inciting traumatic event. Diagnosis Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An important differential diagnosis is Vogt‚ÄìKoyanagi‚ÄìHarada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Still experimental, skin tests with soluble extracts of human or bovine uveal tissue are said to elicit delayed hypersensitivity responses in these patients. Additionally, circulating antibodies to uveal antigens have been found in patients with SO and VKH, as well as those with long-standing uveitis, making this a less than specific assay for SO and VKH. Treatment Because SO is so rarely encountered following eye injury, even when the injured eye is retained, the first choice of treatment may not be enucleation or evisceration, especially if there is a chance that the injured eye may regain some function. Additionally, with current advanced surgical techniques, many eyes once considered nonviable now have a fair prognosis. However, only if the injured eye has completely lost its vision and has no potential for any visual recovery, prevention of SO is done by enucleation of the injured eye preferably within the first 2 weeks of injury. Evisceration‚Äîthe removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact‚Äîis easier to perform, offers long- term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing, i.e., a greater measure of movement of the prosthesis and thus a more natural appearance. There is concern, however, that evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Several retrospective studies involving over 3000 eviscerations, however, have failed to identify a single case of SO. Once SO is developed, immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis. Mild cases may be treated with local application of corticosteroids and pupillary dilators. More severe or progressive cases require high-dose systemic corticosteroids for months to years. Patients who become resistant to corticosteroids or develop side effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy (osteoporosis and pathologic fractures, mental status changes, etc.), may be candidates for therapy with chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, or ciclosporin. Epidemiology Sympathetic ophthalmia is rare, affecting 0.2% to 0.5% of non-surgical eye wounds, and less than 0.01% of surgical penetrating eye wounds. There are no gender or racial differences in incidence of SO. History Although descriptions of sympathetic ophthalmia can be found in ancient Greek texts, modern understanding of SO derives from the works of Scotland's William MacKenzie who characterized and named the disease sympathetic ophthalmitis. At MacKenzie's time, oral mercury and leeches applied to the conjunctiva were the treatments of choice for SO. It is thought that Louis Braille, who injured one of his eyes as a child, lost vision in his other eye owing to SO. James Thurber's adult blindness was also diagnosed as sympathetic ophthalmia deriving from the loss of an eye when he was six years old.

It was founded in 1934, and in 1936 it became an affiliate of the newly formed Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). The SNTMMSSRM¬¥s leaders were initially staunch allies of Vicente Lombardo Toledano, the head of the CTM. In 1949, when Lombardo Toledano left the CTM to form the rival General Union of Workers and Campesinos (UGOCM) and the Popular Party, the SNTMMSRM joined these new organizations. The unions of railroad workers (STFRM) and oil workers (STPRM) also supported Lombardo Toledano. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the CTM saw Lombardo Toledano and these unions as a threat, and in the 1950 the government installed charros (corrupt labor bosses) in the leadership of the SNTMMSSRM. The most important of these charros was Napole√≥n G√≥mez Sada, who was the president of the SNTMMSSRM for decades until he was replaced by his son in 2001. The pro-government SNTMMSSRM leaders faced little opposition from the miners' locals (except for Local 65 in Cananea, Sonora). However, a strong reform campaign was initiated in the 1970s and 1980s by steelworkers' locals. The current leader of the SNTMMSSRM is Napole√≥n G√≥mez Urrutia, son of the long-time union president. G√≥mez Urrutia is today living in exile in Canada, where he fled after being accused of fraud by Mexican authorities. Deemed innocent by his supporters and re-elected to a six-year term in May 2008, G√≥mez Urrutia has organized the union remotely from Vancouver, British Columbia, since 2006.\\"Riley, Anne. \\"Mexico seeks extradition of Gomez from Canada.\\" American Metal Market.

Nine Pound hammer was one of the first rural hardcore punk bands to substantially incorporate rural blue collar motifs into the minimalistic hardcore sound. Their lyrics (suggestive of outlaw country) featured themes such as alcoholism, rural poverty, and violence, and included references and homages to the likes of Jesco White and Dale Earnhardt. In contrast, most of the urban, experimental cowpunk bands of 1970s/80s Los Angeles and the UK were roots rock, folk rock or New Wave bands incorporating country music instruments and influences as a secondary (sometimes temporary) aspect of their sound. Following the breakup of the band in 1997, guitarist Blaine Cartwright formed the band Nashville Pussy, which shares many of Nine Pound Hammer's musical and lyrical conventions with the addition of a lead guitarist and a more hard rock/Southern rock-focused format. History Yuppie Mop Dogs at Ross Theater, Evansville, August 1985 Nine Pound Hammer first played at The Ross Theater, opening for the Xtian rap group, The Disciples Of Decadence, in nearby Evansville, Indiana, with drummer Toby Myrig, David Epperson, and bassist Brian (Forrest) Payne, in 1984. David and Brian left, and Bart Altman, thunderstick man from The Disciples Of Decadence, joined on bass. This lineup played a single show at the Ross Theater as The Yuppie Mop Dogs on August 31, 1985. The band played locally in Owensboro, Kentucky and Evansville, Indiana, garnering a very loyal following before relocating to Lexington, Kentucky as the Raw Recruits. The band then changed their name to The Black Sheep and became the house band at Great Scott's Depot. Darren Howard replaced Toby, and the band became Nine Pound Hammer again. The name of the band is taken from the Merle Travis song Nine Pound Hammer. Brian Moore (Active Ingredients) and Rob Hulsman (Tarbox Ramblers) joined on bass and drums in 1988, just before recording the band's first LP, The Mud, The Blood, and The Beers. The band has six full-length albums and several EPs. In 2005, Nine Pound Hammer was asked to pen a theme song and lyrics for 12 oz. Mouse, a new Adult Swim animated series showing on America's Cartoon Network. Singer Scott Luallen also appears in the series as the voice actor for the character Roostre.

The Casa Monica Hotel is one of the oldest hotels in the United States and is a member of the Historic Hotels of America in the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History The Casa Monica Hotel, renamed the Cordova Hotel by Flagler in 1889, c. 1891 The hotel was opened in 1888 by Franklin W. Smith, a notable Victorian architecture enthusiast and social reformer who earned a place in Florida history for interesting Henry Flagler in investing in the state. The construction material was poured concrete, of which Franklin Smith was a leading experimenter. The original exterior finish was natural, leaving horizontal pour marks visible, and matching other grand Flagler era structures in downtown St. Augustine. Unfortunately, the exterior was altered by covering with a modern material (stucco) in the 1960s. The architectural style was Moorish Revival and Spanish Baroque Revival, in which Smith was also a pioneer promoter. His own winter home, Villa Zorayda, just a block to the west, was the first Moorish Revival building in the Ancient City. The hotel's Sun Parlor was the most notable interior room, but it was gutted after the hotel closed. Its details were unfortunately later demolished and have yet to be restored. Soon after completing the hotel, Smith ran into financial difficulties and sold the hotel, including all fixtures, furnishings, linen, and all other chattel, for $325,000-USD to oil and railroad tycoon Henry Flagler. Upon purchasing the hotel, Henry Flagler renamed the Casa Monica the Cordova Hotel. Flagler, a founder, with John D. Rockefeller, of the Standard Oil Company, already owned two hotels in St. Augustine, the Ponce de Leon Hotel (now Flagler College) and the Hotel Alcazar (now City Hall and the Lightner Museum). From 1888 to 1902, the hotel featured parties, balls, fairs and charity events. The famous travel agency \\"Ask Mr. Foster\\" had its headquarters in the hotel. It was started by Ward G. Foster of St. Augustine, became a national business, and was owned for a time in the 20th century by Peter Ueberroth, one time Commissioner of Baseball. The building once featured an historic marker as the birthplace of the agency, but it has been removed in recent years. In 1902, a short bridge was constructed over Cordova Street that connected the second floors of the Cordova Hotel and the Hotel Alcazar. At the completion of the bridge, the Cordova Hotel was again renamed, this time to Alcazar Annex. In 1903, the Alcazar and Alcazar Annex were considered one hotel and advertised as \\"enlarged and redecorated\\". In 1932, the conjoined parts of the hotel were closed due to the Great Depression. In 1945, the bridge between the Annex portion and the Alcazar Hotel was removed. Entrance to the Casa Monica Hotel Late 20th century In February 1962, St. Johns County Commission voted to purchase the former Casa Monica Hotel for $250,000 USD for use as the St. Johns County Courthouse. In 1964 the lobby of the then- vacant hotel was used to house police dogs that were used against civil rights demonstrators during St. Augustine's greatest modern historic event: the mass campaign led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Dr. Robert Hayling that led directly to the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. Dr. King went on to receive the Nobel Peace Prize a few months later. The renovation took over 6 years to complete. It was finally dedicated as a courthouse in May 1968, and filled that role until the 1990s, housing government offices and archives as well as courtrooms. A notable feature of the courthouse were murals by the artist Hugo Ohlms, whose distinctive work was also featured in the nearby Catholic Cathedral and at the Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge (another civil rights landmark, where the arrest of Mrs. Peabody, the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, while trying to be served in a racially integrated group, made national headlines in 1964). The Ohlms murals were removed when the courthouse was remodeled into its second incarnation as a hotel. Also removed were the stained glass scales of justice that had been in the quatrefoil window over the main door. Renovation In February 1997, Richard Kessler, who had previously been involved with the Days Inn chain, was setting up his own Kessler Collection of lodgings. He purchased the building from St. Johns County for $1.2 million and began to remodel the building to once again become a hotel. The county Tax Collector's office and Property Appraiser's office were given until 1998 to relocate, so workers had to avoid a section of the building for several months.Treen, Dana: \\"Tax breaks may help in hotel restoration\\" Florida Times-Union, November 12, 1997 The renovation was completed in less than 2 years and opened in December 1999 under the original name of the \\"Casa Monica Hotel\\" (the name came from Saint Monica, the North African mother of St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, for whom the Ancient City is named). Richard Kessler and architect Howard W. Davis decided to keep the historic Moorish Revival style of the hotel. Tina Guarano Davis painted the Moorish-style woodwork in the hotel lobby. The Casa Monica sign on the Cordova Street side of the hotel covers over an earlier sign for the St. Johns County Courthouse. State historic preservation officials told them to preserve the courthouse sign, so they covered it over rather than removing it. The huge flagpole on top of the hotel is actually a lightning rod. Present day The hotel at night Today the Casa Monica Hotel operates as part of the Kessler Collection headquartered in Orlando, Florida and is the only hotel in St. Augustine to be given AAA's Four-Diamond award and is a member of the Preferred Hotels organization. =Notable guests= Among the notable guests and speakers in the hotel since it reopened have been Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South African Nobel Peace Prize winner and anti-apartheid crusader, and Rev. C. T. Vivian, civil rights leader and co-worker with Martin Luther King Jr. in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, as well as the King and Queen of Spain during their lightning 2001 visit to St. Augustine. There was a brief stir in 2004 when it was reported that former Beatle Ringo Starr was staying at the hotel and playing at local nightclubs and bars, but the man proved to be an imposter.

The 100th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 28, 1994. In the episode, Superintendent Chalmers fires Principal Skinner after a disaster at the school. Bart, feeling partially responsible for Skinner's firing, tries to help his old principal get his job back. The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Bob Anderson. It was selected for release in a 1999 video collection of selected episodes called The Simpsons: Greatest Hits. The episode features cultural references to films such as Alien and Full Metal Jacket and the television series \\"The Wonder Years\\". The title is a parody of the film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. Since airing, the episode has received a positive critical reception from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.7, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot After dismissing the idea of taking Simpson family home videos and a geode, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to school for show and tell. Bart's show-and-tell presentation is well received by the class, but the dog escapes into the air ducts and is spotted by Ralph. Principal Skinner sends Groundskeeper Willie through a vent to retrieve the dog. Willie catches the dog but becomes trapped in the ducts. As firemen attempt to rescue him, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers arrives. When Willie falls and lands on him, Chalmers fires Skinner, much to Bart's shock. Chalmers hires Ned Flanders as the new principal of Springfield Elementary School. When Flanders is hesitant to use discipline, the children run amok and the school becomes a mad house. Instead of rejoicing at the lack of discipline, Bart feels guilty for getting Skinner fired. He befriends the former principal and shares stories about Flanders' failure as the school's head. Feeling lonely, Skinner decides to re-enlist in the United States Army. To get Skinner his job back, Bart tries to expose Flanders' poor leadership to Chalmers. Despite the chaos at the school, Chalmers is unconcerned because he always disliked Skinner. After hearing Flanders utter a brief mention of God during school announcements, Chalmers fires him for reciting a school prayer and re-hires Skinner as principal. Bart and Skinner share a friendly chat about their typically antagonistic relationship and affectionately hug each other. During their hug, Bart tapes a \\"Kick Me\\" sign on Skinner's back; Skinner tapes a \\"Teach Me\\" sign on Bart. The two chuckle to themselves as they walk away. Production alt=A portrait of a man with black hair looking at the viewer \\"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song\\" was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Bob Anderson. Oakley and Weinstein decided to do a Skinner and Bart episode because the staff wanted to take a diversion from the relatively wacky, fast-paced episodes that had comprised Season 5 so far and, according to show runner David Mirkin, \\"slow down parts of the show to take time for more emotional episodes like this one\\". Much of Principal Skinner's behavior in the episode is based on teachers Oakley and Weinstein had in high school who, according to Oakley, were \\"sad, lonely guys who lived with their mothers\\". It was selected to air as the 100th episode of the show because the staff wanted that particular episode to focus on Bart. Baby Gerald, Luigi Risotto, Assistant Superintendent Leopold, and Flanders' parents make their first appearances on the show in this episode. Leopold and Luigi were designed by David Silverman, one of the show's directors. Anderson thought Luigi was one of the funniest characters on the show when he first read Luigi's lines in the script during a table read of the episode. When Anderson skimmed through the script and saw Luigi's lines, he said he \\"frightened Julie Kavner because I was laughing to myself, but trying to keep the laughter in because it was so damn funny.\\" \\"Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 28, 1994.

The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received a positive critical reception from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, \\"The 100th episode [...] is a fine one, with Principal Skinner's idea for a novel and the conduct of the staff at the Italian restaurant as highpoints.\\" DVD Movie Guides Colin Jacobson said the opening scene of episode reminded him of when he was in second grade and got a puppy for Christmas. Jacobson said, \\"I still recall the excitement when my mom brought [the dog] into school for the others to see, and the first segment of [the episode] reflects the atmosphere caused by a doggie visit. The rest of the episode gets into Skinner‚Äôs life nicely. Toss in a great Alien reference and the episode offers yet another solid show.\\" Jacobson also said he liked the appearance of Flanders's \\"beatnik father\\". Gary Mullinax of The News Journal called the episode \\"very funny\\" and named it one of his top-ten favorite episodes. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+ grade, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score.

The De Ceremoniis (fully De cerimoniis aulae Byzantinae) is the conventional Latin name for a Greek book of ceremonial protocol at the court of the Byzantine emperors in Constantinople. Its Greek title is often cited as (\\"Explanation of the Order of the Palace\\"), taken from the work's preface, or (\\"On the Order of the Palace\\"). In non-specialist English sources, it tends to be called the Book of Ceremonies of Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (variably spelt), a formula used by writers including David Talbot Rice and the modern English translation. History and Sources It was written or at least commissioned by Emperor Constantine VII (reigned 913-959), probably around 956-959. The compilation of Rep. I 17 (Leipzig, Universit√§tsbibliothek) was partially revised later under Nikephoros II (963-969), perhaps under the supervision of Basil Lekapenos, the imperial parakoimomenos, and it also contains earlier descriptions of the 6th century.\\"De Ceremoniis\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 595. . One of the book's appendices are the Three Treatises on Imperial Military Expeditions, a war manual written by Constantine VII for his son and successor, Romanos II.  Composition  Map of the Great Palace situated between the Hippodrome and the Hagia Sophia. The structures of the Great Palace are shown in their approximate position as derived from literary sources. Surviving structures are in black. In its incomplete form chapters 1-37 of book I describe processions and ceremonies on religious festivals (many lesser ones, but especially great feasts like the Elevation of the Cross, Christmas, Epiphany, Palm Sunday, Good Friday, Easter and Ascension Day and saint's days like St Demetrius, St Basil etc. often extended over many days), while chapters 38-83 describe secular ceremonies or rites of passage like coronations (38-40), weddings (39,41), births (42), funerals (60), or the celebration of war triumphs during feasts at the Hippodrome like Lupercalia (73).For a discussion of the ceremonial book's composition, but also on details of certain ceremonies, see: These protocols gave rules for imperial progresses to and from certain churches at Constantinople and the imperial palace,See also the reconstruction of a three-dimensional model of the quarter, and the presentation of a reconstruction by Jan Kostenec. with fixed stations and rules for ritual actions and acclamations from specified participants (the text of acclamations and processional troparia or kontakia, but also heirmoi and stichera are mentioned), among them also ministers, senate members, leaders of the \\"Blues\\" and the \\"Greens\\" during the hippodrome's horse races who had an important role during court ceremonies.The hippodrome was as important for court ceremonies as the Hagia Sophia for imperial religious ceremonies and rites of passage. It was not only used during horse races, but also for receptions and its banquets and the yearly celebration of Constantinople's inauguration on 11 May. The \\"Golden Hippodrome\\" was an own ceremony to inaugurate a new season and to fix the calendar of the ceremonial located in the hippodrome. Occasionally also votive horse races were given, like on 22 July for the feast of Saint Elias. The following chapters (84-95) are taken from a 6th-century manual by Peter the Patrician. They rather describe administrative ceremonies like the appointment of certain functionaries (ch. 84,85), investitures of certain offices (86), the reception of ambassadors and the proclamation of the Western Emperor (87,88), the reception of Persian ambassadors (89,90), Anagorevseis of certain Emperors (91-96), the appointment of the senate's proedros (97). The \\"palace order\\" prescribes the conveyances required for movement (i.e. on foot, mounted, by boat), as well as the participants‚Äô costumes and acclamations, some of which were debased Latin, which had not been an administrative language for more than three centuries.Byzantine Civilisation, Steven Runciman, Hodder & Stoughton Educational (1933) (page 232) The second book follows a very similar composition: (1) religious feasts and the description of palace buildings, (2) secular ceremonies and imperial ordonations, (3) imperial receptions and war festivities at the hippodrome, and later customs instituted by Constantine and his son Romanos.

A column of 1,750 English troops led by Henry Bagenal was ambushed near Clontibret by a larger Gaelic Irish army led by Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. The English column had been sent to relieve the besieged English garrison at Monaghan Castle. The English suffered very heavy losses, but a suicidal cavalry charge apparently saved it from destruction. The Irish victory shocked the English and was their first severe setback during the war. Background The Nine Years' War began as Irish lords in Ulster responded to the encroachment of English authority on the Irish nobility's traditional rights and privileges. The breaking of the MacMahon lordship in Monaghan by the English Lord Deputy William Fitzwilliam, his willingness to allow English lords to enrich themselves at the expense of Irish lords and the military incursions into Hugh Maguire's lordship in Fermanagh all served to convince the Irish that their patrimonies were under threat.O'Neill, Nine Years War, pp 23-4 Hugh O'Neill of Tyrone engaged in a proxy war from April 1593 to the beginning of 1595 using Hugh Maguire and Hugh Roe O'Donnell to fight the English while he reinforced his position in Ulster. However, Tyrone broke out into open warfare against the English in February 1595 when he attacked and captured the Blackwater Fort on the border of Counties Tyrone and Armagh.O'Neill, 'Death in the lakelands: Tyrone's proxy war, 1593-4', History Ireland, vol. 23, no. 2 (2015), pp 14-17. O'Neill promptly besieged the English garrison at Monaghan Castle, and Sir Henry Bagenal, commander of the English forces, marched out to its relief on 25 May (4 June New Style) from Dundalk via Newry. His army was made up of 1,750 troops, including some veterans and certain companies newly arrived from the Spanish campaign in Brittany, but there were many new recruits in the ranks. Bagenal's men were mostly infantry, armed with muskets and pikes; there was also a small number of horsemen raised in the Pale. The English in Dublin did not take the threat from Tyrone's men seriously, although some thought the ammunition and gunpowder supplied to the English was insufficient. When one of the Brittany captains questioned this he was told by Lord Deputy that he had nothing to worry about as this was Ireland and not the Low Countries; the large number of troops was to \\"give countenance to the service\\".Sir James Perrot, The chronicle of Ireland 1584-1608, ed. Herbert Wood (Dublin, 1933), p. 94 The battle The Battle of Clontibret was essentially a two-day running battle, as Bagenal's column was ambushed on its way to and from the castle at Monaghan town. On its way to Monaghan, the English column was ambushed at Crossdall, about 4 miles (6.5 km) from the town. The English column, as described by Captain Francis Stafford, was engaged at \\"a place of very great disadvantage for us which he [O'Neill] knew we would pass named Crosdawlye\\".Captain Francis Stafford to Sir Geffrey Fenton, 4 June 1595 (T.N.A., SP 63/180, f. 66) Tyrone sent 700-800 Irish troops armed with muskets and calivers (together known as 'shot') to contest the pass, but he was careful to ensure they were \\"continually seconded from their battle\\".Report by Lieutenant Tucher [Perkins], 1 June 1595 (Cal. Carew MSS, 1589-1600, pp 109-110). There was no single English officer in charge, therefore Captain Richard Cuney drew out 150 men to hold back the Irish and enable the rest of the English army to pass.Sir James Perrot, The chronicle of Ireland 1584-1608, ed. Herbert Wood (Dublin, 1933), pp 94-5 Cuney skirmished for perhaps four hours, then rejoined the column as the rear passed through to Monaghan. The action cost the English 12 killed and 30 wounded.Report by Lieutenant Tucher [Perkins], 1 June 1595 (Cal. Carew MSS, 1589-1600, pp 109-110). Marker stone at the site of the Battle of Clontibret As Bagenal's army neared Monaghan, the Irish besieging the town withdrew. The English garrison was re-supplied and reinforced with one company. Bagenal had misgivings about his supply of gunpowder and lead, much of which had been spent on the way, and could afford little for the garrison before he started back. The following day, 27 May, Bagenal set out for Newry in a column, but by another route past the townland of Clontibret and through drumlin country, which abounded with hills, bogs, and woods, making it ideal for an ambush. Bagenal claimed this was to protect women and children accompanying the army. Tyrone positioned troops on either side of the new line of march but, fortunately for Bagenal, Tyrone could not bring his full force to bear since an amphibious raid in Tyrconnell by Sir George Bingham had caused Tyrone's closest ally, Hugh Roe O'Donnell, to withdraw to Tyrconnell.O'Neill, The Nine Years War, p. 50 Tyrone's army ‚Äì about 4,000 strong ‚Äì consisted of contingents from the O'Neills, MacMahons and Maguires, as well as Scottish mercenaries. The Irish also deployed a greatly enlarged force of cavalry, musketeers and caliver-men. To Bagenal's puzzlement, the caliver-men wore red coats and fought expertly. Bagenal deployed his men into three bodies - the van, battle, and rear - each with a core of pikemen supported by musketeers and caliver-men. Tyrone had sent his brother, Cormac MacBaron, to occupy high ground at Crossaghy on the English right, and shot were placed in a bog on the English left while Tyrone prepared to attack the rear of the column. The column came under fire from the outset, and then fell into a major ambush at a pass just after the church at Clontibret. The Irish attacked from front, flanks, and rear, with their shot seconded by horsemen and pike, enabling the Irish skirmishers to pour close- range gunfire into the massed English ranks from as little as thirty metres. The English column stalled, and over three hours managed to advance only a quarter-mile.√ì Mear√°in, 'The Battle of Clontibret', p. 18 The close cooperation of the Irish foot and horse shocked English officers as \\"having divided both horse and foot into sundry troops, and every troop of horse led by a troops of shot, wherewith he [Tyrone] would bring them within half- caliver shot of the main stand of our pikes\\".Quoted in √ì Mear√°in, 'The Battle of Clontibret', p. 19 The Irish shot advanced, fired, then retreated to reload before returning to continue firing. The English troops began to run short on gunpowder, and as their store of munition ran critically low the English pike were forced to charge, pushing Tyrone's shot back. But the Irish shot moved forward again when the English pike rejoined the column.O'Neill, The Nine Years War, p. 51 Bagenal's situation grew more desperate and Tyrone moved in, hoping that a final volley would break the English formation. Just as Tyrone seemed about to break Bagenal's units a brave, but suicidal, charge by the English cavalry prevented the collapse of the English position. Led by Cornet Sedgreve, forty horse charged straight at Tyrone. Sir Ralph Lane noted that \\"their encounter was so rude that they were both unhorsed\\".Sir Ralph Lane to Burghley, 9 June 1595 (T.N.A., SP 63/180, f.82) Sedgreve had Tyrone by the neck, but the earl was well-armoured, wearing jack of plate; ironically, this had been given to him by Sir Christopher Hatton, the English Lord Chancellor.Ibid One of Tyrone's officers intervened, cutting off Sedgeve's arm, before Tyrone finished his opponent by thrusting his dagger into Sedgreve's groin. The English cavalry were slaughtered, but Sedgreve's sacrifice had given Bagenal the breathing room he needed to get the column moving. The Irish had blocked all the passages through the bog, but slowly the English pushed on. The veteran troops from Brittany performed well, but many of Bagenal's men were 'new come to the wars'.Hayes-McCoy, Irish Battles, p. 102 However, the fierceness of the fighting had exhausted Tyrone's immediate supply of gunpowder.Report by Lieutenant Tucher [Perkins], 1 June 1595 (Cal. Carew MSS, 1589-1600, pp 109-110) The English column slowed to a crawl, and as night fell Bagenal called his men to a halt and camped at the hilltop of Ballymacowen. It seemed that hundreds were missing, and there was fear that the Irish would renew the attack under cover of darkness. But there was no further attack, and soon after dawn reinforcements from Newry arrived to relieve the column. Aftermath According to intelligence received in the days following, Hugh O'Neill's failure to follow up had been caused by a lack of gunpowder ‚Äì ironic, given the state of Bagenal's own supplies ‚Äì but the overall sense in government was of disquiet, and a bad job was made of hushing up the casualty figures. This fuelled the rumours of a severe defeat, and many people set greater store on the numbers put about by the Irish side. The defeat shocked the English in Dublin, moreso because of the modern and disciplined forces deployed by O'Neill. Lord Deputy Russell wrote \\"Their arms and weapons, their skill and practise therein far exceeding their wonted usage, having not only great force of pikes and muskets, but also many trained and experienced leaders as appeared by the manner of coming to the fight, and their orderly carriage therein\\".O'Neill, The Irish Military Revolution, p. 300 One of the most experienced English officers in Ireland was unambiguous when he wrote \\"The state of the northern rebels is well different from that it is well wont to be; their numbers greater, their arms better, and their munition more plenty with them whereof there can be no greater proof that; there being at this present 1,700 of the best [English] footmen in Ireland at the Newry, and near 300 horse with them they dare not undertake to march thence to Dundalk, which is but eight miles...but they refrain to be sent for by water...a thing never before heard that such a troop should not be able to make their own way in Ireland\\".Quoted in O'Neill, Nine Years War, p. 52. Sir Ralph Lane, the English muster-master-general, informed the Queen's principal secretary, Lord Burghley, that \\"more men were hurt and killed in that late service than was convenient to declare.CSPI, 1592-6, p. 333 The casualty figures for both sides vary depending on sources. Bagenal admitted only 31 killed and 109 wounded on the second day of fighting, but his losses were almost certainly higher. The Irish annals claimed up to 700 English killed. Estimates of the Irish losses vary between 100 and 400 killed. Three years later, Bagenal led an army into another ambush by Tyrone, at the Battle of the Yellow Ford. The English general was killed and his troops were routed with heavy losses.

He has released some 35 albums, including solo albums and with bands such as LSU and Cush.  Background  Knott's music has sometimes been controversial in Christian circles, particularly due to profanity in the song \\"Rocket and a Bomb\\" (from the self-titled release of his former band Aunt Bettys) and original artwork in that album of Jesus Christ as a bartender. Knott's songwriting appealed to many people, particularly Christians who could admit their flaws, and who appreciated the honesty with which he tackled his own shortcomings. Examples include \\"Double,\\" \\"Shaded Pain\\" and the aforementioned \\"Rocket and a Bomb.\\" Knott explained some of his views in an interview with HM Magazine, saying, \\"Basically, I'm a human being and I believe in Christ, period. It doesn't make my life rosy, it doesn't make my life terrible, it doesn't do anything with that. I know Christ.\\" Career highlights include LSU's epic Cornerstone appearance in '93 (band dressed in costumes), Aunt Bettys record-label bidding war and eventual signing with Elektra (1995) and a Jed the Fish \\"Catch of the Day\\" spin on KROQ for the Strung Gurus' \\"Sun-Eyed Girl.\\" Members of Cush and Aunt Bettys joined Knott on stage for a Dennis Danell benefit concert at Verizon Wireless with a line-up that also included Pennywise, Offspring, X and Social Distortion. Aunt Bettys and Mike Knott songs are prominently featured in the 1998 indie film \\"Boogie Boy\\" (Imperial), exec-produced by Grammy-winning \\"Pulp Fiction\\" co-writer Roger Avary. Knott is a painter, frequently signing his works under the name 'Gerard'. His artwork has been used for cover art on many of his own releases as well as releases by The Choir, Charity Empressa, and others. When he began touring again in 2000, Knott began creating painting series that he sold at shows and eventually online. Michael Knott was the founder of the now defunct independent record label, Blonde Vinyl Records, and co-founded Tooth and Nail Records with Brandon Ebel. After ending their contract with Elektra, Aunt Bettys released their second album Ford Supersonic (originally through Marathon Records). The band quit by the decade's end, and Knott started Strung Gurus with Social Distortion founding-guitarist Dennis Danell. When Danell died in early 2000, Knott began self-releasing several albums (many of which featured previously unreleased tracks) to coincide with a number of solo acoustic tours. In Sept. 2010, Aunt Betty's Ford (using their original name) reformed for a show at the Detroit Bar in Costa Mesa, their first show together in 13 years. A handful of other shows have followed. Knott's 2010 album, PTSD by L.S. Underground is a concept album dealing with a soldier's posttraumatic stress disorder, a common risk for veterans of war. The band includes Crucified drummer Jim Chaffin. PTSD was given a generally positive review by D.W. Dunphy by Popdose. Dunphy's said, \\"L.S Underground still survives, and while the music isn't for everyone, it is a welcome reminder to his fans that Michael Knott and company are back doing what they do best.\\" On September 7, 2014, Knottheads.com, the Michael Knott tribute site and his former label Blonde Vinyl, announced that a Kickstarter campaign to mark the 20th anniversary of Rocket and a Bomb was live. A concert was planned for November 7, 2014 in Concord, California, in which the Rocket and a Bomb record was performed in its entirety. The full-band performance by Michael Knott was billed to feature special guests Michael Roe and Derri Daugherty, along with a special appearance by Dead Artist Syndrome. The Kickstarter project, which had a goal of $9,000, was fully funded prior to its deadline. On December 29, 2014, Knott had a heart attack which left him recovering from surgery for the first part of 2015. A recording of the 2014 \\"Rocket and a Bomb\\" live performance as well as a new studio EP, Songs From The Feather River Highway, was digitally distributed to Kickstarter backers by May 2016. A release of the EP via Bandcamp followed.

He was memorialized for his prowess in his chosen art by being remembered as one of the outstanding Three Brush Traces (Sanseki ‰∏âË∑°), along with Ono no Michikaze and Fujiwara no Sukemasa. Life Yukinari was the son of a courtier by the name of Fujiwara no Yoshitaka. After the early death of his father, he was raised by his grandfather, Prince Kanenori. Yukinari had a fairly successful career as a court official, where he served as a Major Counselor. Yukinari further improved the Japanese style calligraphy (way≈ç-shod≈ç ÂíåÊßòÊõ∏ÈÅì), and showed great respect to its founder, Ono no Michikaze (894-966). He even mentioned in his diary, Gonki, that he had a dream wherein he met Michikaze and learnt calligraphy from him. Yukinari was known as the master of kana. His style was mild and easily emulated, his lines were dainty and exquisite, resulting in highly elegant characters. Fujiwara Yukinari is regarded as the founder of the Sesonji lineage of calligraphy, which later became the leading tradition of way≈ç (ÂíåÊßò) calligraphy. His extant works were most written in Mana (Chinese characters used as units of meaning) in Gy≈çsho or S≈çsho. Works A part of Bai Juyi's eight poems One of his most well-known works is the handscroll of Bai Juyi's eight poems from volume 65 of his Poetic Anthology. He wrote this masterpiece in 1018 when he was forty-seven years old. The scroll was made by joining together nine pieces of specially prepared paper known as ryoshi, then dyed in light brown, claret, and other shades. This handscroll was treasured by Emperor Fushimi (reigned from 1288 to 1298), and the colophon over the seams on the back of the paper attests to this. Currently, the scroll is stored in the Tokyo National Museum.

It was transmitted from the Pebble Mill studios of BBC Birmingham, and uniquely was hosted from the centre's main foyer area, rather than a conventional television studio. History BBC Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham (1992) Until 1972, broadcasting hours on British television were tightly controlled and limited by the British government. There were restrictions on the number of hours per day which could be used by the BBC and ITV for regular television programming. In the 1960s, it was set at a 50-hour allowance per week (with exemptions for schools programmes, adult education, state occasions, Welsh language programming, and outside broadcasts of sporting events) and gradually increased by the government at regular intervals. In 1972, the government - under Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath - announced its plan to completely lift all restrictions and limits on broadcasting hours, and allow the BBC and ITV to set their own schedules. This was introduced in January of that year. With the lifting of the restrictions, ITV planned to launch a full daytime schedule in the autumn of 1972, with the broadcasting day gradually increasing throughout that year. To counter this, the BBC planned to launch a selection of new programming along with repeats and films, to expand their daytime schedules; now that broadcasting restrictions were gone, they planned to launch a brand new lunchtime magazine series, so to anchor their BBC1 new daytime schedules around this new programme, which became Pebble Mill at One. When this was launched, it was always preceded by the five-minute BBC lunchtime news summary at 12:55pm, which would lead into the programme commencing at 1:00pm. Until 1986, there were few television programmes transmitted on BBC television during daytime hours. For this reason, Pebble Mill at One acquired a unique following from those who found themselves at home at lunchtime. Housewives, students, and those recovering from an illness remember it with fondness for its variety and the problems inherent with live television. The programme was broadcast from the foyer of Pebble Mill, because a planned third studio was never constructed on the site, and existing facilities were fully booked for network drama production and local news. In the beginning, visitors to the studios were seen arriving in the background as the programme was transmitted. Gradually, as the programme became more successful, the foyer became a studio, and visitors had to use a new entrance. Two weeks after Pebble Mill at One began, ITV launched a brand new daytime line-up, including an ITN News bulletin at lunchtime, placing it in direct competition with Pebble Mill at One. Only a handful of editions of Pebble Mill at One are known to survive. However, one that does survive from the early years, celebrated the tenth anniversary of Doctor Who in 1973, featuring interviews with Patrick Troughton and visual effects designer Bernard Wilkie; this is included among the special features of the DVD release of The Three Doctors. Some other Doctor Who-related interviews from Pebble Mill at One have survived due to early domestic video recordings, and have been released on DVDs. =Presenters= Presenters during the long run included Jan Leeming, Donny MacLeod, Fern Britton, Marian Foster, Debi Jones, Bob Langley, Tom Coyne, David Seymour, Magnus Magnusson, Alan Titchmarsh, Chris Baines, Josephine Buchan, Judi Spiers, and Paul Coia. Editors included Terry Dobson, Jim Dumighan, and Peter Hercombe. A regular cookery slot was presented by Rev John Eley, popularly known as the Cooking Canon. =Axing= In 1986, Bill Cotton, Managing Director of Television at the BBC, decided that a full daytime service was required on BBC1. As part of this new service, the decision was taken by BBC1 controller Michael Grade to replace Pebble Mill at One with a new lunchtime news bulletin, the One O'Clock News. Over 30,000 viewers wrote to the BBC to complain. A previous Assistant Editor of the programme, Roger Laughton (later to become a senior executive with the BBC and Meridian Broadcasting) was given responsibility for planning the BBC's new daytime schedule. The Pebble Mill format returned on 21 October 1987 as Daytime Live, renamed Scene Today in October 1990 and finally Pebble Mill in October 1991 though none were broadcast at 1:00pm. Theme music The programme's signature tune was initially \\"As You Please\\", written by easy listening composer Raymond Lef√®vre. It was later changed to \\"Miller's Tune\\" by Patchwork. Spin-offs There were several Pebble Mill spin-offs, particularly in the 1970s, such as the late night chat show Saturday Night at the Mill which began in 1976. Kenny Ball and His Jazzmen were the regular house band, and they performed the signature tune. Until 1978, the spin-off was hosted by Bob Langley and Donny MacLeod, who was replaced by Tony Lewis, and who in turn was replaced in 1980 by Arianna Stassinopoulos, though she was dropped after just five editions. For the remainder of the season, Langley was joined by a different female co-host each week, which included Hayley Mills, Sue Cook, Liza Goddard, Maureen Lipman, Jill Townsend, Jackie Collins and Jenny Hanley, who became the permanent co-host to Langley for the final season broadcast in 1981. In its final year, an early evening version called Six Fifty-Five Special surfaced when Pebble Mill was on its summer break, presented by Sally James, Paul Coia, David Soul and Bob Langley. In 1986, The Clothes Show, presented by Jeff Banks and Selina Scott, was created from a strand produced by Roger Casstles, first shown on Pebble Mill at One. Memorable moments =HMS Ark Royal live broadcast= On 20 September 1979, Pebble Mill at One was visited by a Sea Harrier aircraft from RNAS Yeovilton (aircraft FRS.1 XZ451 of 700A Squadron) flown by Lieutenant Commander Nigel \\"Sharkey\\" Ward, which landed (and later took off) vertically, on the adjacent BBC Social Club's football pitch. The programme returned the favour on 7 April 1986 by transmitting a live programme from the newly launched aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal in the English Channel. This programme, near the end of its life, was produced by Tom Ross and directed by Tony Rayner, and attracted its highest ever audience of nearly six million viewers. =Owen Paul miming incident= One of the more frequently repeated scenes from Pebble Mill at One was in 1986, when Marian Foster introduced pop singer Owen Paul, who was to perform his hit cover of Marshall Crenshaw's \\"My Favourite Waste of Time\\". He was to mime to a backing track, but could not hear the foldback loudspeaker as it had failed, and so was seen standing looking into the camera, while the music played and his recorded voice was heard.

Such sets are commonly stack-based rather than register- based to reduce the size of operand specifiers. Such a stack machine architecture is inherently simpler since all instructions operate on the top- most stack entries. One result of the stack architecture is an overall smaller instruction set, allowing a smaller and faster instruction decode unit with overall faster operation of individual instructions. Separate from the stack definition of a MISC architecture, is the MISC architecture being defined by the number of instructions supported. * Typically a minimal instruction set computer is viewed as having 32 or fewer instructions, where NOP, RESET, and CPUID type instructions are usually not counted by consensus due to their fundamental nature. * 32 instructions is viewed as the highest allowable number of instructions for a MISC, though 16 or 8 instructions are closer to what is meant by \\"Minimal Instructions\\". * A MISC CPU cannot have zero instructions as that is a zero instruction set computer. * A MISC CPU cannot have one instruction as that is a one instruction set computer Kong, J.H.; Ang, L.-M.; Seng, K.P. \\"Minimal Instruction Set AES Processor using Harvard Architecture\\". 2010\\\\. * The implemented CPU instructions should by default not support a wide set of inputs, so this typically means an 8-bit or 16-bit CPU. * If a CPU has an NX bit, it is more likely to be viewed as being a complex instruction set computer (CISC) or reduced instruction set computer (RISC). * MISC chips typically lack hardware memory protection of any kind, unless there is an application specific reason to have the feature. * If a CPU has a microcode subsystem, that excludes it from being a MISC. * The only addressing mode considered acceptable for a MISC CPU to have is load/store, the same as for reduced instruction set computer (RISC) CPUs. * MISC CPUs can typically have between 64 KB to 4 GB of accessible addressable memory‚Äîbut most MISC designs are under 1 megabyte. Also, the instruction pipelines of MISC as a rule tend to be very simple. Instruction pipelines, branch prediction, out- of-order execution, register renaming, and speculative execution broadly exclude a CPU from being classified as a MISC architecture. History Some of the first digital computers implemented with instruction sets were by modern definition minimal instruction set computers. Among these various computers, only ILLIAC and ORDVAC had compatible instruction sets. * Manchester Baby (University of Manchester, England) made its first successful run of a stored program on June 21, 1948. * Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC, University of Cambridge, England) was the first practical stored-program electronic computer (May 1949) * Manchester Mark 1 (Victoria University of Manchester, England) Developed from the Baby (June 1949) * Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer (CSIRAC, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) Australia (November 1949) * Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC, Ballistic Research Laboratory, Computing Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground 1951) * Ordnance Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (ORDVAC, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland (completed November 1951) * IAS machine at Princeton University (January 1952) * MANIAC I at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (March 1952) * Illinois Automatic Computer (ILLIAC) at the University of Illinois, (September 1952) =Early stored- program computers= * The IBM SSEC had the ability to treat instructions as data, and was publicly demonstrated on January 27, 1948. This ability was claimed in a US patent issued April 28, 1953. However, it was partly electromechanical, not fully electronic. In practice, instructions were read from paper tape due to its limited memory. * The Manchester Baby, by the Victoria University of Manchester, was the first fully electronic computer to run a stored program. It ran a factoring program for 52 minutes on June 21, 1948, after running a simple division program and a program to show that two numbers were relatively prime. * The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was modified to run as a primitive read-only stored-program computer (using the Function Tables for program read-only memory (ROM) and was demonstrated as such on September 16, 1948, running a program by Adele Goldstine for von Neumann. * The Binary Automatic Computer (BINAC) ran some test programs in February, March, and April 1949, although was not completed until September 1949. * The Manchester Mark 1 developed from the Baby project. An intermediate version of the Mark 1 was available to run programs in April 1949, but was not completed until October 1949. * The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) ran its first program on May 6, 1949. * The Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC) was delivered in August 1949, but it had problems that kept it from being put into regular operation until 1951. * The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer (CSIRAC, formerly CSIR Mk I) ran its first program in November 1949. * The Standards Eastern Automatic Computer (SEAC) was demonstrated in April 1950. * The Pilot ACE ran its first program on May 10, 1950 and was demonstrated in December 1950. * The Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC) was completed in July 1950. * The Whirlwind was completed in December 1950 and was in actual use in April 1951. * The first ERA Atlas (later the commercial ERA 1101/UNIVAC 1101) was installed in December 1950. Design weaknesses The disadvantage of a MISC is that instructions tend to have more sequential dependencies, reducing overall instruction-level parallelism. MISC architectures have much in common with some features of some programming languages such as Forth's use of the stack, and the Java virtual machine. Both are weak in providing full instruction-level parallelism. Notable CPUs Probably the most commercially successful MISC was the original INMOS transputer architecture that had no floating-point unit. However, many 8-bit microcontrollers, for embedded computer applications, qualify as MISC. Each STEREO spacecraft includes two P24 MISC CPUs and two CPU24 MISC CPUs.

It was notable for its use of the Raytheon/Lockheed-Martin Javelin anti- tank missile. The weapon demonstrated how lethal and crucial technology can be in determining the outcome of a battle. The light unarmored SOF and Peshmerga (KDP) force faced a mechanized force of Iraqi infantry and tanks. The numerically inferior US and KPD force was able to defeat the Iraqi mechanized infantry & tank force with combined air-to-ground strikes, superior maneuvering, and the use of the Javelin missiles. Objective The 26 United States Army Special Forces Green Berets were divided into two A-teams; ODA 391 and ODA 392, from the 3rd SFG,Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.102 were equipped with GMVs (Ground Mobility Vehicles)-modified Humvees with 50 caliber HMGs and Mark 19 Grenade launchers that could travel a thousand miles without resupply. the ODAs conducted battle training in Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Fort Pickett, Virginia between October and December 2002, On March 8 2003, the ODAs flew from Pope Air Force Base to Romania and on 26 March 2003 they infiltrated northern Iraq via a MC-130 Combat Talon landing at Al-Sulaymaniya, some 60 miles east of Kirkuk. In their first few days in Iraq they participated in Operation Viking Hammer and then on April 1 2003, they moved to Irbil and onto a staging area where they linked up with ODA 044, 10th SFG and their Peshmerga allies. On April 4 2003, they were given a new mission, code-named Northern Safari.Cawthorne, Nigel, The Mammoth Book of Inside the Elite Forces, Robinson, 2008 On 6 April 2003, the 26 Green Berets were given the task to capture a strategically important junction between Mosul and Kirkuk, near the village of Debecka (Dibege, ÿØ€åÿ®Ÿá‚Äå⁄ØŸá in Kurdish). Were it captured, it would sever Highway 2 and impede Iraqi movement in the north, as well as provide a springboard to eventually drive on and capture the important Kirkuk oil fields. They were to seize the Debecka intersection until relieved by the 173rd Airborne Brigade's artillery component.Cawthorne, Nigel, The Mammoth Book of Inside the Elite Forces, Robinson, 2008 The battle On the eighteenth day of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the US Special Forces moved in for the attack. The battle began with an aerial bombardment from B-52 bombers. Green Berets from ODA 044 with 150 Peshmerga fighters advanced towards Objective Rock - a T junction leading to the crossroads and to the town of Debecka. ODA 391 and 392 would provide fire support for supported ODA 044 and the Peshmerga, to their immediate north two groups of 500 Peshmerga fighters advanced on the ridgeline; further North, ODA 043, with 150 Kurds, supported by ODAs 394 and 395 acting as fire support attacked Objective Stone - a commanding hilltop occupied by Iraqi forces. Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.102 The central column of 500 Peshmerga reached the ridgeline; only running into token resistance, they seized their sector of the ridgeline. ODAs 394 and 395 began suppressing the defenders of Objective Stone, after a scheduled airstrike failed to soften up the Iraqi defences, causing the Peshmerga to initially refuse to attack the objective, the two ODAs were engaged by Iraqi heavy machine guns and 120mm mortar fire. The ODAs managed to call in additional CAS which covered the withdrawal of the fire support ODAs out of mortar range and finally suppressed the majority of Objective Stone's defenders, ODAs 394 and 395 quickly resupplied on ammunition and returned to the battle. However, the ODAs were not in place when ODA 043 convinced the Peshmerga to advance again, but the Peshmerga advanced captured the hilltop objective.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.103 To the South, ODAs 044, 391 and 392 ran into dirt berms that the Iraqis had built across the road leading to Objective Rock, scattering mines over the roadway, whilst the Peshmerga attempted to clear the mines, the ODAs bypassed the roadblock. As the teams crested the ridge they engaged Iraqi infantry in prepared positions and bunkers who soon surrendered under the firepower of the GMVs; an Iraqi Colonel who was taken prisoner said that an Iraqi Army armoured unit that was supporting them had withdrawn south. The ODAs returned to breach the dirt berm on the road behind them with demolition charges in case of a hasty retreat was required and moved up onto a small hill known as Press Hill, obscuring an approach to the crossroads from the south. The ODAs then advanced down to the Debecka crossroads themselves, at the edge of Debecka, ODA 392 pursued several Iraqi light mortar teams until it was engaged at long range by ZSU-57-2, whilst ODA 391 destroyed several trucks and armed technicals from Debecka with its Javelin anti-tank missiles and .50 caliber heavy machine guns. Soon after, the ODAs spotted a number of Iraqi MTLB tracked armored personnel carriers appear out of the haze - advancing cautiously toward the crossroads and using their smoke generators to lay down a smoke screen behind them. The Green Berets attempted to suppress and halt them with .50 caliber machine gun and MK19 grenade launchers, they needed to buy themselves time to call in airstrikes and to cool down the Command Launch Units of their Javelins. At that moment, four Iraqi T-55 tanks appeared from behind the MTLBs, firing their 100mm guns directly at the Green Berets, the ODAs mounted their GMVs and pulled back to a ridgeline some 900m from the crossroads which they dubbed their \\"Alamo\\", the Green Berets continued to ask for air support only to be told it would take a further 30 minutes to arrive on-station. The ODAs Javelin units were finally ready and began destroying the MTLBs, however they soon running low having only brought a few spare missiles, but the sudden onslaught of missiles temporarily halted the Iraqi attack. The T-55s used a dirt berm to approach the crossroads slowly, effectively shielding them from the \\"lock on\\" of a Javelin; finally - some 35 minutes after the initial request was made two U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcats arrived. Despite being directed onto the T-55s, the first 2,000lb bomb landed among friendly forces, including a Green Beret AOB (Advanced Operational Base) at Objective Rock, the F-14 pilot got confused and targeted an old rusting hulk of a similar T-55 at Objective Rock rather than the four engaging the ODAs. The bomb killed 18 Peshmerga and wounded 45 along with 4 AOB Green Berets and a BBC camera crew accompanying the Peshmerga (one of them was BBC journalist John Simpson), half of ODA 391 immediately drove to the scene and began treating casualties. The rest of the Green Berets were forced to pull back from the \\"Alamo\\" to Press Hill as Iraqi artillery began to bracket them, one of the Green Berets managed to destroy one T-55 that broke cover and attempted to advance toward them, finally a pair of US Navy F/A-18s arrived and drove off the remaining tanks with several bombs, ending the battle. SSG Jason Brown (ODA 391) SGT Jeff Adamec (ODA 392) and SSG Eric Strigotte (ODA 044) all were awarded Silver Star Medals for their actions during the battle.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.103-105 References 2\\\\.

He was Member of Parliament for Bolton North East from 1983 to 1997, originally as a Conservative before resigning to become an independent in February 1996 and then a Liberal Democrat in October 1996. Biography =Early life= Thurnham was born in Staines, Middlesex on 21 August 1938. His father was a tea planter in India, where he worked for Brooke Bond, and his mother was a physiotherapist. Thurnham spent much of his early life in southern India, before being educated at Eversley Preparatory School and Oundle School. He won a scholarship to read engineering at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and received an advanced diploma in engineering from Cranfield Institute of Technology in 1967, and then an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1969. =Career= Thurnham became a design engineer at NEI Parsons in Newcastle until 1966, and then a director at British Steam Specialties until 1972. He married his first wife in 1963, he moved to Leicester in 1967 and succeeded Sydney Wathes as MD of Wathes ltd., an established refrigeration and air conditioning company, which he grew to become the Wathes group of companies and later WR Group Holdings. He became a member of South Lakeland Council in 1982, and was elected as Member of Parliament in the new constituency of Bolton North East at the 1983 general election, defeating the Labour candidate Ann Taylor who had until the election represented Bolton West. He lived in Kendal while he was an MP, with his wife taking charge of his company. He was noted for his very strong support for the Abortion Act 1967 and for embryo research, and was a founder member of the Progress campaign group which promotes IVF. He became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Secretary of State for Employment Norman Fowler from 1987 to 1990, and was then PPS to both Eric Forth and Robert Jackson in 1991 to 1992, and finally to Secretary of State for the Environment Michael Howard (his contemporary at Peterhouse) from 1992 to 1993. He never secured ministerial office, but became a party whip. Bolton North East was a highly marginal seat, which Thurnham held by a wafer thin majority of 813 at the 1987 general election, reduced even further to only 185 at the 1992 general election, and subsequent boundary changes made his position worse. He first indicated that he would stand down at the next election, but instead put his name forward for the safer seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale. Thurnham was not interviewed, and Tim Collins - formerly an aide to John Major - was selected as the Conservative candidate instead. Thurnham resigned the Conservative party whip in February 1996, reducing John Major's majority in Parliament to two. At the time, Thurnham indicated that this was because of his dismay at the Scott Report and the Nolan Report, but subsequently chose to cross the floor to join the Liberal Democrats in October 1996. He did not contest the seat at the 1997 general election. After leaving the House of Commons, he was chairman of WR Group Holdings. He also ran a farm. =Family= He had a son and three daughters with his first wife, and they also adopted a son with cerebral palsy. They were divorced in 2004. He died of pancreatic cancer at home in Bentham, North Yorkshire on 10 May 2008, aged 69, the day after he married his second wife, Carole Emery.

Explosive detection is commonly used at airports, ports and for border control. Detection tools =Colorimetrics & automated colorimetrics= The use of colorimetric test kits for explosive detection is one of the most established, simplest, and most widely used methods for the detection of explosives. Colorimetric detection of explosives involves applying a chemical reagent to an unknown material or sample and observing a color reaction. Common color reactions are known and indicate to the user if there is an explosive material present and in many cases the group of explosive from which the material is derived. The major groups of explosives are nitroaromatic explosives, nitrate ester and nitramine explosives, and inorganic nitrate based explosives. Other groups include chlorates and peroxides which are not nitro based explosives. Since explosives usually contain nitrogen, the detection is mainly detecting nitrogenous compounds. Traditional colorimetric tests have a disadvantage: some explosive compounds (such as acetone peroxide) do not contain nitrogen and are therefore harder to detect. =Dogs= Specially trained dogs can be used to detect explosives using their noses which are very sensitive to scents. While very effective, their usefulness becomes degraded as a dog becomes tired or bored. These dogs are trained by specially trained handlers to identify the scents of several common explosive materials and notify their handler when they detect one of these scents. The dogs indicate a 'hit' by taking an action they are trained to provide ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†generally a passive response, such as sitting down and waiting. The explosive detection canine was originated at the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. in 1970, by then trainer Charles R. Kirchner.Newlon, Clark (1974). Police Dogs in Action. New York, Dodd, Mead & co. The explosive detection canine was first used in Algeria in 1959 under the command of General Constantine.. Recent studies suggest that mass spectrometric vapor analysis, such as secondary electrospray ionization (SESI-MS), could support canine training for explosive detection. =Honey bees= This approach couples trained honey bees with advanced video computer software to monitor the bee for the strategic reaction. Trained bees serve for 2 days, after which they are returned to their hive. This proven system is not yet commercially available. Biotechnology firm Inscentinel claims that bees are more effective than sniffer dogs. =Mechanical scent detection= Several types of machines have been developed to detect trace signatures for various explosive materials. The most common technology for this application, as seen in US airports, is ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). This method is similar to mass spectrometry (MS), where molecules are ionized and then moved in an electric field in a vacuum, except that IMS operates at atmospheric pressure. The time that it takes for an ion, in IMS, to move a specified distance in an electric field is indicative of that ion's size-to-charge ratio: ions with a larger cross section will collide with more gas at atmospheric pressure and will, therefore, be slower. Gas chromatography (GC) is often coupled to the detection methods discussed above in order to separate molecules before detection. This not only improves the performance of the detector but also adds another dimension of data, as the time it takes for a molecule to pass through the GC may be used as an indicator of its identity. Unfortunately, GC normally requires a bottled gas, which creates a consumable and ease of use issue for the system. GC columns operated in the field are prone to degradation from atmospheric gases and oxidation, as well as bleeding of the stationary phase. Columns must be very fast, as well, since many of the applications demand that the complete analysis be completed in less than a minute. =Spectrometry= Technologies based on ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) include ion trap mobility spectrometry (ITMS), and differential mobility spectrometry (DMS). Amplifying fluorescent polymers (AFP) use a molecular recognition to \\"turn off\\" or quench the fluorescence of a polymer. Chemiluminescence was used frequently in the 1990s, but is less common than the ubiquitous IMS. Several attempts are being made to miniaturize, ruggedize and make MS affordable for field applications; such as an aerosol polymer that fluoresces blue under UV but is colorless when it reacts with nitrogen groups. One technique compares reflected ultraviolet, infrared and visible light measurements on multiple areas of the suspect material. This has an advantage over olfactory methods in that a sample does not need to be prepared. A patent exists for a portable explosive detector using this method. Mass spectrometry is seen as the most relevant new spectrometry technique.. Several manufacturers have products that are under development, both in the US, Europe and Israel, including Laser-Detect in Israel, FLIR Systems and Syagen in the US and SEDET in Europe. =X-ray machines= Specially designed X-ray machines can detect explosives by looking at the density of the items being examined. They use Computed axial tomography based systems that are enhanced with dedicated software, containing an explosives threat library and false-color coding, to assist operators with their dedicated threat resolution protocols. X-ray detection is also used to detect related components such as detonators, but this can be foiled if such devices are hidden inside other electronic equipment. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been developed that can automatically detect threat in x-ray scans. =Neutron activation= Specially designed machines bombard the suspect explosives with neutrons, and read the gamma radiation decay signatures to determine the chemical composition of sample. The earliest developed forms of Neutron Activation Analysis use low energy neutrons to determine the ratios of nitrogen, chlorine, and hydrogen in the chemical species in question, and are an effective means of identifying most conventional explosives. Unfortunately, the much smaller Thermal Neutron Cross Sections of carbon and oxygen limit the ability of this technique to identify their abundances in the unknown species, and it is this reason in part that worldwide terror organizations have favored nitrogen absent explosives such as TATP in the construction of IEDs. Modifications to the experimental protocol can allow for easier identification of carbon and oxygen based species, (e.g. the use of inelastic scattering from fast neutrons to produce detectable gamma rays, as opposed to simple absorption occurring with the thermal neutrons), but these modifications require equipment that is prohibitively more complex and expensive, preventing their widespread implementation. =Silicon nanowires for trace detection of explosives= Silicon nanowire configured as field effect transistors have been demonstrated to detect explosives including TNT, PETN and RDX in sensitives superior to those of canines. The detection in this method is performed by passing a liquid or vapor containing the target explosive over the surface of a chip containing tens to hundreds of silicon nanowire sensing elements. Molecules of the explosive material interact with the surface of the nanowires and as a result induce a measurable change in the electrical properties of the nanowire. Detection aids A detection taggant can be added when explosives are made to make detection easier. The Montreal Convention 1991 is an international agreement requiring manufacturers of explosives to do this.. An example is with Semtex, which now is made with DMDNB added as a detection taggant. DMDNB is a common taggant as dogs are sensitive to it. In the UK the relevant legislation is the Marking of Plastic Explosives for Detection Regulations 1996. Bogus devices The US Department of Justice warned in a National Institute of Justice publication, \\"Guide for the Selection of Commercial Explosives Detection Systems for Law Enforcement Applications (NIJ Guide 100-99),\\" about the ongoing trend of \\"Bogus\\" explosives detection equipment being sold to unsuspecting consumers. The report mentions by name the Quadro Tracker, an apparent dowsing rod with a freely pivoting radio antenna rod with no functioning internal components. On August 8‚Äì9, 2005 the Naval Explosive Ordance Disposal Technical Division via the United States Counter Terrorism Technology Task Force conducted testing on the SNIFFEX and concluded that \\"the SNIFFEX handheld detector does not work\\". A number of fake dowsing rod-style detection devices have been widely used in Iraq and Thailand, notably the ADE 651 and GT200, where they have been reported to have failed to detect bombs that have killed hundreds of people and injured thousands more. Additional names of fake dowsing rod style detectors include ADE101, ADE650, Alpha 6, XK9, SNIFFEX, HEDD1, AL-6D, H3TEC, PK9.

A member of the Zezuru people of central Zimbabwe, Mutswairo wrote the first novel in the Shona language, Feso. In his late years, Mutswairo was a central figure in Zimbabwean academic and cultural circles. He was the first person to be named Writer-in-Residence at the University of Zimbabwe, and was the Chairman of the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe during the late 1990s. Mutswairo wrote the text for \\"Simudzai mureza weZimbabwe,\\" the Zimbabwean national anthem.  Literary contributions  Feso, originally published in Zezuru in 1957 when Zimbabwe was still the colony of Southern Rhodesia, is a narrative with subtle political implications set several hundreds years ago, before colonization. Beyond the use of the Shona language itself, the novel incorporates a number of features of traditional Zezuru oral culture, including song and storytelling techniques.D. Burgess, 453. Despite Mutswairo's association with the small intellectual elite in the country, Feso was widely read, and even taught in schools, until it was banned by the Rhodesian government in the mid-1960s.M. E. Burgess, 613. Mutswairo began studying in the United States in the early 1960s, originally through a Fulbright grant. He ultimately received his Ph.D. from Howard University in 1978, with a doctoral dissertation titled Oral Literature in Zimbabwe: An Analytico-Interpretive Approach. Though his research in Zimbabwean oral culture has been useful for both African and Western scholars,Bessant 46n. he has been considered something of a revisionist historian in his own country. He provoked some controversy by arguing, in a series of televised debates, that the Shona people should be referred to instead as \\"Mbire.\\" Chimhundu, 89. Later in life, Mutswairo wrote both poetry and prose in English. His two explicitly political historical novels, about 19th century pro-independence figure Kadungure Mapondera and Chaminuka, a sage from Zimbabwean folklore, were both written in English, and his English poetry is in a similar vein. In \\"The Picture of Nahanda and Kagubi,\\" he laments the fate of Nehanda Nyakasikana, a woman who was executed after inspiring a fight for independence in the 19th century: :Why, now, Nehanda Nyakasikana, Do you close your eyes, Mufakose, With your face gently lowered And your eyes staring long And looking down‚Äîheavy with tears. . .Quoted in Ranger, 127. Mutswairo explained that his poetry is more influenced by English poetry, with its regular meters, while traditional Shona poetry, based in repetition often found its way into his prose. Williams, 36-44. Since he also translated his own work in both directions, he acquired an unusually rich sense of the relationship between the two. He found, he says, intuitive ways of making leaps from one to the other, even if they sometimes defy word-for-word translation: :For example, an idiomatic expression like Chauinacho batisisa midzimu haipe kaviri: \\"What you have, hold on to it fast because the ancestors will not give it to you again.\\" If you wrote it the way I'm saying it now, it wouldn't make sense. Maybe it might be better to say, \\"A bird in hand is worth two in a bush.\\" And this has given you a totally different use although the idea is the same. So, there are many such expressions that are not synonymous, but somehow you can get the equivalent.Williams 36-44. Major works in English *Feso.

From then through 2009, it was held at a private retreat center near Willits, California, US, and at an alternate location in Plymouth, California, US from 2010 to 2012. In 2013, it was held on private property in Lake County, California and then returned to Willits in 2014 at another private retreat center. There is one main sound stage, with music playing almost continuously through the weekend by many DJs and, occasionally, live musicians. Attendance is limited to a few hundred people. It was started by the Cloud Factory community, then expanded and took on a unique character. Two inspirations were leaving an event and decided that a Chill/Downtempo event at the same location would be Awesome. A \\"Chill\\" event in \\"Willits\\" Ca. would be Known as \\"CHILLITS\\".  Music  Most of the DJs and live musicians who play at Chillits could be considered amateur, in the sense that they do not attempt to make a living from playing music but instead donate their time and services. Some are San Francisco Bay Area technology luminaries, such as Brian Behlendorf. Starting with the 2000 gathering, many of the sets have been recorded and made available for free online (see links below). In 2003, Mixmaster Morris performed at the event, and subsequently mentioned the campout in a BBC documentary later that same year. Following Morris's visit, additional recognition was garnered amongst the Internet community, resulting in the listing of music sets from Chillits on Boing Boing . Other notable visiting acts include Black Sifichi, Lena, Robert Leiner, Gamelan Anak Swarasanti , Safety Scissors, Wobbly, Quiet American, Jonah Sharp, Randy Jones and Balearic Mike.  Attendance  Due to the size of the venue, attendance at Chillits has always been extremely limited. The information sheet distributed with tickets says \\"Every year, the Chillits organizers agonize for months over how to distribute tickets so that everyone who wants to can attend. And every year, some good folks miss out. It's an obvious quandary: if we sold thousands of tickets then everyone could go, but we'd quickly lose the comfortable, laid-back vibe that makes Chillits so popular.\\" Ticket distribution is largely based on participation: collective members and others who involve themselves in the responsibilities and tasks made necessary by the planning and execution of the event are awarded the right to buy a pair of tickets. Basically, if you work it, you can attend. This work includes but is not limited to set-up and clean-up shifts, meal shifts, DJ/performance slots, door and parking shifts, equipment responsibilities, coordinator shifts, etc. There is a lottery system designed such that anyone who wants to attend may put their name in for a chance to get tickets, as well as a mailing list that facilitates the buying and selling of unneeded tickets, between private parties, right up until the event begins. There is obvious difficulty in trying to please everyone all the time, but over the years much effort has been expended toward pleasing as many people as possible. Few similar events have been created, despite the availability of this and other similar venues across the land, despite the obvious demand.

Torii was taken prisoner and directed to shout to his compatriots in the fortress that no help was on the way, and that they should surrender. He instead encouraged the garrison that Tokugawa's army was, in fact, on the way, and that they should keep fighting. There is some dispute as to whether Torii was crucified before or after this proclamation, as well as in the precise details of his execution. Nevertheless, the end result was the same. Although Sune'emon was an ashigaru class warrior, his family was promoted to samurai class and served the Okudaira family until the end of Edo period. One Takeda retainer, Ochiai Michihisa, even used an image of a crucified Torii Suneemon on his flag from then on. The flag is now stored in the University of Tokyo library.

He is the brother of the journalist Jean-Fran√ßois Kahn. He was a member of the French National Consultative Ethics Committee from 1992 to 2004 and worked in gene therapy. He first entered the INSERM with a specialization in biochemistry. He was named in 2002 as a counsellor for biosciences and biotechnologies matters by the European Commission. Head of French laboratories specialized in biomedical sciences between years 1984 and 2007, he has been elected as the President of the Paris Descartes University in December 2007, where he was the sole candidate.

Background In November 1931, the acting governor of Heilongjiang province General Ma Zhanshan chose to disobey the Kuomintang government's ban on further resistance to the Japanese invasion and attempted to prevent Japanese forces from crossing into Heilongjiang province by defending a strategic railway bridge across the Nen River near Jiangqiao. This bridge had been dynamited earlier by Ma's forces during the fighting against the pro-Japanese collaborationist forces of General Chang Hai-Peng. Battle Ruins of the Nenjiang Harge Bridge, where the battle was fought. A repair crew, guarded by 800 Japanese soldiers, went to work on 4 November 1931. Nearby were 2,500 Chinese troops under General Ma Zhanshan. Each side charged the other with opening fire without provocation. The Japanese claimed the Chinese opened fire using rifles and machine guns late in the day during a fog when Japanese troops started across the span. The Japanese retaliated and the skirmish continued for over three hours. Only 15 Japanese were reported killed and 120 Chinese, as the Japanese advanced and drove General Ma's remaining troops off toward Qiqihar. Later General Ma Zhanshan returned to counterattack with a much larger force. Although dislodging the Japanese from their advance positions, he was unable to recapture the bridge, which the Japanese continued to repair. Ma was eventually forced to withdraw his troops in the face of Japanese tanks and artillery. Consequences The repaired bridge made possible the further advance of Japanese forces and their armored trains. Despite his failure to hold the bridge, General Ma Zhanshan became a national hero in China for his resistance at Nenjiang Bridge, which was widely reported in the Chinese and international press. The publicity inspired more volunteers to enlist in the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies. Although often led by army officers and with numbers of former regular troops among their ranks, most volunteers had no previous military experience. These irregular armies were to later become the main anti-Japanese force in northeast China during 1932 and posed a serious obstacle to Japanese attempts to pacify the country.

It includes public art galleries and botanic gardens on , and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Paine Mansion was built for lumber baron Nathan Paine and his wife, Jessie Kimberly Paine. In 1925, upon the recommendation of Mary K. Shirk (Jessie's sister), the Paines commissioned Bryant Fleming, an architect from Ithaca, New York to design the estate. From the beginning, the Paines wanted to design an estate that would showcase exceptional architecture, furnishings, art and natural beauty, which would be open to the public for educational and cultural purposes. Construction of the Tudor Revival style mansion began in 1927 and the exterior was completed by 1930. By 1932, when the Great Depression hit and crippled the Paine Lumber Company, all remaining work on the house came to a halt. The Paines returned to the project in 1946 and established a non-profit organization to own and manage the estate for public benefit.http://darrow.law.umn.edu/documents/Very_Pictures_of_Anarchy_crane.pdf Nathan Paine died in 1947 at the age of 77. Jessie oversaw the remaining work on the estate, and the property opened to the public in 1948. Until Jessie's death in 1973 at the age of 100, she served as the museum's president while residing in La Jolla, California. The Paines never lived in the mansion. Features The Paine estate features a historic house museum with art gallery, and is surrounded by extensive gardens. The house contains French Barbizon school and American paintings, sculptures, and decorative woodworkings, Persian rugs, tapestries, and English and American silver and china. The Paine Center hosts changing exhibitions and offers educational programs related to historic architecture, art, and to nature. The estate's landscape gardens have twenty 'outdoor rooms' and designed areas, in various historical‚Äîtraditional and contemporary themes.

It was established in 1986 as a voluntary organisation to represent the ten district councils of Greater Manchester after the Greater Manchester County Council was abolished. AGMA develops policy, lobbies government and others, and runs a range of services designed to make strategic and tangible advances in the standard of living across Greater Manchester. Its Policy and Research Unit is based in Wigan, and its European Union office in Brussels, Belgium. The Local Government Act 1985, which abolished the metropolitan county councils of England, delegated the powers of the Greater Manchester County Council to the ten bottom-tier metropolitan district councils but also recognised that some functions--such as public transport, fire and rescue, police, and waste disposal--required co-ordination at a strategic, metropolitan level. In this capacity, AGMA directs the strategic public and social services of Greater Manchester on behalf of the boroughs, such as the Greater Manchester County Record Office, which exhibits elements of the local history of Greater Manchester. The Executive Board of AGMA is composed of representatives from Greater Manchester's ten metropolitan boroughs, and the Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority, the Greater Manchester Police Authority, the Greater Manchester Fire and Civil Defence Authority and the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority, who are all members by subscription. The local authorities of Blackpool, Blackburn with Darwen, Cheshire East and Warrington are associate members with representation at AGMA debates and meetings, but are excluded from voting processes. AGMA makes representations on behalf of Greater Manchester to the government of the United Kingdom, the North West Development Agency, the European Union,http://www.greater-manchester.eu business and other bodies, lobbying for investment and funding. AGMA actively pursued a formal and statutory government structure for Greater Manchester throughout the 2000s and made a successful bid to the UK's central government to constitute Greater Manchester as a Statutory City Region. Although not abolished, AGMA was effectively superseded by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, the first authority of its kind in the United Kingdom, on 1 April 2011. History =Background= The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) was established in 1986 following the Local Government Act 1985, which abolished the Greater Manchester County Council. It has operated as a voluntary association representing the collective interests of the local authorities within Greater Manchester and as a joint committee with responsibilities for a number of residual functions previously performed by the Greater Manchester County Council (such as public transport and waste management control). Section 48 of the Local Government Act 1985 provided AGMA and the Greater Manchester County Records Office any functions its constituent councils delegated to it.http://www.manchester.gov.uk/egov_downloads/9._Future_Governance_of_AGMA.pdf =Functions and constitution= The Wigan Investment Centre, the headquarters of AGMA, located by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, Wigan AGMA has been operating as a joint committee of the 10 Greater Manchester local authorities since its creation in 1986. Under its constitution (passed in 2008), the Executive Board of AGMA coordinates economic development, housing, planning, and together with the relevant statutory bodies, transport policies for Greater Manchester with a supporting structure of seven commissions. However, although the Executive Board has the power to establish the strategic commission, it is not a body corporate, and it has no formal functions in its own right. Those it has to depend on delegations from, or agreements by, its constituent local authorities. The AGMA Executive meets monthly to deal with strategic issues that impact Greater Manchester. AGMA also provides some joint services across Greater Manchester via AGMA Units and is developing policies and strategic initiatives, including its Greater Manchester Strategy. As at January 2010, six commissions are in operation, being: *Commission for the New Economy; *Environment; *Improvement & Efficiency; *Health; *Planning & Housing; and *Public Protection. =City region and combined authority= Following a bid from AGMA highlighting the potential benefits in combatting the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, it was announced in the 2009 United Kingdom Budget that Greater Manchester and the Leeds City Region would be awarded Statutory City Region Pilot status, allowing (if they desired) for their constituent district councils to pool resources and become statutory Combined Authorities with powers comparable to the Greater London Authority. The aim of the pilot is to evaluate the contributions to economic growth and sustainable development by Combined Authorities. The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 enabled the creation of a Combined Authority for Greater Manchester with devolved powers on public transport, skills, housing, regeneration, waste management, carbon neutrality and planning permission, pending approval from the ten councils. Such strategic matters would be decided on via a majority rule voting system involving ten members appointed from among the councillors of the ten metropolitan boroughs (one representing each borough of Greater Manchester with each council also nominating one substitute) without the input of the UK's central government. Committees will be formed from a pool of 33 councillors allocated by council population (roughly one councillor for every 75,000 residents) to scrutinise the running of bodies and their finances, approve the decisions and policies of said bodies and form strategic policy recommendations or projects for the approval of the ten-member panel. Retrieved on 18 March 2010. The ten district councils of Greater Manchester approved the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority on 29 March 2010, and submitted its final recommendations for its constitution to the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Transport. On 31 March 2010 the Communities Secretary John Denham approved the constitution and launched a 15-week public consultation on the draft bill together with the approved constitution. The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities requested that the new authority should be established in April 2011. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority had its inaugural meeting on 1 April 2011.

These performances evolved from celebrations of the liturgy to incorporate later dramatic and secular elements, and came to be performed in local languages. They were succeeded by the Passion Plays. Liturgical origins In the Middle Ages, the celebration of liturgical feasts was as rich and varied as they were numerous; poetry and music, in particular, were used to impress on the congregation the significance of the events commemorated. Liturgical worship is in itself dramatic, with its stylized dialogues and the use of choirs. Often, as at Christmas, Epiphany, and Easter, the text of the Gospel called for a variety of roles. The Benedictines of St. Gallen, in Switzerland, in the 10th century wrote sequences, hymns, litanies, and tropes and set them to music. The tropes--elaborations of parts of the Liturgy, particularly the Introit--found universal acceptance and remained in use in various forms until the end of the 17th century. These tropes were dramatic in construction and, as their musical settings prove, were sung alternately by two choirs of men and boys, or by two halfchoirs. The history of the ecclesiastical drama begins with the trope sung as Introit of the Mass on Easter Sunday. It has come down to us in a St. Gallen manuscript dating from the time of the 10th century monk Tutilo. The conversation held between the holy women and the angels at Christ's sepulchre forms the text of this trope, which consists of the four sentences: : Quem quaeritis in sepulchro, o christicolae : Jesum Nazarenum, o coelicolae : Non est hic. Surrexit, sicut praedixerat. : Ite nuntiate quia surrexit de sepulchro. : Resurrexi, postquam factus homo, tua jussa paterna peregi. The first three sentences are found in many liturgical books dating from the 10th to the 18th century. The trope, however, did not develop into a dramatic scene until it was brought into connection with the Descent from the Cross. It was widely commemorated in Continental monasteries, but appears first in a ritual of English origin, attributed to St. Dunstan (967). In giving directions for public services, the Ritual refers to this custom particularly as observed at Fleury-sur-Loire and Ghent. On Good Friday, after the morning services, a crucifix swathed in cloth was laid in a sort of grave arranged near the altar, where it remained until Easter morning. On Easter morning, after the third responsory of the Matins, one or two clerics clothed in albs, and carrying palms in their hands, went to the grave and seated themselves there. Thereupon three other priests vested in copes, and carrying censers representing the three holy women, joined them. Upon their arrival the \\"angel\\" asked them: \\"Whom seek ye?\\" The \\"women\\" answered; they hear from the \\"angel\\" the message of the Resurrection and were told to go forth and announce it. Then they intoned the antiphon: \\"Surrexit enim, sicut dixit dominus. Alleluia\\". The choir finished Matins with the Te Deum. This simplest form of liturgical Easter celebration was elaborated in many ways by the addition of Biblical sentences, hymns, and sequences, in particular the \\"Victimae paschali\\", which dates from the first half of the 11th century; also by the representation of St. Peter and St. John running to the grave, and by the appearance of Jesus, who thenceforth becomes the central figure. The union of these scenes in one concerted action (the dialogue), rendered in poetic form (hymns, sequences) or in prose (Bible texts), and the participation of a choir gave to the Nuremberg Easter celebration of the 13th century the character of a short chanted drama. Such celebrations, however, remained parts of the liturgy as late as the 18th century. They were inserted between Matins and Lauds, and served for the instruction of the people, whose hearts and minds were more deeply impressed by reproductions of the Resurrection of Jesus, which appealed to the senses, than by a sermon. The Latin text was no obstacle, since the separate parts of the plays were known or were previously explained. The wide diffusion of these liturgical plays, in which priests took the different parts, is proof of their popularity. At least 224 Latin Easter dramas are known to have existed, of which 159 were found in Germany, 52 in France, and the rest in Italy, Spain, Holland, and England. Development into drama The popular taste for dramatic productions was fed by these Easter celebrations. The clergy emphasized more and more the dramatic moments, often merely hinted at in the rude original celebrations, and added new subjects, among them some of a secular nature. They introduced the characters of Pontius Pilate, the Jews, and the soldiers guarding the sepulchre, added the figure of an ointment-vender bargaining with the holy women, and other features which did not contribute to the edification or instruction of the people, though they satisfied their love of novelty and amusement. In this way the early Easter celebrations became real dramatic performances, known as the Easter Plays. Since the element of worldly amusement predominated more and more (a development of which Gerhoh of Reichersberg complained as early as the 12th century), the ecclesiastical authorities began to prohibit the production of Easter Plays in the churches. It became necessary to separate them from church services, because of their length, which increased greatly, particularly after the introduction of the story of the Passion. Fragments of an Easter Play in Latin dating from the 13th century are found in the Benedictbeurn Easter Play, also in that of Klosterneuburg, both of which, probably, go back to the same source as the Mystery of Tours, composed as late as the 12th century, and which, better than any other, offers an insight into the development of the Easter Plays from the Latin Easter celebrations. Popularization When, in course of time, as shown in the Easter Play of Trier, German translations were added to the original texts as sung and spoken, the popularizing of the Easter Play had begun. That of Muri Abbey, in Switzerland, belongs to this period, and is written entirely in German. But it was only after the popular element had asserted itself strongly in all departments of poetry, in the 14th and 15th centuries, that the popular German religious drama was developed. This was brought about chiefly by the strolling players who were certainly responsible for the introduction of the servant, of the ointment-vender (named Rubin), whose duty it was to entertain the people with coarse jests (Wolfenb√ºttel, Innsbruck, Berlin, Vienna, and Mecklenburg Easter Plays, 1464). The Latin Easter Plays, with their solemn texts, were still produced, as well as the German plays, but gradually, being displaced by the latter, the Latin text was confined to the meagre Biblical element of the plays and the player's directions. The clergy still retained the right to direct these productions, even after the plays reflected the spirit and opinions of the times. Popular poetry, gross and worldly, dominated in the plays, particularly susceptible to the influence of the Carnival plays. Passion Plays The Easter Plays represented in their day the highest development of the secular drama; nevertheless this most important event in the life of Jesus did not suffice: the people wished to see his whole life, particularly the story of the Passion. Thus a series of dramas originated, which were called Passion Plays, the sufferings of Jesus being their principal subject. Some of them end with the entombment of Christ; in others the Easter Play was added, in order to show the Saviour in His glory; others again close with the Ascension or with the dispersion of the Apostles. But, since the persecution of the Saviour is intelligible only in the light of His work as teacher, this part of the life of Christ was also added, while some authors of these plays went back to the Old Testament for symbolical scenes, which they added to the Passion Plays as \\"prefigurations\\"; or the plays begin with the Creation, the sin of Adam and Eve, and the fall of the Angels. Again two short dramas were inserted: the Lament of Mary and the Mary Magdalene Play. The sequence \\"Planctus ante nescia\\", which was brought to Germany from France during the latter half of the 12th century, is the basis for the Lamentations of Mary. This sequence is merely a monologue of Mary at the foot of the Cross; by the introduction of John, the Saviour, and the bystanders as taking part in the lamentations, a dramatic scene was developed which became a part of almost all Passion Plays and has been retained even in their latest survivor. The Magdalene Play represents the seduction of Mary Magdalene by the devil and her sinful life up to her conversion. In Magdalene's sinfulness the people saw a picture of the depraved condition of mankind after the sin of the Garden of Eden, from which it could be redeemed only through the sacrifice of Christ. This profound thought, which could not be effaced even by the coarse reproduction of Magdalene's life, explains the presence of this little drama in the Passion Play.

Within 200 years of encounter, the original inhabitants of the area were decimated by disease and colonial warfare. Soon after the area was resettled by several groups of Native Americans displaced from other areas, including the Seminoles and Miccosukee. The springs are a historical attraction with documented accounts of tourism dating back to the 1880s. In the 1920s, the attraction was expanded to several structures that no longer exist, and a public swimming area was located at the spring.

The game was played on October 7, 1916, between the Georgia Tech Engineers and Cumberland College Bulldogs at Grant Field (now a part of Bobby Dodd Stadium) in Atlanta. With Cumberland opting to punt on multiple possessions, the infamous score can be partially attributed to 97% of the game's plays occurring in Cumberland territory, with 64 of those plays occurring in Cumberland's own red zone. Background Cumberland College, a Presbyterian school in Lebanon, Tennessee, had discontinued its football program before the season but was not allowed to cancel its game against the Engineers. The fact that Cumberland's baseball team had crushed Georgia Tech earlier that year 22‚Äì0 (amidst allegations that Cumberland used professionals as ringers) probably accounted for Georgia Tech coach John Heisman's running up the score on the Bulldogs, as Heisman was also Georgia Tech's baseball coach. It is speculated that Heisman may have deliberately aimed for a score of exactly 222 as a numerically significant retaliation to Cumberland's 22. He insisted on the schools' scheduling agreement, which required Cumberland to pay $3,000 () to Tech if its football team failed to show. In fact, Heisman actually paid Cumberland $500 () as an incentive to play the game; his letter to Cumberland's athletic department read in part: George E. Allen (who was elected to serve as Cumberland's football team student manager after first serving as the baseball team student manager) therefore put together a team of 12‚Äì16 players, most of whom were his fraternity brothers, to travel to Atlanta as Cumberland's football team. Another reason for Heisman's plan to run up the score was the practice among the sportswriters of the time to rank teams based upon how many points they scored. Since this statistic did not account for the strength or weakness of a team's opponent, Heisman disagreed with the amount of weight the writers tended to assign to it, and he may have unleashed his players on Cumberland to make his point. The game Cumberland received the opening kickoff and failed to make a first down. After a punt, the Engineers scored on their first play. Cumberland then fumbled on their next play from the line of scrimmage, and a Georgia Tech player returned the fumble for a touchdown. The Bulldogs fumbled again on their next play, and it took Georgia Tech two rushes to score its third touchdown. Cumberland lost nine yards on its next possession, and Georgia Tech scored a fourth touchdown on another two-play drive. Georgia Tech led 63‚Äì0 after the first quarter and 126‚Äì0 at halftime. Georgia Tech added 54 more points in the third quarter and 42 in the final period. Several players on the heavily-outmatched Cumberland side suffered serious injuries during the game, including quarterback Edwards, who was thrice carted off with concussions. Georgia Tech scored a total of 32 touchdowns, and Georgia Tech's left end James Preas kicked 18 extra points.\\"Makes a Record Score\\". The Washington Post. October 8, 1916. p. S3. Cumberland's only effective defense was an extra point blocked with a sort of human pyramid topped with Vichy Woods, who suffered a gruesome facial injury on the play. Despite scoring 32 touchdowns, the Engineers did not complete or attempt a forward pass: all their yardage came on rushes, returns or defensive plays. Several myths have developed around the game. Some have written that Cumberland did not have a single play that gained yards; in fact, its longest play was a 10-yard pass (on 4th-and-22 or 3rd-and-18). The Bulldogs gained positive yardage on at least six plays, though they fumbled on two of them. One page on Cumberland's website says Georgia Tech scored on every offensive play, but the play-by-play account of the game refutes this and suggests a more likely scenario: that Georgia Tech scored on every one of its sets of downs. Thus, neither team made a first down that was not also a touchdown, as Cumberland made no first downs in the entire game. Cumberland purportedly committed 15 turnovers‚Äînine fumbles and six interceptions‚Äîduring the game. Sportswriter Grantland Rice wrote, \\"Cumberland's greatest individual play of the game occurred when fullback Allen circled right end for a 6-yard loss.\\" At halftime, Heisman reportedly told his players, \\"You're doing all right, team, we're ahead. But you just can't tell what those Cumberland players have up their sleeves. They may spring a surprise. Be alert, men! Hit 'em clean, but hit 'em hard!\\" However, even Heisman relented, and shortened the third and fourth quarters from 15 minutes to 12. =Statistics= The game in action :These statistics are based on the play-by-play transcript and may be incomplete. { class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! rowspan=2Team !! colspan=4Rushing !! rowspan=4 !! colspan=4Passing !! rowspan=4 !! colspan=2Kicking - !

The modern-era record for most points scored against a college opponent is 106 by Fort Valley State of Georgia against Knoxville College in 1969. In the previous year Houston defeated Tulsa 100‚Äì6 to set the NCAA record in major college football. In 1949 the University of Wyoming defeated University of Northern Colorado 103‚Äì0. The Division III football scoring record was set in 1968 when North Park University defeated North Central College 104‚Äì32, using ten passing touchdowns along the way.North Central College Football Record Book (). Legacy The game ball had the score written on it as a memento. It was donated to the Helms Athletic Foundation sports museum by Bill Schroeder, an avid sports collector. When the museum moved locations in the 1980s, the ball was boxed and remained in storage. In 2014, Ryan Schneider, a Georgia Tech alumnus, purchased the ball in a charity auction for $40,388 ($33,657 without buyer's premium), with the intention of donating it back to Georgia Tech. One of the Cumberland players, Dow R. Cope, enlisted in the U.S. Army Signal Corps after graduation. He died in a plane crash on June 9, 1918 while serving in France during World War I.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/154007501/dow- russel-cope In October 1956, a 40th reunion was held for players from both teams, of whom 28 were able to attend. While reminiscing, one of the Cumberland players pointed out one play that saved Cumberland from an even worse defeat; had Cumberland punted as normal instead of running a sneak, the score would probably have been 229‚Äì0.

He has been acclaimed as the world's youngest marathon runner. He ran from Puri to Bhubaneswar at the age of five covering in seven hours and two minutes and was listed as the world's youngest marathon runner in the 2006 edition of the Limca Book of Records, an Indian record book. Early life Singh was born in Odisha in 2002. His father died at an early age. As a consequence of their poverty, Singh was sold by his mother to a traveling salesman for 850 at the age of two. Because of the ill- treatment thereafter, his mother sought out Biranchi Das, a local judo coach and orphanage operator, and asked him to take the boy on. Biranchi reimbursed the salesman's purchase price of Singh and the child came to live with Das and his other orphans at a local Judo Hall. One day Das caught him being a \\"saucy lad\\". He punished him by making him run, but then forgot about him; he returned after five hours and Singh was still running. After medical check up his heart was found to be normal even after running for hours. He then began to train him to run marathons. By the age of four, Budhia had run and completed 50 marathons. After running a record breaking marathon, Budhia was admitted to the SAI sports hostel in Bhubaneswar. However, he \\"felt like he was lodged in a jail.\\" After staying in the hostel for almost nine years, Budhia is now at home, living with his mother, Sukantio Singh, and his sister. Career and controversy Budhia's running ability has led to celebrity status and he has appeared in a number of television commercials. These commercials and Budhia's fame allegedly led to significant financial gains for Das, which led to accusations of exploitation. An inquiry by Indian child welfare officials was launched in January 2006; Das refuted the allegations. A feature-length documentary called Marathon Boy was released in 2011 that focused on Singh and Das's relationship over a five-year period from 2006. The documentary was funded by HBO & BBC Storyville, and was nominated for an Emmy. In the film, Budhia makes a withdrawal of his accusations against Das.Marathon Boy - HBO Singh was no longer running long distances by the age of 13 in 2015, and was running one or two hours of conditional training per day. Sambit Mohapatra, a sports journalist wrote that \\"He cannot even win his school race these days. Budhia used to run for kilometres. But his coach never tested his ability with other sprinters before he was shoved into the sports hostel...His future doesn't look promising\\". Despite this, Singh himself has said that he would like to one day represent India at the Olympics in the men's marathon. Murder of Biranchi Das Das was shot dead at Buxi Jagabandhu Bidyadhar College on the evening of 13 April 2008. According to police, Das was sitting inside the judo centre with friends after a training session at the time of the attack. Das's murder was not related to his treatment of Singh; it resulted after Das incurred the wrath of a gangster, Raja Acharya, after Das reportedly tried to defend a model, Leslie Tripathy, who was allegedly being harassed by Raja. Das's murderers, Sandeep Acharya (alias Raja), and his associate, Akshya Behera, (alias Chagala) were sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2010. Biographical film A biographical film of Singh and Das's relationship, Budhia Singh ‚Äì Born to Run, was directed by Soumendra Padhi and released in 2016. It starred Mayur Patole as Singh and Manoj Bajpayee as Das. The Film won a national award for best children's film at the 63rd National awards.

It was endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands, although there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands. The last confirmed sighting was in 1904. Other common names were Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crowned-pigeon and Kuvojo. The Choiseul pigeon was monotypic within the genus Microgoura and had no known subspecies. Its closest living relative is believed to be the thick-billed ground pigeon, and some authors have suggested that the Choiseul pigeon may be a link between that species and the crowned pigeons. The adult pigeon was largely blue-grey, with a buffy orange belly and a distinctive slaty-blue crest. It is unknown how this crest was held by the bird in life. The bird's head sported a blue frontal shield surrounded by black feathers and a bicoloured beak. The wings were brown and the short tail was a blackish purple. It was described as having a beautiful rising and falling whistling call. As the bird became extinct before significant field observations could be made, not much is known about its behaviour. It is believed to have been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It is believed to have been rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct. Taxonomy The related thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) The Choiseul pigeon was described by Walter Rothschild in 1904 on the basis of six skins‚Äîthree male and three female‚Äîand an egg collected by Albert Stewart Meek earlier that year. It was placed in the monotypic genus Microgoura, whose name comes from the Ancient Greek word mikros \\"small\\", and goura, a New Guinean aboriginal name for the similarly- crested crowned pigeons of the genus Goura. Rothschild named the species after Meek, giving the bird the specific name meeki. Though its relationships are unclear, the Choiseul pigeon is believed to have been closest to the thick- billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, which has similar plumage. It has been suggested that the Choiseul pigeon was a link between the thick-billed ground pigeon and the crowned pigeons; however, other sources argue that it may not have been closely related to the crowned pigeons as its crest was quite different. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the Choiseul pigeon should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons, the dodo, the Rodrigues solitaire, and others. The Choiseul pigeon has no known subspecies. Today, five skins and a partial skeleton are kept in the American Museum of Natural History, while a single skin and the egg are kept at the Natural History Museum at Tring. The Choiseul pigeon is also known as the Solomon crowned pigeon, Solomon Islands pigeon, Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crested pigeon, Choiseul crested pigeon, crested Choiseul pigeon, Meek's pigeon, Meek's ground pigeon, and dwarf goura. The indigenous peoples of Choiseul called the species either \\"kumku-peka\\" or \\"kukuru-ni-lua\\", which translates literally as \\"pigeon-belong-ground\\". Description Illustration showing alternate crest arrangement The Choiseul pigeon was about long. The wing of the male was , the tail , the culmen , and the tarsus was . The wing of the female was , the tail , the culmen , and the tarsus was . Adult Choiseul pigeons of both sexes were blue-grey overall with a buffy orange belly. The pigeon had a distinctive long, rounded crest that had a hairy texture. This crest, like the crown, was slaty-blue and emerged from the bird's hindcrown. Though many artists have speculated, it is unknown how the pigeon held its crest in life as Meek's notes did not cover this subject. John Gerrard Keulemans (who produced the illustration accompanying Rothschild's original description), depicted the crest as being flat based on Meek's specimens; other artists have presented it as spread and scraggly like that of the crowned pigeons. It has been suggested that the crests of the museum specimens were flattened during preparation. On the bird's forehead was a naked and pale chalky-blue frontal shield. This was surrounded by short, velvety black feathers that extended from the base of the bill to the area just below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash. The bird's chin and throat were sparsely covered with black, velvety feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish- grey breast. The abdomen and undertail-coverts were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey. The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown. The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail- coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and rounded, was a very dark indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper mandible was chalky-blue with a black tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The bird's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the iris was a dark brown. The bird's voice was never recorded; however, after it became extinct, the indigenous peoples described it as possessing a \\"beautiful rising and falling whistling call given from the roost site every evening.\\" Others described the call as a low \\"c-r-r-ooo\\", \\"cr-ooo\\", or \\"cr-o-o-o\\". Behaviour and ecology Not much is known about the species' behaviour, as it became extinct before significant field observations could be made. It is likely that the Choiseul pigeon was a largely terrestrial species, feeding and nesting near the forest floor. The indigenous people of the town of Vundutura said that the pigeon would roost in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs close to the ground. They claimed that the species was very tame, allowing local hunters to approach it and pick it up off of its perch by hand. They reported that the species had stones in its gizzard. It laid a single dark, cream-coloured egg in an unlined depression on the ground. The egg was about in size, which is considered small in proportion to the bird. Distribution and habitat Lowland forest in the Solomon Islands, 2012 The Choiseul pigeon was non-migratory and is thought to have lived on the forest floor in lowland forests, including coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. The Choiseul pigeon is usually considered to have been endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands off the coast of New Guinea, where the only specimens were collected. The specimens Meek acquired were likely collected near Choiseul Bay in the northern part of the island. The last reports of the species from the indigenous population came from the Kolombangara River. It also reportedly lived on the neighboring islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita, and it is suspected that it may once have lived on Bougainville Island. However, these reports were never confirmed and must be considered anecdotal. It would be considered very unusual if the Choiseul pigeon were truly endemic to Choiseul as the island hosts no other endemic species, and the pigeon was never linked ecologically with another species on the island. = Last sightings = In January 1904 six specimens and an egg were collected by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul. Several local boys told Meek that the pigeon was also present on the nearby islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita. Though Meek did not travel to these islands, he did search for the Choiseul pigeon on the adjacent Bougainville Island, but did not find any evidence of its presence. No other specimens were ever collected or seen by Western scientists. The Choiseul pigeon was not searched for again until briefly in 1927 and again in October 1929, when five veteran collectors belonging to the Whitney South Seas Expedition dedicated three months to searching for the pigeon in multiple locations across Choiseul without success. The indigenous people interviewed by this expedition largely believed that the pigeon was extinct in 1929. The last reported indigenous sighting was sometime in the early 1940s near Sasamungga by the Kolombangara River, although this sighting was never confirmed. Searches of the small, cat-free islands of Rob Roy Island and Wagina off Choiseul's southeast coast and Choiseul's forested coastal swampland in the 1960s by British ornithologist Shane A. Parker did not discover any signs of the pigeon. American scientist Jared Diamond searched for the bird in 1974 without success. Relationship with humans Choiseul pigeon on the flag of the Choiseul Province This pigeon was a source of food for the local people, who would locate its roosting sites either due to the bird calling or by the droppings that had accumulated below its perches. It was well-remembered by the indigenous peoples, and stories of the delicious ground-dwelling pigeon were passed down by local elders after its extinction. One indigenous person implied that the gizzard stones of the pigeon may have had value locally. After the bird's extinction, the indigenous people have occasionally confused the Choiseul pigeon with the arboreal crested cuckoo- dove in modern folklore, and several claims of the pigeon's continued existence turned out to be based on the cuckoo-dove. After its discovery, several Western bird collections highly desired its skins; the Whitney South Seas Expedition spent three months at high expense on Choiseul with the primary objective being the acquisition of the Choiseul pigeon. In 2012 the Choiseul pigeon was commemorated on a stamp from Mozambique along with several other extinct birds. The Choiseul pigeon is depicted on the flag of the Choiseul Province. =Extinction= The indigenous population believed that the pigeon became extinct due to predation by feral cats and, to a lesser extent, feral dogs. As Choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals, the ground-dwelling pigeon was particularly susceptible to the introduced cats. If the pigeon existed on islands that feral cats had never reached, it is believed that the clearance of its forest habitat would have led to its local extinction. As there have been no substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches, the IUCN has declared it extinct. As several ornithologists had visited Choiseul and the nearby islands prior to Meek without noting any sign of the bird's existence, it is likely that the Choiseul pigeon was already close to extinction in 1904.

He was the co-founder of Franklin & Armfield, which became the largest slave trading firm in the United States. Based in Alexandria, Virginia, it also had offices in New Orleans and other Louisiana cities. Franklin owned six plantations in Louisiana and Tennessee. His Fairvue plantation, in Sumner County, Tennessee, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1841, Franklin left slave trading and devoted his energy to the plantations and other property interests. At the age of 50, he was married, for the first time, to Adelicia Hayes of Nashville. None of their four children survived to adulthood. In the late 19th century, his widow eventually sold the Louisiana plantations. In West Feliciana Parish, his former Angola and other plantations were bought by the state in 1901 and converted for use as Louisiana State Penitentiary, the largest maximum- security prison in the United States. Early life Isaac Franklin was born on May 26, 1789 at Pilot's Knob Plantation on Station Camp Creek in Sumner County, Tennessee. His father James Franklin (1755-1825 or 1828) and grandfather Charles (1735-1769) came from Baltimore, Maryland, and served in the Revolutionary War. He was later listed by militia leader James Robertson as one of the \\"Immortal Seventy\\" who were granted each of land by the state of North Carolina for their service.Kenneth C. Thomson, Jr., \\"Isaac Franklin was a Well-Liked Slave Trader,\\" in Gallatin Examiner, Thurs. May 13, 1976. (North Carolina then claimed Tennessee as part of its territory to the west.) Isaac's mother was Mary Lauderdale. James Franklin prospered in Tennessee‚Äîas each of his sons reached adulthood, he presented them with a horse, a bridle, and a pocket knife. When Isaac was twenty-one years old, he received his share and, according to tradition, used the knife to carve a ship miniature. He sold this to a friend for one dollar. In fifteen years he had made a fortune in slave trading. Career Franklin took up slave trading in 1810. After serving in the War of 1812, Franklin resumed the trade. The Franklin and Armfield Office in Alexandria, Virginia. In 1828 Franklin formed a partnership with his nephew John Armfield when Isaac's father James died and bequeathed land and slaves to he and his brother James. They set up Franklin & Armfield in Alexandria, Virginia (then part of the District of Columbia). Between 1828 and 1837, Franklin & Armfield became \\"the largest slave trading firm\\" in the United States. Franklin also had offices in New Orleans, the major slave trading center in the South, St. Francisville, and Vidalia, Louisiana.Wendell Holmes Stephenson, Isaac Franklin, Slave Trader and Planter (Louisiana State University Press 1938) at p. 4 Franklin admitted in letters to raping some of the women he bought and sold as slaves. The firm owned six ships to take slaves from Alexandria in the coastwise trade to the Deep South. The ships returned with cargoes of sugar, molasses, whiskey, and cotton. The Fairvue Plantation house, near Gallatin in Sumner County. Franklin made his Tennessee plantation, \\"Fairvue,\\" his home. Once Fairvue was finished, he turned toward Louisiana, where he purchased six plantations, named \\"Bellevue\\", \\"Killarney\\", \\"Lochlomond\\", \\"Angola\\", \\"Loango\\" and \\"Panola\\"; much later, land of the combined plantations was used for Angola State Penitentiary. He also bought thousands of acres of land in Texas, as well as a turnpike, bank stock, and a third interest in the Nashville Race Course. After 1835, his activity as a slave trader reduced as he moved his efforts to his plantation interests. When he died in 1846, he owned of land in Louisiana and more than 600 slaves. Personal life In 1839, at the age of fifty, he married socialite Adelicia Hayes (1817‚Äì1887), the daughter of Oliver Bliss Hayes (1783-1858), a lawyer and a Presbyterian minister, and Sarah Clemmons Hightower (1795-1871). By the time of his marriage to Hayes, Franklin had fathered a child with an enslaved woman named Lucinda who he had been consistently raping for about five years. Soon after this wedding Franklin sold the enslaved woman and her child, whose fates are unknown. Franklin and his wife Adelicia had four children: Victoria, Adelicia, Emma, and Julius Caesar. All died in early childhood.James A. Hoobler, Sarah Hunter Marks, Nashville: From the Collection of Carl and Otto Giers, Arcadia Publishing, 2000, p. 36 Upon his death in 1846, Franklin left his slave trading fortune, plantations, and slaves to his wife Adelicia. She later married again, and had Belmont Mansion and its estate built in what was then country outside Nashville in 1853.History of Belmont Mansion, http://www.belmontmansion.com/history Death and legacy Isaac Franklin died on April 27, 1846 in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. His corpse was preserved in alcohol and he was taken to Fairvue. By a will he made in 1841, Franklin made a bequest to endow a school or seminary at Fairvue. The will was the subject of protracted litigation by his nephew and former partner Armfield.Franklin v. Armfield, 2 Sneed (TN) 305, 34 Tenn. 305 (1854) His widow sold Fairvue to William Franklin and remarried the following year. She leased, and later in the 19th century sold, the Louisiana plantations to Samuel James, who leased convict labor (mostly black) from the state to work them. The state acquired the merged plantations under the name Angola in 1901; this land was used for the development of Angola Prison.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery, New York: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 97 See also *Slavery in the United States#Slave trade References  External links  * Category:1789 births Category:1846 deaths Category:People from Sumner County, Tennessee Category:Businesspeople from Alexandria, Virginia Category:People from St. Francisville, Louisiana Category:American military personnel of the War of 1812 Category:American planters Category:American slave traders Category:American slave owners ","title":"Isaac Franklin"},{"id":"3620520","text":"As a four letter acronym, NYSF can be: * National Youth Science Forum, an Australian STEM outreach programme * New York Shakespeare Festival, now known as Shakespeare in the Park, is a theatrical program in Central Park, New York City ","title":"NYSF"},{"id":"3620524","text":"The Theatine Church of St. Cajetan (German: Theatinerkirche St. Kajetan) is a Catholic church in Munich, southern Germany. Built from 1663 to 1690, it was founded by Elector Ferdinand Maria and his wife, Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, as a gesture of thanks for the birth of the long-awaited heir to the Bavarian crown, Prince Max Emanuel, in 1662. Now administered by the Dominican Friars, it is also known as the Dominican Priory of St. Cajetan. The church was built in Italian high-Baroque style, inspired by Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome, designed by the Italian architect Agostino Barelli. His successor, Enrico Zuccalli, added two 66 meters high towers, originally not planned, and then finished the high dome in 1690. The church is long and wide. The facade in Rococo style was completed only in 1768 by Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s. Its Mediterranean appearance and yellow coloring became a well known symbol for the city and had much influence on Southern German Baroque architecture. Architecture Theatine Church, about 1700 (Copperplate engraving by Michael Wening) The Theatinerkirche in Munich Interior of the church The dome Theatine Church as seen from South After the crown prince and later elector Max Emanuel had been born on 11 July 1662, Agostino Barelli from Bologna received the draught order. As a construction site for church and cloister the north-east corner of the cross quarter was selected directly by the town wall and Schwabinger Gate which lies opposite to the Residence. Already on 29 April 1663 the laying of the foundation stone occurred. Barelli took as a model the mother's church of the Theatines, Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome. During the shell works it came to violent discussions between Barelli and his site manager Antonio Spinelli, even Theatine and father confessor of Henriette which finally led to Barelli's dismissal. Agostino Barelli still completed the shell till 1674 and then left Munich. In the same year Enrico Zuccalli took over the artistic management. Main focus of his activity was the outside creation. Zuccalli determined the form of the dome and the very unconventional towers. At the same time he also co-operated in the decorative arrangement of the church interior decisively. Also in 1674 Giovanni Nicol√≤ Perti and Antonio Viscardi as well as Abraham Leuthner began with the stucco works. The interior has a rich stucco decoration, executed by Nicol√≤ Petri (1685‚Äì1688), Wolfgang Leutner being responsible for the stucco figures. The great black pulpit is a work of Andreas Faistenberger (1686). The altars house paintings of Caspar de Crayer, Carlo Cignani, Georg Desmar√©es and Joachim von Sandrart. For the altar from 1722 Balthasar Ableithner created the larger-than-life statues of four evangelists, the statues of Saint Marcus and Saint John have survived the destruction of World War II. On 11 June 1675 the church was consecrated ‚Äì it was extensive at that time still in the shell state. Long discussions about the final facade creation delayed the completion; a final result was not found. Thus Zuccalli established first between 1684 and 1692 after his plans the towers, in 1688 the interior equipment was completed. From 1692 up to the completion Viscardi took over the site management. Henriette of Savoy did not experience the completion of the Theatinerkirche, as she died in 1676. The outside facade of the Theatinerkirche still remained furthermore incomplete, because in spite of long discussions no arrangement could be achieved. Only about 100 years after the inauguration in 1765 the old Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s made a draft for the facade in the style of the rococo with only light changes which were completed by his son Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s the Younger. The cloister construction was carried out in line with the manuscript of Zuccalli under whose management the master builder Lorenzo Perti created the buildings. Church and cloister formed a large quadrangle. When the Schwabinger Gate was broken down in 1817 the Theatinerkirche became a major visual point with the construction of the Ludwigstrasse. The facade of the Ludwigskirche with two steeples was later constructed as balance to the Theatinerkirche, which stands diagonally opposite. History The Theatines gained a good reputation as pastors and scholars, until the late 18th Century when an increasing decline of religious discipline and the monastery finances became noticeable. Therefore, Elector Max IV Joseph, later King Max I Joseph, closed the monastery on 26 October 1801, i.e., before the secularization. The Theatinerkirche remained Collegiate Church, Court Church, and the convent attracted the remaining three electoral departments (ministries) a (Finance, Justice and Spiritual Affairs). Already in 1799 i.e., before dissolution of the monastery, the Department of Foreign Affairs had moved into the Theatine monastery. During the Second World War, particularly in the years 1944/45, the church was bombed, and the west wing of the monastery was destroyed. The altarpiece of the foundation of the Theatine Church (Antonio Zanchi, 1675), a donation of the electoral couple, was also destroyed. The restoration began in 1946, and was largely completed by 1955. Since 1954, the Dominicans have ministered at St. Cajetan. The reconstruction of the monastery was completed in 1973. Since 2001, a comprehensive overhaul has been in progress, in which the Theatinerkirche will also get a new sanctuary design. Organs The church has three organs: the main organ from 1960/2009, located in the choir behind the altar (49 stops/67 ranks), the antiphonal organ on the right side (across the pulpit), built in 1950 (18 stops/23 ranks; playable from a two- manual console and the five-manual main console), and a positive organ from 2018 (4 stops). Another organ predates both and was built in 1686 when the church was first constructed. The antiphonal organ was built by Anton Bayr (de) in 1782. The organ, like much of Munich, suffered damage during the Allied bombings of World War II and was rebuilt by local organ builder Carl Schuster in 1950. Burials A small chapel contains the tombs of King Maximilian II (reg. 1848-1864) and his consort Queen Marie.

They are also given training in time management, interview skills and public speaking. In previous years it has been known as the National Science Summer School (NSSS). The Forum is a residential program and takes place during January in Canberra and Brisbane. All activities are supervised by student staff and resident Rotary counsellors. The program is extremely intensive with little time for outside activities except for meeting those people already in the program. The most important aspect coming from the NYSF is a network of friends, colleagues and support groups throughout Australia which will be of value to participants for the whole of their lives. Very select students from New Zealand, South Africa and England are now also involved. The NYSF continues after January, first in the form of university seminars and industry site visits in March and April and afterwards as a long term personal network of people with common aims. History The NSSS was funded in 1983 by the Canberra Development Board with assistance from many Canberra and outside organisations including Rotary, The Australian National University (ANU), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE) (now the University of Canberra). The concept was developed through Mr Neville Whiffen, then Chairman of the Canberra Development Board, with the support of members of Rotary in District 968, Sydney, and was organised by the staff of the CCAE. The first NSSS was held in January 1984 with 198 students selected from across Australia. Mainstays of the program were Mr Bob Mitchell (subsequently Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra), Mr Ian Frencham (formerly CCAE, now retired), Dr Rodney Jory (University of Canberra, the founding Director of the NYSF), Mr and Mrs Ken Shields (Rotary Club of St. Ives, Sydney), Mr and Mrs Ted Armstrong (Rotary, Canberra) and six Rotarian couples, \\"house parents\\", one couple from each State in Australia. After this first success, the NSSS was incorporated on 5 June 1984, a Council set up and a Director appointed. Over the next few years, many changes were made to improve the program. The 1985 NSSS introduced specialised activity groups and for the first time, the Director was assisted by seven students, all of whom had attended in the previous year, who were invited to return as staff members. For January 1987 the NSSS was split into two sessions of two weeks, each of 138 students, 10 student staff, two Rotarian couples, and the Director. In 1990 CRA Limited advised that it would support the NSSS financially, providing $120,000, and the NSSS became \\"The CRA National Science Summer School\\". The numbers increased to 144 per session. The scope of each of the subject groupings was widened to provide for groups only in physics/engineering, chemistry, biology and geology. The 1991 NSSS saw the introduction of graduate seminars where students were able to question former students of the NSSS, who have now graduated, on their career choices, while the 1992 NSSS saw all student staff brought to Canberra during the Easter break of 1991 and given additional training. Subsequently, a larger responsibility was placed on the shoulders of these people in the following January, further emphasising the student nature of the NSSS organisation. Job Interviews for all students were introduced in 1993, and formal University Seminars (reunions) were held in all mainland State capitals in the following March. In January 1995 the NSSS changed its name to \\"NYSF,\\" a name more accurately reflecting the meaning of the program, and in September of that same year, Mrs Sandra Meek joined the staff of the NSSS Inc. taking over the responsibility of maintaining the student database from Mrs Ada Meek who now was able to concentrate more on program matters. January 1997 was the last CRA NYSF as CRA Limited and RTZ Plc were later in the year merged to form Rio Tinto and this was to be the future prefix. However, early in 1998, almost concurrently with the appointment of John Sandeman as Chairman of Council, Rio Tinto announced that January 1999 was to be its last year of full sponsorship (at $200,000) and that the sponsorship would be halved for January 2000 and drop to $25,000 thereafter. Rio Tinto very generously made $25,000 available to assist with a sponsorship search and provided two weekends of professional seminars in which Council members and past students were given advice into how to find sponsors. Council set an initial target of $400,000 for January 2001 and saw this as made up of 8 University sponsors and 8 industry sponsors each at $25,000 pa. The concept of university sponsors was only possible after the emphasis that had been placed on universities at both Orientation and University Seminars in the past few years. The NYSF in January 2000 was, for the first time the \\"National Youth Science Forum\\" with no sponsor name. Partner universities and industry groups took part in both sessions and changed the emphasis from mining industry base of past years to a university/industry base. In November 2000, Mrs Ada Meek retired from the office after being with the NYSF for 17 years. The Council expressed its gratitude to Ada for the influence she had had on the organisation over those years. With a full-time replacement for Ada and the Director now full-time, the NSSS Inc. employed, from December 2000, 4 full-time staff and a part-time accountant. Applications for the January 2001 NYSF remained the same as in previous years but surprisingly the numbers of boys and girls at session A was essentially the same. In session B, however, there were 84 girls to 60 boys, the reason for the big difference being a mystery. Six South Africans joined the six New Zealanders as students included in the subject groups. Two Canadians from the Canada Wide Science Fair were present during Session A. In 2005, after years of dedication to the program, the Director, Prof. Rod Jory retired and was replaced by Geoff Burchfield. Geoff was previously the head of CSIRO‚Äôs Media Unit in Canberra. The 2010 NYSF was an expansion of previous years, with a third session being held in Perth, overseen by the new Associate Director, Tom Grace. After 8 years at the helm of the organisation, Geoff Burchfield stepped down as Director in 2013 to focus on program development for the NYSF.From the Director, NYSF Oulook, July 2013 His successor is Damien Pearce. During 2017 session, it was announced that a third session was to open for 2018. This is to be hosted at University of Queensland in Brisbane. Application process Applications are open to all Year 11 students who are permanent residents of Australia, and are interested in proceeding to tertiary studies in Australia to do a science, engineering or technology course. Applications close 31 May each year for the following January forum. To become a participant of the NYSF, Rotary International select a number of pupils in which they will sponsor to go to the Forum, which includes an interview, impromptu speech, group and social activities, and depending on schools and rotary clubs, examinations.

Canadian and U.S. players competing at the 2015 World Sled Hockey Challenge. Sledge hockey (also known as Para ice hockey, or sled hockey in American English) is an adaptation of ice hockey designed for players who have a physical disability. Invented in the early 1960s at a rehabilitation centre in Stockholm, Sweden, and played under similar rules to standard ice hockey, players are seated on sleds and use special hockey sticks with metal \\"teeth\\" on the tips of their handles to navigate the ice. Via its division World Para Ice Hockey, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) acts as the international sanctioning body for the sport by means of its World Para Ice Hockey division. Para ice hockey has been played in the Winter Paralympics since 1994, and has been one of the most popular events. History Two men from Sweden designed the sledge in the 1960s because they wanted to continue to play hockey despite their physical disabilities. Their design included two skate blades on a metal frame that allowed the puck to pass underneath. They completed the ensemble by including two round poles with bike handles for sticks. Although there are many restrictions to the measurements and weight of the sleds used in the Paralympic Games, the basic design of modern sleds remains true to the original 1960's simple sleds for kids. These sleds were then made to be used hockey. Despite the initial lack of interest and awareness in the few years that followed, competition between sledge hockey teams started up in 1971 that included five teams in Europe. In 1981, Great Britain established their first sledge hockey team, and that was shortly followed by Canada in 1982. It was not until 1990 that the United States developed their first ice sledge hockey team. Sled hockey continued to expand when Estonia and Japan developed their teams in 1993. Sledge hockey was introduced to the Winter Paralympics in 1994, with Sweden claiming the first gold medal. Since 2010, sledge hockey has been a mixed-gender event. On November 30, 2016, as part of an effort to improve and unify the marketing of its self-sanctioned sports outside of the Paralympic Games, and citing that the word \\"sledge\\" had differing meanings between languages, the International Paralympic Committee announced that it would henceforth refer to sledge hockey as Para ice hockey (with its sanctioning sub-division consequently renamed World Para Ice Hockey).  Equipment  Shayba Arena in its para ice hockey configuration at the 2014 Winter Paralympics: the entrance to the players' benches and penalty boxes are flush with the ice surface, to make it easier for players to enter them. The floors are coated in ice or smooth plastic to prevent damage to the sledges. The sticks have a blade curved at one end in a manner similar to regular ice hockey, and generally six to eight metal teeth at the opposite end of the blade for maneuvering and propulsion. Movement is achieved by using the metal teeth as a means to grip the ice and push oneself forward. The metal teeth cannot be too pointy nor protrude farther than 1 cm beyond the stick, to prevent damage to the ice or injury of other players. Other equipment includes a helmet with facemask, shoulder and elbow pads, shin guards, and hockey gloves. Pants and footwear are at the discretion of both the player's comfort and need. Goaltenders wear the standard mask, chest and arm protector, blocker pad and catching glove, plus a leg pad if they so desire and a stick with teeth on both the paddle as well as the knob of the stick. Additionally, goalies may make modifications to their equipment: a common mod is to attach the plastic outsoles of track spikes onto the outer part of their gloves to aid in lateral mobility. Carbon fiber sledge hockey sticks  Rules  Essentially all of the standard rules of ice hockey apply to sledge hockey. The differences are those necessitated by the ice sled and the athlete. The first set of international rules was created in 1990 and were drafted from Canadian rules. The only penalty unique to sledge hockey is Teeing‚Äîthe act of charging an opponent using any part of the front radius of the sled. Players with limited mobility in their arms are permitted the use of an able-bodied assistant. Pushers must wear a team jersey and safety equipment, and cannot exceed the speed of the average player on the ice nor can they enter the \\"house\\" (the area extending from the goal crease to the end-zone faceoff dots, extended to the top of the faceoff circles) while in the defensive zone. Games are divided into three 15-minute periods, followed by overtime (and if still tied after the overtime period, a shootout) if there is a tie at the end of regulation  See also  * Para ice hockey at the Winter Paralympics * World Para Ice Hockey Championships * IPC Ice Sledge Hockey European Championships * British Sledge Hockey Association, the governing body for the sport in the U.K. * USA Warriors, a Para ice hockey team consisting of combat-wounded U.S. soldiers * Power hockey, electric wheelchair hockey * Ice sledge racing, a sport that uses the same sticks and sledges for racing instead of hockey  References  *Canadian National Men's Sledge Hockey Team.

As a result, it was both considerably faster than the IBM PC and had a much better quality text display compared to an IBM PC equipped with graphics. Like the earlier Compaq Portable, its hardware and BIOS were 100% compatible with the IBM PC Model 5150 (a characteristic that few other PC workalikes shared so soon after the establishment of the IBM standard). In 1985, Compaq released the Deskpro 286, which looks quite similar to the IBM PC/AT. Then in September 1986, the Deskpro 386 was launchedhttps://dfarq.homeip.net/compaq-deskpro-386/ after Intel released its 80386 microprocessor, beating IBM by 7 months on their comparable 386 computer, and thus making a name for themselves.

He was born in Buffalo, New York, and grew up in Los Angeles, attending Los Angeles High School remaining in L.A. for his entire career. He first came to notice when he performed Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto at age 12, with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. The scheduled performer had fallen ill, and Pennario's piano playing had come to the attention of the conductor Eugene Goossens, who recommended him as the soloist after being assured by Pennario that he knew the work. In fact, he had never seen the music or even heard it, but he learned it in a week. He studied with Guy Maier, Olga Steeb, and Isabelle Vengerova and attended the University of Southern California, where he studied composition with Ernst Toch. World War II interrupted his career, and he served in the U.S. Army Air Forces in the China Burma India Theater, where his piano skills were soon realized and served well entertaining troops of the Air Transport Command operation known as \\"The Hump\\". He occasionally had to play around keys missing from the keyboards of the pianos at a couple of the more remote bases. He was discharged in 1946 as a staff sergeant and was awarded three Battle Stars. He had, however, made his debut, in uniform, with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall on November 17, 1943, with Artur Rodzi≈Ñski, playing Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1. Shortly after Sergei Rachmaninoff's death, the conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos invited Leonard Pennario to be the soloist at a memorial concert, playing the Second Piano Concerto with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. Pennario became the first pianist after the composer himself to record all four Rachmaninoff piano concertos and the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. His recording of the Rachmaninoff 2nd Concerto was used for the film September Affair (1950), in which Joan Fontaine plays a concert pianist preparing to play the concerto. Beginning in the 1960s, he played in a renowned trio with the violinist Jascha Heifetz and the cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa wrote a piano concerto for Pennario, and he was the soloist in the first performance, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta. Pennario recorded over 60 LPs, most of them of composers dating from Chopin and later. He is perhaps best known for championing certain modern composers such as George Gershwin, Rachmaninoff, R√≥zsa, Louis Moreau Gottschalk, and Sergei Prokofiev. In 1958, he was tied with Walter Gieseking in terms of best-selling classical records involving the piano. Pennario retired from active performance and recording in the 1990s. He wrote some pieces of his own, such as Midnight on the Cliffs, March of the Lunatics, and a 4-hand arrangement of Chopin's Minute Waltz.Leonard Pennario, The Composer He was inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame in October 2007.Buffalo Music Hall of Fame As well as being well represented in music encyclopedias, he was a Life Master in tournament bridge, and is listed in The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge, most notably winning an Open Pairs event in China in 1991. He was once part of a celebrity foursome with Don Adams, Les Brown and Jack Benny's daughter Joan Benny. He died of complications from Parkinson's disease on June 27, 2008 at the age of 83, in La Jolla, California.Leonard Pennario, 83, Classical Pianist, Dies An authorized biography of Leonard Pennario is currently being written by Buffalo News music critic Mary Kunz Goldman.Leonard Pennario publicist and authorized biographer Sources *see Leonard Pennario home page for additional information including complete discography  References  External links * * Category:1924 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:American male pianists Category:American male composers Category:American contract bridge players Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:Musicians from Buffalo, New York Category:People from Los Angeles Category:Thornton School of Music alumni Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:20th-century American pianists Category:20th-century American composers Category:Classical musicians from New York (state) Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Leonard Pennario"},{"id":"3620559","text":"Brick Breaker is a video game that came preloaded on the BlackBerry, and is now available on App Store (iOS). Gameplay Brick Breaker (platformer) is a Breakout clonewhich the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the BlackBerry's trackwheel, the computer's mouse or the touch of a finger (in the case of touchscreen). The player gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level. There are 34 levels. Many levels have unbreakable silver bricks. If all lives are lost, the game is over. There are many versions of brick breaker, some in which you can shoot flaming fireballs or play with more than one ball if the player gets a power up. Critical reception Brick Breaker has a cult following of professional players trying to achieve high scores.

From 1962 to 1964, Ross was replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. History The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for ABC-Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959). Sing a Song of Basie was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. They recorded a version of Ross's 1952 song \\"Twisted\\", featuring her lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody. Their High Flying album won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The band was renamed Lambert, Hendricks and Bavan and made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival, and their performances of \\"Comin' Home\\" and \\"Moanin'\\" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's death in a road accident in Connecticut in 1966. In 2012, No One But Me, a documentary film about Annie Ross, featured contributions from Hendricks and contained footage of the duo reuniting for a performance. Jon Hendricks died on November 22, 2017. Annie Ross died on July 21, 2020. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Lambert, Hendricks & Ross among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

A wide, legible design that is slightly bolder than most body text faces, Bookman has been used for both display typography and for printing at small sizes such as in trade printing, and less commonly for body text. In advertising use it is particularly associated with the graphic design of the 1960s and 1970s, when revivals of it were very popular. Bookman evolved from fonts known as Old Style Antique, which are bold derivatives of the \\"Modernised Old Style\\" design created by Alexander Phemister around the 1850s for the Miller & Richard foundry. These have letterforms similar to those of the eighteenth-century typeface Caslon, with a more even and regular structure, a wide and tall lower-case, and little contrast in line width. Bookman is much bolder than the original Modernised Old Style, to which it was intended to be a bold complement, almost to the point of being a slab serif. The 1924 textbook Introduction to Advertising describes Bookman as \\"simple, masculine and leaves the impression of reliability without heaviness\\". History \\"Old Style\\". As the text says, the design was intended to capitalise on a fashion of interest in eighteenth- century \\"old style\\" designs, while offering a more delicate and regular structure reflecting how typecutting had evolved towards the Didone style since then. Bookman evolved from bolder versions of this design. Miller and Richard's Oldstyle Antique. The design is bolder but on the same basic structure. It was presumably not designed by Phemister, who had emigrated to New York in 1861 before moving to Massachusetts a few years later. The ancestor of Bookman Old Style is Miller & Richard's \\"Old Style\\", cut by Alexander Phemister. Often described as \\"modernised old style\\", it is a redesign of \\"true old-style\\" serif faces from the eighteenth century such as Caslon. Like them, it has sloping top serifs and an avoidance of abrupt contrasts in stroke widths. The lower-case letters are quite wide and the x-height (height of lower-case letters) is quite large. Widely resold and pirated, it became a standard typeface and helped to create a genre of a wide range of loose revivals and adaptations of the Caslon design, visible in the wide-spreading arms of the T and the sharp half-arrow serifs on many letters. (Ronaldson Old Style by Alexander Kay (1884) was another, as was Phemister's own later Franklin, created after he had emigrated.) The direct ancestor of Bookmans were several fonts from around 1869 named \\"Old Style Antique\\" intended as a bold complement to the original Old Style face. \\"Antique\\" was a common name given to bolder typefaces of the time, now often called slab serifs, and identifies the aim of creating a complementary bolder design on the oldstyle model for uses such as emphasis and headings. However, the old style antique fonts also became used for extended body text use. Although Old Style Antique faces were bolder than Old Style, the difference was not great enough that they could not be used for body text. G. Willem Ovink, a historian of type, writes in his history of the style in 1971 that: > A bold Old Style was needed. This was indeed produced, almost simultaneously > in Philadelphia and in Edinburgh [around 1869] in two distinct designs, both > under the name of Old Style Antique. The term 'Antique' probably refers less > to historical forms than to the boldness and the stubby serifs of the > Egyptians [slab serifs], which were also called antiques. In the 1890s, when > such faces as Caslon and Jenson had introduced the notion that all historic > romans were bold, their colour and old-style basic forms made the old-style > Antiques in the words of De Vinne...'now often used as fair substitutes for > older styles of text types,' regardless of their unhistoric origin. The > course of development is difficult to trace.\\" An Old Style Antique in a Roycroft Press edition of 'Sonnets from the Portuguese' by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 1898. The Roycroft Press used the family extensively. Alexander Lawson describes this as being intended by founder Elbert Hubbard to copy the dark style of impression favoured by William Morris' Kelmscott Press. It was used by at least one printer around the time period for the same reason. Ward also suggests that \\"its heavy, almost equally weighted lines seemed to go well with the heavy lines of arts and crafts woodcuts.\\" These designs were then copied and bought up by a series of American type foundries, according to Ovink in a mixture of sizes based on the Philadelphia and Edinburgh designs. (During the period many fonts once created were copied by other foundries, in some cases probably illegally by electrotyping, making the evolution of styles complicated to track.) Ovink describes the \\"Philadelphia\\" Oldstyle Antique as being different for being slightly less bold and having an 'a' with a rounded top and a 'T' with slight curves on top. Theodore De Vinne wrote of the style in 1902 that it was \\"in marked favour as a text letter for books intended to have more of legibility.\\" As Ovink notes, Old Style Antique was used by historically minded printers to emulate the solid style of fifteenth-century typefaces, and in particular to emulate the custom Golden Type used by William Morris at his Kelmscott Press. Printers of the period noted the confusion of the apparently tautologous name, one saying that it reminded him of a joke about a man who ordered caf√© au lait with milk. By 1903 Old Style Antique was sold by American Type Founders under the new name of Bookman Old Style, with an added 'italic'. ATF did not offer a normal italic, instead featuring an oblique, or \\"sloped roman\\", in which the letters are simply slanted. Serif typefaces which use an oblique are now quite rare, but the style was relatively common for display typefaces in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was sold with some swash capitals and other letters. Although one critic described its swash letters in 1913 as \\"ridiculous\\", they would become a popular feature of revivals and derivatives. A specimen of Linotype Bookman. Bookman was popular in twentieth-century American printing for its solid colour, wide characters and legibility: one 1946 review commented that it \\"can stand a lot of mauling\\". Fine printers and those more interested in the pre-nineteenth century typefaces from which it descended, however, were less impressed by it, finding it dull for its wide, large lower-case and lack of elegance. It was most popular in the USA: by the mid-twentieth century, all the Modernised Old Styles had become almost totally eclipsed in British printing except as a backup choice, partly as a result of the dominance of the British Monotype Corporation's extremely successful and well-promoted series of book faces and Linotype's similar series. While John Betjeman liked the design for its association with hymn-books, and used it in several of his books to evoke this atmosphere, the slightly younger Philip Larkin described its use in a review of Betjeman's autobiography Summoned By Bells in terms suggesting that he found its use archaic and somewhat ridiculous. In 1950 Monotype's marketing manager Beatrice Warde told an audience of Canadian printers that Bookman had not \\"been used in England in 20 years.\\" One 1959 British study of typefaces - albeit one connected to Monotype and carried out by the controversial Cyril Burt, later accused of fabricating research - described Monotype's Oldstyle Antique as \\"seldom used for ordinary book work\\" and treated it as a design most appropriate for books for children under 12. Chauncey H. Griffith of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company developed a revival for Linotype's hot metal typesetting system (which was named \\"Bookman\\"), and Monotype also offered one. (Linotype's has been digitised by Bitstream based on its design from this period form, making it one of the few digital versions not based on post-war versions.) Other Old Style Antique releases were common in American printing during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Old Style Antique in a Roycroft edition of Robert Browning. Phototypesetting period Meola's Bookman, showing its extremely large range of ostentatious swash characters. Many Bookman revivals appeared for phototypesetting systems in the 1960s and 1970s, often including an extensive repertoire of swash characters, meaning that the design is commonly associated with the graphic design of the period. These large character repertoires took advantage of the new phototypesetting technology, which allowed characters to be stored on film or glass phototype master disks and printed at any desired size, rather than bulky metal type. Letraset created one revival during this period. The separation of type designs from the complex manufacturing process of metal type also allowed for easier cloning of typefaces, meaning that many fonts sold during the period were unauthorised copies or modifications of other companies' designs. Mark Simonson, who has designed a revival of the Bookmans of this period, has commented on the most common version used in the 1960s > I have so far been unable to find out who designed and produced it. I think > of it as the ‚ÄúSixties Bookman.‚Äù...It‚Äôs closest to the larger sizes of ATF > Bookman Oldstyle, but significantly bolder, with more contrast between the > thicks and thins than other Bookmans and with smaller serifs...I‚Äôve yet to > see a credit for the designer or maker of this version. The best theory I > have is that it was a custom font created for an ad campaign in the mid- > sixties. Someone who had access to it made copies. And before long, every > typesetting shop had it. Whatever the story is, this version of Bookman was > everywhere. I had Sixties Bookman on rub-down type sheets when I was in high > school in the early Seventies discovering type. One of the most famous results of this period is the 1975 ITC's revival from which many modern versions are descended. Type designer and lawyer Matthew Butterick has written that as a result of its use in this period Bookman 'evokes the Ford administration. If fonts were clothing, this would be the corduroy suit.' =ITC Bookman= ITC Bookman is a revival designed by Ed Benguiat in 1975, for the International Typeface Corporation. Benguiat developed a full family of four weights plus complementary cursive designs: unlike previous Bookman versions, these are true italics in which the letters take on handwriting forms. Benguiat also drew a suite of swash and alternate characters for each of the members of the family. While Bookman's x-height was quite high already, this enlarges the lower-case even more, in the fashion of the period. Fonts for swash and alternate characters were eventually released in OpenType versions of the fonts,What's Hot From ITC: January 2006 or separately as ITC Bookman Swash. ITC licensed the design to Adobe and Apple, guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the PostScript page description language as part of the Adobe PostScript 3 Font Set. (The weights licensed were Light, Light Italic, Demi, Demi Italic.) Digitisations Most digitisations of Bookman are based on the Bookman revivals of the 1960s and 1970s. An exception is Bitstream's digitisation of the Linotype Bookman of the 1930s. Because of ITC Bookman's status as a basic part of the Postscript standard, many modern Bookman revivals and variants were created as a \\"metrically identical\\" alternative, or copy it due to its popularity. These include 'Revival 711' by Bitstream, and 'BM' by Itek. =Monotype version= Monotype Bookman (inner lines) compared to samples of the original ATF Bookman (the top one from a larger point size) scaled to the same cap height. It can be seen that the modern Bookman revival has generally wider characters than the original, a somewhat higher x-height (taller lower-case letters) and several detail differences. Ovink describes the rounded 'a' as being based on the Oldstyle Antique prepared by a Philadelphia foundry, and the straight-topped 'a' as that prepared by Miller & Richard. Visible also is a compressed descender on the 'g' to allow tighter linespacing. Comparison between Monotype Bookman (above in the samples) and its ancestor Caslon (below), scaled to matching cap height. The caps are quite similar but the lower-case letters of this Bookman revival are wider and higher (a higher x-height). The current Monotype version of Bookman is called Monotype Bookman Old Style or marketed as Bookman Old Style. It was designed by Ong Chong Wah. It is based on earlier Lanston Monotype and ATF models, but again was redesigned to match the ITC version. It is bundled with many Microsoft products, making it one of the most commonly used versions of Bookman. In Monotype Bookman the italic was redrawn to be a true italic similar to ITC Bookman. Though the face's name includes the phrase 'Old Style,' the near-vertical stress of the face places it more in the transitional classification. This version include support of Cyrillic, Greek, and extended Latin characters. It was bundled with Microsoft Office products since version 4.3, except in Windows 7 Starter, and in TrueType Font Pack. A retail version of the font is also sold. swashes were often seen in 1970s graphic design, often quite tightly spaced. =Other Postscript clones= Other companies developed similar knockoff fonts matching ITC Bookman's metrics for PostScript compatibility. URW++ donated their PostScript alternative, known as URW Bookman L, to the Ghostscript project as a free software replacement for the ITC version. It was further enhanced by the Polish GUST foundry as part of their TeX Gyre project and named Bonum.http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/ =Jukebox Bookman= Jukebox Bookman is a revival of the original Bookman family, designed by Jason Walcott and published by Veer. This family includes 6 fonts, with complementary italic, and 2 swash designs for each of the roman and italic fonts. =Bookmania (2011)= Bookmania is a revival of Bookman Oldstyle and the Bookmans of the 1960s, designed by Mark Simonson. The design was started from a custom font designed by Mark Simonson back in 2006, which was based on Bookman Bold Italic with Swash, and a Bookman Bold with Swash font designed by Miller & Richard (as credited by Letraset). The italic fonts were redesigned to include optical correction. Unlike the ITC and Monotype revivals, Simonson chose to use the obliques preferred by ATF, offering true italic characters as an alternate. The family contains a large number of alternate characters, such as swashes and unicase characters. Notes References External links * ATF's 1912 specimen book.

Attributes The paper includes news stories, arts, music, book, and film coverage, an entertainment calendar, a lifestyle section, and reviews of restaurants and culture. The Independent also does investigative reporting on a variety of issues, from the environment to local politics. After the beginning of the Santa Barbara News-Press controversy in 2006, the Independent implemented Web-based columns and news articles at independent.com. The internet edition is updated daily, and more frequently during some local events, such as the 2008 Gap and Tea brush fires and the Jesusita fire in 2009. A community-alert system called IndyAlert has also been developed to send out e-mail and cell-phone messages during disasters and community emergencies.

Lawsuit Campbell tried to sell his controlling shares in the Independent in 2009 to a Los Angeles newspaper company. Partridge sued Campbell in 2010 to force the sale of shares, claiming that he had breached her right-of-first refusal. Campbell filed a cross action against financial supporter Joe Cole, former Santa Barbara News-Press publisher and former lawyer for The Independent and Campbell. Campbell's cross complaint was dismissed in 2013, and appealed later that year. A settlement was reached in early 2014. The dispute between Partridge and Campbell was tried in August, 2011. The court ruled in Partridge's favor that Campbell had breached and must sell his shares. Campbell appealed the trial court's decision. The appellate court returned the case to the trial court unchanged in April, 2013, but ordered a recalculation of the fine points of the sale price. The final judgment in 2013 confirmed Campbell's obligation to sell his shares to Partridge and ordered him to pay attorney's fees and costs, and increased the sales price with interest.

Low was born into poverty in Westminster, London, and was a thief from an early age. He moved to Boston, Massachusetts, as a young man. His wife died in childbirth in late 1719. Two years later, he became a pirate, operating off the coasts of New England and the Azores, and in the Caribbean. Low captained a number of ships, usually maintaining a small fleet of three or four. Low and his pirate crews captured at least a hundred ships during his short career, burning most of them. Although he was active for only three years, Low remains notorious as one of the most vicious pirates of the age, with a reputation for violently torturing his victims before murdering them. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described Low as \\"savage and desperate,\\" and a man of \\"amazing and grotesque brutality\\". The New York Times called him a torturer, whose methods would have \\"done credit to the ingenuity of the Spanish Inquisition in its darkest days\\". The circumstances of Low's death, which took place around 1724, have been the subject of much speculation. Early life According to Charles Johnson's A General History of the Pyrates, Edward Low was born in Westminster, London, England, in 1690. Some content available on Google Books: . He was described as illiterate, having a \\"quarrelsome nature\\", and always ready to cheat, running \\"wild in the streets of his native parish\\". Some content available on Google Books: . As a young man, he was said to be a pickpocket and gambler, playing games of chance with the footmen of the nearby House of Commons. Most of his family appear to have been thieves. While young, his brother, Richard, was small for his age and is said to have been carried around in a basket on a friend's back; in a crowd, Richard would snatch the hats and wigs of passers-by. Richard later took to other forms of criminal activity and ended up hanged at Tyburn in 1707 for the burglary of a house in Stepney. Life in Boston As he advanced in age, Low tired of pickpocketing and thievery and turned to burglary. Eventually, he left England, and traveled alone to the New World around 1710. He spent three to four years in various locations, before settling in Boston, Massachusetts. On 12 August 1714, he married Eliza Marble at the First Church of Boston. They had a son, who died when he was an infant, and then a daughter named Elizabeth, born in the winter of 1719. Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low with his daughter. The loss of his wife had a profound effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press- gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston. Low was employed as a patron, supervising the loading and carrying of the logs. One day, he returned to the ship when hungry, but was told by the captain he would have to wait to eat, and that he and his men would have to be satisfied with a ration of rum. At this, Low \\"took up a loaded musket and fired at the captain but missed him, [and] shot another poor fellow through the throat\\". Following this failed mutiny, Low and his friends were forced to leave the boat. A day later, Low led the twelve-man gang‚Äîwhich included Francis Farrington Spriggs, who went on to become a notorious pirate in his own right‚Äîin taking over a small sloop off the coast of Rhode Island. Killing one man during the theft, Low and his crew turned pirate, determined \\"to go in her, make a black Flag, and declare War against all the World.\\" Piracy =First mate= Low, using his newly captured ship, lay in wait on the popular shipping route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island and plundered it. His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm. He then captured a number of unarmed merchantmen near Port Rosemary. Low headed south and began operating in the waters of Grand Cayman, with a period as lieutenant to the established pirate George Lowther, who captained the Happy Delivery, a 100-ton Rhode Island sloop with eight cannon and ten swivel guns. When she was \\"destroyed by Indians\\", Lowther and his crew transferred to a sloop named the Ranger. Lowther's crew was constantly expanded by desperate sailors willing to join him. Fast acquiring a taste for cruelty, Low taught Spriggs a torture technique which involved tying a victim's hands with rope between their fingers and setting it alight, burning their flesh down to the bones. Following a number of successful raids, Lowther eventually captured a large 6-gun brigantine (named Rebecca) on 28 May 1722. He gave it to Low to captain. With a crew of 44, Low amicably dissolved his partnership with Lowther. =Pirate captain= In one notable raid in June 1722, Low and his crew attacked thirteen New England fishing vessels sheltering at anchor in Port Roseway, Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Although outnumbered, Low hoisted his Jolly Roger flag and declared that no mercy would be given to the fishermen if any resisted. The fleet submitted and Low's men robbed every vessel. Low chose the largest, an 80-ton schooner which he renamed The Fancy and armed with 10 guns, to become his flagship. Bibliography for data: He sank the other ships of the fleet, and abandoned the Rebecca. The Boston News-Letter of 9 July 1722 published a list of those captured by Low. Some content available on Google Books: A number of the fishermen were forced to join Low, including Philip Ashton, who escaped in May 1723 on Roat√°n Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and who wrote a detailed account of life aboard Low's pirate ship. Before Ashton's escape, he had been beaten, whipped, kept in chains, and threatened with death many times - particularly by Low's quartermaster John Russell - as he refused to sign Low's articles and become a pirate. Edward Low, Torturing a Yankee, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Low's tactics consisted primarily of hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off the coast of St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed man-of-war for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese‚Äîsources differ) pink, a narrow- sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He moved on to the Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather. Low abandoned his plans for plundering the rich shipping trade off the coast of Brazil, and moved on to the Caribbean. George Roberts, a mate on the British ship King Sagamore, recounted a meeting with Low aboard the Rose Pink. Roberts' ship was captured by Low's fleet, of which he was now styling himself \\"Commodore\\". =Capsizing of the Rose Pink= Forty leagues (120 nautical miles or around 220 km) to the east of Surinam, Low and his fleet of two ships (the Rose Pink and the Fancy, captained by a young Charles Harris) dropped anchor to remove growth such as seaweed and barnacles from the outside of the boats, in a process known as careening, necessary because no dry dock was available to pirates. Some content available on Google Books: . Still relatively inexperienced, Low ordered too many men to the outside of the boat to work on the buildup, and the Rose Pink tipped over too far. The portholes had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The Rose Pink had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low‚Äîby now captaining a captured schooner, the Squirrel‚Äîand his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint (around 275 ml) per man, per day. Failing to reach their initial destination of Tobago due to light winds and strong currents, Low's depleted fleet made it to Grenada, a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed the Ranger), gave the schooner Squirrel to Spriggs, now his quartermaster, who renamed it the Delight before sailing away in the middle of the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew. =Early 1723= Low's new fleet captured many more sloops, including one Low kept, naming it the Fortune. During a trial on 10 July 1723 for a number of Low's crew, a sailor on board the Fortune named John Welland recalled how Low stripped his boat, including gold to the value of ¬£150, then beat him and cut off his ear with a cutlass. ‚Äì recount of the trial of many of Low's men, including verdict and witness statements, and Low's articles. Following this, Low's fleet captured a Portuguese ship called the Nostra Signiora de Victoria on 25 January 1723. The Victoria's captain allowed a bag containing approximately 11,000 gold moidores (worth at the time around ¬£15,000) to fall into the sea rather than see it captured. One of Low's most noted episodes of cruelty followed: in his rage, he slashed off the Portuguese captain's lips with a cutlass, broiled them, and forced the victim to eat them while still hot. He then murdered the remaining crew. Low's own men described him as \\"a maniac and a brute\\". The Cruelties practised by Captain Low, from A Pirate's Own Book (1837) One story describes Low burning a French cook alive, saying he was a \\"greasy fellow who would fry well\\", and another tells he once killed 53 Spanish captives with his cutlass. Some historians, including David Cordingly, believe this was deliberately done to cultivate a ferocious image. Historian Edward Leslie described Low as a psychopath with a history filled with \\"mutilations, disembowelings, decapitations, and slaughter\\". Low, like other pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into surrendering by threatening to kill or torture them. The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of reprisals. Some content available at Google Books: One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred. A snow called the Unity was added to the fleet, and used as a tender, but was abandoned during an encounter with a man of war named the Mermaid. As Low's success increased in the Caribbean, so did his notoriety. Eventually, a bounty was placed on his head, and Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up with Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time. =A defeat= Low presenting a Pistol and Bowl of Punch, from A Pirate's Own Book (1837) Low, Harris and their ships left the Azores for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they suffered a resounding defeat in a battle with , a heavily armed man of war. Greyhound had been dispatched under the command of Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the Fancy with a skeleton crew and ¬£150,000 in gold on board and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the Ranger behind. Twenty-five of the crew of the Ranger, including the ship's doctor, were tried between 10 July and 12 July, with Solgard giving evidence and recounting the battle. The men were hanged for felony, piracy and robbery, near Newport, Rhode Island, on 19 July 1723. Harris was sent back to England and hanged at Execution Dock in Wapping. When Solgard returned to New York, he was presented with the freedom of the city and a gold snuffbox for his part in bringing some of Low's crew to justice. =End of Low's career= Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He captured a whaling vessel 80 miles (130 km) out at sea, and in a foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound and the loss of Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They were lucky, and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen. Heading south again, Low captured a 22-gun French ship and a large Virginian merchant vessel, the Merry Christmas, in late June 1723. Following the defeat by the Greyhound, Low became \\"peculiarly cruel\\" to his English victims. His fleet of three ships rejoined forces with George Lowther in July. In late 1723, Low and Lowther's fleet captured the Delight off the coast of Guinea, mounting fourteen guns on her, with command being given to Spriggs. Two days later, Spriggs and Lowther both abandoned Low, leaving him the Merry Christmas, by now mounted with 34 guns, as his sole ship. = Fate = There are conflicting reports on the circumstances of Low's death. Captain Charles Johnsonconsidered by some to be Daniel Defoe writing under a pseudonym‚Äîstated in his A General History of the Pyrates, at odds with other sources, that Low and the Fancy were last sighted near the Canaries and Guinea. However, at the time of his 1724 book, no further reports had surfaced. He noted one rumour that Low was sailing for Brazil and another that Low's ship sank in a storm with the loss of all hands. The National Maritime Museum in London states that he was never caught, ending his days in Brazil. The Pirates Own Book and Ossian both suggest that Low was set adrift without provisions by the crew of the Merry Christmas, in a mutiny brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument. His crew elected Captain Shipton to command the Merry Christmas; they would go on to sail alongside Spriggs in the Caribbean. Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in Martinique in 1724. Flags Artist's impression of Low's initial flag Artist's impression of the pirate flag used by Low Artist's impression of the Green Trumpeter flag used by Low Initially, Low used the same flag as Edward Teach (\\"Blackbeard\\"). Later, he used his own flag, a red skeletal figure on a black background, which became notorious. He first flew his own flag in late July 1723. Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet; this Green Trumpeter was hoisted on the mizzen peak to call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship. Articles Low had a set of Articles, a code of conduct and an ironic reference to the Royal Navy's own Articles of War. The Articles listed below are attributed to Low by The Boston News-Letter. The first eight of these articles are essentially identical to those attributed to Lowther by Charles Johnson. It is likely that both reports are correct and that Low and Lowther shared the same articles, with Low's two extra articles being an ordonnance, or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated. Legacy Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride at Disneyland Edward Low's acts, along with those of other pirates of the period such as Edward \\"Blackbeard\\" Teach, Bartholomew \\"Black Bart\\" Roberts, and William Fly, led to a great increase in the military presence to protect shipping lanes, resulting in the effective end of the Golden Age of Piracy. By 1700, the European states had enough troops and ships at their disposal, following the end of a number of wars, to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of privateers. Pirates based in the Caribbean were chased from the seas by a new British squadron based at Port Royal, Jamaica, and a smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the Spanish Main, known as the Guarda de Costa, or simply the Guarda. Less is recorded of Low than of other equally prolific pirates such as Teach and Stede Bonnet. Howard Pyle, in an 1880 children's book on pirates, said: \\"No one stood higher in the trade than [Low], and no one mounted to more lofty altitudes of bloodthirsty and unscrupulous wickedness. 'Tis strange that so little has been written and sung of this man of might, for he was as worthy of story and of song as was Blackbeard.\\" Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his work The Green Flag, described Low as \\"savage and desperate\\", and a man of \\"amazing and grotesque brutality\\". The New York Times said \\"Low and his crew became the terror of the Atlantic, and his depredations were committed on every part of the ocean, from the coast of Brazil to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland\\". A 1936 Pac-Kups Jolly Roger Pirate card featuring an artist's impression of Edward Low Low has featured on stamps and commemorative currency around the Caribbean. A postage stamp featuring Low was commissioned by the Cayman Islands in 1975,Scott catalogue, volume II and in 1994 the government of Antigua and Barbuda featured Low and his brigantine, Rebecca, on a legal tender one hundred-dollar bill made of gold leaf. \\"Ned Low\\" is one of the pirates featured on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at the Disneyland theme park in California. A duplicate of Low's flag was used for the flag of the fictional pirate Sao Feng in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean films. Ned Low was played by Tadhg Murphy in the Starz TV series Black Sails. Some of Low's haunts, such as the waters around the Isles of Shoals off New Hampshire and Isle Haute in Nova Scotia, attract treasure hunters who seek artifacts in the ships he sank.

Founded in 1941, it is home to both permanent and special collections, the former of which includes Asian, American, and European art that spans 4,000 years from ancient to modern. History Santa Barbara Museum of Art, ca. 1941. Santa Barbara Museum of Art Archives. The Santa Barbara Museum of Art opened to the public on June 5, 1941, in a building that was at one time the Santa Barbara Post Office (1914‚Äì1932). The idea for an art museum first came from the local artist Colin Campbell Cooper when he learned that the post office was going to be sold. In a letter to the editor published in the Santa Barbara News-Press in July 1937, Cooper proposed that the impressive Italianate structure should be transformed into a museum. After gaining momentum in town and with the support of local businesses, politicians and art collectors the Santa Barbara Museum of Art was officially established just four years after Cooper's letter was published. The renowned Chicago architect David Adler was hired to simplify the building's fa√ßade and create the Museum's first galleries including: Ludington Court, Thayer Gallery, von Romberg Gallery, Campbell Gallery and Gould Gallery. One of the Museum's key founders, Wright S. Ludington, was instrumental in its formation and was active with the Museum for over 50 years even serving as its president in the early 1950s. Most importantly, however, Ludington donated nearly 400 objects to the Museum's permanent collection including Ancient Greek and Roman antiquities, Ancient Chinese sculptures, as well as work from modern artists including Henri Matisse, Edgar Degas, Joseph Stella, Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro. Over its history the Museum has expanded with the addition of the Stanley B. McCormick Gallery donated by his wife Katharine McCormick in 1942 and the Sterling and Preston Morton Galleries in 1963. Significant expansions came when the Alice Keck Park Wing opened to the public in 1985 and the Jean and Austin H. Peck, Jr. Wing in 1998. The Ridley-Tree Education Center at McCormick House, a center for art education activities, was established in 1991. The newly renovated Park Wing Entrance and Luria Activities Center opened in June 2006. Beginning in Summer 2016, the SBMA embarked on the largest renovation in its history addressing critical needs of the building including: seismic retrofitting, new storage and conservation space, new roof and mechanical systems, new art receiving facility and an increase in overall gallery space. Today, the Museum's 60,000 square feet include exhibition galleries, a Museum Store, Caf√©, a 154-seat auditorium, a library containing 50,000 books and 55,000 slides, a Family Resource Center dedicated to participatory interactive programming and an 11,500-square-foot off-site facility, the Ridley-Tree Education Center at McCormick House. Permanent Collection SBMA's permanent collection includes more than 27,000 works of art, including paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, photographs, ceramics, glass, jades, bronzes, lacquer and textiles. These works represent the arts of Asia, Europe and the Americas spanning over 5,000 years of human history. Particular strengths of the permanent collection include: *19th- century French art (Barbizon School, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism) *19th and 20th-century American art (paintings and works on paper) *Contemporary Regional art (20th-century and 21st-century California artists to the present) *Western Pacific Rim photography (contemporary Chinese, Japanese, Korean) *Buddhist art (Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, Indian) Exhibitions SBMA presents shows of art and artists of the past, such as Degas, Leonardo, Picasso, Rothko, and Van Gogh, and of artists of recent years.

An outstanding example of Palladian architecture in North America and the only plantation house on the Ashley River to survive intact through both the Revolutionary and Civil wars, it is a National Historic Landmark. When photographed by George LaGrange Cook in about 1890, Drayton Hall's two flanker buildings were still extant. The mansion was built for the father of John Drayton, John Drayton Sr. (c. 1715‚Äì1779) after he bought the property in 1738.\\"Seven Generations of the Drayton Family: From the Colonial Period to Modern Day\\" , Drayton Hall website As the third son in his family, he knew he was unlikely to inherit his own nearby birthplace, now called Magnolia Plantation and Gardens. The John Drayton House at 2 Ladson St. in downtown Charleston, South Carolina was built after 1746 by John Drayton, the builder of Drayton Hall, and shows his preference for the Georgian Palladian style. For many decades, the house was thought to have been begun in 1738 and completed in 1752. In 2014, an examination of wood cores showed that the attic timbers were cut from trees felled in the winter of 1747‚Äì48. Because the attic framing would have to have been in place well before the completion of the interior finishes, the house is now thought to have been occupied only in the early 1750s. The seven-bay double-pile plantation house is within a site that is part of the plantation based on indigo and rice and the former site of 13 slave cabins believed to have housed approx. 78 slaves. Seven generations of Drayton heirs preserved the house in all but original condition, though the flanking outbuildings have not survived: an earthquake destroyed the laundry house in 1886 and a hurricane destroyed the kitchen in 1893.\\"Drayton Hall\\", South Carolina Plantations, SCIway John Drayton bought considerable property nearby from his nephew William Drayton, Sr., after the latter was appointed as chief justice of the Province of East Florida in the early 1770s and was leaving South Carolina. John Drayton consolidated the various Drayton properties, and his descendants have controlled them since. Description The house has a double projecting (and recessed) portico on the west facade, which faces away from the river and toward the land side approach from Ashley River Road. The double projecting portico resembles a similar feature at Villa Cornaro, a country estate near Venice, Italy, designed by Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio in 1551. The floor plan of Drayton Hall is Palladian as well, perhaps derived from Plate 38 of James Gibbs' A Book of Architecture,James Gibbs, A Book of Architecture, containing designs of buildings and ornaments (London, 1728; repr. New York, 2008), . the influential patternbook published in London in 1728.Carl I. Gable, \\"Searching for Sources: What are Drayton Hall's Palladian Roots?\\" Palladiana: Journal of the Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., vol. 4, no. 1 (Fall 2009), p. 5. A large central entrance stair hall with a symmetrical divided staircase is backed by a large saloon, flanked by square and rectangular chambers.Drayton Hall Pedimented chimneypieces in the house are in the tectonic manner popularized by William Kent. There is fine plasterwork in several of the rooms of the main floor, which is set above a raised basement. Located on SC 61 and included in the Ashley River Historic District, it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. and The South Carolina Department of Archives and History claims that Drayton Hall is \\"without question one of the finest of all surviving plantation houses in America\\". Drayton Hall is owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and managed by the Drayton Hall Preservation Trust, which opened the house to the public in 1976. It presents a full interpretation of the historic plantation economy as exemplified by the Draytons, both white and black. African slaves and free blacks created the Gullah culture of the Lowcountry. The first guide to the house, Drayton Hall, was published in 2005.  Image Gallery  Drayton Hall Interior.jpgThe interior details of Drayton Hall.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. and  Construction and revenue use  In 1910, with Robert Todd Lincoln as the company president, the Pullman Car Company suddenly changed from the 60 foot varnished wood railroad cars to the 80 foot, riveted-steel design. The new technology of the time was electric lighting, so the new cars required the addition of electrical wiring, switches, switchboards, generators, and batteries. Wood and steel trucks were replaced with massive structural steel castings. It was September of this year that coach 895 was manufactured for the Western Pacific Railroad (WP) at an original cost of $13,624.50. The car was configured as an 84-seat coach and was the culmination of the most modern design and construction of heavyweight steel cars from the Pullman Company. Pullman passenger cars such as the WP 895 were the ultimate in travel prior to World War I. On January 11, 1924, coach 895 became Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG;) number 926. At that time, its book value was given at $8,783.90. In 1929, the railroad car was rebuilt by the D&RG; in their Burnham shops, Denver, Colorado, to a self-contained business car for the president of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW;). Numbered D&RG; 101, it was complete with staterooms, office, bathrooms, observation room, kitchen, dining room, and porter's compartment. At this time, the 101 was refitted with six-wheel trucks (estimated book value of $580.65). The (used) 1910 trucks were from one of the three buffet-library cars originally built for the Western Pacific, which were renumbered 981, 982, and 984 in 1915-16. These buffet-library cars were moved to a lower service as D&RGW; baggage cars 741, 742, and 744, and their six-wheel trucks replaced with two-axle trucks in 1929. Four of these trucks are the ones that found their way to the D&RG; Car 101 and its sister car, the 102. The rebuild cost $33,294.22 in December 1929 is when it received its present design and floor plan. At 190,000 pounds, the D&RG; Business Car 101 was the pride and status symbol of the powerful and elite in the business world, but within two weeks of its unveiling, the stock market crash of 1929 brought reality back into perspective. The 101 was built and initially assigned to the president of the D&RGW; and is a unique example of rail cars at the turn of the century. It has survived almost a hundred years as a rare example of \\"state of the art\\" 1910 railroad technology. The interior was distinguished by its hand crafted satin walnut lightly accented with bronze hardware and richly tailored fabrics.  Retirement and restoration  In September 1964, the car was retired and sold to Golden West Rail Tours. At this time, it had a book value of $47,659.60, and accrued depreciation of $44,409.60, for a net value of $3, 250. The car was later sold for scrap value. In 1983 the car was purchased by Mr. Curtis Andrews and transported from Los Angeles to Tucson, Arizona, for eight months of mechanical rebuilding to make it certified for Amtrak use. The mechanical restoration included purchase and installation of newer (1945) trucks to replace the three-axle 1910 trucks which had been installed in the 1929 upgrade. These newer style integral cast trucks were once used under a US Army hospital car. The car also received a new brake system for its six axles and a 45-page engineering analysis. After rebuilding in Arizona, the car traveled to Spokane, Washington, via Amtrak and the final leg from Spokane to Bruce, Washington, a railroad siding and industrial site just east of Othello. The tradition of numbering this class of railroad cars had changed to giving the cars names, so this car was renamed the Abraham Lincoln. The Abraham Lincoln's antiquated elegance is not only rare, but it is also the oldest operational car in America. While one of only a handful of heavyweight steel Pullman Cars left in the United States, this attests to the knowledge of the early steel engineers, the attitude to make something last, and the desire for quality. This car is named in honor of President Abraham Lincoln and should not be confused with the first private car in America, which was built for President Lincoln as a means to unite the nation after the civil war. Lincoln's private car was used for his funeral train in 1865, leaving Washington on April 21, 1865, and arriving in Springfield, Illinois, on May 3. Lincoln's funeral car was destroyed by fire in 1911 shortly after this car (as the Western Pacific coach 895) went into service. Quite by coincidence, the D&RG; 101 had been built 101 years after President Lincoln was born. The extensive restoration of the Abraham Lincoln has returned it to the simple elegance of the 1920s. In July 1988, the Abraham Lincoln was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which records the tangible reminders of the history of the United States and is the official list of the nation's cultural resources worthy of preservation.

His name is preserved in the name of Goffstown, New Hampshire and the Goffe's Falls neighborhood of Manchester, New Hampshire.  Biography  Goffe was the son of John Goffe, the town clerk of Londonderry, New Hampshire, and Hannah Parrish of what is now Nashua, New Hampshire. His grandfather, also named John Goffe, emigrated to New England in 1662 or 1663. Goffe was born in Boston in 1701 and baptized in the Old North Church under the ministry of Increase Mather. As a young man, he was a hunter and trapper in the woods of New Hampshire. He married Hannah Griggs of Roxbury, Massachusetts, on October 16, 1722, with whom he had a family of eight daughters and one son. = Service in the Colonial Wars = On April 16, 1725, Goffe was with Captain John Lovewell on his third and final expedition against the Abenaki during Dummer's War. He was left with a small garrison at a fort built at Ossipee before Lovewell's Fight near the Abenaki village of Pequewket (within the present town of Fryeburg, Maine). In 1734, Goffe and his family moved to Derryfield, New Hampshire, now named Manchester. In 1744, during King George's War, he became a captain of scouts (snowshoe men) and led a company protecting the frontier of New Hampshire from Indian attack. In 1744, he built a saw mill and a grist mill in Bedford, New Hampshire. At the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, Goffe rejoined the New Hampshire Militia and served in Joseph Blanchard's Regiment. He saw action at the battles of Lake George, Fort William Henry, Carillon, Ticonderoga and Montreal, during which time he rose to the rank of colonel and became the commander of the New Hampshire Provincial Regiment. In 1760, while en route to Crown Point, the regiment completed work begun in the fall of 1759 by Major Hawks on the Crown Point Military Road, from Fort at Number 4 in present-day Charlestown, New Hampshire, to the northernmost Black River Pond (Lake Amherst). After the war, Goffe became the commander the Ninth New Hampshire Militia Regiment. = American Revolution = Though too old (74) at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War to take command of troops in the field, Goffe was an avid revolutionary, serving in the provincial legislature and becoming the first probate judge for Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. Before dying, he also witnessed the creation of the United States. Goffe is buried at the old graveyard in Bedford, New Hampshire. In popular culture Goffe and his mill are mentioned in episode \\"Manchester Part I\\" of the television series The West Wing.

Early life and family Duraiappah was born on 15 June 1926. He was the son of an ice and aerated water manufacturer from Vannarpannai in northern Ceylon. He was educated at St. John's College, Jaffna. After school he joined Ceylon Law College, graduating as a proctor. Duraiappah married Parameswary, daughter of Cumaraswamy. They had a daughter Rochana (Eesha). Duraiappah was a Christian. Duraiappah's nephew Nishan Duraiappah is the chief of Peel Regional Police in Ontario, Canada. Career Duraiappah was elected to Jaffna Municipal Council and became its deputy mayor at the age of 23. He served as mayor from 1970 to 1975. Duraiappah stood as an independent candidate in Jaffna at the March 1960 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament. He was re- elected at the July 1960 parliamentary election but lost out to the All Ceylon Tamil Congress candidate G. G. Ponnambalam at the 1965 parliamentary election. He tried to re-gain his seat at the 1970 parliamentary election but was defeated by the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi candidate C. X. Martyn. Duraiappah was a member of the governing Sri Lanka Freedom Party and its chief organiser in Jaffna District. Tamil militants considered Duraiappah to be a traitor and government collaborator. In February 1971 Tamil militant Pon Sivakumaran tried to assassinate Duraiappah by throwing a hand grenade on to Duraiappah‚Äôs car which was parked on Second Cross Road in Jaffna. Duraiappah was not inside the car at the time. =Assassination= On 27 July 1975 Duraiappah and his daughter Eesha went to the Varadaraja Perumal Temple (Maha Vishnu Temple) in Ponnalai for their weekly worship in the Peugeot 404 which had been given to Duraiappah by his supporters. As they arrived at the temple, Duraiappah was shot dead by masked men. Some members of his family believed that Posts and Telecommunications Minister Chelliah Kumarasuriar, Duraiappah's political rival, was behind the assassination. However, his assassination was widely blamed on the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and its leader V. Prabhakaran. On 25 April 1978 the LTTE issued an open letter, which was published in the Virakesari, claiming responsibility for the assassination of eleven people including Duraiappah. The Duraiappah Stadium in Jaffna was named after him.

The user controls one of five anthropomorphic dominoes, placing other dominoes in rows that will successfully topple while avoiding obstacles and working under a time limit. Gameplay The game includes 6 stages: a casino, a grocery store, a family home, a local park, an amusement park, and a city. Each stage is set up like a racetrack as the character will go back to the starting point after each lap. The player can make as many laps as needed to clear a given stage. When the level is cleared, the player will proceed to the next stage. Once a stage starts, the character will start to run, and he/she will not stop running. To control the character's speed and where he runs, the player dictates movement with the D-Pad. The characters that are not under the player's control will attempt to hinder the avatar's progress in ways such as throwing dice, turning on electrical wire, and making fruit appear out of nowhere; making the evasion of such obstacles a primary concern of the player. A game element called a \\"trick tile\\", places the dominoes effectively by input of the Circle, X, Triangle, or Square button. This will place a domino on the current path. The player can continue to keep placing dominoes by holding down one of the aforementioned buttons. When a full lap is completed around the stage and returned to where the first domino was laid, the character will bump into the domino. The dominoes will begin an effect of inertia, and the character will stand still while the dominoes are falling. While active, the character's stamina will decrease. This is signified by the character's body gradually darkening. If the character's stamina is depleted, the character will transform into an ordinary domino, and the game will end. This is prevented by encountering special Recovery Tiles that can recover the character's stamina, but can only be used once for each tile. The player clears a stage by activation of the required number of trick tiles for each stage.

These instructions can be simple or complicated, and can be sent to either a broker or directly to a trading venue via direct market access. There are some standard instructions for such orders. Market order A market order is a buy or sell order to be executed immediately at the current market prices. As long as there are willing sellers and buyers, market orders are filled. Market orders are used when certainty of execution is a priority over the price of execution. A market order is the simplest of the order types. This order type does not allow any control over the price received. The order is filled at the best price available at the relevant time. In fast-moving markets, the price paid or received may be quite different from the last price quoted before the order was entered.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \\"Market Order\\". A market order may be split across multiple participants on the other side of the transaction, resulting in different prices for some of the shares. It is the most basic of all orders and therefore, they incur the lowest of commissions, from both online and traditional brokers. Limit order A limit order is an order to buy a security at no more than a specific price, or to sell a security at no less than a specific price (called \\"or better\\" for either direction). This gives the trader (customer) control over the price at which the trade is executed; however, the order may never be executed (\\"filled\\").U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \\"Limit Order\\". Limit orders are used when the trader wishes to control price rather than certainty of execution. A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower. For example, if an investor wants to buy a stock, but doesn't want to pay more than $20 for it, the investor can place a limit order to buy the stock at $20. By entering a limit order rather than a market order, the investor will not buy the stock at a higher price, but, may get fewer shares than he wants or not get the stock at all. A sell limit order is analogous; it can only be executed at the limit price or higher. A limit order that can be satisfied by orders in the limit book when it is received is marketable. For example, if a stock is asked for $86.41 (large size), a buy order with a limit of $90 can be filled right away. Similarly, if a stock is bid $86.40, a sell order with a limit of $80 will be filled right away. A limit order may be partially filled from the book and the rest added to the book. Both buy and sell orders can be additionally constrained. Two of the most common additional constraints are fill or kill (FOK) and all or none (AON). FOK orders are either filled completely on the first attempt or canceled outright, while AON orders stipulate that the order must be filled with the entire number of shares specified, or not filled at all. If it is not filled, it is still held on the order book for later execution. Time in force A day order or good for day order (GFD) (the most common) is a market or limit order that is in force from the time the order is submitted to the end of the day's trading session.New York Stock Exchange, \\"NYSE Order Types\\". For stock markets, the closing time is defined by the exchange. For the foreign exchange market, this is until 5 p.m. EST/EDT for all currencies except the New Zealand Dollar. Good-til-cancelled (GTC) orders require a specific cancelling order, which can persist indefinitely (although brokers may set some limits, for example, 90 days). Immediate or cancel (IOC) orders are immediately executed or cancelled by the exchange. Unlike FOK orders, IOC orders allow for partial fills. Fill or kill (FOK) orders are usually limit orders that must be executed or cancelled immediately. Unlike IOC orders, FOK orders require the full quantity to be executed. Most markets have single-price auctions at the beginning (\\"open\\") and the end (\\"close\\") of regular trading. Some markets may also have before-lunch and after-lunch orders. An order may be specified on the close or on the open, then it is entered in an auction but has no effect otherwise. There is often some deadline, for example, orders must be in 20 minutes before the auction. They are single-price because all orders, if they transact at all, transact at the same price, the open price and the close price respectively. Combined with price instructions, this gives market on close (MOC), market on open (MOO), limit on close (LOC), and limit on open (LOO). For example, a market-on-open order is guaranteed to get the open price, whatever that may be. A buy limit- on-open order is filled if the open price is lower, not filled if the open price is higher, and may or may not be filled if the open price is the same. Regulation NMS (Reg NMS),https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-52196.pdf which applies to U.S. stock exchanges, supports two types of IOC orders, one of which is Reg NMS compliant and will not be routed during an exchange sweep, and one that can be routed to other exchanges.https://www.nyse.com/pdfs/RegNMSOrderTypes.pdfhttp://apps.nyse.com/commdata/pub19b4.nsf/docs/6E26500C05868FCB852572290060AD71/$FILE/NYSE-2006-86.pdf Optimal order routing is a difficult problem that cannot be addressed with the usual perfect market paradigm. Liquidity needs to be modeled in a realistic wayVassilis Polimenis, \\"A Realistic Model of Market Liquidity and Depth\\" (2005) Journal of Futures Markets, 25 (5), pp. 443-464 if we are to understand such issues as optimal order routing and placement.Vassilis Polimenis, \\"Slow and Fast Markets\\", Journal of Economics and Business, Volume 57, Issue 6, \\"Transparency and Market Microstructure\\", November‚ÄìDecember 2005, pp. 576‚Äì593. The Order Protection (or Trade Through) Rule (Rule 611) was designed to improve intermarket price priority for quotations that are immediately and automatically accessible, but its role in predatory trading behavior has faced mounting controversy in the recent years. Conditional orders A conditional order is any order other than a limit order which is executed only when a specific condition is satisfied. =Stop orders= Stop loss order A stop order, also referred to as a stop-loss order, is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price of the stock reaches a specified price, known as the stop price. When the stop price is reached, a stop order becomes a market order. A buy‚Äìstop order is entered at a stop price above the current market price. Investors generally use a buy stop order to limit a loss or to protect a profit on a stock that they have sold short. A sell‚Äìstop order is entered at a stop price below the current market price. Investors generally use a sell‚Äìstop order to limit a loss or to protect a profit on a stock that they own.https://www.sec.gov/answers/stopord.htm When the stop price is reached, and the stop order becomes a market order, this means the trade will definitely be executed, but not necessarily at or near the stop price, particularly when the order is placed into a fast-moving market, or if there is insufficient liquidity available relative to the size of the order. The use of stop orders is much more frequent for stocks and futures that trade on an exchange than those that trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.https://www.sec.gov/answers/stopord.htm The exact mechanism of a stop order may vary between brokers and software platforms. For instance, Charles Schwab defines a stop order as follows:http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/research_strategies/market_insight/investing_strategies/stocks/order_types_what_they_mean_and_how_theyre_handled.html?cmsid=P-1005668&lvl1;=research_strategies&lvl2;=market_insight&#stopOrder Stop orders and stop-limit orders are very similar, the primary difference being what happens once the stop price is triggered. A standard sell-stop order is triggered when the bid price is equal to or less than the stop price specified or when an execution occurs at the stop price. Sell‚Äìstop order A sell‚Äìstop order is an instruction to sell at the best available price after the price goes below the stop price. A sell‚Äìstop price is always below the current market price. For example, if an investor holds a stock currently valued at $50 and is worried that the value may drop, he/she can place a sell‚Äìstop order at $40. If the share price drops to $40, the broker sells the stock at the next available price. This can limit the investor's losses or lock in some of the investor's profits (if the stop price is at or above the purchase price). Buy‚Äìstop order A buy‚Äìstop order is typically used to limit a loss (or to protect an existing profit) on a short sale.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \\"Short Selling\\". A buy-stop price is always above the current market price. For example, if an investor sells a stock short‚Äîhoping for the stock price to go down so they can return the borrowed shares at a lower price (i.e., covering)‚Äîthe investor may use a buy stop order to protect against losses if the price goes too high. It can also be used to advantage in a declining market when you want to enter a long position close to the bottom after turnaround. Stop‚Äìlimit order A stop‚Äìlimit order is an order to buy or sell a stock that combines the features of a stop order and a limit order. Once the stop price is reached, a stop- limit order becomes a limit order that will be executed at a specified price (or better).U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \\"Stop Limit Order\\". As with all limit orders, a stop‚Äìlimit order doesn't get filled if the security's price never reaches the specified limit price. Trailing stop order A trailing stop order is entered with a stop parameter that creates a moving or trailing activation price, hence the name. This parameter is entered as a percentage change or actual specific amount of rise (or fall) in the security price. Trailing stop sell orders are used to maximize and protect profit as a stock's price rises and limit losses when its price falls. For example, a trader has bought stock ABC at $10.00 and immediately places a trailing stop sell order to sell ABC with a $1.00 trailing stop (10% of its current price). This sets the stop price to $9.00. After placing the order, ABC does not exceed $10.00 and falls to a low of $9.01. The trailing stop order is not executed because ABC has not fallen $1.00 from $10.00. Later, the stock rises to a high of $15.00 which resets the stop price to $13.50. It then falls to $13.50 ($1.50 (10%) from its high of $15.00) and the trailing stop sell order is entered as a market order. Trailing profit Trailing stop‚Äìlimit order A trailing stop‚Äìlimit order is similar to a trailing stop order. Instead of selling at market price when triggered, the order becomes a limit order. = Peg orders = To behave like a market maker, it is possible to use what are called peg orders.  Peg best  Like a real market maker, the stepper: * Uses the other side of the spread * Always jumps over the competitors order to be the best one, the first in the line The conditions are: * Price limitation, no more jumping over, unless the price moves back to its area * Step value Mid-price peg A mid-price order is an order whose limit price is continually set at the average of the \\"best bid\\" and \\"best offer\\" prices in the market. The values of the bid and offer prices used in this calculation may be either a local or national best bid and offer. They are also called Peg-to-Midpoint. Mid-price peg order types are commonly supported on alternative trading systems and dark pools, where they enable market participants to trade whereby each pays half of the bid‚Äìoffer spread, often without revealing their trading intentions to others beforehand. =Market-if-touched order= A buy market-if-touched order is an order to buy at the best available price, if the market price goes down to the \\"if touched\\" level. As soon as this trigger price is touched the order becomes a market buy order. A sell market-if-touched order is an order to sell at the best available price, if the market price goes up to the \\"if touched\\" level. As soon as this trigger price is touched the order becomes a market sell order. =One cancels other orders= One cancels other (OCO) orders are used when the trader wishes to capitalize on only one of two or more possible trading possibilities. For instance, the trader may wish to trade stock ABC at $10.00 or XYZ at $20.00. In this case, they would execute an OCO order composed of two parts: A limit order for ABC at $10.00 and a limit order for XYZ at $20.00. If ABC reaches $10.00, ABC's limit order would be executed, and the XYZ limit order would be canceled. =One sends other orders= One sends other (OSO) orders are used when the trader wishes to send a new order only when another one has been executed. For instance, the trader may wish to buy stock ABC at $10.00 then immediately try to sell it at $10.05 to gain the spread. In this case, they would execute an OSO order composed of two parts: A limit buy order for ABC at $10.00, and a limit sell order for the same stock at $10.05. If ABC reaches $10.00, ABC's limit order would be executed, and the sell limit order would be sent. In short, multiple orders are attached to a main order, and the orders are executed sequentially. =Tick-sensitive orders= An uptick is when the last (non-zero) price change is positive, and a downtick is when the last (non-zero) price change is negative. Any tick- sensitive instruction can be entered at the trader's option, for example buy on downtick, although these orders are rare. In markets where short sales may only be executed on an uptick, a short‚Äìsell order is inherently tick- sensitive. =At the opening= At the opening is an order type set to be executed at the very opening of the stock market trading day. If it wouldn't be possible to execute it as part of the first trade for the day, it would instead be cancelled.Weiss, David (2006). \\"After the Trade is Made, Processing Securities Transactions\\", Portfolio; a member of Penguin Group.  Discretionary order  A discretionary order is an order that allows the broker to delay the execution at its discretion to try to get a better price; these are sometimes called not-held orders. It is commonly added to stop loss orders and limit orders. They can be placed via a broker or an electronic trading system.  Bracket  Puts to the market a pair of two orders: For the same title, for the same direction, i.e., both to sell: * One sell order is to realize the profit * The second to lock the loss, not to get even deeper Quantity and display instructions A broker may be instructed not to display the order to the market. For example: * An \\"All-or-none\\" buy limit order is an order to buy at the specified price if another trader is offering to sell the full amount of the order, but otherwise not display the order. * A hidden (or \\"iceberg\\") order requires the broker to display only a small part of the order, leaving a large undisplayed quantity \\"below the surface\\". Electronic markets All of the above order types are usually available in modern electronic markets, but order priority rules encourage simple market and limit orders. Market orders receive highest priority, followed by limit orders. If a limit order has priority, it is the next trade executed at the limit price. Simple limit orders generally get high priority, based on a first-come-first-served rule. Conditional orders generally get priority based on the time the condition is met. Iceberg orders and dark pool orders (which are not displayed) are given lower priority. See also * Central limit order book References * \\"Different Stock Sale Types\\". Eroller.

Ranulae present as a swelling of connective tissue consisting of collected mucin from a ruptured salivary gland caused by local trauma. If small and asymptomatic further treatment may not be needed, otherwise minor oral surgery may be indicated. Signs and symptoms Ranula in a female A ranula usually presents as a translucent, blue, dome-shaped, fluctuant swelling in the tissues of the floor of the mouth. If the lesion is deeper, then there is a greater thickness of tissue separating from the oral cavity and the blue translucent appearance may not be a feature. A ranula can develop into a large lesion many centimeters in diameter, with resultant elevation of the tongue and possibly interfering with swallowing (dysphagia). The swelling is not fixed, may not show blanching, and is non-painful unless it becomes secondarily infected. The usual location is lateral to the midline, which may be used to help distinguish it from a midline dermoid cyst. A cervical ranula presents as a swelling in the neck, with or without a swelling in the mouth. In common with other mucoceles, ranulae may rupture and then cause recurrent swelling. Ranulae may be asymptomatic, although they can fluctuate rapidly in size, shrinking and swelling, making them difficult to detect. = Complications = * Infection * Repeated trauma * Bursting and reformation * Dysphagia (in the case of a large ranula) Causes Minor trauma to the floor of the mouth is thought to damage the delicate ducts that drain saliva from the sublingual gland into the oral cavity. The lesion is a mucous extravasation cyst (mucocele) of the floor of mouth, although a ranula is often larger than other mucoceles (mainly because the overlying mucosa is thicker). They can grow so large that they fill the mouth. The most usual source of the mucin spillage is the sublingual salivary gland, but ranulae may also arise from the submandibular duct or the minor salivary glands in the floor of the mouth. A cervical ranula occurs when the spilled mucin dissects its way through the mylohyoid muscle, which separates the sublingual space from the submandibular space, and creates a swelling in the neck. It may occur following rupture of a simple ranula. Rarely, ranulae may extend backwards into the parapharyngeal space.  Mechanism  The fluid within a ranula has the viscous, jellylike consistency of egg white. Diagnosis Ranula, micrograph. H&E; stain. The histologic appearance is similar to mucoceles from other locations. The spilled mucin causes a granulation tissue to form, which usually contains foamy histiocytes. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to image the lesion. A small squamous cell carcinoma obstructing the Wharton duct may require clinical examination to be distinguished from a ranula. = Criteria = * Mostly seen in young children and adolescents, both sexes are equally affected. Swelling in floor of mouth, which may be painful. Mostly unilateral, on one side of frenulum. * Shape is spherical * Size varies from 1 ‚Äì 5 cm in diameter * Color is pale blue with characteristics semi transparent appearance. * Surface is smooth and mucous membrane is mobile over the swelling. * Tenderness is absent * Fluctuation test is positive * Transillumination test is positive * Cervical lymph nodes are not enlarged. * May or may not have prolongation in the neck. =Classification= A ranula is a type of mucocele, and therefore could be classified as a disorder of the salivary glands. Usually a ranula is confined to the floor of the mouth (termed a \\"simple ranula\\"). An unusual variant is the cervical ranula (also called a plunging or diving ranula), where the swelling is in the neck rather than the floor of the mouth. The term ranula is also sometimes used to refer to other similar swellings of the floor of mouth such as true salivary duct cysts, dermoid cysts and cystic hygromas. The Latin word rana means \\"frog\\" (ranula = \\"little frog\\"). Treatment Treatment of ranulae usually involves removal of the sublingual gland. Surgery may not be required if the ranula is small and asymptomatic. Marsupialization may sometimes be used, where the intra-oral lesion is opened to the oral cavity with the aim of allowing the sublingual gland to re-establish connection with the oral cavity. Epidemiology The lesion is usually present in children. Ranulae are the most common pathologic lesion associated with the sublingual glands.

It is one of the largest street gangs in Canada. \\"Six inmates engineer mass breakout from Regina prison\\", Globe and Mail. August 26, 2008 Criminal Intelligence Service Canada (CISC) has designated the IP as being a member of Aboriginal Based Organized Crime (ABOC), along with Redd Alert and Alberta Warriors. CISC asserts that the Indian Posse, in addition to engaging in marijuana cultivation, auto theft, illegal firearms activities, gambling, and drug trafficking, also supports and facilitates criminal activities for the Hells Angels Outlaw motorcycle club and Asian-based networks. CISC 2004 Annual Report on Aborginal Based Organized Crime, retrieved 15 October, 2007 The Wolfe brothers The gang was founded in the summer of 1988 in Winnipeg as a street gang by the Wolfe brothers, Danny and Richard. Richard Daniel Wolfe was born in 1975 and Daniel Richard Wolfe was born in 1976. The Wolfe brothers were Cree, but spoke English as their first language through Danny Wolfe as an adult expressed the wish to learn Cree. The father of the Wolfe brothers, Richard Wolfe Sr, was an alcoholic while their mother, Susan Creely, was a drug addict and an alcoholic who by her own admission failed dismally at being a mother. As a father, Richard Wolfe Sr, was only irregularly involved in raising his sons, and was last seen by them in 1988. Creely's father was the chief of the Okanese First Nation reservation in Saskatchewan and he was a highly respected World War Two veteran. But his life fell apart due to his alcoholism, and he regularly beat his wife and children. Creely attended a residential school from the age of 6 onward and was raped by her teacher, causing her to engage in heavy drinking from the age of 12 onward. In an interview, Creely defined her mothering as: \\"I just went to the party and got drunk. I didn't give a shit. I did that because I didn't have any love in my heart and I didn't have parenting skills. I lost that in the residential schools\\". In sentencing Richard Wolfe in 2016, the judge stated: \\"He was raised in an environment where substance abuse and domestic violence was prevalent. Richard was repeatedly exposed to violence which occurred during his parents' house parties. He was sexually abused at the age of seven, once by a stranger and twice by a neighbour. The episodes of sexual abuse left Richard confused, ashamed and full of hate\\". Creely lived on welfare, but spent so much money on alcohol and drugs that her sons were usually hungry. To feed themselves, the Wolfe brothers started stealing, smashing the windows of cars to steal whatever money happened to be in the car in order to buy food, leading to frequent arrests. By the age of 10, Danny Wolfe was already an accomplished shop-lifter and stole his first automobile. The Wolfe brothers grew up in the \\"howling chaos of the North End\\" of Winnipeg where the people live in a Third World level of poverty and where arson, shootings, heavy drinking on the streets, prostitution and drug abuse were daily occurrences. The journalist Jon Friesen wrote about the Wolfe brothers: \\"By the time they were about ten or eleven years old, Danny and Richard were quite accustomed to raising themselves. They had no regard for conventional rules or morality. They saw themselves as survivors and were prepared to do whatever it took to make it\\". Creely who stopped her substance abuse and drinking in 2001 believes that if she had been a better mother, her sons might have chosen a different path, and now works as an youth counselor, trying to save troubled First Nations young people from the fate of her sons. The Wolfe brothers were greatly influenced by American gansta rap, which was their favorite genre of music, and much of the style of the gang owned considerably more to Afro-American gansta rappers than to First Nations culture. The word Indian was often used in a pejorative sense in Manitoba, and the Wolfe brothers picked the name Indian Posse as an attempt to cancel out the negative sense of the word Indian, just in the same way that some Afro-Americans call themselves niggers in an attempt to turn a derogatory word into an affirmative one. The symbol of the gang was and still is a red bandanna. The red bandanna is a symbol of the group's Red Power politics, symbolizes blood and passion, and because the gang believes that red is the color of power. The group was only open to indigenous people and was led by a \\"circle\\" (council) of ten. Officially, all decisions had to reached unanimously by the circle in a nod to the traditional collective leadership of the Cree whose ruling \\"circles\\" required unanimity, but in reality the Wolfe brothers dominated the circle. A sense of First Nations identity outweighed any of the traditional divisions and Cree, Ojibwa and Metis were all well represented in the Indian Posse. Within a year of its founding, the gang had hundreds of members and primarily engaged in theft. Initially the gang had both male and female members, but in 1990 the rules were changed to make the gang into an all-male group, ostensibly to protect the female members from violence . The cardinal rules of the Indian Posses are that its members were forbidden to take \\"hard drugs\\" such as cocaine and heroin; are never to speak to outsiders about the gang's activities: and that new members had to endure \\"minutes of pain\\" where they be beaten by other members for at least five minutes to test their toughness while those wishing to leave had also endure the \\"minutes of pain\\", but only for much longer. Richard Wolfe started carrying a handgun to school at the age of 13, and after his gun was discovered by a teacher, resulted in his first criminal conviction on 2 February 1989. By 1990, the Indian Posse moved into automobile theft and armed robbery. By 1991, the teenage Wolfe brothers had moved into drug dealing and prostitution and by 1992 had rented a house for $866 rent per month. In 1991, the Indian Posse had established an open air drug market outside of the Merchant's Hotel, known locally as \\"the Merch\\", on Selkirk Avenue in the North End of Winnipeg. The drug market outside of \\"the Merch\\" became one of the largest emporiums for buying drugs in Winnipeg. The Lord Selkirk Park Housing Development, whose inhabitants were almost entirely First Nations or Metis people had become the stronghold of the Indian Posse, whose members sold cocaine, LSD, heroin, and marijuana. The Third World poverty of the North End of Winnipeg made joining the gang attractive to many young people. Danny Wolfe was considered to be the \\"diplomat\\" who was calm and able to think in the long term while Richard Wolfe was the \\"warrior\\" who was a hot-head who thought only in the short term. On 1 June 1993, the Indian Posse was mentioned for the first time by the Winnipeg Free Press, who described the Indian Posse as the gang that caused much crime in the North End. Expansion On the night of 9 February 1994, a rival gang called the Overlords fired a shotgun at an Indian Posse house, leading to a drive-by shooting in retaliation a few hours later that left a woman wounded. As the first drive-by shooting in Winnipeg the incident attracted much media attention. Drive-by shootings are the favorite means of the Indian Posse to eliminate rivals, which in turn reflects the influence of black street gangs in Los Angeles, whom the Indian Posse model themselves after. The clothing style of the Indian Posse was a carbon-copy of Afro-American street gangs as the Indian Posse's preferred dress were and are baggy jeans, baseball hats, and track suits. The hand gestures which carry symbolic meanings used by the Indian Posse are copies of those used by black street gangs in Los Angeles. Danny Wolfe's favorite rapper was Tupac Shakur and the CDs of his music were one of his treasured possessions. Monster: The Autobiography of an L.A. Gang Member, the 1993 autobiography of Sanyika Shakur, a member of the Los Angeles gang, the Crips, has been described by the police as the \\"bible\\" of the Indian Posse, being virtually the only book that Indian Posse members all read, and which is constantly found whenever they raid the homes of Indian Posse members. In September 1994, the Winnipeg police announced that they were targeting the Indian Posse, whom they blamed for much of the crime in the North End. In response, Richard Wolfe gave an interview with the journalist Paul Wiecek of the Winnipeg Free Press which gave the gang a high profile in Winnipeg and beyond. Richard Wolfe claimed the Indian Posse was a Red Power group committed to defending First Nations people from a racist society. The Indian Posse uses slogans such as \\"Red Till Dead\\" and \\"Fuck Canada, this land is our people\\". In 1994, the Indian Posse had made contracts with criminal elements in reservations in North Dakota and South Dakota in an attempt to set up a cross-border smuggling network. The Wolfe brothers also frequently visited British Columbia to set up a drug-smuggling network with the Vancouver underworld. Despite their claim to be protecting First Nations people, the IP engaged in sexual slavery, forcing girls as young as 10 to work as prostitutes. By 1994, at the age of 19, Richard Wolfe was making between $15,000 to $30,000 a week, giving him an annual income of about $1 million Canadian dollars. However, the Wolfe brothers like other Indian Posse members were better at spending money than earning it. Sergeant Mike MacKinnon of Winnipeg police department stated: \\"There's no discipline to save cash and accrue assets. No education to rely on for cash management. You might pull them over and they'll have $10,000 or $15,000 on them, but at the end of the day that's money already spent...We haven't seen anyone moving up into buying large condos or anything like that. They still live in the neighborhoods they always lived in\\". Most of the Indian Posse members come from broken homes, which was a disadvantage as Richard Wolfe conceded in a 2011 interview: \\"The smart guy can be a tough guy when the time comes, but not vice versa. The smart guys usually stay out of gangs, though.\\" In a letter to his brother in 2000, Danny Wolfe put it more earthly that the Indian Posse's principle problem was \\"too many fucked-up people recruiting fucked-up people.\\" On 14 May 1995, Richard Wolfe shot a pizza delivery man, Maciej Slawik, and was convicted of attempted murder on 31 May 1996. The owner of the pizzeria Jumbo Pizza owed the Wolfe brothers $60, 000 in a drug debt and Richard Wolfe expected the money in cash in the pizza box when he ordered a pizza. To sent a message to the pizzeria's owner, he impulsively decided to kill the pizza delivery man, saying in 2011: \\"I lost my cool. There were lots of people mad at me for that\\". The fact that Slawik was a Polish immigrant who had nothing to do with crime was not relevant to Wolfe who blasted him with a shotgun. After Richard Wolfe was charged with attempted murder, Danny Wolfe threatened to kill two witnesses if they testified against his brother, leading for him to be convicted of obstructing justice and uttering death threats in September 1995. On 25 April 1996, a riot broke out at Headingley Correctional Institution between the imprisoned Indian Posse members vs the imprisoned members of the rival Manitoba Warriors, which brought the gang national attention for the first time. The riot, which put Headigley into a 18-hour lockdown, caused $8 million dollars in damage while leaving 8 guards seriously injured, four of whom had their fingers chopped off after taken prisoner. Much of the rivalry between the Indian Posse and the Manitoba Warriors concerns their attitude towards the Hells Angels. The Warriors have long purchased their drugs from the Hells Angels while the Indian Posse takes a more anti- Angel position. Richard Wolfe stated about his brother's attitude towards outlaw bikers: \\"Danny always hated bikers\\". By 1996, the Indian Posse had expanded into Saskatchewan, mostly because of the practice of the federal government of sending convicted Indian Posse members to prisons in Saskatchewan. In contrast to the Indian Posse, which began as a street gang, through it has been active in prisons since the 1990s, the Manitoba Warriors were founded as a prison gang in 1993, and which has since become active on the streets. The Manitoba Warriors and the spin-off group, the Alberta Warriors, reflecting their origins in the prisons tended to be more organized than the Indian Posse and to have stronger ties to other organized crime groups such as the Hell Angels. The rival Redd Alert gang were founded in Alberta's prisons by First Nations prisoners who did not want to be forced to join either the Indian Posse or the Warriors. As the feud between the Warriors and the Posse caused a spiraling murder rate among First Nations young men in western Canada, Phil Fontaine, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, attempted to mediate a truce in January 1997 between the two gangs. While serving a prison sentence in 2003-2004, Danny Wolfe befriended Gerry Matticks, the imprisoned boss of the Irish-Canadian West End Gang of Montreal. As Matticks is illiterate, Wolfe read and wrote letters for him. As the West End Gang control the port of Montreal, where most of the illegal drugs in Canada are imported, the alliance with the West End Gang became a profitable one for the Indian Posse. The Hells Angels approached Wolfe with an offer while he was in prison to become the exclusive wholesalers to the IP, selling them drugs while the IP would continue to serve as street dealers. Wolfe rejected the offer, saying the Indian Posse should be treated as equal to the Angels, not subordinates. In a phone call that was recorded by prison officials, Wolfe was heard to say: \\"We just told them [the Hells Angels], 'Hey man, we won't fucking stand in front, we won't stand behind you'. We're going to stand side by side if we do this...They wanted control. We just said 'No'. And ever since then, we had to back them off\\". The Indian Posse has since emerged as one of the Hells Angels' major rivals in western Canada. In September 2002, the Indian Posse tried to assassinate Maurice Boucher of the Hells Angels by firing a bazooka at his prison cell. In 2004, the Indian Posse were brought to further national attention by the documentary Stryker which chronicled a 13-year First Nations boy in Winnipeg working as an arsonist for the Indian Posse. In 2005, the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada reported that the Indian Posse had moved into Edmonton and Fort McMurray, where it was active selling drugs. The same report stated the Indian Posse was also active in the Grande Prairie and Peace River Country regions of Alberta. In May 2006, an Indian Posse leader, Sheldon McKay, was strangled to death in his prison cell at the Stony Mountain prison by four other members led by Danny Wolfe. Residents of the Samson Cree Nation reservation in Alberta blamed the Indian Posse for a drive-by shooting in April 2008 that left an innocent by-stander, the toddler Asia Saddleback, wounded when she was hit by a spray bullet. A gang member, Christopher Crane, shot up the Saddleback house because he believed it was the home of a rival gang member. In 2010, the RCMP reported that the Indian Posse had moved into northern Ontario, the rural areas in the interior of British Columbia and the Far North of Canada. In 2017, an IP member in Saskatoon, Kyle Landon Neapetung, was convicted of torturing with a blowtorch another man, Brenden Peters, for five days in March 2016. In 2018, an IP member, Elwood Terry Poorman, was charged with a murder in Port Coquitlam, suggesting that the Indian Posse had reached the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. Brad Peequaquat, a member of the Saskatchewan's Yellow Quill First Nation was recruited into an Indian Posse chapter with his brother Sherman, remembering: \\"They seemed to be young guys just like us. I just thought it'd be fun. We all joined....They promised us this fast, easy life, but it wasn't. They were living off of us, and we were getting sick of everything.\\" Sherman Peequaquat recalled that joining the IP: \\"The violence escalated, the stabbings and everything.\\" MacKinnon dismissed the claim that the Indian Posse is defending and protecting First Nations people, saying: \\"If you look at the victims of their homicides, the girls they force into prostitution and the people they sell drugs to, they're victimizing their own people. There is nothing cultural about the Indian Posse. The only cultural thing is a gang subculture.\\" The End of the Wolfe brothers On 20 September 2007, Danny Wolfe was involved in a verbal dispute in a bar in Fort Qu'Appelle with Bernard Percy Pascal, a member of the rival Native Syndicate. Later the same night, Wolfe broke into Pascal's house and started shooting everybody he saw. He killed Michael Itittakoose and Marvin Arnault while wounding Pascal, Jesse Obey and Cordell Keepness. Friesen describe Wolfe's shooting rampage as motivated by his ego as he could not stand any personal slights, real or imagined, and after Pascal insulted him in the bar felt that that only swift and blinding violence could avenge the blow to his ego. While in jail awaiting his trial, Wolfe broke out from the Regina Correctional Centre on 24 August 2008 and was arrested three weeks later in Winnipeg. The manhunt for Danny Wolfe across the Praries, who was described by the police as highly dangerous, attracted much media attention. During his three weeks of freedom, Wolfe returned to Winnipeg, where he engaged in much womanizing and substance abuse until to order to collect a reward an anonymous caller gave his location away to the police. In November 2009, Danny Wolfe was convicted of two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder, being sentenced to 25 years in imprisonment. Both the Wolfe brothers died in prison. While serving his life sentence in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary, Danny Wolfe was murdered by another prisoner on 4 January 2010. Richard Wolfe was convicted of attempting to murder a pizza delivery man in 1996, but was released on parole in 2010. Wolfe vowed to \\"go straight\\", but in 2013, he broke up with his girlfriend and started to abuse alcohol and drugs again. In November 2013, to prevent him from returning to prison, a couple gave him a home in their basement and attempted to help him turn his life around. On the night of 6 April 2014, Wolfe raped the woman and then attacked the man with a baseball bat after he heard his wife screaming. For this violation of his parole, Wolfe was sent back to prison where he died in 2016. In March 2015, he pleaded guilty to one count of rape and one count of assault with a deadly weapon. Owning to the dangers of attacks from rival gang members and for being a rapist, Wolfe was held in solitary confinement, causing him to suffer from severe depression, which contributed to his death from a heart-attack at the age of 40 on 27 May 2016.

Thus information is not adequately shared but rather remains sequestered within each system or subsystem, figuratively trapped within a container like grain is trapped within a silo: there may be much of it, and it may be stacked quite high and freely available within those limits, but it has no effect outside those limits. Such data silos are proving to be an obstacle for businesses wishing to use data mining to make productive use of their data. Typical information silos in a hierarchic structured organization. Information silos occur whenever a data system is incompatible or not integrated with other data systems. This incompatibility may occur in the technical architecture, in the application architecture, or in the data architecture of any data system. However, since it has been shown that established data modeling methods are the root cause of the data integration problem, most data systems are at least incompatible in the data architecture layer. Silo mentality In management, the term silo mentality often refers to information silos in organizations. Silo mentality is caused by divergent goals of different organizational units. It can also be described as a variant of the principal- agent problem. Silo mentality preferably occurs in larger organizations and can lead to a decreased performance and has a negative impact on the corporate culture. Silo mentality can be countered by the introduction of shared goals, the increase of internal networking activities and the flattening of hierarchies. Predictors for the occurrence of silos are * Number of employees * Number of organizational units within the whole organization * Degree of specialization * Number of different incentive mechanisms This should not be confused with a data silo in computing, like application virtualization, operating-system-level virtualization, or a separation kernel.  Etymology  The term functional silo syndrome was coined in 1988 by Phil S. Ensor (1931‚Äì2018) who worked in organizational development and employee relations for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Eaton Corporation, and as a consultant. \\"Silo\\" and \\"stovepipe\\" (as in \\"stovepipe organization\\" and \\"stovepipe system\\") are now used interchangeably and applied broadly. Phil Ensor's use of the term \\"silo\\" reflects his rural Illinois origins and the many grain silos he would pass on return visits as he contemplated the challenges of the modern organizations with which he worked.

It lies south of Newtownards. Both townland and civil parish are situated in the historic barony of Ards Lower. It is within the Ards and North Down Borough. It had a population of 939 people in the 2011 Census. Greyabbey is often associated with the antiques trade, there being several specialist antique shops in the village, as well as some interesting Georgian and Victorian buildings. Of particular note is Mount Stewart Estate (National Trust) as well as a traditional coaching inn.  History  The village (and townland) derives its name from Grey Abbey, a Cistercian abbey-monastery located on the north side of the village, dating from 1193. Historically it was also called Monesterlee or Monesterlea, which are anglicisations of its Irish name Mainistir Liath (\\"grey abbey/monastery\\").Placenames NI It was founded by Affreca, daughter of Godred Olafsson, King of the Isles, and wife of John de Courcy, Anglo-Norman conqueror of the province of Ulster. The site of the abbey was on the Ards Peninsula, from Newtownards, at the confluence of a small river and Strangford Lough. Architecturally it is important as the first fully gothic style building in Ulster; it is the first fully stone church in which every window arch and door was pointed rather than round headed. The abbey is located in the parkland of Rosemount House, home of the Montgomery family, to the east side of the village. Tradition says that Affreca founded the abbey in thanksgiving for a safe landing after a perilous journey at sea. The abbey was colonised with monks from Holmcultram in Cumberland, with which it maintained close ties in the early years. The construction of the stone church began almost immediately. In 1222 and again in 1237 abbots of Grey Abbey went on to become abbots of Holmcultram. The Latin name of the abbey is Iugum Dei, which means 'Yoke of God'. Little is known of the abbey's history, though it appears to have been almost completely destroyed during the invasion of Edward Bruce (1315‚Äì18). No reliable sources concerning the value of the abbey foundation survive, but it is not likely to have been prosperous. The abbey was dissolved in 1541. In the same year part of the monastic property was granted to Gerald, earl of Kildare. The monastery was physically destroyed during the military operations of the Elizabethan era. In 1572, Brian O'Neill burnt Grey Abbey in order to stop it being used as a refuge for English colonists trying to settle in the Ards Peninsula. In the seventeenth century the church nave was re- roofed and served as a parish church until 1778. In the late nineteenth century, repairs were executed by The Office of Public Works (The O.P.W.). Unfortunately, an excessive amount of concrete was used, the crudity of which is still obvious today. The remains of the abbey include the abbey church and some of the conventual buildings, dating from c. 1193 ‚Äì c. 1250. The original plan of the monastery can be followed with ease through foundations and earthworks. The abbot‚Äôs seat has been preserved. It is fitted inside a pointed arch and flanked by detached colonettes. Corbel tables are also a rarity in Ireland, but the Cistercians can boast two of them, one at Tintern and one at Grey. At Grey the corbels were inserted when the roof was raised, probably in the early fifteenth century. There are eight of them altogether, carved with oak leaves, human figures and animal heads. An outstanding effigy of a 'sword seizing' knight survives, thought to date from c. 1300 as well as an effigy of a woman carved in high relief and attired in thickly cut robes. Tradition relates that this is Affreca, who was buried in the abbey, but the style suggests that the effigy actually originated in the fourteenth century, a hundred years after her death. The ruins are now set in a private parkland, belonging to the eighteenth-century mansion, Rosemont House. The park is not accessible to the public. Irish Rebellion of 1798 ‚Äì On the morning of Pike Sunday, 10 June 1798 a force of United Irishmen, mainly from Bangor, Donaghadee, Greyabbey and Ballywalter attempted to occupy the town of Newtownards. They met with musket fire from the market house and were defeated. It is because of this association with the rebellion that the term \\"The Green Boys o' Greba\\" was given to the men of the village. GREBA is the name given to the village by the local residents, and also by those from the neighbouring areas. It is a localised \\"Ulster-Scots\\" terminology. The Rebellion of 1798 also affected the village in another form, with the death by hanging of the Rev. James Porter, Minister of Trinity Presbyterian Church, Greyabbey, which took place on 2 July 1798. The final resting place of Rev. Porter is in the Old Graveyard, Greyabbey, which itself lies adjacent to the ancient Abbey ruins. *On the Tullykevin Road in Greyabbey there is a brass plate on a field post in remembrance of a pilot who crashed and died there during the Second World War.  Churches  In the village are three places of worship, St. Saviours, Church of Ireland; Trinity Presbyterian Church; and First (Non-Subscribing) Presbyterian Church. Services in all three take place each Sunday, with various other associated meetings throughout the week. The local Roman Catholic place of worship is at St. Marys' Star of the Sea, Nunsquarter, Inishargy, with services each Saturday evening and Sunday morning, and also meetings throughout the week. St. Saviour's is noted for having a peal of change-ringing bells, which for over 15 years were the lightest ring of bells in Ireland, until the installation of bells at Dunmanway. They remain the second-lightest peal in Northern Ireland.  Loyal Orange Lodge  A Loyal Orange Lodge, working under the authority of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland sits in the Orange Hall, Main Street, Greyabbey. It takes the title of Greyabbey Loyal Orange Lodge, number 1592, and is itself part of the Upper Ards District LOL No 11, in the County Down Grand Orange Lodge. It was first formed in the village in 1863 and has had continued membership to the present day. A Junior Orange Lodge also meets in the village and takes the title of Greyabbey Junior Loyal Orange Lodge, number 253, and works under the authority of the Junior Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. The Junior Lodge was formed in 1977. Bands Greyabbey has had many musicians who have learned their skills through membership of the local bands. These bands, also known as 'marching bands' have ranged from Part-music Flute, Accordion, and the present-day First-Flute. They provide 'entertainment' for those who have membership of the band as well as those resident in the village as they take part in street parades, such as Remembrance Day, village Festivals, Somme Anniversary, and Orange Lodge Sunday Service parades and Boyne Anniversary parades. The village also has had the traditional Ulster Lambeg Drums as part of the music scene of the area. The history of these large percussion instruments goes back to the Williamite Wars in Ireland, circa 1690.  People  The nickname of the local residents of the village is the 'Greba Cras', deriving from the name of the village, 'Greyabbey', and from the abundance of 'Crows' who make their homes in the trees that grow on the outskirts of the village. A mythical story regarding this nickname tells the reader that in times gone by, when the Abbey was inhabited by the monks and they wanted to share the company of a female they would wrap their habit (cloak) around themselves, turn themselves into a crow, fly over the Abbey wall, lift an unsuspecting female, bring her back into the Abbey, and turning back into human form have some fun with her, before turning back into a crow and fly her back over the wall. A story, or yarn, to be surely taken with a large pinch of salt. * Actress Flora Montgomery, who featured in film and theatre, is the daughter of William Montgomery of Rosemount House and was born and raised in Greyabbey, their ancestral house * Botanist Rev.

Environment  There is a DRD Water Service wastewater treatment works at Greyabbey, which employs sophisticated membrane technology. This facility and a similar Works at Kircubbin, were completed under the same ¬£3.5 million contract. The original Greyabbey Wastewater Treatment Works was designed to treat wastewater for a population of 1,000. Since being upgraded, it is capable of treatment for a population of 2,500.

Invader Zim is an American animated television series created by Jhonen Vasquez. Twenty-one of the twenty-seven episodes originally aired on Nickelodeon from March 30, 2001 to December 10, 2002 while the remaining six were originally released on DVD on October 12, 2004. The recurring cast includes voice actors Richard Steven Horvitz, Rodger Bumpass, Kevin McDonald (The Kids in the Hall) and Wally Wingert. Vasquez voices parts in the show. The show was cancelled early in its run and some episodes were unfinished. The show ran for two seasons before its cancellation. Main characters =Zim= Zim (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz,Richard Steven Horvitz IMDB Billy West in the pilot and Melissa Fahn as a newborn in his flashback of \\"Parent-Teacher Night\\") is an incompetent Irken who is arrogant, foul- tempered, reckless, overzealous, uppity, impatient, impulsive, native, megalomaniacal and convinced of his own greatness. He dreams of regaining his leaders' trust by taking part in Operation Impending Doom II, so Zim is assigned as an ‚Äúinvader‚Äù to Earth, a planet which the Almighty Tallest believe has little to no chance of existing. However, against all odds, Zim makes it to Earth and establishes a base on a fake conquest mission. Zim disguises himself as a human child using a hairpiece to cover his antennae and contact lenses to make his eyes look normal. No one realizes that Zim is an alien, except Dib and Gaz. Zim has no friends, and often physically harms his classmates if they attempt to befriend him. However, despite this, they always naively defend him when Dib tries to warn them that Zim is a space alien. Zim is equipped with a PAK, a cybernetic backpack-like device with (among other gadgets) long, retractable robotic spider legs that enable him to move about quickly and climb almost any obstacle. Zim constantly schemes to enslave or destroy mankind, and despite his access to potent Irken technology, his plans are never successful. Zim also has a high opinion of himself, and will sometimes refer to himself in the third person. =GIR= GIR (voiced by Rosearik \\"Rikki\\" Simons) is a malfunctioning and dimwitted robot SIR (Standard-issue Information Retrieval) Unit who was assigned to Zim. He was built by the Almighty Tallest out of SIR unit remains from a trash can and rubbish they found in their pockets, and was subsequently passed off to Zim as a \\"top-secret\\" and \\"advanced model\\". He disguises himself in public by wearing a green dog suit, which fools most humans, despite looking and acting nothing like an ‚ÄúEarth dog‚Äù. Out of the pair, GIR has more interaction with Earth's social and cultural life-style. His personality is cheerful, friendly, and easy-going. GIR also has a love for Earth that his master does not share. Throughout the series, GIR has demonstrated talents such as cooking and dancing. GIR has no sense of who is a friend and who is an enemy. He also rarely understands the severity of the predicaments he finds himself in, unless it involves pain or very severe danger. However, he often understands it more than his master, and has on rare occasion predicted the correct outcome of a very dangerous situation. GIR's upbeat, clueless, thoughtful and friendly personality is a contrast to Zim's self-centered, imperious behavior. GIR enjoys taking part in Earth's culture, while Zim distances himself from it in order to complete his mission. Since GIR does not usually obey Zim, this often results in Zim growing furiously with GIR. However, GIR and Zim occasionally seem to care for one another. GIR is also non-binary and an icon. =Dib Membrane= Dib MembraneInvader Zim Issue #5 (voiced by Andy Berman)Andy Berman IMDB is a young eccentric paranormal investigator who spends his time studying the supernatural and paranormal, as well as thwarting Zim in his schemes to take over the world. Dib is generally mocked, bullied and hated by his classmates because they see him as annoying and crazy. Even though Dib‚Äôs classmates tend to bully him, he is reluctantly determined to defend and save them from Zim‚Äôs evil schemes anyway. Zim and Dib often fight and hate each other, as Dib, knowing Zim is an alien bent on destroying the Earth, is determined to protect planet Earth and humankind. While they are often portrayed as mortal enemies, Dib and Zim have at times been forced to work together as reluctant teammates. Despite their feud, an unfinished episode of the series titled \\"Mopiness of Doom\\" revealed that Dib lost interest in Zim and the paranormal while Zim gave up on destroying Earth and mankind, though he later came back when Dib changed his mind and decided to hunt Zim. Dib is self-conscious over the size of his head, and usually overreacts when people point out its largeness. It is revealed in some episodes that his head serves multiple purposes; in the episode \\"Halloween Spectacular of Spooky Doom\\", it served as a portal into other worlds. People such as the police, the F.B.I., NASA Place, and ‚ÄúThe Swollen Eyeballs‚Äù (a secret society which Dib is a member of, dedicated to discovering the paranormal and separating the fake superstitions from the real ones), tend to find Dib annoying. However, a few of these people realize just how sane Dib is and are kind enough to help him at times. Dib's secret codename as part of this group is ‚ÄúAgent Mothman‚Äù. Because he has cried wolf so many times, Dib finds it very hard for people to believe him, and is thrilled on the rare occasion when he finds someone who does. Nonetheless, he is willing and prepared to strongly defend the paranormal field of study whenever someone makes fun of it or claims it is not a real field of study. Before the comic book series was launched in July 2015, it was unknown what Dib and Gaz's surname was, if they had one at all. At the time of the television series, series creator Jhonen Vasquez claimed that their father Professor Membrane was actually using his first name in his title. However, the comic series has had Dib addressed as \\"Dib Membrane\\" multiple times, with the first being in a pre- Issue 0 and in an official Issue 5. =Gaz Membrane= GazleneNickelodeon Magazine 2007 Edition \\"Gaz\\" Membrane (voiced by Melissa Fahn)Melissa Fahn IMDB is Dib's younger sister who enjoys playing video games, drinking soda and eating pizza, particularly from her favorite restaurant Bloaty's Pizza Hog (a pastiche of ShowBiz Pizza Place and Chuck E. Cheese's). If and when someone or something stands in the way of her getting those things, she is extremely vengeful and quick to lose her temper. Like her brother, Gaz knows that Zim is an alien, but does not care because she believes he is incapable of conquering the Earth. Gaz very rarely displays happiness, and is usually humorless and ill-tempered. However, she is sometimes amused at Zim and Dib's misfortunes. She seems to be very underestimated, especially in the episode where she saves Dib‚Äôs life from Zim. Also, she was going to be Zim‚Äôs love interest. In the series, Gaz has either a lukewarm or a cold relationship with most of the other characters. She mostly dislikes her brother Dib, although she has been rarely shown to care about him. The only exception to all of the people she does not get along with might be her famous father, Professor Membrane. He seems to have a warm relationship with Gaz, even though it is not shown all that often. Gaz has a very vengeful and creepy way of stalking people who have significantly pestered, or upset her‚Äîlike Dib or the video game-crazed boy named Iggins. She has displayed amazing abilities in two episodes (\\"Battle Dib\\" and \\"Game Slave 2\\"). In the episode \\"Lice\\", it shown that Gaz can endure pain (in that case, the lice eating her scalp) and even calls the students who complain about the pain \\"whiners\\". Another example of Gaz's toughness is shown in \\"Dark Harvest\\" when Zim steals and replaces one of her organs with her Game Slave, but she continues to play her game, even though it is inside of her. Secondary characters * Almighty Tallest (Kevin McDonald as Purple; Wally Wingert as Red): Co-leaders of the Irken race. The Irken Empire has a hierarchal class structure wherein shorter individuals are both figuratively and literally looked down upon. The tallest Irken born in a specific generation takes command of the Empire as \\"The Almighty Tallest\\". Since Red and Purple, the two current Tallest, are exactly the same height (in addition to being identical in appearance aside from their eye colours), they share equal and high-supreme power. While the Tallest function mainly as figureheads, doing little to organize the society (preferring to lounge around, goof off with one another, and eat snacks), they do hold absolute power over the populace, just below the Irken Control Brains. They travel around the galaxies to observe and supervise Operation Impending Doom II in the Massive, the largest and most powerful starship in the Irken Armada. They appear to mostly use their unlimited powers of state to amuse themselves. They tend to be petty, and often bully and cause misery to their Irken subjects, having a childish outlook of their power. Red seems to have a slight focus on conquest, and is usually seen as being more intelligent than Purple, who commonly acts comically goofy. Red and Purple are always seen together and get along well, acting in a brotherly manner toward each other as they enjoy sharing in their power, despite their personalities contrasting. Along with their quirky obsessions with snack food and puppets, they also greatly enjoy poking fun at Zim. They both hate Zim due to his annoying, rebellious, sadistic, and destructive behavior (as does the rest of the Irken race). * Professor Membrane (Rodger Bumpass): A scientist who hosts the popular television show Probing the Membrane of Science and the father of Dib and Gaz. Membrane's scientific abilities are offset by incredibly poor parenting: his primary method of managing his children is by way of a floating digital projection screen-and his messages to them are often not only prerecorded, but woefully out of date. Professor Membrane is very rarely ever home due to the world always needing his help. However, he does make it a point to once a year have a family night with his kids and spends Christmas with them. He has sometimes urged Dib to give up on the paranormal and focus on \\"real science\\". His scientific achievements ranged from useful to bizarre, ranging from restoring power during a blackout to useful inventions like \\"SuperToast\\". Professor Membrane's first name is unknown. He has the ability to fire lasers out of his hands, which Enter the Florpus reveals to be because he replaced his arms with robotic prosthetic arms after his real arms were bitten off by sharks. * Ms. Bitters (voiced by Lucille Bliss and later Candi Milo in some video game adaptations): The teacher of Zim and Dib's class. She is a tall, slender, and elderly woman who is very grumpy, devoid of any compassionate emotion, and possesses a cynical dislike for life. She is often shown applying the school's unreasonable rules, or applying unreasonable punishments of her own invention for comedic purposes, often on Dib. She often slinks around to the sound of a cicada and is often shown literally emerging from people's shadows. Recurring characters * Tak (voiced by Olivia d'Abo): A female Irken who had an unfortunate encounter with Zim. The incident trapped her in a building on Devastis, the Irken military training planet, causing her to miss her chance to take the test to become one of the Irken Elite Soldiers (and an Invader). Instead, she was relegated by a Control Brain to janitor duty on Planet Dirt for 70 years, but she escaped to hunt down Zim. In \\"Tak: The Hideous New Girl\\", she comes to Earth, disguised as a human girl, and attempts to usurp Zim's mission and destroy Earth. She is thwarted by Zim, GIR, Dib and Gaz, who reluctantly work together to defeat her. * MiMi: Tak's SIR unit. Her disguise is also holographic, to be generated as a black cat. Like GIR, she is easily distinguishable from other SIR units, having a large robotic claw for an arm. She has no dialogue in the show. MiMi is taken over with GIR's personality and is dismembered by Tak in the process during the end of \\"Tak: The Hideous New Girl\\". * Piggy: A live pig that GIR has been seen having tea and watching movies with and seems to have a fascination with piggies, because he also has a large collection of rubber ones, which are thrown into a time machine by Zim to destroy Dib. * Computer (Jhonen Vasquez): Zim's computer is normally seen talking with Zim. He is scattered around the house and base so Zim can talk to him whenever he needs to. The computer also seems to display defects, similar to GIR, in both that he lacks information on Earth and will occasionally change his voice tone to a much harsher version at usually completely unnecessary times and situations. In the episode \\"Invasion of the Idiot Dog Brain\\" Computer's brain is replaced with GIR's. * Roboparents: Zim's helpers that guard his base and help make him seem more human. The Roboparents are poorly built and have an utter lack of normal parental behavior. The Roboparents frequently act inappropriately, or attack visitors to Zim's house, although in \\"Parent-Teacher Night\\" they actually reassured a parent about their son not making a soccer team, impressing even Zim. * Minimoose (Jhonen Vasquez): A floating purple moose-shaped creature with stubby legs and antlers, Minimoose is introduced as Zim's other sidekick. The series was cancelled before he could make his official debut in the unfinished episode \\"Nubs of Doom\\"; his only appearance was in the final episode, \\"The Most Horrible X-Mas Ever\\". * Invader Skoodge (Ted Raimi): An unlucky short and chubby Irken Invader who was assigned to planet Blorch, home of the slaughtering rat people, due to his shortness. He was the first Invader to successfully conquer a planet in Operation Impending Doom II, but is prejudiced against by the Almighty Tallest, who proceed to launch him into the planet as the first shot of the destruction. However, he survived this incident and returns in ‚ÄúHobo 13‚Äù. Skoodge is loyal to the Almighty Tallest, despite the fact that they judge and resent him due to his short stature. * Keef (Danny Cooksey): A clingy child that attends the Skool with Zim. He is seen to be overeager to have a friend in the second episode, \\"Bestest Friend\\", in which Zim befriends him to appear normal. In the episode, Zim grows tired of Keef's constant presence, and when Keef's \\"surprise party\\" for Zim jeopardizes base security, Zim tricks Keef into thinking a squirrel was him by replacing his eyes with robot eyes. He is seen in the background in numerous episodes, and has a few lines in \\"Lice\\". * The Swollen Eyeball Network (various): A group (including Dib, known within the group as \\"Agent Mothman\\") who are determined to prove the paranormal. Some Agents are Agent Mothman (Dib's alias), Agent Darkbooty (Revealed to be a NASA janitor), Agent Tunaghost, Agent Disembodied-Head, and Agent Nessie. Found in episodes \\"Battle of the Planets\\", \\"Battle Dib\\", \\"Zim Eats Waffles\\" and \\"Gaz, Taster of Pork\\" Minor characters * Lard Nar (voiced by Fred Tatasciore): The Vortian leader and captain of the Resisty, a group of ragtag aliens whose goal is to defy and ultimately bring down the Irken Empire due to having their planets conquered. Captain Lard Nar‚Äôs only appearance is in Backseat Drivers From Beyond The Stars. He is from the planet Vort, which has since been conquered by the Irken Empire. Lard Nar is a Vortian scientist who had contributed to building the Massive before the Irken Empire turned on Vort. Captain Lard Nar is very intelligent, but known to be nervous and make hasty decisions. Nonetheless, he cares about his Resisty crew, and was able to save them all from crashing into the Earth in Backseat Drivers From Beyond The Stars by evacuating them all from his starship. He also activated ‚ÄúShrinky Self- Destruct‚Äù on the Vort starship to protect its secret technology from being stolen by any alien thieves. * Bloaty (voiced by Rosearik Rikki Simmons): The owner and/or mascot of the Chuck E. Cheese's-like restaurant, Bloaty's Pizza Hog. He is mostly seen in commercials. He was only seen out of his pig costume once, in the episode \\"Bloaty's Pizza Hog,\\" and apparently has an eating disorder. He is an elderly, morbidly obese man, to the point of being fatter out of costume than in it. * President Man (voiced by Jeffrey Jones): The President of the United States who appears in the series, with his most significant role being in \\"The Girl Who Cried Gnome\\". He is essentially a figurehead, being the incompetent fool he is. The stupid things he has done include leaving the coat hanger in his suit, giving up his power to \\"Santa\\" (who was really Zim in disguise), and trading the fate of a \\"crisis\\" for Ninja Star cookies, which he is exceedingly fond of. * Nick (Jhonen Vasquez): Excessively happy human held captive by Zim for experimentation. His most notable feature is the enormous drill-like \\"happiness probe\\" in his head. He appears in \\"Zim Eats Waffles\\", \\"GIR Goes Crazy And Stuff\\" and \\"The Girl Who Cried Gnome\\". * Sizz-Lorr (Jim Wise): Zim's chef boss, a tall, powerful, and very heavyset Irken Frylord who appears in one episode, \\"The Frycook What Came from All That Space\\". He kidnaps and takes Zim back to his true place of exile, ‚ÄúShloogorgh's Flavor Monster‚Äù on the planet Foodcourtia as retribution for Zim abandoning his true assignment as a Food Service Drone before the first episode. Zim just barely escapes Sizz-Lorr while fleeing his capture on Foodcourtia, but only due to the gravity increasing from a massive amount of snacking, which prevents anyone from leaving the planet for 20 years. * Bill (Adam Paul): Moronic paranormal investigator who believes that ghosts, the Loch Ness Monster, and Bigfoot are fake, while cereal box characters such as Count Chocofang and Frankenchokey are real. Seen in \\"Career Day\\" and \\"The Sad, Sad Tale Of Chickenfoot\\". * Mr. Elliot (Simon Scott Bullock): Gaz's teacher. Appears to have a positive outlook but is not revealed to have very much intelligence. Seen in \\"Gir Goes Crazy And Stuff\\", \\"Gaz, Taster of Pork\\", \\"Parent-Teacher Night\\", and was going to appear in the unfinished episode \\"Simon sez Doom\\". * Iggins (Paul Greenberg): Gaz's enemy and gaming rival. An obsessed video game nerd who was prominently featured in the episode \\"Game Slave 2.\\" Iggins takes the last Game Slave 2 console, (and the American version of Vampire Piggy Hunter), thus incurring the wrath of Gaz, and he goes crashing down to earth in an elevator after giving her the Game Slave 2. Although at first it appears he had perished from the crash, Iggins exuberantly bursts forth from the wreckage, completely unharmed, while dramatically yelling his name at the very end of the episode. He appears again in ‚ÄúWalk For Your Lives‚Äù, but has a non-speaking role, seen getting arrested by a cop for just doing nothing. * Peepi: The class hamster who was turned into a giant monster by Zim in \\"Hamstergeddon\\". *Gnomes: Robotic gnomes protect the exterior of Zim's house when people are in the yard, with the ability to shoot lasers from their eyes.

It was established on May 14, 1769, by Gaspar de Portol√°, leader of the first European land exploration of Alta California - at that time an unexplored northwestern frontier area of New Spain. The presidio was the first permanent European settlement on the Pacific Coast of the present-day United States. As the first of the presidios and Spanish missions in California, it was the base of operations for the Spanish colonization of California. The associated Mission San Diego de Alcal√° later moved a few miles away. Essentially abandoned by 1835, the site of the original Presidio lies on a hill within present-day Presidio Park, although no historic structures remain above ground. The San Diego Presidio was registered as a California Historical Landmark in 1932, then declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. History Prior to occupation by the Spanish, the site of the Presidio was home to the Kumeyaay people (called the Diegue√±os by the Spaniards). The first Europeans to explore San Diego Bay and its environs were members of the maritime expedition led by Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo in 1542. Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no visited again in 1602, but no settlement was made until the fort was begun in May 1769. On July 16, 1769, Mission San Diego de Alcal√° was established by Jun√≠pero Serra on Presidio Hill. The presidio had a commanding view of San Diego Bay and the Pacific Ocean, allowing the Spanish to see potential intruders. Less than a month after the mission was established, an uprising of Indians occurred; four Spaniards were wounded and a boy was killed. After the attack, the Spaniards built a stockade which was finished in March 1770. It included two bronze cannons: one pointed to the bay, the other to the nearby Indian village. One of the cannons, El Jupiter, is now in the Serra Museum. In 1773 and 1774, adobe structures were built to replace the temporary wood and brush huts. Later in 1774, the mission was moved a few miles up Mission Valley to separate the Indians from the influence of the presidial garrison. By 1783, there were 54 troops stationed at the presidio.For the Revillagigedo Census of 1790, see The Census of 1790, California, California Spanish Genealogy. Retrieved on 2008-08-04.

Ruins of the San Diego Presidio (National Historic Landmarks collection). With Mexican independence in 1821, the presidio came under Mexican control, and was officially relinquished by the Spanish on April 20, 1822. From 1825-1829, it served as the Mexican governor's residence. The presidio was abandoned by 1835 and fell to ruins, because settlers preferred to live in the more accessible town - present-day Old Town San Diego State Historic Park - which developed at the foot of Presidio Hill. Preservation The Serra Museum in Presidio Park marks the original site of the Presidio and Mission In 1907 George Marston, a wealthy department store owner, bought Presidio Hill with an interest to preserve the site. Unable to attract public funding, Marston built a private park in 1925 with the help of architect John Nolen. He also funded Jun√≠pero Serra Museum, designed by William Templeton Johnson and built in 1928-29 in Spanish Revival style architecture, to house and showcase the collection of the San Diego Historical Society (now the San Diego History Center). Serra Museum is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Presidio, but in fact nothing remains of the original Presidio. Marston donated the park and museum to the city in 1929. Presidio Park is still owned by the city of San Diego; Serra Museum is managed by the San Diego History Center. No historical structures remain in Presidio Park today. The Presidio site is occasionally used for archaeological excavations. There are additional photographs available.

In addition to regular screenings and artists, it is home to many events associated with the annual Santa Barbara International Film Festival.  History  Located at 1317 State Street, the Arlington was built in 1931 on the former site of the Arlington Hotel, which was destroyed following the 1925 earthquake. The current structure was erected in 1930 as a showcase movie house for Fox West Coast Theaters. It was restored and expanded in the mid-1970s by Metropolitan Theaters Corporation. It opened in its current incarnation in 1976.  Architecture  Looking toward the entry, just past the ticket booth. Fountain in the center of the hallway. Doors into the theater. The Arlington was designed in the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival styles in a period when Santa Barbara was being rebuilt in that style following a powerful earthquake in 1925. The exterior has a Mission Revival steeple that ends in an art deco finial. The red tiled building features a covered courtyard with fountain and a free-standing ticket booth. The interior is elaborately decorated. The ceilings of the lobbies are heavily beamed and painted. The auditorium itself seats 2,018 on the main floor and balcony. It is built to give theatergoers the impression that they are sitting outside in the plaza of a colonial Spanish town, each wall features houses, staircases, and balconies, not painted on but built out from the walls. The proscenium, in the original theater, was formed by what appeared to be a large stone arc, through which could be seen a river and hills (these were painted on the curtain.) Today, this effect is gone, and the proscenium is topped by the equipment necessary for lighting stage shows. The original ceiling remains to give patrons the impression that they are sitting outdoors under the stars. One of the Arlington's signature features is a Robert Morton pipe organ from the Loew's Jersey Theatre that was installed in 1949. Hidden below the orchestra floor, the organ's console rises on a platform into view when played at a performance. The Arlington Theatre was designed by the Santa Barbara architectural firm of Edwards and Plunkett.

The battle ended in the rout of the Desmond (or Geraldine) forces. It was one of the last private battles fought in Britain or Ireland. Causes ‚Äì a private war Munster had been dominated by the Old English Fitzgeralds of Desmond and Butlers of Ormonde since the 13th century. The vast Fitzgerald lands spanned the south and south-west of Ireland, across the modern counties ‚Äì Cork, Kerry, and Tipperary. Ormonde territory centred on the city of Kilkenny and concentrated in counties Kilkenny, Waterford, and Tipperary. The rival dynasties were locked in a cycle of raids as each side sought to consolidate and expand its territory at the expense of the other. In the 1560s, this exploded into war. In the preceding years the widowed Countess of Ormonde, mother of Sir Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde, had married Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, with a view to reconciliation between the two houses. In 1560 her intervention secured a peaceful outcome to a stand-off at Bohermore (known as, the battle that never was). Her death in 1564 ended the truce, and raiding was resumed on both sides. Gerald FitzJames FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, claimed jurisdiction over \\"The D√©ise\\", (pronounced \\"day-sha\\") in County Waterford, and in January 1565, crossed the Blackwater with his army, to levy tribute in the old form of \\"coign and livery\\". Sir Maurice Fitzgerald, 1st Viscount Decies, chief of the district and a Desmond dependant, resident in the borderland between the territories, called on his first cousin, Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond for help.Joyce, P.W., A Concise History of Ireland, Dublin, 1909, ¬ß382 Ormonde mobilised his men to intercept the Geraldines at Affane, a ford over the Finisk, a tributary of the Blackwater River, in the foothills of the Knockmealdown Mountains near Lismore. The battle Desmond's forces comprised his Fitzgerald kinsmen, allied Gaelic clans such as the O'Connors and O'Briens, and a disaffected dependant of Ormonde's, Sir Piers Butler of Cahir. Ormonde's troops were provided by the Butler lords with Gaelic and Old English levies. Desmond left Lismore at first light with 80‚Äì100 horse, 300‚Äì400 foot, and hundreds of followers. In the company of the MacCarthys, O'Sullivans, MacSheehys, and O'Connors, he marched to Bewley at the tidal high point of the Finisk, where he demanded service of Maurice Fitzgerald in the formal way, according to the customary military exactions of coyne and livery. Fitzgerald offered to go to arbitration, but Desmond insisted on the sole decision of his brehon; they could not agree. Desmond pitched camp, ordered the slaughter of 60 cattle, sent some horseboys out to fire a few houses and sent others to Dungarvan for wine. Three houses were set on fire, and Ormonde came down the mountain with the O'Kennedys, Gillapatricks, and Burkes. A local man advised Desmond to attack immediately, lying to him that Ormonde himself was absent. Lord Power, however, urged him to retreat to his house at Curraghmore and consider his position. Desmond's assessment was that the opposing forces were weak and could be taken with ease, and so he chose to attack. The Geraldines set off for Dromana in the parish of Affane, the chief seat of the Fitzgeralds of the Decies, taking up reinforcements at Lismore on the way. At this point Ormonde had progressed to the ford of Affane, a short distance below Lismore Castle, where his forces, bearing a red flag, were passed by Desmond's foot soldiers at the crossroads. Desmond's men hoisted their banner, and matters came to a head. Desmond spotted Ormonde and spurred his horse onward, causing a desultory exchange of gunfire. Ormonde fell into defensive formation. Ormonde's brother, Sir Edmund Butler of Cloughgrenan, hit Desmond in the right hip with a pistol-shot, cracking his thigh-bone and throwing him from his horse. With their leader fallen, the Geraldine troops were routed and the Butlers pursued them to the riverbank. About 300 Geraldines were killed, with many drowning as they were intercepted by armed boats in crossing the river. As the badly wounded captive Desmond was being carried shoulder-high from the field, an Ormonde commander rode up and jubilantly inquired, \\"Where is now the great Lord Desmond?\\" Whereupon Desmond is said to have retorted, \\"Where but in his proper place, on the necks of the Butlers?\\" Ormonde took the wounded Desmond in captivity to Clonmel and then to Waterford city, where Lord Deputy of Ireland Nicholas Arnold took custody of him after a legal wrangle with Ormonde. Sir Henry Sidney replaced Arnold, but his attention was initially occupied in dealing with the depredations of Shane O'Neill in Ulster. In 1567, Sidney headed south and attempted to broker peace between Desmond and Ormand. He brought Desmond a prisoner to Dublin, leaving Desmond's brother, John FitzJames FitzGerald, to govern Munster in the Earl's absence. Consequences Elizabeth I of England was furious that two noble houses had fought a private battle, defying the authority she claimed over the Kingdom of Ireland. The fact that both sides had displayed their banners in the battle was a particular affront to her ‚Äì it was a symbolic rejection of the monopoly of the crown on making war. (In the same year the Battle of Glentaisie was fought in Ulster, also a private battle.) Both earls were summoned to London to explain their actions. However, the treatment of the dynasties was not even-handed: the Earl of Ormonde, a cousin of the Queen's and a court favourite, convinced Elizabeth that it was Desmond who was at fault. As a result, both Desmond (who had been brought before the privy council on a litter) and his brothers, Se√°n and James, were arrested and detained in the Tower of London; it was seven years before the earl returned to Munster with his wife, Eleanor. This action contributed significantly to unrest in the province of Munster and ultimately led to the first of the Desmond Rebellions in 1569. References Sources *Lennon, Colm.

She was a member of Liverpool County Borough Council from 1930 to 1961. Although she never held office in government, she won a national reputation for her forthright campaigns in connection with housing, public health and other social issues. Braddock inherited much of her campaigning spirit from her mother, Mary Bamber, an early socialist and trade union activist. After some years in the Independent Labour Party (ILP), Braddock joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) on its foundation in 1920, but quickly became disillusioned with the party's dictatorial tendencies. She left the CPGB in 1924 and later joined the Labour Party. Before the Second World War, alongside her husband Jack Braddock she established a reputation as a crusading left-wing councillor, frequently at odds with her party while pursuing an agenda of social reform. During the war she worked in Liverpool's ambulance service, before winning the Exchange division for Labour in the 1945 general election. With her formidable physique and outspoken manner, Braddock was a pugnacious presence in parliament, and a keen supporter of the 1945‚Äì51 Attlee ministry's reform agenda, particularly the establishment of the National Health Service in 1948. She served on Labour's National Executive Committee between 1947 and 1969. Her combative style led to a brief suspension from parliament in 1952. For most of her parliamentary career she remained a member of Liverpool's council, and was a central figure in the controversy that arose in the 1950s over the city's decision to acquire and flood the Tryweryn Valley in Wales for the construction of a reservoir. Between 1953 and 1957 Braddock served on the Royal Commission for Mental Health which led to the Mental Health Act 1959. From the early 1950s she moved steadily to the right wing of her party, and was increasingly acerbic in her judgements of her former colleagues on the left. When Labour won the 1964 general election she refused office on the grounds of age and health; thereafter her parliamentary contributions dwindled as her health worsened. Towards the end of her life she became Liverpool's first woman freeman. After her death in 1970 her Guardian obituarist hailed her as \\"one of the most distinctive political personalities of the century\\". Life =Early years= Childhood Elizabeth Bamber was born on 24 September 1899 at 23 Zante Street, in the Everton area of Liverpool, the eldest daughter of Hugh Bamber, a bookbinder, and his wife Mary, n√©e Little. Mary had come to Liverpool as a child when her father, a well-to-do Edinburgh lawyer, abandoned his family after his descent into alcoholism and poverty. Liverpool in the late 19th century suffered extremes of deprivation, and had the highest infant mortality rate in the country. Mary became a trade union organiser and campaigner against deplorable social conditions, and established a reputation as an outstanding platform speaker. She was the dominant early influence on her daughter Elizabeth, who formed a lifelong determination to represent and fight for the disadvantaged. St George's Hall and Plateau, Liverpool, the site of early 20th century soup kitchens and a 1911 riot In 1902 the Bamber family relocated to Smollett Street in nearby Bootle, one of several moves that caused Elizabeth's formal education to be divided among different schools. Alongside her normal schooling, her political education began at the Marmaduke Street Socialist Sunday School, and through the medium of her mother's campaigning activities. One of Elizabeth's early memories was of the soup kitchen for the destitute which Mary helped to run on St George's Plateau: \\"I remember the faces of the unemployed when the soup ran out ... I remember blank, hopeless stares, day after day, week after week, all through the hard winter of 1906‚Äì07\\". At the age of eleven Elizabeth left the Sunday School and joined the youth section of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), where she studied socialism alongside a busy programme of social activities. She later described herself at this time as \\"strong, agile, fond of walking and eating\\". By this time Mary Bamber was working as an organiser for the Warehouse Workers' Union; Elizabeth assisted her mother, sometimes acting as a steward at meetings. Mother and daughter were both present at St George's Plateau on 13 August 1911, when a baton charge by police and troops broke up a rally in support of Liverpool's striking transport workers. Hundreds were injured, and in the disturbances that followed, two demonstrators were shot dead. The day became enshrined in Liverpool's working-class history as \\"Bloody Sunday\\". ILP years Elizabeth left school in 1913, and began work filling seed packets for five shillings a week. The job was too monotonous to engage her for long, and after a few months she found a post in the drapery department of the Walton Road Co-operative store. At her mother's insistence she became a member of the Shopworkers' Union. Meanwhile, she attended classes run by the Workers' Educational Association and the Plebs' League: \\"They told me how the capitalists controlled money, business and the land, and ... hung on to them\\". Within the group of young socialists who gathered regularly at the ILP's local headquarters, there were three Elizabeths. To avoid confusion, lots were drawn to decide who should be known respectively as Elizabeth, Betty, or Bessie. By this means Elizabeth Bamber took the name Bessie, which she retained for the rest of her life. Among the other ILP activists at Kensington was Sydney Silverman, four years older than Bessie, the son of a poor draper. Silverman was a considerable influence on the youthful Bessie; he would be her future colleague, both in the Liverpool council chamber and the House of Commons. When the First World War began in August 1914, the ILP opposed it as \\"an appalling crime upon the nations\\" who had been \\"stampeded by fear and panic\\". On the introduction of conscription in 1916, Silverman and others adopted positions of uncompromising pacifism, and were imprisoned. The ILP welcomed news of the Russian Revolution of 1917, and vigorously opposed allied intervention in the civil war that followed it. Bessie played a leading role in a TUC \\"Hands Off Russia\\" rally in Liverpool's Sheil Park, where she and others resisted the efforts of the British Empire Union to capture the ILP's red flag. At the end of the war in 1918, Bessie left the Co-op and took a clerical post with the Warehouse Workers' Union. In the course of her ILP activities she had met and befriended John \\"Jack\\" Braddock, a wagon builder and union activist with a reputation as a firebrand. He had arrived in Liverpool from Dewsbury in 1915, hoping to emigrate to Canada, but had stayed in the port and immersed himself in left-wing politics and the fight to improve working conditions. He and Bessie became very close; in 1919 they helped Mary Bamber to fight for a Liverpool council seat, as the ILP's candidate in the Everton district. The election campaign was bitter and at times violent, but resulted in Bamber's victory by the slim margin of 13 votes. =Communist activist= By 1920 Mary Bamber, Bessie and Jack Braddock had become disillusioned with the ILP, which seemed to them to lack the necessary radicalism to march with the times. At the time, Sylvia Pankhurst's Workers' Socialist Federation, the British Socialist Party and other socialist organisations were increasingly coordinating their activities, and in 1920 merged to form the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Under Mary Bamber's influence, both Bessie and Jack Braddock left the ILP to become members of the new party. Within the CPGB the young couple became acquainted with Wal Hannington, leader of the National Unemployed Workers Committee Movement. They joined his \\"work or maintenance\\" campaign which aimed to raise the levels of Poor Law relief to what they considered a proper subsistence level. The couple did not endear themselves to the CPGB hierarchy when, on egalitarian grounds, they opposed the levels of salary which the party wanted to pay to its full-time officials. In the joint autobiography written with Jack, The Braddocks (1963), Bessie cites the formative experience of police violence on \\"Bloody Sunday\\" in 1911 as a motivating factor for her CPGB activities. On 12 September 1921, again at St George's Plateau, she attended a rally for the city's jobless, organised by the Liverpool Unemployed Workers' Committee. Again there was police intervention; Jack and Mary Bamber were charged with unlawful assembly and received a token one day's imprisonment. In 1922 Bessie and other party members provided comfort and shelter to Hannington's hunger marchers, as the columns of unemployed passed through Lancashire on their way to London. Bessie combined her party roles‚Äîshe was treasurer of the Liverpool branch‚Äîwith her full-time union post; Jack, meanwhile, was only intermittently in work, as his incendiary reputation meant that employers were reluctant to give him a job. He had been living for some time at the Bambers' home when, in February 1922, the couple were married at Brougham Terrace registry office, during the course of a working day. After a brief reception they returned to their respective duties‚ÄîBessie to her union job and Jack to his volunteer work for the CPGB. The Braddocks were not comfortable as CPGB members. They objected to the lack of autonomy afforded to local branches by the party's central \\"Political Bureau\\", and to what they perceived as the leadership's unquestioning subservience to the Soviet Union. Mary Bamber, after a visit to Russia, opined that there were as many true communists in Liverpool as in Moscow. In 1924, increasingly convinced that communist rule would lead to the enslavement rather than the liberation of workers, the entire leadership of the Liverpool CPGB branch, including both Braddocks, resigned from the party. =Liverpool council= After leaving the CPGB, the Braddocks continued their socialist activism in Liverpool. Jack's role in the Merseyside Council of Action (an impromptu militant action group) during the 1926 General Strike made employers even less willing to engage him. He was rescued by the action of Sir Benjamin Johnson, a liberal-minded industrialist, who lent him the money to purchase a Co-operative Insurance Society agency. Jack and Bessie were now determined to pursue their political aims by democratic methods, and in 1926 they joined the Fairfield ward of the Liverpool Labour Party. In the 1929 Liverpool council elections, Jack was returned unopposed as the Labour councillor for the Fairfield ward. A year later Bessie joined him, elected in the St Anne's ward. St Anne's, one of the most deprived areas of the city, contained a closed workhouse at Brownlow Hill, which the Conservative-controlled council had decided to sell to the Roman Catholic Church as the potential site for a cathedral. The Labour group's official policy was to delay the sale for several years, so that the empty workhouse buildings could be used as temporary housing during slum clearance and rebuilding. The issue split Labour on religious lines; nearly all the Catholic members of the Labour group defied party policy and voted for an immediate sale. Among the rebels was the sitting St Anne's councillor, Olive Hughes. She was thereupon deselected by the St Anne's ward, which chose Bessie as their candidate for the 1930 election. Bessie faced a difficult task, since Hughes chose to stand against her as an Independent Socialist, with the support of leading local Catholics in a ward where the electorate was 85 per cent Catholic. An intense campaign, during which Bessie claimed to have visited every street in the ward, brought her success. Liverpool Town Hall This victory did not delay the workhouse's fate; the site was duly sold to the Catholic Church for ¬£110,000, and demolition began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As a member of the council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues. The Labour group on the council remained divided. The group's leader was Luke Hogan (1885‚Äì1954), of Irish stock and closely identified with the Catholic caucus. He enjoyed the strong support of around two-thirds of the Labour councillors; the Braddocks, and from 1932 Sydney Silverman, were part of the smaller leftist wing of the group. Clashes between the two sides were frequent, the main contention being the supposed attempts by Hogan and his followers to \\"catholicise\\" the local party. When in 1936 Hogan tried to block the renewal of a grant to a local birth control clinic, Bessie led a cross- party rebellion of councillors which ensured that the grant was maintained. She argued that most of the 87 women who had died in childbirth the previous year might have survived with access to contraception. Mostly, Bessie was uncompromising in her attitude towards the council's ruling Conservatives; on one occasion she was ejected from the council chamber by the police, after she had called the Housing Committee chairman a liar and refused the mayor's order to withdraw the remark. She justified this behaviour on the grounds that \\"if you didn't do something outrageous, nobody would take any notice of you\\". She had earlier resorted to using a two-foot megaphone in a council meeting, to demand action over housing conditions and slums. Inspired by her colleague Silverman, who in the 1935 general election became MP for Nelson and Colne, Bessie determined to seek a parliamentary career of her own. This ambition contrasted with that of Jack, who turned down the chance to be Labour's candidate in the Everton constituency to concentrate on his local government role. In 1936 Bessie was selected as Labour candidate for Liverpool Exchange. This inner-city division had long been held by the Conservatives, mainly because of a substantial \\"business vote\\" which, before the abolition of plural voting in 1948, gave owners of businesses an extra vote in the constituency where their business operated. In the recent election the seat had been held by the Conservative, Sir John Shute, with a majority of 4,412. Bessie was then 36 years old; she would have to wait for nearly 10 years before she could fight her seat, as the general election that would normally have been held in 1939 or 1940 was postponed by the Second World War. In the years immediately before the war Bessie was concerned at the extent of recruitment in the city by the British Union of Fascists. She was outspoken in her attacks on fascist groups, and in her defence of those who attacked their parades. The death of her mother Mary Bamber in June 1938, at the age of 63, was a considerable personal blow to Bessie, and was widely mourned within Liverpool's socialist community. =Second World War= On the outbreak of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3 May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost until the end of the war in 1945. In 1942 Bessie and Jack moved to what would be their home for the remainder of their lives, a suburban semi-detached house in ZigZag Road, in Liverpool's West Derby district. They remained active members of Liverpool council, and in 1943 Jack became deputy leader of the Labour group. Two years later the Braddocks healed the rift with Hogan by proposing and seconding his appointment as the city's Lord Mayor for the year 1945‚Äì46; Jack succeeded him as leader of the Labour group on the council, a post he held until his death in 1963. Bessie became honorary president of the Liverpool Trades Council and Labour Party (LTCLP), the body that had been formed in 1921 when the Liverpool Trades Council merged with the newly formed local Labour Party to form a united labour front. =Labour MP= Labour government 1945‚Äì51 King George VI in 1945 Despite some opinion polls indicating a Labour lead, most commentators expected that Winston Churchill's prestige would ensure a comfortable Conservative victory in the July 1945 general election. Before polling day, The Manchester Guardian surmised that \\"the chances of Labour sweeping the country and obtaining a clear majority ... are pretty remote\\". The News of the World predicted a working Conservative majority, while in Glasgow a pundit forecast the result as Conservatives 360, Labour 220, Others 60. The expectations of a Labour victory in Liverpool Exchange were not high, but Bessie's chances were boosted by the poor local record of the sitting member, Colonel Shute, and she herself was confident. Defying most forecasts, across the country Labour won 393 seats, and with an overall majority of 146, Clement Attlee formed the first majority Labour government. Bessie won Liverpool Exchange with a majority of 665 from 16,000 votes cast. In an assessment of the new MPs, the Daily Express described Bessie as \\"a character among the Labour women. Very forthright in her speech, strong in her Labour faith ... never hesitates to call a spade a spade\\". Physically imposing‚Äîshe admitted to weighing 15 stone (210 pounds, 95 kg)‚Äîshe made an impact with her maiden speech on 17 October 1945, during a debate on the national housing shortage. After taunting the Conservative opposition by claiming to have \\"filched\\" the Exchange seat‚Äî\\"the prize Division of the [Liverpool] Tory Party\\"‚Äîshe made an impassioned plea to the new Minister of Health, Aneurin Bevan, for immediate measures to improve the slum housing conditions in Liverpool, and throughout the country: \\"Particularly in industrial areas, people are living in flea- ridden, bug-ridden, rat-ridden, lousy hell-holes\\". She ended her speech with a promise that she and other Labour back-benchers would continue to agitate until the conditions in which many were forced to live, \\"as a result of having been represented for so long by the Conservative Party\\", were removed. Bessie's aggressive anti-Toryism was frequently in evidence during her first years in parliament, especially when she could attribute to them the economic miseries of her Liverpool constituents. In a Commons debate on 28 March 1946 she welcomed the government's decision to close the Liverpool Cotton Association, which she denounced as \\"the bulwark of the Tory administration in Liverpool\\", nothing more than a group of financiers who gambled with the industry in order to make profits for themselves. On 1 May 1947 The Manchester Guardian, reporting the chaotic Commons scenes during the divisions following a debate on the nationalisation of the railways, recorded that \\"Mrs E.M. Braddock ... danced a jig as she moved over to the Opposition benches where she occupied the seat usually used by Mr Churchill.\\" When the Bolton Evening News called her performance \\"nauseating, a sorry degradation of democratic discussion\\" she sued the newspaper for defamation. She lost the case, and a subsequent appeal was unsuccessful. In 1947 Bessie was elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee (NEC). At the time she was generally identified with the left wing of the party, and was associated with a grouping known as the \\"Socialist Fellowship\\", which espoused a programme of colonial freedom, workers' control and reduced arms expenditure. She resigned from the Fellowship in 1950, along with fellow-MPs Fenner Brockway and Ellis Smith, when it condemned the United Nations intervention in the Korean War. She continued her wholehearted campaigning on behalf of the poorest in the country, pleading with parliament to \\"remember the queues outside the Poor Relief offices\\", and castigating the \\"New Look\\" fashion of 1948 as wasteful, \\"the ridiculous whim of idle people\\". Bessie's fiery reputation did not harm her electorally; in the February 1950 general election, with the Exchange constituency greatly increased by boundary changes, her majority rose to 5,344. Nationally, Labour lost 76 seats, and its parliamentary majority was reduced to five. Attlee's second government was short-lived; in the October 1951 general election Bessie increased her personal majority again, to 6,834, but nationally Labour was defeated by the Conservatives and went into opposition. Outside her political duties Bessie, a keen fan of boxing, accepted the honorary presidency of the Professional Boxers' Association, and was a passionate defender of the sport. Her enthusiasm arose in part from her experiences as a juvenile court magistrate; she believed that the sport fostered character and mutual respect. She was frequently at odds with her parliamentary colleague Edith Summerskill, a physician who wrote the anti- boxing tract The Ignoble Art, and campaigned for the sport's abolition. 1950s: Rightward shift After leaving Socialist Fellowship, Bessie moved steadily towards the centre and right of her party, distancing herself from colleagues with whom she had earlier found common cause. She did not support Aneurin Bevan when he resigned from the government in April 1951 over the introduction of National Health Service charges, and later asserted that, by making dissidence fashionable, Bevan had \\"weakened the [Labour] National Executive to the point where it could no longer deal effectively with infiltrating Trotskyists and Communists\\". In 1955 her opposition to the Bevanite faction was such that she supported efforts by Hugh Gaitskell and Herbert Morrison to have Bevan expelled from the party. She regularly attacked the Labour left at party conferences, and in 1952 was involved in scuffles with other delegates after the unexpected success of Bevanite candidates in the NEC elections. Also in 1952, Bessie's volatile temperament caused her to become the first woman member to be suspended from the House of Commons, after she repeatedly protested to the Deputy Speaker for failing to call her during a debate on the textile industry, a matter of great concern to her constituents. In general, however, her forthright attitude won her cross-party respect, and in 1953 she was appointed by Churchill (who had returned as prime minister in 1951) to the Royal Commission on Mental Health, otherwise known as the Percy Commission, whose work led to the Mental Health Act 1959. Bessie's increasingly centrist stance troubled party members in Liverpool Exchange, where the Bevanite faction was generally popular. In 1954 the local party passed a motion requesting that she step down before the next general election. This was rejected by the NEC, who believed that Bessie was a national electoral asset. Shortly before the May 1955 general election the Exchange party tried again, and voted by 40 to 39 to deselect her. Bessie, convinced that this vote had been rigged, appealed to the NEC, who set the decision aside and imposed her on the constituency. These party machinations had no effect on Bessie's popularity with the voters; in the election on 26 May, despite the intervention of a left-wing Independent Socialist candidate, she increased her majority to 7,186. Nevertheless, nationally the Conservatives retained power with an increased parliamentary majority. In the municipal elections held that same month, Labour won control of Liverpool's council for the first time; Jack Braddock became council leader. Bessie gave up her St Anne's ward seat, after 25 years, but remained on the council as a co-opted alderman. Campaigns and controversies, 1956‚Äì59 In May 1956 Bessie's concerns about the treatment of prisoners in Walton Prison led to an investigation by Sir Godfrey Russell Vick, which revealed numerous instances of violence by members of the prison staff, and brought about reforms. In July that year, during a home affairs debate, Bessie demanded tougher regulations on the supply and licensing of air pistols, which under the existing law were readily available to juveniles. She alarmed the house by brandishing two such pistols which, she explained, she had confiscated in the course of her duties as a juvenile court magistrate. When rebuked by the Deputy Speaker, she replied that she had deliberately used shock tactics, reprising her earlier council chamber argument that \\"no one takes any notice unless someone does something which is out of order, or is unusual\\". She also campaigned for the rights of larger women to obtain fashionable clothes; using her substantial 50\\" ‚Äì 40\\" ‚Äì 50\\" measurements to advantage, she took part in a fashion show aimed at the larger-than-average woman. In 1956, as part of a Liverpool council delegation, the Braddocks visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the mayor of Odessa, a city with which Liverpool had informal fraternal links. Her overall impression of the country was of drabness and oppression, with welfare provision generally well below British levels, although she conceded that medical facilities were excellent. Before returning home she informed the mayor of Odessa that \\"after forty years of socialism ... you haven't achieved half of what we have in Britain\\". The Tryweryn reservoir, controversially built between 1957 and 1965 In the later 1950s an issue arose which tarnished the reputations of both Braddocks in the eyes of much of Liverpool's Welsh community and the people of Wales. In 1955 Liverpool council applied for the compulsory purchase of land in the Tryweryn Valley, Merionethshire, North Wales, for the construction of a reservoir to serve Liverpool's increasing needs for water‚Äîsome 65 million gallons a day. The proposal would mean the flooding of the small village of Capel Celyn, and several farms. On 7 November a deputation led by the Plaid Cymru president Gwynfor Evans sought to address the council in a plea for a change in policy. According to Bessie's biographer Ben Rees, while Evans was speaking, Bessie banged on the table and joined other councillors in insulting Evans and demanding that he \\"go back to Wales\\". In July 1957, when the enabling legislation reached its second House of Commons reading, Bessie described the scheme as regional rather than local, and claimed that some parts of Wales would benefit from it. The land to be flooded in the Tryweryn Valley was not, she said, of high agricultural value, and \\"nothing was done that was not agreed to by the tenants in the area\\". The bill became law, and construction began in 1959, but protests and demonstrations continued until the reservoir's opening in 1965. The slogan Cofiwch Dryweryn (\\"Remember Tryweryn\\") was coined by nationalists, says Rees, as \\"a reminder of Liverpool's greed and lack of sensitivity\\". In October 2015, on the 50th anniversary of the reservoir's completion, protestors demonstrated around the statue of Bessie at Liverpool Lime Street station. In the October 1959 general election the Conservatives, now led by Harold Macmillan, increased their majority in parliament to 100 seats. In Liverpool Exchange Bessie defied the national swing, and increased her proportion of the vote. On a reduced turnout her personal majority fell slightly, to 6,971. Later career, 1960‚Äì68 In 1961 Bessie's aldermanic term on Liverpool's council expired. That year, the Conservatives briefly took control of the council, and used their majority to block her reappointment. This ended 31 years' service on the council. In 1963, when Labour regained control, she did not seek re-instatement. The year 1963 saw the publication of The Braddocks, in which Bessie made a sustained attack on communism and Trotskyism: \\"The purpose of this book is to bring home to the rank and file how wide that influence is ... unless positive steps are taken by the workers themselves ... democracy will be dead\\". Reviewing the book for the Socialist Standard, Lawrence Weidberg thought it gave a useful picture of early 20th century working-class life in Liverpool, but concluded that \\"from the evidence of this book the Braddocks qualified fully for the role of blind leaders of the blind\\". On 12 November 1963 Jack Braddock died of a heart attack at the age of 71, while attending an official function in Liverpool. The October 1964 general election brought Labour a narrow victory under Harold Wilson, while in Liverpool Exchange, Bessie achieved her best personal majority to date, 9,746. She did not take a post in the new government; according to The Guardian she was offered a job, but declined on the grounds of health and age. Although she fought the next election, in March 1966, and held Liverpool Exchange easily, for the final six years of her parliamentary life she was relatively inactive and often absent through illness. Her last contribution in the House was on 27 January 1969, a question regarding facilities for disabled drivers. =Final years and death= In 1968 Bessie became vice chairman (and therefore chairman-elect) of the Labour Party. However, in February 1969 she collapsed with exhaustion and was hospitalised. In August she resigned from the NEC on health grounds, thus forgoing her succession to the party chairmanship. In September she announced that she did not intend to contest the next general election, and would retire from politics, a decision which shocked and disappointed her constituents. In April 1970 she was awarded the freedom of the City of Liverpool, the first woman thus honoured. Bessie formally left parliament at the dissolution before the June 1970 general election; on 13 November 1970 she died in Liverpool's Rathbone Hospital, at the age of 71. At her funeral service held a few days later at Anfield Crematorium, in the course of his tribute, Harold Wilson summed her up thus: \\"She was born to fight for the people of the docks, of the slums, of the factories and in every part of the city where people needed help\\". The service was non-sectarian in accordance with her atheism.Christopher Warman (14 November 1970). \\"'Merseyside legend' Mrs Braddock dies at 71\\". The Times (58023). col G, p. 1. \\"Mrs. Braddock, whose husband died in 1963, was an atheist, and her funeral service, next Tuesday at Liverpool crematorium, will be non-sectarian.\\" Appraisal Statue of Bessie Braddock at Lime Street Station At the time of her death, commentators described Bessie as one of the most notable political personalities of her time, and perhaps the best-known woman in Britain after Queen Elizabeth II. She was especially appreciated in Liverpool, where much of her campaigning zeal for better housing and healthcare was concentrated. Widely known and remembered as \\"Battling Bessie\\", thirty years after her death she was placed eighth in a BBC poll of \\"great Merseysiders\\". Bessie was renowned for the sharpness of her tongue, either in pursuit of her campaigns or in denouncing her enemies. She frequently used inflammatory, colourful language, once describing an opposing councillor as a \\"blasted rat\\", and another time telling the Tory majority that she was willing \\"to take a machine gun to the lot of you\\". In contrast to this aggressive public, Bessie's private life was unostentatious. She did not smoke or drink, dressed conventionally and holidayed modestly in Scarborough. Nevertheless, she enjoyed the company of many glamorous friends from the worlds of show business and boxing. Towards perceived adversaries, Bessie showed neither patience nor respect, especially those with whom she had once shared common ground on the far left. Apart from her attacks on Bevan, she displayed particular scorn for the future Labour Party leader Michael Foot, whose practice in the 1950s of writing articles attacking the Labour leadership for right-wing newspapers was, she thought, disloyal. A much reported exchange between her and Churchill has her accusing him of being drunk, and him concurring but adding: \\"My dear you are ugly, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly\\"‚Äîor similar words. There is no reliable evidence that any such exchange took place; despite its popularity, commentators are generally sceptical. In 1984, Radio City, an independent Liverpool radio station, broadcast a 4-part dramatisation of Jack and Bessie Braddock's lives. Bessie Braddock is commemorated in Liverpool by the statue in Lime Street Station, and by a blue plaque erected at her modest home in ZigZag Road. In a 2014 Fabian Society essay the Labour MP Lisa Nandy wrote that Bessie \\"brought her experiences of life in the slums of Liverpool right into the heart of Westminster. Now, more than ever, we need the voices of working women to be heard in parliament\\".

The series revolves around an extraterrestrial named Zim (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz) from the planet Irk and his ongoing mission to conquer or destroy a dark and satirical version of the Earth. His various attempts to subjugate and destroy the human race are invariably undermined by some combination of his own ineptitude, his malfunctioning robot servant GIR (Rosearik Rikki Simons) and his nemesis Dib (Andy Berman), one of very few humans not oblivious enough to be unaware of Zim's identity. Invader Zim premiered on March 30, 2001. The series was targeted at tweens and teens and met with critical acclaim. As the series went on, ratings declined and budgetary issues became more frequent. Before the second season was completed, Nickelodeon canceled the series, leaving several episodes unfinished. The show originally ran on Nickelodeon from 2001 to 2002, with six of the completed second-season episodes initially going unreleased. These episodes were first made available on DVD in 2004 and later made their television debut on the Nicktoons Network in 2006. Despite its early cancellation, due to increasing popularity and above-average merchandise sales, it has been widely regarded as a cult classic. The series consists of a pilot episode, twenty-seven episodes split into forty-six episode segments, and at least seventeen unfinished episode segments that were in production at the time of the series' cancellation. On December 24, 2011, the pilot episode aired on television for the first time. Thirty-eight episode segments were originally broadcast in pairs, each 12-minute episode segment debuting in the same half-hour. There are eight double-length episodes which run for 24-minutes each. This list is ordered by the episode order in the DVD releases, with broadcast dates noted. Almost every episode was directed by Steve Ressel; the only exception is the pilot, which was directed by Jordan Reichek. A television film based on the series, entitled Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus, premiered August 16, 2019 on Netflix.  Series overview  Episodes =Pilot= A pilot for Invader Zim was produced for Nickelodeon in 1999, featuring Billy West as the voice of Zim. It was first released publicly as a special feature on the Invader Zim Vol. 1: Doom Doom Doom DVD set on May 11, 2004. The pilot made its television debut on Nicktoons on December 24, 2011, as part of their \\"Nicktoon's Winter Funderland\\" block. =Season 1 (2001‚Äì02)= The first season of Invader Zim consists of twenty episodes, which are ordered below by production number and not their original broadcast order. =Season 2 (2002; 2006)= In August 2001, Nickelodeon officially renewed Invader Zim for a second season which was originally planned to consist of twenty episodes. In January 2002, Nickelodeon announced that they had plans to cancel the series. The series finished with a total of twenty-seven out of its initially contracted forty episodes, leaving several episodes unfinished. The seventh episode of season two aired on Nickelodeon on December 10, 2002. The remaining six completed second season episodes were initially unreleased. These episodes would first be made available on DVD in 2004 and later made their television debut on the Nicktoons Network in 2006. =Netflix film (2019)= In April 2017, Nickelodeon announced that there would be a television film based on the series. On June 26, 2018, it was announced that the film was titled Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus. The film released digitally on Netflix on August 16, 2019.

By contrast, mood incongruence occurs when the individual's reactions or emotional state appear to be in conflict with the situation. In the context of psychosis, hallucinations and delusions may be considered mood congruent (such as feelings of personal inadequacy, guilt, or worthlessness during a bipolar disorder depressive episode) or incongruent.  Background and theorists  An important consideration to the difference between mood congruence and mood dependent (or state-dependent) memory is the determination that one cannot make accurate assumptions about the emotional state of a memory during the encoding process. Therefore, the memory that is recalled is not dependent on the affective state during encoding. Another important difference is that there are multiple memories that can be recalled while in particular mood states that go across contexts and cues that may or may not recall only one specific memory. = Gordon Bower = An example of this is demonstrated through a theory proposed by Gordon Bower called the associative network theory of feeling effects. Bower's theory explains the multiple associations of memory congruence within the paradigm of the nodes of the semantic memory network. The associative network theory of feeling effects explains how emotions are connected to many different words that represent the given emotion and represent different meanings for different individuals. Like with semantic memory networks, the nodes that represent particular emotions are triggered by the words that invoke that emotion. For instance, the word 'dog' can trigger different emotional nodes that represent different word strings and meaningful associations based on different and individual experiences. For a person who has only had positive interactions with the word 'dog', the person would subsequently connect to the emotional nodes that represented positive meanings such as dog = pet = happiness in childhood. Therefore, Bower's theory determined that not only are particular words linked to other words or phrases that represented similar affects, but that emotions in themselves had their own representative nodes distinct to their affective nature within the semantic memory network. The existence of distinct affective nodes thus explains how multiple positive or negative connotations can be conjured from memory when stimuli is presented that is of negative or positive valance. The significance of how positive or negative associations and their represented meanings in the semantic memory networks of individuals who experience the effects of memory congruence has been demonstrated in various word association studies in which the common methodology is to take samples of individuals that represent both positive, negative and neutral affective states and determine which words they recall most when presented with words representing both positive and negative connotations. In these studies the results more often than not represented the findings that the sample of participants representing positive mood states recalled more positively connoted words, and those who represented the negatively affected group recalled more negatively connoted words. However, an interesting portion of the studies were the groups that represented the neutral group that neither had feelings of negativity or positivity. These groups recalled more positive words than negative words. Another aspect of Bower's theory in mood-congruence in memory is that the rate of occurrence of particular emotionally represented nodes may become implicitly primed. Even if an individual is not paying full attention to the event in which the affective priming had occurred. Affective memory nodes are then able to connect to a further multitude of inferred or generalized meaning where the congruent recall may not be of a specific autobiographical event. The recall may instead form a generalized representation or prime the associations of future episodes or learning to be particularly positively or negatively biased. The priming explanation also gives relevance to the idea that those who are depressed recall more negatively congruent memories than those who are not depressed. The semantic memory paradigm also adds representational meaning to the theories of eye- witness testimony and false memories. In memory congruence of current emotional states to memory, one may not remember details of situation due to a high level of emotional arousal. This is where the generalization of previously primed connections 'fill in the gaps' of these details to form misrepresented or false memories. = Theory of emotional valence = Conversely, there are theories of mood-congruency in memory recall that explain the instances and studies that represent incongruences. One such theory is the circumflex model assumption, or the theory of emotional valence. The theory of valence in regards to mood-congruency and memory recall is that the nature (positive or negative) of the emotion at encoding is congruent with the nature of the emotion in which the memory is to be recalled. The theory of valence has had both significant and contradictory findings. The significant findings are similar to those that are represented in the studies mentioned previously within the paradigm of semantic memory. The contradiction of the valence theory is in studies where the moods of the participants were found to represent mood-incongruence. The incongruence is especially particular in findings of valence asymmetry, in which those who were in a current negative mood recalled more positively associated words or memories. A proposed reason for this occurrence is that the individuals who are recalling positive memories while in negatively affective states are confounded by their personal attitudes, levels of self-esteem and their world views. Therefore, it has been found that samples of individuals who have higher levels of self-esteem or more positively world views tend to remember more positive events even when in a negatively affective state. These people are able to thus control their own retrieval processes than individuals who have lower self-esteem or negative world views. = Theory of categorical conception = In opposition to the conundrum of the valence theories of mood-congruence, proponents such as Paula Niedenthal propose a theory of categorical conception. The theory of categorical conception argues that mood-congruence of current affective states and memory recall are subject to attentional strengths and deficits in category matching. Instead of all emotions being either negative or positive, as represented in the theory of valence, emotions are seen as distinct categories. The theory of categorical conception assumes that an individual's current affective state determines what they pay attention to. The attention can be implicitly or explicitly encoded. For instance, if an individual is sad, they will pay more attention to the aspects of their environment that are congruent with sadness such as melancholy or dreary weather. Therefore, if someone is frequently depressed, they are more likely to pay attention to representations of their depression and create a larger memory repertoire of depressed memories than happy memories. Being that the person has a higher number of encoded memories that have negative or sad connotations, they are then more likely to experience a higher level of mood congruent memories than more happy memories. = Social psychology connection = Moreover, in social psychology, \\"mood congruency\\" refers to a cognitive mechanism that explains a wide variety of mood effects in which there is a match in affective valence between people's mood and their responses (Mayer et al., 1992). Cognitive therapy pays special attention to mood congruence due to the use of mood repair strategies, which are meant to shift an individual from a negative mood to a positive one. Examples: * Congruent mood‚Äîsmiling while feeling happy. * Non-congruent mood‚Äîsmiling while feeling anxious. * Inappropriate affect‚Äîlaughing while describing a loved one's funeral, for instance. Mood Congruency is strongest when people try to recall personally meaningful episodes, because such events were most likely to be colored by their moods.

The museum features a restored lobby shell from the defunct La Concha Motel as its visitor center, which officially opened on October 27, 2012. For many years, the Young Electric Sign Company (YESCO) stored many of these old signs in their \\"boneyard.\\" The signs were slowly being destroyed by exposure to the elements. The signs are considered by Las Vegas locals, business owners and government organizations to be not only artistically, but also historically, significant to the culture of the city. Each of the restored signs in the collection holds a story about who created it and why it is important.http://www.neonmuseum.org/about History The Neon Museum was founded in 1996 as a partnership between the Allied Arts Council of Southern Nevada and the City of Las Vegas. Today, it is an independent non-profit. Located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza, the Neon Museum includes the new Neon Boneyard Park, which is adjacent to the former YESCO Boneyard. The impetus behind the museum was the loss of the iconic sign from The Sands; after it closed in 1995, there was no place to store the massive sign, and it was scrapped. To mark its official opening in November 1996, the Neon Museum restored and installed the Hacienda Horse & Rider sign at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont Street. However, access to the collection was provided by appointment only. Annual attendance was approximately 12‚Äì20,000 during this time. In 2005, the historic La Concha lobby was donated to the museum, which moved and reassembled the building north along Las Vegas Boulevard after cutting it into eight pieces. It now serves as the museum's visitors' center and headquarters. Although it cost nearly $3 million to move and restore the La Concha, the plans to open a museum became concrete after the donation of the building, drawing a number of public and private grants and donations. In total, approximately $6.5 million was raised for the visitors' center, headquarters, a new park, and restoration of 15 major signs. In November 2009, the Neon Museum restored and installed the famous Silver Slipper sign across from its welcome center, and two more restored vintage signs were installed near the northern end of Las Vegas Boulevard to mark its designation as a National Scenic Byway. Paid public admission commenced on October 27, 2012, replacing the prior appointment-only basis. Attendance during the first year was 60,461, exceeding the early estimate of 45‚Äì50,000 visitors. After outgrowing its space in the former La Concha lobby shell, the museum moved its headquarters to old City Hall in 2016 and converted the offices into a museum store. In 2017, the museum purchased land for its first expansion since opening to the public in 2012. For its fifth anniversary, the Neon Museum offered free admission on October 28, 2017. In 2018, the Neon Museum administrative staff moved again to a space on the campus of the Las Vegas-Review Journal and opened a programming space there called Ne10 Studio. Exhibits The Neon Museum is located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza Road, South of Cashman Center and along the Las Vegas downtown museum corridor. The museum has exhibits in three main areas: restored and installed neon signs in both the Fremont Street area and along the Las Vegas Strip; and in the Neon Boneyard. =Restored signs= The Neon Museum maintains several restored signs throughout Downtown Las Vegas and along the Las Vegas Strip. The cost of restoring signs is estimated to range from $10,000 for small pieces to $100,000 for the largest signs. =Boneyard= The Neon Boneyard Park was installed in 2012, with \\"NEON\\" spelled out using letters shaped like those on signs for the Golden Nugget (\\"N\\"), Caesars Palace (\\"E\\"), Binion's Horseshoe (\\"O\\"), and Desert Inn (\\"N\\"). The letters are set on a grid inspired by the sign for The Sands, and the sign is decorated with stars like those from the Stardust and a starburst like the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign designed by Betty Willis. Pieces in the boneyard include signage from the Stardust, Riviera, Desert Inn and Caesars Palace as well as many others. The Neon Museum also houses fiberglass sculptures including a giant skull from the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino among others. In 2018, the Neon Museum began Brilliant!, a 30-minute night show designed by Craig Winslow which uses multiple projectors to reanimate defunct signs, set to vintage and contemporary music.

His colleagues in this project were Tribonian and Theophilus; and their work was accomplished in 533 and they were all granted with the highest title quaestor sacri palatii illustris. Except for the first code of 7 April 529, Dorotheus participated in the compiling of all Justinian's codes (Institutes, Digest and Codex repetitae praelectionis), including the second edition of the Codex Constitutionum (promulgated in 534).Brandsma, Frits: Dorotheus and his Digest translation, p. 5, Groningen 1996, As a method of teaching, the ancient law professors (so-called antecessores) used to write commentaries (sometimes mere translations) on all parts of Justinian's law. While Justinian's law was promulgated in Latin, these commentaries were written in Greek, because lawyers (students and practitioners) were hardly able to read Latin anymore.N. van der Wal: Tweetaligheid en recht in het Romeinse keizerrijk, Groningen 1976 Fragments of this commentary, which was in the Greek language, have been preserved in the Scholia appended to the body of law compiled by order of the emperor Basilius the Macedonian and his son Leo the Wise, in the 9th century, known as the Basilica.Among many others e.g.: BS (Basilica Scholia) 1932-20; 2127-29; 2666-14; 2805-26 From this, it seems probable that the commentary of Dorotheus contained the substance of a course of lectures on the Digest delivered by him in the law school of Berytus. This course of lectures followed a strict order, which was prescribed by Justinian in his constitutio Omnem. According to this schedule the Institutes, a part of the Digest (Books 1 - 22) and all of the code were taught successively and most of the lecture would consist of dictation. In this dictation pattern comes firstly the Index of the statute at stake, secondly the original text in Latin and thirdly the veritable lecture on conceptual, literal and substantial problems of the respective provision.Simon, Dieter: Aus dem Kodexunterricht des Thaleleios, Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung f√ºr Rechtsgeschichte (ZSSt) / Romanistische Abteilung / Band 86, 1969, p. 334 References * Category:Byzantine jurists Category:Greek lawyers Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Justinian I Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:6th-century Latin writers Category:6th-century Byzantine writers Category:6th-century jurists ","title":"Dorotheus (jurist)"},{"id":"3620911","text":"Retsina, a Greek white wine Greece produces many food products.

The arrest took place in the parking lot of The Habana Inn.http://www.atmgallery.com/artwork/press/miller.html Reportedly, Latham followed a plainclothes police officer's car for several blocks, ultimately pulling up beside it. Latham told the officer that he enjoyed \\"a particular lewd act\\" and then solicited the police officer to perform the act at a room Latham said he had booked at the nearby Holiday Inn Express. Latham did not offer money in exchange, so he was not charged with soliciting prostitution. Upon posting bail, Latham contested the charge to local television reporters, saying \\"I was set up. I was in the area pastoring to police.\\" \\"I was involved in a prayer ministry in that area, and I had a dialogue with police,\\" he said, according to the website of the Daily Oklahoman newspaper. \\"The officer made many suggestions.\\" According to police officials, Latham made no mention of prayer, told the officer his name was \\"Luke,\\" and said he was from Dallas and worked frequently in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. This was not Latham's first visit to the area. Public records show that on December 2, 1998, at about 11:30 p.m., Latham was issued a traffic ticket for \\"failure to stop for a stop sign\\" at NW 39th and Frankford. This intersection is only blocks from where Latham was arrested and serves as rear access to the Habanna Inn.\\"http://www.johntv.com/images/tickets/12-02-98-Latham_ticket.pdf PDF Document =Reaction within the Southern Baptist Convention= South Tulsa Baptist Church issued the following statement: \\"We are deeply grieved to hear the news about our pastor, Lonnie Latham. Our first concerns are with Lonnie, his family, and our church family. We will be focused on doing what we can to minister to everyone in this difficult time. Our church has a great history and a great future of ministry in this community. We would appreciate your prayers.\\" On January 8, 2006 Rev. Lonnie Latham notified The Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma that he was resigning from the BGCO Board of Directors effective immediately. ‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened by the recent events regarding Lonnie. We continue to be concerned for South Tulsa Baptist Church and the Latham family. We pray Lonnie will find healing and restoration as he seeks help for the issues he faces,‚Äù said Heidi B. Wilburn, spokeswoman for the BGCO. \\"Lonnie‚Äôs resignation has been accepted without the BGCO Board of Directors having to take initiative regarding the matter. Lonnie also indicated he has resigned from the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention.\\" Pastor Accused Of Lewdness Resigns From Convention Anthony Jordan, BGCO executive director-treasurer, spoke with Baptist Press after having talked with Latham. \\"We have a dual responsibility,\\" Jordan said. \\"From the standpoint of the church and, certainly, as brothers in Christ, we are to hold Lonnie to the biblical standard of morality and to hold him accountable for his actions.\\" He added, \\"Lonnie has responded to that admonition by resigning from his church, asking their forgiveness and stepping aside to seek healing. \\"At the same time, in the midst of failure, the church is to be a place of restoration,\\" he said. \\"That is the biblical admonition.\\" On January 9, 2006 a letter from Latham to his congregation was released. Morris Chapman, CEO of the Southern Baptist Convention, says of Latham - \\"In spite of his denials soon after his arrest, he now acknowledges the incident did happen and that he needs help.\\" Dr. Charles A. Cruce, Director of Missions for The Tulsa Metro Association of Baptist Churches posted the following message: :\\"Our association of churches is saddened by the recent news concerning our former Executive Director, Dr. Lonnie Latham, now pastor of our own South Tulsa Baptist Church. We hurt deeply for Lonnie, for his loved ones, and for the wonderful church that he pastors. While we certainly do not condone this type of behavior, it is so important for us to remember that Lonnie is one of our own and our actions toward him as a fellow member of God‚Äôs Family should be responses of grace, mercy, and forgiveness. What has happened in this situation only demonstrates that we are all human, that we all make mistakes and that we all fail. That is why we need a Savior who heals, who forgives, and who restores ... that‚Äôs why we need Jesus.\\" =Reaction from within the GLBT community= Jamie McDaniel, a spokesperson for Soulforce who works to change the antigay policies of the SBC, said: \\"It‚Äôs tragic that so many, like Rev. Latham, have never been told the truth that they can live with dignity and express their God-given sexuality in ways that are open, honest, loving and life-affirming. Trapped by Southern Baptist misinformation, many people of faith think their only option is to live a dark and secretive double-life. The SBC needs to be held accountable for causing this kind of needless suffering.\\" Writes Leslie Robinson of the gay newspaper, The Dallas Voice, \\"Whew, good thing I‚Äôm not required to take such a high-minded approach. I appreciate that Latham has likely been suffering a long time, and that his family is in pain. But the man has been a colonel in the campaign against us, so I prefer to point, yell 'Hypocrite!' and resign myself to the fact that I won‚Äôt be on Soulforce‚Äôs Christmas-card list.\\" In a January 6 press release, The National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce commented: \\"This isn't the first time he's been in the area, having received a traffic violation there a few years back. \\"Rev. Latham has been an outspoken opponent of...rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. And, of course, in recent years the Southern Baptist Convention - the nation's largest Protestant denomination - has become increasingly homophobic and aligned itself with the worst elements of the far right in working to stop Marriage Equality for gay people... \\"These kinds of situations involving anti-gay political and religious leaders being caught, literally, with their pants down are hardly uncommon. My instinctual reaction has always been one of smug satisfaction - \\"serves the damn hypocrite right.\\" \\"...I only feel sadness for Rev. Latham and his family.\\" Rev. Dr. Mel White, founder of Soulforce, an organization which works on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people to oppose religious and political oppression, commented about Rev. Latham's arrest: \\"No one should have to come out via an undercover sting operation. That is its own evil. Until the Southern Baptist Convention ends their spiritual violence against gay and lesbian people, tragedies like this will continue.\\" Results of criminal trial On February 2, 2006, Latham pleaded not guilty to the lewdness charge.http://www.kotv.com/main/home/stories.asp?whichpage=1&id;=96889 The case was then heard in a non-jury trial.http://www.oscn.net/applications/ocisweb/GetCaseInformation.asp?submitted=true&viewtype;=caseGeneral&casemasterID;=1996992&db;=Oklahoma On March 7, 2007, Latham was found to be not guilty by Special Judge Roma McElwee, who said her ruling was based on the evidence and not on the issue of the constitutionality of the law in question.http://www.acluok.org/LegislatureCourts/BaptistMinister'sCaseContinues.htm Latham's attorney, Mack Martin, has told reporters that what his client did was Constitutionally protected and shouldn't be a crime. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like saying you‚Äôre arrested for crossing the street ‚Äî so what?‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúThis is a major First Amendment issue.‚Äù Mack says he feels the only reason that the court is pursuing charges is because of pressure from the media attention. But Oklahoma City District Attorney Wes Lane says, ‚ÄúThe law in Oklahoma prohibits an individual from soliciting another to engage in what is considered a lewd act regardless of whether money is sought for or exchanged.‚Äù The American Civil Liberties Union filed a brief for Latham, stating that the law is unconstitutional because it makes it a crime for an adult to ask another adult to engage in legal conduct.

That is, it fits a model :\\\\hat{y} = \\\\hat{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\hat{b} + \\\\sum_i x_i where each of the x_i are binary variables, perhaps multiplied with an arbitrary weight. Contrast this with the more common multiple regression model, where each predictor has its own estimated coefficient: :\\\\hat{y} = \\\\hat{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\hat{b} + \\\\sum_i \\\\hat{w}_i x_i In the social sciences, unit-weighted regression is sometimes used for binary classification, i.e. to predict a yes-no answer where \\\\hat{y} < 0 indicates \\"no\\", \\\\hat{y} \\\\ge 0 \\"yes\\". It is easier to interpret than multiple linear regression (known as linear discriminant analysis in the classification case).  Unit weights  Unit-weighted regression is a method of robust regression that proceeds in three steps. First, predictors for the outcome of interest are selected; ideally, there should be good empirical or theoretical reasons for the selection. Second, the predictors are converted to a standard form. Finally, the predictors are added together, and this sum is called the variate, which is used as the predictor of the outcome. = Burgess method = The Burgess method was first presented by the sociologist Ernest W. Burgess in a 1928 study to determine success or failure of inmates placed on parole. First, he selected 21 variables believed to be associated with parole success. Next, he converted each predictor to the standard form of zero or one (Burgess, 1928). When predictors had two values, the value associated with the target outcome was coded as one. Burgess selected success on parole as the target outcome, so a predictor such as a history of theft was coded as \\"yes\\" = 0 and \\"no\\" = 1. These coded values were then added to create a predictor score, so that higher scores predicted a better chance of success. The scores could possibly range from zero (no predictors of success) to 21 (all 21 predictors scored as predicting success). For predictors with more than two values, the Burgess method selects a cutoff score based on subjective judgment. As an example, a study using the Burgess method (Gottfredson & Snyder, 2005) selected as one predictor the number of complaints for delinquent behavior. With failure on parole as the target outcome, the number of complaints was coded as follows: \\"zero to two complaints\\" = 0, and \\"three or more complaints\\" = 1 (Gottfredson & Snyder, 2005. p. 18). = Kerby method = The Kerby method is similar to the Burgess method, but differs in two ways. First, while the Burgess method uses subjective judgment to select a cutoff score for a multi-valued predictor with a binary outcome, the Kerby method uses classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. In this way, the selection of the cutoff score is based not on subjective judgment, but on a statistical criterion, such as the point where the chi-square value is a maximum. The second difference is that while the Burgess method is applied to a binary outcome, the Kerby method can apply to a multi-valued outcome, because CART analysis can identify cutoff scores in such cases, using a criterion such as the point where the t-value is a maximum. Because CART analysis is not only binary, but also recursive, the result can be that a predictor variable will be divided again, yielding two cutoff scores. The standard form for each predictor is that a score of one is added when CART analysis creates a partition. One study (Kerby, 2003) selected as predictors the five traits of the Big five personality traits, predicting a multi-valued measure of suicidal ideation. Next, the personality scores were converted into standard form with CART analysis. When the CART analysis yielded one partition, the result was like the Burgess method in that the predictor was coded as either zero or one. But for the measure of neuroticism, the result was two cutoff scores. Because higher neuroticism scores correlated with more suicidal thinking, the two cutoff scores led to the following coding: \\"low Neuroticism\\" = 0, \\"moderate Neuroticism\\" = 1, \\"high Neuroticism\\" = 2 (Kerby, 2003). = z-score method = Another method can be applied when the predictors are measured on a continuous scale. In such a case, each predictor can be converted into a standard score, or z-score, so that all the predictors have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. With this method of unit- weighted regression, the variate is a sum of the z-scores (e.g., Dawes, 1979; Bobko, Roth, & Buster, 2007).  Literature review  The first empirical study using unit-weighted regression is widely considered to be a 1928 study by sociologist Ernest W. Burgess. He used 21 variables to predict parole success or failure, and the results suggest that unit weights are a useful tool in making decisions about which inmates to parole. Of those inmates with the best scores, 98% did in fact succeed on parole; and of those with the worst scores, only 24% did in fact succeed (Burgess, 1928). The mathematical issues involved in unit-weighted regression were first discussed in 1938 by Samuel Stanley Wilks, a leading statistician who had a special interest in multivariate analysis. Wilks described how unit weights could be used in practical settings, when data were not available to estimate beta weights. For example, a small college may want to select good students for admission. But the school may have no money to gather data and conduct a standard multiple regression analysis. In this case, the school could use several predictors‚Äîhigh school grades, SAT scores, teacher ratings. Wilks (1938) showed mathematically why unit weights should work well in practice. Frank Schmidt (1971) conducted a simulation study of unit weights. His results showed that Wilks was indeed correct and that unit weights tend to perform well in simulations of practical studies. Robyn Dawes (1979) discussed the use of unit weights in applied studies, referring to the robust beauty of unit weighted models. Jacob Cohen also discussed the value of unit weights and noted their practical utility. Indeed, he wrote, \\"As a practical matter, most of the time, we are better off using unit weights\\" (Cohen, 1990, p. 1306). Dave Kerby (2003) showed that unit weights compare well with standard regression, doing so with a cross validation study‚Äîthat is, he derived beta weights in one sample and applied them to a second sample. The outcome of interest was suicidal thinking, and the predictor variables were broad personality traits. In the cross validation sample, the correlation between personality and suicidal thinking was slightly stronger with unit-weighted regression (r = .48) than with standard multiple regression (r = .47). Gottfredson and Snyder (2005) compared the Burgess method of unit-weighted regression to other methods, with a construction sample of N = 1,924 and a cross-validation sample of N = 7,552. Using the Pearson point-biserial, the effect size in the cross validation sample for the unit-weights model was r = .392, which was somewhat larger than for logistic regression (r = .368) and predictive attribute analysis (r = .387), and less than multiple regression only in the third decimal place (r = .397). In a review of the literature on unit weights, Bobko, Roth, and Buster (2007) noted that \\"unit weights and regression weights perform similarly in terms of the magnitude of cross- validated multiple correlation, and empirical studies have confirmed this result across several decades\\" (p. 693). Andreas Graefe applied an equal weighting approach to nine established multiple regression models for forecasting U.S. presidential elections. Across the ten elections from 1976 to 2012, equally weighted predictors reduced the forecast error of the original regression models on average by four percent. An equal-weights model that includes all variables provided calibrated forecasts that reduced the error of the most accurate regression model by 29% percent.  Example  An example may clarify how unit weights can be useful in practice. Brenna Bry and colleagues (1982) addressed the question of what causes drug use in adolescents. Previous research had made use of multiple regression; with this method, it is natural to look for the best predictor, the one with the highest beta weight. Bry and colleagues noted that one previous study had found that early use of alcohol was the best predictor. Another study had found that alienation from parents was the best predictor. Still another study had found that low grades in school were the best predictor. The failure to replicate was clearly a problem, a problem that could be caused by bouncing betas. Bry and colleagues suggested a different approach: instead of looking for the best predictor, they looked at the number of predictors. In other words, they gave a unit weight to each predictor. Their study had six predictors: 1) low grades in school, 2) lack of affiliation with religion, 3) early age of alcohol use, 4) psychological distress, 5) low self-esteem, and 6) alienation from parents. To convert the predictors to standard form, each risk factor was scored as absent (scored as zero) or present (scored as one). For example, the coding for low grades in school were as follows: \\"C or higher\\" = 0, \\"D or F\\" = 1. The results showed that the number of risk factors was a good predictor of drug use: adolescents with more risk factors were more likely to use drugs. The model used by Bry and colleagues was that drug users do not differ in any special way from non-drug users. Rather, they differ in the number of problems they must face. \\"The number of factors an individual must cope with is more important than exactly what those factors are\\" (p. 277). Given this model, unit-weighted regression is an appropriate method of analysis.  Beta weights  In standard multiple regression, each predictor is multiplied by a number that is called the beta weight, regression weight or weighted regression coefficients (denoted Œ≤W or BW). The prediction is obtained by adding these products along with a constant. When the weights are chosen to give the best prediction by some criterion, the model referred to as a proper linear model. Therefore, multiple regression is a proper linear model. By contrast, unit- weighted regression is called an improper linear model.  Model specification  Standard multiple regression hinges on the assumption that all relevant predictors of the outcome are included in the regression model. This assumption is called model specification. A model is said to be specified when all relevant predictors are included in the model, and all irrelevant predictors are excluded from the model. In practical settings, it is rare for a study to be able to determine all relevant predictors a priori. In this case, models are not specified and the estimates for the beta weights suffer from omitted variable bias. That is, the beta weights may change from one sample to the next, a situation sometimes called the problem of the bouncing betas. It is this problem with bouncing betas that makes unit-weighted regression a useful method.  See also  *Linear regression *Regression analysis *Robust regression  References  *Bobko, P., Roth, P.

Catalogus veteres affixarum longitudines, ac latitudines conferens cum novis, 1612 Biography Born in Hall in Tirol, in 1580 Christoph Grienberger joined the Jesuits. He studied in Prague and Vienna, and subsequently succeeded his tutor, Christopher Clavius, as professor of mathematics at the Collegio Romano in 1612. In 1610, Jesuit and high church officials had turned to Grienberger, as well as Clavius, Paolo Lembo, and Odo Van Maelcote, the other mathematicians on the faculty of the Collegio Romano, for their opinion on the new phenomena Galileo had discovered with his telescope. Grienberger sympathized with Galileo's theory of motion. However, he was asked to defend the Aristotelian view of the universe by Claudio Acquaviva, the Father General of the Jesuits. Grienberger was not a prolific author‚Äìin his lifetime, his name was attached only to a thin volume of star-charts and a set of trigonometric tables-but he occupied a post that allowed him to review and evaluate the works of many other authors. As technical censor of all mathematical works written by Jesuit authors, Grienberger often sent authors his own corrections and calculations, which he recommended that they incorporate before their works could be published. His contemporaries acknowledged their debt to him. Mario Bettinus, author of Apiaria Universae Philosophiae Mathematicae, an encyclopedic collection of mathematical curiosities, includes in this text the following confession: \\"I have benefited, my Reader, from the mind and industry of the very learned and exceedingly modest man, Grienberger, who, while he would have discovered many marvellous things by himself, preferred to make himself serviceable to other people's inventions and other people's praises\\". Giuseppe Biancani also corresponded with Grienberger, with whom he discussed his doubts over Galileo's assertion that there were mountains on the moon. Grienberger's lectures in astronomy had also prepared fellow Jesuits for missionary work in China. He also worked in the field of optics. Grienberger is buried at Rome.

The light was established in 1848 to warn ships of the dangerous shoals that lie off its coast. It is located inside the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and managed by the 45th Space Wing of the U.S. Air Force with the assistance of the Cape Canaveral Lighthouse Foundation. It is the only fully operational lighthouse that is owned by the United States Air Force. The current lighthouse tower was first erected and lit in 1868 then relocated further inland between 1893-1894. It was originally equipped with a first-order Fresnel lens that was automated in 1967 and then retired from the tower in 1993. History The Cape Canaveral lighthouse was erected to warn mariners of the outlying shoals off its coast. Broken ground and shoals extend northward and northeastward of the lighthouse terminating in the Hetzel and Ohio shoals, which have a depth of and respectively. Hetzel Shoal is located about NE of the lighthouse and Ohio Shoals about southward of Hetzel. In a heavy sea these shoals are marked by breakers, but with smooth sea there is nothing to indicate their locality.United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (1922). \\"U.S. Coast Pilot: Atlantic Coast Section D\\", pg. 122. Government Printing Office, Washington. The land is usually not visible from off these outer shoals. Located closer to the land are the Chester, Bull and Southeast shoals, which are about off the coast of the cape.United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (1900). \\"United States coast pilot: Atlantic coast. Part VII. From Chesapeake Bay entrance to Key West, Part 7\\", pg. 40. Government Printing Office, Washington. =First lighthouse= The current Cape Canaveral Light is not the first lighthouse constructed on Cape Canaveral. On May 21, 1838, the building of the first lighthouse at the cape was requested by Florida territorial delegate Charles Downing. Nathaniel Scobie was appointed as the first lighthouse keeper and oversaw the construction of the lighthouse. The tall white conical brick tower and keeper's dwelling were completed in January 1848 at the cost of $13,300. Its light consisted of 15 Lewis lamps powered by whale oil, each with a 21-inch (530 mm) reflector.\\"Img_0338 (Cape Canaveral Lighthouse Florida heritage marker)\\" .

Cape Canaveral Lighthouse Foundation. Retrieved on 2012-11-13. Sailors heavily criticized the white brick lighthouse with complaints that the light was too weak and too low to be seen before ships were on the reefs near the cape. =Second lighthouse= In 1860, the government approved the construction of a new lighthouse. However, the start of the American Civil War stopped the work on the new tower. The lamps and mechanism of the lighthouse were removed from the tower by Burnham and buried in his orange grove to protect them from Federal raids. At the end of the war, construction resumed on the lighthouse. The chosen replacement tower was made with cast iron plate designed so that it can be disassembled and moved to a new location at a minimal cost, in case the encroaching sea started threatening the lighthouse. The conical tower was lined inside by bricks for stability and insulation. It was situated about from the location of the first tower. The new all-white lighthouse tower was completed in 1868, receiving a first-order Fresnel lens made by Henry-Lepaute and Company of Paris, France that was first lit on May 10, 1868. The lower three levels of the tower served as the living quarters for the keepers and his assistants complete with kitchen, living room and bedrooms. The tower was designed to withstand flooding from storm surges that accompany strong hurricanes by making the entrance to the tower on the third floor, accessible by an outdoor stairway (the ground level door was later added in the 1930s). This was tested in 1871 when a strong storm submerged the station. The lighthouse and its keepers survived but the lamp oil and their drinking water were spoiled by the flood. The old 1848 brick tower next to the 1868 iron tower with a white lantern room, before the latter was moved in 1893 The white lighthouse tower was changed to its signature three black bands and three white bands in 1873, with the lantern room remaining white. Soon after, the iron tower became unbearable to the keepers under the Florida sun and humidity. They built and stayed in makeshift dwellings on the grounds of the lighthouse rather than stay in the oven-like tower. In 1876, funds in the amount of $12,000 were appropriated to construct permanent dwellings for the keepers. =Relocating the lighthouse= By the 1880s, shoreline erosion was feared to be threatening the lighthouse, and the United States Congress appropriated funds to move the lighthouse inland. Initial work to move the tower was started in October 1893. A temporary square black skeletal pyramidal lighthouse was erected to keep that section of the sea lit during the move. The tower had a 4th-order lamp with a focal height of and a visibility of .Office of the Lighthouse Board (1894). \\"List of Lights and Fog Signals of the Atlantic and Gulf Coast of the United States\\". Government Printing Office, Washington. The old tower (1848), which stood next to the new tower for about two decades, was blown up and the rubble was used to prepare a foundation for the lighthouse at the new location. The cast iron tower was dismantled, moved by a tram pulled by mules, and reassembled at the new location about a mile westward together with the keepers' houses. The move took nine months, and the lighthouse was relit at its new location on July 25, 1894. The 1900 Atlantic List of Lights indicated the color of the lantern room, which was probably painted during the move, as black.

The style of the building had an enormous influence on Southern German early Baroque architecture.  History  In 1556, Albert V, Duke of Bavaria granted the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) permission to establish what is now Wilhelmsgymnasium in Munich, thus establishing the order's presence in the city. The collegiate church was only established during the reign of his son William V, Duke of Bavaria, also known as \\"the Pious\\". who was a supporter of the Jesuits' Counter Reformation tenets. The church was finally consecrated in 1597, after fourteen years of construction. When the Jesuits were suppressed and banned from most Catholic territories in Europe, the church came into possession of the Bavarian Royal Family and eventually the State of Bavaria, when Germany became a republic.  Architecture  St Michael's Church, circa 1700 (copperplate engraving by Michael Wening) The High Altar The church was built by William V, Duke of Bavaria between 1583‚Äì97 as a spiritual center for the Counter Reformation.Munich City of the Arts by Hans Nohbauer, pp. 26, 115 The foundation stone was laid in 1585.Germany by Joanna Egert-Romanowska and Ma≈Çgorzata Omilanowska, p. 202 In order to realise his ambitious plans for the church and the adjoining college, Duke William had 87 houses in the best location pulled down, ignoring the protests of the citizens. The church was erected in two stages. In the first stage (1583‚Äì88), the church was built by the model of Il Ges√π in Rome and given a barrel-vaulted roof by an unknown architect, the vault being the largest in the world apart from that of St Peter's Basilica in Rome, spanning freely more than 20 meters. When the church was built, there were doubts about the stability of the vaulting. But it was the tower that collapsed in 1590, destroying the just completed quire. Duke William V took it as a bad omen and so planned to build a much larger church. The second phase of construction continued until the consecration of the church in 1597. Friedrich Sustris built on to the undamaged nave a new quire and a transept and a magnificent facade. The church is 78.2 meters long, 20.3 meters wide and 28.2 meters high. The facade is impressive and contains standing statues of Duke Wilhelm and earlier rulers of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty, cast in bronze, in the form of a family tree. Hubert Gerhard's large bronze statue between the two entrances shows the Archangel Michael fighting for the Faith and killing the Evil in the shape of a humanoid demon. The interior is a representation of the triumph of Roman Catholicism in Bavaria during the Counter-Reformation. The heavily indented chancel arch as well as the short side aisles and even the side chapels are designed as a triumphal arch to ancient model. A very deep choir room adjoins the mighty nave. The stucco decoration of the nave represents the life of Jesus Christ. The altarpiece \\"Annunciation\\" was created by Peter Candid (1587). The sculpture of the holy angel in the nave from Hubert Gerhard (1595) was originally intended for the tomb of William V, which was not completed. Having suffered severe damage during the Second World War, the church was restored in 1946‚Äì48. Finally, between 1980 and 1983, the stucco-work was restored. The spire which lost its steepletop in World War II is situated further north next to the former convent.  Burial places  Monument to Eug√®ne de Beauharnais by Bertel Thorwaldsen. King Ludwig II Crypt. The church crypt contains the tomb of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. A monument was erected by Bertel Thorwaldsen in 1830 in the church. Eug√®ne was the son of Josephine de Beauharnais, Napoleon's wife and her first husband, general Alexandre de Beauharnais. He married a daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria in 1806 and was created Duke of Leuchtenberg in 1817. In the right transept, there is a cross monument of Giovanni da Bologna.

It may also be called mother dough. A pre- ferment and a longer fermentation in the bread-making process have several benefits: there is more time for yeast, enzyme and, if sourdough, bacterial actions on the starch and proteins in the dough; this in turn improves the keeping time of the baked bread, and it creates greater complexities of flavor. Though pre-ferments have declined in popularity as direct additions of yeast in bread recipes have streamlined the process on a commercial level, pre-ferments of various forms are widely used in artisanal bread recipes and formulas. Classifications In general, there are two pre-ferment varieties: sponges, based on baker's yeast, and the starters of sourdough, based on wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. There are several kinds of pre-ferment commonly named and used in bread baking. They all fall on a varying process and time spectrum, from a mature mother dough of many generations of age to a first-generation sponge based on a fresh batch of baker's yeast: *Biga and poolish or pouliche are terms used in Italian and French baking, respectively, for sponges made with domestic baker's yeast. Poolish is a fairly wet sponge (typically one-to-one, this is, made with a one-part-flour-to-one-part-water ratio by weight), and it is called biga liquida, whereas the \\"normal\\" biga is usually drier. Bigas can be held longer at their peak than wetter sponges, while a poolish is one known technique to increase a dough's extensibility. *Sourdough starter is likely the oldest, being reliant on organisms present in the grain and local environment. In general, these starters have fairly complex microbiological makeups, the most notable including wild yeasts, lactobacillus, and acetobacteria in symbiotic relationship referred to as a SCOBY. They are often maintained over long periods of time. For example, the Boudin Bakery in San Francisco has used the same starter dough for over 150 years. A roughly synonymous term in French baking is levain. *Mother dough often refers to a sourdough, and in this context the term starter often refers to all or a piece of mother dough; however, mother dough may also refer to a first-generation yeast sponge; so the process used in relation to the ingredients and fermentation times is important to understanding yeast versus sourdough methods. A roughly synonymous term used in French baking is Chef. *Old dough (p√¢te ferment√©e) may be made with yeast or sourdough cultures, and in essence consists of a piece of dough reserved from a previous batch, with more flour and water added to feed the remaining flora. Because this is a piece of old dough, it has the typical ingredient of salt to distinguish it from other pre-ferments. Once old dough had rested for an additional 10 hours of age, the French named it Levain de Chef. History The common, but undocumented, origin given for the term poolish is that it was first used by Polish bakers around 1840, hence its name, and as a method was brought to France in the beginning of the 1920s. \\"Poolish\\" however is an old English version of \\"Polish\\", whereas the term seems to be most used in France (where \\"polonais\\" is the word for \\"Polish\\"). Some nineteenth-century sources use the homophone \\"pouliche\\", a French word that typically means a filly. With either spelling, the term only appears in French sources towards the last part of the nineteenth century. There is not currently any credible explanation for the origin of the term. Use A pre-ferment is easy to make and usually consists of a simple mixture of wheat flour, water, and a leavening agent (typically yeast). Two schools of thought exist regarding the inclusion of salt or sugar. They both act to inhibit or slow yeast growth, as determined by time to proof or rise, See Figures 3.13 & 3.14. so they are not usually included and instead are added to the final dough. Ultimately, the amounts of each ingredient, and when they are added, depend on pre-ferment and final-dough formulas. In some countries (mainly Eastern Europe, Baltic and Nordic countries) rye flour is also used to make a starter. Traditional Finnish rye starter consists of only rye flour and water, no sugar or yeast. Some might also use yogurt to help hasten the starter to rise. When expressed as a bakers' percentage, 50 parts of flour added to 50 parts of water or 1-to-1 is 100% hydration, and results in a relatively fluid pre-ferment. Stiffer doughs such as 50% hydration or 2-to-1, may also be used. After mixing it is allowed to ferment for a period of time, and then is added to the final dough as a substitute for or in addition to more yeast. There are distinctly different brew types of pre- ferments designed for computer-controlled bakeries that use a rather different series of ingredients, including oxidizers, needed for continuous dough- production processes. Fermentation is sometimes performed in a warm place, or a humidity- and temperature-controlled environment. Cooler-than-room or refrigeration temperatures decelerate growth and increase the time interval, while slightly warmer temperatures accelerate growth and decrease the time interval. Too warm a temperature slows growth, while even higher temperatures will kill the yeast. Death of the yeast cells occur in the range of . See Figure 148.3. When cooling a levain or sourdough pre-ferment, if the dough temperature drops below it affects the culture and leads to the loss of a particular aroma in the baked bread. To allow room for the pre-ferment to rise, the ingredients are mixed in a container at least four or five times their volume. This is about the point in time when some process similarities of yeast pre-ferments to sourdough or levain starters begins to diverge. The typical amounts of time allotted for the yeast pre-ferment period may range from 2‚Äì16 hours, depending on the dough's temperature and the added amount of viable yeast, often expressed as a bakers' percentage. Spontaneous sourdough starters take, at a minimum, several days, and are subject to many variables. To make a sourdough starter from scratch, the minimum-needed ingredients are flour, water, and time. This starter is maintained with daily feedings or refreshments of fresh flour and water or, new dough. It ferments at room temperature until the desired age or minimal number of refreshments, following a refreshment schedule that may include acceleration of time intervals leading into the final dough, then is added to the final dough. When maintaining a starter's existing weight, it is advised to discard 60% (or more) of the starter, replacing that discarded dough with new dough. If an increased amount of starter is required, simply add new dough. 40-parts-to-60-parts of old- dough-to-new-dough by weight, or 2-to-3, is known as the back-slopping ratio, and changes to that ratio change the pH of the just-refreshed dough. To make a primary-culture levain, Raymond Calvel used salt, but less of it than would be typical for many final-dough formulas.

Dolgov died while carrying out a high-altitude parachute jump from a Volga balloon gondola.Dolgov's year of death is given as both 1961 and 1962 by the Encyclopedia Astronautica, but as 1962 by Goebel and at warheroes.ru. 1962 is correct, as shown by the Der Spiegel obituary cited below. Early life and career Dolgov was born into a family of farmers in the village of Bogoyavlenskoye (now Dolgovo) in Zemetchinsky District, Penza Oblast. He served with the Soviet airborne in World War II. In January 1945, Dolgov became a company commander in the 350th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 114th Guards Rifle Division. Dolgov participated in the Budapest Offensive and the Vienna Offensive. On 6 April, Dolgov reportedly knocked out a self-propelled gun and killed 40 German soldiers. He was wounded but allegedly refused to leave the battlefield. Dolgov graduated from the Ryazan Higher Airborne Command School in 1947. He reportedly designed the ejection seats for the Vostok spacecraft. Death On 1 November 1962, Dolgov and Yevgeni Nikolayevich Andreyev ascended in a Volga balloon gondola from Volsk, near Saratov, to make high-altitude parachute jumps. Andreyev successfully completed his jump. Dolgov, testing an experimental pressure suit, jumped at 28,640 metres (93,970 ft). The helmet visor of Dolgov's pressure suit hit part of the gondola as he exited, and the suit depressurized, killing him. On 12 December 1962, Dolgov was posthumously named a Hero of the Soviet Union. If Dolgov's jump had been successful, he still would not have exceeded the record set by Joseph Kittinger for the highest-altitude parachute jump in history (31,300 metres, 16 August 1960). The current world record is held by Alan Eustace (41,425 metres, 24 October 2014). Legacy At the time of Dolgov's death, the Soviet Army newspaper Red Star announced that he had died in the course of \\"carrying out his duties\\". Over the years there have been false reports that Dolgov actually died on 11 October 1960, in a failed flight of a Vostok spacecraft. A fictionalized version of Dolgov's death (incorrectly dated in February 1961) appears in the short story \\"The Chief Designer\\" by Andy Duncan, which was published in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine and was a Hugo finalist.

The film was produced by the Beatles manager Allen Klein of ABKCO Music and Records, after Jodorowsky scored an underground phenomenon with El Topo and the acclaim of both John Lennon and George Harrison (Lennon and Yoko Ono put up production money). It was shown at various international film festivals in 1973, including Cannes, and limited screenings in New York and San Francisco. Plot A man (later identified as the thief), representing The Fool tarot card, lies in the desert with flies covering his face. He is befriended by a footless, handless dwarf representing the Five of Swords, and the pair travel into the city where they make money entertaining tourists. Because the thief resembles Jesus Christ in appearance, some locals ‚Äî a nun and three warriors ‚Äî cast an impression of his body and sell the resulting crucifixes. After a dispute with a priest, the thief eats off the face of his wax statue and sends it skyward with balloons, symbolically eating the body of Christ and offering \\"himself\\" up to Heaven. Soon after, he notices a crowd gathered around a tall tower, where a large hook with a bag of gold has been sent down in exchange for food. The thief, wishing to find the source of the gold, ascends the tower. There he finds the alchemist and his silent female assistant. After a confrontation with the alchemist, the thief defecates into a container. The excrement is transformed into gold by the alchemist, who proclaims: \\"You are excrement. You can change yourself into gold.\\" The thief accepts the gold, but smashes a mirror with the gold when shown his reflection. The alchemist then takes the thief as an apprentice. The thief is introduced to seven people who will accompany him on his journey. Each is introduced as a personification of one of the planets, in particular the negative characteristics that are associated with his or her planet. They consist of a cosmetics manufacturer representing Venus, a weapons manufacturer representing Mars, a millionaire art dealer representing Jupiter, a war toy maker representing Saturn, a political financial adviser representing Uranus, a police chief representing Neptune, and an architect representing Pluto. The alchemist instructs the seven to burn their money as well as wax images of themselves. Together with the alchemist, the thief, and the alchemist's assistant, they form a group of ten. The characters are led by the alchemist through various transformation rituals. The ten journey by boat to \\"Lotus Island\\" in order to gain the secret of immortality from nine immortal masters who live on a holy mountain. Once on Lotus Island they are sidetracked by the Pantheon Bar, a cemetery party where people have abandoned their quest for the holy mountain and instead engage in drugs, poetry, or acts of physical prowess. Leaving the bar behind, they ascend the mountain. Each has a personal symbolic vision representing his or her worst fears and obsessions. Near the top, the thief is sent back to his \\"people\\" along with a young prostitute and an ape who have followed him from the city to the mountain. The rest confront the cloaked immortals, who are shown to be only faceless dummies. The alchemist then breaks the fourth wall with the command \\"Zoom back, camera!\\" and reveals the film apparatus (cameras, microphones, lights, and crew) just outside the frame. He instructs everyone, including the audience of the film, to leave the holy mountain: \\"Goodbye Holy Mountain, Real life awaits us.\\" Cast Production =Inspiration= The film is based on Ascent of Mount Carmel by John of the Cross and Mount Analogue by Ren√© Daumal, who was a student of George Gurdjieff. In this film, much of Jodorowsky's visually psychedelic story follows the metaphysical thrust of Mount Analogue. This is revealed in such events as the climb to the alchemist, the assembly of individuals with specific skills, the discovery of the mountain that unites Heaven and Earth \\"that cannot not exist\\", and symbolic challenges along the mountain ascent. Daumal died before finishing his allegorical novel, and Jodorowsky's improvised ending provides a way of completing the work (both symbolically and otherwise). =Preparation= Before the principal photography would commence, Jodorowsky and his wife spent a week without sleep under the direction of a Japanese Zen master. The central members of the cast spent three months doing various spiritual exercises guided by Oscar Ichazo of the Arica Institute. The Arica training features Zen, Sufi and yoga exercises along with eclectic concepts drawn from the Kabbalah, the I Ching and the teachings of George Gurdjieff. After the training, the group lived for one month communally in Jodorowsky's home before production. Thereafter, the filming started in early 1972. The film was shot sequentially, entirely in Mexico, at a budget of $750,000. Jodorowsky was also instructed by Ichazo to take LSD for the purpose of spiritual exploration. He also administered psilocybin mushrooms to the actors during the shooting of the death-rebirth scene. Release The film was completed just in time for the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, where it was much awaited. Jodorowsky edited out twenty minutes of dialogue from the film, with the intention of removing as much dialogue as he could. The film had its premiere at Waverly Theatre, an art house movie theater in New York City on November 29, 1973, where it had restricted run at midnights on Friday and Saturday for sixteen months. It was also shown at Filmex on March 30, 1974, which was described as the \\"American premiere.\\" At a few places it was released as a double bill with Jodorowsky's 1970 film, El Topo, and eventually became a cult film with its influence on popular culture. In 2010, the Alamo Drafthouse held a screening of The Holy Mountain as part of their \\"High for the Holidays\\" event. To commemorate this event, a limited-edition movie poster was designed by German artist Florian Bertmer. Home media The film was not given a wide release until over 30 years following its original premiere, when a restored print was shown in Cannes on 23 May 2006.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016.\\"Diocese of Nola\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016. Its seat is the Campanian city of Nola, now a suburb of Naples. Its cathedral is dedicated to the Assumption (). The dedication was originally to S. Stephen, the Protomartyr, but after the second reconstruction the dedication was changed to the Assumption.Cappelletti, p. 564. It is traditionally credited with the introduction of the use of bells into Christian worship. History =Antiquity= The diocese was founded in the 3rd century by D'Avino, p. 489: \\"La sede vescovile fu eretta nel secolo terzo, e da Alessandro III dichiarata suffraganea di Napoli.\\" He was martyred, as were St Januarius's companions Reparatus, Faustillus, and Acacius.D'Avino, p. 489: \\"Ne fu primo vescovo S. Felice seniore di Nola verso il 254, zelante promulgatore della fede. Govern√≤ la sua Chiesa cinque anni, e fu martirizzato con trenta dei suoi compagni sotto il prefetto Marciano, durante la persecuzione di Valeriano ai 15 novembre.\\" The early center of worship was at Cimitile, outside Nola proper and now named for its cemetery.Ebanista and Fusaro, \\"Il complesso basilicale,\\" in: C. Ebanista; F. Fusaro (2005), Cimitile. Guida al complesso basilicale e alla citt√†, pp. 19-105. The basilica of St Felix Martyr was built by Bishop Paulinus in the late 4th or early 5th century.Ebanista and Fusaro, p. 47: \\"La complessa stratificazione haavuto origine alla fine del III secolo, quando S. Felice fu sepolto in una semplice tomba in laterizi.... Intorno alla met√† del IV secolo, ad est dell'aula fu realizzata una basilica a tre navate con abside ad est (basilica orientale). Tra il 401 e il 403, Paolino di Nola, demolita l'abside dell'aula ad corpus, costru√¨ una triplice apertura (triforium) che consentiva l'accesso all'atrio di un nuovo e pi√π grande edificio di culto che egli chiam√≤ basilica nova.\\" Paulinus is traditionally credited with the introduction of bells into Christian ritual, whence two major medieval forms became known as s and s.. The information is stated to be derived from Polydore Vergil (c. 1470‚Äì1555), hardly \\"traditionally credited\\", as claimed. Felix's remains, and then Paulinus's own, made the site a focus of Christian pilgrimage. (Paulinus's body was removed to the neighboring diocese of Benevento in 839, traded to the emperor in 1000, and finally restored to Nola in 1909.) Around 505, the mythical Bishop Paulinus IIILanzoni, p. 237. supposedly enslaved himself to free a widow's son. Several buildings were restored under Bishop Lupicinus around 786. =Middle Ages= In 1370, Bishop Francesco Scaccani began construction of the present Gothic cathedral, which was completed by Gian Antonio Boccarelli in 1469. The cathedral was administered and serviced by a Chapter, composed of four dignities (the Dean, the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, and the Cantor) and sixteen Canons. In addition, there was a Theologus and a Penitentiarius, in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent; they held prebends, but did not have a vote in the Chapter. There were also twelve beneficed clergy.D'Avino, p. 490, column 2. Ritzler-Sefrin V, p. 291, note 1. In 1918, the Chapter had three dignities (Dean, Precentor, and Treasurer) and 7 Canons; there were eight Canons de numero.Orbis catholicus 1918 (London: The Universe 1918), p. 518. =Renaissance= The seminary was founded by Bishop Antonio Scarampi (1549‚Äì1569), introducing the reforms decreed by the Council of Trent. Bishop Traiano Caracciolo constructed a new seminary building in 1738. In 1585, Bishop Fabrizio Gallo (1585‚Äì1614) founded several charitable institutions. In 1588 Gallo held a diocesan synod.Ebanista, \\"et manet\\", p. 259-260. =Modern period= Giambattista Lancellotti, who served as bishop from 1615 to 1656, also served as papal nuncio to Poland from 1622 to 1627.

During his career, he composed scores for over 50 feature films, as well as numerous documentary shorts, radio and television scores, over 100 songs and music for ballet and theatre.  Life  Edward John Clifton Parker was born on 5 February 1905 in London, the youngest son of a bank manager. He was encouraged by his father to go into commerce but studied music privately and composed his first published work, Romance for violin and piano, when aged sixteen. In 1924, he decided to divide his names-- to use 'Edward John' for lighter compositions and 'Clifton Parker' for more serious compositions. However, he never used the former. He obtained an ARCM diploma in piano teaching at the Royal Academy of Music in 1926 and abandoned his career in commerce and became a music copyist. By the mid 1930s he was achieving success with some of his classical pieces and managed to get his work accepted for broadcast on the BBC, work such as In a Twilight Dim with Rose. He came to the attention of Muir Mathieson, one of the music pioneers of the British film industry. His early film compositions were uncredited, including the 1942 No√´l Coward film In Which We Serve and it was only with his 1944 score for Western Approaches that his name finally attracted attention. The 1950s were a prolific period, with Parker composing for many mediums, especially film. However, in 1963 he was one of three composers, the others being William Alwyn and Franz Reizenstein, who abandoned scoring film music in protest of the exorbitant percentage of royalties taken by the publishers. Parker was married twice. His second wife, Yoma Sasburg, was principal dancer in a number of his ballet productions. He was the father of Julia Clifton Parker, better known as writer Julia Stoneham. He was inactive for the final 13 years of his life owing to ulcers and emphysema, and he died on 2 September 1989, aged 84, in Marlow.  Works  Clifton Parker wrote the music for many feature films, and is much admired for his \\"lively symphonic style\\". Although most of his scores are missing, presumed destroyed, several have been reconstructed by Philip Lane and have been released on a Chandos Records CD, performed by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. Notable scores include: * Western Approaches (1943) * This Happy Breed (1944) * Johnny Frenchman (1945) * Blanche Fury (1948) * Poet's Pub (1949) * The Blue Lagoon (1949) * Treasure Island (1950) * The Wooden Horse (1950) - finest scoring of credits * Life in Her Hands (1951) * The Story of Robin Hood (1951) * The Sword and the Rose (1952) * Single Handed (1953) * Night of the Demon (1957) * Campbell's Kingdom (1957) * Sea of Sand (1958) * The 39 Steps (1959) * Sink the Bismarck! (1960) * A Circle of Deception (1960) * The Hellfire Club (1961) * Taste of Fear (1961) * The Treasure of Monte Cristo (1961) * Girl on Approval (1961) * H.M.S. Defiant (U.S. release: Damn the Defiant!) (1962) * Mystery Submarine (1963) * The Informers (1963) Parker also composed for documentaries, including four British Transport Films; Elizabethan Express (1954), Long Night Haul (1956), Blue Pullman (1960) and Ocean Terminal (1952/1961). His work as war documentary composer was honoured at the Imperial War Museum in 2003 with special screenings of Battle Is Our Business (1942), Towards the Offensive (1944) and Western Approaches (1943). He also scored the incidental music to an episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary War in the Air (1954). Parker wrote prolifically for the stage, notably for the Old Vic theatre, R.A.D.A. and the Hampstead Theatre Club. His scores include incidental music for a dramatic adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace; The Glass Slipper, based on Cinderella and The Silver Curlew based on Rumplestiltskin. He co-wrote 103 songs during his career, mainly for stage revues. He also wrote an opera Pyatigorsk in 1973. In light music circles, Parker's overture to the play The Glass Slipper is now well known, although it was many years before it became available on a commercial recording. Much of Parker's concert music is now either lost or neglected, although some pieces are preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Parker also composed a number of choral works, particularly later in his life, including Nocturnes for the King's Singers and a Missa Brevis in 1976.

They sought refuge in the Christian Kingdom of Aksum, present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea (formerly referred to as Abyssinia, an ancient name whose origin is debated), in or . The Aksumite monarch who received them is known in Islamic sources as the Negus ( najƒÅ≈°ƒ´) Ashama ibn Abjar. Modern historians have alternatively identified him with King Armah and Ella Tsaham. Some of the exiles returned to Mecca and made the hijra to Medina with Muhammad, while others remained in Abyssinia until they came to Medina in 628. Background According to the traditional view, members of the early Muslim community in Mecca faced persecution, which prompted Muhammad to advise them to seek refuge in Abyssinia. The earliest extant account is given in Ibn Ishaq's sira: Another view, grounded in the political developments of the time, suggests that following the Sassanid capture of Jerusalem in 614 many believers saw a potential danger to the community as they were not the partisans of the Persians who both practiced Zoroastrianism and had earlier supported the Arabian Jews of Himyar. The acceptance of these Muslims into the Kingdom of Axum at precisely a moment of Persian triumph in the Levant recalls the Ethiopian foreign policy of the previous century which saw Axum and Persia compete for influence in the Arabian Peninsula. Bowersock, G.W (Dr). The Throne of Adulis: Red Sea Wars on the Eve of Islam. Oxford University Press, 2013. The migration(s) According to Muslims historians, there were two migrations, although there are differences of opinion with respect to the dates.Rafiq Zakaria, 1991, Muhammad and The Quran, New Delhi: Penguin Books, pp. 403-4. The first group of emigrants, comprising eleven men and four women, was granted asylum in the year ( according to other sources) under Ashama ibn-Abjar, the ruler of the Kingdom of Aksum. This group included Muhammad's daughter Ruqayyah and his son-in-law Uthman ibn Affan, who later became the third caliph. Mohammed chose Uthman bin Maz'oon, one of his most important companions, as the leader of this group. According to Tabqat Ibn Sa'd the group boarded a merchant ship from the sea port of Shu'aiba and paid half dinar each for the sea crossing. After a year the exiles heard rumors that the Quraysh had accepted Islam, which prompted them to return to Mecca. Confronted with the reality, they set out to Abyssinia again in ( according to other sources), this time accompanied by others, 83 men and 18 women in all. S. M. Darsh argues that the decision to return was motivated by a change of Meccan strategy toward Muslims, which temporarily created a more favorable environment for them in Mecca, as well as by a rebellion against the Abyssinian king.S.M. Darsh, Western historians, such as Leone Caetani and Montgomery Watt have questioned the account of two migrations. Although Ibn Ishaq provides two partially overlapping lists of migrants, he does not mention that the first group returned and went back a second time. Watt argues that the word used by Ibn Ishaq (tatƒÅba‚Äòa - lit. followed one after another) and the order of the names on the lists suggests that the migration may have taken place in a number of smaller groups rather than two large parties, while the appearance of the two lists reflected the controversies surrounding assignment of priority on official registers during the reign of the second caliph Umar. In Abyssinia Events that took place after the emigration are reported by Ibn Ishaq. When the Quraysh learned that Muhammad's companions could safely practice their religion in Abyssinia, they decided to send an embassy to the Negus to demand return of the fugitives. They selected two envoys, ‚ÄòAmr ibn al-‚ÄòAs and Abdullah bin Rabiah, and gave them gifts for the king and his generals. The gifts were made up of leather prepared by fine skin. (ba·π≠ƒÅriqa). The Meccans appealed to the generals, arguing that the emigrants were \\"foolish youths\\" who invented a new religion the likes of which neither the Meccans nor the Abyssinians had heard of and that their relatives were asking for their return. The king granted them audience, but he refused to hand over people who had sought his protection until he heard their side of the story. The Muslims were brought in front of the Negus (or \\"al-Najashi\\" in Arabic) and his bishops. Ja‚Äòfar ibn Abƒ´ TƒÅlib, who acted as the leader of the exiles, spoke in their defense. He described to the king how they lived before Islam, Muhammad's prophetic mission, and what he had taught them. He also spoke of the persecution they had faced at the hands of the Quraysh. The king asked if they had with them anything which had come from God. When Ja‚Äòfar confirmed, the king commanded him to read it. Ja‚Äòfar then recited a passage from Surah Maryam (Chapter of Mary). When the king heard it, he wept and exclaimed: \\"verily, this and what Jesus brought (Gospel) has come from the same source of light (mi≈°kƒÅt)\\". He then affirmed that he would never give up the Muslims. However, one of the envoys, ‚ÄòAmr ibn al-‚ÄòAs, thought of another tactic. On the following day he returned to the king and told him that the Muslims had said a dreadful thing about Jesus. When the Muslims heard that the king summoned them again to question them about their view of Jesus, they tried to find a diplomatic answer, but finally decided to speak according to the revelation they had received. When the king addressed Ja‚Äòfar, he replied that they held Jesus to be \\"God's servant, His prophet, His spirit, and His word which He cast upon the virgin Mary\\". Muslim account states that upon hearing these words, the Negus declared that Jesus was indeed no more than what he had said. He turned to the Muslims and told them: \\"go, for you are safe in my country.\\" He then returned the gifts to the envoys and dismissed them. Based on the timeframe of the hijra, it is presumed that the Negus was King Armah. End of exile Many of the Abyssinian exiles returned to Mecca in 622 and made the hegira to Medina with Muhammad, while a second wave went to Medina in 628. First migration list The first list of emigrants reported by Ibn Ishaq included the following eleven men and four women: *Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas *Jahsh ibn RiyabHe is father of Zainab and a father-in-law of Muhammad. In some accounts relating to Sahabahs in China, he (Jahsh) is noted as Geys.

Prison Break is an American serial drama television series that premiered on the Fox network on August 29, 2005, and finished its fifth season on May 30, 2017. The series was simulcast on Global in Canada, and broadcast in dozens of countries worldwide. Prison Break is produced by Adelstein- Parouse Productions, in association with Rat Television, Original Television and 20th Century Fox Television. The series revolves around two brothers: Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell). In the first season, Lincoln is sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, and Michael deliberately incarcerates himself to help him escape prison. Season two focuses on the manhunt of the prison escapees, season three revolves around Michael's breakout from a Panamanian jail, the fourth season unravels the criminal conspiracy that imprisoned Lincoln, and the fifth season focuses on breaking Michael out of a prison in Yemen and uncovering the conspiracy that forced Michael to fake his death and change his identity. A total of 90 episodes of Prison Break have been aired, in addition to three special making-of episodes. The first season aired from August 29, 2005 to May 15, 2006, with a four-month break after Thanksgiving. The second season, which premiered on August 21, 2006, had a similar schedule as the first, although it had a shorter break. After an eight-week hiatus, the second season resumed on January 22, 2007 before ending on April 2, 2007. The third season began on September 17, 2007, with an eight-episode run. The show's third season went on hiatus over the 2007 Christmas period because of the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike. It resumed on January 14, 2008, and the last five episodes of the season were aired. The fourth season, consisting of 22 episodes, began airing in September 2008, stopped in December 2008, and resumed on April 17, 2009. After being in development for several months, Fox announced in January 2016 that it had ordered a limited event series that would serve as a continuation to the original series. The season premiered on April 4, 2017, on Fox. The first five seasons of Prison Break have been released on DVD and Blu- ray in Regions 1, 2, and 4.

Intuitively, it is a connected chain of points on a graph with alternating colors. History Kempe chains were first used by Alfred Kempe in his attempted proof of the four colour theorem. Even though his proof turned out to be incomplete, the method of Kempe chains is crucial to the successful modern proofs (Appel & Haken, Robertson et al., etc.). Furthermore, the method is used in the proof of the five-colour theorem by Percy John Heawood, a weaker form of the four-colour theorem. Formal definition The term \\"Kempe chain\\" is used in two different but related ways. Suppose G is a graph with vertex set V, and we are given a colouring function : c : V \\\\to S where S is a finite set of colours, containing at least two distinct colours a and b. If v is a vertex with colour a, then the (a, b)-Kempe chain of G containing v is the maximal connected subset of V which contains v and whose vertices are all coloured either a or b. The above definition is what Kempe worked with. Typically the set S has four elements (the four colours of the four colour theorem), and c is a proper colouring, that is, each pair of adjacent vertices in V are assigned distinct colours. A more general definition, which is used in the modern computer-based proofs of the four colour theorem, is the following. Suppose again that G is a graph, with edge set E, and this time we have a colouring function : c : E \\\\to S. If e is an edge assigned colour a, then the (a, b)-Kempe chain of G containing e is the maximal connected subset of E which contains e and whose edges are all coloured either a or b. This second definition is typically applied where S has three elements, say a, b and c, and where V is a cubic graph, that is, every vertex has three incident edges. If such a graph is properly coloured, then each vertex must have edges of three distinct colours, and Kempe chains end up being paths, which is simpler than in the case of the first definition. In terms of maps Application to the four colour theorem In the four color theorem, Kempe was able to prove that all graphs necessarily have a vertex of five or less, or containing a vertex that touches five other vertices, called its neighbors. As such, to prove the four color theorem, Kempe could prove that vertices of five or less were all four-colorable. Kempe was able to prove the case of degree four and give a partial proof of degree five using Kempe chains.Appel, Kenneth; Haken, Wolfgang (1989), Every Planar Map is Four-Colorable, Contemporary Mathematics, 98, With the collaboration of J. Koch., Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society, doi:10.1090/conm/098, , MR 1025335 In this case, Kempe chains are used to prove the idea that no vertex has to be touching four colors different from itself, i.e having a degree of 4. First, one can create a graph with a vertex v and four vertices as neighbors. If we remove the vertex v, we can four-color the remaining vertices. We can set the colors as (in clockwise order) red, yellow, blue, and green. In this situation, there can be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors or a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. Supposing that the Kempe chain is connecting the green and yellow neighbors, red and blue must then necessarily not have a Kempe chain between them. So, when placing the original vertex v back into the graph, we can simply reverse the colors of the red vertex and its neighbors (including the red vertex, making it blue) and coloring vertex v as red. This results in a four-colored graph.Kempe, A. B. (1879), \\"On the Geographical Problem of the Four Colours\\", American Journal of Mathematics, The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2 (3): 193‚Äì220 Other Applications Kempe chains have been used to solve problems in coloring extension.

The titular \\"Strip Mall\\" was the fictional Plaza del Toro. Brown starred as Tammi Tyler, an ex-child actress who at 12 had stabbed her adult co-star to death after eating a cupcake laced with PCP. Now, as an adult, Tammi worked as a waitress at the Funky Fox, a bar located in the Plaza del Toro. One of her fellow employees was Patti the barmaid (Victoria Jackson). In the series premiere, Tammi married the owner of Starbrite Cleaners, Harvey Krudup (Jim O'Heir), who she thought was worth millions, but realized that Starbrite's lone location was at the Plaza. For the rest of the show's run, Tammi would try (unsuccessfully) to end her marriage. Other businesses and main characters Other businesses at the Plaza del Toro included a Chinese restaurant, Wok Don't Run, owned by Fanny Sue Chang (Amy Hill) and Althea (Loretta Fox), both of whom were lesbians; the Good Things gift shop, owned by Rafe (Maxwell Caulfield) and Bettina Bellingham (Eliza Coyle); and We Shoot You Video, which employed two college film graduates Barry (Chris Wylde) and Josh Macintosh (Jonathan Mangum), as well as a porn actress named Hedda Hummer (Allison Dunbar). There was also an insurance agency near the plaza, run by an agent named Dwight (Tim Bagley). Bob Koherr, who had directed Brown in the 1997 movie Plump Fiction, played a biker named Blank and his identical brothers Blair and Blunt. Juan Vidal played Tammi's Latin lover, Fernando, in Season 2. Former Miss Alabama Kim Wimmer played Elyce Cantwell. On the set All twenty episodes of this series were written by the same writers. In addition to Brown and Koherr, episodes of the series were directed by Alan Cohn; Sam Irvin (who also directed Brown in Out There and Fat Rose and Squeaky); and Bobcat Goldthwait (the latter previously worked with Brown in Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful and Shakes the Clown). Frequent guest stars on the series included Stella Stevens, one of several actresses to play Harvey's mom, and Cindy Williams‚Äîlike Brown, a Van Nuys native‚Äîwho played herself in several episodes. Many of the behind-the-scenes crew came from Brown's previous series, Clueless, which was also set in the Los Angeles area. Every episode of this series ended with a cliffhanger. The final episode ended with Tammi being thrown from an airplane by Dwight, who yelled, \\"Goodbye, Tammi Tyler!\\" Brown, who along with Charlie Coffey produced Strip Mall, was about to plan the series' third season when Comedy Central decided to cancel the series because, given the recession at the time, it was too expensive to continue. Strip Mall was one of two Comedy Central sitcoms cancelled in June 2001 due to cost reasons; the other was That's My Bush!

The capitol building is part of the Empire State Plaza complex on State Street in Capitol Park. Housing the New York State Legislature, the building was completed in 1899 at a cost of US$25 million (equivalent to $ million in ), making it the most expensive government building of its time. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, then included as a contributing property when the Lafayette Park Historic District was listed in 1978. The New York State Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1979. and undated photo; 289 KiB History The Old State Capitol, in use from 1812 to 1879 Legislative sessions had been held at different buildings in different places before Albany was declared the State capital in 1797. From that time until 1811, the State Legislature met at the Old Albany City Hall. The first State Capitol was designed by Albany native Philip Hooker, started in 1804, inaugurated in 1812 and remained in use until 1879 when the current building was inaugurated. Thomas Fuller The present Capitol was built between 1867 and 1899. Three teams of architects worked on the design of the Capitol during the 32 years of its construction, managed by: Thomas Fuller (1867‚Äì1875), Leopold Eidlitz and Henry Hobson Richardson (1875‚Äì1883), and Isaac G. Perry (1883‚Äì1899). Fuller, the initial architect, was an Englishman who also designed the Canadian Parliament buildings of Parliament Hill, Ottawa. The state capitol's ground floor was built in the Classical/Romanesque style. Lieutenant Governor William Dorsheimer then dismissed Fuller in favor of Eidlitz and Richardson who built the next two floors in a Renaissance Classical style, noticeable on the exterior two floors as light, open columnwork. The increasing construction costs became an ongoing source of conflict in the legislature, and it was difficult to secure the necessary funding. Eidlitz and Richardson were dismissed by Grover Cleveland upon his election to governorship and his review of the increasing costs of construction. He hired Perry to complete the project. The legislative chambers, the fourth floor and roof work were all finished in Victorian- modified Romanesque that was distinctively Richardson's design. It \\"was Richardson who dominated the final outcome of the grand building, which evolved into his distinguished Romanesque style\\" (which came to be known as Richardsonian Romanesque). It is claimed Richardson was imitating the H√¥tel de Ville (City Hall) in Paris, France. The Chazy limestone for its construction was quarried at the Clark Quarry in Essex County, New York. Note: This includes Capitol building in 1919, photograph taken from Madison Avenue, southwest on hill The central open court is dominated by a shaft intended to support a massive dome. The dome and tower were never completed, as it was found the building's weight was causing stress fractures and making the building shift downhill toward State Street. To stop this movement, a large, long exterior Eastern Staircase was added to support the front facade. The Capitol exterior is made of white granite from Hallowell, Maine, and the building incorporates Westchester marble cut by state prisoners at Sing Sing. The granite structure is 220 feet (67 m) tall at its highest point, and it is one of eleven U.S. state capitols that does not have a domed roof. Tunnels connect it to the Empire State Plaza and Alfred E. Smith Building. The building's exterior underwent restoration from 2000 until fall 2014. The Assembly Chamber was built with the world's largest open arched span. However, this produced very inconvenient acoustic results. A more serious problem was the structure's shifting foundations that made the vaults unstable. A lower false ceiling was introduced to prevent rock shards from the vaults from falling to the assembly floor. The Capitol initially featured two large murals by Boston artist William Morris Hunt painted directly on to the Assembly Chamber's sandstone walls. The two enormous works, named The Flight of Night and The Discoverer, each some 45-feet long, were later covered when the Assembly's vaulted ceiling proved unstable and the ceiling was lowered four feet below the murals. Earlier, the murals had been damaged by moisture in the building and had begun to flake. Plans for later murals by Hunt were abandoned due to lack of funding, and some people have speculated the resulting depression experienced by the artist may have contributed to his suicide. In front of the Capitol is an equestrian sculpture of Civil War General Philip Sheridan, designed by John Quincy Adams Ward and Daniel Chester French and completed in 1916. Visiting and tours The New York State Capitol is open Monday through Friday from 7AM until 7PM. The building is closed most Weekends and Holidays. Official guided tours of the Capitol are Monday through Friday at 10AM, Noon, 2PM and 3PM. Tours begin at the Information Desk located in the State Street Lobby of the Capitol.

History  An ancient fishing settlement situated between Witless Bay and Cape Broyle in a small cove. The earliest record (1636) on a map naming it Abra de Brigas, which translates as the harbour or harbour of turmoil and tides. The name stems from the French word brega of South west France because both Brigus and Brigus South are located in areas of French interest which contain other French names. In the 1960s the name was changed to Hillsdale to distinguish it from Brigus, Conception Bay. Locals refused to acknowledge the new name and it was officially changed back 6 or 7 years later. As the names and dates of various early maps suggest, Brigus South was known by French and Portuguese mariners in the 16th and 17th centuries. The first census of Brigus, then called Bercekus was taken in 1677, listing Richard Koane, John Kent and Nicholas Koane as residents. These families lodged in 3 separate dwellings, had 6 servants lodging with them as well as 43 fishing servants who were employed in the settlement. Bercekus had five stages, seven boats, 4 store houses and the largest number of horses (4) of any settlement from Renooze (Renews) to St. John's and constituted fully one third of all the horses in Newfoundland at the time. It has been conjectured that the earliest settlers of the Community came to Brigus via the earlier settlements of Ferryland and Cape Broyle (1628‚Äì1630) and that there was a permanent settlement in 1700. In 1697 the Abbe Baudior listed 15 soldiers and 3 inhabitants (Richard Coome, John Kent and Nicholas Coome) and in 1705 the Community had 6 families. A cemetery was established and the first person buried there is a child of Jacob Doyle in 1798. A ship called the Hammer, by locals, but officially named The John and Maria, went ashore in Timber Cove in 1857 with the loss of 18 men. All are buried in Brigus Cemetery. The Population reached an all-time high in 1894 with 140 residents. A prominent man from Brigus, Thomas Battcock sat in the Newfoundland House of Assembly, from 1870 to 1873 having been elected as part of Charles Fox Bennett's anti-confederation government. The first School was established in Brigus in 1848 but closed in 1884 due to the state of the building. The salary for the teacher was used to improve the quality of the lodgings. In 1885, the school reopened in a house rented by the School Board, it was purchased in 1859. A Miss Doyle was the teacher at that time. In 1870, a Miss Grace, tutor for the Cashin family of Cape Broyle taught school there. She was retired in 1904 due to her advancing years and given a pension. Mary Battcock taught from 1911 -1916 when Margaret Gregory took over to teach the sixteen students of all grades. The last teacher was Mrs. Annie Hayes 1937 -1967 when the school closed and the children were bussed to school in Cape Broyle. A Chapel was erected in the Community under the direction of Father Michael Kennedy (date unknown).  Economy  The economy was based on small boat inshore fishery and reported a catch of 480 quintals of fish that year. On a census report dated 1697 it was reported that the settlement had \\"No sheep, garden or pasture lands\\" making it likely that it was first used as a fishing station between 1675 and 1677. The first dwellings were built on the East side of the harbour which could not be seen from the ocean. It was a good hideaway from the French and Spanish men of war and Pirate ships.

Thomas took Manuel and the rest of his family to Corfu after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the subsequent Ottoman invasion of the Morea in 1460. After Thomas's death in 1465, the children moved to Rome, where they were initially taken care of by Cardinal Bessarion and were provided with money and housing by the Papacy. The money provided by the Papacy was gradually cut back and Manuel eventually left Rome in 1474 in order to seek his fortune by offering military service to various nobles and rulers in Europe, including Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan and Charles the Bold of Burgundy. Disappointed with the offers he received, and with the Papacy cutting the money back further, Manuel surprised the establishment in Rome by travelling to Constantinople in 1476 and throwing himself on the mercy of the Sultan Mehmed II, who had conquered the city 23 years earlier. The sultan generously received Manuel, who stayed in Constantinople for the rest of his life. The Ottomans called him \\"el Ghazi\\" (\\"holy warrior\\"). Though Manuel maintained his Christian faith, it is possible that he served in the Ottoman navy. He fathered two sons; John, who died young, and Andreas, who converted to Islam.  Biography  = Life in exile = Manuel was born on 2 January 1455Georgios Phrantzes Liber IV, 14, p. 385. as the second son of Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, and Catherine Zaccaria, the daughter of Centurione II Zaccaria, the last Prince of Achaea. After his uncle Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Byzantine emperor, died defending Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, on May 29, 1453, Manuel's family continued to live in the Morea as vassals of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. But constant bickering between Thomas, who tried to rally support to restore the Byzantine Empire, and his brother Demetrios, who sided with the Ottomans, led the Sultan to invade the Morea in 1460; Thomas, Catherine and their children escaped to the Venetian-held island of Corfu. Thomas then left his family to go to Rome, where he was welcomed and provided for by Pope Pius II. Thomas maintained hope that he would one day recover his lands and when preparations were made for a crusade (which ultimately never took place), Thomas personally rode around Italy to drum up support. Although Catherine Zaccaria died in August 1462 and Thomas summoned the children to Rome shortly thereafter, Manuel and his older brother Andreas did not choose rejoin their father until a few days before Thomas died in 1465. The two brothers, and their sister Zoe, travelled from Corfu to Rome in 1465 but arrived there after their father had already died. Manuel was 10 years old at the time and Andreas was 12. The children were put in the care of Cardinal Bessarion, who had fled the Byzantine Empire in 1439. Bessarion provided the education for the children and also arranged Zoe's marriage to Duke Ivan III of Moscow in June 1472. Manuel and Andreas continued to stay in Rome by consent of the Pope, who recognised Andreas as the heir of Thomas and the rightful Despot of the Morea. The money that had been provided to their father was reduced for the two brothers. Thomas had received 300 ducats a month from the Pope, with an additional 200 a month provided by the cardinals, but with his death, the cardinals stopped providing extra money and the 300 ducats were split between the two brothers, effectively reducing a pension of 500 to one of 150. Thomas's courtiers had complained that his pension had barely been enough to sustain his household and reducing it to this extent for his sons made their financial situations difficult. Andreas attempted to earn money by offering to sell his claims on the imperial title to various rulers in Europe, but as Manuel was second-in-line (as the younger brother), he had no claims to sell. Thus, the young prince left Rome in early 1474 to travel around Europe and seek his fortune, offering his services to various rulers and nobles. In November, Manuel was at Milan, where he offered Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza to enter Milanese service in some military capacity. The Duke appears to not have given Manuel a satisfactory offer and the following year he was instead at Vaud√©mont in Lorraine, offering similar services to Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy. Charles offered to employ Manuel for a monthly pay of 100 √©cus, but Manuel declined as the sum was too little to sustain his retinue. Soon thereafter, he returned to Rome. = Manuel in Constantinople = Upon his return to Rome, Manuel discovered that the meagre papal pension provided to him and Andreas had been halved to account for his absence. Despite his return to the city, the two brothers continued to only receive half of the previously agreed amount, getting only 150 ducats a month instead of 300. In despair of this financial situation, and knowing that he would not receive satisfactory offers in Western Europe, Manuel again left Rome in the spring of 1476 at the age of 21. Much to the surprise of everyone else involved, Manuel travelled to Constantinople and threw himself on the mercy of Mehmed II. Having been born after the city's fall, Manuel had never seen Constantinople before and would probably have been uncertain of the kind of reception he would receive. In contrast to his reception in Milan and Vaud√©mont, Mehmed generously received Manuel and provided him with an estate, income (a military salary of 100 aspers a day) and a pair of female concubines. The arrangement was similar to the one experienced by Manuel's uncle Demetrios Palaiologos in the Ottoman Empire a few years prior and Manuel lived happily in the city until the end of his life. As many other Greeks in the Ottoman Empire, Manuel remained a Christian until his death. In Constantinople he became known as \\"el Ghazi\\" (\\"holy warrior\\") and he might have served in the Ottoman navy. With his two concubines, or possibly a wife, Manuel fathered two sons; John Palaiologos, who died young, and Andreas Palaiologos, named after Manuel's brother, who converted to Islam. Manuel died at some point during the reign of Mehmed's son and successor, Bayezid II (1481‚Äì1512). Little is known of the further life of his son Andreas, who is last attested in 1519.Theodore Spandounes, De la origine deli Imperatori Ottomani, Sathas (1890) Tome IX (Paris), p. 175. English historian Steven Runciman writes that Andreas took the Muslim name Mehmet Pasha and served as a court official in Constantinople. Neither of Manuel's two sons are believed to have had children of their own. With their deaths, the descendants of the immediate relatives of the last few Byzantine emperors died out.''''''

There was a military conflict between Caliph Ali and Muawiya ibn Abu Sufyan (see Battle of Siffin); and to avoid the agonies of a further civil war, Hasan signed the Hasan‚ÄìMuawiya treaty with Muawiyah. According to the treaty, Hasan ceded the caliphate to Muawiyah but the latter could name no successor during his reign; instead, he was to let the Islamic world choose its successor afterward. Background Muawiyah was the governor of the Levant region of Arabia at the time (modern day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine). He had refused Ali's repeated demands for allegiance, when Ali was elected as the fourth Caliph, and was therefore in conflict with him. However, when Ali was assassinated and people gave allegiance to Hasan, Muawiyah prepared to attack Hasan. As a result there were repeated skirmishes between the armies of Hasan and Muawiyah with no conclusive outcome. Muawiyah who had already started negotiations with Hasan, sent high-level envoys, while committing himself in a witnessed letter to appoint Hasan his successor and give him whatever he wished. Hasan accepted the offer in principle and sent Amr ibn Salima al- Hamdani al-Arhabl and his own brother-in-law Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath back to Muawiyah as his negotiators, together with the envoys of the latter. Muawiyah then wrote a letter saying that he was making peace with Hasan on the basis that Hasan would inherit the reign after him. He swore that he would not seek to harm him; and that he would give him 1,000,000 dirhams from the treasury (Bayt al-mal) annually, along with the land tax of Fasa and Darabjird; to which Hasan was to send his own tax agents to collect it. The letter was witnessed by the four envoys and dated in August 661. When al-Hasan read the letter he commented: \\"He is trying to appeal to my greed for a matter which, if I desired it, I would not surrender to him.\\" Then he sent Abd Allah ibn al- Harith, whose mother Hind was Muawiyah's sister, to Muawiyah, instructing him: \\"Go to your uncle and tell him: If you grant safety to the people I shall pledge allegiance to you.\\" After which, Mu'awiyah gave him a blank paper with his seal at the bottom, inviting Hasan to write on it whatever he desired. The treaty According to Jafri, historians like Ya'qubi and Al-Masudi do not mention the terms of peace treaty at all. Other historians such as Dinawari, Ibn Abd al-Barr and Ibn al-Athir records different accounts of the conditions. And the timing of the blank sheet sent by Muawiyah to Hasan was confusing in Tabari's account. The most comprehensive account,which explains the different ambiguous accounts of other sources, according to Jafri, is given by Ahmad ibn A'tham, which must have taken it from al-Mada'ini. Madelung's view is close to that of Jafri when he stipulates that Hasan surrendered the reign over the Muslims to Muawiya on the basis that \\"he act in accordance with the Book of God, the Sunnah of His Prophet and the conduct of the righteous caliphs. Muawiyah should not be entitled to appoint his successor but that there should be an electoral council (Shura); the people would be safe, wherever they were, with respect to their person, their property and their offspring; Muawiyah would not seek any wrong against Hasan secretly or openly, and would not intimidate any of his companions.\\" The letter was testified by Abd Allah ibn al-Harith, and Amr ibn Salima and transmitted by them to Muawiyah for him to take recognition of its contents and to confirm his acceptance. Hasan, thus, surrendered his control of Iraq in Rabi II 41/August 661 after a reign of seven months. Narrations Narrated by Al-Hasan Al-Basri: writes: The main condition Hasan ibn Ali imposed on Muawiya for handing over power was to be just to the people and keep them safe and secure.The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate By Wilferd Madelung Page 232 Following is the extract of the treaty between Imam Hassan and Muawiya: # Authority will be handed to Muawiya provided that he should act according to the Book of Allah, the Sunna of the Prophet, and the behavior of the righteous Caliphs # Authority should be for Imam Hassan after Muawiya, and if an accident occurs, authority should go to Imam Hussain, Muawiya has no right to entrust authority to anyone # Muawiya should abandon cursing the Commander of the faithful (Imam Ali) and the practice of using the qunut in the salat against him, Muawiya should also not mention Imam Ali unless in a good manner. # He (Muawiya) should exclude what is in the treasury of Kufa, that is five million (dirhams). So handing over authority does not include it (i.e., this sum of money). Muawiya should send al-Husayn one million dirhams a year, he should prefer the children of Hashim (banu Hashim) in giving and gifts to the banu Abd Shams, and should divide one million (dirhams) among the sons of those who were killed with the Commander of the faithful at the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffin, and should spend that from the taxes of Dar Abjard. # The people should be safe wherever they are in the earth of Allah. Muawiya should give security to all races. The companions of Imam Ali should be given security wherever they are. Muawiya should not seek a calamity secretly or openly for Imam Hassan, nor for Imam Hussein, nor for any of the Prophet‚Äôs Ahlul Bayt. After the peace treaty, Hasan received Mu'awiya's letter asking him to counter the khariji threat.

On September 1, 1941, they merged with the Tokyo Rapid Railway to form the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA). The next development was the opening of Edobashi Station on February 28, 1963, when Toei Line 1 was extended to Higashi-Ginza.

Much of the play's dialogue is retained, though discussion of off-stage characters is usually replaced with their appearance, and a more conventionally cinematic level and speed of dialogue is maintained. Also, the younger daughter Hannah is omitted. Plot A couple move to Sydney from Melbourne, and soon become lured by the bright lights of the big city. Colin, the scriptwriter husband, is corrupted by his editor and then falls for his wife, while Colin's wife Kate begins to lose sight of her ideals in a new world of hustlers and cynics. Cast * John Hargreaves as Colin * Robyn Nevin as Kate * Chris Haywood as Mike * Nicole Kidman as Helen * Ruth Cracknell as Elaine * Dennis Miller as Malcolm * Ella Scott as Penny * Haydon Samuels as Sam * Nicholas Hammond as Ian * Michelle Torres as Kath Production The film rights to the play were bought by Joan Long, whose first choice to direct was Bruce Beresford. However, he had just filmed an adaptation of the play Crimes of the Heart and did not want to do another play adaptation, so Michael Jenkins was hired instead. According to some accounts, the original draft of the script pared down the dialogue but John Hargreaves and Robyn Nevin insisted it be put back during rehearsals. Michael Jenkins decided to go along with the actors but had them speak the dialogue especially fast. Jenkins: > We sat down with the piece when it was in script form and we thought, 'This > is not going to survive if we approach it too politely', so... we decided we > would do it as we did ‚Äì we were a bit inspired by some of the Cary Grant > movies of the '40s when they talked so quickly. So we thought we would > pursue that line and feed the information to an audience at a fairly fast > rate so that it keeps happening for them. There were mixed critiques. We had > some friends and some foes. Those that loved it loved it - those that hated > it were very angry about how fast we spoke.Interview with Mike Jenkins, 25 > March 1996 accessed 19 October 2012 Possible inspirations Williamson and Denis Whitburn worked on a World War II miniseries with director Chris Thomson titled The Last Bastion, which ran on Network Ten. The running time was 360 minutes. (Academy Home Entertainment released a version that ran only 160 minutes to US home video). The miniseries was much ballyhooed but was not well rated. Also, Williamson assisted his brother-in-law, Chris L√∂fv√©n, on Oz, an Australian rock musical film that retold The Wizard of Oz on the streets of Melbourne. The fictional Land of Oz rarely comes up in Australian conversation; the term is used almost exclusively as the nickname for one's own country. The title of the play Emerald City has been used as a frequent moniker and nickname for the city of Sydney ever since the play was first presented. The title has been attributed to Brett Sheehy who was Sydney Theatre Company's Literary Manager when the play was written and first produced. The play's director Richard Wherrett recalls in his autobiography The Floor of Heaven: My Life in Theatre that Sheehy suggested Emerald City as the title, which Williamson accepted, adding the line of dialogue, \\"The Emerald City of Oz. Everyone comes here along their yellow brick roads looking for the answers to their problems and all they find are the demons within themselves.\\" Reception The Australian Film Institute nominated the film for five awards: Best Actor (John Hargreaves), Best Achievement in Cinematography (Paul Murphy), Best Adapted Screenplay (David Williamson), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Nicole Kidman), and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Chris Haywood), for which it won. Williamson enjoyed the adaptation saying it \\"had a lot of raw energy\\".Greg Gallaghan, \\"10 questions - David Williamson\\", The Australian 18 December 2010 accessed 5 April 2014 Home media The film has never been released on home video in the United States, though it has been shown on the cable channel Romance Classics.

It was founded in 1917 as the Socialist Workers' Party (, PSO) by Manabendra Nath Roy, a left-wing Indian revolutionary. The PSO changed its name to the Mexican Communist Party in November 1919, following the October Revolution in Russia. It was outlawed in 1925 and remained illegal until 1935, during the presidency of the leftist L√°zaro C√°rdenas. The PCM saw in the left wing of the nationalist regime that emerged from the Mexican Revolution a progressive force to be supported‚Äîi.e. C√°rdenas and his allies. In the end, the PCM disappeared after helping form the Party of the Democratic Revolution, a split from the PRI led by the son of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas. The PCM later lost its registration in 1946 because it did not meet the new requirements of at least 30,000 registered members in at least 21 of Mexico's 31 states and the Federal District. It is not clear whether the party was unable to recruit enough members or whether, fearing repression, it refused to turn membership rolls over to the Secretary of the Interior, then in charge of elections. Over the next 30 years, the party had some minor influence in the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) and among the intelligentsia of Mexico City. In the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 50,000 (0.28% of the working-age population of the country).Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. Communism and Economic Development, in The American Political Science Review, Vol. 62, No. 1. (March 1968), p. 122. In 1976 the party nominated Valent√≠n Campa as its presidential candidate, competing (unofficially) against Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo. Following the electoral reform of 1977 that lowered the barrier for parties to get on the ballot, the PCM regained temporary registration for the 1979 mid-term elections. After its poor showing and a two decade-long period of moderation during which it adopted a \\"Eurocommunist\\" position, the PCM merged with three other far-left political parties in November 1981 and became the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico (PSUM). Most members of the PSUM then merged with somewhat more moderate left-wing groups to form the Mexican Socialist Party (PMS) in 1987. The PMS never competed in national elections alone, having joined the National Democratic Front (FDN)‚Äîa split from the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI)‚Äîto support the presidential bid of Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas in 1988. What was the PMS was then absorbed into the newly formed Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in 1989.

This is caused by the mixture exceeding the upper explosive limit for the particular fuel. An engine in this condition will not start until the excessively rich mixture has been cleared. It is also possible for an engine to stall from a running state due to this condition. Engine flooding was a common problem with carbureted cars, but newer fuel-injected ones are immune to the problem when operating within normal tolerances. Flooding usually occurs during starting, especially under cold conditions or because the accelerator has been pumped. It can also occur during hot starting; high temperatures may cause fuel in the carburetor float chamber to evaporate into the inlet manifold, causing the air/fuel mixture to exceed the upper explosive limit. High temperature fuel may also result in a vapor lock, which is unrelated to flooding but has a similar symptom. A severe form of engine flooding occurs when excessive liquid fuel enters the combustion chamber. This reduces the dead volume of the combustion chamber and thus places a heavy load on the starter motor, such that it fails to turn the engine. Damage (due to excessive compression and even dilution of the lubricating oil with fuel) can also occur. This condition is known as the engine \\"flooding out.\\" Possible causes of too much liquid fuel in the engine include a defective carburetor float that is not closing the fuel inlet needle valve, or debris caught in the needle valve preventing it from sealing. Liquids inside an internal combustion engine are extremely detrimental because of the incompressibility of liquids. Although not the most common cause, a severely flooded engine could result in a hydrolock. A hydrolock occurs when a liquid fills a combustion chamber to the point that it is impossible to turn the crankshaft without a catastrophic failure of the engine or one of its vital components. The conventional remedy for a flooded carbureted engine is to steadily hold the throttle full open (full power position) while continuing to crank the engine. This permits the maximum flow of air through the engine, flushing the overly rich fuel mixture out of the exhaust. If the exhaust system is hot enough to autoignite, an after-fire may result; this can be seen as a flame discharging through the exhaust system. On a fuel-injected engine, ignoring the throttle (no fuel) while starting permits electronic logic systems to produce the correct fuel mixture, often based on exhaust gases. Some fuel injection computers interpret \\"pumping\\" the throttle to indicate a flooded engine, and alter the fuel-air mixture accordingly. In a carbureted engine equipped with an accelerator pump (which advances fuel flow to match air ingestion under rapid throttle acceleration), \\"pumping\\" the throttle will force excess fuel into the engine, further flooding it. In worst cases, the excess fuel can foul spark plugs, sometimes necessitating their cleaning or replacement before the engine will start. This is most likely to occur on a carbureted engine in cold weather, after a running engine has been shut off briefly before being restarted. Doing so can cause the choke valve to configure the mixture for a cold engine start, despite higher actual temperatures, resulting in an overly rich mixture and flooded engine.

Multiple press reports claim that at his peak weight, he weighed 50 stone (around 700 lbs or 320 kg).Why 50-stone Barry seized a chance of life , The Observer, September 18, 2005 Austin's appearances in the press and on television are usually related to current concerns about an alarming increase in obesity among the population. He has thus been asked to comment on news and current affairs strands such as the BBC's Breakfast News. Austin has also been the star of a Sky One documentary, Inside Britain's Fattest Man, presented by fellow Silhillian Richard Hammond in the manner of the science fiction film Fantastic Voyage. According to the programme, Austin typically consumed in excess of 29,000 calories a day ‚Äì over ten times the average daily intake for a UK male, and has major health problems as a result of his morbid obesity. He also claimed to drink up to 40 pints on a night out. A previous documentary on Britain's heaviest men ‚Äì The Fattest Men in Britain ‚Äì which saw Austin take the crown, though he was notably lighter and more mobile at the time, reported that he led an actively social life and was something of a celebrity on the Birmingham club circuit, and a very visible supporter of Birmingham City F.C. at their home games. However, he was unable to attend their victorious Wembley Stadium appearance on 27 February 2011, when they lifted the Football League Cup with a 2‚Äì1 win over Arsenal in the final as he was too big to get a seat. By this stage he weighed 40 stone. According to both documentaries, Austin's greatest problem is his legs (which have notably reduced his mobility in the latter programme). Starved of blood because of their enormous size and distance from his heart, they cause him to suffer regular terrible bacterial infections that leave him swollen, in agony and immobile at home. In September 2005, Austin committed himself to losing weight, restricting his daily intake to a mere 1,500 calories in a bid to save his life. In November 2009 it was reported that Austin currently weighed 40 stone and was starting a new diet plan to try to lose at least 10 stone. The report also gave his peak weight as 65 stone.40st Birmingham City fan Barry Austin is copying diet used by Friends star Jennifer Aniston diet, Sunday Mercury, November 15, 2009 In December 2009 Austin played 'Big Brian' in ITV1's comedy-drama The Fattest Man in Britain starring Timothy Spall and Bobby Ball.The Fattest Man In Britain on The British Comedy Guide website In February 2012 it was confirmed that Barry was to marry his partner of 13 years and former Britain‚Äôs fattest woman contestant, \\"Big Debs\\" Debbie Kirby.

The freeway bears the symbol and forms part of Metroad 5. There is one interchange, at Indooroopilly onto Moggill Road. A bicycle path runs the length of the freeway, allowing commuting to Toowong and onto Brisbane by bicycle. Options are currently being investigated in to a possible Kenmore Bypass. This would connect with the M5 along the existing preserved corridor to Chuwar, Queensland. This preserved corridor was identified in the 1960s for a future freeway. History The Western Freeway was constructed in two stages. The first stretched from Milton Road at Toowong south to Taringa Parade at Taringa, and was opened to traffic on 31 August 1970. Construction of the second stage (Taringa Parade to Moggill Road) commenced in 1975 and was opened on 24 May 1979. Later construction began on a direct link to the Centenary Highway, and this extension was opened to traffic on 19 December 1984. Work began in 1985 on the duplication of the freeway as part of the larger Mount Cootha Road to Calmont Street project, which also involved the duplication of Centenary Bridge. The works were completed and commissioned by Russ Hinze on 27 March 1987.Centenary Bridge plaque (JPG image) In 2008‚Äì2009, the Toowong Bicycle and Pedestrian Overpass was constructed across the Toowong end of the freeway to connect the Western Freeway Cycleway (which runs parallel and east of the freeway) to Mt Coot-tha Road. The fifteen span composite bridge cost $5.4 million. Work began in April 2011 on the Legacy Way, a tunnel to link the Toowong end of the Western Freeway with the Inner City Bypass at Kelvin Grove to reduce travel time between the Centenary Bridge and the Inner City Bypass by 70%. In February 2014, work began on widening of Western Freeway (executed as part of Legacy Way tunnel project). The existing four lanes of freeway between western approach ramp of Legacy Way and Moggill Road interchange were upgraded to six lanes. The upgrade was intended to improve traffic flow on the freeway between Moggill Road and Legacy Way tunnel. As a result of a citizens e-petition, on 9 October 2019, the overpass across the Western Freeway adjacent to the Toowong Cemetery (formerly known as the Toowong Bicycle and Pedestrian Overpass) was renamed the Canon Garland Overpass in honour of David Garland who pioneered Anzac Day ceremonies at the cemetery. The renaming occurred on the 80th anniversary of Garland's death. Exits and interchanges The entire freeway is in the City of Brisbane local government area.

Disney Sing-Along Songs is a series of videos on VHS, betamaxs, laserdiscs and DVDs with musical moments from various Disney films, TV shows and attractions. Lyrics for the songs are displayed on-screen with the Mickey Mouse icon as a \\"bouncing ball\\". Early releases open with a theme song introduction (written by Patrick DeRemer) containing footage featuring Professor Owl and his class, seen originally in 1953 in two Disney shorts, Melody and Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom (voiced then by Bill Thompson). Professor Owl (now voiced by Corey Burton) hosts some of the videos, while either Ludwig Von Drake or Jiminy Cricket host others, and later volumes, as well as the two Christmas videos, did not have a host at all. The footage of Von Drake and Jiminy Cricket were taken from several television programs (including the Walt Disney anthology television series, and Mickey Mouse Club) featuring the characters in the 1950s and 1960s. History Issued beginning on December 23, 1986, there have been four distinct series. The 1st launched in 1986 with Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah, followed by five more volumes. The 2nd series began appearing in August 1990 with Under the Sea and Disneyland Fun, featuring a new design and reissued volumes labeled One (1) through Twelve (12) in North America (worldwide, volume numbers). The 3rd series, beginning in 1994 with Circle of Life, saw another new package design and the re-release of all previous volumes (excluding Fun with Music, repackaged as 101 Notes of Fun along with Hercules for the non-North American market). Around 1996 this series incorporated Mickey's Fun Songs repackaged as Sing-Along Songs (a three volume live-action set in the style of Disneyland Fun). Spanish language editions of some volumes were released (Disney Canta Con Nosotros). Some songs moved to newer volumes, newly remixed opening and closing songs appeared, and the final release in this format was Flik's Musical Adventure at Disney's Animal Kingdom on June 8, 1999. During the remixed opening and closing themes, the remixed opening was heard on Friend Like Me, Circle of Life, Honor to Us All, and Collection of All-Time Favorites, and the remixed closing was heard on the 1993 and 1994 editions of Heigh-Ho, as well as Friend Like Me, Circle of Life, and Collection of All-Time Favorites. This series abandoned any new volume numbers, included only sporadically on third series volumes. A special three volume set, Collection of All-Time Favorites, was released in 1997. There have been over 30 titles released to home video. Newly remastered editions began appearing in 2002 on Disney DVD, beginning with Very Merry Christmas Songs, featuring a new package design, bonus features, and some new songs. Some Disney DVD feature releases include individual songs as bonus features. Winnie-the-Pooh Sing a Song volumes are being incorporated into the Sing Along Songs series. The DVD series (4th series) features Sebastian the Crab (from The Little Mermaid) singing the theme song, replacing Professor Owl.

It is directly across the Red River from Selkirk, Manitoba. The village of East Selkirk is connected to Winnipeg, about away, via Highway 59 or Provincial Road 204  History  The Town of East Selkirk was incorporated in 1883 and its first reeve was Francis Hay. East Selkirk saw a huge immigration boom in the latter part of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century. The Round House, a large building made of Tyndall limestone, was situated next to the railway tracks and not only served as an immigration hall but also as the church, school and hospital. Many immigrants from Poland, Ukraine and other eastern-European countries passed through its doors and onward to their homesteads throughout the Interlake, but some remained to settle in the local area. A photograph of a sign providing information about the Van Horne Farm and its place in the history of East Selkirk East Selkirk was also home to the St. Peter's Reservation. It was here that Chief Peguis led his Saulteaux tribe in the early 19th century. Beginning in the late 1890s, the village of East Selkirk, as well as the town of Selkirk, Manitoba, Rural Municipality of St. Clements and St. Andrew's, Manitoba slowly began incorporating the lands of the Reservation and taxing the British-European occupants who held patents to river lots. This began a dispute that ultimately led the Federal Department of Indian Affairs to force the Saulteaux people out to clear way for the British- European settlers. Federal Agents came to the Reserve, bribed the Chief and Band Council, got them drunk and gave the entire tribe only one day to decide on the surrender agreement. In 1907, the surrender took place and the Saulteaux were moved to a remote corner of Lake Winnipeg to join the Peguis Reserve. This surrender was, and still is, considered illegal. Peguis First Nation finalized a land claim in 2008 that originated from this incident. A bridge connecting the two communities was planned for construction in 1931, but the Depression delayed the project. In the fall of 1936 the bridge connecting the village of East Selkirk to the City of Selkirk was opened. At the time it cost more than C$300,000 to build. Selkirk Bridge connecting the City of Selkirk with Village of East Selkirk The Town of East Selkirk was dissolved in 1904 and the community absorbed by the neighboring RM of St. Clements. The RM celebrated its centennial anniversary in 1884.  Amenities  The village is home to an elementary school, Happy Thought School and a junior high, East Selkirk Middle School. The mascot of Happy Thought School is a husky and the mascot of East Selkirk Middle School is a hawk. The village is also home to the East Selkirk Recreation Association, a post office, gas station, and also two churches: St. Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church and the Blessed Virgin Mary Ukrainian Catholic Church. The Central Manitoba Railway (CEMR), owned by Cando Rail Services Ltd. of Brandon, operates a short line between East Selkirk and Carman, In 2018 they were given C$5.6 million to improve rail service between the two communities.  Water  In the early 2000s, concerns about drinking water quality from existing underground aquifers in the East Selkirk area led to the village issuing boil water advisories. As the Water Treatment Plant and distribution pipes were upgraded, the boil water advisory was lifted in January 2016. Source water serving the R.M. of St. Clements comes from a deep underground carbonate aquifer in operation since 2012. Two water pumps bring in water at the rate of 13 l/sec. A Water Treatment Plant is located within the village of East Selkirk at 1043 Kittson Rd. The underground Reservoir can store 600 m3 at a time. Eleven point eight kilometres of water distribution pipe serve 275 households. A further C$1 million upgrade of the Water Treatment Plant in late 2017 meant that residents would not have to soften their water at their homes. A 2017 study on the condition of the 30-year old Lockport Wastewater Treatment Plant indicated the best solution would be to connect Lockport to the East Selkirk Wastewater Treatment Plant via pipes along Henderson Hwy. between the two communities. This would allow for an additional 850 homes that could handle outflow from the East Selkirk Sewage Lagoon.

The mission of CNPS is to conserve California native plants and their natural habitats, and increase understanding, appreciation, and horticultural use of native plants throughout the entire state and California Floristic Province. History California Native Plant Society was founded in 1965 by professional botanists and grassroots activists who, after saving an important native plant garden in Berkeley's Tilden Regional Park, were inspired to create an ongoing organization with the mission to save and promote the native plants of California. Structure For 50 years, professional CNPS staff and volunteers have worked alongside scientists, government officials, and regional planners to protect habitats and species, and to advocate for well- informed environmental practices, regulations, and policies. The organization works at the local level through the various regional chapters, and at the state level through its five major programs, board of directors, Chapter Council, and state office. CNPS continues to be a grassroots organization, with nearly 10,000 members and volunteers in 35 chapters covering the state of California and northwest Baja California. Chapter volunteers promote CNPS‚Äôs mission to conserve California‚Äôs native plants and their natural habitats, and to increase the horticultural uses of native plants at the local level. Membership is open to everyone, and chapter activities ranging from field trips, restoration activities, meetings, symposia, public garden maintenance, plant sales, and more are open to the public. At the state organizational level, CNPS has five core programs in Conservation, Rare Plant Science, Vegetation Science, Education, and Horticulture. Each program has dedicated CNPS staff supported by volunteer committees consisting of experienced botanical experts, conservation advocates, professionals, educators, and community activists. Activities Chapters of CNPS organize many events of local significance. In keeping with the public outreach and education mission of the society, these events are generally free and open to the public. * Wildflower shows * Native garden tours * Native plant sales in spring and fall * General public program meetings * Lectures, talks, and workshops * Public demonstration gardens * Local restoration projects * Field trips * Local publications CNPS maintains the online Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants, or Inventory, which catalogs the California Rare Plant Ranks (known as \\"CNPS Lists\\" prior to 2010). The Inventory and its ranking system remain the most widely adopted source of information about California‚Äôs special rare plants today and is used on a daily basis by scientists, land planners, and agency officials. CNPS also created A Manual of California Vegetation publication and online database, the standard vegetation reference now relied upon by state and federal agencies. Both of these resources are recognized as the most advanced available for identifying and managing critical habitat in California. A popular project in collaboration between the Education and Rare Plant Programs is the \\"Rare Plant Treasure Hunt\\", or RPTH. In the first five years of the RPTH project, between the 2010-2014 seasons, volunteers and staff successfully updated over 2,500 occurrences of rare, threatened, and endangered species to both the California Rare Plant Ranks and California Department of Fish and Wildlife's California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB). Over 1,000 of these recorded occurrences were new to science. A new offshoot of the RPTH is the California Rare Plant Seed Rescue Project, in which volunteers will collect seeds and tissue from every population of rare plants in California, and seed bank them in long-term storage facilities to protect them against future extinction. In 2010, the California Native Plant Society was successful in having the state legislature designate the third week in April each year as \\"California Native Plant Week\\". The legislature recognized that \\"California native plants, being perfectly suited to California's climate and soil, require far fewer fertilizers, soil amendments, or pesticides, and use 60 to 90 percent less water than conventional landscapes\\". The California Native Plant Society also organizes a triennial conservation conference every three years which hosts over 1000 attendees from across California and beyond, and an annual conservation symposium every September. =Publications= Besides books, bulletins, and posters, the society publishes the academic journal Fremontia, devoted to botany, horticulture, vegetation science, land management, CNPS projects, and related native plant topics, three times a year, and the CNPS Bulletin, a quarterly newsletter.

She was born and raised in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. She co-founded the pioneering LGBT website PlanetOut.com, and campaigned to have a barrier erected on the Golden Gate Bridge to prevent suicides. Biography Olson was educated at the University of Minnesota. In 1986, while still a student, Olson co-founded the Minneapolis/St.Paul Lesbian, Gay, Bi & Transgender Film Festival, initially under the name Lavender Images. Olson was inspired in this move by Vito Russo's book, The Celluloid Closet. In 1992 Olson was hired by the company Frameline and moved to San Francisco to work as guest curator on the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, before being appointed co-director alongside Mark Finch. After three years Olson left this position to co-found the website PlanetOut.com. Olson worked as director of entertainment and e-commerce for the site, as well fulfilling the same roles for Gay.com. She created the PopcornQ section of the PlanetOut.com website, basing the section on her book The Ultimate Guide to Lesbian & Gay Film and Video. In 1997 Olson attended the Sundance Festival and arranged, along with Outfest executive director Morgan Rumpf, a small brunch aimed at fellow queer attendees. The event has happened annually since then being co-presented by PlanetOut.com and Outfest until 2005. Since the demise of PlanetOut, it is now presented solely by Outfest. The sponsors described it in 2005 as \\"the premiere gay and lesbian industry event during Sundance\\". By March 2005, Olson was named Director of E-Commerce & Consumer Marketing for Wolfe Video/Wolfe Releasing. Works Olson initially compiled trailers into documentary features, showing Homo Promo, her compilation of vintage gay movie trailers at the Amsterdam Gay & Lesbian Film Festival in 1991, and her work in this area has been recognised as instructional in teaching students contextualisation. She continued compiling trailers throughout the 1990s, with her last such compilation released being Bride of Trailer Camp, released in 2001 (others in the series include: \\"Trailer Camp\\", \\"Neo Homo Promo\\", \\"Afro Promo\\", \\"Trailers Schmailers\\"). During this period Olson also wrote Ultimate Guide to Lesbian & Gay Film and Video (1996). The book was based on Olson's BA thesis. Her next book was The Queer Movie Poster Book (Chronicle Books, 2005). This book was suggested in 1991 by Stuart Marshall, who recommended Olson pitch the idea to London's Gay Men's Press. Although the book was turned down by both them and Serpent's Tail, to whom the idea was pitched as a follow up to her previous book, Olson was eventually commissioned to write the book in 2002 (published in 2005, it went on to be a Lambda Literary Awards nominee). Olson based the work in part on her own collection of such material, which she has subsequently donated to San Francisco‚Äôs GLBT Historical Society. Her collection was exhibited at the San Francisco Public Library in 2004, with Olson delivering an accompanying lecture. In 2005 Olson released The Joy of Life, her debut feature, which won Best Outstanding Artistic Achievement at the 2005 Outfest and at the 2005 Newfest received Best U.S. Narrative Screenplay, and has been favorably reviewed in a number of publications. It garnered Olson the Marlon Riggs Award by the San Francisco Film Critics Circle in 2005. Working on the film led Olson to pen an open letter to the San Francisco Chronicle on the matter of the Golden Gate Bridge's position as the top suicide landmark in the world. Her former colleague, Mark Finch, had jumped from the bridge on January 14, 1995, and Olson used this event to inform her own film. Her letter was published on the tenth anniversary of Finch's death and supported the Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California's launching of a campaign for a barrier to be installed on the bridge. Olson also distributed her film to the bridge's board of directors, noting \\"several of the bridge directors told me they appreciated seeing the film and found it illuminating\\", and in March 2005 the board voted to explore the installation of a barrier to prevent jumping. Olson's 2009 short film, 575 Castro St. was shot on the empty Castro Camera store set of the Academy Award winning drama Milk. 575 Castro St. premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and has circulated to film festivals around the world as well as being showcased on the FilmInFocus.com website as part of the theatrical release of Milk and at the Human Rights Campaign Store (the former Castro Camera) in a looping presentation on view during regular store hours. In 2015 Olson's film, The Royal Road premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. The film won the award for Best LGBTQ Film at the 2015 Ann Arbor Film Festival as well as the Avant Garde & Genre Special Jury Mention from BAFICI, the Buenos Aires International Independent Cinema Festival.

Forgottonia (), also spelled Forgotonia, is the name given to a 16-county region in Western Illinois in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This geographic region forms the distinctive western bulge of Illinois (area west of 90¬∞ Longitude West) that is roughly equivalent to \\"The Tract\\", the Illinois portion of the Military Tract of 1812, along and west of the Fourth Principal Meridian (see Principal meridian). Since this wedge- shaped region lies between the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, it has historically been isolated (river bridge access) from the eastern portion of Central Illinois. The name Forgottonia was created by Jack Horn, son of civically minded Coca-Cola regional bottler Frank \\"Pappy\\" Horn; John Armstrong, Macomb Chamber of Commerce Board Member; and Neil Gamm, a Western Illinois University theatre student and a graduate of VIT (Vermont-Ipava-Table Grove) High School. The initiative grew from frustration among the citizens and public officials of western Illinois due to the lack of support for regional transportation and infrastructure projects. Federal funding for a highway from Chicago to Kansas City routed through the heart of western Illinois was defeated by the U.S. Congress (1955, 1968, 1972), passenger rail service from Quincy and Macomb to Chicago was dropped in 1970. Carthage College packed up and moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1964. The term ‚Äò‚ÄôForgottonia‚Äô‚Äô was used again in 1980s by Congressman Dick Durbin, who represented the southern portion of the region, in stump speeches as he ran as a Democrat for the U.S. House of Representatives seat held by Paul Findley of Pittsfield for 22 years. He expanded the definition to include communications (educational television, fiber-optic routes, etc.) and infrastructure services (private and public). While the region's name is less popular today, the exodus of population and industries has continued. Some counties in this region have reached federal poverty levels, for the first time in the state's history. In the 1970s, there were six Illinois River highway bridge crossings south of Peoria (Pekin, Havana, Beardstown, Meredosia, Florence, and Hardin), plus two free Illinois River ferries at Kampsville, and Brussels. The Valley City Eagle bridge for the Central Illinois Expressway in the southern section of the region was not completed until the late 1980s. There were issues with eagles nesting in the Ray Norbut State Fish and Wildlife Area, through which the highway passes. The Mississippi River highways bridges at that time were toll bridges with a few exceptions, and owned by railroads or cities along the river. The toll ferry across the Mississippi River at Canton, Missouri served Adams County, Illinois; it was closed in 2014. Origin, coining of the name Forgottonia represented a protest against inequalities in state and federal funding of infrastructure (e.g. transportation), communications and economic development in the region after World War II. In 1955, during the formation of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, the Chicago to Kansas City interstate route through the heart of this region was eliminated due to objections from Iowa and St. Louis as well as various granger railroads serving this region. In 1956, Missouri selected St. Louis based corridors to Joplin (US 66), Will Rogers Turnpike and Kansas City (US 40), Kansas Turnpike. A northern Missouri corridor (US 36) was viewed as a St. Louis by-pass and not supported. Carthage College, in Hancock County, relocated its educational campus to Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1964.Carthage College history Federal highway bills throughout the 1960s that included funding for a Chicago‚ÄìKansas City Expressway were defeated and removed from the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. which added 1500 miles (2400 km) to the Interstate system (Interstate 15E in southern CA and Interstate 27 in northwest Texas). George H. Mahon, Texas member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1935 to 1979 and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee after 1964, helped secure funding for the Interstate 27 route. The reintroduction of the Chicago to Kansas City Expressway was again defeated in the US Congress in 1972. These political and congressional actions resulted in the exodus of the region's businesses, long-time industries, and population by 1970. Those significant events were the catalysts for more vocal public protests by residents. Interstate Highway Plan, October 1970. Note 1968 additions. Variously described as a new U.S. state or an independent republic, Forgottonia eventually became a fictional political secession movement in the early 1970s conceived by residents of McDonough County, in the heart of this region. Western Illinois University student Neil Gamm was named governor, and the hamlet of Fandon near Colchester was to be Forgottonia's capital. The name would catch on because the region appeared to be \\"forgotten\\" by politicians and business developers. Due to the loss of train service in 1971, with the creation of Amtrak, the State of Illinois intervened at the request of the region's residents, Quincy University, Western Illinois University and public officials. This became part of the 1971 \\"Illinois Service\\" initiative and is partially funded by the Illinois Department of Transportation. =Forgottonia counties= These are the 16 counties from Neal Gamm's original list. These Illinois county governments joined the movement in 1972. {  *Adams *Brown  *Calhoun *Cass  *Fulton *Greene  *Hancock *Henderson  *Knox *McDonough  *Mercer *Morgan  *Pike *Schuyler  *Scott *Warren } The unincorporated village of Bernadotte, in Fulton County, which is four miles north of Ipava on the Spoon River, has the distinction of having once been considered as the site for the capital of Illinois, prior to the capital being located at Vandalia in 1820. Vandalia was selected over Bernadotte by the difference of one vote. The 2010 US Census population of Forgottonia (16 counties) is 354,709 residents.https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/profile/IL Illinois 2010 Census profile, by county http://www2.illinois.gov/census/Pages/Census2010Data.aspx Illinois 2010 Census Data Transportation projects and proposals since 1972 =Avenue of the Saints (1956, 1991‚àí2010)= Logo of the Avenue of the Saints An Avenue of the Saints (St. Paul, Minnesota to St. Louis, Missouri) Expressway was proposed in 1955 during the formation of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. That route would have followed U.S. Route 61 from St. Paul through La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Dubuque, Iowa, to Davenport, Iowa, and then following U.S. Route 67 from Davenport through western Illinois crossing the new Clark Bridge at Alton to St. Louis. This routing would have been along U.S. Route 67, the major north‚Äìsouth arterial highway in the Western Illinois region. The Mississippi River barge companies raised political objections for a new federally funded competitor. This route was not selected in 1956. In the 1980s, this north‚Äìsouth arterial highway for an Avenue of the Saints was revived by Mt. Pleasant, Iowa elected officials, led by Ernie Hayes, owner of a local insurance agency, with support from the state of Missouri, led by Dick Gephardt, House majority leader in 1989. Future Iowa governor and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack, mayor of Mt. Pleasant from 1987 to 1992, was a strong supporter. This highway proposal was included as Corridor 2 in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102‚Äì240; ISTEA, pronounced \\"Ice-Tea\\") as a high priority North- South NAFTA corridor. By the end of 1989, four possible routes for the Avenue of the Saints were under consideration by the Federal Highway Administration. Two of the rejected routes would have followed U.S. Route 52 and U.S. Route 63 from St. Paul through Rochester, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa. The other route rejected was the 1955 proposed route following U.S. Route 67 through the heart of the Forgottonia region. In 1990, the FHWA chose its route for the Avenue of the Saints: The Expressway would follow Interstate 35 from St. Paul to a point south of Clear Lake, Iowa; U.S. Route 18 to Charles City, Iowa; U.S. Route 218 to Cedar Falls, Iowa; Iowa Highway 58 and U.S. Route 20 around Cedar Falls and Waterloo, Iowa; Interstate 380 from Waterloo through Cedar Rapids to Interstate 80 near Coralville, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; U.S. 218 to Donnellson, Iowa; Iowa Highway 394 and Route B to Wayland, Missouri; and following U.S. 61 and Interstate 64 from Wayland through Missouri, west of the Mississippi River, to St. Louis. The route exclusively serves Iowa and Missouri, using existing interstates in Minnesota and St. Louis area for routing to terminus \\"Saint\\" cities. This routing provides Quincy, IL with access to the Avenue of the Saints via a 10-mile segment of U.S. Route 24 from Taylor, Missouri. =Amtrak service and expansion (1971‚àípresent)= Amtrak's logo 1971-2000 Denied access to the US Interstate highway network, the \\"Illinois Service\\" initiative for Amtrak rail service was approved in 1971. It is partially funded by the Illinois Department of Transportation. The Illinois Zephyr began daily round-trip service from Chicago to Quincy in 1971, through the heart of the region. Amtrak's Southwest Chief and California Zephyr share trackage with the Illinois Zephyr as far as Galesburg. The state of Missouri's \\"Missouri Service\\" only funded the extension of the Ann Rutledge to provide daily service between Kansas City and St. Louis with continuing services to Chicago via Springfield. The Illinois Zephyr has become one of Amtrak's most successful routes, and is the longest continuously-operated state-supported route in the Amtrak network. As part of the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative and Illinois's partnership with Amtrak an additional daily train service on this Chicago-Quincy line was added on October 30, 2006. This service expansion is part of the state sponsorship for increasing round-trip train service between Chicago and downstate cities from three daily to seven daily schedules. The new Carl Sandburg train joined the existing Illinois Zephyr to provide both a morning and evening train in each direction. Proposals have been considered to extend the two routes across the Mississippi River to Hannibal and/or St. Louis. In February 2009, Thomas C. Carper, mayor of Macomb from 1991 to 2003, was elected as Chairman of Amtrak's Board of Directors for a 4-year term, until February 2013. Mr. Carper rejoined the Amtrak Board of Directors on August 15, 2013 for a five-year term. During fiscal year 2011, both the Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg carried a combined 225,000 passengers, a 6.9% increase over FY2010. The two trains had a total revenue of $5,580,227 in FY2011, a 10.6% increase over FY2010. =Central Illinois Expressway / Interstate 72 (1978‚àí2010)= The Central Illinois Expressway, the Interstate 72 (I-72) Purple Heart Memorial Highway began in the late 1970s and was completed in 1991. The Interstate 172 spur for Quincy access to the Expressway was completed in 1995. This provided some relief for the southern counties and enabled Interstate access to the cities of Quincy, Pittsfield and Jacksonville from Springfield, Central Illinois and Indiana. Two decades later, the Missouri Department of Transportation, as part of NAFTA High Priority Corridor 61 - Missouri corridors, completed their Interstate 72 and U.S. Route 36 Northern Missouri segment from Hannibal, MO through Cameron to St. Joseph, MO in August 2010. In coordination with Illinois DOT, the route from Cameron, MO to Hannibal, MO is marked as Chicago-Kansas City - Missouri Route 110. =Chicago-Kansas City Tollway (1989 studies)= In 1989, the idea of a Chicago to Kansas City expressway was revisited. A tri-state economic and highway study was performed and found that a full, limited-access tollway running from the Kansas Turnpike at Kansas City to the Indiana Toll Road at Gary or Tri-State Tollway near the Joliet area would cost $2 to $2.5 billion, if funded entirely by private investors. The study was useful in providing an expenditure number (1989 dollars) to Illinois and Missouri legislatures and public officials for building the highway. Missouri DOT's higher priority from 1989 to 2000 was completing their section of the Avenue of the Saints and 2000 to 2010 for completing the Missouri portion of Interstate 72. Illinois DOT was struggling in 1990s with funding to finish existing highway upgrade projects (Interstate 39, Interstate 172) from the 1980s. =Illinois Route 336 (2001‚àípresent)= In 2009, the construction of Illinois Route 336 from Quincy was extended from Carthage to Macomb partially built along with former U. S. Route 136 alignment, on which it runs concurrently, and a new alignment bypassing Tennessee and Colchester to end temporarily west of Macomb. This provides these communities (Quincy, Carthage, Macomb) with a southwestern connection (Kansas City and St. Joseph, MO) to Interstate 72. A bypass around Macomb was under construction, with funding secured in 2014. It was eventually completed in 2018 but only opened one lane in each direction. =Cannon Ball Route / Illinois Route 110 (1917‚àí1941; 2010)= The Cannon Ball Trail Association, which was based in Leon, Iowa, marked the Missouri and Iowa portions of the route in 1912. The Chicago Auto Club marked the Illinois segment of the highway in 1913. By 1915, the route was considered \\"one of the best-marked highways between Quincy... and Chicago\\", and an extension from Quincy to the St. Louis - Kansas City highway at Monroe City was posted. In 1917 the Illinois State Highway Department, a precursor to the modern-day Illinois Department of Transportation, produced a Map of Marked Routes for the new automotive owner. The route from Hannibal, MO to Chicago, IL roughly paralleling the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, was marked as the Cannon Ball Route. In a joint resolution between the Illinois House and Senate in late May 2010,, 96th Illinois General Assembly. an expressway project connecting Chicago-to-Kansas City will be named Illinois Route 110. The path, 532 miles in total, follows parts of the existing Illinois Route 336, Interstate 88, Interstate 172, Interstate 72, Interstate 74, U.S. Route 136, U.S. Route 67, and connect the cities of Quincy, Macomb, Galesburg, a number of communities of the Chicago metropolitan area, including Chicago itself on Interstate 290. =River bridges= Since the 1970s, new Mississippi River highway bridges providing western access (Missouri, Iowa) to this region have been built: Mark Twain Memorial Bridge at Hannibal, Bayview Bridge at Quincy, Keokuk-Hamilton Bridge at Keokuk-Hamilton, and the Great River Bridge at Burlington. The 1928 Champ Clark Bridge at Louisiana, MO carrying U.S. Highway 54 was in poor condition and replaced by a new Champ Clark Bridge in 2019. https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/new-champ-clark-bridge-at-louisiana- mo-opens/article_f68f9fcd-8c5f-59ca-a227-4297329b2a7a.html The railroads, serving the region, Kansas City Southern Railway, BNSF Railway, and Norfolk Southern Railway have replaced, performed major upgrades, or demolished their Mississippi and Illinois river bridges (Keithsburg Rail Bridge). Some of these railroad bridges require further upgrades, based on the increasing transcontinental rail traffic. However, the Illinois River highway bridges providing eastern access to central Illinois, especially at Hardin, Florence, Meredosia, Beardstown, Havana, Lacon, and Henry are over 50 years old. While Illinois DOT has performed major maintenance on these structures, they are not currently funded for replacement. The first bridge to be replaced, as funds become available, is the Florence drawbridge on Illinois 100/106, formerly US 36 and 54. A replacement highway bridge at Meredosia was completed in 2018. The next planned bridge replacement is for US 67 at Beardstown. This is planned for the eventual upgrade of US 67 to an expressway (four lanes) north from Chaplin, IL. =U.S. Route 67 in Illinois= In 1990, U.S. Route 67 in Missouri was designated as NAFTA Corridor 61, but north of St. Louis U.S. Route 67 in Illinois, through the heart of this region, does not carry this NAFTA priority designation. Portions of U. S. Route 67 in Illinois north of Macomb were upgraded to a four lane expressway with bypasses around Monmouth and Roseville. It is four-lane but with many at-grade intersections and a few signals. A bypass around Jacksonville has been completed which extends from near Chapin to the north to near Roodhouse to the south. Except for the expressway near Jacksonville, no other sections from Macomb extending south to Jerseyville have been completed. The 4 lane divided highway starts again at the Jersey County line, south to Godfrey where it intersects with Illinois 255. A new section of four-lane highway, near Chapin, is to open in 2013. Sections farther north have some studies completed and right-of-way bought; no funding is in place to upgrade or complete further studies. =U.S. Route 34 to Burlington= Since 1993, the Illinois portion of U.S. Route 34 has been incomplete between the new Great River Bridge at Gulfport, Illinois to the eastern edge of Monmouth, Illinois. If and when the 4-lane to Monmouth is complete, U.S. Route 34 would merge with U.S. Route 67 at the south western edge of Monmouth and a new limited access bypass south and southeast of Monmouth connecting with the existing 4-lane U.S. Route 34 and continuing east to Galesburg. The Great River Bridge at Burlington was completed and open to traffic on October 4, 1993. The Iowa Department of Transportation completed the Des Moines to Burlington \\"Super-4\\" expressway project, Iowa Highway 163, on November 18, 2008. This expressway intersects the Avenue of the Saints at Mt. Pleasant. By 2020, U.S. Route 34 across southern Iowa between Ottumwa, Iowa and Plattsmouth, Nebraska is planned for Super-2 upgrades with a new bridge across the Missouri River bridge to Nebraska as part of these upgrades. Nebraska is studying an upgrade of their U.S. Route 34 section between Plattsmouth and Interstate 80, near Lincoln, Nebraska. =Macomb to Peoria Expressway= By 2003, the Macomb to Peoria Expressway, through the former coal mining regions of Fulton County was planned and routes proposed, but is not currently funded (DOT Job No. P94-025-00 URS Job No. 25364560; July 7, 2003). Hence, Peoria and Fulton Counties have no direct (short distance) highway route to Hannibal/Quincy or NAFTA trade routes to southwestern USA and Mexico. There are Fulton county opponents for improved highway access. The interchange (Exit 3) at Interstate 474 for this expressway segment was completed in the late 1970s.

It was first published by Stoddart in 2001 and reprinted several times and published as an ebook. The book examines the circumstances surrounding George's death during the Ipperwash standoff, the role of the Ontario Provincial Police, and the provincial government, Progressive Conservative under then Premier Mike Harris who had won the Ontario general election on June 26, 1995. On September 4, 1995, a group of unarmed members of Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation were protesting against the ongoing occupation of Stony Point land, which included burial grounds.During a confrontation, Ontario Provincial Police Acting OPP Sgt. Kenneth Deane fired on the demonstrators and killed Dudley George. Dean was convicted in 1997 \\"of criminal negligence causing death after a court ruled he did not have a \\"reasonable belief\\" that George was armed.\\" The Liberal government, under then Premier Dalton McGuinty called for an inquest which submitted its final report in 2005. The land had been appropriated by the federal government in 1942 under the War Measures Act to build a military camp, Camp Ipperwash, and never returned to the First Nations as had been agreed. Within 24 hours of the arrival of the Ontario Provincial Police on the scene, \\"one protester was shot and wounded, one was beaten until his heart stopped (he was revived), and Anthony \\"Dudley\\" George was shot dead\\". In 2004‚Äì2005, the book was adapted into a 2005 movie by CTV, which was broadcast on television on January 4, 2006. Reviews A 2004 review by Suzanne Methot in Quill and Quire described how the book by Edwards', who was an investigative reporter for The Toronto Star, \\"clearly detailed events\\" that led up to the Ipperwash crisis. Methot wrote that \\"Edwards‚Äôs exhaustive and well-written examination of Ipperwash shows ...[that] aboriginal people need protection from the police\\" in Canada. She also noted that the United Nation and Amnesty International raised concerns about the incident. Methot described how Edwards based his book on minutes of meetings between the newly elected Premier Mike Harris and the OPP and other documents obtained by Access to Information requests, trial transcripts, Special Investigations Unit interviews, officers‚Äô logs, and telephone conversations from the OPP command centre on the night of the shooting.\\" Ipperwash Inquiry The Ipperwash Inquiry resulted in a 4 volume report on the crisis.

Columbia University Press) Variation and Evolution in Plants is a book written by G. Ledyard Stebbins, published in 1950. It is one of the key publications embodying the modern synthesis of evolution and genetics, as the first comprehensive publication to discuss the relationship between genetics and natural selection in plants. The book has been described by plant systematist Peter H. Raven as \\"the most important book on plant evolution of the 20th century\\" and it remains one of the most cited texts on plant evolution. Origin The book is based on the Jesup Lectures that Stebbins delivered at Columbia University in October and November 1946 and is a synthesis of his ideas and the then current research on the evolution of seed plants in terms of genetics. Contents The book is written in fourteen parts: #Description and analysis of variation patterns #Examples of variation patterns within species and genera #The basis of individual variation #Natural selection and variation in populations #Genetic systems as factors in evolution #Isolation and the origin of species #Hybridization and its effects #Polyploidy I: occurrence and nature of polyploid types #Polyploidy II: geographic distribution and significance of polyploidy #Apomixis in relation to variation and evolution #Structural hybridity and the genetic system #Evolutionary trends I: the karyotype #Evolutionary trends II: External morphology #Fossils, modern distribution patterns and rates of evolution Significance The 643-page book cites more than 1,250 references and was the longest of the four books associated with the modern evolutionary synthesis. The other key works of the modern synthesis, whose publication also followed their authors' Jesup lectures, are Theodosius Dobzhansky's Genetics and the Origin of Species, Ernst Mayr's Systematics and the Origin of Species and George Gaylord Simpson's Tempo and Mode in Evolution. The great significance of Variation and Evolution in Plants is that it effectively killed any serious belief in alternative mechanisms of evolution for plants, such as Lamarckian evolution or soft inheritance, which were still upheld by some botanists. Legacy Stebbins book Flowering Plants: Evolution Above the Species Level was published in 1974 and was based on the Prather Lectures which he gave at Harvard. It is considered as an update to Variation and Evolution. In January 2000 a colloquium was held in Irvine, California, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Variation and Evolution in Plants. A 16 chapter book entitled Variation and evolution in Plants and Microorganisms: Toward a New Synthesis 50 Years After Stebbins () was released to mark the occasion.

A sintir, or guimbri, being played by Nuru Kane Lotar, a Berber guembri The sintir (), also known as the Guembri (), Gimbri or Hejhouj, is a three stringed skin-covered bass plucked lute used by the Gnawa people. It is approximately the size of a guitar, with a body carved from a log and covered on the playing side with camel skin. The camel skin has the same acoustic function as the membrane on a banjo. The neck is a simple stick with one short and two long goat strings that produce a percussive sound similar to a pizzicato cello or double bass. The goat gut strings are plucked downward with the knuckle side of the index finger and the inside of the thumb. The hollowed canoe shaped wooden body resonates a percussive tone created by knuckles slapping the camel neck top of the body while the thumb and index finger are plucking the strings. The lowest string on the sintir is a drone note and the second string, the highest in pitch, is tuned an octave higher and is never fretted. The third string is tuned a fourth above the drone. The buzzing sound often heard emanating from the sintir is caused by metal rings dangling off of a galvanized metal feather mounted on the end of the sintir's neck. The feather and rings vibrate in rhythm with the sintir. The body of the instrument is hollowed out from a single piece of wood, and covered with camel skin. The long neck passes through the top of the body and runs under the face, coming out through the skin near the base of the instrument, to serve as a tailpiece or string-carrier. The sliding leather tuning rings and the rattle-like metal sound modifier are commonly found in such West African instruments as the kora and the xalam (lute). The percussive playing style is reminiscent not only of West African technique but also of certain styles of American banjo picking. As the sintir is used mainly by Gnawa (North Africans of Sub-Saharan African descent), it is likely that the instrument derives from similar skin-covered lutes of the region around Mali or other areas of the Sahel (such as the ngoni, xalam, or hoddu). Styles Sintirs are usually applied to different styles of music: Tagnawit: is the music of the Gnawa people. The Guembri they use is the biggest: a long body rectangular in shape. There is a hole in the skin at the bridge area for enhanced acoustics. Three strings are used, two that reach the end of the neck, and one that reaches the middle. The two strings are tuned in fourths and are fixed to the circular neck using a special knotting. How the strings stay in tune is a mystery that only the Gnawa hold the secret for. The shorter string, which is also thinner, is tuned like the lowest string and is considered a drone string. Depending on the area where the Gnawa Zaouia (shrine) is located, there are different keys to the tuning. The most common ones however are C, F, D and G. When the Gnawa are clapping and not playing with the Krakebs (a form of castanets), it is not uncommon to add a piece of metal that rings when the Guembri is played (Sersar). The plucking of the strings is done with the thumb and/or the index, and sometimes the player hits the body under the strings for a percussive sound. The Gnawa player who plays with the Guembri is called the Maalem, Master of Ceremonies. The Gnawa also refer to the Guembri as Hajhouj or Sintir. The most popular Guembri players in traditional and popular music are Abderhmane Paco, Mahmoud Gania, Mustapha Baqbou, Hassan Hakmoun, Hajjoub Soudani, and Hamid al Kasri. Izlan s Tamazight: sung poetry by the Berbers of the Middle Atlas and High Atlas. It has a body the size of a lute or mandolin, but the neck is usually longer and thicker. Unlike the Gumebri of Gnawa, this one has wooden tuners. There are usually four strings (although five is not unusual) tuned in fourths as well. Common tunings are A standard or C standard. It is played similar to a lute, however it has its own tonal range, scales and key progressions that are particular to the Berbers. The main artist plays the lute and sings, accompanied by bendir players and backing singers which can include both men and women. To the Berbers, this type of Guembri is more widely known as Loutar. Popular Loutar players are Mohamed Rouicha, Hammou Oulyazid, Hajjaoui and Maghni. Malhoun: sung poetry in Moroccan colloquial Arabic (Darija). It is similar to Lotar in shape, but much smaller in size. It is not used as the main string instrument; rather it is used to provide timbre contrast to the music. It is sometimes called Gounibri as well.

It is his first post-Cold War novel, detailing an undercover operation to bring down a major international arms dealer. Plot summary Jonathan Pine, a former British soldier, is the night manager. We first meet him in that capacity at the Hotel Meister Palace in Zurich. He is on duty when the \\"worst man in the world\\", Richard Onslow Roper, arrives with his entourage on a cold, blizzardy night. Roper is a billionaire criminal who traffics illegal arms and drugs. The novel is about Pine's preoccupation with undoing Roper's criminal enterprise, which began earlier, in Cairo, where Pine was working as the night manager at the luxurious Queen Nefertiti hotel. One night in Cairo, Pine met Sophie, a French-Arab woman, the mistress of the hotel owner, Freddie Hamid, who had ties to Roper. Sophie characterised Roper as \\"the worst man in the world\\". She provided Pine with incriminating documents, asking him to forward them to the Egyptian authorities. Pine did so but disregarded her warning that Roper had ties to British intelligence. He forwarded copies to a friend with MI6. A short time later, Sophie was murdered. Several years later, Pine is working in Switzerland. He is approached by ex-SIS Chief Leonard Burr and his senior civil servant backer Rex Goodhew, who have set up a small counter arms- proliferation office and are planning an elaborate sting operation against Roper. Eager to avenge Sophie, Pine agrees to go undercover to infiltrate Roper's vast criminal empire. All the while, however, the operation is jeopardised by an inter-agency turf war within the intelligence community, with a suspicion that collusion with Roper is taking place somewhere. Burr's operation, a joint effort between his group and sympathetic American colleagues, is code-named \\"Limpet.\\" The first stage requires Pine to fabricate a criminal identity and cover story and head to the Bahamas, the location of Roper's primary residence. Pine wins the confidence of Roper by \\"rescuing\\" his son from a phony kidnapping orchestrated by Burr and suffering a severe beating from the \\"kidnappers\\". When Pine recovers, Roper recruits him into his organisation, in preparation for his latest and largest illegal arms deal, with a Colombian drug cartel. Unknown to Pine, another part of Operation Limpet is that the cartel's lawyer, Dr. Paul Apostoll, is secretly an informant for the American FBI and DEA. He explains to Burr that Roper has convinced the cartel to organise its bands of enforcers along the lines of a professional army, in preparation for the inevitable day when the Western nations to whom they peddle cocaine decide to take direct military action against them. Roper has agreed to supply the cartel with military-grade weaponry and training from experienced mercenaries, in exchange for a large shipment of cocaine, at a discount price, which Roper will then sell in Europe for an enormous profit. Apostoll plants the suggestion in his employers' minds that Roper's normal front man, Major Corkoran, is unreliable, forcing Roper to use Pine instead. Corkoran is convinced that Pine is a plant, but cannot find any proof. While signing the paperwork Pine gathers information to convict Roper. He has also fallen in love with Roper's innocent English mistress, Jed. However, corrupt factions within both the CIA and British Intelligence are profiting from the illegal arms trade and mount their own operation, which they call 'Flagship', to scuttle Burr's sting operation. They subtly threaten Goodhew, who backs off the whole case, and betray Apostoll's status as an informant to the cartels. Before being killed, Apostoll reveals Pine's true identity to Roper under torture. Pine is held captive on Roper's yacht and tortured. The outlines of Flagship are confessed to Burr by a drunken Harry Palfrey, privy to it all but now stricken by conscience. Burr also puts additional pressure on Palfrey by faking correspondence between himself, Goodhew, and his American partner to the effect that they know about Palfrey's duplicity, to get him to work for them. To save Pine, Burr sacrifices his operation and allows Roper to get away, by contacting Roper's \\"satrap,\\" Sir Anthony Bradshaw, and bluffing that he has enough evidence to send Roper to prison with harsh consequences for any associates, but will stay his hand if Pine and Jed are released unharmed. Bradshaw and Roper fall for the deception, and Roper complies. With his life falling apart, Palfrey commits suicide. Pine and Jed are saved. They live together in his isolated cottage at the Lanyon, a few miles from Land's End.  Continuity  The Night Manager features the re- appearance of Harry Palfrey, the Legal Adviser to the British Secret Intelligence Service, who first appeared in The Russia House. Sir Anthony Bradshaw previously appeared in the epilogue of The Secret Pilgrim, in which Leonard Burr also appears as the youthful Chief of the Service.  Adaptation  On 10 January 2015, production of an adaptation was announced. Directed by Susanne Bier, the six-part mini-series aired on BBC One in the UK and began airing on AMC in the U.S. in April 2016. The cast includes Tom Hiddleston as Pine, Hugh Laurie as Roper, Olivia Colman as Burr, Tom Hollander as Corkoran, and Elizabeth Debicki as Jed.

The winery was founded in 1864 by Don Eloy Lecanda y Chaves, who planted various grapes from the Bordeaux wine region of France, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, which are still being used in the wines today.J. Gordon (ed) Opus Vino pg 215, DK Publishing New York 2010, Since 1982, the same year that the Ribera del Duero was granted Denominaci√≥n de Origen (DO) status, the winery has been owned by the √Ålvarez family who are members of the Primum Familiae Vini. In comparing the wines of Spain to the First Growth wines of Bordeaux, wine expert Hugh Johnson, after comparing Rioja producers Marqu√©s de Riscal and Marqu√©s de Murrieta to Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild and Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild, respectively, stated: \\"Vega Sicilia is the Latour; but Latour of a vintage that has raisined the grapes and fried the picking crews.\\"‚Äîa reference to the significantly warmer climate and different growing conditions of the Ribera del Duero.High Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 429‚Äì432 Simon and Schuster 1989 Vega Sicilia's wines are recognised worldwide as some of the finest and most valued red wines on the market, with its top wine selling for an average of $388 per bottle. History The Duero river running through the Castile and Le√≥n region Vega Sicilia was founded by Eloy Lecanda y Chaves, a Spanish winemaker who was trained in the Bordeaux wine region of France. When he returned to his homeland of Castile, Don Eloy Lecanda brought with him several Bordeaux grape varieties.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 430-435 Workman Publishing 2001 In the 20th century, Vega Sicilia earned a reputation as being one of the most notable wines in Spain.A. Bespaloff Complete Guide to Wine pg 174-175 Penguin Books 1994 Over its history, the winery has had many notable winemakers including Mariano Garc√≠a who was winemaker from 1966 to 1996 before moving on to produce his own labels. Today, the current winemaker is Xavier Aus√°s. Name Though it not known exactly why the owner of Vega Sicilia picked this name for his winery, the Sicilia in the name refers to the Catholic Saint Cecilia rather than the island of Sicily. The name Vega Sicilia has appeared in Spanish documents that existed several centuries before the winery was founded though the exact origin of the name is currently unknown. Despite the similarities of the name, Vega Sicilia has no connection to the island of Sicily of the Italian wines of that region. The word Vega refers to the green vegetation that grows along the riverbank of the Duero while Sicilia refers to Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of musicians, after whom several villages in Castile and Le√≥n is named after. The winery's founder Don Eloy Lecanda y Chaves left no known written records on why he chose Vega Sicilia as his winery's name. Vineyards When Don Eloy Lecanda y Chaves first planted the vineyards of Vega Sicilia he included Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo and Malbec in his plantings. The extensive use of Bordeaux varieties was unusual in the Ribera del Duero at the time and though future plantings have focused more on Tempranillo, nearly 40% of Vega Sicilia's vineyards are still planted with traditional Bordeaux varieties including nearly 25% planted to Cabernet Sauvignon alone. Many of Vega Sicilia's 250 acres are planted with old vines, some more than 100 years old, and thus usually produce a very low yield during harvest. In fact, many of the plantings that go into the flagship Unico wines are often harvested at less than one ton per acre. Wines Vega Sicilia is noted for its patience in winemaking and willingness to hold onto their inventory and age their wines in the barrel and bottle for many years until it fits the style that the producers are looking for. Depending on the vintage, the wine could be held by Vega Sicilia for decades until it is released. For example, in 1991 the winery released both the 1968 and 1982 vintages after 23 and 9 years aging. Vega Sicilia produces three different types of wine. * Unico - This Gran Reserva wine is the signature wine of Vega Sicilia that is usually released 10 years after vintage though some bottlings may not be released for up to 15 years or even longer. Taken from some of the oldest vines in the Ribera del Duero, the wine is mostly Tempranillo (approximately 80% but depending on vintage) and Cabernet Sauvignon (approximately 20%). In an average vintage, Unico will account for a little less than a third of Vega Sicilia's production. Though in poor vintages, the winery may not produce any Unico. * Valbuena 5¬∞ - The 5¬∞ indicates that this wine has been aged for five years prior to release. The wine is composed mostly of Tempranillo, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. *Vega Sicilia Unico Reserva Especial - A non-vintage blend of different Unicos, aged at least for 10 years. This wine can include grapes from vintages harvested more than 30 years apart and usually only available to private customers under strict allocation. =Other wines= Until 1998, Vega Sicilia also produced a Valbuena 3¬∞ (indicating three years of aging prior to release), although this wine has since been removed from the market. In 1991, the Alvarez family established Ali√≥n winery next door to Vega Sicilia with the aim of producing more modern style Tinto Fino red wines that are aged in new French oak barrels. In 1997, they established the Pint√≠a winery in the nearby Toro wine region.

He previously led the Vietnamese forces in Cambodia throughout the 1980s. He was regarded as a conservativeBolton 1999, 176 who advocated maintaining tight party control over domestic policies. Early life and military career L√™ ƒê·ª©c Anh was born in Ph√∫ L·ªôc District in Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø Province. In August 1945, he joined the army. From October 1948 to 1950, he was chief of staff of the 7th Military Region, 8th Military Region and administrative region of Sai Gon-Cho Lon. From 1951 to 1954, served as Deputy Chief of Staff, acting Chief of Staff of Cochinchina. From August 1963, he served as Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. February 1964, to the South Vietnam, position of Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation Armed Force (Vietcong). Le Duc Anh during the Vietnam War as the deputy commander of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam. After his participation as a member of Vi·ªát Minh on the led by Ho Chi Minh August Revolution 1945, which led to the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) on 2 September 1945, he began his military service in the North Vietnamese People's Army, the precursor of the Vietnamese People's Army ( Qu√¢n ƒê·ªôi Nh√¢n D√¢n Vi·ªát Nam). First, he was a political officer in a battalion and then in the 301th Regiment. He was then first from October 1948 to 1950 Political Officer in the Military Region No. 7 (ƒê√¥ng Nam B·ªô) with the seat in Saigon. In this function he took part between 1951 and 1954 in the Indochina War. After the Indochina Conference in 1954 in Geneva, he was an officer in the General Staff of the People's Army and promoted there in 1958 to the colonel (ƒê·∫°i t√°). Between 1964 and 1968 he was head of the Human Resources Department of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (Vi·ªát C·ªông). In 1969 he became commander of Military Region No. 9 in the Mekong Delta (ƒë·ªìng b·∫±ng s√¥ng C·ª≠u Long). After his promotion to Lieutenant General (Trung t∆∞·ªõng), he participated in the Vietnam War on the Ho Chi Minh campaign against South Vietnam from December 1974 to April 1975 as commander of the units in West Vietnam (H∆∞·ªõng TƒÅy Nam). In May 1976 he was then again commander of the Military Region No. 9, before he was commander and political commissar of the Military Region No. 7 in Ho Chi Minh City from June 1978 to 1981. As such, in 1980 he was promoted to Colonel-General (Th∆∞·ª£ng t∆∞·ªõng). As a general Anh was the commander of the Vietnamese forces in the People's Republic of Kampuchea in the 1980s.Slocomb, Margaret: \\"The People's Republic of Kampuchea, 1979-1989: The revolution after Pol Pot\\" He formulated five key points for the defence of Cambodia against Khmer Rouge re-infiltration and was the architect of the K5 Plan.Luciolli, Esmeralda: \\"Le mur de bambou, ou le Cambodge apr√®s Pol Pot.\\" Political career Later he entered politics and he held a succession of government posts. During his time as Defence Minister General he was already a major conservative voice in Vietnam's political system. In 1989, after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, he warned about the alleged threat of the West undermining Vietnam's Communist Party, arguing for more army involvement in politics \\"at a time when Vietnamese socialism was under attack\\".Thayer 1999, p. 14 Between 1976 and 1997 L√™ ƒê·ª©c Anh was also a member of the National Assembly (Qu·ªëc h·ªôi Vi·ªát Nam). From 1991 (to 1993) Anh controlled Vietnamese policy towards Cambodia and China and therefore was involved in the normalisation of Vietnam's relations with China in November 1991.Wurfel 1999, 150 He was the first Vietnamese president to visit Beijing in 38 years since an official visit in November 1993 to discuss economic relations and territorial disputes in the South China Sea; however, consensus was achieved only on the former issue.Wurfel 1999, p. 152 In 1981 he was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense and Head of the Political Department in the Ministry of Defense (B·ªô Qu·ªëc ph√≤ng). In the same year he was appointed commander of the Vietnamese army during the occupation of Cambodia and there in 1984 promoted to general. Between 1982 and 2001 he was also a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam (B·ªô Ch√≠nh tr·ªã Ban Ch·∫•p h√†nh Trung ∆∞∆°ng ƒê·∫£ng C·ªông s·∫£n Vi·ªát Nam). After his return, he was the successor of the late in office General L√™ Tr·ªçng T·∫•n from December 1986 to February 1987 Chief of the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army (T·ªïng Tham m∆∞u tr∆∞·ªüng Qu√¢n ƒë·ªôi Nh√¢n d√¢n Vi·ªát Nam). He then followed General VƒÉn Ti·∫øn D≈©ng as Secretary of Defense and retained this position until his replacement by General ƒêo√†n Khu√™ in 1992. President In September 1992, he was elected to the new post of state president, replacing a collective presidency. Although a mostly symbolic position, the presidency became much more important during his tenure. On September 23, 1992, he was the successor to V√µ Ch√≠ C√¥ng Chairman of the State Council and thus President of Vietnam. This predominantly ceremonial office he held until his replacement by Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c L∆∞∆°ng on 24 September 1997. For his services, General L√™ ƒê·ª©c Anh received several awards, including the Order of the Golden Star (Hu√¢n ch∆∞∆°ng Sao v√†ng) and the Ho Chi Minh Order (Hu√¢n ch∆∞∆°ng H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh). Anh is considered by many to have been (ideologically) the most conservative (communist) among the three political leaders during his tenure. Prime Minister V√µ VƒÉn Ki·ªát was associated with the reform campBolton 1999, p. 182 and therefore often disagreed with Anh. Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Vietnam ƒê·ªó M∆∞·ªùi was ideologically more flexible and effectively came to be seen as representing the middle ground between Anh and Ki·ªát, but seems to have tended towards conservative positions.Bolton 1999, 182-83 His opposition to Ki·ªát's reform ambitions are part of a long-lasting rivalry. In 1991, Anh joined ƒê·ªó M∆∞·ªùi to support him in his candidacy for party leadership against V√µ VƒÉn Ki·ªát.Bolton 1999, 187 The Ki·ªát camp later spread rumours about wrongdoings Anh was said to be involved in Cambodia. =Resignation= In mid- November 1996, he was hospitalized after a major stroke. This was at a time when the reform camp that he opposed was in decline and for some time his illness seemed to change the dynamics within the political leadership, weakening the conservative camp and reinvigorating the reform camp. However, Party leader ƒê·ªó M∆∞·ªùi led a counter-attack against the reform camp, warning of the dangers of the 'current market economy'. The conservative camp gained further momentum when Anh surprisingly recovered in April 1997. He stepped down as president in September 1997 after the Communist Party Congress, was replaced by Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c L∆∞∆°ng. He was an Advisor of the Party's Central Committee from December 1997 ‚Äì 2001.

Large bells are made by casting bell metal in moulds designed for their intended musical pitches. Further fine tuning is then performed using a lathe to shave metal from the bell to produce a distinctive bell tone by sounding the correct musical harmonics. Bellfounding in East Asia dates from about 2000 BC and in Europe from the 4th or 5th century CE. In Britain, archaeological excavations have revealed traces of furnaces, showing that bells were often cast on site in pits in a church or its grounds. Centralised foundries became common when railways allowed easy transportation of bells, leading to the dominance of such as the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. Elsewhere in the world a number of foundries are still active, some using traditional methods, and some using the latest foundry techniques. Modern foundries produce harmonically tuned bells using principles established in the late 19th century; some of these are also highly decorative. Early history Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng, dated 433 BC Bellfounding has been important throughout the history of ancient civilizations. Eastern bells, known for their tremendous size, were some of the earliest bells, made many centuries before the European Iron Age. The earliest bells were made of pottery, developing later into the casting of metal bells. Archaeological evidence of bellfounding appears in Neolithic China. The earliest metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, are dated to about 2000 BC.Falkenhausen (1994), 132, Appendix I pp. 329, 342. Development =Britain= Portable bells came to Britain with the spread of Celtic Christianity, and most of those still remaining share an association with Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Bellfounding in Britain was due to monasticism which provided demand and expertise in the early medieval period. Large bells in England are mentioned by Bede as early as 670 CE and by the seventh or eighth century the use of bells had become incorporated into church services. Nearly 200 years later, in the tenth century is the first record of a complete peal of bells. The chronologies of the abbot Ingulf suggest that Thurcytel, the first Abbot of Crowland, presented the Abbey with a bell named Guthlac, after which his successor, Egelric the Elder cast an additional six bells‚Äîtwo large, two of medium size and two small‚Äîto complete a peal of seven. The same period saw other ecclesiastics involved in the founding of bells. St. Dunstan, \\"The Chief of Monks\\", was an expert worker in metals and known bell caster. Two bells were cast under his direction at Abingdon which also held two others cast by St. Ethelwold. Methods of moulding by lost-wax casting were described by the thirteenth-century Benedictine monk Walter de Odyngton of Evesham Abbey. Bellfounding as a commercial trade followed later. Independent craftsmen set up permanent foundries in towns, such as London, Gloucester, Salisbury, Bury St Edmunds, Norwich, and Colchester. Although these attracted trade from the surrounding countryside, mediaeval founders did not confine themselves to bellmaking as their only source of livelihood. Instead, they often combined it with related trades, such as metal ware, utensil manufacturing and gunmaking. Some founders were itinerant, traveling from church to church to cast bells on site. These early bells had poor tone, due to both their variable alloy composition and a lack of understanding of producing the correct shape for a harmonic tone; but over time the bell-shape was improved. The angles at the crown and soundbow were gradually flattened out and the waist became shorter, flaring more toward the mouth. Although tuning methods were still uncertain and empirical, sets of bells in diatonic scales were installed at important parish churches and monasteries. Archaeological excavations of churchyards in Britain have revealed furnaces, which suggests that bells were often cast on site in pits dug in the building grounds. Great Tom of Lincoln Cathedral was cast in the Minster yard in 1610, and the great bell of Canterbury in the Cathedral yard in 1762. When the casting was complete, a tower was built over the casting pit, and the bell raised directly up into the tower. In some instances, such as in Kirkby Malzeard and Haddenham the bells were actually cast in the church. =The Low Countries= Fran√ßois Hemony (c. 1609‚Äì1667) and his brother Pieter, Pierre, or Peter Hemony (1619‚Äì1680) were the greatest carillon bell founders in the history of the Low Countries. They developed the carillon, in collaboration with Jacob van Eyck, into a full-fledged musical instrument by casting the first tuned carillon in 1644. The Hemony Brothers are regarded as the first of the modern western bell-founders who used a scientific approach to casting the optimum shape and tuning bells to harmonic principles. Materials The Tsar Bell showing crack caused by uneven cooling during fire-fighting. =Bell metal= Bells for the intention of producing functional sound are usually made by casting bell metal, an alloy of bronze. Much experimentation with composition has existed throughout history; the bells of Henry II had nearly twice as much copper as tin, while much earlier Assyrian bronze bells had ten times the amount of copper to tin. The recognized best composition for bell metal though is a ratio of approximately 80 per cent copper and 20 per cent tin. Bell metal of these ratios has been used for more than 3,000 years and is known for its resonance and \\"attractive sound\\". Tin and copper are relatively soft metals that will deform on striking. By alloying, a harder and more rigid metal is created but also one with more elasticity than the use of one alone. This allows for a better resonance and causes the bell to \\"vibrate like a spring when struck\\", a necessary quality as the clapper may strike at speeds of up to 600 miles per hour. The forces holding the tin and copper together cause vibrations rather than cracks when the bell is struck which creates a resonant tone. This metal combination also results in a tough, long-wearing material that is resistant to oxidation and subject only to an initial surface weathering. Verdigris forms a protective patina on the surface of the bell which coats it against further oxidation. The hardest and strongest bronze contains large amounts of tin and little lead though an alloy with more than 25 per cent tin will have a low melting point and become brittle and susceptible to cracking. This low melting point proved to be the nemesis of Russia's third attempt at casting the Tsar Bell from 1733 to 1735. The bell was never rung, and a huge slab cracked off (11.5 tons) during a fire in the Kremlin in 1737 before it could ever be raised from its casting pit. Burning timber fell into the casting pit, and the decision was whether to let it burn and risk melting the bell or pour water on it and risk causing it cracking from cooling it too quickly. The latter risk was chosen and, as feared, because of uneven cooling, the bell was damaged. The present bell is sometimes referred to as Kolokol III (Bell III), because it is the third recasting; remnants from the old bell were melted down and the metal reused to cast the new bell. This practice was fairly commonplace, as the metal materials were very costly. Bell metal was considered so valuable that the first bronze coins for England were made in France out of melted-down old bells. =Other metals= Other materials occasionally used for bell casting are brass or iron. Steel was tried during the busy church-building period of mid-nineteenth England, for its economy over bronze, but was found not to be durable and manufacture ceased in the 1870s. They have also been made of glass, but although bells of this type produced a successful tone, this substance being very brittle was unable to withstand the continued use of the clapper. By popular tradition the bell metal contained gold and silver, as component parts of the alloy, as it is recorded that rich and devout people threw coins into the furnace when bells were cast in the churchyard. The practice was believed to improve the tone of the bell. This however is probably erroneous as there are no authentic analyses of bell metal, ancient or modern, which show that gold or silver has ever been used as a component part of the alloy. If used to any great extent, the addition would injure the tone not improve it. Small quantities of other metals found in old bell metal are likely to be impurities in the metals used to form the alloy. Decorative bells can be made of such materials as horn, wood, and clay. Casting process Casting bells by pouring molten metal into the moulds The principle of casting bells has remained essentially the same since the 12th century. Bells are cast mouth down, in a two-part mould consisting of the core and a mantle or cope placed over it. These are produced to accurate profiles so an air space exists between them which is filled by the molten metal. =Measurement and templating= Firstly the bell profile is calculated to exact specifications to ensure it can be properly tuned. Two wooden templates called \\"strickle boards\\" are used to shape the moulding clay. One matches the dimensions of the outer bell (called the case or cope); the other matches that of the inner bell (called the core). Generally these boards are stock profiles that have been developed, empirically and by calculation, for each size of bell. Bell moulds in the bell museum (Glockenmuseum) in Gescher, Germany. The wooden strickle boards, which are rotatable templates to ensure the correct mould profiles, can clearly be seen. =Constructing the mould= An exact model of the inner face of the bell is built on a base-plate using porous materials such as coke, stone, or brick. It is then covered first with sand or loam (sometimes mixed with straw and horse manure) and clay to form a smooth profile. This is given a profile by means of the inner strickle board. It also known as the \\"false bell\\" and is then dried with gentle heat in a kiln. The false bell is then covered with molten wax and figures and inscriptions, also made of wax, applied on top by hand. The false bell is painted over with three coats of fireproof clay and then enclosed by a steel mantle overcasing. The empty space between the false bell and the mantle is filled in with cement and left to harden before the mantle is lifted off. The false bell is chipped away from the inner core to leave the wax and cement. Any leftover scraps of the false bell are removed with a blow torch. The mould is then set over a coke fire to melt the remaining wax and evaporate any water that has accumulated. Instead of using a steel mantle and cement, the inner and outer moulds can also be made completely out of loam. In that case, the moulds are usually constructed inside out‚Äîfirst the inner mould on top of a coke, stone, or brick core, then the false bell including wax decorations as above, and finally the outer mould with added iron ring and fiber (e.g. hemp) reinforcements. At this stage the steel staple, from which the clapper will hang, is inserted. Separating agents are used to prevent the false bell from sticking too closely to both of the moulds. Finally, after lifting up the outer mould, the false bell can be destroyed and the outer mould lowered back down onto the inner mould, ready for casting. The \\"false bell\\" method. The core has a clay false bell shaped on it using strickle boards. The cope (at top) is moulded round the false bell to receive its imprint. Then the cope is lifted to remove the false bell, as shown here. The cope is then lowered back onto the core and the molten metal fills the void created. =Pouring the metal= The outer bell mould in the cope or mantle is lowered over the inner mould and they are clamped together, leaving a space between them, which the molten metal will fill. The complete mould is sometimes in a casting pit which stabilises it and enables slower cooling, or above ground in open air, depending on the foundry's traditions. The raw materials of copper and tin are melted in a furnace until they become liquid at a temperature of approximately . Often scrap bronze from old bells is added, especially if the bell being cast is a replacement for an existing bell, which is in effect being recycled. The liquid metal is skimmed to remove impurities, then poured into the mould, using a tilting ladle suspended from a crane. As the metal enters the mould, holes in the top of the mantle ensure that gases are able to escape, otherwise there would be a risk the bell would be porous and susceptible to cracking. Porosity can also develop if the mould is damp, or is not at the proper temperature, or the metal when poured is not hot enough. The casting is allowed to cool for up to several days and large bells can take over a week to cool. Small bells, those under , can be removed from the moulds the following day. =Cooling= After the bell and equipment have cooled, the mould, containing the newly cast bell, is raised from the pit by the projecting trunnions of the bell case. The core plate is unclamped and the core broken out. The bell is then carefully extracted from the case. At this stage, any remaining loam adhered to the bell is brushed away and flash (excess metal), which may have formed below the bell's rim‚Äîowing to mould contraction in the presence of hot metal‚Äîis trimmed off. This completes the casting process. Tuning Bells are cast with defined profiles which were perfected in the early 20th Century to ensure they can be harmonically tuned by the removal of small amounts of metal to adjust their harmonics. For a carillion or an English ring of full circle bells, the strike note of each bell must accord with the diatonic scale of the others, and to produce that the harmonics of each bell must be tuned to harmonise with its strike note. As a bell's strike note is affected slightly by its harmonics this can be an iterative process. An initial assessment is made to arrive at an average pitch for the scale, as this is dependent on casting tolerances. Because of this compromise large bells are therefore not always tuned to concert pitch. Much experimentation and testing was devoted over the centuries to determining the exact shape that would result in the best tone. In the early days of bellfounding, bells were profiled using empirical methods and the inside of the bell or edge of the lip was chipped away to adjust the tuning after being cast. With the invention of modern metalworking machinery, this was more accurately done using a vertical tuning lathe, which could remove metal at any position up the waist of the bell, thus allowing tuning of different harmonics, and the reliable introduction of harmonic tuning into the manufacturing process. Metal can only be removed during the tuning process; it cannot be added. Therefore a bell is cast with slightly thicker profile than is needed for harmonic tuning. To tune the bell, it is placed on a vertical tuning lathe and metal removed by a cutting tool as it rotates. The bell tuner must be highly skilled and formerly used tuning forks to establish the tuning; this is now done electronically, but still requires great manual skill in the use of the cutting tool. Only by this means can bells be harmonically tuned. The bell's strongest harmonics are tuned to be at octave intervals below the nominal note, but other notes also need to be brought into their proper relationship.In general, the smaller the bell the higher the pitch, with the frequency of a bell's note varying with the square of its thickness and inversely with its diameter. The thickness of a church bell at its thickest part (the \\"sound bow\\") is usually one thirteenth its diameter. If the bell is mounted as cast, without any tuning, it is called a \\"maiden bell\\". Russian bells are treated in this way and cast for a certain tone. Cutaway drawing of a bell, showing the clapper and interior. The profile of the bell thickness can be seen, and is thickest at soundbow near the bottom (the lip). Fitting the clapper The preferred material for the bell clapper was wrought iron but because this is no longer obtainable wood or cast iron clappers are now used. The clapper or tongue is manufactured in a similar process as the bell. Special care is given to cast the clapper at the proper weight, as a clapper that is too light will not bring out the true tones of the bell and a heavy clapper might cause the bell to crack. Holes are drilled into the top of the bell, and the clapper is attached to the inside of the bell either by a metal link or a leather strap. Finally the bell is installed in the tower.

There were four built between 1849 and 1885. It was located at Cape San Blas in the northwestern part of the state. Due to beach erosion and weather damage over the decades, it was moved in 2014 to Port St. Joe. The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. History The first Cape San Blas Light was completed in 1849 with an appropriation of $8,000 made 2 years earlier. The shoals running out from the cape extended and made it dangerous for all vessels nearing the coast. If the light had been high enough it could have been seen for and afforded protection to vessels going to and from Tortugas to New Orleans, but the light from the tower was visible only half that distance. The site was \\"deemed to be entirely secure from overflow or inundation\\" by the collector of customs at Apalachicola, Florida, who selected it, with the assistance of \\"two of our most experienced pilots.\\" The lighthouse erected in 1849 then \\"fell down during a gale in the autumn of 1851\\" and on August 31, 1852, Congress appropriated $12,000 for rebuilding it. The new structure was completed in 1856. It had been completed only a few months when during the severe storm of August 30, 1856, it was destroyed. \\"The sea rose so high,\\" the United States Lighthouse Board reported, \\"that the waves struck the floor of the keeper‚Äôs dwelling, elevated above the ground, and about above the ordinary tides. A lagoon now occupies the site of the lighthouse.\\" On March 3, 1857, Congress, for the third time, appropriated money for a lighthouse at Cape San Blas. This appropriation was for $20,000 and the new lighthouse was first lighted with a third-order lens on May 1, 1858. The light station sustained serious damage at the hands of Union troops aboard the USS Kingfisher that landed in 1862 during the Civil War. The keeper's dwelling was completely destroyed and the door frames and sashes of the tower were torn or burnt out. Repairs were made, a new illuminating apparatus was provided, and the light was re-exhibited on July 23, 1865. In 1869 the beach in front of the lighthouse was reported to be washing away and would need protection against encroachments of the sea during heavy storms. In 1877 Congress appropriated $2,000 for protecting the site after the Lighthouse Board had reported 2 years earlier \\"The base of the tower is very nearly at the same level as the sea, which is but little more than 150 feet distant, the shore being of shifting sand. In a violent hurricane, it is feared, the tower may be undermined.\\" The Board had asked for $5,000 to protect the site and reported in 1879 that, as it was found \\"impracticable to build a jetty for $2,000 that can protect the site from the encroachment of the sea, no further action has been taken in the matter.\\" The third Cape San Blas lighthouse (built in 1859) was destroyed by a storm in 1882 Finally in 1881 the Board reported \\"The sea has been encroaching on this tower until its base is in the water. Brush mattresses were made, pinned down to the sand with small iron screw piles, covered with sand and occasionally blocks of concrete, to further check such encroachment, but the almost constant surf, beating against the mattresses, tore them to pieces. An appropriation for a new tower, further inland is badly needed. It is recommended that a skeleton iron tower be erected; then if the sea again encroaches, it could be taken down and re erected. The new tower will cost $25,000.\\" The following year the Board noted \\"No appropriation was made; the site remained unprotected and on July 3, 1882, the tower was overthrown and completely destroyed.\\" The Board strongly recommended that the tower be replaced on a safe site at an early date, there being no intervening light between San Blas and Pensacola, Florida, 120 miles (190 km or 220 km) distant. An appropriation for a fourth tower was made available in 1883. The remains of the third tower were then distant from the shore, and the sea continued to erode the beach. By 1885 a fourth tower, a skeleton tower of iron, and two dwellings for keepers had been erected and the light was first displayed on June 30, 1885. The light had a third-order lens, showing alternate red and white flashes with 30 seconds intervals. The focal plane, above sea level, lit the entire horizon. In 1887 the sea was reported again gradually cutting away the shore and during the year had washed away about one-third the distance to where the new tower had been built (300 feet or 100 m). Two years later only of beach remained and the Board reported \\"It is more than probable that this will be mostly washed away in the next 4 months.\\" It was, therefore, recommended \\"that the tower and dwellings be taken down and removed to a point on the inside of the peninsula a little less than , about northwest from its present position where there is a good site and of water, in St. Joseph Bay, within of it. This location is such that the bearing of the San Blas Shoals will be the same as now, and the increase of 1¬Ω miles in the distance from the shore will be of little importance so far as its value as a coast light is concerned. It is estimated that to make the change will cost $20,000. The present site cannot be saved except at great cost.\\" Nothing had been done, however, by Congress and by early 1890 the tower was only from the sea at high-water mark. Later that year, however, an appropriation of $20,000 was made to remove the tower and dwellings to the point inside the peninsula. Condemnation proceedings to obtain title to the new site, however, dragged on until 1894 when on October 8 and October 9 a gale badly damaged the lighthouse extinguishing the light and wrecking the keeper's dwelling. So much of the cape was washed away that the tower now stood in the water. Before the tower could be removed to the new site, it was decided in 1895 to remove the station to Black's Island, in St. Joseph Bay, which the President ordered reserved for lighthouse purposes. The work of dismantling the skeleton iron tower was begun in February 1896 and carried on until April 30 of that year when it was stopped because the appropriation was exhausted. The two keeper's houses had been relocated on Black's Island, the foundation for the tower was in place and three-fourths of the concrete work had been done, when it was estimated that $4,500 more would be required to finish the work. This was appropriated in June 1897. Four months later, however, the light had been reestablished in the old tower, now in the water at the south point of Cape San Blas. In 1899 the Board reported \\"after careful consideration of all the conditions affecting the choice of a proper site, the Board has concluded that the light should be reconstructed on the shell ridge about N. by W. from its present location. It is estimated that this can be done at a cost not exceeding $15,000.\\" This sum was appropriated on June 6, 1900, at which time the Board reported: \\"that the property and material stored at Black‚Äôs Island was being cared for by a watchman appointed for the purpose.\\" By 1901 nothing had been done about moving the tower and the Board reported \\"the advisability of removing the station to a new site is being considered, or of building a permanent keeper‚Äôs dwelling in place of the present temporary buildings, repairing the present light tower and permitting it to remain in the old location. The point of land on which the tower stands has made out until the beach at the nearest point is 100 or more feet distant from the tower. As this movement is increasing, it may become necessary to move the structure of the station to a new site.\\" In 1903 the Board sought and obtained authority from Congress to use $7,000 of the $15,000 appropriated for moving the tower, to erect two keeper's dwellings at the old site. These were completed in 1905. The light remained in the old tower until 1919. In 1916 it was reported \\"The sea is again making inroads on the station and a project for its removal has been tentatively approved.\\" The new site was one-fourth mile (400 m) north of the old tower on the peninsula and on land heretofore reserved for military purposes, which the President forthwith reserved for lighthouse purposes. The tower was moved to this site in 1919. In 1923 the Black's Island reservation was sold. There were no buildings on the island at the time. The light is now in a white, square skeleton tower, enclosing a stair cylinder, with the lantern above ground and above water. The 800,000 candela 3-foot 2-order electric light flashes white every 20 seconds and is visible 16 miles (26 km or 30 km). A radiobeacon was established at the station in 1939. As of June 2012, the light has been added to the lighthouse Doomsday List. As of 2014, the lighthouse has been relocated to Port St. Joe, Florida.

Its parent company is Hirobo Limited. The company was founded October, 1949 as textile machine manufacturer Hiroshima Spinner, Limited. In 1957, the company partnered with Nichibo Company to form Hiroshima Synthetic Fiber Spinners Limited, today known as Unitika Limited. The name change to Hirobo Limited came about in 1970; the electronics division was established in April, 1973. Production of radio controlled models began in July that same year. By October, 1977, the company had completely withdrawn from the textile market. In 1983, Hirobo attempted to put their expertise in helicopters to use in the production of 1/10-scale, four-wheel-drive offroad buggies. Beginning with their innovative 44b off-road car, which was the first to feature a four wheel drive system. The results were the technologically advanced Alien Mid4, Jealousy and Invader, and not forgetting the Ashura, the only belt-drive 4wd 1/12 circuit car ever produced. All featured a 4x4 system operated via a Gilmer belt, an innovation nearly unheard of at the time; most 4x4 cars of the period used a noisy, power-robbing metal chain to transfer power to the front wheels. Despite their advances, Hirobo cars were very expensive and therefore limited their exposure to racers. They were also often plagued with poor build qualities and the use of cheap materials, the other factor of their failing are, distribution in the important North American market was weak as well, all that leading to Hirobo's withdrawal from the RC car market. Hirobo continues to be a leader in helicopters of all price ranges, including coaxial-bladed indoor Sky Robo helicopters in both radio controlled and tethered configurations.

It is the sixteenth installment in the popular Kamen Rider Series of tokusatsu programs. It is a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei. The series was broadcast on TV Asahi. The first episode aired on January 29, 2006, and with the final episode airing on January 21, 2007, completing the series with 49 episodes. The series represents the 35th anniversary of the Kamen Rider Series, as indicated by a notice at the beginning of the pilot episode reading, in Japanese, \\"Kamen Rider 35th Anniversary Production.\\" Kamen Rider Kabuto is the first Kamen Rider Series to be broadcast in a high-definition format. Story Seven years prior to the series, a meteorite struck the Shibuya district in Tokyo. An alien lifeform, known as the Worms, emerged from the meteorite and became a threat to humanity. Souji Tendou has been trained for seven years while waiting for the Kabuto Zecter so that he may properly take up the mantle of Kamen Rider Kabuto. Making many enemies while at the same time meeting other Riders with mysterious origins, Tendou attempts to accomplish his goal at all costs: to destroy all Worms that threaten humanity. He meets ZECT operative Arata Kagami, who later becomes Kamen Rider Gatack. The two soon work together to save humanity from the alien Worms‚Äîbut not before uncovering the conspiracies within the ZECT organization and the \\"Natives\\" species. Masked Rider System , also known as the , are a compilation of mobile systems that affect space/time. They were created by the Natives, a species of Worm that arrived on Earth 35 years ago. These Natives in turn gave the Zecters to humans so that they may protect them from alien Worms that would arrive later. The Zecters appear instantaneously from the ZECT headquarters to the selected personnel so that they may transform into the respective Rider to fight any Worms in the vicinity. Each Rider (except for the Hopper Riders and the Kabutech Riders) possesses two forms: the bulky armored cocoon-like and the sleeker which can use the , a system that allows the Rider to move at high speed. They also have the ZECTroopers to help them. Worth noting is that the Zecters have a mind of their own and can reject their present user in search of another one if they so choose. There are eight known Zecters within the Masked Rider System, each allowing the user to become a different Rider. Most Zecters are based on insects, with the exception of the Sasword Zecter, which is based on a scorpion. *Kamen Rider Kabuto *Kamen Rider TheBee *Kamen Rider Drake *Kamen Rider Sasword *Kamen Rider Gatack *Kamen Rider KickHopper *Kamen Rider PunchHopper *Kamen Rider Dark Kabuto There also exist two other Zecters known as the Perfect Zecter and the Hyper Zecter. The Perfect Zecter serves as a primary weapon while the Hyper Zecter is a power-up device that enhances the powers of the original Zecter. Both were only used by Kabuto in the series, but Gatack got to use the Hyper Zecter in the Hyper Battle DVD. Allusions The series made some allusions to the whole Kamen Rider series. Masked Rider Project as mentioned in the course of the series was said to have started on 3 April 1971. The Worm species known as Natives also first arrived on Earth on the same year. In real-life, it was the date the first Kamen Rider show aired for the first time. Episodes God Speed Love The movie spin-off of the 2006 Kamen Rider Series, entitled , was released in Japan on August 5. The film took place in an alternate timeline and served as an alternate prologue to the series, featuring three new Riders known as Hercus, Ketaros and Caucasus. Hyper Battle Video In , Arata Kagami seeks to get the Hyper Zecter just like Souji Tendou, so he tries to emulate Tendou. Once he realizes that he has to be himself, the Hyper Zecter appears and allows him to transform into Kamen Rider Gatack Hyper Form, which only appears in the DVD. The Kabuto and Gatack Zecters speak to Tendou and Kagami throughout the DVD, voiced by Tomokazu Seki and K≈çji Yusa, respectively. Video game A video game based on the series was produced by Bandai for the PlayStation 2, under the name Kamen Rider Kabuto.

These look backs are held in a movie theater and the segment is hosted by Soji Tendo (Kamen Rider Kabuto), Arata Kagami (Kamen Rider Gatack), Tetsuki Yamato (Kamen Rider Ketaros), Yuzuki Misaki, and Masato Mishima. During these five segments, they discuss the history of the Kamen Rider franchise, sometimes in a comedic tone, but always with serious background music. *Episode 23 (Rider Kicks): The group watches and Yamato narrates the variations of Rider Kicks during the course of the years. Yamato mentions the Rider Double Kick of Kamen Riders 1 and 2, Kamen Rider V3's V3 Kick, Kamen Rider X's X Kick, and Kamen Rider Super-1's ten kicks. In the end, Kagami stands up and does his own Rider Kick (he even shouts the attack name) and falling into his seat with Yuzuki looking. Tendo asks Yamato, \\"Who are you?\\" *Episode 24 (Criminal Organizations): The group watches and learns about the different criminal organizations the Kamen Riders had to fight. Villains include Shocker & Gel- Shocker in the first Kamen Rider, Destron from Kamen Rider V3, and King Dark (of the Government of Darkness) in Kamen Rider X. Footage of Black Satan, the first enemy of Kamen Rider Stronger, is also shown. Tendo then supposes that it is the Kamen Rider's destiny to fight an organization. Mishima tells Tendo that ZECT will show no mercy to anyone who fights them. Yamato then says that he will definitely smash Neo-ZECT for rebelling against and splitting off from ZECT. *Episode 25 (Rhinoceros Beetle-Themed Kamen Riders): The group watches Kamen Rider Stronger, and Kagami quickly thinks that Stronger himself is Kabuto, then looks at Tendo confused. Misaki corrects him, informing him that this is a different Rider, using the rhinoceros beetle as a design. Mishima then announces that it is Kamen Rider Stronger. The camera then zooms on Tendo's face as he says that while this Rider may be Stronger, he (referring to himself) is the strongest. Tendo pronounces \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Strongest\\" in English, (due to the fact that Hiro Mizushima, who portrays Tendou, is fluent in English). Yamato then also speaks of the Kabutech Riders (Caucasus [Caucasus beetle], Heracus [Hercules beetle], and Ketaros [centaurus beetle], the last of whom Yamato happens to be), which are also Rhinoceros Beetle Riders (as the Caucasus, Hercules, and Centaurus beetles are rhinoceros beetle sub-species). Also, despite being a Rhinoceros Beetle Rider, Kamen Rider Blade (also a Hercules beetle) was omitted. At the end, Tendo stands up and miniature hexagons with Tendo's face appear, forming a compound eye pattern as Tendo says once again that he is \\"the man who walks the path of heaven that will rule over everything.\\" *Episode 26 (Riders Everywhere): The group watches Kamen Rider and Yamato comments on Skyrider's Sailing Jump, then says that the Riders can go anywhere around the world. In addition, they are not restricted to the ground. Then, Misaki mentions the Riders can even now go into space. During this segment, they watch footage of Kamen Riders 1 through ZX training with each other in Kamen Rider 1's base on Arizona in the final episodes of Kamen Rider Black RX, followed by footage from God Speed Love. Tendo then coins a variant of his trademark quote (\\"Now, I will truly walk down the path of heaven and rule over all.\\"). *Episode 27 (Kamen Rider Ultimate Forms): Kamen Rider Stronger's upgrade is not mentioned (as it is not an \\"Ultimate Form\\", but rather a temporary power upgrade) and the short starts with Yamato commenting on Black RX and his modes RX Robo Rider and RX Bio Rider. It then moves on to Kamen Rider Kuuga Ultimate Form, Kamen Rider Agito Shining Form, Kamen Rider Ryuki Survive, Kamen Rider Faiz Blaster Form, Kamen Rider Blade King Form, and Kamen Rider Armed Hibiki. Suddenly, Yamato and Tendo are about to duel with the others looking on and shown on screen is Kabuto's Ultimate Form, Hyper Form. Parodies Episode 327-B of Sgt.

An ordinary dropping funnel lacks the pressure-equalizing glass tube at the right side. A dropping funnel is a type of laboratory glassware used to transfer fluids. They are fitted with a stopcock which allows the flow to be controlled. Dropping funnels are useful for adding reagents slowly, i.e. drop-wise. This may be desirable when the quick addition of the reagent may result in side reactions, or if the reaction is too vigorous. Dropping funnels are usually fitted with a ground glass joint which allows the funnel to fit snugly onto, e.g. a round bottom flask. This also means it need not be clamped separately.

He was a native of Oradea, a city in present-day Romania (then Nagyv√°rad, Hungary). Biography Politzer was already a militant by the time of his involvement in the Hungarian insurrection of 1919. At age seventeen, the Hungarian Soviet Republic led by B√©la Kun and he went into exile during the so-called White Terror that preceded the establishment of a right-wing government under the regency of Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy. He settled in Paris in 1921 after meeting Freud and S√°ndor Ferenczi in Vienna. He joined the French Communist Party between 1929 and 1931. At the beginning of the 1930s, the Communist Party founded the Workers University of Paris (l'Universit√© Ouvri√®re de Paris) which lasted until dissolution by German occupation in 1939. During his tenure at the university, Politzer was entrusted with and given charge of a course on dialectical materialism. A disciple of Marx and Lenin, Politzer was very interested in psychology, preaching the concrete aspects of this field, in relation to which he qualified traditional psychology as abstract. He also took a lively interest in nascent Freudian theory and its uses before eventually distancing himself from it. In this same period, he occupied the post of professor of philosophy at Lyc√©e Marcelin Berthelot in Saint-Maur-des- Foss√©s. Mobilized to Paris in 1940, he remained on the side of the French Communist Party secret command. Demobilized in July 1940, he oversaw the edition of a clandestine bulletin. After his comrade and friend Paul Langevin, a physicist of world renown, was arrested in October 1940, Politzer published the first edition of The Free University (L'Universit√© Libre), which told of the imprisonment of scholars and denounced the extortions committed by invading fascists during World War II. He worked with other writers like Jacques Decour, Jacques Solomon or Valentin Feldman. All were executed by the nazis in 1942. In February 1942, Politzer's operations were stopped; he was arrested along with his wife Mai (also a Communist and a Resister) for violating the law banning the Communist Party. He underwent torture, being turned over to the Nazis on 20 March 1942 and undergoing execution by firing squad at their hands on 23 May of that year, just after having secretly published a French academic journal. His wife was transported to Auschwitz, where she died in March 1943. Contribution to philosophy His posthumous work, Elementary Principles of Philosophy (Principes √âl√©mentaires de Philosophie) based on notes taken by his followers, was the first work banned by the fascist military regime established in Turkey in 1980. Quotations :As much as one might say: there are, in the history of philosophy, philosophies without subject and philosophies which exhaust themselves in a debauchery of honest or pharisean artifice, with perfect unawareness of being without substance, one will not discuss more than the dates; as much as one might say: the rebirths of the spirit correspond to the discovery of a new subject and the nuances are then swept away because one poses problems in grander terms; they will congratulate us on the ingeniousness of our designs. But when one will say: forthwith, the problems will be posed in great terms; forthwith, the nuances will be swept away, because we see here the new substance: from here on we will not be more than the simple-minded and ignorant and as part of the bargain, ranters ; And all the good disposition that one could have for our ideas will evaporate, suddenly, from the mere fact that we want to convey the precision that they entail. For that is the law of the situation. The philosophers of philosophy without substance are unaware and the comedy brought to bear on them is that they know from science certain that they have had philosophers unaware of being without substance, and that they are perfectly incapable of diagnosing in themselves the ills that they recognize in others. :Tant qu'on dira: il y a dans l'histoire de la philosophie des philosophies sans mati√®re et des philosophies s'√©puisant dans une d√©bauche d'artifices honn√™tes ou pharisiens, avec l'inconscience parfaite d'√™tre priv√©s de mati√®re, on ne discutera plus que sur les dates; tant qu'on dira : les renaissances de l'esprit correspondent √† la d√©couverte d'une mati√®re nouvelle et les nuances sont alors balay√©es parce qu'on pose les probl√®mes en grands termes, ils nous f√©liciteront de l'ing√©niosit√© de nos vues. Mais quand on dira : il faut que d√®s maintenant les probl√®mes soient pos√©s en grands termes; il faut que d√®s maintenant les nuances soient balay√©es, car voici la mati√®re nouvelle: alors nous ne seront plus que des simplistes et des ignorants et par-dessus le march√©, des √©nergum√®nes. Et toute la bonne disposition qu'on pouvait avoir pour nos id√©es s'√©vaporera, tout de suite, du seul fait que nous voulons leur donner la pr√©cision qu'elles comportent. Car telle est la loi de la situation. Les philosophes de la philosophie sans mati√®re sont inconscients et le comique qui p√®se sur eux c'est qu'ils savent de science certaine qu'il y a eu des philosophes inconscients d'√™tre priv√©s de mati√®re et qu'ils sont parfaitement impuissants √† diagnostiquer chez eux la maladie qu'ils reconnaissent pourtant chez les autres. -drawn from The Mind (L'Esprit), Notebooks (Cahiers), May 1926 Supporters posit that all that was new, upsetting the house of Politzer, has been repudiated, ridiculed; and all of that was not upsetting to the official dominant philosophy has been favored. :And it is necessary to acknowledge that, for the new philosophy, there can not be dualism between certainty and security, since speculations connect those who extol it to those who one calls the enemies of society. And they find themselves therefore, happily, in discord with the state. The new philosophers will have nothing more than mere certainty. Truly, philosophying will become anew a dangerous occupation, as it was in heroic times. The philosophers will anew be the friends of the truth, but by the same turn, enemies of the gods, enemies of the state, and corrupters of youth. Philosophy will, anew, involve a risk. A selection will then take place. The truth will be achieved only by those who love it to the point of daring to transform spiritual ventures into material ones. :Et il faut avouer que, pour la philosophie nouvelle, il ne peut pas y avoir de dualisme entre la certitude et la s√©curit√©, puisque les sp√©culations rattachent ceux qui la pr√©conisent √† ceux qu'on appelle les ennemis de la soci√©t√©. Et se trouvant ainsi, heureusement, en d√©saccord avec l'√âtat, les nouveaux philosophes n'auront plus que la certitude. Philosopher v√©ritablement sera de nouveau une occupation dangereuse comme dans les temps h√©ro√Øques. Les philosophes seront de nouveau amis de la v√©rit√©, mais par l√† m√™me ennemis des dieux, ennemis de l'√âtat et corrupteurs de la jeunesse. La philosophie comportera de nouveau un risque. Une s√©lection se produira donc. Ne viendront √† la v√©rit√© que ceux qui l'aiment au point d'oser transformer les aventures spirituelles en aventures mat√©rielles. -(ibidem) See also * Jacques Solomon * Jacques Decour * Valentin Feldman * Paul Langevin * Charlotte Delbo * List of Holocaust victims Notes # - des √©nergum√®nes, per the translation source Works * Against Bergson and some other writers, Philosophical Writings (Contre Bergson et quelques autres), 1924-1939 * Philosophical Investigations into the Essence of Human Freedom, French translation of Schelling, 1926 * Critique of the Foundations of Psychology (Critique des Fondements de la Psychologie), 1928 * Bergsonism, a Philosophical Hoax (La fin d'une parade philosophique: Le bergsonisme), 1929, under the name of Fran√ßois Arouet * The Great Problems of Nowadays Philosophy (Les Grands Probl√®mes de la Philosophie Contemporaine), 1938 * Philosophy and Myths (La Philosophie et les Mythes), 1939 * Philosophy of the Enlightment and Modern Thought (La Philosophie des Lumi√®res et la Pens√©e moderne), 1939 * What is Rationalism?

Housing the South Dakota State Legislature, it is located in the state capitol of Pierre at 500 East Capitol Avenue. The building houses the offices of most state officials, including the Governor of South Dakota. Construction The building was constructed between 1905 and 1910. The designs for the building were executed by the Minneapolis architectural firm of Bell & Detweiler, who gave the building similar features to the Montana State Capitol in Helena, Montana. The planning and construction cost was almost $1 million. In 1921 plans began for a large addition located on the building's north side. The Capitol Annex was designed by architect Bell's later firm, Bell & Kinports. Construction costs were estimated at $500,000.Engineering News-Record 6 Jan. 1921: 14. Construction drawings were issued in 1931, and the Annex project was completed in 1932. Features Rotunda The floor in the capitol building is made of terrazzo tile. Common lore says the floor was laid by 66 Italian artists. To give these artists a chance to place a mark in the building (without allowing them to actually sign their names to the floor), each is said to have been given a blue stone to place in the floor. Only 55 of these tiles have been found, however. It is thought that the remaining stones may have been placed in locations now covered by walls, doors, or carpeting. 1919 Staircase From the first floor, a marble staircase leads upstairs. In front of the staircase, display cases house the First Lady Gown Collection. Miniature replicas have been made of the gown worn by each first lady to the state inaugural ball. These replicas are worn by dolls in the display case. Along with the doll, a picture of each governor's family and other mementos are also displayed. On the second floor, the marble staircase leads into a rotunda. The dome of the rotunda is 96 feet high. The bottom ring is designed to resemble a string of ribbons joined together, which is meant to symbolize the eternal nature of government. The interior of the dome is decorated with sixteen images of the Tree of Life. The dome also displays acanthus leaves to represent wisdom and a pasque flower, which is the state flower. The third floor houses the state's House of Representatives and the state's Senate. The galleries for both, from which the public can observe the legislative process, are located on the fourth floor. Exterior memorials The Fighting Stallions Memorial Four memorials are on the grounds of the capitol building. The Fighting Stallions Memorial is a sculpture built to honor the eight South Dakota residents, including Governor George S. Mickelson, who died in an airplane crash on April 19, 1993. The Flaming Fountain Memorial is a fountain with a perpetually burning natural gas flame. It was installed to honor South Dakotan veterans. The Law Enforcement Officer Memorial pays tribute to police officers who have died in the line of duty. Six bronze figures on a peninsula in the Capitol Lake comprise the World War II Memorial; each represents one of the branches of service in which South Dakota residents served during World War II. Renovation In anticipation of South Dakota's state centennial during 1989, the building was renovated extensively and restored during the administrations of Governors Richard F. Kneip, Harvey L. Wollman, Bill Janklow, and George S. Mickelson. The renovation required 22 years and restored much of the building and its decoration, including the tile floor, to its original appearance. The tiled floor was also repaired; each of the tile workers who did the repairs is said to have been given a heart-shaped stone with which to mark the new floor, as the original workers had. A copy of this article can be found at Work began in 2013 to restore stained glass throughout the building with the $2.7 million project concluded in time for South Dakota's 125th Anniversary celebrations October 1.

He is best known for his experiments involving a 30-year-old patient named Mary Rafferty. Rafferty was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital in 1874 with a 2-inch-diameter (51 mm) hole in her skull caused by a cancerous ulcer. Bartholow experimented with applying current to Rafferty's exposed dura using needle electrodes. His report detailed the first observations of how electrical stimulation of the brain affects motor functions of the body, but many ethical concerns were raised about the way in which he carried out his experiments.  Education and career  Roberts Bartholow was born in New Windsor, Maryland. He attended Calvert College in his hometown, and graduated in 1848 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He earned his degree in medicine from the University of Maryland in 1852. After graduating, he worked in Baltimore's clinics and hospitals before enlisting in the army in 1857. During the Civil War, Bartholow was sent to Fort Union in New Mexico, and a series of other Union military posts in the West from 1861 to 1864. During this time, he worked as assistant surgeon and headed several military hospitals. He also published several papers including A Manual of Instructions for Enlisting and Discharging Soldiers, which was adopted at military recruiting stations to identify disqualifying diseases in recruits. He married Maria Walker in 1862 and before the war's end, he left the army and moved with his family to Cincinnati, Ohio. After his work in the army, Bartholow worked at the Medical College of Ohio where he performed research and was able to publish On Spermatorrhoea in 1866 which detailed complications with the male reproductive system. He also published The Principles and Practice of Disinfection in 1867 and two years later published A Manual of Hypodermic Medication. The latter work was fundamental in guiding physicians through the process of administering medications via syringe. While in Cincinnati, Bartholow worked as a physician in several hospitals with rivaling medical systems. Bartholow worked with practitioners of allopathic, homeopathic, and eclectic medicine, and he used ideas from each in his research. He worked at the Good Samaritan Hospital starting in 1866. He also created his own practice, which grew to be the largest in the city. From 1864 to 1879 he was a professor at the Medical College of Ohio in Cincinnati, and he accepted the position of chair of materia medica in 1869. Following his publication of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Bartholow accepted a professorship at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1879.  Research methods  Bartholow's research often used live animals, which caused backlash from advocates of anti- vivisectionism. He argued that medical practice should be advanced beyond simply observing and comparing different patients' cases. In his view, performing experiments on live animals helps uncover basic biological mechanisms, which provides insight into what treatments are effective. He studied the effects of new drugs on animals in own his experiments, and for his later experiments on Mary Rafferty, he took inspiration from David Ferrier's experiments involving localized electrical stimulation of the brains of live dogs, cats and other non-primates. Challenges to medical research Bartholow was also a pioneer in the field of scientific research in that unlike other researchers of his time who relied on empiricism as a standard route of attaining data and results from experimentation, Bartholow relied on an approach the stressed the importance of fundamental sciences. The method was called the ‚Äúphysiological method‚Äù and promoted the idea of applying medicine and research as a therapeutic method as opposed to a purely scientific endeavor. Through Barthlow's work, research became intertwined with clinical medical practice which set the stage for later medical discoveries in the modern era. Leadership in medicine Bartholow was not only an avid researcher and practitioner, but also taught students and held many leadership roles. In 1869 he became the chair of ‚ÄúProfessor of Materia Medica an Therapeutics and of Clinical Medicine‚Äù at the Good Samaritan Hospital. Later, he also became the ‚ÄúProfessor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine‚Äù. Bartholow also maintained a close relationship with the American Neurological Association since its founding and was appointed president in 1881. Major works Bartholow's major work was in the field of neurology in which he studied to excitability of the brain through the use of electrodes. He worked to understand and localize sections of the brain responsible for certain motor actions. It is still uncertain who was the first to stimulate the brain with electrodes although some historians attribute this feat to Bartholow. Bartholow performed varied experiments on animal models One of his major works regarding the stimulation of the human brain using electrodes was published in 1874 titled Experimental investigations into the functions of the human brain. It detailed the medical story of a patient names Marta Rafferty who presented with a deleterious epithelioma. She consented to having Bartholow stimulate her brain using micro-currents. This experiment confirmed the previous findings of scientists like Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig although applied the medical knowledge to human subjects from initial findings in lower order mammals. Although his findings are considered by many to be the basis of neurology research, Bartholow faced much criticism for using Marta Rafferty as a test subject and invading the ‚Äúsacred organ‚Äù. His work was and still is contested by bioethicists of the American Medical Association.  Experiments on Mary Rafferty  Prior to the experiments, Bartholow studied the effects of electrotherapy, and used electricity in his practice at Good Samaritan Hospital for polyps, tumors, aneurysms and peripheral paralyses. These treatments used either faradic (alternating) and galvanic (direct) current, and Bartholow's main goal was to test the effects of each when applied to the human cortex. Some subgoals included comparing bodily reactions to stimuli on the left and right sides of the brain, and verifying if Ferrier's findings could be generalized to the human brain. Bartholow recorded the patient's blood pressure, arterial tension, and body temperature during the experiments to determine how safe the procedure was, and possibly study function specialization and locate cerebral embolisms. Using a pair of electrolytic needles inserted into the dura and underlying tissues, Bartholow applied a small electric current to different sections of Rafferty's exposed brain and noticed that this caused movements in corresponding parts of her body. The low electric current he applied to the brain did not seem to cause her any pain. However, when Bartholow applied a larger amount of current, Rafferty became distressed, experienced convulsions and went into a coma. She revived from the coma three days later, but the following day she had a major seizure and died. After her death, Bartholow examined the needle wounds by cutting her brain into sections. The tracks of the wounds were filled with liquified cerebral matter, suggesting that the wounds caused a glial scar to form. He described the experiment as follows: Bartholow published his findings in his paper \\"Experimental Investigations into the Functions of the Human Brain\\" in April 1874. The paper was favorably reviewed by Ferrier, who found Bartholow's observations \\"quite in accordance\\" with the results of his own experiments when applying current to the brains of monkeys. Opponents noted that it was impossible to verify that the applied current was localized to specific sections of Rafferty's brain. Though Bartholow claimed that he received consent from Rafferty, critics pointed out that Bartholow himself described Rafferty as \\"feeble-minded\\", which cast doubt on her ability to understand the proposed experiments. It was also known that Rafferty had sustained injuries to her brain from her ulcer, as well as from surgical incisions made to remove pus from her skull. He was also heavily criticized for carrying out the experiments with no intention of healing the patient, and for proceeding without administering anesthesia until after Rafferty experienced several seizures and was nearly unconscious. Bartholow maintained that his actions were not the ultimate cause of Rafferty's death, though he did admit that he had caused some injury. Although he was censured by the American Medical Association following the experiments, his career did not suffer. Bartholow continued to publish books and articles, and his practice remained highly popular. In 1893 he attained the title of Professor Emeritus at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. In the aftermath of the controversy, the American Medical Association banned any human experimentation that disregards saving the life of the patient. The anti-vivisectionist movement in Great Britain cited Bartholow's unethical treatment to successfully lobby bills restricting experiments on animals. He died at his home in Philadelphia in 1904.

Phap Hoa Temple (Vietnamese: Ch√πa Ph√°p Hoa, ), meaning Dharma Lotus Temple, is a Buddhist temple located at 20 Butler Avenue, Pennington, South Australia, 5013. Established in 1978, it moved to its current location in December 1989. It is a member of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation and the head is the Most Venerable Thich Nhu Hue, and the abbot is the Reverend Thich Vien Tri. History Phap Hoa Temple was established in 1978 at a small house located at 83 Addison Road, Rosewater, South Australia by a group of Vietnamese immigrants, led by Nguyen Van Tuoi for the purpose of attending to the spiritual needs of immigrant Vietnamese Buddhists. The Most Venerable Thich Nhu Hue was invited to come from Japan to direct the temple. Due to the small size, a search for a plot of larger land to construct a temple was undertaken, and building of the temple in its current location began on a 5000 m¬≤ plot on 19 March 1984. The main hall of the temple was opened on 23 December 1989. On 26 June 2003 the main hall suffered extensive damage, when an intruder irreparably vandalized the majority of the statues and decorations. This required the replacement of a large number of statues. Along with a new statue of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva located in the courtyard of the Temple, and a Three Entrance Fence, the refurbished hall was unveiled in a ceremony on 27 June 2004 in the presence of South Australian Premier Mike Rann and the Opposition leader Rob Kerin.

The story first appeared in the February 1958 issue of If: Worlds of Science Fiction, and was reprinted in the 1959 collection Nine Tomorrows, the 1969 retrospective Opus 100, and the 1986 collection Robot Dreams. In the introduction to Robot Visions, Asimov lists this story as one of the notable robot stories. The story is representative of genre of sci-fi started at the 50s as reaction to computers around the theme of caution against human mental atrophy in the computers era, like Arthur Clarke's \\"Into the Comet' of 1960. Plot summary In the distant future, humans live in a computer-aided society and have forgotten the fundamentals of mathematics, including even the rudimentary skill of counting. The Terrestrial Federation is at war with Deneb, and the war is conducted by long-range weapons controlled by computers which are expensive and hard to replace. Myron Aub, a low grade Technician, discovers how to reverse-engineer the principles of pencil-and-paper arithmetic by studying the workings of ancient computers which were programmed by human beings, before bootstrapping became the norm‚Äîa development which is later dubbed \\"Graphitics\\". The discovery is appropriated by the military establishment, who use it to re-invent their understanding of mathematics. They also plan to replace their computer-operated ships with lower cost, more expendable (in their opinion) manned ships to continue the war. Aub is so upset by the appropriation of his discovery for military purposes that he commits suicide. As Aub's funeral proceeds, his supervisor realizes that even with Aub dead, the advancement of Graphitics is unstoppable. He executes simple multiplications in his mind without help from any machine, which gives him a great feeling of power.

Speidel is also credited with being one of the leaders of the movement to preserve and restore Pioneer Square, one of Seattle's oldest neighborhoods. By the 1960s, this area was run down and in disrepair, in danger of being demolished and rebuilt. Through the efforts of many people, Pioneer Square is once again a bustling center of activity and tourism with dozens of original buildings that have been restored to their original luster. In 1964, Speidel received and printed a letter from a reader asking about the underground areas of Pioneer Square. He replied via the paper that he did not know much about it, but that he would research it and get back to her. Once he did the research, he printed a response telling her to meet him at 3 p.m. the next Saturday in Pioneer Square, and he would take her on a tour of the underground and what he had found. The reader did show up, along with 500 other people. Speidel quickly took up a collection of $1 from each of the visitors and proceeded on the first tour of the Seattle Underground. Since Memorial Day weekend 1965, the Underground Tour has given several tours a day every day except holidays and is one of the city's best known tourist attractions.

It later became the Mexican Socialist Party () in 1988.

Before merging to form the PSUM, these four parties had formed an electoral alliance called the Coalition of the Left () in 1977. Though the PSUM was a multi-tendency organization, it generally followed the ideology of Eurocommunism. In 1988, the PSUM changed its name to the Mexican Socialist Party (, PMS) after the merging with Mexican Workers' Party. In 1989, following the presidential campaign of Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas, the PMS joined C√°rdenas and other dissidents from the Institutional Revolutionary Party to form the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).

The coat of arms had elements to represent all three territories which comprised the Federation: the rising sun on a blue field in the upper shield and leopard were taken from the arms of Nyasaland; the white wavy lines on a black field at the base of the shield and the eagle are from the arms of Northern Rhodesia; while the dovetail fesse (which links the component parts of the shield), bearing the lion passant, and the sable antelope supporter are from the arms of Southern Rhodesia.
