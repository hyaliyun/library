Taiwanese pro-independence supporters placed the sticker on the front cover of Taiwan passports to re- brand the country's official name from \\"‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúã\\" and \\"Republic of China\\" to the fictional name \\"Âè∞ÁÅ£Âúã\\" (lit. State of Taiwan) and \\"Republic of Taiwan\\" (ROT). The country's national emblem, which is nearly identical to the emblem of Kuomintang, can also be replaced by the cartoons of images unique to Taiwan, including Jade Mountain, the island‚Äôs highest mountain; Formosan black bear; and pro-democracy activist Cheng Nan-jung. The designer, Denis Chen, said that his goal was \\"to highlight the absurdity of 'the Republic of China' and the need of founding a new country through changing the passport covers\\". Pro- independence Taiwanese applauded these stickers. Some commented on social media that they had experienced prolonged customs process abroad because officers confused the Republic of China with the People‚Äôs Republic of China. Controversies in other countries Despite the claim by users on the internet that the re-branded passport was accepted by 27 countries for entry (including the People's Republic of China), the sticker soon caused its holders to be deported from a number of countries and regions, while some other countries forced the holders of such passports to remove their stickers. It is worth noting that alteration of passports, including its covers, may be a criminal offense in some countries. Singapore was the first country in Asia to deny entry to holders of such passports on 29 November 2015, and deported three ROC nationals for \\"altering their travel documents\\".„ÄåÂè∞ÁÅ£Âúã„ÄçË≤ºÁ¥ôÈÅ≠ÊòüÂúãÊãíÁµïÂÖ•Â¢É Á∂≤ÂèãÔºöÊÑõË≤ºÂ∞±Ë¶ÅË≤†Ëµ∑Ë≤¨‰ªª Among the three, two immediately removed the ROT stickers upon the further inquiries by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers, but were eventually deported by Singapore to Taiwan.

She defined the standards for Organic Farmed Salmon, and introduced quality assurance labelling for farmed salmon. Education Lindsay Laird was educated at Worcester Grammar School for girls and at Newnham College, Cambridge where she not only read Natural Science (Zoology) but also played squash for Cambridge, gaining a half-blue. During her time at Cambridge a brown hairy moth from Borneo (Dasychira lairdi) was named after her. After graduation in 1971, an Atlantic Salmon Trust scholarship took her to Sutherland in the far north of Scotland to study the wild salmon of the River Brora,Laird L.M. (1972). The River Brora. Salmon and Trout Magazine 143-148. which was followed by Ph.D. studies on salmon and trout in North Wales under the supervision of Dr Jack JonesJones J.W. (1959). The Salmon. Collins (New Naturalist Library), London. of Liverpool University. Her work on salmon continued at Liverpool University where she obtained her Ph.D.in 1974 with her thesis Growth and Movements of Juvenile Atlantic Salmon & Brown Trout in AfonMynach. Career Laird began her career in 1975 at the University of Stirling Aquatic Pathobiology Unit, on a Shell Fellowship. She also published key papers on basic techniques now considered routine: freeze branding of juvenile salmon, and benzocaine as a fish anaesthetic. The following year she obtained Nuffield Foundation funding for a project at Aberdeen University on methods of inducing auto-immune rejection of fish gonads. She applied her fundamental knowledge of life cycles of salmon to the developing aquaculture industry in Scotland and Norway which at that time was struggling with problems of control of sexual maturation in salmon. She conducted in Norway the first experiments on autoimmune sterilization of salmon by injection.Laird L.M., Wilson, A.R. & Holliday, F.G.T. (1980). Field trials of a method of induction of autoimmune gonad rejection in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) Reprod. Nutr. Develop., 20, 1761-1788. She foresaw the need to control of the life cycle of salmon in captivity in order to make production more predictable and also more profitable. After she defined the standards for Organic Farmed Salmon (together with K. McCallum of Orkney Salmon), her concept of a green label for farmed salmon to provide quality assurance for customers was taken up by firms such as Marks & Spencer. In 1988 she became a Teaching fellow and Aquaculture Development Officer at the University of Aberdeen, where she developed the Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) in Aquaculture, jointly run with the Scottish Agricultural College. She joined the Scottish Fisheries Committee the next year, monitoring effects of the electricity industry on salmon and other fisheries, and was also invited by Shetland Salmon Farming Association to advise on the Braer oil pollution spill. She was invited to join the Scottish Salmon Strategy Task Force in 1995, and in 1998 became Vice- President of the Scottish Executive Fisheries Committee. Beyond Scotland, from 1992 she was involved in EU education and training programmes FORCE, COMETT, ERASMUS and LEONARDO. Between 1992 and 1997 she spent periods of time at the Danum Valley Research Centre, Sabah, funded by the Royal Society and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), and on aquaculture and fisheries projects in Sarawak, Philippines, Taiwan and Singapore. In 1994 she worked in the Kola Peninsula, Russia, journeying across the tundra near Murmansk in Russian ex-military helicopters to report on salmon fishing for the British Council. In 1997 she was UK delegate on the EU ALFA project, visiting fish farms in Chile. Lindsay Laird died from cancer in 2001.

Biography  =Early life= Pedrosa was born in Poitiers from a family of Portuguese descent; his grandfather immigrated to France in the 1930s. He wanted to become a drawing artist since his adolescence, studying animation at Gobelins school, then working from 1996 to 1998 at Walt Disney Animation France, as an inbetweener in The Hunchback of Notre Dame and as assistant animator in Hercules. = Career = After meeting with David Chauvel, Pedrosa debuted into comics in 1998 with Ring Circus, for which he did art and coloring. A second title followed, Les Aventures spatio- temporelles de Shaolin Moussaka. In 2006, Pedrosa created his first solo work, the one-shot Les C≈ìurs solitaires (Hearts at Sea), followed by a second one, Trois ombres (Three Shadows) in 2007. The album won the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival Essentials award in 2008 and the National Cartoonists Society Division Award in 2009. He collaborated with the fanzine Le Goinfre and participated, with Cassinelli and Holb√©, of the webcomic Cadavres Exquisis from 2004 to 2007. From 2008 to 2009, Pedrosa drew Autobio for Fluide Glacial, a fictionalized ecological-themed autobiography. The comic won the Prix Tournesol (Sunflower Award) in 2009, given by The Greens. In 2012 he published the semi-autobiographical graphic novel Portugal, about a cartoonist exploring his family roots. In 2013, he founded, alongside Gwen de Bonneval, Herv√© Tanquerelle, Br√ºno and Fabien Vehlmann, the digital comics magazine Professeur Cyclope.

Origin By the end of the 1920s the FS were considering the possibility of building a new class of Pacific locomotives for mainline express duties; the existing Class 690 ones were poor steamers (because of the small firebox) and therefore not being successful (with the much lighter Class S.685 2-6-2 locomotives having the same performance as them). This class, which should have been the Class 695, would have had however a very high axle load (as much as 21 t), which would have required strengthening of the lines they were supposed to serve; as electrification was becoming more and more prominent, such an expense was considered unwarranted. Therefore, a less ambitious plan, which involved rebuilding the Class 690 locomotives (and which would have entailed a lower axle load), was approved. The boiler of the Class 690 was replaced by the one fitted on the Class 746 locomotives; the trailing axle was replaced by a Bissel truck, to sustain the weight of the new, larger firebox, and a Nielebock-Knorr pre-heater was added. The 33 locomotives were rebuilt, part by the FS workshops, and part by the Ernesto Breda company. Initially they would have received the same tender designed for the Class 695, but in the end an enlarged version of the standard FS bogie tender was fitted. Operation The Class 691 served on the Milan-Bologna (up to 1938, when the line was electrified) and the Milan-Venice mainlines throughout their careers, pulling the heaviest and fastest express trains. Three of them were destroyed or irreparably damaged in the years of World War II. After the electrification of the Milan-Venice railway in the spring of 1957, some locomotives remained active for some time on the Venice-Cervignano del Friuli line, but by the early 1960s they were all withdrawn. The 691.011 scored the speed record, between the stations of Verona and Padova, for the Italian steam locomotives, with . Modifications In 1939 the 691.026 was given a streamlined casing, which was unsuccessful; by 1946 the casing had already been removed. In 1943 the 691.004 was fitted with a smoke deflector with bad results. Preservation Only one locomotive of the class survived into preservation, the 691.022, which is a static exhibit at the Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\" in Milan.

Animal studies  According to a study conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, RAD 140 appears to be safer than testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in rats. Further research is required to determine if RAD 140 is also safer than TRT in human subjects. Another study conducted in February 2011 found that RAD 140 (Testolone) slightly increased lean muscle mass when used in primate subjects, by targeting androgen receptors in skeletal tissue. These measured increases in lean muscle mass were not statistically significant, however, this may be due to the small group sizes (n = 3) and relatively large standard deviations.

His main research interests are developing a unified theory of the causes of crime (Situational Action Theory), testing it empirically and applying it to devising knowledge-based prevention policies. His work is internationally acknowledged, as demonstrated by his election as a Fellow of the American Society of Criminology in 2010 and a Fellow of the British Academy in 2011. Career Research and teaching: Wikstr√∂m held teaching and research posts in the Department of Criminology at the University of Stockholm from 1979-1990, where he served as Deputy Head of Department from 1987-1990. During this time he was also a senior research officer for the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (1985-1990), and became the Director of the Research Department from 1990-1994. He returned to the University of Stockholm as Adjunct Professor of the Sociology of Crime from 1993-1996, during which time he also worked as a Principal Research Fellow in the Swedish National Policing College's Research Unit (1995-1996). In 1997 he moved to the University of Cambridge becoming Professor of Ecological and Developmental Criminology in 2001. Professional affiliations: Wikstr√∂m has been a Board Member of the Scandinavian Research Council for Criminology (1992‚Äì1997), the Scientific Commission of the International Society for Criminology (1995‚Äì1999), and the European Society of Criminology (2000‚Äì2001 and 2004‚Äì2005). Main fellowships and awards: Wikstr√∂m received the University of Edinburgh Northern Scholars Award in 1991, and the Sellin-Glueck Award from the American Society of Criminology in 1994. He was awarded a Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science at Stanford University in 2002, and was elected as a Fellow of the American Society of Criminology in 2010, and the British Academy in 2011. In 2016, Wikstr√∂m received the prestigious Stockholm Prize in Criminology for outstanding achievements in criminological research. In 2017 he was appointed Doctor Honoris Causa by the UNED (Spain) in recognition of his 'long academic career and extraordinary scientific contributions'.  Biography  Wikstr√∂m's contributions to the field of criminology include the development of original theory to tackle the causes of crime, the design of innovative research methods to study the social ecology of crime (increasingly recognized as an important but under-researched area in criminology), and the publication of groundbreaking new findings about the role of social contexts in acts of crime which he is currently developing into recommendations for policy and practice. Early in his career, Wikstr√∂m made significant scholarly contribution to the study of criminal careers,Patterns of crime in a birth cohort, 1987; Age and crime in a Stockholm cohort, 1990 the social ecology of crime,Urban crime, criminals, and victims, 1991 the etiology of violence,Everyday violence in contemporary Sweden, 1985 and cross-national comparisonsWith David Farrington: Criminal careers in London and Stockholm: A cross-national comparative study, 1993 ‚Äì accomplishments which earned him the American Society of Criminology's Thorsten Sellin and Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck Award in 1994 and a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in 2002. In recent years, Wikstr√∂m has focused his energies on advancing multidisciplinary theory into the explanation of crime through Situational Action Theory (SAT).Individuals, settings and acts of crime: Situational mechanisms and the explanation of crime, 2006; The social origins of pathways in crime: Towards a developmental ecological action theory of crime involvement and its changes, 2005; The social ecology of crime: The role of the environment in crime causation, 2007; Explaining crime as moral action, 2010; Towards an analytical criminology, 2014; Why crime happens, 2014 SAT represents one of the first attempts in the field of criminology to specify the situational mechanisms that link individual differences and behavioural contexts to specific acts of crime. At the core of SAT is the proposition that crime, which represents a form of moral rule-breaking (moral rules being rules, such as laws, that specify what it is right or wrong to do), is the outcome of an interaction between people with relevant personal characteristics (crime propensities ‚Äì weak crime-relevant personal morality and a poor ability to exercise self-control) and settings with relevant (criminogenic) features (a weak moral context and poor enforcement). This interaction may lead certain people in certain settings to perceive crime as an action alternative (something they would consider doing), which they then choose to commit. SAT frames this situational perception-choice process against the backdrop of developmental processes which lead people and places to acquire crime-relevant characteristics, and selection processes which bring certain kinds of people and places together in space and time. In a field where many prominent observers have highlighted the serious problems caused by theoretical fragmentation, the importance of this endeavor cannot be underestimated. SAT has gone head to head with other contemporary theories and established its unique contributions to the explanation of crime, including its clear and testable implications, its integration of individual and environmental levels of explanation, and its attention to crime as a form of moral rule-breaking. To test this theory, Wikstr√∂m has designed and implemented an ambitious, multilevel longitudinal study investigating key personal dimensions of young people; key social, environmental, spatial and temporal features of their activity fields; and their crime involvement; and how these change across adolescence and into adulthood. The Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study (PADS+; see www.pads.ac.uk) is one of the largest and most successful longitudinal studies of crime ever undertaken in the UK, and the only one to empirically test cross-level interactions in the explanation of crime. PADS+ combines existing methodologies with innovative techniques designed to measure social environments and participants‚Äô exposure to those environments, at a level of detail rarely attempted longitudinally across such a large sample. In particular, Wikstr√∂m pioneered a new method of combining space-time budgets with small area ecometrics to study exposure to different social contexts and its relevance for crime involvement.Examining the role of the environment in crime causation: Small area community surveys and space-time budgets, 2011 This technique is now being replicated in studies around the world. Independent tests of SAT are also appearing and providing additional support for the theory. Findings from these studies and PADS+ highlight the role of the social environment and the interaction between people and environments in young people's crime involvement.Crime propensity, criminogenic exposure and crime involvement in early to mid adolescence, 2009; Activity fields and the dynamics of crime, 2010; and in particular Breaking rules: The social and situational dynamics of young people‚Äôs urban crime, 2012 The book Breaking Rules provides a comprehensive overview of the rigorous study design, crime involvement and key relevant personal and social factors in a contemporary adolescent sample, and, for the first time ever in criminology, presents concrete evidence that crime occurs when (and only when) people with specific personal characteristics take part in settings with specific environmental features under specific circumstances. Wikstr√∂m's study and innovative methods allow for the identification of environmental features which make settings criminogenic, and personal characteristics which make some people vulnerable, and others resistant, to those settings. These findings have critical implications for crime prevention.

It is a dense shrub- tree that can grow to high and is a perennial plant meaning it has long life span and doesn‚Äôt necessary produce a high amount of seed. The cabbage-tree wattle heavily flowers from August till October and relies on animals and insects for pollination and dispersal of seeds. This least concern acacia species is found in the western plains of New South Wales and Central Queensland the habitats of these areas are found to be sandy soils and gibber plains ( Desert pavement). Description Acacia cana is one of Australia's native wattles. It grows to about 6m in height and is a dense shrub-tree that is often described as gnarled and deformed in shape. It is a native species that is a perennial that produces 15-35 flowers that are coloured bright yellow to golden, these flowers start to occur in August right through to October. The shrub is found to have 5‚Äì13 cm long branchlets (phyllodes) that are covered in fine silver hairs; leaves are thin with a length of 6 cm and a width of 5mm. While pods are slightly curved but thin with a length of around 10 cm and are covered in fine hairs. Some distinctive traits of Acacia cana is that it has one gland located at the base of the plant, that most of this species is covered in fine small hairs and it bark is grey. Distribution and habitat Acacia cana is found in New South Wales western plains e.g near white cliffs, The Sturt National Park and Merindee. It is also found as far north as central Queensland at Avadale. These areas are woodlands that can be widely scattered that are made up of sandy soils and gibber plains (desert pavement). This acacia species grows in this type of habitat as the it can associates with mugla species (different acacia family), leopardwood (Flindersia maculosa) and belah (Casuarina cristata). Reproduction and dispersal Acacia cana is a perennial plant species that relies on animals and insects to pollinate. This Australian native achieves this by producing bright yellow flowers that occur from August to October each year that fabricate pollen; it is this pollen that acts as a type of reward for the animal or insect. While dispersal of seeds can also be influenced by animals and ants by either eating the seeds or moving seeds to their habitats. However the seeds are not fully dispersed till the seeds is removed from the legume (pods) which occurs from influences by a hot sun or a bushfire. Acacia's overall depend on animals and insects to reproduces and disperse seeds. Uses and bush tucker Acacias seeds, roots and gum are types of aboriginal bush tucker that very nutritious food sources that have unique tastes and provide high levels of protein, carbohydrates and fibre and low levels of fats. Acacia seeds are found to have chocolate like taste and are best known for being an ingredient for making bread while roots were roasted before eating and the gum was collected and eaten as snack or placed in water to make a flavored drink. Acacias were not only used as bush tucker but as wood for certain aboriginal tools for example hunting and fishing spears. Another use of these native shrubs/trees was for some medical treatments of headaches, fevers and colds. Conservation This species has not being assessed by the IUCN's Species Red List, however under the Nature conservation Act (NCA) it is listed as least concern.

He belonged to the \\"Freireligi√∂sen\\" (religious humanist) movement and also championed the use of Shorthand. Before and after 1871 he sat as a member of the German Reichstag. Life =Early years= Wigard was born in Mannheim in the summer of 1807, during the Napoleonic War. His father's occupation is given as court librarian (\\"Sekret√§r hofbibliothek\\"). Between 1826 and 1832 he attended the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where his studies covered Roman Catholic theology, philosophy, jurisprudence and cameralism (Administration sciences). In 1827 he joined the prestigious Corps Palatia Munich (student fraternity).K√∂sener Korps-Listen 1910, 175, 249 He undertook a training in stenography (shorthand) with Franz Xaver Gabelsberger and entered government service. In 1831 he was recorded working as a stenographer in the Bavarian parliament (Landtag). By 1834 he had moved to Saxony and in 1834 was employed as a stenographer in the Saxon parliament in Dresden. In 1834 Franz Jacob Wigard founded the Saxony Stenography Institute at Dresden and in 1843 he was appointed to a professorship in the subject. From 1845 he was also a leading representative of the so-called \\"German Catholics\\" (\\"deutschkatholische Bewegung\\"), a movement of dissenting politically focused Roman Catholics. =Switch to medicine= His political- religious activities during the increasingly fevered period between 1845 and 1848 led to his being relieved of his job as a parliamentary stenographer. He continued to devote himself to political activism, and also returned during the 1850s to student studies, this time undertaking medical studies at the Academy for Medicine and Surgery at Dresden. From 1856 he was working as a physician in Dresden. In 1858 Franz Jacob Wigard obtained his full doctoral qualification at the University of Jena. =Politics= Wigard was prominent as a political activist during the revolutionary period of 1848/49. He was a member of the \\"pre-parliament\\" that met in the Pauluskirche in Frankfurt at the start of April 1848, of the Frankfurt Parliament that followed it and of the ensuing Rump Parliament until its existence was forcibly ended in June 1849.

Later, in 1850 and again in 1869/70 he sat as a member of the Saxony Parliament (\\"S√§chsischer Landtag\\"). From 1867 till 1870 he sat as a member of the short-lived North German Reichstag. Following unification in 1871 this was replaced with a new national Reichstag: he sat as a member of this till 1874, representing the Dresden Old City Reichstag constituency.

Early life  Born in Athens, Greece on 6 November 1937, he was the son of Costas Tseklenis from Pyrgos, Elis regional unit (located in the Peloponnese area of Greece) and Melania Pastirmadji who was born in Constantinople. He grew up and completed his studies in Athens. He attended Athens College and graduated from the Moraitis School. Personal life In 1960 he married Aspa Pesmazoglou and eventually divorced in 1965.

PFF collection) Career =Summary= Yannis Tseklenis is recognised today as the leading Greek fashion designer of the second half of the 20th century who introduced Greek fashion to the contemporary international fashion world. His creations from 1965 to 1991 were sold worldwide by leading stores in more than 30 countries. During the 1960s and 1970s, he drew inspiration from Greek and world cultural styles, which he developed for fashion in his textile patterns. His collections featured designs inspired by ancient Greek vases,Victor Walker, Ode to Grecian urn by a hot Young man, NY Daily News, New York, 26 October 1969 Byzantine manuscripts, traditional Greek wood carvings and paintings; African,Barbara K.Sadtler, Voodoo Drums Sound Fashion Note for Summer, Staten Island Advance, 22 December 1970 Chinese,Chinese Lacquers Collection, Europeana Fashion, Peloponnsian Folklore Foundation Collection Indonesian, Russian,Nancy Mills, It May Be Greek to You, But to Him it's Fashion, Daily News, 15 June 1972 and Spanish art; heraldry;Jules Farber, Greek Designer with Heraldic Look, International Herald Tribune, New York, 10 June 1969 insects;Barbara K.

By the late 1970s and 1980s the Tseklenis brand name could also be found on distinguished lines of house linens, wall and floor tiles, luggage, hosiery, uniforms, as well as the interior designs of cars, aircraft and hotels. His work was praised worldwide by leading fashion editors of the time, such as Bernadine Morris (New York Times),Bernadine Morris, Using 3.000 Yeas of History, New York Times, New York, 1966 Sally Kirkland (Life Magazine), Eugenia Sheppard (International Herald Tribune, Los Angeles Times)Eugenia Sheppard, Yannis Tseklenis:Name to Remember, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, 17 December 1969 and many others. Most recently, he was particularly active in the interior and exterior design and refurbishment of hotels, luxury housing estates, and public transport vehicles. =In detail= 1950s and 1960s At the age of 15 Yannis Tseklenis started working at his father's textile-couture retail business, where he gained valuable experience while also exploring his abilities in painting and design. At age 24 he established his own advertising agency, Spectra Advertising, and undertook the publicity campaigns of major international and Greek companies such as Metaxa, General Motors, and Aegean Mills.Beverly Gilmore, Designer GŒøes Home Again; Is Better Than Ever, Staten Island Advance, 4 December 1980 In 1962 and 1964 respectively, Tseklenis was directly involved in the interior decoration and design relating to the official celebrations of the weddings of princess Sofia of Greece to Juan Carlos of Spain,Jules B. Farber, Tseklenis - Greeks' Word in Fashion, Herald Tribune, 23 August 1968 and of Anne-Marie of Denmark to the then King Constantine II of Greece.Alexander Reymonde, Tseklenis May Become Familiar Name in Fashion, The Atlanta Constitution, 5 December 1974 PFF collection) In 1963 he exhibited his paintings and drawings at the then well-known Athenian gallery Architektoniki (ŒëŒ°ŒßŒôŒ§ŒïŒöŒ§ŒüŒùŒôŒöŒó). In 1965, aged 28, he took over his father's textile business and later that year, in collaboration with the Greek fashion designer Dimis Kritsas, presented his textile designs on fabrics used by Kritsas for his garments. The show was a huge success in Athens and New York. The entire collection, including 5,000 metres of his fabrics, was purchased by Elizabeth Arden Couture of New York. In 1966 he proceeded with the licensing of his prints to the US firm Puritan Fashions Corporation.Pyritan Fashions to Unveil Greek Promotion in '67, Women's Wear Daily, 23 November 1966 Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times that \\"...many of the clothes achieve their distinction from Mr. Tseklenis' prints, which look like modern abstractions but are derived from such ancient sources as a Minoan octopus and a Corinthian vase...\\" This motivated him to set up his own fashion business. By 1967 he already had a chain of fashion boutiques in Greece and by 1968 a small garment manufacturing business in Athens.Enid Nemy, Designer's Penchant: Prints, New York Times, 1968 He then licensed his designs to Berketex in the UK,Irias Walton The Endineer Who Made a Fortune in Fashion, Sunday Mercury, 15 October 1967 American Celanese employed him to design for 10 knitting manufacturers in Germany, and in 1969 he licensed designs to David Crystal Inc. in the US. That year he was the first Greek fashion designer to design a collection of menswear in Greece, to be primarily included in his Tseklenis boutiques and he licensed his hosiery designs to Berkshire Hellas.JGeorge Hamill, The Tseklenis Touch - A Greek Bears Gifts Than Make Summer More Seductive, Esquire Magazine, August 1969 1970s and 1980s During the 1970s Tseklenis became the force behind the organisation of the first fashion collections in Greece, also using his international influence to promote Greek designers abroad.Nina S. Hyde, Greek Prints, The Washington Post, 21 November 1973 In 1970 he licensed his ladies' dresses to Frank Usher (UK) and to Madison S.A (Greece),Victor P. Walker, Bra-Less Look Found in greece, Burbank-Calif.Review, 5 December 1969 while in 1971 he opened Tseklenis Boutiques in Beirut, Kuwait and Riyadh, as well as showrooms in Osaka (Japan) via the firm Misaki Sojhi. Later that same year he was commissioned by Aristotle Onassis to design the air-hostess uniforms for his airline Olympic Airways. In the meantime launched his first collection of furnishing fabrics in Athens, Paris and London. By 1973 Tseklenis had permanent showrooms in London and New York, thus supplying most of the top UK and US fashion stores of the time. By 1976 there were nine Tseklenis Fashion Boutiques in Greece, including in Athens, Mykonos, Hydra and Crete, while he also ran boutique shops on cruise ships and at the Caravel Hotel in Athens.Penny Mandis, Tseklenis: Spring-Summer '74, The Greek Star, 10 January 1974 1977 proved to be a turning point for Tseklenis, both professionally and personally. While suffering an aggressive form of melanoma, he was admitted to the Memorial Hospital in New York, where doctors amputated his left arm to prevent the spread of cancer. Despite this traumatic and life- changing event he moved from Athens to New York, along with his entire business, where he signed up with the International Management Group, who then represented him internationally in the licensing of his fabrics, childrenswear and sportswear. A year later, in 1979, the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the Tseklenis fashion films for their film library. PFF collection) In the meantime, the absence of the Tseklenis firm from Greece became a socio- economic issue for the country. The government therefore offered him favourable terms to return his business to Greece, which he did. He thus established Tseklenis International Fashion Enterprises (ladieswear, menswear, accessories, bodywear, action-sportwear and linens) based in Athens, in collaboration with Minion department stores. Seven boutiques were opened within these stores, and he aimed to start a franchise throughout the country. Unfortunately these plans were abandoned the following year, after the flagship department store burned down due to an arson attack. The Hellenic Ministry of Industry commissioned him to organise and head for two years the Hellenic Design Centre, an institution offering designs by Greek designers to the country's manufacturers, thus encouraging Greek talent. According to Tseklenis, though, the relationship between design and industry in Greece is a loveless one, due to ignorance of branding. Also in 1979 the automobile company Fiat assigned him to design the interiors and a facelift of the FIAT 126 personal car. In 1980 Tseklenis opened a new showroom on New York's Fifth Avenue. The decade found him expanding his business even further and entering into activities such as interior design, bed linen, homewares (ceramics, tableware, candlesticks, etc.), and artistic direction of films. 1990s to present During the 1990s Tseklenis became almost totally active in the interior and environmental design business. In 1997 he donated almost all his prototype garments from his 1970s and 1980s fashion collections to the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation.Tseklenis Collection, Europeana Fashion, Peloponnsian Folklore Foundation Collection The following year he was commissioned to design the exteriors and interiors of Athens' public transport system (i.e. buses, trolleys) and in 1999 designed the then new suburban trains for the Hellenic Railways Organization (OSE). Since 2000, he has been responsible for the holistic interior design of many luxury hotels, resorts and private villas across Greece. Examples of his work include Vedema (one of the first luxury boutique hotels in Greece), Zannos Melathron, Kastelli Resort Santorini, La Maltese Restaurant in Santorini, The Danai Beach Resort & Villas, and several luxury private villas in Athenian suburbs and the islands of Santorini and Mykonos, including the distinguished work on the Kelia vacation housing settlements on the island of Tinos. Awards Tseklenis' artistic contribution to Greece has been awarded with various distinctions. He has received the Silver Cross of the order of Phoenix from the Greek State, the Gold Medal of Fashion from the Hellenic Institute of Fashion, the Maiden of Cyclades by the Hellenic Fashion Centre and the Diolkos Prize of the Hellenic Marketing Academy.

History  Doddle was launched in October 2014, as the joint venture between founder of Network Rail and Travelex, Lloyd Dorfman. Network Rail approached Glazer Business and Brand Consultants, with the task of naming and creating a new brand identity, for a new parcel pick up service primarily within train stations. The brand identity was designed by Richard Lawton and Stuart Palmer, of Glazer. As of January 2020, Doddle no longer operates Doddle branded Morrisons stores collections, though they remain the technology provider, enabling Morrisons to offer ‚Äúclick & collect‚Äù and returns services. Since its foundation, Doddle‚Äôs business model has continued to evolve alongside changing customer preferences, pivoting away from owning stores and concessions towards offering its proprietary technology to retailers, posts and parcel carriers. Doddle launched its technology offering, beginning with a click and collect solution, in January 2017. The business has continued to develop new technology across the fulfilment spectrum, including returns and fulfilment from stores.  Services  Doddle partners with several retail brands in the United Kingdom, including Amazon, ASOS, Missguided, River Island and New Look, and provides over four hundred locations, where their customers can collect and return their online shopping. Doddle also operate their own retail technology platform. This platform allows retailers, like Missguided and Marks & Spencer, to rapidly roll out the latest fulfilment technology, in their own stores, with their own branding. As of , it appears that Amazon no longer offer Doddle as a collection point for parcels, and have started to remove some of the web pages related to Doddle from their site.

The film explores sexual violence and women's rights in Morocco through the Amina Filali affair, a young girl who committed suicide after being forced to marry her rapist in 2012. Plot In March 2012, Amina Filali, a 16-year-old Moroccan girl, committed suicide by swallowing rat poison in a small village outside of Larache. Her suicide came a year after she was forced to marry a man who had raped her. According to Article 475 of the Moroccan penal code, a rapist can escape a jail sentence if he marries his victim. Authorities in Morocco failed to properly investigate Filali's death. Amina's death dominated the Moroccan and international media. Through this horrifying affair, interviews with Filali's parents, her rapist's father, a lawyer and other members of Moroccan civil society, the film delves into the various facets of patriarchy in Morocco while questioning the way it was portrayed by the mainstream media. Production Like Bouhmouch's first film My Makhzen and Me, 475 was produced clandestinely with no shooting permits in what director Nadir Bouhmouch calls \\"an act of civil disobedience\\" against Morocco's state film institution, the Centre Cinematographique Marocain (CCM); and what they perceive as restrictive film laws and censorship. The crew was reduced to a small team of volunteers who had little or no experience in filmmaking. Instead of asking for state funding from the CCM, the filmmakers resorted to a crowd-funding campaign.

She is often described as the \\"last\\" and oldest mambabatok (traditional Kalinga tattooist) and is part of the Butbut people of the larger Kalinga ethnic group. She has been tattooing headhunters and women of the indigenous people of Butbut in Buscalan, Kalinga, since she was 15 years old, but the Butbut warriors who used to earn tattoos by protecting villages or killing enemies no longer exist. Despite this, Whang-od continues to practice her traditional art form on tourists visiting Buscalan. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) conferred on Whang-od the prestigious Dangal ng Haraya Award at Tabuk, the capital of Whang-od's ethnic province of Kalinga, in 2018. She was nominated for the National Living Treasures Award (Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan) in 2017. Her nomination is still being processed by the NCCA. Biography =Career= Whang-od with a tattooed visitor.Whang-od started tattoing at the age of 15, a traditional artform that she learned from her father who was considered a master tattooist in the region. Traditionally, only men with special tattooing ancestry were allowed to learn the art. Whang-od was an exception due to her talent and potential seen by her father. In later life, Whang-od's chosen apprentices constituted of only women, breaking the patrimonial tradition for the first time in recorded Kalinga history. Despite breaking tradition, her community accepted her decision. She has been doing the batok, the traditional hand- tapped tattooing, on male headhunters who earned the tattoos by protecting villages or killing enemies. She also applies tattoos on women of the Butbut people in Buscalan, Kalinga, primarily for aesthetic purposes. As a traditional Kalinga tattooist or mambabatok, she did fortune telling and chants while doing tattoos. Every design she creates contains symbolic meanings specific to the mambabatok culture. For example, a warrior who had killed an enemy would be given an eagle tattoo upon his return from battle. She herself was first tattooed as a teenager with the designs consisting of a ladder and a python. Fatok is the term used for tattooing women to show beauty and wealth. When an arm of woman is tattooed just like Whang-od's own tattoos, the family of the woman is obliged to pay the tattoo artist a piglet or a bundle of harvested rice (locally called as dalan). On the other hand, fi-ing is the term used for tattooing of male Butbut warriors on their chests and arms. Whang-od used to practice fi-ing until headhunting was discouraged by the government. Fi-ing was last practiced in 1972. Though headhunters no longer exist, Whang-od still applies the tattoos on Buscalan tourists. She however no longer chants when tattooing tourists, as the chants are only for the beautification of Kalinga women and for the celebration of Kalinga men's victory in battle. Some of her notable customers include Rhian Ramos, Drew Arellano, Liza Di√±o and Ice Seguerra. Foreigners have also been tattooed by Whang-od. Her early tattoo works did not earn her any income but due to the influx of tourists in her town, she was earning at least Php 5,000 a day for her tattooing in 2015. She accepts around twenty to thirty customers every day. She only does simple tattoos nowadays due to her advanced age. Her apprentices, all women, have continued the tradition for her and their people. The tattoo ink she uses is composed of indigenous materials, usually a mixture of charcoal and water that is tapped into the skin using a thorn from a calamansi or pomelo tree. This ancient technique of batok dates back a thousand years and is relatively painful compared to conventional techniques. She uses designs found in nature and basic geometric shapes. She has numerous signature tattoos, but since 2017, her signature tattoo is composed of three dots, representing herself and her two apprentices, depicted as a continuation of the art form from the older to the next generation. Aside from being a tattoo artist, Whang-od is a respected village elder and plays the nose flute. She also does agricultural tasks, such as feeding pigs and chickens; and cultivating rice. =Personal life= When very young, Whang-od had a boyfriend named Ang-Batang, a Butbut warrior. She personally performed a batok on Ang-Batang after the warrior's first victory in a battle. Many elders opposed her relations with Ang-Batang since many believed that the man's bloodline was not pure. A marriage was eventually arranged for Ang-Batang and Whang-od's best friend Hogkajon. Ang-Batang died as the result of a logging accident when Whang-od was 25 years old.Grace Palicas, Whang-od's grandniece and senior apprentice, doing a facial tattoo and continuing the tradition of batok.She later decided never to marry, and thus has no children and leaves no direct descendants to continue her legacy as a mambabatok or traditional Kalinga tattoo artist. She had relationships with other Kalinga warriors, but remained unmarried due to her vow. According to tradition, her tattooing skills can only be inherited through lineage. Whang-od believes that if someone outside the bloodline starts tattooing, the tattoos will become infected. The influence of modernity meant that the young people of her village were no longer interested in embracing the tattooing works of their elders for decades, until a rise in appreciation of Indigenous ways in the 21st century paved the way for the conservation of the art form in Buscalan. Whang-od has trained Grace Palicas, her grandniece, and Ilyang Wigan, another bloodline successor, to continue her people's tattoo artistry. More bloodline successors have gradually become interested in their people's artforms, including a 12-year-old named Den Wigan. However, these successors have not performed the other works of a mambabatok, and their own tattoos are not as intricate as those of Whang-od. Furthermore, according to Filipino anthropologist Analyn Salvador-Amores, the other batok traditions, which include chanting and fortune-telling, and the revelation of the symbolic meanings of the tattoos, may fade away with Whang-od because these are not transferred to her successors. Chanting and fortune-telling are only performed for the Kalinga people, never for people outside the ethnic sphere. With that, Whang-od may be the last mambabatok of her village, unless (1) the indigenous Kalinga peoples themselves formally choose to get traditional tattoos as part of their modern culture, and (2) her apprentices master the elaborate and highly difficult tattoo chanting arts before she passes away. = Legacy and cultural impact = Senator Nancy Binay stated that Whang-od's impact on Filipino culture has helped raise awareness and keep the knowledge, tradition and culture of Kalinga tattoos alive and known for the younger generations and people outside of Filipino culture.https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/06/22/apo- whang-od-commended-for-raising-kalinga-culture/ The practice of Kalinga tattoos was almost extinct and the idea was obscure, ‚ÄúThe tradition of Batok has changed with the modern times in the last millenia.‚Äùhttp://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160106-an-ancient-ink-technique- sees-new-blood Whang-od's title as the ‚ÄúLast Kalinga Tattoo Artist‚Äù https://theculturetrip.com/asia/philippines/articles/meet-apo-whang-od-the- last-hand-poke-tattoo-artist-in-the-philippines/ will soon be inaccurate. It is said Whang-od is now teaching 20 young girls, plus her grandnieces the art of mambabatok so that the tradition and knowledge will not die with her and so that her legacy will be carried through her students and grandnieces.http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/fang-od-oggay-kalinga-tattoo- philippines Out of her twenty young students that she teaches, only Grace Palicas and Ilyang Wigan are considered her only real apprentices; due to tradition, the apprenticeship of batok must only be passed down and taught to blood relatives.https://thegoodtrip.ph/posts/whang-od Whang-od's ‚Äúsignature‚Äù tattoo consists of three dots, representing herself and her blood-related apprentices and representing a next generation in her art.http://www.positivelyfilipino.com/magazine/from-brooklyn-to-buscalan-a- journey-to-whang-od These Kalinga tattoos, despite consisting of symbols occurring in nature carrying simple geometric patterns, do not carry the same meaning they had when they were earned through warfaring culture. = Centenary = According to various sources, Whang-od was born on February 17, 1917, and she turned 100 in 2017 making her eligible to receive benefits from the Philippine government as per Centenarians Act of 2016 or Republic Act 10868. However, the government and some groups doubted her claim as she has not presented any valid documents to prove her birth date. There were no birth date recordings in many hinterland areas in the Philippines, such as Buscalan, during the time Whang-od was said to be born, namely because of: the impossibility of traversing the area at the time, recordings of birth dates on paper was not a part of the community's culture at the time, and past ethnic tensions that fueled tribal wars. In June 2017, she received a Philippine postal ID, proving her date of birth and effectively making her eligible to the Centenarians Act.  Recognition  Due to Whang-od's status as the last mambabatok of her generation, her role in bringing awareness to a form of traditional tattooing and training several practitioners, many netizens were lobbying her to be one of the National Artists of the Philippines. A hashtag campaign (#WangOdNationalArtist) started in September 2015 and the hashtag was shared through social media about 11 thousand times after almost a month. Some netizens were campaigning for her to be given the National Living Treasures Award instead. In 2015, then Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago urged her colleagues in the Philippine Senate through a resolution that Whang-od should be nominated as one of the National Living Treasures (GAMABA or Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan in Tagalog), who are of equal rank to National Artists. Senator Nancy Binay through a senate resolution in June 2016 enjoined the Philippine senate to nominate Whang-od as a National Living Treasure. Likewise, her nomination as National Artist or National Living Treasure has been backed by Senator and United Nations ambassador Loren Legarda through a separate Senate resolution. Former National Commission for Culture and the Arts of the Philippines (NCCA) chair Felipe de Leon Jr. also expressed his support for Whang-od's nomination and argued that the role of a mambabatok is to become the beacon of togetherness and support of the community. He also added that she aids her community through tattooing tourists and she is practicing traditional Kalinga art form as means of living and therefore should be eligible for both the National Living Treasure Award and the National Artists Award. Filipino anthropologist and University of the Philippines Baguio professor Analyn Salvado-Amores said that though she has no objections on Whang-od's nomination to the GAMABA, Whang-od might not get conferred because she earns from tattooing and one of the requirement for a GAMABA award is to practice the craft without making any profit from it. However, if the raised issue would hinder her declaration as National Living Treasure, then she may still be nominated for the National Artist Award, which is same in rank to the National Living Treasure Award. Whang-od was formally nominated to the National Living Treasures Award during the 66th Manila Fame event on October 21, 2017. The nomination was accepted by the NCCA through a ceremony within the event. NCCA is finalizing the documents to confer Whang-od and have the Philippine President to sign it. Once conferred, Whang-od would get a gold medallion, a monthly allowance of Php 14,000 and a starting grant of Php 100,000. On February 28, 2018, the Senate of the Philippines unanimously passed a resolution supporting and nominating Whang-od for the GAMABA. On June 12, 2018, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts announced that the prestigious Dangal ng Haraya Award will be given to Whang- od on June 25 at Tabuk, Kalinga, the capital of Whang-od's home province. The final stages of the GAMABA (National Living Treasures Award) Committee is still ongoing. Highlights in events Whang-od was present during Dutdutan Tattoo Expo 2012 held in the Philippines where she had her own booth. Whang- od's image is included in an exhibit at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada. The exhibit is entitled Tattoos: Ritual. Identity. Obsession. Art and it was first shown on April 2, 2016. Exhibitors chose the photograph from several photos from another exhibit at Musee Du Quai Branly in Paris. They did not know about Whang-od until a visitor told them. = 2017 Manila visit = In October 2017, Whang-od together with Palicas and Wigan, her apprentices and grandnieces, went to Metro Manila to show their craftsmanship at the 66th Manila Fame trade show. The Philippine Air Force accompanied them through a helicopter on their journey to Manila. Aside from attending the trade show, Whang-od met with Coco Martin, her favorite actor. Meanwhile, Palicas visited Intramuros along with other tattooist in Kalinga. Organizers of the Manila Fame was criticized after a photo that went viral in social media surfaced. In the photo, Whang-od is shown sleeping at the forum in the trade show. Some netizens accused the organizers of exploiting Whang-od by permitting her to tattoo many participants of the event. Critics also added that Whang-od's presence at the trade fair is a commodification of her culture due to fees being charged for the attendees. According to the President of the Philippine Tattoo Artists Guild, Ricky Sta. Ana, the Buscalan village leaders were not aware that Whang-od would be tattooing in the event and the tattoo works at the trade show was not part of the agreement between the village leaders and the organizers of Manila Fame. In contrast, the contract that Whang-od and her grandnieces signed for joining the event involves live tattooing and talks. The Center for International Trade and Expositions and Missions (CITEM), the organizer of the event, though its Executive Director Clayton Tugonon defended the participation of Whang-od in Manila Fame. He said that inclusion of Whang- od at the event was coursed through the Kalinga village elders and proper government agencies namely the Philippine Air Force, Philippine Army, the National Commission on Indigenous People, the Department of Tourism and the Department of Trade and Industry. Whang-od's health was taken care of by a team assigned by the organizers while her travel was safeguarded by the Philippine Army and Philippine Air Force. He made it clear that all revenue obtained from tattoo works of Whang-od and her grandnieces during the trade show were wholly managed by the Kalinga elders. He also denied that there was exploitation because Whang-od herself insisted on doing tattooing works and the organizers cannot stop her. He further commented in the viral photo circulating in social media showing a sleeping Whang-od and said that she was just bored waiting for a talk to end at the forum. Filipino anthropologist Analyn Salvador-Amores commented on the issue and said that someone should have asked Whang-od herself if she was really exploited. She also urged that there should be sensibility and sensitivity to culture, and respect to the tradition of the tattooist, regardless of where the practitioner is located. She praised the organizers for bringing Whang-od with all the necessary preparations but it could have been planned better. She also criticized the organizers for cordoning the tattoo artists that made them look like paid public performers. She suggested that the event could have been better if there were more interactions and not exclusive. Amidst the debate of exploitation, Palicas sent an SMS message to organizers telling them that they were honored to come to Manila and Whang-od wanted to experience different cultures. She also said in a social media post that they, the tattoo artists, signed a contract for the event and they have done the tattoo works at the event at their own free will. She also added that it would make them look like foolish persons if the issues concerning the events continue. Eva Oggay, another relative of Whang-od, posted on social media that the Kalinga contingent in the event were happy to come to Manila and Whang-od is happy to meet people in Manila. Television features American anthropologist Lars Krutak visited Kalinga in 2007 and documented Whang-od's tattoo works. The episode of Krutak's 10-part series Tattoo Hunter featured on Discovery Channel became the start of presenting the Kalinga culture and Whang-od to a global audience. In 2010, she was also featured in i-Witness, a documentary television program of GMA Network, that was documented by Kara David. In 2017, Whang-od was featured in the Dayaw series of the NCCA and ABS-CBN News Channel, where her contributions to the country's national identity and heritage were presented by former NCCA Chairman Felipe De Leon Jr. and Senator Loren Legarda. Her life story was featured in Wagas, a GMA News TV's drama series in 2017, where Janine Gutierrez portrayed Whang-od.

Early life, education, and career Born in Litchfield, Connecticut, Strong was the sixth child of Supply Strong (originally of Hebron, Connecticut, and in 1723 one of the first settlers of Litchfield) and Supply's second wife, Anne.Oscar Jewell Harvey, Ernest Gray Smith, A History of Wilkes-Barr√©, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania (1909), p. 778. Strong received a Bachelor of Arts from Yale College in 1761, and a Master of Arts in 1764. He studied theology, and was licensed to preach by the Hartford North Association of Ministers on October 4, 1763. However, he almost immediately turned his attention to law, and after a year of study was admitted (in 1764) to the Bar of Hartford County. He then began practicing law in Litchfield. Political career From 1770 to 1783, Strong served as one of the Selectmen of Litchfield, and from 1773 to 1781 was Town Clerk. In October, 1771, he attended the Connecticut General Assembly as one of the Representatives from Litchfield, and from then until 1780 he sat as a Representative in thirty regular sessions of the Assembly. At thirteen of these sessions he was Clerk of the Lower House. In 1774 he was chosen a Delegate to the Continental Congress, but declined the office. From 1780 to 1791 he was a Judge of the Litchfield County Court. During the Revolutionary War he was a Commissary of Supplies for the Continental Army. In 1788 he was a member of the State Convention which adopted the Constitution of the United States, and in 1781 and 1790 he was a member of the Governor's Council, or Upper House of the Connecticut Assembly. He was an unsuccessful candidate for one of Connecticut's five at-large seats in the 1788 United States House of Representatives election in Connecticut. Personal life and decline On April 17, 1774, Strong married Ruth Patterson (born June 16, 1739), daughter of Major John Patterson of Farmington, Connecticut. She died October 3, 1777, leaving a daughter, and on January 22, 1788, Strong married Susannah Wyllys, daughter of the Hon. George Wyllys. She was about twelve years his junior, and in July, 1790, after two and a half years of married life, she \\"was compelled by his cruel behavior to apply for a divorce\\", which was granted by the Governor's Council, of which Strong was then a member. Strong \\"was then cast out of all decent society\\", having \\"already forfeited the esteem of his fellow-townsmen by his bad private character, although by hypocrisy and political intrigue he had been able up to this date to impose upon a wider public\\". He was \\"a man of diminutive figure, limping gait and an unpleasant countenance\\", and is said to have succeeded in gaining his great ascendancy in his town and district \\"by his arts as a pettifogger and a politician\\". Strong later became an alcoholic, and it was deemed necessary to have a guardian appointed over him. His means became exhausted, and the town was obliged to assist in his support until his death.

Built between 1908 and 1916, it has served as the primary social and community event hall in the small rural community for more than 100 years. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The Jonesboro Grange is located in the town's dispersed rural village, on the south side of Harrington Road (US 1), the principal east-west artery in the region. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a poured concrete foundation. Its front facade is symmetrical, with a pair of sash windows flanking a double-leaf entrance that is topped by a three-light transom window. A small sash window is set in the gable above. The first-floor windows on the front and sides are flanked by three-board shutters, and have small flower boxes below the sill. The interior is divided into a foyer space and main hall, with stairs leading up to a balcony and down to the full basement in one corner of the foyer. The interior of the foyer and main hall are finished in vertical bead-board wainscoting, with plaster above in the foyer and painted tin on the main hall. The basement is partially finished, providing a kitchen and dining space as well as storage.Thompson, Megan (2010). NRHP nomination for Jonesboro Grange No. 357; available by requested from the Maine SHPO. The Jonesboro Grange was organized in 1900, a period of significant growth of the organization in Maine, and originally met in the town office building. In 1904 planning began for the construction of a meeting hall. Land was purchased in 1907, construction of the exterior was completed in 1910, and the interior was finished in 1916. The building was originally located west of its present location, and was moved in 1956 to accommodate a widened Harrington Road. At that time a new foundation was poured, and the fixtures of the original basement were relocated to the new basement. The building was electrified in 1927. The Jonesboro Grange has, since its inception, been an organizing force for community events, and its hall has been a social and community event space. The Grange organizes events on the Fourth of July and during the Christmas holiday period, and provides the only public kitchen in the rural community. In the late 1950s it also acted as a temporary school during renovations to the town's high school.

It was founded in 2007 by the Lilongwe Wildlife Trust (LWT), with support from the Born Free Foundation. The Centre is a member of the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance. Aims Lilongwe Wildlife Trust's mission is to \\"protect Malawi‚Äôs wildlife by helping wild animals in need, combatting wildlife crime and empowering guardians of the wild.\\" They focus on four areas of work: wildlife rescue and welfare, education and advocacy, wildlife law enforcement, and wildlife research. Lilongwe Wildlife Centre falls under the wildlife rescue and welfare branch of the organisation's work with the aim to participate in in-situ conservation work in Malawi. The Wildlife Centre provides sanctuary space for rescued, confiscated, orphaned and injured wild animals, meeting international animal welfare standards (e.g. PASA & GFAS). Wild animals that undergo rehabilitation at the Wildlife Centre are released back into protected areas whenever possible under controlled and monitored conditions. Additionally, the Wildlife Centres carries out work to promote wildlife conservation and welfare and to support statutory authorities. Inside the park Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Lilongwe Wildlife Centre was set up by LWT, with support from the Born Free Foundation, in 2007 as sanctuary for rehabilitating Malawi's injured, orphaned and confiscated wildlife. The majority of intakes are handled on site. The Wildlife Centre is currently Malawi's only PASA accredited wildlife sanctuary and is responsible for caring for ca. 200 wild animals annually, including birds, reptiles, carnivores, primates and antelope species. The majority of the Wildlife Centre's intake are rescued as orphans and victims of the illegal pet and bushmeat trade, which is still prevalent in Malawi, or wildlife which has sustained injuries from poaching attempts and human wildlife conflicts. Many of their rehabilitated animals are released back into the wild or, if not, remain at the Wildlife Centre in large natural enclosures. Lilongwe Wildlife Centre is supported by leading animal welfare organisations such as Born Free Foundation, Stitching AAP, Tusk Trust, International Primate Society and International Primate Protection League. In 2011, Lilongwe Wildlife Centre received a Responsible Tourism award for Best Organisation for Wildlife Conservation. Additionally, LWT run a veterinary Wildlife Emergency Response Unit (WERU) which is available for cases around the country that require on- site attention. WERU is a joint initiative between the Malawi Government and LWT. Wildlife Advocacy and Enforcement LWT launched a campaign called 'Stop Wildlife Crime - Protect Malawi's Wildlife‚Äô in 2014 in conjunction with the Malawi Government, calling for attitudinal and behavioural change, sensitising the general public, decision makers and law enforcement agencies. There other advocacy and enforcement work includes: lead partner in a toolkit assessment on the nature and status of illegal wildlife trade in Malawi completed on behalf of Government; partnering with the Government to review and strengthen the National Parks and Wildlife Act of Malawi (NPWA); local NGO representative on the steering committee of the Malawi National Elephant Action Plan; provision of civil society representation to the Inter-Agency Committee on Combating Wildlife Crime (IACCWC) in Malawi; and the principal supporter of proactive wildlife investigations in Malawi. In 2018, LWT supported the Malawi Government in introducing the country's first wildlife detection dogs at Malawian airports. LWT is Malawi's sole representative on the Species Survival Network and a founding civil society member of ICCF in Malawi.http://internationalconservation.org/malawi-passes-wildlife-amendments- stiffens-penalties-for-poachers-traffickers Education and Community Outreach LWT's Lilongwe Environmental Education Programme (LEEP) aims to frequently engage local students, covering topics including wildlife crime, human-wildlife conflict, wildlife welfare and biodiversity. The programme's sister programme, PEEP, similarly educates those living near Protected Areas, in partnership with local NGO's. LWT's community outreach programmes include adult literacy, bee keeping, afforestation, permaculture, tree planting and alternative fuels. Wildlife Research Lilongwe Wildlife Trust's research work covers wildlife welfare, wildlife management and conservation medicine, working both independently and with partners. Key projects include urban hyaena relocation, adaptation of primates released into the wild, and disease screening for captive wild animals.

She is mostly known for the band Katzenjammer. Sol works in different genres, such as folk, rock, pop, bluegrass, classical, blues, soul, country, tribe, klezmer and electronica. Her instruments are drums, trumpet, bass, guitar, melodic percussion, ukulele, domra, banjo, balalaika, zither, harp, flute, accordion, piano, harmonica and mandolin.  Early life  Sol grew up in B√¶rum, Norway as the youngest of four children. From their early years they all showed great aptitude for music, and learned to sing before learning to talk. She has written music with her brother Kristan Heilo, and her other brother √òyvind Heilo is also musically active. Their father Arne Heilo MD taught them how to play the piano, and their mother Bente Heilo sang with them every day. Sol showed little interest in sheet music, and using her high capacity for aural recall and pitch memory she quickly played anything by ear. At the age of 7, Sol started playing percussion in a marching band, Haslum Skoles Jentekorps, and immediately showed skill and understanding of music. At the age of 12, she participated as a drummer in the Olympic torch relay for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, together with a group of ten years older percussionists from the Norwegian Academy of Music.

The episode premiered on Comedy Central on October 21, 2015. It parodies the idea of safe spaces while also continuing the season-long lampoon on political correctness. Plot Cartman is in PC Principal's office crying after receiving negative comments for his appearance in a picture he posted online of himself wearing only underwear and lifting weights. Principal suggests having another student filter out negative comments on Cartman's social media accounts and printing out only the positive comments to Cartman. Cartman agrees and Principal asks Kyle, Wendy, and Butters to filter out the negative comments. Kyle and Wendy get two weeks of detention when they refuse, but Butters, fearful of being grounded by his parents, agrees. Meanwhile, at Whole Foods Market, Randy is pressured by a cashier to give additional money for poor starving children while paying for groceries. The cashier continues increasingly pressuring him to make donations in his subsequent visits until he finally makes a donation, but is then embarrassed again by the cashier for only giving one dollar to charity. Principal holds a student assembly featuring guest speaker Steven Seagal, who tells the students that he has also been a victim of body shaming like Cartman. Principal orders Butters to help Seagal in the same manner he has been helping Cartman. Eventually, Butters is filtering negative comments for an increasingly large number of people, including Demi Lovato and Vin Diesel, which requires him to stay up late at night and suffer from sleep deprivation. Randy films a commercial featuring poor starving children to support his cause to make the supermarket a safe space free of \\"charity shaming\\". Cartman, Randy, and others sing an original song about their safe space, with the song introducing the personification of \\"Reality\\", who threatens to destroy their safe spaces. Randy and others make a new commercial to support a shameless America in which citizens are not criticized for any of their attributes or actions. In order to pressure the Whole Foods Market cashier to stop asking him for donations, Randy tells him that he is hosting a charity fundraiser dinner for his shameless America. The cashier then asks Randy if he will help put a hamster through college, and eventually Randy replies that his fundraiser is actually aiding the cause of sending hamsters to college, for which the cashier happily wishes him a good day. Meanwhile, a sleep-deprived Butters begins hallucinating that Reality is appearing in his room and threatening him. This results in a traumatized Butters showing up at school in the nude and jumping out of a window, for which he is hospitalized. The charity dinner, hosted by model Gigi Hadid, is disrupted by Reality, who angrily tells the guests they are all living in denial and informs them what has happened to Butters as a result of their relegating all of the negativity directed towards them to Butters. In response, they make a new commercial to help raise money for iPads for poor starving children so that they can filter negative comments from the fundraisers' social media accounts. At the town center, the citizens opt to have Butters publicly execute Reality by hanging him. Critical reception IGN's Max Nicholson gave the episode a 7.3 out of 10 and commented that the storyline with Randy and the supermarket donations \\"hit its mark this week. Not only was it relatable, but it also touched on some of the same points Cartman's storyline addressed, but in a finer, more innovative way\\" but felt the episode had a \\"vague stance\\". Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 3 out of 5 stars, and stated that \\"What‚Äôs really paying off in the episode, and this season as a whole, is South Park‚Äôs ability to play an issue down the middle.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Dan Caffrey gave a B+ rating to the episode, noting the blend of the two storylines was \\"a strategy that, on top of being comedically surprising, often forces the viewer to keep their own feelings of superiority in check.\\" References External links *Episode 1905: \\"Safe Space\\" Press Release South Park Studios.

During his life he served as a surveyor and was part of the Surry County militia. He was made a Major at some point between the fall of 1680 and the spring of the following year. Personal life Allen was born to Arthur and Alice Tucker Allen around 1652, likely at the family home in what would later become Surry County, Virginia. He was educated in England and after his father died in 1669, Allen inherited his father's estate, which included the Allen family house, now known as Bacon's Castle. Allen later married the daughter of Lawrence Baker, Katherine Baker, with whom he had eight children. He died on June 15, 1710. Political career In the 1670s Allen began serving on the Lawnes Creek Parish and became a member of the Surry County Court. He was friends with Sir William Berkeley and was with the Governor when Allen's home was seized by followers of Nathaniel Bacon. While Allen was able to reclaim his home, Bacon's followers had caused a massive amount of damage to the property. Because of his close association with Berkeley, Allen was appointed to the quorum of the Surry County court in May 1677. Allen lost this office for about a year's span of time due to the actions of Lieutenant Governor Herbert Jeffreys, but regained it after the man's death. Beginning in the 1680s Allen served several terms on the Virginia House of Burgesses. He was considered to be a man of influence and was twice elected to serve as the Speaker of the House. His service was occasionally met with resistance from Virginian leaders and on two occasions Governor Francis Howard dissolved the assembly because he saw Allen as one of his major opponents among the other burgess-elect. In the 1691 assembly Allen was one of two burgess-elect that refused to take their seats due to a new oath of allegiance and supremacy that was written to recognize the rule of William III and Mary II following the Glorious Revolution. Allen did not subscribe to the oaths until the spring of 1702, after the death of James II. He sought re-election to the House of Burgesses in 1703, but was unsuccessful. Out of anger Allen tried to block the appointment of the winner, Thomas Swan, only for this to prompt an investigation into Allen's conduct.

He was educated privately. thumbPrince Narendra Bikram Shah, younger brother of Crown Prince Trailokya Bikram Shah of Nepal. At that time, the king had little power. The political leadership and dominance was held by the members of the family of the Kunwar family, that is, the family of Jung Bahadur Rana, who was the first Rana prime minister of Nepal. Prince Narendra's elder brother, Crown Prince Trailokya, was involved in conspiracies against the Rana ruler, but died under suspicious circumstances in 1878. After Trailokya's death, Narendra assumed the leadership in the conspiracy against the Rana ruler. He was involved in this conspiracy along with two of Jung Bahadur's sons. The plan was never carried out, reportedly because Jung Bahadur's sons insisted that no conspiracy should be carried out in the year of mourning following their father's death. Three years later, in 1881, several people were arrested for plotting against the Rana ruler. One of the arrested people revealed that Prince Narendra and two of Jung Bahadur's sons had been involved in a conspiracy against the Rana ruler. All three of them were exiled. Prince Narendra was sent to Chunar, India. In April 1885, the prince was pardoned and was allowed to return to Kathmandu. However, the then Rana prime minister, Ranodip Singh Kunwar was killed by his nephews in a coup d'√©tat in November 1885. After the coup d'√©tat, Prince Narendra then lived in Tallo Durbar of Gorkha which is known as Gorkha Museum now. Prince Narendra was married and had several children.

Brown Cottage is a historic summer house at 9 Delano Park in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. Built in 1886-87, it is a fine local example of the Shingle Style then popular for such properties, and is an important mature work in that style of Portland architect John Calvin Stevens. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The C.A. Brown Cottage is located on the eastern shore of Cape Elizabeth, just south of Portland Head Light, overlooking Casco Bay. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a weathered wood shingle exterior and a fieldstone foundation. It is basically rectangular in plan, with a double-gable roof whose gables are joined by a higher cross gable. The end of the cross gable projects over a porch recessed under a continuation of the roofline of the other gable, with stone pier supports. The upper level under the cross gable originally had an open loggia, but this has since been enclosed. An ell extends to the rear, its gambrel roof oriented on the same axis as the transverse gable. The house was designed by John Calvin Stevens and built in 1886-87. Stevens was a proponent of an organic form of architecture, in which the building materials were harmonized with their surroundings. This is exemplified in this house by the use of fieldstone similar to the bedrock on which the house rests, and the use of wood shingles. The house received favorable publication reviews in architectural publications in 1886 and 1890, and was included by Stevens in his own book.

It seems that Kebsi contracted a significant debt of 60 gold deben towards Sobeknakht;, p. 161 not having the possibility to pay, Kebsi decided to sell his office to Sobeknakht who would become the new governor of El-Kab, with all the benefits that this charge entailed.

The genealogy and all the passages of the government office can be summarized as follows: *The earliest person mentioned is Vizier Aya and his wife, the King's daughter Reditenes. The couple had two sons, Aya ‚Äúthe younger‚Äù and Ayameru. *Aya ‚Äúthe younger‚Äù held the government office until his unexpected death, when the office passed to his younger brother Ayameru. *Later, Ayameru inherited the vizierate from his father. This happened in the regnal Year 1 of a king Merhotepre, very likely Merhotepre Ini of the 13th Dynasty. *The now-Vizier Ayameru left the government office to his son Kebsi. *Kebsi sold the office to Sobeknakht. This happened in the regnal Year 1 of king Nebiryraw I (i.e. the date on which the stela was issued). The Vizier confirmed that Kebsi was heir of the office of governor of El-Kab. The whole process was sealed in the Vizier's quarters with the participation of witnesses, whereupon Sobeknakht received the rights to the office. On a separate note, this Sobeknakht was no other than the father of the more famous governor of El-Kab, Sobeknakht II. Importance The monument is considered one of the most important of its kind, because it provides valuable juridical information about the provincial administration in Ancient Egypt, and about both the inheritance of an office and the possibility of trading it. The Juridical Stela is also an important temporal link within a quite obscure period of Egyptian history ‚Äì the Second Intermediate Period ‚Äì between the 13th Dynasty king Merhotepre and the later Theban king Nebiryraw I.

He was lord of Pesaro, Gradara, Senigallia, Fossombrone and Civitanova Marche. He was the son of Malatesta IV Malatesta and Elisabetta da Varano. Life In 1409 he followed his father to Florence to fight against the King of Naples's army. In 1421 he fought for the Papal States against Perugia and for a short time for the Florentines against Milan. He and his brother Galeazzo were captured at Gradara in 1424 after their father's and their cousin Carlo's defeat at Zagonara by the Visconti. Carlo joined the Visconti army and in 1426 fought in Romagna against the Anti-Visconti League. In 1427 he was made captain general of the Visconti armies, putting him in command of 1,200 cavalry in the battle against Francesco Bussone. The Visconti force was defeated at Pizzighettone and Carlo was captured again until being freed when the two sides made peace. In 1428 Carlo married Vittoria Colonna, Pope Martin V's niece, but the couple remained childless. In 1430 he fought against Rimini but was defeated and fled from Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. Shortly afterwards he defended Bologna against an attack by Anton Galeazzo Bentivoglio. In 1431 a revolt broke out in Pesaro, forcing Carlo to retreat to Fossombrone then to Gradara and elsewhere. In 1433 he helped the Montefeltro and the Visconti reconquer their own lands. The resulting treaty brought peace between the Papal States and the two Malatesta brothers, Carlo and Galeazzo. Carlo returned to Pesaro on 24 September and killed all those who had revolted two years earlier. Bibliography *E. Angiolini and A.

The building is used as an apartment building and has a total of 108 units. Porthos has 32 floors. Porthos was built between the springs of 2004 and 2006. ING Real Estate Development was the developer of the apartment building. That company was given the task to renovate and expand a shopping center called Woensel. The municipality of Eindhoven asked ING to add residential use to the shopping center. The company added three residential buildings to Woensel, collectively called \\"De Drie Musketiers\\" (Dutch for The Three Musketeers), of which Porthos is the tallest. Porthos was built on top of the shopping center. Also an underground parking garage was built underneath the apartment building. The firm Engelman designed Porthos with the help of the engineering firm Zonneveld. The costs of the construction amounted to ‚Ç¨24.5 million. Porthos consists of prefab concrete parts and because of that the building was topped out within one hundred days. When the prefab elements were placed on their locations, they already had been equipped with glass and pipes. The exterior of Porthos is made of ceramic bricks and aluminium. The chambranles consist of aluminium as well. A rooftop terrace, that is only accessible to the inhabitants of the penthouses, is situated on top of the apartment building. All apartment units are owner-occupied and according to Gerard van de Ven, manager real estate at Hurks, seventeen units had been sold previous to the start of the construction. Almost all units had been sold by the time the building was finished, according to Van de Ven. On November 14, 2007, it was announced that Porthos won the 2007 Betonprijs in the category \\"execution\\". The judge said the construction of Porthos didn't cause much disturbance because of the short duration of the construction and because of the relatively small space the construction required. According to the judge, this was the result of the extensive prefabrication.

Life and career Born at Hawkstone Hall, near Hodnet, Shropshire, Hill was the seventh son of Sir John Hill, 3rd Baronet. He was brother to Robert, Clement and Rowland, who would go on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Army. He entered the army on 25September 1801, at the age of seventeen, as a cornet in the 10th (Prince of Wales's Own) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Hussars) and purchased a lieutenancy the following year. In 1806, by now a captain, he exchanged to the 53rd Regiment of Foot and served as aide-de-camp to his brother Rowland in England and Ireland before accompanying him to Portugal in 1808. Hill was present at the subsequent battles of Roleia and Vimeiro, as well as during the retreat of Sir John Moore's army following the Battle of Corunna. When the Portuguese Army was created in 1809 under Lieutenant-General William Beresford, Hill was appointed to the command of the 1st Portuguese Regiment, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and made brevet Major in the British Army at the same time. Together with the Portuguese 16th (Vieira Telles) Regiment and the 4th Regiment of Ca√ßadores, Hill's unit completed the 1st Independent Brigade under the command of Sir Denis Pack, which subsequently took part in the Battle of Busaco on 27September 1810.

He was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel on the 25July 1814 and knighted on the 28th of the same month. Back in England he retired for a time on half-pay. In 1825 he was promoted to Colonel and in 1827, after applying to the then Commander-in- chief, the Duke of Wellington, he was appointed Deputy Adjutant-General in Canada. Death Having succeeded Sir John Brown as commander of the cavalry depot at Maidstone in Kent, he died in office on 8January 1832 aged 47 after a short illness.

The PC version has been released September 29, 2014. The Wii U version was released worldwide on January 28, 2016. Gameplay Promo artwork for Shadow Puppeteer The game can be played both in single-player mode or shared screen local co-op. A boy and his shadow have to cooperate to make their way and find the evil shadow puppeteer. Together they need to solve puzzles based on manipulating three types of lightsources and three shadow tools called \\"stencils\\" in-game. The puzzles are a mix of 2D and 3D, as the boy is free to move in any direction, while the shadow is limited to being projected on 2D surfaces and using shadows cast by objects as platforms. Moving an object also moves its shadow. Similarly, moving a shadow can move the object casting it. In order to solve the puzzles, the players can also manipulate the light sources and alter the dimensions of the shadows. On their way, the boy and the shadow pass through 5 different worlds. Each world introduces new elements the players need to master. An example would be a shadow scissors which allows the shadow to cut shadow strings. Another element would be the shadow bombs, which allow the shadow to destroy both the shadow of a wall and the wall itself. In their path, the two characters also have to fight shadow monsters. Even though each character can act independently, the two are connected with a string. Increasing the distance too much leads to the string snapping and the player having to start the level over. The two characters share similarities, but each have their own limitations and abilities. Story The story starts in the evening, as an evil man, the shadow puppeteer, arrives in the village. The atmosphere is dark, whimsical and gloomy. The puppeteer plays his music box and harvests the shadows of everyone in the village. Only the main character, a little boy, still has his shadow. He falls through the floor and becomes separated from his shadow as the puppeteer tries to harvest it. The music box breaks so the puppeteer leaves without the boy's shadow. The game consists of the boy's and the shadow's journey to find the shadow puppeteer and free the stolen shadows. On their way, they go through five worlds, fight shadow monsters and cooperate to solve physics puzzles based on manipulation of light and shadow. The story is told without any actual dialogue or text, but with the help of visuals and music. Development Initially conceived as a student project at Hedmark University College, Norway, the game has been in development since 2010 when the Sarepta Studio was founded. The developer, Sarepta Studio is a 3D visualization firm and independent video game developer based in Hamar, Norway. The development of the game was funded by Nordic Game Program, Innovation Norway and the Norwegian Film Institute. Reception Since its release, the game has received mixed to positive reviews, receiving a Metascore of 57%. While the game has been praised for original gameplay, level design, the music, whimsical cartoony art and gloomy atmosphere, there has been some negative feedback. The complaints have mostly been related to the game being too difficult in single player mode, demanding controls and placement of checkpoints. A major update has been released 14 September 2015, addressing some of the issues mentioned by reviews. Destructoid awarded it a score of 5 out of 10, saying \\"Shadow Puppeteer tries to do interesting things, but ultimately comes off as unpolished, bland, repetitive, and mediocre.\\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-shadow-puppeteer-338045.phtml References External links * *Sarepta Studio Official Developer's Website Category:2014 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Platform games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Video games developed in Norway Category:Wii U eShop games Category:Windows games ","title":"Shadow Puppeteer"},{"id":"48289824","text":"Edmee Janss (born 4 July 1965) is a former Dutch international cricketer who played 21 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for the Dutch national side, including at the 1993 and 1997 World Cups.

The teeth are also unusual for showing signs of cavities, a feature typically not found in teeth older than 50,000 years. Geology Fuyan consists of three caves connected by tunnels. The cave system has a volume of and ranges over . Discovery Fuyan Cave was discovered in 1984. The cave is located at latitude 25¬∞39‚Ä≤02.7‚Ä≥N, longitude 111¬∞28‚Ä≤49.2‚Ä≥E, at 232 m above sea level. The cave was excavated in 2011 over an area of . The 2011 excavation revealed 5 hominin teeth and fossil remains from 39 different mammalians species, including some extinct ones. The cave was excavated in 2011 and in 2013. The teeth were all discovered in the middle cave. Dating The teeth were dated by dating nearby stalagmites. The stalagmites were dated to at least 80,000 years. Since the teeth were found under rock over which the stalagmites had grown, the teeth must be older than 80,000 years old. Implications The discovery is important for many reasons. Previous to this discovery, the earliest evidence for fully modern humans outside the Arabian Peninsula (Tianyuan Cave, Niah Cave, Mungo Man) dates to around 40,000 to 50,000 years, so the discovery at Fuyan Cave provides evidence showing that humans migrated out of Africa a lot earlier than previously assumed. Secondly, the finds at Fuyan Cave are much closer to modern humans than they are to contemporary finds at Xujiayao and Qafzeh. Thirdly, the discovery shows that modern humans arrived in southern China when there was an older, more primitive hominin present in northern China. Lastly, the discovery shows that modern humans were present in Asia at a time when there is no evidence for fully modern humans in Europe (43,000 BC), which is perhaps explained by the presence of Neanderthals in Europe preventing the entry of the modern humans.

Since 2001, Jos has been the site of riots and communal violence leading to significant death and displacement estimated well into the thousands. The Jos Forum dialogue process spanned 16 months from August 2013 - December 2014, ultimately leading to a \\"Declaration of Commitment to Peace\\" signed by the participating communities (Afizere, Anaguta, Berom, Fulani, Hausa, Igbo, South-South and Yoruba, as well as women who were represented as their own distinct community).  Background  The ‚ÄòMiddle Belt‚Äô region of Nigeria refers to the imprecise dividing line between a mostly Muslim north and the mainly Christian south. Surrounded by divergent religious, economic, and cultural histories, the middle belt has been the melting pot where small and large ethno-religious groups in Nigeria have long coexisted, but where they have also increasingly collided over land, resources, identity and political power. In particular, Jos city in Plateau State has been a centre for ethno- religious disputes and violence since the 1990s. The Nigerian state responded to these episodes of violence by either launching security force operations (military and police) or by establishing commissions of inquiry at the Federal and State levels of Government. However, independent reports have observed that these actions have not achieved permanent security and the Nigerian Government itself stated that recommendations by the commissions of inquiry were not followed up: \\"[The 2010 Presidential Advisory Committee on the Jos Crisis] found that the recommendations of the previous reports on past crises in the State had not been implemented\\".  Dialogue Process  Following the numerous previous attempts to resolve conflict in Jos, the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) launched a community-driven process in 2013, which was steered by the main protagonists and the victims of conflict - the local communities (Afizere, Anaguta, Berom, Fulani, Hausa, Igbo, South-South, Yoruba. In addition, women were participating as their own distinct community). Over the course of 16 months, HD convened a series of discussions on several issues of concern, including: * Trust building and religious tolerance. * Rebuilding places of worship, and access to burial grounds * Issues relating to youth and unemployment * Governance issues * Traditional rulership issues * Jos City issues such as ownership and indigeneship * Countryside issues such as cattle rustling and land disputes * Impunity, reparations and compensation. * Securing lives and property Following each dialogue session, the forum developed recommendations, which ultimately formed the basis of the implementation phase of the project.  Outcomes  The dialogue process culminated in a ceremony held in Jos on 12 December 2014 to mark the achievements of the forum and to launch the implementation phase of the project. The ceremony was attended by representatives of the government, civil society and prominent members of the concerned communities. It culminated in the signing of a Joint Declaration of Commitment to Peace. The declaration begins with a general description of the consensus reached, but goes on to commit the signatory communities to cooperate for the sake of peace: > \\"During the dialogue sessions, we learned much about each other‚Äôs fears and > desires, and have come to recognize several general truths, including that > tolerance and respect serve as the foundation for peaceful living; dialogue > rather than violence is the preferred means of resolving disputes; and that > uniting around common values and ideals can achieve more progress and > development than emphasizing differences. Further, we agreed that the > actions of individuals should not be attributed to communities as a whole. > Instead, our communities should work together to prevent wicked and > criminal-minded individuals and small groups from wrecking any more havoc in > our city and its environs.\\" The endorsed recommendations committed the communities to pursue their implementation in coordination with Federal, State, and Local Governments and civil society. One of the activities involved the reconstruction and rehabilitation of several destroyed schools, churches and mosques. The communities took further initiative to legally register the \\"Jos Peace Dialogue Forum\\" as a recognized Nigerian non-profit, to serve as a sustainable and impartial dialogue mechanism to be used by the communities to handle disputes. In 2015, the Jos Peace Dialogue Forum has already served as a platform for various political parties to discuss challenges and commit to peaceful elections in 2015.

The species is solely known from the Middle Eocene Baltic amber deposits in the Baltic Sea region of Europe. The species is one of six described from Baltic amber. History and classification Elephantomyia (Elephantomyia) pulchella is known from the holotype specimen, collection number MB.J.336, along with two further adults which are preserved as inclusions in transparent Baltic amber. As of 2015, the holotype specimen was included in the collections of the Natural History Museum Humboldt University, while another was housed at the Polish Academy of Sciences, and the last resided in a private collection. Baltic amber is recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Baltic Sea region of Europe. Estimates of the age date between 37 million years old, for the youngest sediments and 48 million years old. This age range straddles the middle Eocene, ranging from near the beginning of the Lutetian to the beginning of the Pribonian. E. pulchella is one of six crane fly species in the genus Elephantomyia described from the Baltic amber, the others being E. baltica, E. bozenae, E. brevipalpa, E. irinae, and E. longirostris. All six species are placed into the Elephantomyia subgenus Elephantomyia based on the lack of tibial spurs and by several aspects of the wing morphology. The fossil was first studied by entomologist Hermann Loew of the Germany, with his type description of the new species being published in 1851 as Toxorhina pulchella, though he published the nomen nudum name a year earlier. The species was moved to the genus Limnobiorhynchus in 1860 by Carl Robert Osten-Sacken, and later moved by Osten-Sacken again, this time to the genus Elephantomyia. The fossils were reexamined and the species redescribed in 2015 by paleoentomologist Iwona Kania of the University of Rzesz√≥w, who examined the holotype and the two additional specimens. Description All studied E. pulchella type specimens are preserved males, with the females of the species unknown as of 2015. The body length ranges from approximately long, not including the rostrum. The head has a rostrum which is similar in length to the abdomen and about ‚Öî the wing length, being between long. This rostrum to wing and abdomen ratio is not seen in the other described Baltic amber Elephantomyia. The rostrum has elongated palpus at the tip, each composed of four segments and having a system of microtrichia hairs. The basal three palpus segments are elongated cylinders, while the apical segments are shortest. The fifteen segmented antennae are small, composed of an elongated scape, widened pedicle and thirteen flagellomeres. As the flagellomeres progress from the base to the tip of the antennae they change from squat and crowded together to elongated. The five flagellomeres at the base have two long setae on them, while the next three flagellomeres have three setae. Flagellomeres ten to thirteen have four setae each, while the elongated segments fourteen and fifteen do not have any. The wings are between long with a pale brown pterostigma that is oval in shape. The Rs vein, as designated by the Comstock‚ÄìNeedham system, is slightly curved and about 5 times the length of the base segment of the R5 vein. The Rs is shorter than the length of the connected R2+3+4 vein.

His artistic work spanned half a century and included around 3,000 abstract works on paper, board and canvas, mostly acrylic, ink, enamel and oil paintings as well as crayon, pencil and coloured pencil drawings. Volpe's work is marked by geometric and linear elements, organic shapes, lively colours and the extensive use of black. His most significant influences can be found in the New York School of painting of the fifties and sixties, his architecture studies, and his roots in Colombia's Caribbean. Volpe's estate is managed by the ‚ÄúART-Nachlassstiftung‚Äù ART-Nachlassstiftung, Mario Volpe in Bern, Switzerland.  Life  Volpe was born in Barranquilla, Colombia,Sikart, Swiss Institute for Art Research: Mario A. Volpe on October 19, 1936, as a son of Italian immigrants. As a 12-year-old he made his first trips to New York and Italy. After completing his school years in Barranquilla, he moved to the United States at the age of 19 to study English and prepare for college at the Wilbraham AcademyThe Academy World, Monson and Wiilbraham Academy, Fall 2008 (now Wilbraham and Monson Academy) in Massachusetts. In his studio in Bern, 1972 At the age of 20, Volpe made his first direct encounter with contemporary art, at the Venice Biennale in 1956. That year, he took up his studies in architecture at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture) in Pittsburgh. After completing his architecture diploma in 1961, a scholarship from the Carnegie Institute allowed him to spend a summer at the American Academy in Fontainebleau, France, where he started to experiment with abstract drawing and became acquainted with painters and sculptors. Volpe was accepted into the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where he completed a year of the Masters class in architecture. In 1962, however, he decided to leave Harvard in order to fully devote himself to painting. He enrolled in the Art Students League of New York where he attended free classes for two years. In 1964, a travel scholarship from the Art Students League took him on a study trip through Europe (London, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Madrid and Sevilla). After a year in Rome, where he met his wife, Brigit Scherz, Volpe moved back to the United States, to take up a position as assistant professor in the Studio Arts Department of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. After five years of teaching at the University of Minnesota, Volpe moved back to Europe in 1970. He spent a year living and working in Turin, Italy, and then moved to Bern, Switzerland, in 1972, where he married Brigit Scherz in 1973. Their two children, Martina and Philippe, were born in 1974 and 1975. Volpe lived and worked in Bern until his death on 21 August 2013, at the age of 76.

She played an important role in various early Japanese women's rights movements and she was a crucial part of Japan's consumer movement. She was a renowned activist in the 1920s, co-founding the New Women's Association with Hiratsuka Raich≈ç and Ichikawa Fusae, and eventually held a seat in the House of Councilors from 1947 to 1965 when she retired. Biography =Life and activism= Oku Mumeo was born the eldest daughter of a third-generation blacksmith on October 24, 1895 outside of Fukui. Her father disliked being a blacksmith and urged her to continually further her education. Her mother died of tuberculosis on November 3, 1910 when she was still too young to remember much of her mother. She decided to further her education at the Japan Women's University in 1912.Her father died in the middle of February in 1918 at the age of forty-two. In late 1919, she received a visit from Hiratsuka Raich≈ç who asked if she would be interested in co- founding a new organization, the New Women's Association, with the intention of petitioning the 42nd Diet on reforms to Article 5 of the Police Safety Regulations and also a petition to prevent men infected with a venereal disease from marryingFollowing the failure to revise Article 5, Ichikawa left for America, resigning her position as the head of the organization, and Raich≈ç suddenly moved to the foot of Mt. Akagi in the Gumma Prefecture, leaving Oku as the head of the New Women's Association. Finally, on March 25, 1922, Oku Mumeo and the New Women's Association would succeed in revising Article 5 in the last day of the 45th Diet. Oku Mumeo would go on to dissolve the New Women's Associate on December 8, 1922 and form the Women's League on the seventeenth of that same month. With her growing fame in the women's activist circles, she was asked to move to Nakano in order to assist with the Nakano Consumer Union Movement in 1926. Working in the consumer movement she found the area of activist work that would drive her, but she would go on to lead, or at the very least be associated with, various women's activist movements and organizations, such as: the Association of Households, forming the Cooperative Women's Consumer Union, opposing the dissolution of the proletarian parties, and starting women's settlements with the Women's Settlement Movement. =Marriage and children= Oku Mumeo married a man named Oku Eiichi, a poet who never really had much success and was employed in the translation department of Sakai Toshihiko's Baihunsha. She is survived by her son, Kyoichi Oku, and her daughter, Kii Nakamura, who, like her mother before her, served as chairman of the Housewives' Association. =Death and afterward= Oku Mumeo died on July 7, 1997, living to be a hundred and one years old. Due to her numerous contributions to activism in modern Japan, Japanese women are able to run for and hold public office and her Housewives' Association was able to improve the overall quality of life in Japan.

The Wiccan pentacle is now an approved emblem for gravestones under the Veterans Administration, achieved in 2007 following legal action regarding the grave of Wiccan soldier Patrick Stewart. In 2011, the United States Air Force Academy dedicated an $80,000 \\"outdoor worship center\\" for \\"Earth-based religions\\" such as Paganism and traditional Native American religions. As of 2015, there is no provision for official recognition of Wiccan or Pagan chaplains. A broadly neutral depiction of Wicca for a military audience is found in the 1990 version of the Department of the Army's Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains. Demographics Air Force dogtags with \\"Pagan\\" marking The Navy and Army do not track numbers for Wiccans and Pagans, but a 2007 Pentagon count showed over 1,500 self-identified Wiccans in the Air Force and 350 in the Marines. Pagan advocates in 2012 estimated the military's total pagan population at 10,000-20,000, noting that some adherents may not list their affiliation on official forms, and that in the past \\"no preference\\" or \\"other\\" were the only applicable labels available. The Los Angeles times noted in 2011 that only three of the Air Force Academy's 4,300 cadets identified as Pagans. Controversies In 1999, in response to a statement by Representative Bob Barr (R-GA) regarding Wiccan gatherings on military bases, the Free Congress Foundation called for U.S. citizens to not enlist or reenlist in the U.S. Army until the Army terminated the on-base freedoms of religion, speech and assembly for all Wiccan soldiers. Though this movement died a \\"quiet death,\\" on June 24, 1999, then-Governor George W. Bush stated on a television news program, \\"I don‚Äôt think witchcraft is a religion and I wish the military would take another look at this and decide against it.\\"Assortment of links regarding calls to ban Wicca from military establishments: , , , Chaplain Larsen case U.S. Army Chaplain Captain Don Larsen was dismissed from his post in Iraq in 2006 after changing his religious affiliation from Pentecostal Christianity to Wicca and applying to become the first Wiccan military chaplain. His potential new endorser, the Sacred Well Congregation based in Texas, was not yet an officially recognised endorsement organisation for the military, and upon hearing of his conversion, his prior endorser, the Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, immediately revoked its endorsement. At this point, the U.S. Army was required to dismiss him from chaplaincy despite an exemplary service record.

In the two years following, \\"more than a dozen\\" official gravestones received the pentacle.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/us/31religion.html?_r=0 The VA also added the hammer of Thor to the list of approved emblems in May 2013, and the awen in 2017.http://wildhunt.org/2017/01/druid-symbol-approved-for- veteran-headstones.html  Religious Accommodations  In 2018, as a response to the Department of the Army's 2017 ruling to allow the growth of beards in accordance with religious traditions as an exception to Army Regulation 670-1, a soldier assigned to the 795th Military Police Battalion was given authorization to grow a beard in observance of his Heathen faith .

Located on the campus of the University of California, Irvine in Irvine, California, an independent nonprofit corporation was created in 1982, under the leadership of Michael W. Berns, and the actual facility opened on June 4, 1986. It is one of a number of institutions focused on translational research, connecting research and medical applications. Researchers at the institute have developed laser techniques for the manipulation of structures within a living cell, and applied them medically in treatment of skin conditions, stroke, and cancer, among others.  History  Around 1980, Michael W. Berns, a professor of biology at the University of California, Irvine, founded an institute focusing on the then-new technology of lasers. After receiving a National Institutes of Health biotechnology grant, he established a laboratory for laser microscopy, the Laser Microbeam Program (LAMP). He then proposed the creation of an interdisciplinary center which would combine research into lasers and their applications in medical treatment. Berns obtained the support of local philanthropists Arnold O. Beckman (1900-2004) and his wife Mabel (1900-1989). The Beckmans were interested in the potential of the new instruments, and agreed to partner with the university in funding the development of an independent center which would eventually become the property of the university. Beckman presented a $2.5 million matching check to Dan Aldrich, the Chancellor of UCI. Other early supporters of the Beckman Laser Institute included David Packard of Hewlett-Packard, who donated $2 million, SmithKline Beckman Corp. which donated $1 million, and the Irvine Community Foundation. Arnold Beckman and Michael W. Berns were listed as co-founders in the institution's bylaws. The institute was established as an independent nonprofit corporation in 1982, under the leadership of Michael W. Berns. The actual facility opened on June 4, 1986. The current director is Thomas E. Milner Research Early research into the use of lasers included the development of techniques for the manipulation of structures within a living cell. What Bern terms \\"Laser scissors\\" use short pulses of high irradiance to create targeted effects. Optoporation has been used to create tiny openings into the interior of a cell, enabling the genetic manipulation of cells by the insertion and deletion of genes, and the extraction and examination of microplasma from within the cell. Laser ablation can be used to destroy or inactivate cells. Lasers can also be used to optically trap cellular structures. \\"Laser tweezers\\" use continuous, low-irradiance beams that pass through substances without causing damage. The refraction of a pair of symmetric laser light rays within a beam can be modified and cause the target to respond to the change in momentum of the light rays. More advanced research has included optical techniques such as Multiphoton microscopy, Second- harmonic imaging microscopy, Photoacoustic tomography, nonlinear Raman spectroscopy, and diffuse optical spectroscopy. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and second-harmonic generation (SHG) can be used to obtain high-resolution, noninvasive images of thick biological tissues. Researchers are working on the development of small, portable multiphoton systems using femtosecond fiber lasers as a light source, for use in clinical applications and in vivo imaging. Photoacoustic tomography enables researchers to create three- dimensional images of deep tissue. A laser must be carefully tuned to excite specific bonds so that they \\"rattle\\", creating noise that can be detected and mapped by passive acoustic systems. Raman spectroscopy uses Raman scattering of monochromatic light, causing changes in the energy level of a few molecules which then can be detected. Raman spectroscopy and other infrared techniques have been used to detect cancer lesions. Diffuse optical spectroscopy allows researchers to look deep within the body without disturbing tissue. This technique has been used to measure Haemodynamic response within the brain. A beam of near-infrared light is sent through optic fibers resting on the skin, and the scattering of light is measured, allowing researchers to assess the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin within the brain's blood vessels. Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a reflectance technique that models absorption coefficients and reduced scattering coefficients in thick tissue. SFDI can detect subsurface damage to bruised tissues such as the skin or brain by examining hemoglobin levels. It can also be used to assess burn damage. Applications Applications in Biophotonics include the treatment of birthmarks such as Port-wine stain and the removal of tattoos, the detection of bleeding in stroke patients, non-invasive detection of skin cancer and oral lesions, and monitoring of the effects of chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Judge David O. Carter has worked with Michael W. Berns, J. Stuart Nelson and others at the Beckman Laser Institute to develop an innovative program that helps parolees to reintegrate into society by having gang tattoos removed. The removal of visible tattoos on the face, neck and hands increases people's potential to be hired, gaining an income and a sense of purpose.

The club fields five competitive amateur men‚Äôs teams across the two major summer leagues in Minneapolis-St Paul: Stegman's 1977, Stegman's Old Boys, and Stegman's Athletic in the Minnesota Amateur Soccer League (MASL), Stegman's United and Stegman's Blues in the Minnesota Recreational Soccer League (MRSL), and various small-sided teams in various other leagues throughout the year. Additionally, the club is helped to launch and remains affiliated with Minneapolis City SC of the National Premier Soccer League.  History  Stegman's Old Boys FC was founded in 2010 by Dan Hoedeman, Jon Bisswurm and Nick Sindt, quickly expanding to multiple teams competing across the local amateur leagues and divisions. Named for Tom Stegman, the youth coach of the Dayton, Ohio team Centerville Blitz that Hoedeman and Bisswurm played on, Stegman's Old Boys' mascot is a rich, luxuriant mustache. FC Internationals was founded in 1977 and quickly established itself as a powerhouse in Minnesota amateur soccer. Under the management of Franklin Tawah, the Internationals won 13 MASL Division 1 titles, including three in a row from 2003 - 2005, with the 2003 side not dropping a single point on the way to the title, and 8 Minnesota Cups. Keith Kiecker took over manager duties from Tawah and led the team to second in Division 1 and the finals of the Minnesota Cup. In August 2015, Stegman's Old Boys FC and FC Internationals merged to become Stegman‚Äôs Soccer Club. In 2016, with FC Internationals re- named Stegman's 1977, the side did the double, claiming the Division 1 title (for the first time since 2005) and the Minnesota Cup for the first trophies of the new era. As a club, Stegman's almost swept the MASL cups in 2016, but Stegman's Old Boys fell to Haaka FC in extra time in the Wilson Cup final. It was their second Wilson Cup final defeat in three years. The success continued in 2017, with Stegman's 1977 retaining their MASL Division 1 crown and Stegman's Old Boys winning MASL Division 3 while going undefeated. Blues have claimed our most recent trophy, winning MRSL Division 6 in 2019 also going undefeated. Lincoln Community Field in north Minneapolis, home of Stegman's Soccer Club. The club has a barnstorming reputation, regularly traveling out- of-state to take on other amateur clubs. Beginning in 2012, when the Old Boys lost a close battle with Bavarian SC Majors 1-0 in Milwaukee and continuing to 2015 when the Old Boys competed in a home-and-home with FC Fargo, losing the match in Fargo 2-1 on the last kick of the game. The club has started to compete in national amateur tournaments, though Stegman's 1977 were beaten 4-0 in Milwaukee by Bavarian Soccer Club in the 2017 USASA National Cup regional quarterfinal. Stegman's currently fields 5 teams, 1977s (MASL D1), Old Boys (MASL D2), Athletic (MASL D3), United (MRSL D3) and Blues (MRSL D5).  Ownership  Stegman‚Äôs is 100% supporter owned. There are over 50 individual owners of the club, with shareholder eligible to vote on major club decisions, for board members and on management.  Social Responsibility  Uniquely for an amateur club, Stegman‚Äôs is an active supporter of local charities, especially The Sanneh Foundation. The annual Free Beer Night charity friendly, played in 2013, 2014 and 2015 at the National Sports Center in conjunction with a Minnesota United game, has raised over $15,000 for the charity. Additionally, Stegman's has teamed up with other organizations to help The Sanneh Foundation cause, most notably by helping to prepare the Conway Rec Center.  Club Honors  Stegman's 1977 are the club's most decorated team, with 15 MASL Division 1 titles and 9 Minnesota Cup wins. The last major honor won was the 2017 Division 1 title . Citable MASL online records only go back to 1999 and since then Stegman's (Internationals/1977s) has won six Division 1 titles (2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2016, 2017) and seven Minnesota Cups (1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2016)  References   External links  * Category:Association football clubs established in 1977 Category:2015 establishments in Minnesota Category:Sports in Minneapolis Category:Soccer clubs in Minnesota ","title":"Stegman's Soccer Club"},{"id":"48290371","text":"Conus levis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.Bouchet, P.

She was one of the first formally educated female architects in Sweden. She designed residential buildings and schools, and worked on renovation projects for churches. Biography She was born in Oslo as the daughter of shipowner Dagfinn Bugge and Elisabeth W√¶rn. After her parents divorced, she moved with her mother and brother to Gothenburg in 1902, and from there to Stockholm. She graduated her higher secondary education in 1918 with top marks in English, philosophy, Swedish and drawing. =Education= She began studying architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in 1919, after being admitted as a \\"special student\\" since women were not normally admitted to the school at that time. By this time, she had already been practicing architecture for several months at the firm of Folke Bensow and due to her skills began her schooling at the second year class level. She was the fourth woman ever to have been admitted, after Agnes Magnell, Anna Branzell and Signe Christensen. She graduated in 1922. After graduation she travelled to study in Italy, Switzerland and Germany. She received a scholarship for this from Fredrika-Bremer-F√∂rbundet. When she came back to Sweden she worked for several different architects, notably Folke Bensow (1923), Carl Bergsten (1924‚Äì26), Evert Milles (1927) and Karl G√ºettler (1928). 1926-28 she studied architecture at the Royal Institute of Art under professor Ragnar √ñstberg. She was the first woman to attend the course and received the highest grade. She was also the first woman licensed in architecture in Sweden. =Work= In 1929, she started her own architectural firm with another alumna from the Royal Institute of Technology, Kjerstin G√∂ransson-Ljungman. The firm operated until 1936. The two architects were especially concerned with domestic working conditions for women, and were critical of the small kitchens displayed during the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930. Together they published a book on the subject in 1936. The partnership with G√∂ransson-Ljungman ended in 1936, after which W√¶rn Bugge kept running the firm herself. For a while she engaged with questions of the design of domestic homes, and traveled in Sweden to study living conditions on farms. She also taught on the countryside in courses arranged by Fredrika-Bremer-F√∂rbundet and Svenska Sl√∂jdf√∂reningen. In addition, she wrote books and articles. In 1953, Bugge accepted employment at the Building Board in the cultural agency and focused on church restorations and other structures like the Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm. She was a member of a number of societies and organisations. She worked for the United Nations in Paris in 1953, and was a member of the municipal council for Nacka Municipality 1955‚Äì1969. She retired in 1974.

It had a seating capacity of nearly 2500 and is now being used as a church hall. The building with its extravagantly decorated interior is a Grade II* listed building. History In the early 20th century, Woolwich was a thriving industrial and military town. In the mid-1930s there were several smaller movie theatres operating in Woolwich, when two leading companies in the business, Sidney Bernstein's Granada and Oscar Deutsch's Odeon, decided more or less simultaneously to establish large cinemas in the town. The first of the two to open in 1937 was the Granada Cinema; the Odeon opened four months later, just across the road.Saint & Guillery, pp. 74‚Äì76 (online text: pp. 59‚Äì61 ). Granada by this time had a track record for building Britain's most glamorous cinemas. In Woolwich however, Cecil Masey (1881‚Äì1960) and Reginald Uren (1903‚Äì1988) built an outwardly rather severe theatre, but with a lavish interior by Russian-born designer Theodore Komisarjevsky (1882‚Äì1954). The builders, Bovis Ltd, started work in 1936 after the west end of Powis Street had been widened. It opened on 20 April 1937 with Good Morning, Boys and Lady Be Careful. Special guests at the opening ceremony were American actress Glenda Farrell and British comic actor Claude Hulbert.Powell (2013) Initially the Granada Cinema mainly showed ABC or Gaumont films but after ABC built their own Regal Cinema in Woolwich in 1955, the Granada was left to play Gaumont and independent releases. The theatre regularly played host to Christmas pantomimes and musical acts like Buddy Holly in 1958 and Roy Orbison with the Beatles in their famous 1963 tour. The building as a Gala bingo hall By the early 1960s the cinema was already in decline. On weekdays it was used for playing bingo and in 1966 it became a full-time bingo hall. The bingo hall was first operated by Granada and from 1991 until 2011 by Gala. The large Wurlitzer theatre organ, which had been played by Reginald Dixon, was removed in 1996 and sold to the village hall in Tywyn, Wales. In 2011 the building was bought by Christ Faith Tabernacle Churches, a Pentecostal church founded in 1989 by the Nigerian preacher Alfred Williams. Where possible, the interior has been restored meticulously, new doors were made by the same company that made them in 1937, light fittings were commissioned to match the original lights, and new carpets match the 1930s design. The building, now known as the \\"Ebenezer Building\\" or \\"Cathedral\\" of Christ Faith Tabernacle, has been a Grade II listed building since 1973. Since 2000 its status was upgraded to Grade II*. The building =Exterior= The first designs of the Woolwich Granada by Masey had the appearance of a classical movie theatre. After Uren was appointed as co- architect the design became much more modernist and rather Dudok-like. The layout on the awkward plot of land on the junction of Powis Street and Woolwich High Street resulted in what are essentially two joined buildings. The main hall is a brown brick block along Woolwich High Street, for which Masey had intended a relief with the name of the cinema. This part was originally hidden by another building. The elegantly curved asymmetrical front on Powis Street houses the vestibule with the former box office and the foyers, previously with a caf√©-restaurant. Above the main entrance are five tall windows under a canopy and five more narrow windows above the canopy. To the right are five windows in a concrete frame that form a horizontal bar. The advertising tower originally had a full-height appendage that was neon-lit at night. At the top, an open area under a flat roof originally formed part of the illumination.

Together with the Tooting Granada interior, it belongs to the most elaborate purpose- built cinemas in the UK. It has been described as \\"reproducing the style and ambiance of a cathedral, a combination and distillation of Venetian Renaissance and Spanish Gothic, with distinct echoes of the Doge's Palace and the cathedral of Burgos\\".Richards, p. 21. At the time, the Architect & Building News wrote that it had \\"a complexity and lavish exuberance rare even in cinema decoration\\".Architect & Building News, 30 April 1937, p. 135 The opening brochure called it \\"the most romantic theatre ever built\\". The seating capacity in 1937 was 2434. After closing as a cinema, the building was used as a bingo hall and a church, but the interior has been largely preserved. The main stalls and balcony seating, which was removed in the 1960s, was replaced in 2013. Five sets of entrance doors lead into the vestibule, decorated with pilasters. Three sets of doors with wrought-iron bars and cast-iron handles lead into the double-height foyer with galleries on three sides. The foyer has a coffered ceiling, a large central chandelier, four smaller ones and six pairs of wall lights, all in Gothic style. On the far side, a grand staircase leads to the galleries and the balcony seating area. The back wall is entirely panelled with gilded frames with rounded and pointed arches. The four outer bays are decorated with figures painted in Italian Renaissance style, probably by Vladmir Polunin (1880‚Äì1957). The auditorium is also in a style partly based on Medieval and Renaissance architecture. It has elaborate coffered ceilings in red and green and five large chandeliers. The imposing ante-proscenium is divided into three sections, separated by pilasters. The central feature is a monumental Romanesque style arch with jambs made up of seven columns and a tympanum extending up into a pointed gable. The upper stages of the ante- proscenium are made up of Gothic gables and rows of niches and trefoils. Some panels are painted with representations of lions and unicorns (possibly also by Polunin). The balcony foyer (\\"Hall of Mirrors\\") features trefoil-arched mirrors and mirror-faced pilasters on both sides of the elongated space. It has a pitched ceiling with fabric-like decorations in white, red and gold, and a row of French \\"teardrop\\" chandeliers. The balcony is reached through entrances with Gothic panelling, and on the other side, by two vomitories.

It consists of an inner fortress and an outer fortress.\\"Diyarbakƒ±r Kalesi ve Surlarƒ± (Diyarbakƒ±r)\\" . The main gates of the fortress are: Daƒü (Mountain) Gate, Urfa Gate, Mardin Gate and Yeni (New) Gate. The walls come from the old Roman city of Amida and were constructed in their present form in the mid-fourth century AD by the emperor Constantius II. They are the widest and longest complete defensive walls in the world after only the Great Wall of China (the Theodosian Walls for example are longer in length, but are not continuous)\\"Diyarbakƒ±r Surlarƒ±\\" . \\"Surlar\\" . UNESCO added the building to their tentative list on 2000, and listed it as a World Heritage Site in 2015 along with Hevsel Gardens.  Conservation  From 2000 to 2007, begun during the Mayorship of Feridun √áelik, a major restoration of the Fortress' walls was executed. Buildings that were built directly on the wall were removed, the walls were cleaned and a park was given place alongside the walls. Though the walls and fortress itself were once compared to the Great Wall of China, this started to change as wars broke out during 2015; walls from the fortress collapsed, along with a mosque, two churches, and the homes of many civilians, forcing some sections to be abandoned. As the war continued, the government of Turkey and UNESCO jointly began a reconstruction and preservation effort, intending to complete it within two years, starting with the demolition of part of the city. On July 4th 2015, UNESCO added the fortress and Hevsel Gardens Cultural Landscape to UNESCO's World Heritage List. UNESCO's main focus was to protect the environment of the land itself, more than the heritage of the land. The Turkish Prime Minister also spoke of plans to reconstruct the city walls as a great tourist attraction intended to resemble Paris; this provoked considerable controversy in Diyarbakƒ±r, with some locals arguing that they would lose their ancient culture heritage.  Architecture  Diyarbakir fortress is constructed with stone, black basalt, and adobe, and has gone through countless renovations; the basalt fortifications are exceptionally durable, one reason why the structure has remained relatively intact for over 2000 years. Diyarbakir fortress is among the best surviving examples of a castle or fort built with a natural feature like a cliffside or body of water on one side as a boundary. The walls have a symbolic function as well as a defensive purpose, with inscriptions on the inner city's walls (the fort) that testify to the city of Diyarbakir's history. Today, Diyarbakir Fortress can be divided into two categories, the bailey and the citadel. In the northeast, the citadel contains the first settlement inside Diyarbakir, and those walls stretch 598 meters long. The bailey houses a tower and the city walls, surrounding the much more urban walled city region of Diyarbakir. Most of these walls are constructed with traditional masonry and construction styles; the towers consist of 2-4 floors and are 4.4 meters thick on the ground floor and get thinner on higher floors. The castle plans reveal the dominance of two different building forms, circular and tetragonal. The walls were divided into five groups, four of which contained the towers around the four main gates, while the fifth contained the citadel towers. It has been found that 65 of the original 82 towers still remain on the outside of the city's walls and 18 of the citadel's towers remain today. Due to cultural differences, the fort has undergone some modifications. The fort was reconstructed, repaired and or heightened over time. However, the overall typology has remained constant in the fort's renovations.  Construction  Diyarbakir fortress was first built in 297 AD by Romans. In 349 AD the walls got significantly expanded under the order of emperor Constantius II. Over the next 1500+ years, these walls were expanded and fortified using volcanic rock from the surrounding region. There are four main gates and 82 watch towers on the walls. The Diyarbakir city walls have an ancient history dating back to the Romans. The towers at Diyarbakir were mainly built by the Romans and later reconstructed by the Ottomans when they took over the city in the 15th and 16th centuries. During the defeat of the Safavids at Diyarbakir, the Ottomans destroyed the walls with the use of cannons and therefore had to be rebuilt. Today, the walls are largely intact, and form a ring around the old city that is over 3 miles in circumference. The walls are over 33 feet high and are about 10-16 feet thick. In 1930 a part of the wall got demolished. They are the widest and longest complete defensive walls in the world after the Great Wall of China.  History  Diyarbakir Fortress was built, used, and rebuilt during the Roman and Ottoman periods, including the Diyarbakir city walls that measure up to 53 meters long. There are both inner and outer walls; the site also has several gates and towers. Included on the walls are about 63 inscriptions from various historical periods including remains from the Hurrians, Medes, Romans, Sassanians, Byzantines, Marwanids (Kurds), Ayyubids (Kurds), and Ottomans. The city is considered to be a ‚Äúmulti-cultural, multi-lingual, and multi-culture character\\" Recently, the war between the Turkish army and Kurdish guerillas has resulted in damage to the fortress and surrounding monuments, disrupting government plans to conserve the historical fortress in hopes of attracting tourists to the Diyarbakir cultural area. About one-third of the historic Old Town was deliberately destroyed by the Turkish state after the clashes ended, irreversibly damaging the ancient city.

Most of the contributing elements are historic commercial buildings and the two oldest are known to have been used as law offices. The eighteen contributing historic buildings range in date from c. 1840 to 1939. Located in the heart of the community, the National Historic District is only a small portion of what is regarded as the historic downtown and is distinguished by the range of styles represented and the landmark quality of the building. Styles range from Greek Revival, Romanesque Revival, Italianate, neo-classical, and Art Deco.Information from the book Opelousas Tales by Carola Lillie Hartley published by Bodemuller, the Printer - Opelousas, LA - in December 2014.

Dietlein/Savoy Building: Located at 133 East Landry Street, this one story brick building, built in 1894, features decorative bands of cast Fleur-de-lis. The building, used as Savoy's Barber Shop for many years, was originally Dietlein Jewelry Store. See story below from the St. Landry Clarion \\"Our popular young fellow-townsman, Mr. Frank J. Dietlein, has opened a neat and well-appointed watch and jewelry store and repair establishment in the new building on Landry Street, recently erected for him, where he will be pleased to serve the public in his line.

A new modern up-to-date brick building will soon grace Landry Street, the principal city thoroughfare. Jacobs News Depot Company recently let out a contract to Thurston McKinney, local contractor, for the erection of a single story brick building on its lots between Shute‚Äôs Drug store and the Veazie Building. Work on the building, which will cost upwards of $6,000 will be started just as soon as material arrives. The Nolan Arcade and the building occupied by White, The Tailor, will be demolished right away.\\" \\"Aaron Jacobs, progressive and thrifty manager of the Jacobs News Depot Company, for sometime past has been figuring on erecting a building on the valuable lot owned by his company and was fully decided to keep abreast of the times. The new building on Landry Street will make the, south side of East Landry more citified than ever; there will be only three old buildings on the block and it is expected that those will in the near future be torn down to be replaced with modern and up-to-date buildings.\\" \\"Jacobs announced during the week that he would divide his building into two stores, one portion will be occupied by the company and the other has already been leased for the next five years to parties, whose identity Mr. Jacobs would not reveal.\\" 11\\\\. Shute's Building: Built in 1924, this two story brick building located on the corner of Court and Landry streets, has cast cement trim accenting the windows.

May is an American author. He is best known for his five books: The Elegant Solution, In Pursuit of Elegance, The Shibumi Strategy, The Laws of Subtraction, and Winning the Brain Game: Fixing the 7 Fatal Flaws of Thinking.  Education  May graduated with a BA from Johns Hopkins University in 1981, and from the Wharton School of Business in 1985 with an MBA.  The Elegant Solution  In 2007, May published the book The Elegant Solution: Toyota's Formula for Mastering Innovation. The book is based upon the lessons May learned as a consultant at University of Toyota, specifically as the company was making an effort to export the principles of its Toyota Production System to other areas of the company. From this experience, May has stated there are 3 principles (the art of ingenuity; the pursuit of perfection; and the rhythm of fit) and 10 practices that set Toyota apart from its competitors. Katherine Radeka reviewed the work, writing that, ‚ÄúRather than copy Toyota‚Äôs activities, May seems to ask his readers to internalize the underlying thoughts and then to develop their own activities.‚Äù  In Pursuit of Elegance  In 2009, May followed up his first book with the work In Pursuit of Elegance: Why the Best Ideas Have Something Missing. This work distills ‚Äúelegance‚Äù as the chief goal and principle that should be sought in business operations. May further distills elegance down to the sub-principles of Symmetry, Seduction, Subtraction, and Sustainability. The book focuses on a business audience, seeking to address business solutions specifically with his principles. Oliver Ho reviewed the work, writing that in the book May had, ‚Äúan interesting sense of synthesis and ability to find connections across various fields, from pop culture to fine arts, science to sports.‚Äù  The Shibumi Strategy  In 2010, May published the book The Shibumi Strategy: A Powerful Way to Create Meaningful Change. In May‚Äôs book, writes of zen principles such as kanso and koko, and how they help Japanese business executives to arrive at simpler and more elegant solutions than many of their Western counterparts. The book advocates the implementation of Japanese aesthetics into Western life, and the seeking of an even-minded and peaceful response to work stress. The title of the book comes from an untranslatable Japanese concept shibui, referring to something approximately ‚Äúthe height of personal excellence and total clarity‚Äù. May separates the steps to approaching this strategy as: commitment, preparation, struggle, breakthrough and transformation.  The Laws of Subtraction  In 2012, May published the book The Laws of Subtraction: 6 Simple Rules for Winning in the Age of Excess Everything. Max Nisen described the book as, ‚ÄúMay and a series of business executives, creatives, and thought leaders‚Äù focusing on the ‚Äúability to simplify and remove complexity, rather than just adding more.‚Äù May‚Äôs six laws break down the concept into a methodology to be used in management or development environments. The book is an extension of the principle of Subtraction as found in his book In Pursuit of Elegance.  Winning the Brain Game  In 2016, May published the book Winning the Brain Game: Fixing the 7 Fatal Flaws of Thinking. The book is based on May‚Äôs fieldwork over a 10-year period in which he gave over 100,000 business professionals a simple thought exercise, based on a real case far less complex that their routine business problems. Less than 5% arrived at the solution. May not only catalogues his observations into seven primary cognition patterns he calls ‚Äúflaws,\\" but also calls on modern neuropsychology to explain the brain functions causing the flaws. He then enlists the guidance of renowned thinkers to offer practical techniques to neutralize the flaws.  Other work  May is a contributor to a number of newspapers, reviews, and magazines. He is a winner of the New Yorker Magazine Cartoon Caption Contest.

The station opened in 1853, but sources differ on when it closed. Dow is insistent that it closed in the 1870s and was converted into an Emigrants' Home, Butt supports this with a date of 1879 and Anderson gives 1880. Croughton claims it closed at the outbreak of the First World War, whilst a reply to an enquiry to The Railway Magazine implied the station closed at the outbreak of The Second World War. OS Maps corroborate the first three. Boat trains undoubtedly continued to run to the quayside at Grimsby up to 1939, but a station, as such, at the pier was not needed. Passengers were assisted off trains and escorted direct to adjacent ships and vice versa, much as at Immingham Eastern Jetty. As the conversion of the station to an Emigrants' Home suggests, the erstwhile Pier Station was used as transit accommodation for people making their way to the New World, typically arriving from Europe by ship then travelling via the GCR to Liverpool for final embarkation. The station was accessed via a spur from Grimsby Docks station. The substantial building survived until at least 1960 but by 2015 no trace remained. Services The station was used by Great Central Railway emigrant trains to Liverpool and boat trains across the North Sea, principally to Hamburg.

Description The blue-spotted pipefish is a small-sized fish that can reach a maximum length of 16 cm. Its head is in the continuity of the body. The snout is tapered and have a medium length. The body has a somewhat angular appearance due to the presence of four discontinuous longitudinal ridges distributed over the dorsal and ventral side. The caudal fin is small and narrow. The body coloration may range from yellow to light brown through almost black. The color can be plain, spotted or mottled with white, yellow or light blue. The dorsal fin is usually whitish with 3-4 small brownish spots on each of its 20-28 rays. Distribution & habitat The blue-spotted pipefish is widespread throughout the tropical, subtropical and temperate waters of the Indo-Pacific from the eastern coast of Africa, Red Sea included, to Fidji and Philippines and from south Japan to north coast of Australia). The blue-spotted pipefish likes the shallow waters of estuaries from small coastal rivers and mangrove area. Biology The bluespeckled pipefish feeds on planktonic crustacean. It is ovoviviparous and it is the male who broods the eggs in its ventral brood pouch. The latter includes villi rich in capillaries that surround each fertilized egg creating a sort of placenta supplying the embryos. When fully grown, pups will be expelled from the pocket and evolve in complete autonomy.

After initial training, the battery sailed to England, arriving in Liverpool on 18 October 1943. Based at Benham Valence, Berkshire, England, the battalion conducted additional training in preparation for Operation Overlord. Battery A parachuted into Normandy on 6 June 1944. Most of the battery initially fought as infantrymen due to the loss of their howitzers. On 7 June 1944, 33 artillerymen from the battery, under the command of Lt Thomas Swirczynski captured 130 Germans near Hau-des-dunes. Other artillerymen from the battery served with other artillery units, manning salvaged US pieces and even captured German howitzers. By 14 June 1944, the battery was consolidated and re-armed with new howitzers landed over the Normandy beaches. The battery conducted a second parachute assault on 19 September 1944. After landing and firing in support of the 1/506th PIR and 502nd PIR, the battery occupied near St Oedenrode, supporting the 501st PIR and 502nd PIR.

The fort is similar to the related Questel Fort.  History  This stronghold, built because Louis XVI of France wanted to make Brest impregnable, was the most important link in the defense of the city's west side, designed for 500-600 soldiers. This fort was used by the Germans in 1944, who installed an elite paratrooper unit (The Fallschirmj√§ger) during the siege of Brest by the Americans. After many assaults and heavy use of tanks and flamethrowers as well as the use of two tonnes of TNT the wall fell, after the allies cleared out the final German resistance the garrison surrendered on 16 September 1944. Rebuilt after World War II, during the Cold War Fort Montbarey hosted the DCA (Defense Against Aircraft) command center of the port of Brest and had in its yard two large bunkers. It also had, at this time, a search radar for aircraft. These facilities were decommissioned in the late 1960s. In 1984 Fort Montbarey was developed by the Navy into a museum on the history of Finist√®re during the Second World War, featuring the Resistance effort. An exhibition on \\"Brest in ruins\\" is also presented, as well as a \\"wagon of death\\" used in the Holocaust and many American vehicles and parts from the DCA (Defence Against Aviation) era, and a British Churchill tank. The museum also manages over 10,000 files and documents on the Resistance, and records on soldiers and victims of the Second World War. It annually hosts more than 10,000 visitors.

The episode was written by Angela Kang and directed by Michael Slovis. The episode takes place directly after the ending of the season premiere, and is shown from the perspective of survivors dealing with an incoming herd coming in their direction, primarily focusing on Glenn Rhee and Michonne. This episode marks the death and final regular appearance of recurring character, Nicholas (Michael Traynor). The indefinite fate of Glenn was highlighted by several critics. Plot Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun), Michonne (Danai Gurira) and others race towards Alexandria as the horn draws the rear half of the walker parade towards the town. Rick orders Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) to continue leading the rest of the herd away from Alexandria, as part of his plan. When the horn stops, Rick decides to circle back for an RV, improvising to draw the breakaway herd back to the route he'd planned. He instructs Glenn and Michonne to lead the group back home, to not stop or fight anything on their way, and to keep moving. He tells them to try to save everyone, but if they cannot, leave some behind to ensure that they keep moving; this is overheard by Heath (Corey Hawkins). While Rick has stopped the group to give these instructions, however, one Alexandrian is caught by a walker and killed. Daryl ignores Rick's plan and leaves Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) and Sasha Williams (Sonequa Martin-Green) to lead the herd by themselves. Michonne and Glenn's group suffer attrition as Annie (Beth Keener) twists her ankle, and in a fight with walkers, David (Jay Huguley) is bitten in the shoulder, whilst Sturgess (Jonathan Kleitman) panics and shoots Scott (Kenric Green) in the leg before running off. Though slowed by two wounded and encountering additional walkers, Michonne and Glenn refuse to leave anyone behind despite Rick's orders. The group finds Sturgess' hat. Barely keeping it together, Nicholas (Michael Traynor) leads them through familiar territory to shelter in a pet store. The group finds Sturgess' dead body being devoured by a group of walkers. Glenn devises a plan to light one of the buildings on fire to distract the undead, and Nicholas offers to lead him to a feed store. Annie and Scott suggest they be left behind, but Heath insists otherwise and glares at Michonne. When Michonne confronts Heath about his attitude, the latter tells her that he overheard what Rick said, while the former counters by saying they have not left anyone behind and defends Rick's brutal attitude by telling Heath that he has not experienced what Rick has. Newlywed David, knowing he is going to die, writes a farewell note to his wife Betsy, but Michonne refuses to carry it for him and assures him that he can make it home for a final goodbye. Michonne dispatches two walkers that were hidden inside the pet store, the noise from which draws the herd to their location. They are forced to flee, though without Glenn and Nicholas they don't have enough able-bodied people to help the injured. Annie trips on an improvised crutch and falls, urging the others to run moments before she is devoured by walkers. David is eaten alive against a gate, dropping his note to Betsy. Michonne and Heath, carrying Scott between them, manage to escape the town and arrive in Alexandria which they find has been attacked. Glenn and Nicholas discover the feed store had already been burned down. Nicholas tries to lead them away but they find themselves surrounded and trapped in a dead end, where they desperately climb a dumpster to avoid the clutches of the walkers. Nicholas calms himself and thanks Glenn before shooting himself in the head. Glenn falls with him into the mass of walkers, and Glenn screams in anguish as bloody viscera are torn out of Nicholas‚Äô chest, meant to trick the viewer into thinking Glenn has died. Rick arrives at the RV, which he drives to another location in hopes of single-handedly intercepting the herd and salvaging his failed plan. He radios Daryl with his intentions, but he is ambushed by the Wolves that Morgan Jones (Lennie James) had convinced to flee Alexandria. Rick kills all five Wolves and finds one of them had a jar of baby food from Alexandria. As walkers approach, Rick is unable to start the shot-up RV which becomes surrounded by an increasing number of walkers. Production Michael Slovis directed the episode. The episode was directed by Michael Slovis and written by Angela Kang.

Showrunner Scott M. Gimple made the statement, \\"We will see Glenn, some version of Glenn or parts of Glenn, again, either in flashback or in the current timeline. We will complete the story.

Guitarist Alex Henery later revealed it was due to vocalist Andrew Fisher wishing to become a certified teacher which required him to return to school for a period of a year and a half. Drummer James Fisher, Andrew's younger brother, was graduating from art school, and the rest of the members were working on their respective careers. Henery, meanwhile, was working as a videographer in Boston, Massachusetts for record label Run for Cover.Biddulph 2016, p. 77 In late January 2014, the group announced that they would be returning from their hiatus and would perform shows during the summer. The band recorded an EP, Further Sky, in secret before releasing it in July. Production In August 2014, Henery revealed the group was writing material for a new album. Although Henery was located in the US and the rest of the band was in the UK, they would send each other ideas. The group managed to have a few practice sessions before composing the album. Henry found it \\"a little tough\\", but the group managed to \\"[make] it work\\". In early April 2015, the band posted they had begun recording with producer Sam Pura. Recording took place at Assault and Battery 2 in England, while mixing would later be done by Pura at the Panda Studios in California. Brian Gardener mastered the recordings. The album's sound has been described as alternative rock, compared to American bands such as Jimmy Eat World, Failure, and Soundgarden. Henery later named American band Autolux as \\"the biggest influence\\" on the record as \\"they just had energy and had that distortion, but still had really cool melodies.\\" Release On 19 October 2015, Basement's third album, Promise Everything, was announced for release and the artwork was revealed, which was done by R.V.

(Johannes) Swinkels (1851‚Äì1950) was an important person of the Dutch brewing industry. He was the fourth generation of Swinkels family running a brewery in the Dutch village of Lieshout, North Brabant. When he took over the brewery in 1884 he started its transformation from a local brewery into a worldwide but still family owned company with annual production of five hundred million litres of beer. Nowadays Bavaria is the second largest brewery in the Netherlands and Johannes is considered to be the founding father of its present-day success. Johannes was actually the first brewer in Lieshout who fully focused on the brewing business only when his ancestors always split their professional capacities in between brewery and agriculture given the favourable location of Lieshout surroundings.  Early life  J. F. Swinkels was born on November 2, 1851 in Lieshout, North Brabant. His mother was Petronella Donkers (1809‚Äì1897) and his father was Franciscus Swinkels (1798‚Äì1867), son of Brigitta Swinkels and Embertus Swinkels, and the third generation of Swinkels brewery family. Johannes (also called Jan in the family) had brothers Carel (1842‚Äì1897) and Janus (1855‚Äì1935). Both his brothers were keen on brewing industry as well when Carel founded his brewery Het Anker (Anchor) in city of Gemert, Netherlands, and Janus had a brewery De Zwaan.  Brewing innovations  Johannes took over the brewery from his parents, Franciscus and Petronella Swinkels in 1884 and almost immediately expanded brewery's service to the industrial town of Helmond (10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Lieshout) which resulted in big sales increase from 988 hectolitres of beer in 1890 to 1,900 hectolitres in 1900. He also set up future Bavaria catering portfolio via purchase of a caf√© in Helmond in 1889. After 1907 he started with product range expansion to meet new consumer preferences. Due to sales increase as well as political situation Johannes started to search the world for new brewing methods and the ingredients of the highest quality. Purchases of ship loads of malt ensured the supply of raw materials and helped the brewery survive through World War I, when many small local Dutch breweries were forced to shut down. Another reason why he managed so well during World War I is fact that he temporarily used the malt plant as vegetable drying unit After the First World War distribution was further expanded to other towns and villages in North Brabant. By 1923 output had increased to 3,325 hectolitres of beer per year and the original brewery buildings had become too small. Thus, in 1924 Johannes built a new brewhouse where the new bottom fermented beer was brewed. At that time rarely used \\"Brewing\\" enabled him to produce lighter \\"Pilsener type\\" beer with distinctive fresh taste. Hereby he found the worldwide expansion of the brewery and established worldwide known brand ‚Äì Bavaria Brewery (Netherlands). Johannes has turned the business over to his sons Jan, Frans and Piet in 1925 but until his death in 1950 he still oversaw the operation of the family business.  Personal life  In 1884 Johannes married Cornelia Anna Verstappen. Cornelia was a farmer's daughter and helped her husband with all administrative and financial matters. She was a brisk woman and it is believed that she had a quite influence on her husband and definitely at least partly on her instigation Johannes expanded the brewery services. Cornelia had an influence on Johannes and definitely at least partly on her instigation Johannes expanded brewery's service are to the industrial town of Helmond which resulted in big sales increase. The marriage with Cornelia gave to Johannes three sons ‚Äì Frans (1896‚Äì1979), Piet (1899‚Äì1969) and Jan (1905‚Äì1999). All his sons continued with family brewery business which brought growth in sales of this family business and remained faithful to this brewery until their death. Johannes was together with his wife active in Lieshout's community life to a grand old age.

The element x_i represents the amount of good i in the bundle. * \\\\overrightarrow{w} is a vector of size m that represents the subjective preferences of the consumer. The element w_i represents the relative value that the consumer assigns to good i. If w_i=0, this means that the consumer thinks that product i is totally worthless. The higher w_i is, the more valuable a unit of this product is for the consumer. A consumer with a linear utility function has the following properties: * The preferences are strictly monotone: having a larger quantity of even a single good strictly increases the utility. * The preferences are weakly convex, but not strictly convex: a mix of two equivalent bundles is equivalent to the original bundles, but not better than it. * The marginal rate of substitution of all goods is constant. For every two goods i,j: ::MRS_{i,j} = w_i/w_j . * The indifference curves are straight lines (when there are two goods) or hyperplanes (when there are more goods). * Each demand curve (demand as a function of price) is a step function: the consumer wants to buy zero units of a good whose utility/price ratio is below the maximum, and wants to buy as many units as possible of a good whose utility/price ratio is maximum. * The consumer regards the goods as perfect substitute goods.  Economy with linear utilities  Define a linear economy as an exchange economy in which all agents have linear utility functions. A linear economy has several properties. Assume that each agent A has an initial endowment \\\\overrightarrow{e_A}. This is a vector of size m in which the element e_{A,i} represents the amount of good i that is initially owned by agent A. Then, the initial utility of this agent is \\\\overrightarrow{w_A}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{e_A}. Suppose that the market prices are represented by a vector \\\\overrightarrow{p} \\\\- a vector of size m in which the elementp_i is the price of good i. Then, the budget of agent A is \\\\overrightarrow{p}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{e_A}. While this price vector is in effect, the agent can afford all and only the bundles \\\\overrightarrow{x} that satisfy the budget constraint: \\\\overrightarrow{p}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{x} \\\\leq \\\\overrightarrow{p}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{e_A}.  Competitive equilibrium  A competitive equilibrium is a price vector and an allocation in which the demands of all agents are satisfied (the demand of each good equals its supply). In a linear economy, it consists of a price vector \\\\overrightarrow{p} and an allocation X, giving each agent a bundle \\\\overrightarrow{x_A} such that: * \\\\sum_A{\\\\overrightarrow{x_A}} = \\\\sum_A{\\\\overrightarrow{e_A}} (the total amount of all goods is the same as in the initial allocation; no goods are produced or destroyed). * For every agent A, its allocation \\\\overrightarrow{x_A} maximizes the utility of the agent, \\\\overrightarrow{w_A}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{x}, subject to the budget constraint \\\\overrightarrow{p}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{x} \\\\leq \\\\overrightarrow{p}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{e_A}. In equilibrium, each agent holds only goods for which his utility/price ratio is weakly maximal. I.e, if agent A holds good i in equilibrium, then for every other good j: ::w_{A,i} / p_i \\\\geq w_{A,j} / p_j (otherwise, the agent would want to exchange some quantity of good i with good j, thus breaking the equilibrium). Without loss of generality, it is possible to assume that every good is desired by at least one agent (otherwise, this good can be ignored for all practical purposes). Under this assumption, an equilibrium price of a good must be strictly positive (otherwise the demand would be infinite).  Existence of competitive equilibrium  David Gale proved necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a competitive equilibrium in a linear economy. He also proved several other properties of linear economies. A set S of agents is called self-sufficient if all members of S assign a positive value only for goods that are owned exclusively by members of S (in other words, they assign value w_i=0 to any product i which is owned by members outside S). The set S is called super-self-sufficient if someone in S owns a good which is not valued by any member of S (including himself). Gale's existence theorem says that: ::A linear economy has a competitive equilibrium if and only if no set of agents is super-self- sufficient. Proof of \\"only if\\" direction: Suppose the economy is in equilibrium with price \\\\overrightarrow{p} and allocation x. Suppose S is a self-sufficient set of agents. Then, all members of S trade only with each other, because the goods owned by other agents are worthless for them. Hence, the equilibrium allocation satisfies: ::\\\\sum_{A\\\\in S}{\\\\overrightarrow{x_A}} = \\\\sum_{A\\\\in S}{\\\\overrightarrow{e_A}}. Every equilibrium allocation is Pareto efficient. This means that, in the equilibrium allocation x, every good is held only by an agent which assigns positive value to that good. By the equality just mentioned, for each good i, the total amount of i held by members of S in the equilibrium allocation x equals the total amount of i held by members of S in the initial allocation e. Hence, in the initial allocation e, every good is held by a member of S, only if it is valuable to one or more members of S. Hence, S is not super-self-sufficient.  Competitive equilibrium with equal incomes  Competitive equilibrium with equal incomes (CEEI) is a special kind of competitive equilibrium, in which the budget of all agents is the same. I.e, for every two agents A and B: ::\\\\overrightarrow{p}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{x_A} = \\\\overrightarrow{p}\\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{x_B} The CEEI allocation is important because it is guaranteed to be envy-free: the bundle x_A gives agent A a maximum utility among of all the bundles with the same price, so in particular it gives him at least as much utility as the bundle x_B. One way to achieve a CEEI is to give all agents the same initial endowment, i.e., for every A and B: ::\\\\overrightarrow{e_A} = \\\\overrightarrow{e_B} (if there are n agents then every agent receives exactly 1/n of the quantity of every good). In such an allocation, no subsets of agents are self-sufficient. Hence, as a corollary of Gale's theorem: ::In a linear economy, a CEEI always exists. = Examples = In all examples below, there are two agents - Alice and George, and two goods - apples (x) and guavas (y). A. Unique equilibrium: the utility functions are: :u_A(x,y)=3x+2y, :u_G(x,y)=2x+3y. The total endowment is T=(6,6). Without loss of generality, we can normalize the price vector such that P_x=1. What values can P_y have in CE? If P_y>3/2, then both agents want to give all their y for x; if P_y<2/3, then both agents want to give all their x for y; hence, in CE 2/3 \\\\leq P_y \\\\leq 3/2. If P_y=2/3, then Alice is indifferent between x and y, while George wants only y. Similarly, if P_y=3/2, then George is indifferent while Alice wants only x. If 2/3 < P_y < 3/2, then Alice wants only x while George wants only y. Hence, the CE allocation must be [(6,0);(0,6)]. The price vector depends on the initial allocation. E.g., if the initial allocation is equal, [(3,3);(3,3)], then both agents have the same budget in CE, so P_y=P_x=1. This CE is essentially unique: the price vector may be multiplied by a constant factor, but the CE equilibrium will not change. B. No equilibrium: Suppose Alice holds apples and guavas but wants only apples. George holds only guavas but wants both apples and guavas. The set {Alice} is self-sufficient, because Alice thinks that all goods held by George are worthless. Moreover, the set {Alice} is super-self-sufficient, because Alice holds guavas which are worthless to her. Indeed, a competitive equilibrium does not exist: regardless of the price, Alice would like to give all her guavas for apples, but George has no apples so her demand will remain unfulfilled. C. Many equilibria: Suppose there are two goods and two agents, both agents assign the same value to both goods (e.g. for both of them, w_{apples}=w_{guavas}=1). Then, in equilibrium, the agents may exchange some apples for an equal number of guavas, and the result will still be an equilibrium. For example, if there is an equilibrium in which Alice holds 4 apples and 2 guavas and George holds 5 apples and 3 guavas, then the situation in which Alice holds 5 apples and 1 guava and George 4 apples and 4 guavas is also an equilibrium. But, in both these equilibria, the total utilities of both agents are the same: Alice has utility 6 in both equilibria, and George has utility 8 in both equilibria. This is not a coincidence, as shown in the following section.  Uniqueness of utilities in competitive equilibrium  Gale proved that: ::In a linear economy, all agents are indifferent between all the equilibria. Proof. The proof is by induction on the number of traders. When there is only a single trader, the claim is obvious. Suppose there are two or more traders and consider two equilibria: equilibrium X with price vector \\\\overrightarrow{p} and allocation x, and equilibrium Y with price vector \\\\overrightarrow{q} and allocation y. There are two cases to consider: a. The price vectors are the same up to multiplicative constant: \\\\overrightarrow{p}=C \\\\cdot \\\\overrightarrow{q} for some constant C. This means that in both equilibria, all agents have exactly the same budget set (they can afford exactly the same bundles). In equilibrium, the utility of every agent is the maximum utility of a bundle in the budget set; if the budget set is the same, then so is the maximum utility in that set. b. The price vectors are not proportional. This means that the price of some goods changed more than others. Define the highest price-rise as: ::M := \\\\max_i{q_i/p_i} and define the highest price-rise goods as those good/s that experienced the maximum price change (this must be a proper subset of all goods since the price- vectors are not proportional): ::H := \\\\\\\\{i  q_i/p_i=M\\\\\\\\} and define the highest price-rise holders as those trader/s that hold one or more of those maximum-price-change-goods in Equilibrium Y: ::S := \\\\\\\\{A  y_{A,i}>0 \\\\text{ for some } i\\\\in H\\\\\\\\} In equilibrium, agents hold only goods whose utility/price ratio is weakly maximal. So for all agents in S, the utility/price ratio of all goods in H is weakly maximal under the price vector \\\\overrightarrow{q}. Since the goods in H experienced the highest price-rise, when the price vector is \\\\overrightarrow{p} their utility/price ratio is strongly maximal. Hence, in Equilibrium X, all agents in S hold only goods from H. In equilibrium X, someone must hold goods that are not in H; hence, S must be a proper subset of the agents. So in equilibrium X, the S-agents hold only H-goods, and in equilibrium Y, S-agents hold all the H-goods. This allows us to do some budget calculations: On one hand, in equilibrium X with price \\\\overrightarrow{p}, the S-agents spend all their budget on H-goods, so: ::\\\\overrightarrow{p}\\\\cdot \\\\sum_{A\\\\in S}{\\\\overrightarrow{e_A}} \\\\leq \\\\sum_{i\\\\in H}{p_i\\\\cdot\\\\overrightarrow{e_i}} (where \\\\overrightarrow{e_i} is the total initial endowment from good i). On the other hand, in equilibrium Y with price \\\\overrightarrow{q}, the S-agents can afford all the H-goods, so: ::\\\\overrightarrow{q}\\\\cdot \\\\sum_{A\\\\in S}{\\\\overrightarrow{e_A}} \\\\geq \\\\sum_{i\\\\in H}{q_i\\\\cdot\\\\overrightarrow{e_i}} Combining these equations leads to the conclusion that, in both equilibria, the S-agents only trade with each other: ::\\\\sum_{A\\\\in S}{y_A}=\\\\sum_{A\\\\in S}{x_A}=\\\\sum_{A\\\\in S}{e_A}. Hence, the agents not in S also only trade with each other. This means that equilibrium X is composed of two equilibria: one that involves only S-agents and H-goods, and the other that involves only non-S-agents and non-H-goods. The same is true for agent Y. Since S is a proper subset of the agents, the induction assumption can be invoked and the theorem is proved.  Calculating competitive equilibrium  Eaves presented an algorithm for finding a competitive equilibrium in a finite number of steps, when such an equilibrium exists.  Related concepts  Linear utilities functions are a small subset of Quasilinear utility functions. Goods with linear utilities are a special case of substitute goods. Suppose the set of goods is not finite but continuous. E.g., the commodity is a heterogeneous resource, such as land. Then, the utility functions are not functions of a finite number of variables, but rather set functions defined on Borel subsets of the land. The natural generalization of a linear utility function to that model is an additive set function. This is the common case in the theory of fair cake-cutting. An extension of Gale's result to this setting is given by Weller's theorem. Under certain conditions, an ordinal preference relation can be represented by a linear and continuous utility function.

Pavlov (–ò–≤–∞–Ω –Æ—Ä—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤, born 1971 in St. Petersburg, Soviet Union) is a Russian lawyer and open government activist. Participated in development of the Russian federal and regional freedom of information legislation. Specializes in protecting the right to access to governmental information in Russia, and defending citizens from ungrounded accusations of disclosing state secrets, high treason, and espionage. Also focuses on raising public awareness regarding the need for modern legislation on state secrets and the use of current legislation as a means of repression.  Biography  In 1997, Pavlov received his J.D. degree from St. Petersburg State University, and was admitted to the Russian defense bar. Pavlov received his Candidate of Law Science degree (Ph.D.) in 2009 from the Institute of State and Law, Russian Academy of Sciences. From 1998-2004, Ivan Pavlov headed the Environmental Human Rights Center Bellona (St.-Petersburg, Russia).  FOI initiatives  In 2004, Ivan Pavlov founded the Foundation ‚ÄúInstitute for Information Freedom Development‚Äù, or Freedom of Information Foundation (FIF). For ten years, FIF rendered legal assistance to citizens and organizations, defending their rights to information access. FIF specialists also audited government bodies' official websites for compliance with actual FOI legislation requirements. In 2014, FIF was included in the state register of \\"foreign agent\\" NGOs. After a series of court hearings when Ivan Pavlov and other lawyers of the FIF contested the \\"foreign agent\\" status, the Freedom of Information Foundation formally suspended its activities. However, the work has not ceased. Several ex-FIF staff members, leading by Pavlov, are now joined by Team 29, the only Russian non-governmental initiative performing professional defense of the citizens‚Äô right to freely look for, receive, transmit, produce, and distribute information by legal means. Team 29 is working in a new format for Russia without creating a legal entity ‚Äì as a free partnership of lawyers, journalists, and civil activists.  Team 29  In 2015, Ivan Pavlov became leader of the Team 29, an informal association of lawyers and journalists. After suspension of the FIF activities, some of its team (lawyers and journalists), led by Pavlov, continued working in a new format. Since February 2015, the Team 29 protects citizens‚Äô rights to information in courts and performs public outreach activities, publishing materials on governmental closeness and legal advice for citizens at the Team 29 website.  High-profile cases  = Access to information =  Access to texts of national standards  In 2006, Ivan Pavlov initiated a court case that resulted in a judicial obligation for the Federal Agency for Technical Regulation and Metrology (Rostechregulirovanie, its brief name was then) to publish texts of national standards online. Before that, the wide public could get access to the standards only for fee. FIF lawyers won their victory in the first court instance in February 2006. The Rostechregulirovanie filed a cassation appeal. Its hearing was scheduled for May 23, 2006, but the federal agency's officials did not attend the court then. The hearing session was adjourned up to June 8. Meanwhile, on May 31, 2006, Ivan Pavlov was assaulted and taken off to hospital with head injuries. Since the assaulters took none of his personal belongings, Pavlov links the assault with his professional activities, namely with the case on open online access to national standards. The criminal case was initiated but the criminals are not yet found.  Contesting of the presidential decree on classification of information on military personnel losses in the time of peace  In 2015 lawyers of the Team 29, led by Pavlov, prepared a claim against President Putin's Decree classifying information on military personnel losses within special operations in the time of peace. The claim is supported by well-known human rights activists and journalists also realizing that the Decree will help the state authorities to suppress and attempts to cover the situation at the Ukrainian South-East. The applicants argued that Putin had exceeded his powers by classifying information about military losses (Russia's Constitution clearly states that the constitutional right to freely seek, receive and circulate information can only be restricted by federal law). On August 13, 2015, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation has ruled that the Decree is legal. The ruling gives the grounds to apply to the Constitutional Court and force a proper assessment of how information in Russia is classified as state secret. = Defense of citizens persecuted by state security bodies = For more than 20 years, Ivan Pavlov has been defending rights of citizens charged by state security bodies of high treason, unlawful access to security bodies‚Äô secret archives, or state secret disclosure. According to statistical data of the Judicial Department under the Supreme Court of Russia, during the period from 2010 to the first half of 2017, sentences were given for 57 cases on Article 275 of the Criminal Code of Russia (high treason), 11 cases on Article 206 (espionage), and 137 cases on Article 283 (state secret disclosure). Zoya Svetova, a Russian human rights journalist, defines the current state of affairs as immersion of Russia by ‚Äúspy mania‚Äù.  High treason cases  = The Alexander Nikitin case = Ivan Pavlov defended Alexander Nikitin, an environmentalist accused of high treason for having prepared a research report The Northern Fleet: A Potential Radioactive Contamination Threat for the Region. Nikitin was detained from February to December 1996; his case was widely covered by media, NGOs, and political organizations of Russia and Europe[17]. Amnesty International recognized Nikitin as a prisoner of conscience. In 1998, the court sent back the case for further investigation[19]. In 2000, Nikitin was fully acquitted by the Supreme Court of Russia. = The Grigory Pasko case = Pavlov also represented in court interests of Grigory Pasko, a military journalist arrested in 1997 and accused of high treason (Article 275). They said that when the journalist had been going to travel by air from Russia to Japan, some documents had been withdrawn from him and their preliminary study had shown that they had contained information comprising state secret. The Amnesty International recognized Pasko, too, as a prisoner of conscience. In 1999, the military court of the Pacific Fleet sentenced Pasko to a year of imprisonment for abuse of official powers and immediately included in the amnesty and released from the court room. In 2000, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of Russia canceled Pasko's sentence and the case was sent back for re-examination. On December 25, 2001, the military court of the Pacific Fleet found Pasko guilty of high treason in the form of espionage and sentenced him to four years of imprisonment. Having stayed in a penal colony for more than half a year, Pasko was released on parole. = The Svetlana Davydova case = Ivan Pavlov rendered legal defense to Svetlana Davydova, a mother of many children, who had been accused of high treason for a phone call to the Ukrainian embassy. Davydova became the very first one accused in accordance with the new provisions of the Article 275 (approved in 2012) stating that any assistance to a foreign state or organization, or to its representative, in activities aimed against security of the Russian state, is considered as high treason. The Davydova case is the first known face of accusation of espionage in favor of Ukraine since beginning of the military conflict in the east of Ukraine. According to the investigation, in April 2014, Svetlana Davydova noticed that a military unit placed near her home was empty. Later, she heard how a serviceman from that military unit told that he and his comrades-in-arms were sent on a mission. Davydova informed the Ukrainian embassy on that. Eightr months later, on January 21, 2015, she was arrested by an FSB operational group. On February 1, 2015, Davydova dismissed her assigned counsel and replaced him to Ivan Pavlov and Sergey Badamshin. After entrance of independent defending attorneys in her case, she withdrew her previous testimony, explaining that she had made it under pressure. On March 13, 2015, Davydova's attorneys informed that the criminal case against her was terminated due to absence of crime. The Gennady Kravtsov case In May 2014, Gennady Kravtsov, ex-officer of the Main Intelligence Directorate, was detained in Moscow upon suspicion of high treason. He left the service in the Main Intelligence Directorate in 2005 and had a foreign travel passport since 2011. The FSB public relations center informed that the case was initiated because Kravtsov had been supposed some information on Russian space intelligence activities to email to the radio engineering center of the Swedish ministry for defense. Kravtsov's wife, meanwhile, stated that he submitted a job resume to a Swedish organization and it was rejected since he was not a Swedish citizen. Kravtsov's defense team states that the resume contained no information comprising state secret. As Kravtsov's defending attorney, Ivan Pavlov stated that the defense never denied the mere fact of resume submission but argued against the statement that the resume had contained any information comprising state secret. On September 21, 2015, the Moscow City Court sentenced Kravtsov to 14 years of imprisonment in a maximum security penal colony. On February 4, 2016, the Supreme Court of Russia revised Kravtsov's sentence and reduced his imprisonment term to 6 years. The Evgeny Petrin case Pavlov represented interests of Evgeny Petrin who had worked in the Moscow Patriarchy department of external church relations and was detained in June 2014 upon accusation of high treason. According to the investigation, Petrin had provided to the CIA representatives a piece of information comprising state secret when he had worked in the department of external church relations. Petrin himself stated that he was an FSB Captain and had worked in the church department under cover. His brother stated that Evgeny had detected a Ukrainian businessman who, according to Petrin's information, ‚Äúhad assisted to dissent between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian one, had performed anti-Russian activities in Ukraine, and had recruited people, e.g., in Russian government bodies‚Äù. Evgeny Petrin more than once asked the security bodies to initiate a criminal case against that person. However, according to his brother, neither the Russian Orthodox Church nor the FSB had been interested in that so that ‚Äúthey decided to discredit Evgeny, to make him a traitor‚Äù. On June 14, 2016, Petrin was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment in a maximum security penal colony and to a fine of 200 thousand rubles for espionage in favor of the US. Pavlov, as Petrin's defending attorney, says that Petrin was ‚Äúcoerced‚Äù into confession. Pavlov assesses Petrin's sentence as ‚Äúa compromise between severity of accusation and failure of evidence‚Äù: ‚ÄúThe prosecutor demanded a cruel punishment, 19 years of imprisonment, and the Moscow City Court sentenced Evgeny to a minimal term of 12 years. Had he been really guilty, they should have punished him to the full extent. The court decision on a minimal term shows that it wend hard with the prosecution‚Äù. The Sochi cases In December 2016, Ivan Pavlov told about his new case in an interview for the Meduza. He then started defending Oksana Sevastidi sentenced by the Krasnodar Territorial Court to seven years of imprisonment in March 2016 for high treason. It was in 2008, before the military conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, that Sevastidi saw a train with military equipment moving in the direction of Abkhazia, and sent some SMS messages to an acquaintance of hers. In the beginning of 2015, she was arrested by security bodies who considered her SMSs high treason. Earlier, one similar case was known: Ekaterina Kharebava, a market saleswoman from Sochi, was in 2014 sentenced by the Krasnodar Territorial Court to six years of imprisonment for espionage. According to the investigation, in 2008 summer, Kharebava informed a military representative of Georgia on Russian troops‚Äô movement. According to Sevastidi, her first defending counsel, Ruslan Zurnadzhyan, made in fact nothing to defend her and never visited her in the pre-trial detention center. The Krasnodar Territory Bar Chamber inspected Zurnadzhyan's actions and found offense in them[50]. On December 23, 2016, President Vladimir Putin at his annual press conference promised to pay attention to Sevastidi's sentence. In February 2017, the Memorial human rights center recognized Sevastidi a political prisoner. On March 7, 2017, President Putin signed a decree granting pardon to Sevastidi. On March 15, the Supreme Court of Russia revised her sentence and reduced the punishment term from 7 to 3 years. After her release, Sevastidi told about Annik Kesyan, one more woman convicted for a SMS. The Team 29 found that since 2013, the Krasnodar Territorial Court had issued at least ten sentences in case on high treason and espionage, convicting Ekaterina Kharebava, Oksana Sevastidi, Annik Kesyan, Marina Dzhandzhgava, Inga Tutisani, Manana Kapanadze, Petr Parpulov, Leval Latariya, Georgy Pataraya, and Georgy Khurtsilava. Investigators, judges, and the prosecutor were the same practically in all cases and many of them got promotion after those cases. For instance, Roman Troyan, former investigator, became head of the FSB Investigative Department for Krasnodar Territory. Leonid Korzhinek, prosecutor in the Kharebava, Dzhandzhgava, and Sevastidi cases, became Deputy Prosecutor General of Russia in 2016. The Team 29 journalists found that at least six women (Ekaterina Kharebava, Oksana Sevastidi, Annik Kesyan, Marina Dzhandzhgava, Inga Tutisani, and Manana Kapanadze) were convicted just for SMS messages on open movements of military equipment to their acquaintances in Georgia. After that, the Team 29 attorneys entered the cases of Annik Kesyan, Marina Dzhandzhgava, and Inga Tutisani. On July 29, 2017, Vladimir Putin signed decrees on pardon for Marina Dzhandzhgava and Annik Kesyan; on November 16, 2017, the Supreme Court revised Inga Tutisani's sentence and reduced her punishment term from 6 years to 4 years and 1 month. All three women were released. On March 16, 2018, Ivan Pavlov informed on entrance of the case of Petr Parpulov, an ex-flight dispatcher from Sochi convicted by the Krasnodar Territorial Court. Parpulov was convicted to 12 years of imprisonment in a maximum security penal colony in January 2016 for high treason (Article 275 of the Criminal Code of Russia). On March 12, Parpulov's family was notified that he was denied of pardon.  Extremism cases  The Regional Press Institute case Ivan Pavlov represented in court interests of the Regional Press Institute contesting fine imposed for the refusal to self-register as a ‚Äúforeign agent‚Äù NGO and of its Director, Anna Sharogradskaya, when they planned to initiate a criminal case for extremism against her. As a result, the Investigative Committee of Russia refused to initiate a criminal case against Sharogradskaya and the Supreme Court of Russia cancelled the lower-instance court decision on the fine for the Regional Press Institute. The Natalia Sharina case Ivan Pavlov defended Natalia Sharina, ex-Director of the Library for Ukrainian Literature in Moscow, accused of distribution of extremist literature through the library (Article 282 of the Criminal Code of Russia, part 2) and of misspending of money spent for lawyers; work (Article 160, part 4). Sharina was detained in 2015 and spent more than a year under home arrest. Employees of the library told that the books Sharina allegedly had distributed in fact had been planted within the search. Sharina's defense team pointed vagueness and absurdness of the charges against her: she had not been in charge of the library stock acquisition and fees for the lawyers had been permitted by the Department for Culture of the Government of Moscow. Finally, the court found Sharina guilty and gave her a 4-year suspended sentence. The case of Scientologists in St. Petersburg Ivan Pavlov served as a defending attorney for Sakhib Aliyev, chief accountant and one of the five members of the St.-Petersburg Scientologist Church, accused of illegal business practices and religious extremism. Pavlov is sure that ‚Äúthe case of Scientologists is a shameful page in the new history of Russian justice‚Äù since he believes that ‚Äúthey persecute them for their faith, trying to consider them extremists‚Äù and that ‚ÄúFSB already tries to dictate to the public what gods they may or may not worship‚Äù.  Other cases involving state security bodies  The Igor Baranov case In 2013, Pavlov achieved termination of the criminal persecution of Igor Baranov, Professor of the Baltic State Technical University (St.-Petersburg, Russia), accused of ‚Äúan attempt to cross the state border with materials that can be used for production of massive weapons‚Äù (the material in question was Baranov's paper report for an international research conference). The Raoul Wallenberg case Ivan Pavlov and the Team 29 represent in courts interests of the family of Raoul Wallenberg, Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust during the World War II. In 1945, Soviet troops entered Budapest and Wallenberg was arrested by SMERSH officers. In 1957, the Soviet government confirmed the information on capture of Wallenberg and informed that he died from a heart attack in 1947 in the Lubyanka Prison. Wallenberg's family and the Raoul Wallenberg Research Initiative (RWI-70) research group seek for disclosure of Soviet archives that can contain information on Wallenberg's fate. The Russian government refuses to provide important documents, referring to their secrecy or to personal and family secrets the documents contain. On March 29, 2017, Wallenberg's relatives submitted official requests to the Federal Security Service of Russia (FSB), asking to provide documents that could shed light to Wallenberg's fate. The FSB refused to respond to the requests so that the Team 29 and Wallenberg's family members sued the FSB. On September 18, 2017, the Meschansky district court of Moscow rejected the family's claim. On February 20, 2018, the Moscow City Court let stand the decision of the Meschansky district court. Pavlov stated that he was planning to file a cassation appeal and then ‚Äúdirect way to the European Court for Human Rights is opened‚Äù. = Other cases = The case on search of the Memorial Research Center In 2009, Ivan Pavlov managed to achieve a court decision considering unlawful the search that had been performed by investigative bodies in the Memorial Research Center (St.-Petersburg, Russia).  The Suprun case  Ivan Pavlov defended Mikhail Suprun, a historian accused of privacy abuse in 2009 for preparing a memory book of Soviet political repression victims. In January 2014, the European Court for Human Rights started communicating with the Government of the Russian Federation upon the application from Suprun and Pavlov.  The \\"Troll Factory\\" case  In St. Petersburg there is a company whose employees are paid for aggressive pro-governmental posts and comments in the Internet. Lyudmila Savchuk, a former employee of that \\"troll-factory\\", sought to disclose its activities and filed a claim in court for labor violations. Ivan Pavlov represented Ms. Savchuk, and the defendant \\"troll-factory\\" agreed to pay Savchuk her withheld salaries and to restore her labor rights. The Aleksandr Eivazov case Ivan Pavlov is defending Aleksandr Eivazov, former judicial session secretary in the Oktyabrsky district court of St.-Petersburg who told publicly of law violations in the court. Eivazov took the position of judicial session secretary in the Oktyabrsky district court of St.-Petersburg in October 2016. According to his own words, he regularly met law violations (e.g. by judges) in the court. In December 2016, he left the job and submitted to the Ministry for Interior, to the Investigative Committee, to public prosecution, and to some other government bodies tens of complaints against labor law violations, procedural breaches, and ethics abuse by officials. In August 2017, Eivazov was arrested and charged of legal obstruction. According to the investigation, Eivazov had not executed a number of documents in a proper way, trying to damage the judge he had conflicted. Eivazov himself stated that he had not finalized and signed a protocol for one case, having first been on medical leave and then left the job in court immediately; he had considered that it would have been a law violation for him to sign a protocol ex post facto, being not an official of the court. In January 2018, upon a statement by Judge Irina Kerro he had worked with, Eivazov was charged also of libel against her. Since August 2017, Eivazov, suffering from severe bronchial asthma, is kept in a pre-trial detention center; his defending attorneys filed a number of motion for his hospitalization. On January 19, 2018, information came on completion of the case preliminary investigation; on January 23, the investigator commissioned a psychological and psychiatric expert evaluation of Eivazov. On February 14, 2018, his defending attorneys informed on possible forgery of evidence: a blank protocol of victim familiarization with the case materials, signed by Judge Irina Kerro but neither filled nor dated, was found in the case files. The Memorial human rights center recognized Eivazov a political prisoner, and Amnesty International, a prisoner of conscience.  Awards  In 2015, Ivan Pavlov received the Moscow Helsinki Group Award for defending human rights in court. In March 2018, he received the Alison Des Forges Award for Extraordinary Activism, awarded by the Human Rights Watch to activists who put their lives on the line to protect the dignity and rights of others.

Spiritual Dimensions review at All About Jazz The PopMatters review by Will Layman states \\"Though Smith has never compromised his dedication to freely improvised music, his sound is engaging and easy to enjoy: tart, lyrical, often delicate, and always rich in the pregnant silences between notes. He is, in many respects, the greatest successor to Miles Davis in his use of silence, texture, and rhythm in jazz trumpet.\\"Layman, Will.

He attended the University of Minnesota, majoring in electrical engineering. Knutson began his flying career as an Air Force aviation cadet in 1950. Following service in Korea and participation in developmental testing and operational missions in the F-84 and F-86, he flew the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1955 to 1970. Knutson joined NASA in 1971 as manager of U-2 flight operations at Ames and was one of several pilots who flew the aircraft on Earth resources science missions. He later flew the ER-2, an updated model of the U-2 that remains in service at NASA Dryden today. During Knutson's six years at Dryden he maintained the facility at operational readiness for space shuttle landings and replaced Dryden's aging fleet of F-104 support aircraft with F/A-18 Hornets. He also provided leadership for numerous flight research projects including the X-29 forward-swept-wing technology demonstrator; the Controlled Impact Demonstration, the F-15 Digital Electronic Engine Control project that integrated propulsion and flight controls, the Pegasus air-launched rocket for placing small payloads into low-Earth orbit; the CV-990 Landing Systems Research aircraft that tested improved braking systems for the space shuttle; and the F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle. After the Air Force announced the impending retirement of the SR-71 Blackbird, Knutson successfully sought to acquire three of the airplanes for Dryden. In late 1990 he returned to Ames where he served as chief of flight operations until his retirement in 1997. His awards include the Meritorious Service Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross, both from the Air Force, NASA's Outstanding Leadership Award, and the Presidential Rank of Meritorious Executive.

Games  =Tomodachi Daisakusen Dechu= was a pet simulation game released in Japan for the Game Boy Color in 2000. It was the ninth best selling game on the Game Boy Color platform in Japan, with 343,950 copies sold. =Ham-Hams Unite!= is a Hamtaro adventure video game developed by Pax Softnica and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color handheld video game console. It was first released in Japan on April 21, 2001, and was later released in North America on October 28, 2002, and in Europe on January 10, 2003. It was the last game officially released for the Game Boy Color in Europe. It was the seventh best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 497,061 copies sold. The player (Hamtaro) is controlled by the D-pad, and holding down the B button allows the player to run. Pressing A will open a dialogue box with different Ham-chat words depending on context. For instance, standing next to a sunflower seed and selecting \\"hif-hif\\" will pick up the seed, while standing next to an NPC and selecting \\"Hamha\\" will open a dialogue with the character. Different options will yield different outcomes, rolling (Tack-Q) into NPCs will usually elicit a negative response. Objects in the world can be interacted with, like climbing trees and pulling drawers open. The player enters the Clubhouse and is directed by the Boss to round up the other hamsters. =Ham-Ham Heartbreak= Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak is a video game for Game Boy Advance developed by Pax Softnica and published by Nintendo, as the sequel to Tottoko Hamutaro: Tomodachi Daisakusen Dechu and Hamtaro: Ham- Hams Unite!. Therefore, it was the second Hamtaro game released in America and Europe, but the third one in Japan. It was released in Japan on May 3, 2002, in North America on April 8, 2003 and in Europe on June 27, 2003. After Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak, only one more Hamtaro adventure game was released, which was Hamtaro: Rainbow Rescue. Like its predecessors, Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak is an adventure game. Set in the world of the Hamtaro books and anime, the player controls the hamster (\\"Ham-Ham\\", as the hamsters tend to call themselves) Hamtaro. The game expands on the gameplay of the earlier titles by adding Bijou, a friend of Hamtaro who has a crush on him, as partner. Together, they have to save the other ham-hams from Spat, an evil hamster with a hatred for any kind of relation. =Wake Up Snoozer!= Hamtaro: Wake Up Snoozer! is a 2003 educational game for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. It is the only Hamtaro game to be released for PC/Macintosh. Hamtaro and his friends play minigames to wake up Snoozer. The minigames are child- oriented. The game includes special features to work with the Ham-Hams such as: Hamtaro, Bijou, Panda, Howdy, Dexter, Pashmina, Boss, and Oxnard. And options to return to clubhouse, and more. =Rainbow Rescue= is a video game developed by AlphaDream for Game Boy Advance and the sequel to Tottoko Hamutaro: Tomodachi Daisakusen Dechu, Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite! and Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak. It was released in Japan and PAL regions, and was set to be released in North America, but it was cancelled. The series is based on the manga Hamtaro, written by Ritsuko Kawai. The game involves an extensive plot. One day while playing outside, Bijou witnesses a great rainbow. The rainbow disappears and Prince Bo falls to the ground. The Prince states that he can make rainbows by using his umbrella. He tries to prove it to disbelieving Stan and the rest of the Ham-Hams, but realizes too late that the colors on his umbrella are gone. And thus, Hamtaro and his Ham-Ham friends must set off on a journey in order to collect things that are the proper color for Prince Bo to use for his umbrella so he can create a rainbow to return home. Certain minigames are needed to reach the colors, and the player must have certain Ham-Hams in their party in order to play them. For example, Sandy is needed to ride pigeons, Bijou is needed to collect falling petals, and Penelope is needed for rolling on top of cans to get across small streams. In addition to the original Ham-Hams, the game contains some additional characters, most of which were never seen in the English anime. These include Prince Bo, who is the prince of Rainbowland (a castle that is made of clouds); Flora, or Nurse- Ham; Tux; and other various characters. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two eights and two sevens for a total of 30 out of 40. =Ham-Ham Games= is a sports video game developed by AlphaDream and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld video game console.

She also had two half-brothers through her father's first marriage. The family moved to London during her childhood, and then to Rotherhithe and Blackheath. Her father is said to have had \\"a dread of the arts\\", but her mother was a \\"woman of education and taste\\". Partly educated by her mother, Ann was then sent to school in London with her brother Joshua Cristall (baptised 1768‚Äì1847), who became a noted water-colourist.Richard Greene: \\"Cristall, Ann Batten (bap. 1769, d. 1848)\\", rev.

There are several references to her in the correspondence of Mary Wollstonecraft, who wrote to Joshua in March 1790 that Ann's \\"comfort very much depends on you.\\" In a further letter to Joshua on 9 December 1790 she noted, \\"I fear her situation is very uncomfortable. I wish she could obtain a little more strength of mind.\\" Wollstonecraft, along with Barbauld, John Aikin, Mary Hays, Ann Jebb and other literary figures, features in the subscription list for Christall's Poetical Sketches, which was published in 1795 by Joseph Johnson.Paula R. Feldman: British Women Poets of the Romantic Era. An Anthology (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1997), p. 213 ff. This contains seven extracts from the book. It includes a self-deprecating preface by the poet. Cristall's longer narrative poems and her verse pastoral sketches tend to be melancholy and inclined towards the uncanny or even horrific. Critics at the time noted some imperfections, but praised her \\"genius and Warmth of imagination\\". They include some nature description and laments for dying genius.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 248.

A suggestion by the poet George Dyer for Cristall to collaborate with Mary Hays on a \\"poetical novel\\" was not followed through. She was introduced in 1797 to Robert Southey, who praised her genius in a letter of 13 March 1797 to the publisher Joseph Cottle. Later life and death Little is known of Cristall's later life. She appears to have dropped out of the literary social scene after the 1790s and to have remained unmarried. She may have lived latterly with a younger sister, Elizabeth, an engraver, serving as an assistant at Lewisham Hill Grammar School in Kent. She died on 9 February 1848, four months after her brother.

A significant focus of her architecture practice, research, and teaching has been redefining urban spaces of death and remembrance. Early years Karla Rothstein received a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Maryland, School of Architecture in 1988 and a Master of Architecture from Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) in 1992. While at GSAPP, Karla participated in exchange programs in Russia and Switzerland, receiving Certificates of Academic Exchange from the Moscow Institute of Architecture in 1989 and the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in 1991. Prior to co-founding her own architecture practice, Rothstein worked as an international coordinating architect for William McDonough and Ralph Appelbaum & Associates. Work Rothstein's first built work was \\"Ballston Lake House\\" in Saratoga, New York, developed with Joel Towers, which is anchored by 150,000 pounds of precast concrete. It was the only US house included in the book \\"In DETAIL: Single Family Houses\\" (Birkh√§user, 2000) in addition to being counted among notable architecture historian Kenneth Frampton's anthology of American Masterworks (Rizzoli, 2008). In 2014, Karla Rothstein's design of a commercial space that featured custom fabricated concrete blocks cast in flour sacks was recognized by Built by Women New York City and the American Institute of Architects New York. In 2015, Latent's Constellation Park project placed third in an international competition on new ways of memorializing the dead. A model of the project was sold by Christie's at a charity auction and is currently on display at Sir John Soane's Museum in London. Constellation Park was featured in New York Magazine's 2016 Reasons to Love New York issue. Her most notable work was Verboten, a 10,000 square foot night club in Brooklyn, New York. Current projects include the design and development of 25 units of affordable housing in Brownsville, Brooklyn, awarded through the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the design of environmentally-advanced civic infrastructure to replace urban cemeteries, an environmentally-conscious childcare facility in New York City, a prototype for a resilient small scale building in a Rockaways flood zone, and the conversion of a 240,000 square foot former mill in the Berkshires called Greylock Works, among others. Greylock Works is little more than two years into a renovation process that will transform the former industrial site converted into a mixture of food production, residential, hotel and restaurant space. The project was recently awarded a substantial grant of $1.72 million from the Massachusetts State Secretary of Housing and Economic Development. Supported as a Jacob Javits Fellow in Fine Arts from 1988‚Äì1992, a William Kinne Traveling Fellow in 1992, and a NYFA recipient in 2000, Rothstein's professional and academic work has been featured and/or exhibited at Storefront for Art and Architecture, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Barnard College, Columbia University, Van Alen Institute, Max Protetch Gallery, the Center for Architecture, Gizmodo, Architecture Magazine, Casabella, The New York Times, Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and WIRED, Japan.

He owns numerous properties in St. Petersburg, Florida.  Biography  Edwards grew up in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He served in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War, earning a Purple Heart. After the war, he moved to Detroit and entered the mortgage business. Born Edward Francis Sylvia III, he changed his name to William Larry Edwards when he moved to Detroit. Edwards served as president of Mortgage Investors Corp., which the Tampa Bay Times described as the \\"nation's largest VA mortgage lender\\" in 2005. In 2013, the Edwards-owned Mortgage Investors was fined $7.5 million for violating the federal do not call list. That same year, Edwards negotiated a sale of Mortgage Investors to HomeBancorp, but the deal was never completed. After the failure of the deal, Mortgage Investors stopped making new home loans and laid off the majority of its staff. In 2015, two mortgage brokers that never did any business with MIC sued Edwards, alleging that Mortgage Investors had defrauded veteran home buyers and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. =Property ownership= In 2009, Edwards bought the Treasure Island Tennis & Yacht Club. In 2011, he won the right to manage the Mahaffey Theater. Edwards also owns Big3 Entertainment, which has produced records for artists such as Cheap Trick. In 2011, he bought the BayWalk in downtown St. Petersburg. In 2014, the BayWalk reopened as Sundial St. Pete. In 2014, Edwards bought a block of St. Petersburg known as the Tropicana Block. =Sports ownership= In 2013, Edwards bought a controlling interest in the second-tier Tampa Bay Rowdies soccer club, then playing in the North American Soccer League. The team has played in the United Soccer League since 2017. Edwards hoped to move the Rowdies up to Major League Soccer, the league above the USL. He operated Al Lang Stadium for the city of St. Petersburg, and owns the nearby McNulty Station parking garage and a Rowdies-themed bar and restaurant. In October 2018, it was announced that Edwards had sold the club to Tampa Bay Rays, the area's Major League Baseball franchise, who announced plans to purchase the Rowdies and assume control of Al Lang Stadium. In November 2016, Edwards filed a complaint against the Rowdies' arch-rival, Fort Lauderdale Strikers' holding company, Miami FC, LLC, over money loaned to the struggling club. Edwards claimed that the team had failed to pay him back $300,000 in loans. He sought damages and foreclosure on Fort Lauderdale‚Äôs assets in the lawsuit. A signed promissory note showed that the collateral put up to secure the loans included the team‚Äôs patents, copyrights, trademarks, rights to use of the name \\"Fort Lauderdale Strikers\\" along with other tangible assets. In May 2017 Edwards was awarded a summary judgment in the case, and after a June 2017 public sale, gained control of the copyrights, trademarks and any rights to the use of the name \\"Fort Lauderdale Strikers\\" or any variation for $5,100. He has yet to announce what he plans to do with the Strikers brand. = Political activities = Edwards donated $1 million to the campaign of Florida Governor Rick Scott and $4.6 million to the 2012 Republican National Convention. He donated $350,000 to the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.

At this time, Simpson was training at the Gyros Gymnastics Club program in Toronto. Shortly after the 1994 season, Richelle moved to the Winstonettes Gymnastics Association club in Unionville, Ontario; the same program that created 1988 Olympian and Florida Gators gymnast Christina McDonald ‚Äì training under the direction of Leonid Grakovsky and Debbie Vidmar. After winning the provincial Level 3 title in the spring of 1996, Simpson exceeded expectations by transitioning from the provincial stream to the High Performance program. As a result, she received a qualification berth to the 1996 Elite Canada competition. A year later, during the mid-May 1997, Richelle participated in her first Canadian National Gymnastics Championships; making the Junior Elite division. After a strong first day of competition, tying for third position with Lise Leveille and qualifying to three event finals, Simpson sustained an injury during the second day's warm-ups and was forced to withdraw from the competition. As her injury wasn't too serious, Richelle was able to participate in the 1997 Elite Canada competition where she placed thirteenth ‚Äì earning a qualification berth to the Senior High Performance the following season. = 1998‚Äì99: Senior International Elite career = To open her inaugural senior season, Simpson participated at both the Bluewater Invitational and the Wild Rose competition; finishing eighth in the all-around at both.

Poised for more international success, Richelle competed at her second National Championships, held in late May, in Hamilton, Ontario. A rough first day of competition left her in twenty-first place, despite qualifying to both the vault and floor event finals. However, a competent second day result rendered her to fourteenth in the all-around. Richelle finished her first senior season at the Elite Canada, placing in ninth all-around; after debuting some new and dynamic skills.

The comic features the character Cucumber and his sister Almond traveling across a fictional world in order to defeat the Nightmare Knight, meeting various friends and foes on the way. The childfriendly comic has multiple volumes in print thanks to crowdfunding. Plot and setting Clockwise from top: Carrot, Nautilus, Cucumber, Almond. Sporting a \\"bright, candy-colored look\\" and featuring \\"adorably rendered\\" bunny people dressed in the style of food, Cucumber Quest tells the story of Cucumber, a young boy that simply wants to go to \\"magic school,\\" but is forced into heroism as the magical land is in danger and his father is captured. Together with his more heroically-inclined sister Almond, the cowardly Sir Carrot and the energetic Princess Nautilus, Cucumber travels the fantasy world to collect signatures of the princesses of each of the six kingdoms of Dreamside, meeting various eccentric characters on the way. Development Cucumber Quest is Gigi D.G.'s second major webcomic project - her first being Hiimdaisy, a gag-a-day webcomic that provided bizarre twists to various video games. Hiimdaisy is no longer officially available, but the video game influence has persisted in Cucumber Quest. Though not explicitly referring to gaming, Cucumber Quest is influenced by Kirby and Paper Mario, making use of various video game tropes. In an interview with io9, Gigi D.G. stated that she came up with the earliest idea for what would eventually become Cucumber Quest while playing video games as a child, and she noted that setting the story against a typical \\"hero's journey\\" backdrop allowed her to subvert many reader expectations and provided her with many opportunities for humor while driving the story further. While attempting to raise 10,000 USD through Kickstarter to self-publish the first volume of Cucumber Quest in 2012, Gigi D.G. made 62,953 USD long before the deadline of the campaign. Multiple printed volumes have been released. In October 2017, First Second Books began publishing a new physical release of Cucumber Quest. In 2016, Gigi D.G. made a new one-shot webcomic, titled Lady of the Shard. The infinite canvas webcomic, which was heavily praised by Zachary Clementy on Comics Beat, is‚Äîin stark contrast to Cucumber Quests rich color palettes‚Äîdeliberately limited to two or three colors at a time. In 2019, Gigi D.G. announced that Cucumber Quest would not be continuing as a comic, but would eventually be concluded in illustrated script format, citing changing circumstances in her personal life. Reception Larry Cruz of Comic Book Resources has praised Cucumber Quest for its humor and art style. While noting that its \\"story is fun and more polished than a lot of webcomics,\\" Cruz states that he'd recommend the comic for its art alone. Lauren Davis of io9 stated that it is easy to think of Cucumber Quest as a \\"children's comic,\\" but that it has a lot \\"sly moments\\" that raise interesting questions in the reader. Davis listed Cucumber Quest among 51 webcomics that should have been nominated for an Eisner award, but never have, as well as their \\"top 10 webcomics that would make incredible TV shows,\\" noting it would fit in well with animated shows such as Adventure Time and Steven Universe. Storyboard artist of Cartoon Network series We Bare Bears, Louie Zong, has stated that reading Cucumber Quest inspired him to become an artist.

The Museo del Caracol (lit. Snail Museum) is a Mexican history museum, at the bottom of the access ramp to the Castillo de Chapultepec in Mexico City. The ‚ÄúSnail Museum‚Äù is a spiral shaped building designed by the architect Pedro Ramirez Vazquez. The director is Patricia Torres Aguilar Ugarte. It is opens from Tuesday to Thursday from 9:00 to 16:45.  Building  Each of the exhibition halls are found around a central tower. One of the most important pieces of the museum is the bronze handrail of the main stairs. It was made by the muralist Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado and represents the fusion of two cultures (European and indigenous). To symbolize the colors of the Mexican flag, Ch√°vez Morado covered with red tezontle the walls of the main tower, built the header of the constitution showcase with green marble, and placed white marble on the floor.  Exhibitions  Papilla (nickname of the person shown on the picture), detail of the model on the Museo del Caracol in Mexico City about the assault to the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas (building in Guanajuato) in 1810. The museum is divided into five exhibitions. The first is called the ‚ÄúIndependence and first empire‚Äù. It is divided in four halls that are the final years of the viceroyalty, Miguel Hidalgo¬¥s insurgency, Jose Maria Morelos participation, and the end of the Independence. The second one recounts the events of the ‚ÄúRepublic and Northern Invasion‚Äù. This exhibition has two halls starting with how the First Mexican Republic is born and afterwards the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The third exhibition is called ‚ÄúReform and Restored Republic‚Äù. It has two main topics that includes the Reform War and the French Intervention. The fourth exhibition is called the ‚ÄúPorfiriato‚Äù. It shows the happenings during Diaz‚Äôs presidency. The last exhibition is called ‚ÄúRevolution‚Äù. It exhibits the main historical moments of the Mexican Revolution, the promulgation of the 1917 Mexican Constitution, and Mexico today. Diorama of the defense of a nation and its flag. Depending on the exhibition hall, it may contain clay sculptures of Mexican characters and heroes, maps, paintings, flags, documents, portraits and photographs that portray Mexican history. A main characteristic of this museum is that it does not have any antique pieces. Instead, it has didactic exhibits such as models, portraits, maps and documents. The first part recreates scenes from Mexico with clay figures and scenographies made of wood and plastic. Each model has an audio and illumination system that plays narrations from the represented events. It includes the quotes from the main protagonists, as well as the music of that time. This improves the dramatics of the scenes. This museum portrays how common life in New Spain was during the late years of the viceroyalty, when the first conspiracies against the crown took place. The main events of the Independence War are explained as well as all the conspiracies from the criollo against the crown. It portrays the hard path that the country followed during the 19th century: interventionism, inside wars, territory loss. The contradictions of the Porfiriato are exposed such as the stability that provided the inequality in economy. The museum makes a special emphasis in Madero‚Äôs and all constitutionalists' roles in the Mexican Revolution.  History  Adolfo Lopez Mateos was the president that opened the museum doors in 1960. Its construction was promoted by the professor Jaime Torres Bodet, who was secretary of public education. It opened in 1960 by the president Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos, with the objective of teach the modern history of Mexico, from the independence war to the Mexican Revolution. It was constructed because of the 150th anniversary of the beginning of Independence and the 50th anniversary of the Revolution. A selected group of people participated on this project. The architect Pedro Ramirez Vazquez created a building that is in harmony with the Chapultepec hill. Iker Larrauri and Julio Prieto made the reconstruction of the scenes and the environment of the past. Ehe historian Arturo Arnaiz and Freg, elaborated the historical script. In only ten months the museum was ready. When it was inaugurated, the secretary Torres Bodet explained that the museum had an education function that would be like ‚Äúan open textbook‚Äù so that people would find it easy to understand.

Miller, whose stage name comes from an Egyptian archaeological site Amarna and the writer Henry Miller, graduated in fine arts from the European University of Madrid. She is openly bisexual, polyamorous and practices BDSM.  Career  Miller joined the adult film industry at 19 years-old, producing her first adult film and working on her own film production company called Omnia-X for five years. She has appeared in over 100 adult films according to IAFD, working for adult film studios such as Private, Dorcel, Bang Bros, Blacked or Sex Art, as well as filming erotic, artistic and self-managed films with Four Chambered Heart, while also collaborating in the magazines PlayGround, Primera L√≠nea and on the Orgasmatrix website. Despite being a supporter of feminist pornography, she acknowledges that she works in \\"an industry made by and for men\\" and that \\"if I only shot feminist porn, I would not pay half a bill‚Äù. Another concept widely used by her is ethical pornography, based on respect for actors and actresses: salary, contracts, working conditions, etc. In the Primera Persona Festival of 2015 Miller explained that these rights are not respected, only the United States has mechanisms of control and complaint of these situations. She was the spokeswoman and protagonist of the controversial promotional spot of the Erotic Salon of Barcelona 2016. The advertisement, called Patria and awarded with a Silver Lion at the Cannes Lions festival, criticizes Spanish double standard and ends with the phrase \\"We live in a disgustingly hypocritical country, but some of us do not give up\\". In 2017, she starred in her first feature film called Contigo no, bicho directed by √Ålvaro Alonso and Miguel √Ångel Jim√©nez, which premiered at the M√°laga Film Festival. In September of that year, she was injured in a motorcycle accident in Puerto Princesa, Palawan in the Philippines, sustaining injuries to her right shoulder, elbow, and leg, requiring surgery and a blood transfusion. Since March 2018 she has a Patreon page, a crowdfunding site that allows her to subsidize her videos and activities, rewarding her followers with exclusive advantages. Although she has not said a definite goodbye to pornography, she has stopped shooting voluntarily since the beginning of 2017 because it is no longer a challenge and she wants to live new experiences. She is aware of the difficulty of this new path due to the stigma she suffers from having devoted herself to sex work, according to her own words \\"I will always be the porn actress who...\\".  Media appearances  She has taken part, among others, on the television programs Al rinc√≥n de pensar (Antena 3), Late Motiv (Movistar+), S√°lvame Deluxe (Telecinco), and The Zoo (LATV), while also taking part on the independent radio program Carne Cruda. She presents the television show Diario Vice on channel 0 of Movistar+ where she interviewed the Spanish artist Abel Azcona and the musical band Las Odio. In 2016 she was interviewed by Buenafuente in Late Motiv. In 2018 she assisted to the TV program La Resistencia, presented by David Broncano. She appeared in the cover magazine Intervi√∫ in 2014 and 2016, as well as Bad Skin, Mongolia and Primera L√≠nea. In digital media, she has done many interviews such as Erebus, Jot Down and GQ. She is also very active in social media. She uses her YouTube channel to express ideas about sustainability, stigma rupture and ecology. In this channel, Miller tells her experiences like living a month in her van or without producing trash, why she gave up pornography, or what medicines to take when going to a foreign country.  Literary publications  In 2015, she published her first book titled Manual de psicon√°utica with the publisher Lapsus Calami (while the prologue was done by Nacho Vigalondo and the epilogue by Luna Miguel) and it was a mix of poetry and photography. She defined it as \\"my personal labyrinth, my nook, my innermost\\". She also wrote the prologue of @Alicia_hot written by Alejandro Ruiz Morillas, the back cover of the book Post Co√±o written by Gaby Bess (both in 2015) and the prologue of X written by Risto Mejide in 2016.  Pornography, feminism, diversity and religion  In May 2016, she held a talk with the deputies of Podemos Beatriz Gimeno and Clara Serra titled \\"Sex, porn and feminism\\" in which she said that pornography can not be used for sex education, but her presence in this talk was not well received by some feminist sectors. She held a talk again with Clara Serra in 2017, this time accompanied by the pornographic actor Aday Traun, at the Charles III University of Madrid titled \\"Pornography and diversity\\" in which she criticized some clich√©s of the pornographic industry.

He subsequently served as Governor of Bermuda from 1949 to 1955.  Early life  Hood was born in Leith, Edinburgh, and educated at George Watson's College. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1910 and achieving his MD in 1931 for his research on dysentery. In 1918, Hood married Evelyn Dulcia Ellwood, with whom he had one son and two daughters.  Military career  After spending one year as the house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Hood joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). He served in France and Belgium during the First World War, and then in India and Afghanistan shortly afterwards. He became a specialist in pathology, serving in Meerut and Bangalore and then as deputy assistant district pathologist for Madras region. Hood conducted research on cerebrospinal meningitis and pneumonic plague, and in 1929 he was appointed assistant district pathologist to Southern Command. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Hood was given the rank of colonel and made deputy director of medical services, Palestine. In 1941, he was promoted over several more senior figures to become Lieutenant-General Director General Army Medical Services. As DGAMS, Hood was credited with supporting developments in Army Psychiatry, helping to provide forward surgery and reorganise field medical units, and organising a blood transfusion service. By August, he was also honorary physician to George VI. He served for far longer as DGAMS than was usual. He also decreed that medical research conducted on soldiers should be solely for the purpose of preventing and curing disease and allaying injury. Hood had hoped to become the first head of a combined medical service for Navy, Army and Air Force, but this did not happen.  Civil career  Hood worked for one year in the Ministry of Health. After this, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief Bermuda. As Governor, Hood oversaw the closure of the Bermuda Garrison in 1953 and also acted as host to Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Dwight D. Eisenhower during the Bermuda Conferences. The closure of the garrison was completed by 1 May 1953, but was very short-lived. However, a detachment of the Royal Welch Fusiliers was temporarily posted to Bermuda immediately after for the period of the conference, planned for June, 1953. The conference was actually delayed until December, when the Prime Minister was convinced to reverse the closure of the garrison, resulting in 'A' Company, 1st Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (1 DCLI) being posted to Prospect Camp in 1954.A Company, 1st Battalion, The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry: Prospect Garrison, Devonshire Bermuda: 1954 - 1957. Hood's tenure in the role was extended twice. Hood resigned effective 26 April 1955, with no explanation given. A few months later, he was granted a divorce from Lady Evelyn Dulcia Hood and married Mrs Helen Winifred Wilkinson of Hamilton, Bermuda on the same day.  Other achievements  Hood enjoyed golf and was the RAMC champion. He won the Queen Victoria Jubilee Vase at St Andrews in 1953. When Hood died in Bermuda on 11 September 1980, his service with the RAMC was commemorated by the naming in his honour of a lecture theatre in the training depot.

He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1992 and to Professor in 1995. In 1996, he moved to Cornell University, holding the first BP Amoco/H. Laurance Fuller Chair in Chemical Engineering. He joined the faculty at Yale University, as the Goizueta Foundation Professor of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, in July 2002 and became the first chair of Yale's Department of Biomedical Engineering in 2003. Since he arrived at Yale in 2002 to form the new department, he has seen his faculty group grow to 19 members. He hired slowly, knowing that each new person would have a significant effect on the overall department culture. Saltzman settled on four areas to excel in: imaging, biomolecular engineering, biomechanics, and systems biology. The department has developed largely as its founders envisioned‚Äîmultidisciplinary, collegial, integrated with the medical school, and committed to undergraduate education. As of July 1, 2016, Saltzman serves as Head of Jonathan Edwards College at Yale University.http://news.yale.edu/2016/05/06/next-head-jonathan-edwards- college-be-w-mark-saltzman Research Saltzman's research focuses on developing the most economical, transportable and accessible methods for disease prevention and methods to more effectively deliver chemotherapy to the most aggressive forms of brain tumors. Dr. Saltzman's research interests include controlled drug delivery to the brain, polymers for supplementing or stimulating the immune system, cell interactions with polymers, and tissue engineering. He studies how to create safer and more effective medical and surgical therapy based on tissue engineering. Dr. Saltzman worked with an interdisciplinary team to develop what is now the standard of care for treating brain tumors.

It was commissioned by Edward Simeon, a Reading-born merchant who became extremely wealthy as a City of London trader. Edward Simeon's brother John Simeon was a former Member of Parliament for Reading who had lost his seat in the 1802 elections to the parliament of the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, since which time the family had been engaged in ostentatious spending locally in an effort to gain support among the town's voters. Although street lighting had been installed in Reading in 1797, the system used was one of lamps attached to the sides of buildings and as a consequence open spaces remained unlit. In 1804 Simeon persuaded the Mayor of Reading that it would be of benefit to erect a structure in Market Place, which would serve both to carry lamps to light the area and to improve the flow of traffic in the area, and volunteered to pay for such a structure himself. Simeon commissioned local architect John Soane to design a suitable structure. Soane designed an unusual triangular structure, high and built of Portland stone. It had no official unveiling or opening ceremony, but the stonework was complete by September 1804. The structure was immediately controversial, denounced within weeks of its opening as \\"a paltry gew-gaw thing without use, or name\\", built by Simeon to promote himself rather than for the public benefit. In early 1805 Simeon donated an annuity of 3% interest on ¬£1000 to pay for the lamps on the obelisk to be lit in perpetuity. By 1900 a cabmen's shelter had been erected next to the monument, and in 1933 underground public toilets had been built alongside it. Although Simeon had stipulated that the lamps were to remain lighted forever, by this time the lamps were no longer operational, having been replaced by baskets of flowers in 1911. Although the monument was Grade II listed in 1956, by this time it was becoming extremely dilapidated. The market was relocated away from Market Place in the 1970s, and the obelisk avoided demolition primarily owing to lobbying by admirers of Soane, as it was the last surviving structure in Reading to have been designed by him. In 2005 Reading Borough Council agreed to landscape Market Place and to renovate the Simeon Monument. The now-disused toilets and other structures around the monument were removed, and the monument itself was restored to its former condition. Background Market Place, Reading, 1795 The town of Reading is at the confluence of the River Thames and River Kennet, approximately west of London. The settlement has existed since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, it became a prominent town in 1121 following the foundation of Reading Abbey. Located on the Great West Road, the main route connecting London to Bath and Bristol, and with the Thames providing direct shipping routes to London and Oxford, the city grew prosperous and became a major industrial centre, particularly noted for its iron production and breweries, as well as a major market town for the surrounding area. Market Place in Reading was a large triangular piece of open land, surrounded by shops, which since the twelfth century had been the site of Reading's market. The Borough Corporation maintained the area, in return for a tax of one pint of corn from each sack sold. While the outdoor market in Market Place had traditionally specialised in dairy produce, meat and poultry, the sale of these items had been moved to a nearby purpose-built market hall in 1800, leaving Market Place dealing with trade in grain, fruit, vegetables and \\"colonial or manufactured articles\\"; Reading was considered one of the cheapest places in the country to buy imported and manufactured items. By the early nineteenth century, around 200 wagons of produce would arrive in Reading on busy market days. Although Reading had introduced street lighting in 1797, this system did not use lamp posts and instead consisted of oil lamps attached to the walls of buildings. As a consequence, open areas such as Market Place remained unlit other than around their edges. =John Soane= John Soane John Soane (from 1831 Sir John Soane) was a local architect, born in nearby Goring in 1753 and educated at William Baker's Academy in Reading. After a successful early career designing country houses, on 16 October 1788 he was appointed architect and surveyor to the Bank of England. In addition to his work for the Bank of England he continued to design other buildings, including in 1789 a brewery in Bridge Street, Reading, and in 1796 a house for Lancelot Austwick, who was to become Mayor of Reading in 1803. =Edward Simeon= Edward Simeon (1755‚Äì1812) was a Reading-born merchant, who became extremely wealthy as a City of London trader. From 1792 he was a director of the Bank of England. Although he lived in London, in Salvadore House on White Hart Court, he maintained links with Reading. His 1792 wedding took place there, and he regularly donated clothing to the poor children of the town. The Simeon family were prominent in the town; John Simeon, brother to Edward, was the Recorder of Reading and a Tory politician who had been elected MP for the town in the 1796 British general election, lost his seat in the 1802 election to the parliament of the newly created United Kingdom, and successfully regained the seat in the 1806 general election. John Simeon was a controversial and reactionary figure who opposed the poor being taught arithmetic or writing, and following his defeat in 1802 the Simeon family had been engaged in ostentatious efforts to curry favour with the approximately 300 men who were entitled to vote in Reading's elections. Edward Simeon in 1808. The paper in his hand reads \\"Reading Lighting\\". Concerned about the appearance of the Market Place and the congestion caused by traffic passing through it, Simeon wrote to Lancelot Austwick, the Mayor of Reading, on 24 January 1804: Austwick approved Simeon's plan, and John Soane was approached to design an obelisk with the dual purpose of acting as an obstruction to prevent wagons driving across Market Place, and holding four lamps to illuminate the area. Design and construction Soane's initial design was based on an unbuilt Palladian structure Soane had designed for Norwich Market, comprising a square base with Ionic columns supporting a cupola and four lamps on diagonally-set piers; the cupola would in turn be topped with a caduceus. He soon rejected this shape in favour of an unconventional triangular design. It is unrecorded why he made this choice; Sowan (2007) speculates that it may have been inspired by triangular Roman lamps Soane had seen on a recent visit to Pompeii, although it is more likely to be a response to the triangular shape of Market Place itself. His final design was a mixture of differing architectural styles, and consisted of a triangular base with each corner supporting a wrought iron lamp, surrounding a fluted three-sided Portland stone column, which in turn supported a stone cylinder topped with a bronze or copper pinecone. In total, the structure was to be tall. Market Place in 1807, with the newly erected monument In May 1804 the Borough Corporation approved Simeon and Soane's scheme, although the proposed metal pinecone was replaced with a pinecone in carved stone, and by 20 July Soane was in Reading supervising construction. Robert Spiller was paid ¬£310 3/‚Äì (about ¬£ in terms) to build the structure. Bricklayer J Lovegrove built the brick core of the base, James Marshall was stonemason, and Thomas Russell the blacksmith. The base of the structure was adorned with a large metal plaque reading: On the remaining two sides are bronze works, one consisting of the arms of Simeon, the other showing a crowned head surrounded by four uncrowned heads. The corner columns bear carved fasces. Completion Market Place 1875 There was no unveiling ceremony for the monument and the date its lamps were first lit is not recorded, but the stonework was complete by the time Soane inspected it on 3 September 1804. The first recorded mention of the completed monument comes in a report of a dinner hosted on 10 September 1804 by Reading's MP Charles Shaw- Lefevre, reporting that \\"Mr Monck was remarkably happy in his allusion to a certain newly erected monument, by observing that some gentlemen endeavoured to ingratiate themselves with the Electors by raising monuments of stone, and having their transitory names emblazoned on them in brass, but that his friend raised a more lasting monument, in the breasts and hearts of his constituents\\". The monument proved immediately controversial; a letter published in the Reading Mercury on 24 September accused Simeon of attempting to \\"bias the heads of the Borough in his favour by setting up in the market- place a paltry gew-gaw thing without use, or name\\", and stating that \\"Some denominate it an obelisk, others a pillar, but among the generality of the inhabitants it is called a p****** post\\". At this time the lamps were not yet in place, and it is possible that the anonymous critic (likely to have been local historian John Man) was not aware that the structure was intended as a lamp-post to illuminate the market, and thought that Simeon had erected the column as a monument to himself. The triangular base of the monument has shallow recesses on each side, the railings surrounding it had not yet been installed, and as the lamps were not yet operational these recesses would have offered a degree of privacy, so it is likely that the anonymous author was correct in asserting that at that time the structure was being used as an impromptu urinal. During the planning and construction of the monument, Edward Simeon had commissioned what he described as \\"a variety of experiments ... to produce the most effectual and brilliant light\\". On 17 January 1805, with the monument now in place, he wrote to George Gilbertson, the Mayor of Reading, advising that: The lamps themselves, along with their supports, were supplied by John Neville of Fleet Street in London. Neville died before being fully paid for the lamps and supports, and Simeon neglected to pay his heirs. On 18 August 1809, following Neville's death, his brother threatened to attach a second plaque to the structure reading \\"Edward Simeon Esq, of Salvadore House Accepted from William Neville of Fleet Street ¬£20.9s.7d as a small donation towards the expense of erecting his obelisk in commemoration of his name for the work and expenses attending the same performed by his late brother John Neville 416 Strand London\\". In January 1810 Soane and Simeon each paid half of the outstanding sum to William Neville; Neville returned both cheques, requesting that Simeon donate his share of the sum to a local charity in Reading and that Soane keep his share to do with as he wished. While some welcomed the erection of the obelisk, others questioned its use and practicality, and were sceptical of Simeon's motives in funding it. Some felt its design was inappropriate, and as early as September 1804 an anonymous correspondent to the Reading Mercury described it as \\"A spruce pedestal of Wedgwood Ware, where motley arms and tawdry emblems glare\\", and sarcastically referred to the monument as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\". John Man, describing Market Place in his 1810 A Stranger in Reading, wrote that: The obelisk decorated for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, 1887 Although Man disliked the Simeon Monument, he was nonetheless an admirer of Soane, whom he described in the same book as \\"one of London's first architects ... whose numerous works, in the city [London], and other parts of the kingdom, are convincing proofs of his superior abilities, in a line which has yet to boast of very few masters\\". The structure was never officially named, and since its erection has been referred to as the \\"Simeon Monument\\", \\"Soane Monument\\", \\"Simeon Obelisk\\" and \\"Soane Obelisk\\" interchangeably. As it was built to illuminate the market and divert the flow of traffic, rather than to officially commemorate any person or event, it is not strictly a monument; as it is a triangular rather than a square structure, it is not technically an obelisk; it was commissioned by Simeon and designed by Soane. Its listing on the National Heritage List for England describes it as the Simeon Monument, as does Soane's biographer Dorothy Stroud, while Adam Sowan's A Mark of Affection (2007) describes it as the \\"Soane Obelisk\\", on the grounds that \\"[Soane's] greater fame has no doubt saved it from demolition, and obelisk ... is what Simeon asked for\\". Later developments Market Place in 1907; by this time a cabmen's shelter had been built adjacent to the monument Edward Simeon died on 14 December 1812 in Highgate, \\"cut off prematurely with a peculiar and distressing malady\\". He left ¬£4715 (about ¬£ in terms) to local causes in his will. The ¬£1000 annuity at 3% which Edward Simeon had gifted in 1805 for the maintenance of the lamps proved more than was needed to keep the lighting operational following the conversion of the lamps to cheaper gas lighting in the 1840s and was unnecessary after the lamps were removed in 1911. In 1883 Simeon's bequest was transferred to the Official Trustee, with the dividends continuing to be used to pay for gas to the lamps. The surpluses were diverted to other local causes such as illuminating Market Place's clock. In the mid 1840s, Neville's oil lamps were replaced by cheaper gas lamps, supported by heavier brackets; these in turn were replaced by tall lamp posts affixed to the ground rather than the monument itself in 1890. In 1911 the lamps were shut down and replaced with baskets of flowers. Although the original railings surrounding the structure had been an elaborate design of palmettes alternating with flame palmettes, by 1880 these had been replaced by railings of a more austere and functional design. By 1900 a cabmen's shelter had been constructed next to the monument, later used as a hut the attendants of a car park opened next to the obelisk to serve the market. Underground public toilets were installed adjacent to the obelisk in 1933. Dilapidation and renovation Reading Market during the Second World War. By now the monument (right) was almost completely obscured by surrounding structures In 1956 the monument was Grade II listed. By this time, the structure was severely dilapidated, and described as \\"effectively ruined\\". In 1965 responsibility for the monument was transferred to Reading Borough Council. In 1971 the baskets of flowers hanging from the disused lamp brackets were removed, and electric light bulbs in mock gas lamps installed, while in the mid-1970s the market itself was relocated across the town centre to Hosier Street, near its original site prior to its relocation to Market Place in the twelfth century. In 1981 the car park was closed, and in 1985 wheelchair-accessible toilets were erected next to the entrance to the underground toilets, clad in Portland stone to blend in with the Simeon Monument. By this time, the Monument was dilapidated and had survived demolition mainly through lobbying by admirers of Soane; a 2003 profile of the structure in the Daily Telegraph described this \\"strange, tripodal stalk of limestone\\" as \\"a rather clumsy bit of masonry, revered by Soane fans, ignored by everyone else\\". Market Place in 2018, following the landscaping of the former market site and the restoration of the obelisk Although Soane's designs had become unpopular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and most of his buildings had been demolished or significantly altered, following his championing by Nikolaus Pevsner from the 1950s onwards attitudes began to slowly change. In 2005, following pressure from the Soane Monuments Trust, Reading Council agreed to landscape Market Place, removing the now-disused toilets and their airshaft and other structures surrounding the obelisk, and commissioning Julian Harrap to restore the monument itself. Following works costing a total of approximately ¬£60,000 (¬£15,000 of which was provided by the Soane Monument Trust), the renovated monument was unveiled on 18 December 2007. By this time, the monument was the last surviving structure in Reading to have been designed by Soane.

The firm's headquarters are in the Basque Country near San Sebasti√°n, Northern Spain. History thumb Wavegarden was founded in 2005 in Spain by spouses Josema Odriozola (a Spanish Basque engineer and surfer) and Karin Frisch (a German sports economist and surfer) aiming at producing an authentic surfing experience. In 2011, images were made public of its first full size prototype in the Basque Country (Spain). In 2013, a second bigger prototype was launched offering larger, longer and more frequent rides. thefirm's staff of 50 consists mostly of engineers, architects, and computer science and fluid dynamic experts working with technical suppliers. Technology thumb A Wavegarden lagoon comprises a group of items that constitute the wave generating technology. These include the lagoon design and bathymetry, wavefoil and drive system, control unit, pier structure and dissipative shores. The wavefoil is a large hydrodynamic blade that shares similarities with an aeroplane wing and the plow of a snowcat. The wavefoil shuttles underwater at a speed of approximately 4.5 to 7 metres per second from one end of the lagoon to the other, creating a clean swell. The energy of the swell interacts with the shallowing sections of the lagoon's bed, causing it to build in size and steepen. Directly induced by the bathymetry, the swell turns into a wave and starts to break. Wavegarden surf lagoons On August 1, 2015 the first Wavegarden lagoon , Surf Snowdonia in Dolgarrog, North Wales, opened to the public. . thumb NLand Surf Park in Austin, Texas featured their second commercial lagoon when it opened for business on 7 Oct 2016.

He was also a director of the DBT Centre for Blue-Green Algae at Madurai Kamaraj University and a recipient of the VASVIK Industrial Research Award and Om Prakash Bhasin Award. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1992.  Biography  Venkataraman was born on 1 February 1930 to Lokanayaki and G. R. Sitaraman, a freedom fighter, at a small hamlet in Tirunelveli district by name, Tenkasi, in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. His early education was at the local village school after which he did his intermediate (higher secondary) from St. Xavier's College, Palayamkottai. At Alagappa Chettiar College, Karaikudi, where he joined for his graduate studies, he had the opportunity to learn under S. Doraisamy, an algologist and a prot√©g√© of M. O. P. Iyengar, a renowned phycologist. His master's degree came from Banaras Hindu University and, on getting a Government of India fellowship, he pursued doctoral studies under the guidance of Y. Bharadwaja and secured a PhD and DSc from the same university. His career started as an Assistant Botanist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in 1956. With the guidance of M. S. Randhawa, then Vice-President of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, he established an algal research centre at the institute which is known to have conducted research on Algae and published several research papers and books on the subject. Through his researches, he established the role of algae in agriculture as a nitrogen fixing agent which was accepted by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), among others. He also initiated master's and doctoral courses in Agricultural Phycology at the institute to foster research and for training manpower. Supported by a grant from the Department of Biotechnology, he also established a national facility for the collection and distribution of Blue-green algae (BGA) cultures. When the Department of Science and Technology initiated a national level project on Algae for fertilizer, feed and fuel in 1976, Venkataraman was selected to head the project as its director. The project, which had state and central participation, is reported to have been successful in the dissemination knowledge on BGA bio-fertilizers among Indian farming community. His studies revealed the importance of rice strain selection as he maintained that different strains have differing ability and adaptability vis-√†-vis soil conditions, resistance to pesticides and insensitivity to sources of nitrogen like nitrates and Ammonium. He demonstrated the transfer of fixed nitrogen from algae to rice plants using 15N. He also developed a method for the in situ production of the BGA bio-fertilizer which he later improved by growing pure cultures of BGA on solid organic substrates, an achievement during his days at the School of Biological Sciences of Madurai Kamaraj University. Venkataraman's book, The Cultivation of Algae, published by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1969, is a monograph on the culture and cultivation of algae while the 1974 publication, Algae: form and function, and Vaucheriaceae, deal with the scientific aspects of Algae. Two other books, Algal biofertilizers and rice cultivation and Blue-green algae for rice production : a manual for its promotion detail the algal applications in agriculture and one of the books he edited, Plant protection in the year 2000 AD covers the papers and proceedings of the conference held at New Delhi in December 1984. He was the editor of another book, Cyanobacterial biotechnology, a presentation of selected papers from the International Symposium on Cyanobacterial Biotechnology, held in Tiruchirappalli in September 1996. He also published over 170 articles on the subject. Venkataraman served as the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Phycology and was a member of the editorial boards of Biological Wastes and MIRCEN Journal of Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology. He was the Editor of the INSA scientific publications from 1983 to 1986 and a member of the sectional committee and the council of the Indian National Science Academy. He was associated with the International Rice Research Institute as a member of its Policy Advisory Committee on Microbiological Nitrogen Fixation and was a director of the Indo-US Science and Technology Collaborative Programme in Agriculture. He served as the visiting professor at Japan Agriculture Society and was a consultant to the Food and Agriculture Organization. Venkataraman died on 3 October 1998, at the age of 68.  Awards and honours  Venkitaraman's memoirs have been included in the 24th volume of Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy, a compendium periodically published by the Indian National Science Academy, featuring its deceased and living fellows. The Indian Academy of Sciences elected him as their fellow in 1974 and the Indian National Science Academy followed suit in 1984. He was also an elected fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India and a fellow of the National Geographical Society and Phycological Society of India. He received the VASVIK Industrial Research Award in 1978, Sanjay Gandhi Award for Science and Technology, four years later and the National Lecturer Award of the University Grants Commission in 1986. In 1988, he was awarded the Om Prakash Bhasin Award by the Om Prakash Bhasin Foundation for his contributions to Agriculture and Allied Sciences. The Government of India included him in the 1992 Republic Day honours list for the civilian award of the Padma Shri. Venkataraman, who was a holder of Humboldt Research Fellowship, delivered several award lectures including the Professor Panchanan Maheshwari Memorial Award Lecture of the Indian National Science Academy. He was also a recipient of the Alagappa Gold medal for his academic excellence from his alma mater, Alagappa Chettiyar College and the Australian Bicentennial International Medal in 1988 from Melbourne Poetry Society for his poem anthology, Reactions, published in 1986. He was one of the 56 Tamil personalities covered in Arunthondu Aatriya Tamizhaga Andhanargal, a compilation of biographies, published in Tamil language.

They ask candidates running of office to share their science policy perspectives before Election Day so that every politician arrives in office prepared to meet the 21st centuries greatest challenges on day one. Driven by the vital role that science and technology play in the health, environmental, and economic well-being of society, Science Debate strives to provide voters with sufficient and meaningful information on these key issues when electing people to serve in public office. The organization has the support of 24 Nobel laureates; 172 leaders of scientific institutions; 108 university presidents and provosts; and 55 current and former business leaders (such as company presidents, CEOs, and chairpersons). Well-known signatories include: actors Johnny Depp and Mark Ruffalo, presidential science adviser John Holdren, former energy secretary Steven Chu, inventor Elon Musk, actor/producer David Schwimmer, and educator Bill Nye.  History  = Founding of Science Debate = In the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, the lack of discussion about science and technology issues caught the attention of film director and screenwriter Matthew Chapman. Together with science journalist Chris Mooney, science writer Sheril Kirshenbaum, screenwriter and science advocate Shawn Lawrence Otto, theoretical physicist and cosmologist Lawrence Krauss, and science philosopher Austin Dacey, Science Debate 2008 was created. Shortly thereafter, Science Cheerleader founder Darlene Cavalier and science advocate Michael Halpern joined the team. Within weeks of its founding, people and organizations from across the political spectrum signed on directly. This included prominent institutions such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the U.S. National Academies, as well as political movers ranging from John Podesta, President Bill Clinton‚Äôs former chief of staff, on the left to Newt Gingrich, former House Speaker, on the right. Collectively, by counting the members in the signatory organizations, Science Debate represents more than 125 million people. = Science Debate in 2008 = Throughout 2008, there were many calls for the candidates to participate in a science debate. On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, then nominee Barack Obama agreed to participate in an online ‚Äúdebate.‚Äù He formed a science advisory team that included Harold Varmus to help him answer the questions. Days later, Senator John McCain agreed to a ‚Äúdebate‚Äù in this format as well. The candidates‚Äô answers to ‚ÄúThe Fourteen Top Science Questions Facing America,‚Äù covering climate change, energy, health care, space, the environment, and the research drivers of economic competitiveness were published in Nature. Science Debate's story and the candidates' responses made nearly a billion media impressions. = Science Debate in 2012 = In partnership with Scientific American, Science Debate got President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney to address fourteen questions on some of the biggest scientific and technological challenges facing the nation. Scientific American, the group‚Äôs media partner in 2012, published the answers and rated them based on the current science. The process of soliciting responses from the candidates and subsequent analysis of the answers was the subject of much conversation in the media during both the primaries and general election. = Science Debate in 2016 = For the 2016 election cycle, Science Debate signed with a major television network as a media partner. On October 8, 2015, Science Debate and Research!America commissioned a poll of American attitudes about science and politics. Conducted with 1,002 American adults of voting age, an overwhelming majority (87%) said it is important that candidates for President and Congress have a basic understanding of the science informing public policy issues, including majorities across the political spectrum (92% of Democrats, 90% of Republicans, and 79% of Independents). Americans also said the presidential candidates should participate in a debate to discuss key science-based challenges facing the United States, such as healthcare, climate change, energy, education, innovation and the economy (91% of Democrats, 88% of Republicans and 78% of Independents). The poll prompted major news outlets to ask why the candidates aren't addressing science issues. On January 11, 2016, Science Debate released a PSA in which children ask the candidates for President to discuss various scientific issues including climate change, clean drinking water and the honey bee colony collapse problem. The video garnered significant media coverage, inspiring writers to echo the children's call for increased discussion of science. On August 10 2016, Science Debate released the 20 top science questions. All four major candidates: President Donald Trump, Senator Hillary Clinton, Governor Gary Johnson, and Jill Stein responded in writing to the 2016 Science Debate Q&A.;‚Äù = Science Debate in 2018 = In 2018, Science Debate expanded to ask all 2018 House, Senate and Gubernatorial candidates to participate in answering 10 questions about science policy.

He was Minister of PTT from 1951 to 1953, and Minister of Reconstruction from 1955 to 1956. After leaving politics he became involved in film production. Early years (1904‚Äì39) Roger Duchet was born on 4 July 1904 in Lyon, Rhone. He was a veterinarian by profession. He attended the Veterinary School of Lyon, and graduated in 1928. He set up in practice as a vetinerarian in Beaune in 1928, where he married Simone Serre. In 1931 he was President of the Union of Livestock Breeders. Duchet was elected mayor of Beaune as a Radical Socialist in October 1932. At the age of 28 he was the youngest mayor in France. He chaired the Radical Socialist Federation of C√¥te d‚ÄôOr. In 1937 he was elected to the general council of the C√¥te-d'Or as representative of Beaune-Sud. He was an energetic and efficient mayor of Beaune. He modernized the city and reorganized the public services. He created a large school, kindergartens, a summer camp, and other improvements. He revived trade fairs and wine festivals, and promoted agriculture in the region. World War II (1939‚Äì45) During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Duchet was mobilized in 1939 as a lieutenant-veterinarian. He was taken prisoner, and released at the end of 1940. During the war Duchet supported Marshal Philippe P√©tain. For this, he was deposed on 9 September 1944 after the Liberation of France and replaced by Mr. Louis Lozerand, head of the cantonal council of Liberation of Beaune. However, he was reelected in May 1945. He was then elected councilor-general of Beaune. Post-war politics (1946‚Äì65) On 8 December 1946 Duchet was elected to the Council of the Republic for C√¥te d'Or. He helped organize the right-wing Independent Republican group. He was reelected on 7 November 1948, and sat on the Finance and Press committees. In 1949 Duchet, Ren√© Coty and Jean Boivin-Champeaux created the Centre National des Ind√©pendants (CNI, National Center of Independents), which became the main party of the French Fourth Republic. Duchet also founded the journal France Ind√©pendante. During the 1950s Duchet became more conservative. He fought against communism and was in favor of a French Algeria. In the second cabinet of Ren√© Pleven he was Secretary of State for Public works from 11 August 1951 to 4 October 1951, then Minister of Posts, Telegraphs, and Telephones. He retained the PTT portfolio in the cabinets of Edgar Faure, Antoine Pinay and Ren√© Mayer until 28 June 1953. He was Minister of Reconstruction and Housing from 23 February 1955 to 1 February 1956. He was reelected to the Senate on 19 June 1955. During the French Fifth Republic Duchet was elected to the Senate on 26 April 1959, and was reelected on 23 September 1962. He belonged to the Groupe des R√©publicains et Ind√©pendants (Group of Republicans and Independents). The CNI went into decline during the Algerian War. Duchet was often absent from Beaune. and resigned as mayor in 1965. Later career (1965‚Äì81) After leaving politics, Duchet became interested in the cinema. In 1963 he married Andr√©e Debar, an actress. After 1965 he appears to have stopped participating in the Senate. He owned the company Euro-France Films, which produced several feature films in the 1960s and 1970s. These included the French productions Le gentleman de Cocody by Christian-Jaque (1965) and Monsieur Papa by Philippe Monnier (1977), and also international co- productions such as Cosa nostra (1972, The Valachi Papers) directed by Terence Young and starring Charles Bronson and Lino Ventura. Duchet did not run for a third Senate term, and ended his mandate on 1 October 1971. In 1975 he published his memoirs of the Fourth Republic, La R√©publique √©pingl√©e (The Pinned Republic). The bitter work gave a series of often-cruel portraits of politicians. He died on 6 September 1981 in Paris aged 77. Publications * Le Contr√¥le laitier, Semur-en-Auxois, A.

He began as an abstract expressionist painter, but his work has evolved to more figurative works with a particular emphasis on portraiture. Early life and education O'Sullivan studied initially at the National College of Art and Design and finished his education at the Limerick School of Art and Design, finishing in 2000. Career After working in Dundalk, for six years teaching art, O'Sullivan returned to Limerick where he was a member of Contact Studios for six years. He has been a portrait artist for twenty years, but later moved into life painting, combining non-traditional techniques, including dripping paints, splats and blobs of paint, scraping, scratching as well as more conventional painting methods into a complex layering process. He also works with various transparencies and glazes, drying at different rates to achieve a contrast of textures. Amongst these textures and colours, sometimes hidden, sometimes not, are figures within the scene. Each piece has its own mood or theme but the interpretation of such is often left up to the viewer. He has a number of works in both private and public collections, including the County Louth Municipal Collection, the Law Library Collection (Dublin) and he had a piece acquired by the Irish Contemporary Arts Society which they donated to the Butler Gallery Collection, Kilkenny. O'Sullivan's paintings were displayed in a solo exhibition at the Basement Gallery of An T√°in Arts Centre in 2008 and again in 2014.

Bach's G minor fugue is \\"insistent and pathetic\\". The subject also appears in his funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit (God's time is the very best time).AEF Dickinson The subject of the fugue employs a minor 6th leap in the first measure, then resolves it with a more conventional stepwise motion. Overall, the piece has a foreboding and admonishing tone.  Harmonic analysis  The prelude and the fugue of BWV 861 are set in G minor, requiring a key signature of two flats. = Prelude = The first two measures of the prelude are an elaboration of tonic. There is a chain of suspensions in m. 3 that leads to the secondary dominant (A major) that leads to the dominant (D major), which then leads back to tonic (G minor). The 5th measure begins with a ii-V-I progression and leads to a C dominant seventh chord. This marks the beginning of a series of modulations moving up a fourth each time. He modulates twice, arriving in B major for the recapitulation of the opening theme in m. 1. A G dominant seventh chord is used in the fourth beat of m 8. Measure 9 marks the beginning of a sequence that lasts two measures and further establishes C minor as tonic. There is another recapitulation of the opening measure in mm. 11, this time in C minor. There is a diminished triad on beat 3 of mm. 12 and a D dominant seventh on the fourth beat as we prepare to modulate back to G minor. There is another C minor chord on the third beat of mm. 13, which turns into a Neapolitan sixth when the top line lands on an A on the fourth beat. The next measure begins on D, which leads to G minor for the second beat. Tonic (G minor) is then elaborated until mm. 17. There is another Neapolitan chord that leads to a diminished chord on the raised fourth scale degree, providing a leading tone to the D dominant seventh chord with a 4-3 suspension in the soprano. The penultimate measure begins with a pedal tone that last till the end of the prelude. The G minor chord is turned into a G dominant seventh as it modulates to C minor, then a C diminished triad with the pedal tone G in the bass still. Finally, the dissonance is resolved and the piece ends with a Picardy third.Example of a tonal answer in a fugal exposition = Fugue = The subject of the fugue begins in G minor. The second voice enters on the pickup to the fourth beat of m. 2, and it begins in the dominant (D minor), even though the first note of the theme is a G in this instance. The third voice enters in m. 5 in the tonic and the fourth a measure later in the dominant once again. The first episode begins in D and modulates to the B major for the recapitulation of the subject. The second episode is in G minor, and it remains in G minor until the end of the piece  References   Sources  * Bach Digital Work Nos. and at *Boalch, Donald Howard; Mould, Charles; Roth, Andreas H.

He co-founded the USSR Science School of Computational Optics and discovered several optical phenomena, including aberration vignetting (1938), projection centre distortion (1957), and existence of second-order aberration (1986). The phenomenon of projection centre distortion became the basis for engineering photometry.–†—É—Å–∏–Ω–æ–≤ –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á. ITMO Virtual Museum Biography Rusinov was born into the family of a high school mathematics teacher. His father Mikhail Nikolaevich Rusinov () taught at The N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov Saint Petersburg State Conservatory. His mother Evdokiya Vasil'yevna Rusinova () studied piano under Anton Rubinstein. Many well-known Russian composers were family friends, including Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. Mikhail Rusinov inherited his mother's love of music and composed waltzes as an adult. Rusinov attended school from 1917 to 1920; in 1921 he entered a trade school that eventually became the Professional School of Precise Mechanics and Optics. In 1921 it became a Technical School and Precise Mechanics and Optics University. After graduation from technical school at the age of 18, Rusinov joined the Leningrad Optical Mechanical Association (LOMO) as an optician designer. There he performed calculations for submarine periscopes. From 1929 till 1933 Rusinov worked at the USSR Optical and Mechanical Society. Beginning in 1931 he also worked in the Central Office of Geodesy and Cartography. From 1932 until 1942 he held positions of Senior Engineer, Head of the Laboratory and Senior Researcher in Geodesy at the Aerial Photography and Cartography Central Institute.

From 1943 till 1944 he taught at the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. Returning to St. Petersburg in October 1944, he became the Scientific Supervisor of the North-East Aerogeodesy Institute Laboratory of Optics and Mechanics. In 1946 he received a permanent position at ITMO. In 1958 he worked on design of wide angle lenses at the Geodesy, Aerophotography and Cartography Central Research Institute. Rusinov's scientific work is closely associated with ITMO University. He worked at ITMO from its foundation, holding the position of Department Head for more than 40 years and was Scientific Supervisor of its laboratory, which later became the Technical Optics Laboratory. He became Professor of the Applied and Computational Optics Department in 1997. Rusinov wrote more than 152 scientific papers (18 monographs), and held 320 Inventor's Certificates and 22 patents (7 in the Russian Federation). In 1995 he published a monograph on Off-Centre Optical Systems Composition. He received most of his state awards for development of wide-angle lenses for aerophotography.\\"Russian Genius\\", Volume 12, ITMO Press, 2011 Rusinov died on 29 September 2004. He was buried at Volkovo Cemetery in St. Petersburg.

She continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1945 and was elected as a Member of the Royal West of England Academy in 1949. Notable exhibitions Garstin's works were considered tonal and she was able to contrast temperature with different colours and tones. Her best known exhibitions include the Adams Gallery, Pall Mall, London in 1940 which was a solo exhibition of over 60 paintings, highlights being \\"Penzance Promenade\\" and \\"Penzance Harbour\\". The Western Morning News described the latter as \\"something of the effective simplicity and artistic economy of selection that the best modern French paintings have.\\" In the United Services Centre, Plymouth in 1945, where Garstin put on a joint exhibition with Newlyn painter Gertrude Harvey. and she put on a joint exhibition with her father's works entitled Norman and Alethea Garstin.

History  The first recorded Baptist worship in Shirley took place in 1797, when a group from Cannon Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, under their Minister, Rev. Samuel Pearce, held meetings in a former pub on the corner of what is now Stratford Road and Olton Road. In 1845 the congregation moved to their own Chapel in the Sandy Hill Farm area. The current church building was constructed in 1910, funded by Mr. and Mrs. Robert Braithwaite, in memory of Mrs Braithwaite's parents Mr. and Mrs. Guy. For that reason the church is officially known as the Guy Memorial Chapel. Halls to the rear of the church were added in 1913 and extended in the 1930s including a caretakers house. These halls and caretakers house were demolished in 2012. In 2013 a new set of church buildings was opened by the Deputy Mayor of Solihull, councillor Ken Hawkins.

Abel, was an Indian Syro-Malabar Catholic CMI priest, journalist, and lyricist, best known as the founding father of Kalabhavan, a centre for learning performance arts in Kochi, India. Fr. Abel, with the help of K. K. Antony, a music teacher, and Yesudas, then a budding playback singer, started Kalabhavan as the Christian Arts Club to promote Christian music, in the year 1969. Soon, with the support of Major Archbishop Mar Joseph Parecattil and the Archdiocese of Eranakulam, the Club was registered as Kalabhavan. Early life and education Fr. Abel was born on 19 January 1920 in Mulakulam village ( near Piravom ) as Mathew to Periyappuram Mathen Vidyan and Aleyamma, as their fifth child. In the 1940s, he set out for pastoral studies at Mannanam, Thevara and Koonammavu. He later went to Mangalore and was ordained as a priest in 1951. Career In 1952, he joined the Deepika Daily at Kottayam as a journalist. The next year, he left for Rome, where, from the International University of Rome, he took a Doctorate in Journalism and Political Science. On returning to Kerala, he rejoined the Deepika Daily, where he worked as an Assistant Managing Director, till 1961. During this time, he started writing lyrics and poetry. He was then entrusted with a job of a professor at St. Joseph's College, Devagiri. On the request of Joseph Parecattil, Fr. Abel moved to Ernakulam to translate Christian prayer books from Syriac to Malayalam. This gave him the idea of writing original devotional songs in Malayalam. He penned the lyrics to numerous songs which were set to music by K. K. Antony. Their music was successful among the public as well as with the clergy. Kalabhavan was started in 1963 to train young artists in formal music education. Death Fr. Abel died on 27 October 2001, at the age of 81 at Thodupuzha, following a cardiac arrest. His body was kept at Ernakulam Town Hall for the public to pay homage, two days later.

Life and work  Sibel Arslan is of Zaza origin, and arrived in Switzerland in 1991 with her mother and two brothers. Her father had already arrived six years previously as a refugee. The family settled in Kleinbasel. In 2002, she graduated from the Gymnasium B√§umlihof in Basel. She studied law at the University of Basel and graduated in 2011. In 2004 she became a Swiss citizen and is a Turkish and Swiss dual citizen. Along with her brother, Arslan managed the shisha bar 'Susam' in Barf√ºsserplatz from 2006 to 2007. Arslan has been working as a legal advisor to the Basel Gewerkschaftsbund since 2012. From 2013 to 2015 she was a career adviser at the Office for Counseling and Adult Protection of the Canton of Basel-Stadt. Since March 2015 she has worked as a lawyer in the General Secretariat of the Security Directorate of the Canton of Basel-Landschaft. Arslan joined BastA! in 2004, a leftist ecological party in the canton of Basel-Stadt. BastA is a member of the Green Party of Switzerland. From 2005 to 2016 she sat in the Grand Council of the Canton of Basel-Stadt. From 2007, she became a member of the Justice, Safety and Sports Commission and, from 2013, the Pardon Commission. In the Swiss parliamentary elections in 2015 she was elected to the National Council. She is a member of the Foreign Policy Commission and the Legal Commission. At the end of 2014, the Basellandschaftliche Regierungsrat Security Director Isaac Reber revoked an agreed appointment of Arslan as head of the cantonal penal sanctions and measures committee, after the Basler Zeitung had led a campaign against her. The newspaper had alleged lack of qualifications and debts of about 60,000 Swiss francs. These claims covered three agreements that Arslan had also mentioned in the application process. The fact that these claims were recorded in the debt collection register \\"was not clarified in all media reports\\". At the time of Arslan's application, only a residual debt of CHF 5,000 had to be paid. This happened within a short time. Arslan was elected to the National Council in the 2015 Swiss federal election. On 30 November 2015 she took the oath of office. The ceremony was held in Bern. In Parliament she joined the fraction of the Green Party of Switzerland. In October 2019 she was re-elected to the National Council.

Metodolog√≠a para el Desarrollo Econ√≥mico Local, Direcci√≥n de Desarrollo y Gesti√≥n Local. The local development approach considers the endogenous potentialities of territories. Economic and non economic factors influence local development processes. Among the non economic factors, social, cultural, historical, institutional, and geographical aspects can be decisive in the process of local economic development.ALBUQUERQUE, Francisco, Llorens Juan y Del Castillo Jaime (2002). \\"Estudio de casos de desarrollo econ√≥mico local en Am√©rica Latina\\". Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, Departamento de Desarrollo Sostenible, Washington D.C.  Definition  In this perspective, local economic development can be defined as a process of transformation of the local economy and society, oriented to surpass the difficulties and existent challenges. It seeks to improve the conditions of life of local population by means of actions concerted between the different local agents, social, public and private, towards an efficient and sustainable use of the existent endogenous resources.HELMSING B. (2001). \\"Partnerships, Meso-institutions and Learning. New local and regional economic development initiatives in Latin America\\". Institute of Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands. In this approach, the importance of social capital and the links of cooperation with external agents to capture human, monetary and technical resources contribute to the local development strategy.Pike A.

Into Film aims to put film at the heart of children and young people‚Äôs educational, cultural and personal development. More than half of UK schools engage with Into Film‚Äôs programme of Into Film Clubs, special cinema screenings, educational resources and training to support classroom teaching. Into Film aims to provide 5-19-year olds with opportunities to learn about and with film and develop a passion for cinema. Into Film runs two flagship annual events: The Into Film Festival, which enables more than 400,000 children and young people to access the cinema for free, and the Into Film Awards, which celebrates the filmmaking and learning achievements of pupils and educators from across the UK. Into Film also engages in ongoing educational research, including live action-research projects in schools, to provide evidence of the impact on pupil engagement and attainment when teaching and learning with film.  History  Into Film was founded in 2013 as the result of a merger between two charities ‚Äì Film Club and First Light. Since its inception, Paul Reeve MBE has been the CEO of Into Film.  Into Film Programme  = Into Film Clubs = Into Film Club is an extra-curricular activity that enables educators to bring young people together and inspire a passion for film and film learning in young audiences. Clubs in school settings tend to be run by teachers, and usually take place after school or during break times, while some clubs are run in other settings, such as libraries and youth clubs. Into Film Clubs seek to offer a safe and inclusive environment for UK children and young people to develop skills and explore their love of film. Club members are encouraged to develop literacy skills by writing reviews of the films they have seen, while thousands of educators use Into Film Clubs to reinforce curricular learning, develop transferable skills and increase pupil motivation. = Resources = Into Film has developed thousands of educational resources that utilise the medium of film to support curriculum learning. Into Film resources feature relevant film content embedded directly into ready-to- use downloadable PowerPoints with teachers‚Äô notes. Into Film also work with film distributors to develop resources in support of new cinema releases to create a wide range of unique educational experiences. Into Film‚Äôs Wonder Park partnership with Paramount Pictures reached the shortlist for The Screen Awards Brand Partnership of the Year 2019. Into Film‚Äôs resources also seek to support pupil wellbeing and schools to use film as an effective tool for exploring potentially sensitive topics, as represented through resources around anti-bullying, mental wellbeing and staying safe online. = Training = Into Film offer Professional development training to educators. Training is created with input from specialist partners, including teachers and senior school leaders across the UK, to support teachers in using film as a tool for learning across the curriculum. As a result of the successful conclusion of a Paul Hamlyn Foundation-supported Full STEAM Ahead project, Into Film was awarded a further four-year grant for Film for Learning (FFL), an initiative designed to improve pupils‚Äô literacy and develop teachers as film club leaders within their schools. Into Film also launched a teacher development programme for members of the National Education Union, which piloted blended learning with face-to-face sessions supported by Into Film‚Äôs online training platform.  Into Film Festival  The annual Into Film Festival is the largest free youth film festival in the world, and delivers thousands of free events and screenings, in partnership with industry distributors and exhibitors. According to Into Film, over 2.5 million pupils and teachers across the UK have been to the cinema for no cost as part of the Festival since the first edition in 2013. The Festival programme includes specialist films and exclusive previews of upcoming blockbusters, as well as inclusive SEN and autism-friendly screenings. The Festival also provides opportunities for audience members to interact with film industry talent, with many events featuring Q&A; sessions with actors, directors and other filmmaking professionals. Opening films at the Festival in recent years have included exclusive previews of 2040, The Grinch, He Named Me Malala and Paddington 2, while closing films have included previews of Coco, Frozen II and Ralph Breaks the Internet.

It was released on October 13, 2015. Like the preceding novel, the title comes from the hymn \\"Onward, Christian Soldiers\\" (second stanza).  Plot  Merlin Athrawes is confronted by Aivah Pahrshan, who reveals to him her suspicions that he and Ahbraim Zhevons are one and the same and that she had been tracking his activities for several years now. She reveals that she is the leader of the \\"Sisterhood of Saint Kohdy,\\" an ancient secret society founded after the death of Seijin Kohdy (who was previously believed to be mythical) under suspicious circumstances; the Church subsequently deleted his existence from its official record and annihilated the original Abbey of Saint Kohdy in a Rakurai strike. Aivah also reveals that Kohdy's tomb, journal and sword (\\"Helm Cleaver\\") were all relocated before the destruction of the Abbey and that large portions of the journal are in Spanish, a language the Sisterhood cannot understand. Despite the grave risks involved, the Inner Circle decides to bring Aivah and her personal maid Sandaria to Nimue's Cave and expose them to the complete truth, a truth that shocks them to their very core; neither suspected (despite the Sisterhood's essential doubts about some of the \\"archangels\\" and the Church) that the Holy Writ itself was based on falsehoods. Eventually, both accept the truth. The Spanish portions of Saint Kohdy's journal are translated and the Inner Circle discovers previously unknown details about the War Against the Fallen. Saint Kohdy was in fact Sergeant Major Cody Cortazar, late of the Terran Federation Marine Corps. He had been drafted due to his combat skills and training by the surviving command crew to combat the \\"Fallen Angels\\" and their \\"mortal\\" supporters while winning the support of the ignorant population. To accomplish this, the command crew had sought to selectively reactivate his suppressed memories and in doing so had allowed him to remember his native tongue and fragments of his previous life on Earth. His experiences against someone the church had ruled a \\"demon\\" had shaken him to the point of questioning the \\"archangels\\" and he sought to meet with Schueler himself for reassurance (a meeting from which he did not return alive). Ultimately, the Inner Circle and Sisterhood agree to work together, and Merlin travels to Zion in disguise to make contact with the Sisterhoods' agents there. In northern Siddarmark, Baron Green Valley takes troops specialized in winter combat and seizes key positions to the north of Bishop Militant Bahrnabai Wyrshym's positions in the Sylmahn Gap. Despite the wisdom of pulling Wyrshym and his troops back, the Grand Inquisitor refuses to yield any ground. Having blocked the Church's forces from the north, the allies subsequently attack Wyrshym's positions from the south in the Gap. With Harchong's relief force still five-days away from being able to relieve him and after sustaining heavy losses, Wyrshym is forced to surrender. Green Valley then orders the liberation of as many of the Church's concentration camps while Merlin, whose assassination of specific inquisitors and overzealous church guardsman cause the Inquisition to tone down its atrocities, rescues a family of \\"suspected heretics\\" and brings them to the Cave. They're given a new chance to rebuild their lives elsewhere. In the south, the Dohlaran Army is forced to retreat while Bishop Militant Cahnyr Kaitswyrth's forces are surrounded and defeated by the Allies (Kaitswyrth subsequently commits suicide). In the aftermath of such massive reversals, Vicar Zhaspahr Clyntahn attempts to have Maigwair removed from his position through political maneuvering. However, the secret meeting of his loyalists at a secluded church in Zion is bombed by the Sisterhoods' agents (named the \\"Fist of God\\") with Merlin's help. The attack, coupled with Maigwair's swift action to secure his position and the propaganda broadsheets claiming responsibility for this attack (as well as for the assassination of other vicars), seriously undermines Clyntahn's position and the Inquisition's aura of invincibility. However, the evidence leads Wyllym Rayno, Chyntahn's second in command in the Inquisition, to conclude that the Fist of God is indeed, in league with \\"demons.\\" In Dohlar, Ahlverez finds himself fighting for his political career after his defeat in Siddarmark. Meanwhile, Dohlar's new \\"screw galleys\\" are pitted against a Charisian squadron of galleons and one ironclad with both sides sustaining heavy losses. The battle ends with a Dohlaran victory and the capture of the iron clad and over 500 Charisian seamen, though some Charisian ships escape. Despite attempts by the Dohlaran leadership to convince the Church otherwise, Clyntahn demands the extradition of all the Charisian prisoners for a huge auto-da-f√© in Zion, with the intent to shore up the Inquisition's position in the eyes of the faithful. Hektor Aplyn-Ahrmahk and Baron Sarmouth (a recent inductee to the Inner Circle), with the assistance of the SNARCs, lead a daring nighttime mission to save the Charisian prisoners from the church's ships and return the Dohlaran prisoners from the raid back to Gorath. His plans for the prisoners in ruins, a furious Clyntahn orders the arrest of all the Dohlaran officers involved but is swayed (barely) by Rayno's logical argument that doing so might damage the war effort, as the Dohlaran Navy has provided the only victory against Charis that year. Clyntahn, still suspicious of the Dohlaran Navy's commander, \\"invites\\" Thirsk's family for their pilgrimage to Zion. Anticipating these actions, Merlin and Nimue intercept the ship carrying Thirsk's daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren, rescuing his family and blowing the ship up in the middle of the sea to eliminate any witnesses. In the aftermath of their presumed deaths, a deeply depressed Thirsk contemplates what he is likely to be forced to say in support of the Church's version (that his family died in a battle with Charisian ships). The book concludes when he is suddenly interrupted by Merlin Athrawes, in his own townhouse study, who tells him that they \\"need to talk.\\"  References   External links  * Hell's Foundations Quiver at Collected Driblets of Baen * http://us.macmillan.com/mobile/book/9780765321879 * https://www.amazon.com/Hells-Foundations-Quiver-Safehold- David/dp/0765321874/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1419778632&sr;=1-1&keywords;=hells+foundations+quiver Category:2015 American novels Category:Novels by David Weber Category:American science fiction novels Category:Tor Books books ","title":"Hell's Foundations Quiver"},{"id":"48292929","title":"Jag g√•r nu"},{"id":"48292932","text":"Havi Schanz also known as Havi Art, was born in Argentina in Santa Fe City.

It was proposed by the federal government of Nigeria in 2012 under the Jonathan Administration and was fully implemented by the Buhari Administration. to consolidate all inflows from all agencies of government into a single account at the Central Bank of Nigeria. Background Efficient management and control of government's cash resources rely on government banking arrangements. Nigeria, like many low income countries, employed fragmented systems in handling government receipts and payments. Establishing a unified structure as recommended by the IMF, where all government funds are collected in one account would reduce borrowing costs, extend credit and improve government's fiscal policy among other benefits to government. The IMF also recommends the establishment of a legal basis to ensure its robustness and stability. The introduction of the Treasury Single Account policy therefore was vital in reducing the proliferation of bank accounts operated by ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) towards promoting financial accountability among governmental organs. The compliance of the policy in Nigeria created challenges for majority of the MDAs. Commercial banks in Nigeria remitted over 2 trillion Naira worth of idle and active governments deposits with full implementation of this policy in 2016. Meanwhile, the bankers committee of the country has declared their support for the policy. Through Remita, the integrated electronic payments and collections platform developed by a company called [http://www.systemspecs.com.ng SystemSpecs, the TSA initiative has enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria to take full control of over 3 trillion Naira ($15 billion) of its cash assets as at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Reactions to the introduction of Treasury Single Account  The operation of the Treasury Single Account in Nigeria has not been without controversies. On Tuesday, 10 November 2015, Dino Melaye, a Nigerian senator representing Kogi West, raised a motion that the operation of the treasury single account (TSA) be investigated for possible corruption. He claimed that \\"the appointment of REMITA, an e-collection agent, is a gross violation of section 162 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution and the banks and other Financial Institutions Act.\\" He claimed the constitution only recognised a banking institution to be the collector of government funds, that Remita was not a bank. The provision of the Constitution cited by Melaye states, ‚Äúthe federation shall maintain a special account to be called the federation account into which all revenues collected by the government of the federation except the proceeds from the personal income tax of the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Federation, the Nigeria Police Force, the ministry or department of government charged with foreign affairs and the residents of the FCT, Abuja.‚Äù According to Melaye, the total inflow of 1% commission charged and received by SystemSpecs for all revenue collected on behalf of the government from the various ministries, departments and agencies to be 25 billion Naira as of November, 2015 was fraud and must be returned to the account of the Central Bank of Nigeria. The senate consequently ordered its committee on finance and public accounts to \\"commence an investigation into the use of Remita (which it erroneously described as an e-collection agent) since the inception of the TSA policy. Ayo Fayose, Governor of Ekiti State, introduced a political angle to the controversy when he alleged that the funds collected through of TSA were used to finance governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States by the All Progressives Congress, apart from enriching \\"a single company in one month.\\" 25 billion Naira is the negotiated commission of one per cent of 2.5 trillion Naira - total amount of monies collected by Remita for the Federal Government of Nigeria. However, the Federal Government of Nigeria through the office of The Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed debunked the opinion that the TSA policy was not intended to loot the Nigeria treasury. The minister in his statement attempted to absolve the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari when he claimed that the TSA contract was signed during the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan The CBN in an attempt to justify their position released a letter to the press titled ‚ÄúCommencement of Federal Government independent revenue collection under the Treasury Single Account (TSA) initiative‚Äù. In the letter, the CBN debunked all the allegations made by Melaye as being misleading. At the height of the controversy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), instructed SystemSpecs to return of all the revenues made so far on the contract, a directive, which SystemSpecs obeyed without delay as a \\"business decision\\". In a letter reportedly written to President Muhammadu Buhari by John Obaro, Founder and Managing Director of SystemSpecs, developers of the Remita application, the allegation that SystemSpecs pocketed 25 billion Naira was refuted. Obaro explained that the one per cent commission was negotiated prior to the signing of the contract; and the one per cent commission was shared by SystemSpecs, participating commercial banks and the Central Bank of Nigeria in the ratio of 50:40:10 respectively. According to findings by PremiumTimes,'Remita' is not \\"an agency\\" but an application/software for executing payment instructions and collection of government revenue. The software facilitates the payment of government revenue from financial institutions to a TSA in the CBN. The report cited holes in Melaye's accusations and termed them \\"misleading.\\" The Joint Senate investigative committee absolved SystemSpecs of any wrongdoing as ‚Äúthe committee could not ascertain the deduction/collection of twenty-five billion Naira (N25 billion) by SystemSpecs as 1% fee charged for the use of its Remita platform within the period under investigation.‚Äù This was contained in section 6.1.16 on pages 16 and 17 of the committee‚Äôs report.

Rentschler is a scholar of feminist media studies and associate professor at McGill University located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Rentschler's work focuses on how media produces culture and its effects on women's lives and the reproduction of rape culture. She advocates anti- violence through the production of media to reduce violent crime.  Background  Carrie A. Rentschler is a William Dawson Scholar in Feminist Media Studies. She was the director of the Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies at McGill University from 2011 to 2015. At the Institute, Rentschler teaches courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. These courses include feminist media studies, media and the politics of emotion and affect, cultural studies of news, crime/media/culture, and feminist theories and methods. Rentschler earned her BA magna cum laude in Humanities from the University of Minnesota in 1994, she received both her MA and PhD in Communications from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998 and 2002 respectively.  Research interests  Rentschler's research interests center around media, pertaining to media as a cultural producer in representations of physical victimization and psychological trauma, and how these representations serve to inform viewers opinions about war, terrorism, citizenship and crime. She pays particular focus as to how these issues specifically impact women's lives. Several examples of Rentschler conducting feminist research include, the disproportionate criminalization and incarceration of women of colour in the justice system, as well as her research into using social media as a tool to inform, empower women and expose the perpetrators of rape culture, in an effort to halt the perpetuation of rape culture. Rentschler also believes that women may feel more empowered by engaging in self-defense strategies.  Notable work  Rentschler's 2014 article called \\"Rape Culture and the Feminist Politics of Social Media\\" provides an overview of how a younger generation of feminists is combating rape culture primarily through social media. According to the paper, this movement has given more attention to street harassment, rape jokes and in some cases sexual assault than what is often present in reports by the police, mainstream news media and school authorities. Rentschler notes that some women are posting pictures of their harassers, often taken with their cell phones, out of solidarity and so that other women can be forewarned. She goes on to argue that such practices can reduce the feelings of victimization and helplessness. This leads to the statement that younger women are more likely to rely on their cell phones as personal devices of safety than pepper spray and whistles. In 2019, Rentschler provided testimony in support of the Nova Scotia Registrar of Motor Vehicles and their previous decision to revoke a license plate bearing the last name of its owner Lorne Grabher. She said \\"as someone seeing this licence plate, you would have no idea this is a name\\" and argued that its approval would lead to conditions that are conducive to sexual harassment. Rentschler's first book called Second Wounds: Victim's Rights and the Media in the U.S. was published by Duke University Press in 2011. Second Wounds focuses on sensationalized reports that cover crime stories in a way that is alienating toward victims. Examples of this include stories that give undue publicity to the perpetrator. Rentschler's work explores this in the context of secondary victimization in which survivors of sexual assault can have their trauma exacerbated by institutional neglect on the part of police and court officers. Her second book, Girlhood and the Politics of Place was released in 2016 under a Creative Commons license. In between the two publications, Rentschler discussed the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese as a topic for upcoming work about the bystander effect.  Personal views  Rentschler advocates for an anti-violence rather than a crime control model in reducing crime. This means that people can learn about the sources of certain social problems and the necessary social steps for prevention, to reduce the chances of the crime occurring in the first place. One example is feminist intervention in domestic violence; by using media such as television commercials, and posters on college campuses offering help for those in need, people may be more likely to seek assistance and become more informed of the issues, which can be a step forward in reducing its overall incidence.

He returned to Returned to Illinois Wesleyan University in 1945. In 1948 Love accepted the position of dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Denver, where he worked until becoming president of the University of Nevada in 1950.Illinois Wesleyan University Bulletin September 1948 University of Nevada Love came to the university with the strongest credentials of any chief administrator thus far. His short tenure at the University of Nevada was fraught with budgetary fights with the Nevada legislature. Love was responsible for establishing the Las Vegas campus in 1951, which would go on to become the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In 1950 and 1951, enrollment declined at the university as the number of veterans studying on the GI Bill gradually decreased. The 1951 session of the legislature drastically cut funding for the university. In early 1952 Love resigned his presidency, suggesting the board of regents name Minard W. Stout as his successor.Glass, Al and Mary Glass. 1981. Nevada's Turbulent '50s: Decade of Political and Economic Change. Reno, NV: University of Nevada Press. San Diego State Love arrived at what was then San Diego State College in 1952. His 19-year tenure was transformative. He helped the institution grow from a liberal arts college into a comprehensive university. In 1966, the Carnegie Corporation named Dr. Love one of the best college presidents in the country. His dream of upgrading the school to university status was achieved in 1971. When he retired later that year, student enrollment had reached more than 30,000, and full-time faculty rose to 1,128.Malcolm A.

She was reburied in an unmarked grave at Soquel Cemetery. Lamaster's body remained unidentified till 2013, for nineteen years until the comparison of familial DNA and a finger print card revealed her identity. Until then, she was referred to as Pogonip Jane by investigators and media. Physical characteristics and clothing The decomposed remains of a white female were found in a shallow grave near a homeless campsite on January 19, 1994 in Pogonip Park in Santa Cruz, California. It was discovered by two hikers looking for mushrooms. The victim was identified as being in her late teens with brown hair cut short and pink fingernails. Her death was estimated to have occurred a couple of weeks prior to the discovery; the cause of death was ruled to be bludgeoning with a metal object most likely a pipe that had crushed her skull. Due to advanced decomposition, it was hard to ascertain her facial features. A tiny heart was discovered tattooed between her left thumb and index finger. Her teeth had a few cavities that had been filled in with porcelain. Isotopic hair analysis revealed she had traveled between Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz (she lived in Pacifica) prior to her death. Investigation Clay reconstruction of the victim The Santa Cruz Police Department got a fresh impetus to investigate the case when its original investigator Butch Baker was murdered in an unrelated crime. They decided to work towards solving the case in Baker's honor. Strategies taken subsequently in an attempt to arrive at an identification included the creation of a clay model reconstruction based on the skull of the victim. Identification Lamaster's family did not file a missing person report for her until 2007. The reason for the delay in filing a report was not revealed due to privacy reasons. A DNA sample from her biological mother was submitted and the State Department of Justice lab announced a familial match in October 2013 with DNA taken from the victim's body that had been entered into their system earlier. Contact with Lamaster's sister in the state of Washington provided a fingerprint card taken when Lamaster was young which was then used to match prints taken during her autopsy. A father and son who had been seen travelling with Lamaster have been identified as persons of interest. The son has since died, while the father, Wayne White, resided in eastern Tennesseekorilamaster17.com for a period but has since also died.

It involves the reaction of an independently generated carbon-centered radical with an atomic fluorine source and yields an organofluorine compound. frameless Historically, only three atomic fluorine sources were available for radical fluorination: Fluorine (F2), hypofluorites (O‚ÄîF based reagents) and XeF2. Their high reactivity, and the difficult handling of F2 and the hypofluorites, limited the development of radical fluorination compared to electrophilic and nucleophilic methods. The uncovering of the ability of electrophilic N‚ÄîF fluorinating agents to act as atomic fluorine source led to a renaissance in radical fluorination. Various methodologies have since been developed for the radical formation of C‚ÄîF bonds. The radical intermediates have been generated from carboxylic acids and boronic acid derivatives, by radical addition to alkenes, or C‚ÄîH bond and C‚ÄîC bond activations. New sources of atomic fluorine are now emerging, such as metal-fluoride complexes.  Sources of atomic fluorine  = Fluorine gas = Fluorine can act both as an electrophilic and atomic source of fluorine. The weak F‚ÄîF bond strength () allows for homolytic cleavage. The reaction of F2 with organic compounds is, however, highly exothermic and can lead to non- selective fluorinations and C‚ÄîC cleavage, as well as explosions. Only a few selective radical fluorination methods have been reported. The use of fluorine for radical fluorination is mainly limited to perfluorination reactions. = O‚ÄîF reagents = The O‚ÄîF bond of hypofluorites is relatively weak. For trifluoromethyl hypofluorite (CF3OF), it was estimated to be . The ability of trifluoromethyl hypofluorite to transfer fluorine to alkyl radicals was notably demonstrated by reacting independently generated ethyl radicals from ethene and tritium in presence of CF3OF. The high reactivity of hypofluorites has limited their application to selective radical fluorination. They can, however, be used as radical initiators for polymerization. = XeF2 = XeF2 has mainly been used for radical fluorination in radical decarboxylative fluorination reactions. In this Hunsdiecker-type reaction, xenon difluoride is used to generate the radical intermediate, as well as the fluorine transfer source. frameless XeF2 can also be used to generate aryl radicals from aryl silanes, and act as atomic fluorine source to furnish aryl fluorides. 438x438px = N‚ÄîF reagents = Selectfluor and N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) are traditionally used as electrophilic sources of fluorine, but their ability to transfer fluorine to alkyl radical has recently been demonstrated. They are now commonly used as fluorine transfer agents to alkyl radicals. = Others = Examples of radical fluorination using BrF3 and fluorinated solvents have been reported. Recent examples in radical fluorination suggest that in-situ generated metal-fluoride complexes can also act as fluorine transfer agent to alkyl radicals.  Radical fluorination methodologies  = Decarboxylative fluorination = Thermolysis of t-butyl peresters has been used to generate alkyl radicals in presence of NFSI and Selectfluor. The radicals intermediates were efficiently fluorinated, demonstrating the ability of the two electrophilic fluorinating agents to transfer fluorine to alkyl radicals. 310x310px Carboxylic acids can be used as radical precursors in radical fluorination methods. Metal catalysts such as silver and manganese have been used to induce the fluorodecarboxylation. The fluorodecarboxylation of carboxylic acids can also be triggered using photoredox catalysis. More specifically, phenoxyacetic acid derivatives have been shown to undergo fluorodecarboxylation when directly exposed to UV-light irradiation or via the use of a photosensitizer. 354x354px = Radical fluorination of alkenes = Alkyl radicals generated from radical additions to alkenes have also been fluorinated. Hydrides and nitrogen-, carbon-, and phosphorus-centered radicals have been employed, yielding a wide range of fluorinated, difunctionalized compounds. = Fluorination of boronic acid derivatives = Alkyl fluorides have been synthesized via radicals generated from boronic acid derivatives using silver. 447x447px = C(sp3)‚ÄîH fluorination = One major advantage of radical fluorination is that it allows the direct fluorination of remote C‚ÄîH bonds. Metal catalysts such as Mn, Cu or W have been used to promote the reaction. Metal-free C(sp3)‚ÄîH fluorinations rely on the use of radical initiators (Et3B, persulfates or N-oxyl radicals) or organic photocatalysts. Some methods have also been developed to selectively fluorinate benzylic C‚ÄîH bonds. = C‚ÄîC bonds activation = Cyclobutanols and cyclopropanols have been used as radical precursors for the synthesis of Œ≤- or Œ≥-fluoroketones. The strained rings undergo C‚ÄîC bond cleavage in presence of a silver or an iron catalyst or when exposed to UV-light in presence of a photosensitizer. 617x617px Potential application One potential application of radical fluorination is for efficiently accessing novel moieties to serve as building blocks in medicinal chemistry. Derivatives of propellane with reactive functional groups, such as the hydrochloride salt of 3-fluorobicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-amine, are accessible by this approach.

The western side of the square consists of a four-store terraced houses that go along the Dra≈°koviƒáeva street. At the corner of the Juri≈°iƒáeva street is 1929 residential-office-commercial building (work by modernist architect Bela Auer), and next to it is a 1931 building (work by architect Paul Deutsch). On the north side of the square on the corner of Dra≈°koviƒáeva street is a 1928 commercial and residential building Janekoviƒá (work by architect Hugo Ehrlich). Next to it is a series of buildings that continue to Martiƒáeva street. In 1995, square was decorated with two large triangular fountains in front of the building of the Croatian National Bank and the State Office for Croats Abroad (work of architect Mihajlo Kranjc).

Early life Alhaji Yahaya was born in 1907 in Ilorin, Kwara State, the oldest son of Abdulkadir Popoola Ayinla-Agbe wealthy Ilorin trader and Salimotu Asabi. He started early education at the Koranic school in the Ago Market area in Ilorin and then Ilorin Provincial primary School. Being top of his class, he was selected to proceed to Katsina Training College, which later became Barewa College, for further education in June 1922. Among his contemporaries at Katsina College were Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, Aliyu Makama Bida, Suleiman Barau and Sir Kashim Ibrahim. A brilliant student and sportsman, Yahaya became Head Boy and football captain and was selected to give the welcome address to the then Governor of Nigeria, Sir Hugh Clifford, during the official commissioning of the College in 1924. Scoring the highest grades in his set, setting records that remained unbroken for many years, Yahaya was subsequently retained in the College as a teacher after his course in 1928. He taught at Katsina College for two years and his students included Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, who later became Prime Minister, Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, Justice Mohammed Bello who later became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, Justice Saidu Kawu, a former Chief Judge of Kwara State and later a Supreme Court Judge, Justice Mamman Nasir, Ibrahim Coomassie, who later became the Inspector General of the Nigerian Police, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki who later became the 18th Sultan of the Sokoto Caliphate as well as his son-in-law, Habba Habib of Borno, Shuaibu Abuja, the Sarkin Gobir of Kaligo, who later became the Emir of Gwandu, Alhaji Zulkarnaini Gambari and Alhaji Aliyu Abdulkadir aka Baba Agba, both of whom later became the 9th and 10th Emirs of Ilorin respectively. Yahaya went on to become Headmaster of Ilorin Middle School and a prominent community leader, famously settling several disputes both among prominent leaders of the community and with the British colonial authorities, for which he was awarded the Coronation Medal of King George VI in 1936. Political career Yahaya became Chairman of the Ilorin Emirate Council in 1936, where he acquired the nickname ‚ÄúYahaya Kiigbaa‚Äù (‚ÄúYahaya doesn't accept‚Äù) for his probity and staunch efforts to eliminate corruption in the Council. In 1948, along with Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Yahaya was a member of the delegation to the first African conference in London and was received at Buckingham Palace by King George VI on 8 October 1948. On his return from England, he was nominated as a member of the newly constituted Northern Regional House of Assembly and member of the Ilorin Native Authority Council. Following the coming into effect of the McPherson Constitution in 1952, Yahaya was elected as one of five members of the Northern Regional House of Assembly to join the central government legislature. That same year he became Minister for Health, joining a cabinet with Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and other prominent Northern Ministers. He was replaced in 1956 by Alhaji Ahman. During his tenure as Minister of Health he recorded many achievements, including the commissioning of several hospitals, such as the medical school in Zaria and an orthopedic hospital in Kano, and was responsible for the abolition of hospital charges in all General Hospitals in the North. In 1973, Yahaya was appointed State Commissioner of Works, during which time he signed the Asa Dam contract and commissioned several major projects. In 1981, President Shehu Shagari appointed Yahaya as one of the Committee of Elders. Pollitically, he had several dealings with the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Chief J.S Olawoyin, Chief S.B Awoniyi, Chief Gabriel Igbinedion and a host of other prominent politicians across the nation. Honours and appointments In 1936, Yahaya was awarded the Coronation Medal of King George VI. In the 1955 New Year Honours, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II and the traditional emirate title of Madawaki of Ilorin. In 1981, Yahaya was conferred by President Shehu Shagari with the national honor of Member of the Federal Republic (M.F.R.). In 1982, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters (DLL) from the University of Ilorin and the title of Atunuse of Erin-Ile. He was a member and Chairman of numerous Boards, including the northern Nigeria Development Board, Nigeria Railway Corporation, Kwara State Water Corporation and Bacita Sugar Company. He is also particularly recognized as the person who gave Kwara State its name. Business Career Alhaji Yahaya also ventured into many successful businesses, prominent among which is Yahaya Marines & Co, a shipping and logistics company that was then located at the Apapa Wharf as well as real estate among which is the popular Madawaki Estates located along Ibrahim Taiwo Road, Ilorin.

He was one of only a small number of British soldiers to survive the disastrous 1842 retreat from Kabul, in which a British army column of 4,500 men and 12,000 civilians was massacred by Afghan tribesmen as it attempted to march to Jalalabad. He was widely disliked as a tyrannical and ineffective commander whose failures led to the annihilation of his regiment and whose accidental death was cheered by his men, but he also had a deserved reputation for great physical bravery. Early career Shelton was commissioned into the army as an ensign in the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot on 21 November 1805. Two years later he became a lieutenant. In 1808 he saw action at the battles of Roli√ßa, Vimiero and Corunna in Portugal. The regiment was subsequently recalled to Britain. Shelton took part in the disastrous Walcheren expedition of 1809 before returning to the Iberian Peninsula in 1812‚Äì13. During those years he participated in the battles of Badajoz, Burgos, Salamanca and Vittoria before being severely wounded at the siege of San Sebasti√°n, losing his right arm. It was said that he stood unmoved outside his tent while a surgeon amputated the limb. In 1817 Shelton transferred to the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot and was posted to India in 1822. The regiment fought at Arakan in Burma in March 1824 during the First Anglo-Burmese War, in which Shelton displayed conspicuous courage. A year later, on 6 February 1825, he became regimental major and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 16 September 1827. He acquired a reputation as a harsh and imperious commander over the next 13 years in India with the regiment. Service in Afghanistan In late 1840 Shelton was temporarily promoted to the local rank of major general when his regiment was combined with two Indian units to create a relief for the British force in Afghanistan. During the first half of 1841 the brigade went first to Jalalabad before mounting a punitive expedition into the Nazian valley, opening the Khyber Pass to enable Shuja Shah Durrani's family to cross into India, and finally reached Kabul on 9 June. Shelton soon made himself deeply unpopular with his colleagues and subordinates, only grudgingly attending meetings with the British commander in Afghanistan, Sir William Elphinstone, rarely replying to Elphinstone's queries and generally being disagreeable towards all comers. Elphinstone later wrote that Shelton's manner was \\"most contumacious from the day of his arrival. He never gave me information or advice, but invariably found fault with all that was done and canvassed and condemned all orders before officers ‚Äì frequently perverting and delaying carrying them into effect. He appeared to be actuated by an ill-feeling towards me.\\" He treated his men harshly and was seen as \\"a tyrant to his regiment\\". Captain Colin Mackenzie observed Shelton's passage through Afghanistan and wrote that he was \\"a wretched brigadier. The monstrous confusion which takes place in crossing the rivers from his want of common arrangement is disgraceful, and would be fatal in an avowed enemy's country.\\" When Mackenzie saw the brigade on a later occasion after its return from the Khyber Pass, he wrote, \\"As I expected, Shelton has marched the brigade off its legs ... The artillery horses are quite done up, those of the cavalry nearly so, and the beasts of burden, camels etc ... have died in great numbers, and will continue to die from over-work. The unnecessary hardship he has exposed the men to, especially during their passage through the Khyber, has caused much discontent. Part of the horse artillery on one occasion actually mutinied.\\"Dalrymple, p. 257 =Uprising in Kabul= The Bala Hissar, Kabul, pictured in 1879 On 2 November 1841 an uprising broke out in Kabul which claimed the lives of the senior British officer Sir Alexander Burnes and his aides. Shelton was encamped two miles east of the city. He was ordered to occupy Kabul's citadel, the Bala Hissar, but displayed abject confusion on receiving the order. Captain George Lawrence wrote: \\"Brigadier Shelton's conduct at this crisis astonished me beyond expression ... [he] seemed almost beside himself, not knowing how to act, and with incapacity stamped on every feature of his face.\\" Despite Shelton's misgivings, his troops reached the Bala Hissar unopposed and spent the next week there. Despite the strong fortifications of the citadel, he came to believe that he could not withstand a siege there and proposed that the British force should withdraw to Jalalabad, abandoning Kabul and the pro-British Shah Shuja. Shelton's force evacuated the citadel and moved into a cantonment outside the city, though as he recognised, it was poorly fortified with a \\"rampart and ditch an Afghan could run over with the facility of a cat.\\" He failed to take any action to defend another fort containing the British garrison's food supplies, despite having 5,000 men who could have been used for the task. The Kashmiri Mohan Lal, who had been Burnes's munshi or secretary, wrote later that Shelton \\"appeared from the commencement to despair of success, which produced a baneful effect in every fighting man.\\"Dalrymple, p. 318 The commissariat fort was duly lost and on 10 November Shelton led an attack on another fort, the Rikab Bashee, which the insurgents had also occupied. It took two rallies and cost over a hundred casualties before the 44th Foot took the fort. After the Afghans placed two artillery pieces on the Bimaru Hills half a mile north of the cantonment, Shelton led an attack to drive them out. It was initially successful but the hills were soon reoccupied. =Battle of the Bimaru Hills= Ten days later Shelton took his men out again to retake the hills. This second attack proved disastrous; the Afghans' long-barrelled jezails had a longer range than the British Brown Bess muskets and Shelton made no attempt to entrench his men to protect them from enemy fire. Instead he had the troops stand for hours in rows on the brow of the hill, fully exposed to enemy fire. They were systematically gunned down by Afghan snipers while Shelton refused to retreat.Dalrymple, p. 332 To make matters worse, Shelton adopted a formation that was wholly unsuited to the situation, as Lieutenant Vincent Eyre recalled: Captain Colin Mackenzie, who took a bullet in the shoulder during the battle, wrote: The battle turned, inevitably, into a rout. 300 of the 1,100 men on the hill were killed there while many more were cut off and killed one by one during the retreat to the cantonment. George St. Patrick Lawrence, who had watched helplessly from his post in the cantonment during the battle, wrote of his horror at witnessing how \\"our flying troops [were] hotly pursued and mixed up with the enemy, who were slaughtering them on all sides: the scene was so fearful that I can never forget it.\\"Dalrymple, p. 334 He was bitterly critical of \\"the total incapacity of Brigadier Shelton, his reckless exposure of his men for hours at the top of a high ridge to a destructive fire, and his stubborn neglect to avail himself of the several opportunities offered to him throughout the day\\" which, in Lawrence's view, showed him to be \\"incapable to command.\\" =Retreat and massacre= An 1898 depiction of the last stand of survivors of the 44th Foot at Gandamak Shelton himself escaped the slaughter of his troops, though he sustained five wounds in the battle. His failure at Bimaru had a disastrous effect on morale. Mackenzie wrote that his incapacity \\"neutralised the heroism of the officers. Their spirit was gone and discipline had almost disappeared.\\" No further attempt was taken to drive back the Afghans. Shelton, who was promoted to full colonel following the battle, advocated that a retreat to Jalalabad should commence before the winter snowfall came. Elphinstone, however, prevaricated for nearly a month before attempting to begin negotiations with the Afghan side. The British emissary, Sir William Hay Macnaghten, was killed two weeks into the negotiations and on 6 January the retreat got underway. Thousands died over the following five days as the slow-moving British column was repeatedly ambushed by the Afghans. By 11 January, 12,000 of the 16,500-strong column had become casualties and only 200 troops remained as the survivors entered the small village of Jagadalak. Shelton was among them, fighting vigorously despite only having one arm. Captain Hugh Johnson wrote: \\"Nothing could exceed the bravery of Shelton. He was like a bulldog assaulted on all sides by a lot of curs trying to snap at his head, tail and sides. Shelton's small band was attacked by horse and foot, and although the latter were fifty to one, not a man dared to come close ... We cheered him in true English fashion as he descended into the valley, notwithstanding we, at the time, were acting as targets for the marksmen of the enemy on the hills.\\"Dalrymple, p. 380 Johnson accompanied Shelton and Elphinstone to a negotiation with the Afghan leader, Wazir Akbar Khan, but all three men were taken prisoner. A furious Shelton demanded that he should be allowed to return to his men and die fighting, but was refused. The remainder of the column was left to fend for itself but was massacred at Gandamak. Only one badly wounded European, Assistant Surgeon William Brydon, and a few Indian sepoys managed to reach Jalalabad on 13 January.Dalrymple, p. 386 Aftermath Shelton was one of 32 British officers and a larger number of captured soldiers, women and children who were detained by Akbar Khan for several months after the battle. Although the captives were treated considerately, Shelton appears to have taken his captivity poorly. He soon came to be detested by his fellow captives for his quarrelsome nature and Captain Souter, one of his regiment's officers, wrote in a letter home: \\"We all wear Affghan dresses of one sort or another, except Shelton, who has not adopted them; he looks the picture of misery, with a great big grey beard and mustaches; he meets with little courtesy, every one thinking himself on an equality with the other.\\" Elphinstone died in captivity, leaving Shelton as the highest-ranking British survivor. The captives were freed on 21 September but Shelton was placed under arrest by Lord Ellenborough, the Governor-General of India. He was court-martialled at Ludhiana on 31 January 1842, charged with four counts. The first stated that he had \\"prematurely, and without authority\\" ordered ammunition wagons to be emptied and filled instead with provisions for the retreat from Kabul, without Elphinstone's authorisation. The other three, less serious, charges were that he had used disrespectful language about Elphinstone in front of the troops, that he had procured fodder for his horses from Akbar Khan and that he had allowed himself to be taken prisoner at Jagdalak. Despite Shelton's obvious failures he was acquitted of three out of the four charges. He was convicted on the least serious of the four, that of having illicitly procuring food for his horses, but escaped punishment as the court considered that he had been adequately censured at the time by \\"competent authority\\", i.e. Elphinstone. Although the court opined that Shelton had given proof \\"of very considerable exertion in his arduous position, of personal gallantry of the highest kind, and of noble devotion as a soldier\\", he was roundly condemned by some of his fellow officers. General Charles Napier annotated his copy of The Military Operations at Cabul by Lieutenant Vincent Eyre with scathing comments about Shelton, of whom Napier wrote: \\"It seems to me that to Shelton may be traced the whole misfortune of this Army.\\" He described Shelton as \\"unfit to command\\" and thought that he should have been shot as \\"the author of all ill\\". Death and burial Shelton resumed his command of the 44th Foot, which had to be raised afresh as it had been virtually wiped out during the retreat. He was no more popular with his new troops than he had been before. On 10 May 1845, when his regiment was quartered in Dublin's Richmond Barracks, his horse bolted while he was riding it and he sustained severe injuries, dying three days later. When his men heard of his death they assembled on the parade ground to give three cheers. He received no medals or decorations for his many campaigns. The burial took place at St Peter's Church in Dublin, which was demolished in 1983. The text of his memorial tablet was taken largely from the 1845 edition of Hart's Annual Army List and read: References Category:1790s births Category:1845 deaths Category:44th Regiment of Foot officers Category:British Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:People of the First Anglo-Afghan War Category:British military personnel of the First Anglo-Afghan War Category:British prisoners of war ","title":"John Shelton (British Army officer)"},{"id":"48293787","text":"The Marstrand Free Port was a largely autonomous island territory of Sweden, during the Gustavian Era of the late 18th century, which effectively functioned as a merchant republic. As a free port designed with inspiration from the Italian porto Franco and declared in 1775 by King Gustav III, it became an urban centre of commerce both legal and illegal, refuge of political and religious dissidents, and hideout of wanted criminals. An experiment in free trade principles, as opposed to the mercantilist state policy of the era, the Marstrand Free Port was an economic success ‚Äì although most of the income went into private hands, rather than the state's. Despite this, its autonomous status was still revoked in 1794 after nearly two decades, following complaints from its burghers. History =Background= Danish battle map of Marstrand, 1719 Marstrand, a medieval-origin island-based town in the formerly Norwegian Bohusl√§n province, became Swedish with the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. The same year, the mighty Carlsten Fortress was constructed, a penal fortification that came to dominate the port. In the mid-18th century, the most immense of the region's centennial \\"herring periods\\" ‚Äì a seasonal surge of Atlantic herring in near-limitless amounts ‚Äì brought on a boom in Marstrand's economy. It became a primary site of commerce for the massive herring industry, which for some time provided Sweden's second largest export (after the iron industry). The idea of a free port in Marstrand had long roots. With a history of state-sanctioned privateering, Marstrand became a prospective site for a pirate haven in the early 18th century. King Charles XII, who spent most of his time in power waging the Great Northern War with all neighbouring states, received an offer from pirates sailing off Madagascar to resettle some them in Sweden in return for compensation, their ships joining the Royal Navy, with those remaining behind forming a Swedish colony. While little came of this, the proposed project set the stage for further experimental ideas in Marstrand. The very first proposal for a Swedish free port (\\"porto franco\\", based on the original Italian model, later developed throughout Western Europe) came in 1712, likewise during the reign of Charles XII, in regards to Slite (on the Baltic Sea coast of the island Gotland). In 1747, amid the parliamentary chaos of the Age of Liberty when the rivalling Hats and Caps battled for supremacy in the Riksdag, some of the burghers of Marstrand made their own first proposal, asking that their town be given free port privileges. In the process leading up to this, the burghers had attempted to build support for their idea, for example trying to persuade of the famous naturalist Carl Linnaeus (a noted proponent of autarky), at the time travelling through the area, to lobby for their cause. Among the supporters of the proposal were many leading figures of the Swedish East India Company, such the Arvidsson merchants (who had investments in Marstrand) and Pon Quyqua, a Qing Dynasty mandarin living in Gothenburg as an advisor of the East India Company. Following the failure of this, further proposals came in 1762 and 1771, both times proposing the joint free port status of Marstrand, the previously mentioned Slite, and Visby (the capital of Gotland, and during the medieval period a Baltic merchant republic). In 1775 the plan finally bore fruit, in part due to the efforts of King Louis XV in previous years towards influencing the young Crown Prince Gustav in favour of the idea, as it was beneficial to France's economic interests. In 1772, with French backing, the newly crowned Gustav III launched the Revolution of 1772, a bloodless coup d'√©tat that overthrew the Riksdag and established the rule of would-be enlightened absolutism. =Porto Franco= On 15 August 1775, Gustav III ‚Äì writing from Ekolsund Castle ‚Äì announced the charter of the Marstrand Free Port. The document was countersigned by Johan Liljencrantz (sv), the King's Minister of Finance and a proponent of anti-mercantilist reform, who in 1774 had supported the proposal together with King Louis XV and the Swedish East India Company's leadership. Half a year after this declaration, the College of Commerce announced the exact administrative details of the Free Port. As a result of his involvement in creating the Free Port, Gustav III became vastly popular among the members of its upper class, as evident in the spectactular celebration of his son (the later Gustav IV Adolf) in 1778. When visiting Marstrand in 1784, the autocratic king ‚Äì who faced significant political resistance from many in Sweden ‚Äì was warmly welcomed by Colonel M√ºller (Commandant of Carlsten Fortress), Mayor Ekstr√∂m, the Council of Burghers, and many wealthy merchants. In 1784, as a consequence of commercial agreements with France, Gustav III gained the Caribbean island colony Saint Barth√©lemy, and engaged in the slave trade, to which the Bohusl√§n herring industry had ties as well. The island, which remained Swedish until 1878, was declared a porto Franco inspired by ‚Äì and using largely the same principles as ‚Äì the Marstrand Free Port. Trade At the core of the Marstrand Free Port laid regulations for its commerce to be \\"free and unrestricted\\", completely free of taxation and tolls, while all goods leaving the port for the mainland had to go through the same high tolls as all foreign imports in Sweden, practically making Marstrand foreign territory from an economic point of view. To defend the town's borders and restrict illegal commerce, extensive measures were taken. The harbours were sealed off and watched by toll inspectors at two separate stations, watchmen were on post at two outlying islands to crack down on smuggling, soldiers from Carlsten Fortress were on patrol across the island, a special patrol boat constantly searched the nearby straits, and the main inland road had guardsmen posted. No one could enter the Free Port without proper identification and entry papers. The taxation-free shipping to Marstrand brought in many foreign ships, from all over the continent. French, Spanish and British ships all converged there, side-by-side with large East Indiamen. During the late 1770s, the trade was so extensive the town wharf had to be significantly expanded. During the American Revolutionary War, dozens of American cargo ships docked there, and the trans-Atlantic trade became incredibly profitable due to Sweden's neutral but friendly relations in regards to the nascent United States. Combined with the massive herring industry, this made Marstrand's burghers very wealthy. In addition to the free exchange of goods, a freedom of profession was likewise introduced. Within the Free Port, the old system of mandatory guild membership was abolished, meaning that each inhabitant could ply whatever trade they wished without restriction. There was likewise no market regulations in regards to pricing. No taxation existed, with the exception of certain fees on food and drink. Government Marstrand remained a Swedish town, governed by Swedish law, but had almost complete local autonomy, and was ruled by a Council of Burghers (Swedish: Borgarr√•d) influenced by the republican standing of the Italian porto francos and chaired by a mayor. The Council was soon appointed by the inhabitants through elections, and it ‚Äì in the role as the \\"town elders\\" ‚Äì had the right to decide all ongoing affairs. It had twenty-four members, of which six were up for yearly re-elections. Eighteen of the Councillors had to be native Sweden, the rest could be foreigners on the condition that they possessed property worth at least 1,000 riksdaler and had resided in Marstrand for two years or more. Judicial matters in the Marstrand Free Port were overseen by a set of Magistrates, while order was maintained by the Commandant of Carlsten Fortress, who held the title of Governor-General in the colonial fashion. The Magistrates, tasked with ensuring Swedish law was followed, had no power to decide any measures without the cooperation of the Council of Burghers, and in more important matters the decisions had to be reviewed by Marstrand's inhabitants. Society Fort Fredriksborg at Carlsten Fortress was the site of Sweden's first synagogue. Due to its status as a porto Franco, Marstrand's population boomed, going from around 700 during the 1760s to about 1,700 people in 1788, 50% were immigrants. In addition to this, there was a large migratory population. While most were from the rest of Bohusl√§n, nearby Gothenburg or the capital Stockholm, every Swedish county was represented, with a significant foreign minority. Immigration from both Sweden and all over Europe was encouraged, to bring in financial capital ‚Äì if a person brought property in Marstrand, and resided there for two years, they received citizenship. Overall, most people only stayed in Marstrand for a few years, and few brought their families. In the words of an anonymous poet, every language and dialect could be heard in the Free Port. As part of the charter mandated by Gustav III, complete religious freedom ‚Äì rare in a non- secular country dominated by the strict Church of Sweden ‚Äì was given to Marstrand's inhabitants, following discussions between Gustav III and Louis XV. This caused numerous Jews to migrate there, benefiting from the lack of trade restrictions and the ability to freely practice Judaism. Initially these were mainly wealthy merchants, who worked together with the Swedish East India Company. Later, Jewish craftsmen and more lowly traders also came. The first Jewish people in Marstrand were Moses Salomon and Elias Magnus, who settled there in 1779. In the early 1780s numerous Jews came from Hamburg, which prompted the construction of a synagogue ‚Äì the very first in Sweden. After permission was granted by Gustav III, part of Carlsten Fortress was rented out to the newly formed Jewish congregation for religious purposes. Later on, another building within the town itself was used. As they had no rabbi, the congregation was led by a hazzan (cantor). It consisted of about 60 people living in Marstrand permanently, the temporary population passing over a hundred. Following the end of the Free Port in 1794, almost all Jews in the town moved to Gothenburg, forming the core of the modern congregation there. Many political refugees also came to Marstrand, especially hailing from the French Revolution, the outbreak of which in 1789 (and subsequent events) caused a large community of expatriate Frenchmen, both exiled aristocrats and dissident republicans, to form abroad. Gustav III, deeply connected to the French royal family and heavily invested in the counter-revolutionary cause, no doubt welcomed them. Many had wealth, and brought it with them. Some stayed in Sweden permanently, others lived incognito under assumed names and either returned home again or left for other destinations. Criminals Much due to its free flow of commerce and loose rules, Marstrand became known as a stronghold of sin, especially among the clergy. There was some truth to this ‚Äì the Free Port's charter, in Gustav III's own words, stipulated that it was to be a safe haven for all manners of criminals. As long as their crime didn't concern matters of \\"honour and life\\", they were afforded full legal protection. This caused a surge of debtors and other financial criminals moving into the Free Port, often bringing with them their stolen profits. Upon arrival, these \\"refugees\\" received official certificates from the Council of Burghers, recording their transgression, and permission to reside on the island. Sometimes, employees of prominent herring trading houses would arrive in Marstrand carrying a large sum of money intended for use in local investments ‚Äì and promptly sign up for a certificate, freely walking away with the funds. Many of these arrivals were of upper-class origin, some even noblemen, and often gained prominent positions within the society of the Free Port as well. Among them were counts, military officers, royal secretaries, East India Company treasurers, court magistrates, barons, and others. The grand parties hosted by some of these men at local taverns together with the local burghers, the Commandant, and the Carlsten Fortress officers, have been recorded. But not all who came to Marstrand had such social standing ‚Äì other recorded cases included unhappy peasants seeking to escape their marriages, apprentices fleeing heavy-handed masters, youths seeking to marry against the wishes of their parents, and individuals wanted for breaking the royal alcohol monopoly by illicitly producing br√§nnvin. It wasn't before 1792, two years prior to the Free Port's demise, that the rule allowing people fleeing the legal system entry was changed. Before then, over 500 people had made use of the rule, about 10% of which were foreigners from the other Nordic countries, Germany and England. Some well-known criminals came there less willingly. Given the penal use of Carlsten Fortress, often for political prisoners, many of those convicted of participation of the 1788 Anjala conspiracy ‚Äì in which military officers plotted to force an end to the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì90), and possibly to create an independent Finland ‚Äì where interned in Marstrand. Some were deported from there to Saint Barth√©lemy, others remained on the island. The noble prisoners, numbering many dozens, were given large liberties, and were often free to wander around the heavily defended Free Port and socialize, accompanied by a single guardsman. =Decline= Marstrand and Carlsten Fortress, in the 21st century Despite said heavy defences, smuggling was rife in the Marstrand Free Port. Preventing it was however largely a futile task, with large amounts of goods trafficked from and to the Free Port, and onwards ‚Äì past the royal tolls. Another problem was piracy, when in 1789 during the Russo-Swedish War a group of Russian privateers attacking Swedish shipping on the West Coast. During Gustav III's later reign, with the Russo- Swedish War and the Theatre War (in which Dano-Norwegian troops came very close to Marstrand), Sweden was fraught with political instability. In 1792, the Free Port's royal creator and benefactor was assassinated by disgruntled noblemen, and the young Gustav IV Adolf was crowned. Despite all this, Marstrand prospered, its population steadily rising and commerce reaching new heights. At the same time, fears grew that the Free Port was being misused for personal (and above all, foreign) gain rather than royal (and local) profits, and the fight against smuggling became quite hopeless. In the end, it was the burghers of Marstrand themselves that brought the Free Port era to an end, after almost twenty years in operation. They requested a royal withdrawal of the town's rights as a porto Franco. This was granted on 15 May 1794, through a decree by Gustav IV Adolf's regency government. Marstrand's decline was fast. The population had decreased substantially already within a year, the Jewish congregation had left, and much of the international investment ceased. As the herring period continued for about a decade more, Marstrand's primary industry remained, and the burghers still prospered for some time. By 1808 the herring was gone, and the glory days were gone with it. Fifteen years later much of the wooden town was destroyed in a fire, marking the final end. Today, Marstrand is largely a tourist town, with a population of about 1,300 people.

That same year, he was elected to Seat#9 at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, which he held until his death. =Paintings= La Charge There are nine of his works in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, including his most famous painting, La Charge. This dramatic street scene, painted c.1902, shows a violent confrontation between police and demonstrators on the Boulevard Montmartre, viewed from a high angle. This plunging perspective was one of Devambez‚Äô artistic trademarks, as was the production of paintings on wood in small formats, works known as \\"les Tout- Petits\\". . As an artist Devambez was attracted to scenes of modern life, and in 1910, being invited to provide decorative panels for the new French Embassy in Vienna, he chose the subject of modern inventions, painting the metro, an omnibus, airships and aeroplanes. Sadly these designs have not survived, but an oil painted the same year, now in the Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, gives an idea of how they must have looked. Entitled Le seul oiseau qui vole au-dessus des nuages (The only bird that flies above the clouds), it employs another breathtaking downward perspective to show a biplane flying above a cloud-mass, with glimpses of the ground far below. In 1934 Andr√© Devambez was appointed official artist to the newly created French Air Ministry. Le seul oiseau qui vole au dessus des nuages Growing up as he did in a printing shop, it was inevitable that Andr√© Devambez would also take up printmaking. He produced a considerable number of etchings, including an album of Douze Eaux-fortes, issued in an edition of 150 copies in 1915. The twelve etchings in this rare album are of First World War subjects, with the following titles: Le Froid; Les Trous d'obus; Le Bouclier; L'Incendie; Un Schraprell; La Pluie; L'Espionne; Les Otages; Gare la Marmite; Les R√©serves; Le Charbon; Le Fou. Devambez was also a lithographer. =Illustrations= Andr√© Devambez also wrote and illustrated books. Auguste a Mauvais Caract√®re (Devambez, 1913) was a children's book, with Andr√©'s own illustrations hand-coloured by the master of stencil technique, Jean Saud√©; the original illustrations were exhibited the following year at the Palais de Glace. This was the first of a number of children's books, including Histoire de la petite Tata et du Gros Patapouf and Les Aventures du Capitaine Mille-Sabords, nos. 8 and 9 in a series of undated stories issued in concertina format \\"Chez l‚Äôauteur\\". These children's stories were probably intended for the amusement of his son, the archaeologist and curator of Greek and Roman antiquities at the Louvre, Pierre Devambez (1902‚Äì1980) and his daughter Valentine (1907-?). Books illustrated by Andr√© Devambez include La F√™te √† Coqueville by √âmile Zola (, 1899); Le Poilu a Gagn√© la Guerre by Charles Le Goffic (1919); and Les Condamn√©s √† Mort by Claude Farr√®re (√âdouard-Joseph & L‚ÄôIllustration, 1920). He also contributed illustrations to Le Figaro Illustr√©, Le Rire, and L'Illustration. A retrospective of his work was held at the Mus√©e de Beauvais in 1988.

The NCSF board for certification oversees the National Commission for Certifying Agencies accredited credentialing programs and advocates on behalf of exercise professionals. In 2004, the NCSF organization expanded internationally, offering exercise professional credentialing worldwide. In partnership with Prometric Testing Services the organization provides accredited certification exams in over 10,000 centers within its global network. Professional credentials The NCSF Board for Certification provides credentials for exercise professionals. Based on role delineation studies, and consistent with the Department of Labor Statistics for fitness trainers and athletic coaches, the board currently offers three credentials ‚Äì Certified Personal Trainer, Certified Strength Coach, and Sports Nutrition Specialist. In order to improve obesity/diabetes in the United States the organization has submitted testimonial recommendations for adjustments to the Standard Occupational Classification (2018) aimed to reclassify exercise professionals as health providers rather than service providers. History The NCSF was founded in 1996 as an expansion from a community outreach initiative, which began in 1994 at Florida International University. The goal was to improve exercise professional competency in order to promote and enhance community education in health and physical fitness in South Florida. The professional education program was employed for two years before a formal oversight board was established. In 1996 the organization was incorporated and a seven-person board was established as the governing body, chaired by Dr. Richard Lopez, retired program director for the department of exercise physiology, Florida International University. Dr. Lopez received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the NCSF Board for Certification in 2012 for his commitment to the field. In 2001, the board contracted, then, Thompson Prometric, for test development services in an effort to establish minimum competency requirements for exercise professionals serving as Personal Trainers. This came at an opportune time as the International Health, Racquet, and Sportsclub Association board released an (original) recommendation for member clubs and operators within the fitness industry to employee NCCA accredited exercise professionals for positions that oversee fitness instruction of club members. The NCSF joined the National Strength and Conditioning Association and the American Council on Exercise. Since 2004 several other organizations including the American College of Sports Medicine have earned accreditation from the National Commission for Certifying Agencies for exercise professional roles. Advocacy In an effort to foster strong, evidence-based curriculum for developing practitioners in the health-fitness fields, the NCSF serves on the Committee on Accreditation for the Exercise Sciences as a sponsoring organization. The committee functions under the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs to evaluate undergraduate and graduate academic programs in Exercise Science against established standards and guidelines to promote preparation for students entering the health and fitness industry. In 2013, the NCSF, along with other similar organizations, formed a non-profit 501(c) corporation in support of a uniform standard of minimum competency assurance and professional practices for defined exercise professional roles. The Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals advocates for exercise professionals who have earned an National Commission for Certifying Agencies-accredited health and fitness professional certification. In 2014 the Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals established the United States Registry of Exercise Professionals. This registry is populated with exercise professionals from Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals member organizations who hold certifications from the National Commission for Certifying Agencies. The registry operates as a clearing house of valid credentials so consumers, employers, and regulators can identify and verify professionals currently certified by member organizations. NCSF also serves the international community by participating in EuropeActive, formerly the European Health and Fitness Association, annual Standards Council meeting. This meeting functions as a think tank among subject matter experts from Europe and the United States who converge to review and discuss research and its impact on exercise professions and public physical activity engagement. Promotion of physical activity engagement In 2012 the NCSF joined the National Coalition for the Promotion of Physical Activity. The organization is made up of a steering committee of sponsoring organizations including the American Heart Association, National Athletic Trainers Association, the Mend Foundation, International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, the American Council on Exercise, the American College of Sports Medicine, and Shape America among others, which oversee operations and management of the organization‚Äôs public policy activities. Current physical activity legislation * Carol M. White Physical Education Program * NIH Common Fund * Fitness Integrated in Teaching (FIT) Kids Act * Prevention and Public Health Fund * Transportation Alternatives Program Improvement Act Employee wellness is an area in which the National Coalition for the Promotion of Physical Activity has been particularly active. The coalition sponsors the CEO pledge, a national campaign focused on promoting physical activity in the workplace. The CEO Pledge encourage CEOs from across the United States to recognize and support physical activity for employee wellbeing. NCSF Executive Director Dr. Brian Biagioli was one of the inaugural signors of the pledge.

A native of Tirana, he lived and worked from the end of 18th century until mid 19th century. Together with Hasan Zyko Kamberi and Nezim Frakulla he was part of the Bejtexhinj who focused on social and political criticism rather than Islamic moral and life. A precursor of the bourgeois critical-realism, he is also considered one of the first anti-feudal writers in Albania. Life Zenel was born in Tirana, back then Sanjak of Scutari of Ottoman Empire, in late 18th century, and is mentioned to have lived in the era of Ali Pasha Tepelena. It is believed that the year of birth is 1765‚Äì70. He was the son of Ram√´ Hyka, a villager from nearby Bastar who had settled in Tirane (thus the family name Bastari) and a local woman. He had a brother named Rexhep. Zenel took his first lessons in the mejtep (religious school) in Tirana. He later entered the Madrasa of Tirana. Meanwhile, he worked as an assistant in a local esnaf shop dealing with silk and embroidering, therefore he mastered that profession (Albanian: gajtanxhi). After finishing the madrasa, he worked as a hodja for the rest of his life. There is no information on his religious teachers or people who influenced him, but from his work is derived that he was very well prepared in Islamic Mysticism and he was a follower of the Bektashi order of Sufism. Year of death is accepted to be between 1835‚Äì1840. He mentions in his poetry Baba Shemin, an actual public and Bektashi religious figure from Fushe-Kruje who died in 1831. Work =Studies on his work= As no original written collection has survived all the poems have reached today as oral tradition or scattered in pieces in mosques and tekkes. His work, collected in a diwan was presented only in the 1930s. The first to draw interest on his work was Ibrahim Hasanaj, who collected the poems from Hafiz Ibrahim Dalliu, Rexhep Nizami, Ali Bixhiu and Hamid Ohri, and in 1959 sent to the Literature-Linguists Catedre of the University of Tirana all the written materials he found on Bastari. The bejtes of Bastari spread a lot and got popularity due to their strong social- political messages. Albanian scholar Jorgo Bulo states that \\"If [Bastari's work] came in oral tradition to date, this shows its vitality\\". The researcher Arif Gjyli used Hasanaj's findings to come up with a long critical study and interpretation of Bastari's work in 1961. It was published in the Bulletini p√´r Shkencat Shoq√´rore (Bulletin for Social Studies) of the Tirana University. Another study, based on Gjyli's work, came from Mahmut Hysa, published in the Gjurmime Albanologjike (Albanological Reconnaissance) magazine of the Albanological Institute of Pristina in 1988. Meanwhile, Hasanaj continued the task of collecting Bastari's poems until 1970, and added 145 odes, finally bringing the diwan to the structural and content level as known today. The full diwan was published only in 2003 with the support of the Bektashi community of Albania, and its leader Haxhi Dede Reshat Bardhi. Bastari wrote ghazals, qasidas, and odes. He used many Oriental words like all the Albanian writers of that era, but applied carefully all poetical rules of that time, and enriched the language with \\"mystical\\" terminology thus differing from the everyday language. =Social context= As a precursor of the Albanian Rilindja literature, Bastari's work is also specifically important because it went past the usual mystical-philosophical and religious context of the Oriental-style poetry of the time. It brought strong social notes which cannot be found to this extent in other works of contemporary poets. Bastari showed criticism, rage, and contempt towards the religious administration, feudal rules, landowners, hodjas, pashas, judicial system personnel (kadis) for their corruption, abuse of power, and their indifference and maltreatment on the masses. Bastari lived in Tirana in a period of violent social injustices, which were quite common in the Ottoman Empire of that time and especially in Ottoman Albania. Worried about the fate of simple people, and educated with the notion of justice, he couldn't help but to raise his voice against those negative social phenomena and all those whom he considered responsible. In many of his poems, it is noted that he used pejorative and critical tones. He found inspiration in the honest events and personages, both historical or national, local beys, but also people of low-morality, liars, and at a point, he becomes part of the antagonisms and clashes through his verses. The poet was a family friend and sided with the Jallaj family (locals of Tirana) during their conflict with the powerful Toptani family. In two of his poems dedicated to Hysen Aga Jella and Ahmed Bey Qorri, he uses polemical and strong satirical notes. This is also present in the poem dedicated to Baba Shemin, a well-known clergyman who initiated Ali Pasha Tepelena as a Bektashi, murdered by orders of Kapllan Pasha Toptani - nothing more than a local expression of the Ottoman rule arrogance. This affiliation gives his work a soundful social content, as a reflection of the transitional period of a society in strong moral crisis, where decent castes find themselves insecure and threatened. Legacy A street in Tirana is named after him.

After prolonged disagreement over its provisions, the treaty was revoked in 1956. Provisions According to the treaty, the Dutch agreed to transfer, by December 30, 1949 (transfer was made on Dec. 27, 1949), their political sovereignty over the entire territory of the former Dutch East Indies, with the exception of West New Guinea (West Irian), to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia, which was to be a federal government formed of the republican state and the 15 autonomous states created by the Dutch. This new republic together with the Netherlands established a Netherlands-Indonesian Union, which was intended to work for the common interest. In return for Dutch political concessions, the new republic gave a guarantee to Dutch investors in the region and accepted the debt of 4.3 billion guilders. The status of West New Guinea was to be settled in discussions to take place the following year. The Hague Agreement apparently benefited the Netherlands, but Indonesian nationalists were dissatisfied with certain articles in the agreement, especially those dealing with the nature of the state, the dominant role of the autonomous Dutch states, the debt, and the West New Guinea problem. The dissatisfied nationalists drafted a provisional constitution in 1950 and established Indonesia as a unitary state. The conflict between the Dutch and the Indonesian nationalists continued, and on April 21, 1956, the Indonesian parliament revoked the Hague Agreement.

She has been involved in almost every renovation project in downtown Denver, from the initial designation of the LoDo District and creation of Larimer Square to the Union Station. She was recognized by her alma mater, Radcliffe College, for the Larimer Square project, was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, and in 2013 the hotel at the restoration project of Union Station was renamed as the Crawford Hotel in honor of her contributions to preserve the history of Denver. Biography Dana Hudkins was born on July 22, 1931 in Salina, Kansas. She graduated from Monticello College and then went on to complete her undergraduate degree at the University of Kansas in 1953. From there, she enrolled in Radcliffe College and studied Business Administration, graduating in 1954. That same year, she moved to Denver, Colorado and began working in a public relations firm. In 1955, she married a geologist, John W. R. Crawford III, and they subsequently had four sons. In the early 1960s, when the Lower Downtown (LoDo) area of the 1400 block of Larimer Street was being proposed for demolition, Crawford organized a group of investors to buy the property for a potential retail redevelopment project. They formed an organization called Historic Denver, Inc. with the goal of preserving Denver's architectural heritage and save the Molly Brown House. There was strong opposition to the preservation movement from the Denver Urban Renewal Authority as well as community opposition from those who thought that designating the area as a preservation district would limit new development in the area. Finding financing was another hurdle, as many banks did not want to lend to a woman. She surmounted the problem by obtaining financing from the New York Life Insurance Company. After about 10 years of planning, in 1971, Denver's first Historic District, Larimer Square, was launched. She received a Radcliffe Alumnae Recognition Award for her successful development of Larimer Square. After completing the Larimer Square project, Crawford started work on Union Station neighborhood but worked alone for nearly 30 years. In the interim, she worked on preservation of the Oxford Hotel, LoDo's Millennium retail office project, two Flour Mill Loft redevelopment ventures, the Ice House, Coors Field, and others. In 1996, she was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame for her preservation and development of downtown Denver. The Flour Mill Loft Project, completed in 1999, was one of Crawford's personal favorites, as it was \\"the first residential project in the Platte Valley\\". In 2008, several investors got together and a plan was formed to design, finance and build a transit system linked to Union Station. The station itself was accepting proposals and Crawford put together a team, which they called the Union Station Alliance, to make a bid. They won the project in December 2011 and a 99-year lease on the station and set about obtaining approval from the National Park Service to make alterations to the historic site. After a year, approval was attained, the consortium changed equity partners and the development got underway. In 2013, the hotel within Union Station, was renamed the Crawford Hotel in Crawford's honor as a way to recognize her contributions to the revitalization of downtown Denver.

From the State's main port of Port Adelaide they supplied goods to many isolated regional settlements, returning with cargoes of agricultural products (particularly wheat and wool) and minerals. They also played a role in lightering grain to load larger vessels offshore in deeper waters, the most famous example being to windjammers off Port Victoria, Spencer Gulf, which until 1949 marked the start of the Great Grain Race.
