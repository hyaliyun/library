Hieta, also known by the pseudonym Nordic or Nordic the Incurable, is a Finn connected with the role playing and computer game culture.

Hieta published his first Finnish language role playing game, Miekka ja magia, in 1987. Other games by Hieta include Elhendi and Astra. He has made the largest number of games produced by Arctic ranger productions. Hieta has said that he originally found role playing games via a computer game set in the Dungeons & Dragons world. According to Nordic, his designation \\"the incurable\\" refers to his feelings about dragons. Hieta works in a Fantasiapelit shop in Tampere. Hieta became famous by the name \\"Nordic\\" as the writer of the \\"Peliluola\\" (\\"The Gaming Den\\") column in MikroBitti.Peliluola Ricostar.net. Hieta had originally contacted the magazine claiming to write better reviews than the magazine had at the time. The contact led to him becoming an assistant in the magazine. Nordic had a very personal touch in his column, and he often wrote very freely about his own and his friends' activities with computer and role playing games. \\"Peliluola\\" published gameplay hints, viewers' high scores and short reviews. Letters sent by readers played an important part in the column. The column usually started with a story about Nordic's current adventures in his role playing games. The best known figure in the stories was Petrell, a games character created by Pete, a friend of Nordic. Nordic's long-time favourite computer game in the 1980s was Boulder Dash. The first \\"Peliluola\\" column was published in MikroBitti issue 3/1985 and the last in 1998.

Operated by the Western Golf Association, the Evans Scholars Foundation has helped more than 11,300 caddies graduate from college since its creation in 1930. The Foundation was founded with money earned and donated by famed amateur golfer Charles \\"Chick\\" Evans.  History  In 1916, Evans rose to fame by becoming the first amateur golfer to win the Western Amateur, Western Open, U.S. Amateur, and U.S. Open. As a result of those wins and other victories, Evans was given several thousand dollars in royalties for recording golf instructions for the Brunswick Record Company. In addition, he received royalties from a golf book written in 1921. If he accepted this money, he would have lost his amateur status. Evans' mother suggested he put the money to good use by sponsoring a scholarship fund for caddies. Evans himself was unable to finish his schooling at Northwestern University. Evans said his mother \\"wouldn't think of accepting my money unless we could arrange it to be trusted to furnish educations for deserving, qualified caddies.\\" He also said his mother \\"pointed out that the money came from golf and thus should go back into golf. It was all her dream ‚Äî her idea.\\" Evans went to the Western Golf Association, an organization that conducted national golf championships, to get their support for his scholarship. The WGA initially declined Evans' request, stating that it was a golf organization interested only in running championships, most notably the Western Open. In 1929, Evans successfully lobbied the WGA to manage the scholarship on his behalf with the help of his longtime friend and prominent Chicago tax attorney, Carleton Blunt. In 1930, Evans' and his mother's dream became a reality when two caddies, Harold Fink and Jim McGinnis, were named the first two recipients of the Evans Scholarship. They enrolled at Northwestern, the same university where Evans himself had once been a student. Until World War II, all Evans Scholars attended Northwestern, and, in 1940, the first Evans Scholarship House was established on the Evanston campus.  Program expansion  After Evans' initial investment in the Foundation had run out, Blunt, an avid golfer and philanthropist, agreed to continue to help raise money to send more caddies to college. The organization didn't seek outside funding until 1949, relying solely on the generosity of the Western Golf Association's Directors. To help grow the program as Blunt raised additional funds for scholarship, the Western Golf Association hired Roland F. ‚ÄúMac‚Äù McGuigan, Dean of Men at Northwestern and Faculty Advisor to the Northwestern Chapter of Evans Scholars, in 1949 to serve as its Educational Director. Following World War II, the program grew dramatically. In 1950, the Foundation sent just 84 caddies to college. By the end of the decade, the number of Scholars enrolled in college increased to 440 and a number of other Scholarship Houses had been established across the country. As the number of scholarships grew so did the organization's presence on a number of college campus, mainly those in the Midwest. In total, there are 17 Scholarship Houses. In order of their founding, Evans Scholarship Houses can be found at: Northwestern, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Michigan State University, Marquette University, University of Minnesota, Ohio State University, Purdue University, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Missouri, Indiana University Bloomington, Miami University, University of Oregon, University of Kansas, University of Washington and Penn State University. In 2013, The Evans Scholars Foundation sent Scholars to the University of Notre Dame. Their enrollment marked the first time the program has sent its caddies to the private university in South Bend, Indiana in nearly 50 years. There are now 1,045 Scholars at 19 universities across the nation. Since its founding, the Evans Scholars Foundation has invested more than $435 million in the college educations of more than 11,300 Alumni.  Scholarship selection  To qualify for an Evans Scholarship, a caddie must meet four key requirements. Candidates must have at least two years of outstanding caddying service. Candidates must have an excellent high school academic record, including high standardized test scores. Candidates must demonstrate significant financial need. Candidates must also receive letters of recommendation from club and high school officials attesting to the applicant's character. Candidates are personally interviewed at one of a series of Selection Meetings, co-hosted by the Western Golf Association and its affiliated country clubs.  Fundraising  Funding for the scholarships provided by the Evans Scholars Foundation comes from a variety of sources, including private donations, fundraising events and professional and amateur golf tournaments held across the country each year. Since its founding in 1950, the Western Golf Association's Par Club has been one of the most important and substantial revenue streams for the Evans Scholars Foundation. There are more than 33,000 Par Club members, many of whom belong to the more than 460 WGA member clubs across the country. In 2011, the Foundation launched its first Match Play Challenge campaign, in which a group of donors pooled together gifts of $50,000 and greater to match every gift of $2,500 and greater the Foundation received. One of the Foundation's most notable fundraising events in recent years has been the Western Golf Association's Green Coat Gala, held annually in Chicago. Golf legends Curtis Strange, Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Gary Player and Johnny Miller have all been honored at the gala. The Foundation is the benefiting charity of the BMW Championship (PGA Tour) and has received more than $35 million from the tournament since BMW became its title sponsor in 2007. In addition to those proceeds, BMW has also agreed to give the program $100,000 if a player gets a hole-in-one during championship play as Steve Stricker did in 2012 at Crooked Stick Golf Club, Hunter Mahan did during the 2013 BMW Championship at Conway Farms Golf Club, Jordan Spieth did in 2015 during the BMW Championship at Conway Farms and Jason Day did it at the 2017 BMW Championship at Conway Farms.  Awards  Charity Navigator, a nonprofit organization that evaluates other charitable organizations across America based on criteria ranging from fiscal responsibility to accountability and transparency, has consistently given the Evans Scholars Foundation a four-star rating, the highest-possible rating. In 2013, the National Scholarship Providers Association, a group whose members include the Ford Foundation, the Magic Johnson Foundation and other notable nonprofits, named the Evans Scholars Foundation as its Scholarship Provider of the Year. Notable alumni Several Evans Scholars Alumni have gone on to excel in the business world and other fields. They include CEOs Sam Allen of John Deere, Thomas Falk of Kimberly- Clark, former longtime chief of Nuveen Investments Timothy Schwertfeger, Iridium Communications CEO Matt Desch, and oil and gas magnate George Solich.. John Shubeck, NBC Newscaster Anchor in Los Angeles, won a scholarship while at the University of Michigan.

History  A self-proclaimed 'burnt-out activist' who disliked the image of the aggressive activist, but wanted to do something to change the world, Sarah Corbett was involved in activism while growing up in Liverpool and then studying at the University of Manchester. She worked for traditional charities for seven years. It was after moving to London for a job in 2007 and joining various activist groups that she started getting increasingly into her hobby of cross-stitch, finding that it helped with stress. She didn't feel like she fitted into any of the activist groups she joined in London. She had been cross-stitching as a hobby since the age of 18 and in August 2008 had the 'light bulb' idea to combine the two. Corbett set up the Lonely Craftivist blog in 2008 and began receiving comments and emails from people around the world asking to join in.

A party of 650 Polish insurgents, commanded by Dionizy Czachowski, clashed with a 500-strong detachment of the Imperial Russian Army. The clash ended in rebel victory; Russian losses were estimated at app. 50‚Äì60 killed, while Poles lost 27 killed and 30 wounded. On October 20, Czachowski and his party crossed the Vistula river, and headed northwards. News of the insurgent unit presence reached the town of Staszow, in which stationed a Russian garrison of infantry and dragoons. Russian commandant, Major Chuti, decided to set a trap for the marching insurgents, near the village of Rybnica, where the road went along the bottom of a valley. Russians took positions on the top of a hill, at the edge of a forest. Russian attack began at app. 3 p.m., when Cossacks shot at insurgent cavalry. Polish leaders managed to prevent panic among their ranks, and soon afterwards, insurgent infantry supported by kosynierzy attacked Russian soldiers. Due to Polish pressure, Cossacks had to withdraw across a river, where many drowned. The skirmish lasted for some 90 minutes, after which Russians retreated northwards. Their commandant, Major Chuti, did not give up and on the next day attacked the insurgents at Jurkowice.  Sources  *Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.

The comic focused on the conceits of popular role-playing games, which all defined \\"average\\" in different ways. He later wrote and illustrated The New Adventures of Fineous Fingers for the same magazine, under license from J.D. Webster. Holmgren is responsible for several cover illustrations for the early issues of Jolly Blackburn's popular Knights of the Dinner Table, and contributed to the design of the character Sara . His artwork has been featured in Dork Tower. Holmgren was head artist for Sheep on the Borderlands, a 2002 Origins Award nominee. In 1998, Holmgren co-founded Sanguine Productions, and a year later produced Ironclaw: Anthropomorphic Fantasy Role- Play. Despite the 2000 release of the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons and the subsequent marketplace dominance of the d20 System, the Ironclaw game found a small but solid core audience. Holmgren served as head designer and art director on later Sanguine projects, including Jadeclaw, Albedo: Platinum Catalyst, and Usagi Yojimbo.

Aadi Himani Chamunda temple as viewed against the backdrop of the Dhauladhar mountains. This is a makeshift temple after the original temple was burnt by lightning in February 2014 History The temple stands close to the ruins of the palace of Raja Chandar Bhan Chand Katoch (d. 1660),googlebooks.co.uk; Social, Cultural and Economic History of Himachal Pradesh (Manjit Singh Ahluwalla), p.26 and is of least the same age, if not far older. Until 1992 the temple was also derelict but has been restored, in very large measure as a result of the dedication and hard work of one man, Mr. P. D. Saini, a retired Class 1 officer, who worked on its restoration for 20 years after his retirement, with the assistance of a group of devotees. He continues (as of 2013) to devote himself to the improvement of the temple even after its administration was taken on by the government. The temple environs are of outstanding natural beauty and for that reason a destination for trekkers. Aadi Himani Chamunda Temple (3185 meters) is located on a hilltop North East to the existing Chamunda Devi Temple in Kangra District of Himachal Pradesh. One can reach there after hiking about 13 Kilometers from Dharamshala Palampur state Highway (Jadrangal Village) and 8.5 Kilometers from the last motor able road at Kardiana. The trek to Aadi Himani Chamunda Devi requires about 6-7 hours and moderate expertise is required. Devotees visit the sacred shrine throughout the year except winters. As per locals goddess Chamunda killed two demons Chand and Mund from the top of the mountain by throwing huge boulders on them, one can still find one of the boulder above the Shiva Temple located near existing Chamunda Devi Temple on Dharamshala Palampur state highway. The recent temple build in past decade was destroyed by the fierce fire in 2014 and now it has been under reconstruction again by the help of devotees and Temple Trust. The water is available till the half way and after that pilgrims need to carry their own. One can also find tea shops cum resting location multiple times till the hilltop temple. Dedication and worship Chamunda (Sanskrit: ‡§ö‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§æ, CƒÅmu·πá·∏çƒÅ), also known as Chamundi, Chamundeshwari and Charchika, is a fearsome aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother and one of the seven Matrikas (mother goddesses). She is also one of the chief Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses, who are attendants of the warrior goddess Durga.Wangu, p. 94 The name is a combination of Chanda and Munda, two monsters whom Chamunda killed. She is closely associated with Kali, another fierce aspect of Devi.Kinsley p. 158, Devi Mahatmya verses 10.2-5 She is sometimes identified with goddesses Parvati, Chandi or Durga as well. The goddess is often portrayed as haunting cremation grounds or fig trees. The goddess is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine and in the ancient times, human sacrifices were offered too. Originally a tribal goddess, Chamunda was assimilated in Hinduism and later entered the Jain pantheon too, although in Jainism, the rites of her worship include vegetarian offerings, and not the meat and liquor offerings. Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar says that Chamunda was originally an indigenous goddess worshipped by the Munda peoples of the Vindhya range of central India. These tribes were known to offer goddesses animal as well as human sacrifices along with ritual offerings of liquor. These methods of worship were retained in Tantric worship of Chamunda, after assimilation in Hinduism. He proposes that the fierce nature of this goddess is due of her association with Vedic Rudra (identified as Shiva in modern Hinduism), identified with fire god Agni at times.A B Moor p. 118 Wangu also backs the theory of the tribal origins of the goddess. Getting there Himani Chamunda temple is accessible via a moderately difficult trek from Jia village. The trek from Jia village is 7.4 kilometers one way. While the ascent takes 3-4 hours to complete; the descent can be completed in 2-3 hours. The route is dotted with shops, solar lights and shelters. There is no perennial water point available on this trek route or at the temple, so it is advisable to carry your own water.

The Jewish Archive (Archivo Judaico) was the name given to a collection of documents compiled by the regime of Francisco Franco in Spain during the Second World War. In accordance with instructions of the Directorate of General Security (Direcci√≥n General de Seguridad, DGS) the provincial governors of Spain assembled records of all Jews who lived in Spain, whether or not they were Spanish. Jorge Mart√≠nez Reverte has suggested that the resulting list, which recorded 6,000 Jews living in Spain, was handed to Heinrich Himmler's SS in 1941 and was included in Adolf Eichmann's Jewish Population Census, tabled at the Wannsee Conference, chaired by Reinhard Heydrich, in January 1942. Prewar As soon as the Spanish Civil War had ended, the Franco regime enacted legislation like the Law for the Suppression of Freemasonry and Communism of 1940, which legalised repressive actions against those who had supported the Spanish Republic since October 1934. Jews were not included, as according to √Ålvarez Chillida, the Alhambra Decree of 1492 had already neutralised the \\"Jewish threat\\" by its expulsion, and since it remained in force, there was no need for further legislation against the Jews. Otherwise, anti-Semitic rhetoric was present in statements made by Franco as well as his supporters and ideological allies since the late 1920s. Although the regime officially rejected racial anti-Semitism as contradictory to its National Catholic principles, but in practice, it was tolerated. On January 25, 1938, General Gonzalo Quiepo de Llano imposed a fine of 138,000 pesetas on the Jewish community of Seville 18 months after his forces took over the region. In one of his nightly radio broadcasts, he had accused the Jews of Spain of spending trillions of pesetas on the \\"promotion of Communism and the preparation of revolutions\\" by their tithes to the \\"supreme council, known as the Kahal\\". A department store founded by Jewish refugees in Zaragoza was also closed down and confiscated. In early 1939, one year after Franco's Directorate of General Security formally began police cooperation with the German Gestapo and before the military conflict came to an end, agents of the Gestapo raided the synagogue in Barcelona and committed a number of desecrations. The local authorities refused a hearing to the Jewish community, and German Jewish refugees who called on the German consulate general were also arrested. Wartime By 1940, a \\"Jewish department\\" was established, alongside the \\"Freemasonry department\\", under the direction of Eduardo Com√≠n Colomer. Both were incorporated into the anti-Marxism section of the Directorate of General Security, headed by Jos√© Finat y Escriv√° de Roman√≠, Count of Mayalde. Mayalde was \\"a representative of the fascistised Catholic Right who previously held the post of national delegate for information and investigation in the Falange and was very close to the cu√±ad√≠simo Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er\\". Furthermore, a so- called \\"Special Brigade\\" was created, at whose head Mayalde named the virulent anti-Semitic Mauricio Carlavilla. Its primary objective was to monitor Jews living in Spain as requested by Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfuhrer-SS and Chief of German Police in Nazi Germany. Mayalde had met Himmler in Berlin in September 1940, along with other senior SS personnel, including the Reich Main Security Office head, Reinhard Heydrich, and the Ordnungspolizei head, Kurt Daluege. The next month, Himmler visited Spain, where he met with Franco as well as Mayalde and Serrano Suner. It was on that occasion that Himmler expressed his variance with the way the Falange treated political enemies as racial enemies. Further arrangements were made for the exchange of exiled Republicans to Spain for persons wanted by Germany. The Jewish Archive was compiled covertly by the \\"Special Brigade\\" and consisted of police records provided by the provincial governors on \\"activities of Jewish character\\" that occurred in their jurisdictions. According to Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Jim√©nez, the Spanish police were usually able to hand over to Germany wanted persons. That collaboration came to a halt, as the tide of the Second World War changed. In May 1941, Mayalde stepped down as Director of General Security to take up the post as Spanish Ambassador to Berlin. Mayalde had issued the following circular to the provincial governors on May 5, his final day in the former post: The Archivo Judaico came about as a result, the abbreviation AJ appearing in the records. One of them concerned a woman in Barcelona with no known political affiliation: \\"Se le supone la peligrosidad propia de la raza jud√≠a (sefardita)\\". The word \\"Jew\\" would be written in red ink on permits. Jewish victims Spanish Jews who fell foul of Francoist legislation against Freemasonry and sympathy for the Spanish Republic included Jos√© Bleiberg, who committed suicide before being detained, as well as the president of the Jewish community of Barcelona. Bleiberg's sons Alberto and Germ√°n spent 4 years in jail. In the case of the poet Jorge Guill√©n, the authorities emphasised a Judeo-Bolshevik charge for his marriage to the Sephardic writer Cansinos Assens. The file read that \\"es jud√≠o, habiendo escrito varios libros y folletos en defensa del juda√≠smo. Es amigo del aventurero JOS√â ESTRUGO, dirigente del Socorro Rojo Internacional (he is a Jew, having written several books and pamphlets in defense of Judaism. He is a friend of the adventurer Jose Estrugo, leader of the International Red Aid)\\", and so he was denied a \\"carnet de periodista\\" necessary for his work. The Xueta people, though not officially targeted, received anonymous threats like \\"La Falange sabr√° expulsar a la ralea jud√≠a (The Falange know how to expel the Jewish rabble)\\". Towards the end of the war, the Jewish Archive, along with other materials that suggested knowledge of the \\"probable final destination of the Spanish Jews\\", was destroyed as the Franco regime sought to downplay its collaboration with the Axis powers to the United Nations and to emphasise its supposed role during the war in the ferrying of Jews through Spain from occupied Europe.

Part of the hammer is embedded in a limey rock concretion, leading to it being regarded by some as an anomalous artifact, asking how a seemingly man-made tool could come to be encased in a 400 million year old rock. It has been stated that carbon dating \\"showed inconclusive dates ranging from the present to 700 years ago.\\" History The hammer was purportedly found by a local couple, Max Hahn and his secret lover, while out walking along the course of the Red Creek near the town of London. They spotted a curious piece of loose rock with a bit of wood apparently embedded in it and took it home with them. A decade later, their son Max broke open the rock to find the concealed hammerhead within. The metal hammerhead is approximately long and has a diameter of , leading some to suggest that this hammer was not used for large projects, but rather for fine work or soft metal. The metal of the hammerhead has been confirmed to consist of 96.6% iron, 2.6% chlorine, and 0.74% sulfur. The hammerhead has not rusted since its discovery in the mid-1930s. The Hammer began to attract wider attention after it was bought by creationist Carl Baugh in 1983, who claimed the artifact was a \\"monumental 'pre-Flood' discovery.\\" He has used it as the basis of speculation of how the atmospheric quality of a pre-flood earth could have encouraged the growth of giants. The hammer is now an exhibit in Baugh's Creation Evidence Museum, which sells replicas of it to visitors. Other observers have noted that the hammer is stylistically consistent with typical American tools manufactured in the region in the late 1800s. Its design is consistent with a miner's hammer. One possible explanation for the rock containing the artifact is that the highly soluble minerals in the ancient limestone may have formed a concretion around the object, via a common process (like that of a petrifying well) which often creates similar encrustations around fossils and other nuclei.

Development  Egan's eclectic model was developed amid the shift in the field of counselling and psychotherapy from the adherence to the \\"pure\\" schools of therapy and the search for the most effective approach to the embrace and integration of all mainstream approaches that appear to be universally effective. It is also influenced by the works of Carl Rogers and Robert Carkhuff, particularly these authors' theories on person-centered values and principles. Egan introduced his approach through the book The Skilled Helper, which was published in 1975. In this book, Egan explained that eclecticism is successful because it allows clients to: 1) identify and explore problems and opportunities; 2) determine their needs and wants; 3) discover for themselves how to obtain them; and, 4) act based on what they learned.  Model  Egan's eclectic model was first proposed as a humanistic framework but it increasingly adopted a more action-oriented form of therapy later on. Egan likened the model to the browser in the sense that, like this Internet tool, it can be used to mine, organize, and evaluate concepts and techniques that work for clients regardless of their background. Its eclectic orientation also means that the framework makes of techniques regardless of their theoretical origin. The developmental eclecticism process involves three stages, which are Exploration, Understanding, and Action and each of these entails a set of associated skills. The first stage is focused on the client as the therapist attempts to build a rapport, understanding his experiences and his goal in the process if successful. Understanding or the interpretation stage requires the therapist to formulate the problem using techniques such as psychodynamic and cognitive approaches. Finally, the Action stage uses behavioral strategies (e.g. homework assignments). Egan's three stages were later renamed as Present Scenario, Preferred Scenario, and Getting There.

The farm is located on three rooftops in Brooklyn and Queens. The first rooftop farm was established in 2010 on a 43,000 square feet building straddling Astoria and Long Island City areas. The second location was built in 2012 atop the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the third farm, established in 2019, is located at Liberty View in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. All three locations encompass 140,000 square feet of space, making it the largest rooftop farm in New York City. Annually, of organic vegetables are grown. The Grange also operates New York City's largest apiary, with over 40 naturally managed beehives, which yields approximately of honey annually. The Grange was co-founded in April of 2010 by Ben Flanner (President), Anastasia Plakias (Vice President), and Gwen Schantz (COO). The group took out loans, contributed their own savings, and found initial investors to fund the project. The Brooklyn Navy Yard farm was financed in part by a grant from the NYCDEP's Green Infrastructure Grant Program. Brooklyn Grange provides urban farming, green roof consulting, and installation services to clients worldwide as well as partner with numerous non-profit organizations throughout New York.  Background  left All three farms consist of green roof systems laid down before the soil. For the first farm off of Northern Blvd, the construction took six days of craning of soil sacks, seven building stories up to the roof. Brooklyn Grange laid down a series of drainage plates distributed by Conservation Technologies. The system is as follows: a layer of root-barrier, which prevents the plants‚Äô roots from penetrating the surface of the roof; a thick layer of felt; drainage mats with small cups to hold excess water from heavy rainstorms (the soil and plants wick this stored water up in dry conditions to keep water use down), and finally, a thin layer of felt to prevent the drainage mats from filling up with soil. At the Brooklyn Navy Yard location the farm has a green roof system which consists of a lightweight drainage aggregate, with a layer of similar felt above to filter the solid particles and keep the system together. The soil is sourced from Skyland, Pennsylvania, a green roof media supplier. Almost a million pounds of the blend made up of Rooflite, an engineered soil mix that contains no actual soil, has been utilized. The stones from the Rooflite material make the soil lighter in weight and also slowly break down to add trace minerals needed for plant nutrition. The beds are about to deep and include shallow walkways.  Brooklyn Farmer  Brooklyn Grange's expansion is documented in the 2013 film Brooklyn Farmer, which premiered at Doc NYC in November 2013. The documentary follows the Brooklyn Grange team as they expanded their farm to the second rooftop location at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It also explored the unique challenges inherent in operating a large, urban rooftop farm. The film focused on Head Farmer Ben Flanner to explore the day-to-day operations of the farm and COO Gwen Schantz to look at the organization as a business. The film was directed by Michael Tyburski and produced by Burke Cherrie and Ben Nabors in association with Group Theory.

These reports would be due every Monday until March 31, 2015 and would be available to the public. The bill would \\"require weekly updates on the number of unique website visitors, new accounts, and new enrollments in a qualified health plan, as well as the level of coverage,\\" separating the data by state. The bill would also require reports on efforts to fix the broken portions of the website. The bill was introduced on October 29, 2013 in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The House was scheduled to vote on it on January 10, 2014. On January 16th, 2014, the bill was passed. 226 Republicans and 33 Democrats have voted yes to the bill. Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA),, , codified as amended at scattered sections of the Internal Revenue Code and in 42 U.S.C. commonly called the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or \\"Obamacare\\", is a United States federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act,, , codified as amended at scattered sections of the Internal Revenue Code and in 42 U.S.C., 19 U.S.C., and 20 U.S.C. it represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The ACA was enacted with the goals of increasing the quality and affordability of health insurance, lowering the uninsured rate by expanding public and private insurance coverage, and reducing the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government. It introduced a number of mechanisms‚Äîincluding mandates, subsidies, and insurance exchanges‚Äîmeant to increase coverage and affordability. Healthcare.gov is a healthcare exchange website created by and operated under the United States federal government as per the provisions of the PPACA, designed to serve the residents of the thirty-six U.S. states that opted not to create their own state exchanges. Americans had until December 23, 2013 to sign up for coverage that would begin in January 2014. The official enrollment period deadline is the last day of March. The PPACA detailed the exchange system as a way to comparison shop between different possible health insurance options for an individual within his or her state, with a visual format somewhat analogous to websites such as Amazon.com and Etsy. The contract allocated to CGI Group for building the federal website (Healthcare.gov) was valued at $292 million through to 2013, with estimates that the overall cost for building the website had reached over $500 million by October 2013.We paid over $500 million for the Obamacare sites and all we got was this lousy 404 by Andrew Couts, Digital Trends, October 8, 2013 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast that about seven million Americans would use the website to obtain coverage during the first year after its launch. The October 1, 2013 roll-out of Healthcare.gov went through as planned, despite the concurrent partial government shutdown. The website has been marred by serious technological problems since its launch, making it difficult for Americans to sign up for health insurance. On October 27, only about seven hundred thousand people filed applications, with even fewer actually enrolled in plans. On October 20, President Barack Obama made a thirty-minute Rose Garden appearance discussing the varied issues. \\"There's no sugar coating: the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am,\\" he remarked. Promising a \\"tech surge\\" of the best people that his administration could assemble, he added, \\"there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed.\\" Issues with Healthcare.gov have persisted weeks past the launch, with the website unable to reach its related data services hub on October 28. Said glitches have particularly beleaguered Health and Human Services head Kathleen Sebelius. As of November 30, over 137,000 people have obtained insurance coverage from Healthcare.gov, a figure representing the strong improvement of the user experience since October yet still vastly trailing past U.S. government estimates. The Exchange Information Disclosure Act would require the Obama Administration to provide more information related to these problems to Congress and the American public. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Exchange Information Disclosure Act would amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to expand reporting requirements related to health care exchanges. The bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish reports weekly through March 31, 2015, on: :(1) consumer interactions with healthcare.gov or subsequent sites and any efforts undertaken to remedy problems that impact taxpayers and consumers; :(2) calls to the federal customer service call center, including the number of calls received by the call center, problems identified by users, and referrals of those calls; :(3) all navigators and certified application counselors that have been trained and certified by health care exchanges; and :(4) all agents and brokers who have been trained and certified by the federal health care exchange. Procedural history The Exchange Information Disclosure Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on October 29, 2013 by Rep. Lee Terry (R, NE-2). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On January 3, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be on the schedule for the week of January 6, 2014. Debate and discussion Supporters of the bill argue that it would help Congress and the American people judge and follow the progress of the ACA. Republicans argue that the bill is necessary because the Obama Administration has refused to provide information about usage of healthcare.gov and enrollment in new health insurance plans. Heritage Action notes that the bill is \\"designed to increase transparency in the operation of American Health Benefits Exchanges\\" in response to security and transparency failures, but believes \\"the only acceptable solution is to repeal the law entirely and replace it was a market-based, patient-centered alternative.\\" Some Republicans have also asked for additional information related to Obamacare that is not required in this bill. These Republicans are asking for information about the number of people who have actually paid their first monthly bill and to what degree the enrollees are young, healthy people, versus those who will likely need medical care. One provision of the bill requires that a list of healthcare navigators be provided, with contact and affiliation information. This is a response to criticism that some navigators have been encouraging people to lie on their enrollment forms to get better deals. Senator Lamar Alexander, who introduced similar legislation in the Senate, argued in favor of the bill. Alexander noted that \\"with WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden spilling our beans every day, what's happening on the Obamacare exchanges is the only secret left in Washington... the National Security Administration should learn some lessons from Secretary Sebelius.\\" Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent wrote that the vote on the Exchange Information Disclosure Act would \\"be partly about reassuring the base that GOP leaders are still taking the fight to Obamacare, dammit!!!\\" Sargent argued that the bill was \\"a political attack coming from a party that wants to see the law fail,\\" even if some people would be interested in the actual data.

It was set up in Aleppo under the command of Hilal Hilal, the current Assistant Regional Secretary, after rebels took most of the eastern half of Aleppo in summer 2012. Initially, the Ba'ath Brigades were used to guard government buildings and other key installations in the city, but their role has expanded as their strength has grown from 5,000 members in November 2012 to 7,000 in December 2013. Units have since also formed in Latakia and Tartus. At the end of 2013, the Brigades began deploying in Damascus, tasked with manning checkpoints and conducting \\"light logistical operations\\". They spearheaded the assault on the Old City of Aleppo in early 2014. The Ba'ath Battalions participated in lifting the three-year siege at Kuweires military airbase alongside the elite Cheetah Forces, and National Defence Forces. The Baath Brigades were previously led by Ra‚Äôed bin ‚ÄòAli al-Ghadban - a high- ranking member of the Ba'ath Party's Deir ez-Zor branch. He resigned as the brigades' commander in 2017 to become a member of the central committee of the party, as well as a member of the Syrian government's delegation to the Sochi peace talks in the context of the Syrian peace process. On 27 February 2017, Col. Salama Mohammed, a high-ranking Ba'ath Brigades commander and leader of the group's Tartus Governorate branch, was reportedly killed in action while fighting in the area around Hama. Some claimed, however, that Mohammed had instead died of a heart attack. The Ba'ath Legion of the Syrian Army's 5th Corps was formed from Ba'ath Brigades volunteers. By mid 2018 , the Syrian government began to disband the Ba'ath brigades, as well as other pro- government militias, integrating parts of them into the Syrian Army. Following the Idlib demilitarization agreement in September of 2018, the Ba'ath Brigades were dissolved. The group's then leader, Jihad Barakat, announced on his facebook page that ‚ÄúThe military operations conducted by Baath forces have completely ended‚Äù.

The word Sada means \\"finally\\" or \\"at last\\" in isiXhosa because the first settlers struggled to find a place before they settled in the area in 1964. History Sada, established in 1964, was one of the first forced resettlement camps established in the Hewu area. The settlement was established as a rural township for victims of forced removals from white-owned Sada from Shiloh's agricultural land in 1964. The land had been bought by the South African Bantu Trust (which was later renamed as the South African Development Trust) from Shiloh, an old Moravian mission station. The portion of land bought had been used as Shiloh's cattle post. The population of Sada was only made up of residents from the Whittlesea area but as time went on the initial population was later joined by other people evicted from farms in Tarkastad and Adelaide. By the time Sada was proclaimed as a self-contained Bantu town it had over 8,000 people. According to a report by Mr F.O. Joseph, the Regional Secretary in the East London Institute of Race Relations said in a report published on Race Relations News in 1972 the shacks were replaced by four-roomed houses. There was a tap and pit latrine every 400 metres. The four-roomed houses were rented for R2,75 or R2,95 depending on whether there was a cement floor or not. Mr Joseph further stated that 46 men and 225 women were employed at vegetable gardens, brickyard, a dressmaking concern at the Moravia Mission and a handicraft while 572 men and 1000 women were unemployed. In the early 1970s, displaced inhabitants erected tiny houses made of mud and established an extension of Sada, called Emadakeni (meaning The Mud Place in isiXhosa). Between 1974-1977 people arrived from Macibini Township, Glen Grey, Queenstown, Molteno, Cofimvaba, Port Alfred and as far as the Western Cape. Sada also provided a home for political activists who were banished from Transvaal after the Sharpeville Massacre, and ex-Robben Island prisoners settled in the area. Refugees from Herschel and Sterkspruit moved mostly to Thornhill, Glen Grey inhabitants resettled at the nearby Zweledinga, Oxton and Sada. 50 000-70 000 residents had arrived in Sada (and the Hewu area) within nine months, by April 1977. In 1979, Sada was incorporated into the Ciskei Bantustan. An urban zone, Dongwe or Ekuphumleni (Whittlesea North), consolidated Sada, absorbed those who did not receive rural land as well as the class of civil servants that had been emerging from the early 1980s. Despite political fights between students and the Ciskei government in the 1980s, the area was then incorporated into the Eastern Cape of the new South Africa in 1994. Economy At the height of industrialisation in the 1980s, Sada was home to 8 factories owned by Taiwanese and some South Africans. These factories included Royal Textiles, Golden Knitting and Edward Frank Manufacturers which at some stage employed more than 1500 people. However, those factories are no longer existing. In the early 1990s SACTTWU led various strikes which saw the factories closing. The area is supplied with water for human consumption and irrigation of agricultural crops by the Klipplaat River, that flows out of the Waterdown Dam stream-up. In the early 1990s the Shiloh farm which had been active in the 1980s was neglected. However, the scheme has been rejuvenated and now houses Nkosi Wines. Whittlesea provides administrative and shopping facilities for the residents of Sada, and the Hewu Hospital is also located nearby.

The film is dedicated to Jerry Mann, a former bassist for Skum who died in 2011. Background Skum was formed in early 1984 by a group of students at the College of William & Mary. The founding members, Hart Baur, Todd, and Scott Bell, were all on the men's soccer team at William & Mary. Their initial performance consisted of cover versions of contemporary rock songs played at a local Williamsburg bar. None of the initial members of the band had any background in music, though they soon recruited Jon Tarrant, who had studied at the Royal Academy of Music. The band members considered their own music to be of poor quality, but persisted in playing for their own enjoyment. Skum sabotaged some of their own gigs rather than have their lack of talent exposed. For example, they distributed beer at an early show and then called the police, who broke up the gathering before the conclusion of their first song; later, they quit a battle of the bands due to the venue's supposedly poor sound quality. The band used an improvised road crew by offering beer to homeless people in Williamsburg. Skum Records at Sun Studios in Memphis TN April 2013 Despite these beginnings, Skum relocated to the Miami area, the home town of Baur, after some its members graduated. The band had a brief life in Miami but split up after the recordings of Lost at the Circus, their debut album, were lost. Description Skum Rocks! consists of interviews with band members along with commentary from celebrities, with a format similar to that of the TV series Behind the Music. Kevin Bacon, Matthew Broderick, Fran Drescher, and Ron Jeremy were the top-billed celebrities featured; others included Steve-O, Brooke Hogan, and Phil Donahue. Jon Stewart, who was in the film, was also on the William & Mary soccer team. He graduated in 1984, whereas the original members of Skum graduated between 1985 and 1987. Skum Rocks! was partially funded by Kickstarter. Skum Rocks! premieres at Raindance Film Festival September 2013 The film premiered September 26, 2013 in London, at the 2013 Raindance Film Festival. Some members of the band attended the premiere and held a question and answer session afterward. Skum Rocks! was apparently enjoyed by Manchester United players Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney. Skum Rocks! premieres in Hollywood at Dances With Films Festival in May 2014 Skum Rocks! was also a selection of Dances With Films 17, and held its Hollywood premiere on May 30, 2014 at the Chinese 6 Theatres on Hollywood Boulevard. Producer Clay Westervelt of Imaginaut Entertainment was in attendance, along with Skum members Hart Baur, John Eaton, and Tommy Craig. Notable guests at the premiere were Frankie Banali, Phoenix Benjamin, Monique Parent, and Angela Dodson. Skum Records at Abbey Road Studios in September 2013 In connection with the film, a new iteration of Skum played a show on January 17, 2014, in Melbourne, Florida. The reunion show was filmed as a \\"final scene\\" for the documentary. Skum held a benefit concert for CHARLEE of Dade County in conjunction with the Miami premiere of Skum Rocks! at the Miami Beach Colony Theatre on March 7, 2015.http://charlee.org/wp- content/themes/charlee/assets/skumrock.pdf The afterparty benefit for CHARLEE was held at the Grand Central performance venue in Miami, and included performances by Skum, Quiet Riot, Eddie Money, and The Urge. Among many rock journalists who followed Skum, Michael Wench of Rock World Magazine (1984-1990) wrote, \\"Despite a complete lack of talent and ambition . . . they owned the media and avoided playing at all costs.

History Following their successful coup against the Social Democrat-composed cabinet of Gyula Peidl, the counter- revolutionary White House Comrades Association had established the Christian National Party. Count P√°l Teleki, who returned from exile, was elected its chairman, but the actual leader was Istv√°n Friedrich, a key figure of the coup, who became Prime Minister on 7 August 1919. The party received support from conservative and Roman Catholic bourgeoisie and monarchist elements, mostly civil servants, industrialists and intellectuals. The KNP published its programme (\\"Christian Hungarian Brothers\\") with the permission of censorship by the Romanian authorities who occupied Budapest after the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. The document contained some anti-Semitic and anti- democratic points. The party also demanded universal suffrage and the \\"recovery of Hungarian economic and cultural hegemony\\". Beside Friedrich, prominent members of the party were , Ferenc Schnetzer, K√°roly Ereky, , , all were ministers in the Friedrich cabinet. As the Catholic Church in Hungary urged the merger of Christian parties on a permanent basis, majority of KNP merged with the majority of the Christian Social and Economic Party (KSZGP) to form the Christian National Union Party (KNEP) on 25 October 1919. Friedrich was elected leader of the new party. The remaining party contested national elections in 1920, winning two seats in the parliamentary elections that year.Dieter Nohlen & Philip St√∂ver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p907 Due to the presence of a number of strong personalities, however, KNEP quickly began to fragment. On 12 April 1920, Friedrich and his other six MPs left the party and re-joined KNP. He was elected chairman of the party after that. Basically, the KNP remained a parliamentary group with the lack of mass support. In the October 1921 by-election, their only candidate received 0.56 percent of the vote. After the Hungarian parliament declared the dethronement of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, Gyula Andr√°ssy the Younger and ten other aristocrats left the KNEP to join KNP on 14 January 1922. Two days later the party was renamed to Christian National Agricultural Workers' and Civic Party (KNFPP), more commonly known as the Andr√°ssy-Friedrich Party. In the 1922 elections, the remaining part of the party lost both seats, receiving just 0.2% of the national vote.

A party of some 1,000 Polish insurgents, commanded by Ludwik Zwierzdowski and Apolinary Kurowski, tried to capture the town, which was defended by an 800-strong garrison of the Imperial Russian Army. The battle ended in Russian victory; Russian losses were estimated at app. 50 killed, while Poles lost 50 killed and 62 wounded. In February 1864, Russian general Ksawery Czengiery concentrated some 4,500 soldiers in the area of Sandomierz, Opatow, Stopnica and Staszow. Polish insurgents in the region had app. 1,000 armed men. Since Polish general J√≥zef Hauke-Bosak was in other location, these forces were commanded by Apolinary Kurowski and Ludwik Top√≥r-Zwierzdowski. Both decided to attack the Russians in their weakest point, and then capture Opatow. They underestimated Russian forces, which defended the town. Polish attack on Opatow began in the evening of February 21. The rebels managed to seize 75% of the town, including Russian barracks with a number of rifles kept there. Due to desperate Russian resistance, their advance was checked after several hours. At midnight, Kurowski ordered his men to leave the town, as he feared Russian reinforcements, marching from Sandomierz. On the next day, Russians captured Ludwik Zwierzdowski, and hanged him at Opatow's market square on February 23.  Sources  * Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.

Hockey career Born in Uxbridge, Ontario, Oke played junior ice hockey with the Uxbridge Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) team from 1902 until 1904. He played one further season of junior with the Sault Ste. Marie Tagonas of the Northern Ontario League. Oke became a professional with the Haileybury Hockey Club in the Timiskaming Professional Hockey League in 1906. He played in three seasons with Haileybury. In 1912, Oke signed with the new Toronto Tecumsehs, playing one season with the club. In 1913‚Äì14, he played with Halifax, and in 1914‚Äì15, he played with the Toronto Blueshirts. In 1926, Oke was one of the founders of the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL), in which he owned the Kitchener Millionaires. Oke purchased the Toronto team in the Can-Pro league in 1928 and moved the Millionaires players to Toronto for one year, splitting the players with a new team in Kitchener, the Kitchener Flying Dutchmen. In 1929, the International Hockey League was formed and the team was renamed the Toronto Falcons. It played one season before disbanding. Oke would do double duty that season, replacing the coach, Hughie Lehman. That season the CPHL was continued as a supplier league to the IHL, and Kitchener continued for one season in that league.

A party of 210 Polish rebels, commanded by J√≥zef Hauke-Bosak, managed to temporarily capture the town, which was defended by a 180-strong garrison of the Imperial Russian Army. Polish rebels took advantage of the fact that main Russian forces had left Opatow, to chase rebel units operating near the town of Ilza. Hauke-Bossak ordered an attack from three sides. Weak Russian garrison was unable to defend the town, and was pushed out of Opatow. Poles captured the town and withdrew with seized Russian guns and ammunition towards Suchedniow.

Biography Born in Na≈°ice, his first art lessons were obtained in Osijek, where he studied with Hugo Conrad von H√∂tzendorf. He then went to Vienna to study philosophy and art history. At this time, he was already providing aesthetic and philosophical articles to Croatian journals. He later studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and lived in Italy from 1872‚Äì77, where he copied the old masters. With the help of Josip Juraj Strossmayer, who he had met in Rome, he became a professor of archaeology and art history at the University of Zagreb. The next year, he helped establish the Society of Arts, and was, for many years, it secretary and spokesman. He also served as the first Director of the Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters and was one of the founders of the Museum of Arts and Crafts. In 1884, he came into conflict with Strossmayer and his supporters in the People's Party, where he supported the pro-Hungarian faction, which allowed him to serve in the Croatian Parliament 1884-87. From 1887 to 1891, he studied law and became the Minister of Education and Religion in the K√°roly Khuen-H√©derv√°ry administration. While in that office, he established several schools, including one for the blind and deaf, introduced physical education classes and helped to form the foundation for a unified school system. He had to leave the ministry in 1897, after a protest in which he burned a Hungarian flag. He returned to the University and, in 1906, joined the Party of Rights. Shortly thereafter, he began painting again. In addition to being a painter and critic, he also translated Dante's Divine Comedy into Croatian and was the author of poems, travelogues and two novels. He died in Zagreb. In Croatian film Countess Dora (1993) he is played by Relja Ba≈°iƒá.

He was the mastermind of the March 8, 1971, FBI office break-in, in Media, Pennsylvania, and the informal leader of the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI which led to the disclosure of COINTELPRO, which in turn led to subsequent investigations and reforms of the FBI.https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/1971/characters.html Life Davidon was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1927. He attended Purdue University and graduated from the University of Chicago with a Ph.D. in 1957. From 1954 to 1956, he was a research associate at the Enrico Fermi Institute. From 1956 to 1961, he was an associate physicist at the Argonne National Laboratory, where he developed the first quasi-Newton algorithm, now known as the Davidon‚ÄìFletcher‚ÄìPowell formula. He was professor of physics at Haverford College, beginning in 1961, and then Professor of Mathematics, as his interests shifted to include mathematical logic, set theory and non-standard analysis. He retired in 1991. He was a 1966 Fulbright Scholar. Davidon moved to Highlands Ranch, Colorado, in 2010. He died November 8, 2013, of Parkinson's disease. Activism In 1966, he traveled to South Vietnam, with A. J. Muste, sponsored by the Committee for Non-Violent Action. He also announced that year that he would be refusing to pay his federal income tax in protest against the Vietnam War.Associated Press \\"Doctor to Lose Scholarship If He Refuses to Pay Tax\\" ca. 15 April 1966 Later, he became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project, which practiced and advocated tax resistance as a form of anti-war protest.\\"A Call to War Tax Resistance\\" The Cycle 14 May 1970, p. 7 In 1971, he was named an \\"unindicted co-conspirator\\" in the Harrisburg Seven case. He was on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union, Philadelphia affiliate. As the leader of the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI, Davidon was instrumental in planning and organizing a break-in of the FBI's Media, Pennsylvania office. The documents stolen there led to the disclosure of COINTELPRO. According to The Burglary, a book published shortly after his death, Davidon also had engaged in draft board raids, stealing or destroying files, and subsequent to Media participated in two acts of sabotage against military materiel intended for use in Vietnam. Due at least in part to his exceptionally careful planning and his co- conspirators' total commitment to secrecy and discretion, neither he nor anyone else was ever charged in any of those actions, despite an intense, five-year FBI investigation. Family In 1963, Davidon married Ann Morrissett (1925‚Äì2004), a noted pacifist/feminist essayist and activist. They had two daughters (one of whom, Ruth, became an Olympic rower).

It is a largely metal pod and boom aircraft, with cantilever shoulder wings. The wing has a thickness/chord ratio of 15.3% and a simple straight tapered plan with square tips, built around a single spar. It made use of plastic foams, both in the light alloy-foam sandwich ribs and with a rigid foam honeycomb structure between the ribs to support the skin. The whole trailing edge is filled with control surfaces; inboard of the ailerons there are camber changing flaps divided into two parts, the inner section deflecting through greater angles than the outer. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are fitted at inboard at mid-chord, opening above and below the wing. The wings also contain rubber bags to hold up to of water ballast, with a dump valve in the fuselage behind the undercarriage monowheel. The pod of the forward fuselage is a steel tube structure, clad in a glass fibre shell which ends just aft of the trailing edge. The pilot sits in a semi-reclining position ahead of the leading edge, under a long perspex canopy. This is removable and reaches almost to the nose, where there is a small, fixed windscreen. Behind the wing the tail boom is a slender, riveted light alloy tube that bolts to the steel tubing of the pod. The tail is conventional, though the straight tapered, square tipped fin and rudder are noticeably tall, with the similarly shaped tailplane and elevators mounted a little way above the boom. The tail surfaces, with the exception of the fabric covered rudder, follow the wing construction. The landing gear consists of a monowheel, fitted with a drum brake and manually retractable into the fuselage where it is enclosed above two doors, assisted by a fixed tailwheel. The FK-3 was built by apprentices at the VFW (Vereinitige Flugtechnische Werke) German factory at Speyer and flew for the first time on 24 April 1968. It had immediate success at the national championship level: the prototype won the 1968 Italian contest and in the same year two FK-3s became winner and runner-up at the Austrian competition. Production began in January 1969 at the rate of about one a week. Some sources suggest that eleven examples were built. Three remained on the German civil aircraft register in 2010. Variants ;RFB Sirius: One FK-3 was converted in 1969 by Rhein-Flugzeugbau (RFB) into a motor glider powered by an eight bladed ducted fan built into the rear of the pod, with its direct drive engine immediately ahead. Initially a flat four, air-cooled Nelson two stroke engine was fitted, but this was subsequently replaced first by a pair of Yamaha motor-cycle engines, then by two Finkel and Sachs Wankel engines, each producing . It began a series of developments by RFB of the fuselage mounted ducted fan concept, through the Sirius II to the 1977 Fantrainer.

The house is now a hotel. History The present house was constructed c.1795 for Sir Benjamin Hammet, a wealthy entrepreneur from Taunton, Somerset, who bought the estate in 1791. It is built in three storeys of local Cilgerran stone with a hipped slate roof, a five-bay frontage and a two-storey wing. It replaced a previous house and was originally named Castle Malgwyn. Hammet, who founded and co-owned the bank of Esdaile, Hammet & Co. was elected MP for his home town of Taunton in 1782. He had originally bought the estate to acquire the associated tinplate works at nearby Penygored. He was given permission to close the public road from Llechryd to Cilgerran which ran through the estate and to reroute it further south to skirt the estate. This entailed building the Castell Malgwyn bridge over the \\"canal\\", a conduit which fed water to the tinworks, and Hammet Bridge over the Morgenau brook. The grounds were landscaped by local landscaper, Charles Price. Castle Malgwyn Stable Block After Hammet's death in 1802 the estate passed to his son, John. By 1806 the works were demolished and on John's early death in 1811 the house contents were sold. When Sir Benjamin's wife Lady Louisa died in 1824 the estate was sold to Abel Anthony Gower of Glandovan, who let the property. On Gower's death in 1837 his nephew, Abel Lewes Gower, inherited and moved in, investing a large amount of money on improving the property, commissioning Ambrose Poynter to build the lodge, grand entrance and stable court. When he also died young in 1849 his widow remained in residence until her own death in 1886, when it passed to Abel Lewes's brother, Robert Frederick Gower, who had also inherited Glandovan from their father. Castell Malgwyn passed down in the Gower family until it was sold in 1948, and became a hotel in 1962. The house was renamed Hammet House in 2012.

Plot Test pilot Joe Kovak (Stanley Clements) work for Sam Bentley (John Litel), the former partner of Joe's deceased father. Because Joe's father was killed while flying, however, his mother (Dorothy Adams) is afraid for her son. Bentley is competing for an important government contact but Joe is putting the effort into jeopardy as his brash attitude and propensity in disobeying orders, is becoming troublesome. Bentley's rival, Oscar Collins (Tom Powers), wants Joe to work for his company, capitalizing on the test pilot's ability to fly high speed aircraft. When Bentley finally is fed up with Joe's defiance, and fires him, Collins gives his public relations manager, Marge Stevens (Elena Verdugo), a $500 bonus to get Joe to sign with his company. Infatuated with Marge, Joe signs on but finds the Collins aircraft is inferior and during a test flight, after being asked to fly too high, their prototype crashes. Joe escapes unharmed, but before an investigation board, Collins blames Joe for the accident, resulting in Joe's flight license being revoked. When Joe learns about Marge's bonus, he is more determined to prove he can be the best test pilot around, but has to find his way back into the cockpit. Discovering that Bentley has planned a test flight to demonstrate his aircraft to the government, Joe sneaks into the plant and is able to fly the test flight. Government officials award Bentley Aircraft the lucrative contact. Joe gets his licence back and returns to work with Bentley Aircraft, and is able to accept that Marge is in love with him.

In February 2017, Tsai Ingwen's government declares as aboriginal ancestral territories a series of public lands.https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2020/01/22/a-taiwan- la-resistance-des-aborigenes_6026825_3210.html Panai denounces the moves as insuficient since it does not returns lands previously taken and now owned by private entities, including notorious mines. Panai objection is based on 2 principles: the right of surviving aboriginal tribes to get back their whole territories, and the request for an autonomy consistent enough so aboriginal community could negotiate as equal with the government. Panai was therefore one of the leaders of the Indigenous Ketagalan Boulevard Protest concerning the delineation of traditional lands of Taiwanese aborigines. On February 23, she occupied using tents the grass ground facing the Presidential Office Building, but was moved out 100 days later, installing herself near a metro entrance, and after 600 (January 2019) had to move again to a nearby park. As of early 2020, Panai and her husband are still protesting there.

Promoted by MGM as a successor to its award-winning Boys Town hit of 1938, the film is loosely based on ex-wrestler Cal Farley's Boys Ranch near Amarillo, Texas. The film was shot on location near Amarillo.Thames, Stephanie. Boys' Ranch, tcm.com (Retrieved June 19, 2019). Plot Dan Walker, having retired from professional baseball, is concerned about the plight of neglected youth in his Texas town and persuades a group of community leaders to start a livestock ranch as a resident facility for troubled and neglected boys, to develop good character and self-reliance in a wholesome outdoor environment. The men urge Walker to run the ranch and wealthy landowner Davis Banton agrees to permit use of a portion of his property to set up the ranch on a provisional basis. Two of the boys, \\"Hank\\" and \\"Skippy\\", are the main protagonists. Hank is sincere and good-hearted, but repeatedly clashes with a cynical and devious Skippy, who mocks Hank as a \\"trusty\\". Skippy's misbehavior and thievery eventually cause the neighboring townspeople to call for the ranch's closing. The ongoing conflict between the two boys culminates in a fight in a cemetery when Hank tries to prevent Skippy from running away during a heavy rainstorm. Hank is rendered unconscious when he is knocked backwards and hits his head on a gravestone. Later, after he learns that Hank never returned to the ranch and is missing, Skippy returns to the scene of the fight and discovers the still-unconscious Hank perilously close to drowning in the rising floodwaters. Braving the raging torrent of water, Skippy rescues Hank. Remorseful that his misbehavior has caused so much harm and nearly cost Hank his life, Skippy tearfully confesses to the thefts and returns the stolen items, his reform complete. Cast * James Craig as Dan Walker * Dorothy Patrick as Susan Walker * Ray Collins as Davis Banton * Skip Homeier as Skippy * Darryl Hickman as Hank * Jackie \\"Butch\\" Jenkins as Butch * Sharon McManus as Mary Walker * Minor Watson as Mr. Harper * Arthur Space as Mr. O'Neill * Robert Emmett O'Connor as Druggist * Moroni Olsen as Judge Henderson Reception The comedic element added by Jackie Jenkins as \\"Butch\\" was praised by Variety, which said his \\"every appearance is a guaranteed chuckle\\". According to MGM records the movie earned $1,124,000 in the US and Canada and $378,000 elsewhere, for total revenue of $1,502,000. Boys' Ranch occasionally airs on Turner Classic Movies.

During its existence, the F48P strongly opposed the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The party was revived after the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and restoration of the monarchy. History The Party of Independence and '48 was established in 1884 by a merger of the Independence Party and the Party of 1848.Vincent E McHale (1983) Political parties of Europe, Greenwood Press, p509 Lajos Kossuth was its spiritual leader until he died in 1894, and the party was also referred to as the \\"Kossuth Party\\" thereafter. From the 1896 elections onwards, it was the main opposition to the ruling Liberal Party. It won the 1905 and 1906 elections, but it lost the 1910 elections to the National Party of Work. By this time the party was beginning to split into factions. Ferenc Kossuth and Albert Apponyi led a right-wing grouping that supported an alliance with Germany, whilst Gyula Justh and later Mih√°ly K√°rolyi led a left-wing faction that opposed working with Germany. In 1916 the party split when K√°rolyi left to establish the United Party of Independence and '48, with K√°rolyi becoming Prime Minister in 1918. Following World War I, the party was severely weakened. It failed to win a seat in the 1920 elections. It ran in the 1922 elections as the Independence and '48 Kossuth Party, winning one seat, which it retained in the 1926 elections.Dieter Nohlen & Philip St√∂ver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p929 By 1931 the party had adopted its final name, the National Independence Kossuth Party (). The elections that year saw it lose its single seat. In the 1935 elections it won a single seat, running on a joint list with the National Radical Party in one multi-member constituency.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p920Nohlen & St√∂ver, p930 The party did not contest the 1939 elections, and was dissolved on 13 April 1945 when it merged into the Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party.

While a national flag is usually used by the population at large and is flown outside and on ships, a national coat of arms is normally considered a symbol of the government or (especially in monarchies) the head of state personally and tends to be used in print, on heraldic china, and as a wall decoration in official buildings. The royal arms of a monarchy, which may be identical to the national arms, are sometimes described as arms of dominion or arms of sovereignty. An important use for national coats of arms is as the main symbol on the covers of passports, the document used internationally to prove the citizenship of a person. Another use for national coats of arms is as a symbol on coins of the associated state for general circulation. For a symbol to be called a \\"national coat of arms\\", it should follow the rules of heraldry. If it does not, then the symbol is not formally a coat of arms but rather a national emblem. However, many unheraldic national emblems are colloquially called national coats of arms anyway, because they are used for the same purposes as national coats of arms.  Types of national coats of arms = Heraldic achievements = The Finnish coat of arms on the front cover of a Finnish passport with both Swedish and Finnish text. The original national coats of arms were (and continue to be) heraldic arms, which have a shield (escutcheon) which carries symbols upon it (charges) and often other symbols such as a crown on top of the shield and supporters. In the real sense of the word, these national coats of arms are the only ones which should be called coats of arms, since that term reflects that the emblem used is following the rules of heraldry. Heraldry originated in Western Europe and has now spread to all parts of the world. Up until the 20th century, most independent nations in the civilized world were monarchies and therefore used the monarchistic style of coat of arms. This style is illustrated below by the Swedish Greater Arms and the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, both of which are still in use. Characteristic of this style are the escutcheon (shield) of the kingdom, the supporters on either side (usually beasts as in these cases, but may also be birds, fishes, humans/humanoids or even inanimate objects as depicted on the coat of arms of Spain) and the crown topping the arms. The crown on the UK arms is specifically St Edward's Crown. Both also feature a symbol of the monarch's chivalric order encircling the escutcheon: the chain of the Order of the Seraphim on the Swedish arms and the belt of the Order of the Garter on the UK's arms. A motto is often present either below or above the escutcheon (as shown on the UK arms); this is absent on the Swedish arms. In common with many European monarchies, the Swedish arms features a representation of a royal robe (see mantle and pavilion) topped with another crown, which became common around the 19th century (and which can also be seen in the Romanian arms below); this type of mantle does not feature at all in British heraldry. The Swedish arms also feature an inescutcheon, a secondary escutcheon within the main one which represents (in this case) the monarch's dynasty, although they may also represent other things; the UK arms featured an inescutcheon from 1801, representing Hanover, until 1837, when it was removed. The UK's arms feature a helmet with mantling and crest which are absent from the Swedish arms. These features were all commonly used among the arms of European kingdoms. The lion (sometimes referred to as a leopard when depicted walking; not to be confused with the non-heraldic leopard), being a symbol of power and sovereignty, as well as of Jesus (the Lion of Judah), is a common charge on monarchal coats of arms and features on the coats of arms of all surviving European kingdoms (i.e. the coats of arms of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain (where it represents Le√≥n), Sweden, and the UK), as well as several former monarchies. There is much diversity in the coats of arms of the European republics. Many have chosen to use the same coat of arms they used as monarchies (or as part of monarchies) or a modified version of it. Finland for example uses the former coat of arms of the Grand Duke of Finland, a title held by the Swedish Monarch until 1809 and then by the Russian Emperor until 1917. Other examples include Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Estonia, all of which also feature lions. Like lions, eagles were common charges in the arms of many former European monarchies (although they do not feature on the arms of any surviving European monarchies). Double- headed eagles were also associated with imperial power (specifically that of the Byzantine, Holy Roman, Austrian, Serbian and Russian Empires). Single- headed eagles can be found today on the coats of arms of Poland, Germany, and Romania; double-headed eagles can be found on the coats of arms of Russia (without the ermine mantling and crown of the Russian Empire), Serbia, Montenegro, and Albania. Austria uses a single-headed eagle as a supporter for its coat of arms, but this is officially unrelated to and distinct from the double-headed eagle used by the former Austrian Empire; the escutcheon (gules, a fess argent) is however a pre-republic symbol dating back to the middle ages. Eagles also feature prominently as supporters on the coats of arms of Arab states, having been derived from the Eagle of Saladin. These include the coats of arms of Egypt, Iraq (see below) and Palestine, and formerly on the coats of arms of Libya, Yemen, and the United Arab Republic. Many former European colonies have chosen to use a heraldic coat of arms, but with no connection to the coat of arms used by the colonizing empires. Australia and Jamaica are examples of countries that have created such a modern coat of arms according to old heraldic principles. These two nations also have chosen not to use a crown on top of their coats of arms although they formally are monarchies (Australia, however, does use St Edward's Crown within the coat of arms, on the parts representing Queensland and Victoria). The coat of arms of Uganda below is a typical example of an African coat of arms, with a tribal shield supported by native animals. Often, a country will employ different versions of their coats of arms for different purposes. For example, many have a heavily simplified \\"lesser\\" version of their arms, with the full or \\"greater\\" version being restricted for use by the monarch or in other specific circumstances.

Another common type of national coat of arms is the seal. Originally, a seal was used for authenticating documents by stamping an impression on documents and the like. These seals would often contain coats of arms. The United States adopted a seal whose graphical design would also be used as a state symbol and not only as impressions on state documents. This is common in the Americas but also around the world. The round form with text saying what it stands for is easy to recognise. Many national seals are actually, to some extent, in part heraldic and can even have set colours which are always used, even if a seal has another use originally - as a stamp in wax - and in this sense formally never has colours.

The forms followed a very common pattern and since these national emblems were used in the same way as traditional heraldic coats of arms, even if they did not follow the rules of heraldry, they have been called \\"socialist heraldry\\". Many of them incorporated symbols of industry and agriculture, the hammer and sickle, a raising sun and the red star of communism. It was not uncommon to show landscapes and weapons, as can be seen in the examples below. When giving up communism, most of these countries returned to traditional heraldry ‚Äì see for instance the coat of arms of Bulgaria, coat of arms of Georgia, coat of arms of Hungary, and coat of arms of Romania. The designs of socialist heraldry also influenced some non-socialist states, such as Italy.

Only prototypes were produced.Purdy, Don: AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition, page 190. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. The concept of a higher- powered Lancair IV derivative was finally filled by the Lancair Propjet. Design and development The Tigress was intended to be a development of the Lancair IV adapted to employ the Orenda OE600 V-8 engine, giving it a cruise speed of . To accept the higher power and the increased speeds the airframe was structurally strengthened. The engine was later cancelled by its manufacturer, Orenda Aerospace, and the Tigress kit was not produced as a result. The aircraft featured a cantilever low-wing, a four-seat pressurized cabin, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The Tigress was made from composites, including graphite fiber. Its span was shorter than that used on the Lancair IV, mounted flaps and had a wing area of . The Tigress's wing used a McWilliams RXM5-217 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a NACA 64-212 at the wing tip, the same as employed on the Lancair IV.

Glimcher (born November 3, 1961) is an American neuroeconomist, neuroscientist, psychologist, economist, scholar, and entrepreneur. He is one of the foremost researchers focused on the study of human behavior and decision-making, and is known for his central role in founding and developing the field of neuroeconomics which takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding how humans make decisions. Glimcher also founded the Institute for the Study of Decision Making at New York University, which he currently directs. Glimcher holds the Julius Silver, Rosyln S. Silver and Enid Silver Winslow Chair of Neural Science at New York University (NYU) in the School of Arts and Sciences where he also holds professorial appointments in Economics and Psychology, and in Neuroscience and Physiology in NYU's School of Medicine. He is also the founder of the HUMAN Project, a large-scale interdisciplinary longitudinal study, and Datacubed Health, a start-up company focused on developing and marketing new Software-as-a-Service (PaaS) technologies in the healthcare industry and biomedical/behavioral research domain. In addition to the many books and scholarly papers he's written in the field of neuroeconomics, he is the lead editor of the textbook, Neuroeconomics: Decision-Making and the Brain, now in its second edition. Early life and education Paul W. Glimcher was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Arne and Mildred Glimcher. His father, Arne Glimcher, was the founder of the renowned New York City-based Pace Gallery, the second largest private art gallery in the world. Not as artistically inclined as his father and the family business, Paul Glimcher was always interested in science and technology from an early age. Growing up in New York City, Glimcher attended the prestigious Dalton School in Manhattan. In 1983 Glimcher received an A.B. magna cum laude in neuroscience from Princeton University. In 1989 he received a Ph.D. degree in neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania, studying under the American psychologist, C. Randy Gallistel. Glimcher's was the first doctoral degree in neuroscience awarded by the University of Pennsylvania. Glimcher's post-doctoral training was in oculomotor physiology. Working with Professor David Sparks (University of Pennsylvania) researching the brainstem and mesencephalic nuclei that control eye rotations, Glimcher uncovered evidence that structures participating in the execution of saccadic eye movements might be involved in planning those movements as well. Glimcher's earlier work focused on the identification and characterization of signals that intervene between the neural processes that engage in sensory encoding and the neural processes that engage in movement generation, which underlie decision-making. Since that time, his methodologies have broadened to include techniques from experimental economics, behavioral economics, econometrics, and brain imaging, most notably pioneering the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for behavioral research. His work has pioneered the notion of subjective value, which is widely identified as the neurobiological correlate of economic utility. Career and Role in Founding Neuroeconomics In 1994, Glimcher began work as an Assistant Professor in Neural Science at New York University. In 2001 he was promoted to Associate Professor of Neural Science and Psychology. In 2004, he founded the Center for Neuroeconomics at New York University, one of the first research centers ever dedicated to the field.Adler, Jerry. \\"Mind Reading\\". Newsweek. 5 July 2004:44-47. Print In 2006, Glimcher became an Associate Professor in Economics in addition to his postings in neural science and psychology, and in 2008 was promoted to full Professor of Neural Science, Economics, and Psychology. In 2010, Glimcher became the Silver Endowed Chair in Neural Science. In March 2014 the Center for Neuroeconomics became the Institute for the Study of Decision Making, reporting directly to NYU's Provost. The field of neuroeconomics began to develop in the late 1990s as a natural out-growth of the maturation of many different disciplines‚Äì‚Äìsuch as neuroscience, psychology, and economics‚Äì‚Äìhappening all at once. Glimcher was instrumental in facilitating the development of the bourgeoning of the field by recognizing these trends and understanding that future groundbreaking behavioral science research would require an interdisciplinary approach to overcome the inherent research limitations of any one discipline.Rangel, A. (2011) How does the brain make economic decisions? Trends in Cognitive Sciences. 15:3.95-96. He co-authored what is often referred to as the first academic paper in neuroeconomics, with American neurobiologist, Michael Platt, which was published in the journal Nature in 1999.Platt, M.L. and Glimcher, P.W. (1999) Neural correlates of decision variables in parietal cortex. Nature. 400: 233-238 His first book, Decisions, Uncertainty and the Brain: The Science of Neuroeconomics (MIT Press) was published in 2003 and is often identified as the first book to use the word Neuroeconomics. That book won the PROSE Award for Best Medical Science Book of 2003. In 2004, he founded the Center for Neuroeconomics at NYU‚Äì‚Äìthe first such research entity devoted to the field‚Äì‚Äìwhile also serving as the founding president of the Society for Neuroeconomics. The Center for Neuroeconomics became the Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of Decision Making in 2014 and Institute for the Study of Decision Making in 2017. In 2009 he served as lead editor along with Colin Camerer, Ernst Fehr, and Russell Poldrack of the first textbook dedicated to the discipline of neuroeconomics: Neuroeconomics Decision-Making and the Brain (2008, Elsevier). That book won the 2009 PROSE Award for Excellence in the [Economic and] Social Sciences. In 2011 he published Foundations of Neuroeconomic Analysis (2011, Oxford) and, in 2014 with Ernst Fehr, completed a second edition of this textbook. The HUMAN Project After starting up the Institute for the Study of Decision Making in 2014, Glimcher‚Äì‚Äìworking with Miyoung Chun of The Kavli Foundation‚Äì‚Äìalso began the development of a new interdisciplinary longitudinal study sponsored by The Kavli Foundation, called the Kavli HUMAN Project. One of his signature achievements, the Kavli HUMAN Project is a ‚Äúbig human data‚Äù research platform that took its inspiration from big data surveys in other disciplines, in particular the astronomy community's Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey will study tens of thousands of Americans for decades, much like past longitudinal studies‚Äì‚Äìsuch as the Framingham Heart Study‚Äì‚Äìexcept that the scope of measurements and disciplines covered by The HUMAN Project eclipse any past biomedical or behavioral research longitudinal study. Datacubed Health LLC In 2016, in light of governmental fiscal austerity for basic research at all levels, Glimcher founded Human Project Inc., then an NYU incubator company established to develop the foundational technologies used by The HUMAN Project and commercialize those technologies to generate revenue which can in turn sustain the long-term operation of The HUMAN Project, whose funding is supplemented by limited Federal and philanthropic funding. Now called Datacubed Healthcare, its product is a Software-as-a- Service (SaaS), which can enable new methods of: data analytics for large- scale datasets; conducting clinical or basic biomedical/behavioral research; and recruiting and retaining human research subjects. Today Datacubed health sells its product to Pharma and CROs. Glimcher is currently the CSO of Datacubed Health. Research Glimcher's research aims to describe the neural events that underlie behavioral decision-making using tools from neuroscience, psychology, and economics. His research merges psychological and economic models with computational neuroscience, including pioneering uses of fMRI (function magnetic resonance imaging) for behavioral science, to understand how value is encoded in the brain and how the brain uses those neural representations of value to guide decision-making; for example, how the brain carries out delay discounting or action-selection in the face of both risk and ambiguity. His laboratory in NYU's Center for Neural Science uses a wide range of methods including cohort studies in experimental economics, brain imaging, and single-neuron studies in non-human animals.Glimcher, Paul.

Journal of Neurophysiology. 103(2):1036-47 His most notable contributions are in: the development of the field of neuroeconomics; studies of dopamine and reinforcement learning; elucidating the neurobiological basis of human preferences; how people make intertemporal choices; and pioneering the application of ‚Äúnormalized representation‚Äù to decision-making. In 1999, with neuroscientist, Michael Platt, Glimcher was the first to demonstrate a utility-like value signal in the brain of a living creature. This finding appeared in the peer reviewed journal Nature. In 2004, with Michael Dorris, he published the first experimental test of the hypothesis that the Nash Equilibrium in strategic games specifies an internal representation of value in the peer-reviewed journal Neuron.Dorris, M.C. and Glimcher, P.W. (2004) Activity in Posterior Parietal Cortex is Correlated with the Subjective Desirability of an Action. Neuron. 44: 365-378. They found that, as hypothesized by Nash, mixed strategy equilibria emerge when the subject values of options being mixed are equivalent. Glimcher's laboratory has conducted extensive research on the brain's reward system, in particular the dopamine system and reinforcement learning. In 2005, with Hannah Bayer, he published the first quantitative test of the Dopamine Reward Prediction Error Hypothesis based on single neuron recordings from dopamine neurons and a novel kernel- based analysis in Neuron.Bayer, H.M. and Glimcher, P.W. (2005) Midbrain Dopamine Neurons Encode a Quantitative Reward Prediction Error Signal. Neuron. 47: 129-141. In 2007 Glimcher and Joe Kable were the first to demonstrate a clear subject value signal in the human brain that could be effectively disassociated from objective value signals. This finding was published in Nature Neuroscience.Kable, J.W., and Glimcher, P.W. (2007). The neural correlates of subjective value during intertemporal choice. Nat Neuroscience. 10(12): 1625 - 1633. In 2010, with Andrew Caplin, Mark Dean and Robb Rutledge, he published the first example of an axiomatic economic analysis applied to the neurobiology of decision-making in The Quarterly Journal of Economics.Caplin, A., Dean, M., Glimcher, P.W., & Rutledge, R.B. (2010). Measuring beliefs and rewards: A neuroeconomic approach. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 125(3): 923-960 This paper was also the first in a first-tier economic journal to include images of brain scans. In 2011, with Ifat levy, Stephanie Lazzaro and Robb Rutledge, he published the first demonstration that activity patterns in the human medial prefrontal cortex, measured in the absence of choice behavior, could be used to predict later choices by the same individuals in the Journal of Neuroscience.Levy, I., Lazzaro, S., Rutledge, R.B., & Glimcher, P.W. (2011). Choice from non-choice: Predicting consumer preferences from blood oxygenation level-dependent signals obtained during passive viewing. Journal of Neuroscience, 31(1): 118-125 In 2013, with Kenway Louie and Mel Win Khaw, he demonstrated that efficient compressive encoding of subjective value by neurons in the brains of monkeys predicts novel anomalies in choice behavior which they subsequently observed in both monkeys and humans. These findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Louie, K., Khaw, M.W., & Glimcher, P.W. (2013). Normalization is a general neural mechanism for context-dependent decision making. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 110: 6129-6144. In 2016, Glimcher and co- authors explained how a preexisting survey-based methodology for valuing public environmental goods (e.g. public parks)‚Äì‚Äì‚ÄúContingent Valuation‚Äù‚Äì‚Äìcould be refined with a neuroeconomical approach. Glimcher et al. incorporated fMRI measurements to contrast with the outputs of traditional contingent valuation. Their research showed that the way people value environmental public goods differs on a neurobiological level from ‚Äúneural activity associated with previously examined goods and preference measures‚Äù. In other words, people value environmental goods differently from other tangible goods, like food or clothing. While further research is required in this line of inquiry, the research could influence public policy and how scientists communicate with the public about dangers posed to the environment and/or shared resources. Overall, Glimcher's research has appeared in academic journals in the fields of economics, psychology, neuroscience, as well as in general scholarly journals such as Nature, Science, and the Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences. He has published nearly 100 academic articles with colleagues, postdoctoral fellows, and students. The Kavli HUMAN Project is Glimcher's signature research project, combining almost all of the elements of his research over the past three decades.

The Cross was awarded to officers, NCOs and men of the Baltic Landeswehr and voluntary groups who had fought in the Baltic states during 1918‚Äì19 for at least three months against the Bolshevik armies. Ceremonies are known from July 1919. The Baltic National Committee in Jelgava, in Courland (now in Latvia) issued numbered warrants for the award. A total of 21,839 Baltic Crosses were awarded. The Cross was accepted as a state-approved decoration of the German Reich on 16 May 1933 and was allowed to be worn. State approval was continued by the Federal Republic of Germany. The Baltic Cross is a black oxydised metal cross superimposed with a gilt cross of the coat of arms of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, ending in fleurs de lys; the reverse is plain. The ribbon is in the blue and white colours of the Baltic countries' defence. The design was established by members of the Baltic National Committee.

Hubbard served as chief of the Enemy Order of Battle Section in the G2 Military Intelligence Division and then as a liaison to the Allied Forces' headquarters for General John Pershing. He also served as director of the military intelligence school in Langres, France at the end of the war. Recognizing these efforts, the U.S. Army awarded Hubbard their Distinguished Service Medal,Valor Awards for Samuel T. Hubbard and France awarded him their Officier d'Acad√©mie Medal. Returning to the U.S., Hubbard worked as an executive with Hubbard Brothers & Company (HBC), a cotton grower launched by his family members. Representing HBC, he served as vice president and then as president of the New York Cotton Exchange, \\"New York Cotton Exchange chose Samuel T. Hubbard Jr., to be president another term.\\" the oldest commodity exchange in New York City. Early life and education Hubbard was born in the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey on July 7, 1884, to Samuel T. Hubbard and Elizabeth Van Winkle Hubbard. Like his son, Hubbard's father also served as president of the New York Cotton Exchange (1900‚Äì1902). Hubbard graduated from Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey in 1903. He earned his bachelor's degree at Harvard University in 1907. Military career Hubbard enlisted as a private with the New York Army National Guard in 1911. At the outbreak of World War I, he received a commission in the Signal Officers Reserve Corps. General Pershing appointed him as chief of the Order of Battle Section in the G2 Military Intelligence Division in July 1917. The following year, Hubbard received a promotion to major and liaison officer. Following the war, Hubbard served with the headquarters of the Army of Occupation in Coblenz, Germany. He also gave an invited talk to the 7th Infantry Regiment about his experiences serving in military intelligence. Memoirs of a Staff Officer Hubbard described his lessons learned in military intelligence in a book he penned, Memoirs of a Staff Officer: 1917‚Äì1919. Since its 1959 publication, this book has greatly influenced historical examinations of American military intelligence.

Short & Company in Helena, Arkansas to work as a checker in their cotton classing room and a book keeper. He then worked as a cotton purchaser for the firm. In 1909, Hubbard joined his family's cotton business, Hubbard Brothers & Company. He served as officer manager of their Fall River, Massachusetts office and then as office manager of the New York City office. After Hubbard Brothers & Company liquidated in 1928, Hubbard joined Goodbody & Co., one of the largest stockbrokerage firms, as their cotton and commodity partner. He served in that role for 28 years. Hubbard also served as a member of the Chicago Board of Trade. Representing the New York Cotton Exchange, Hubbard testified before Congressional hearings on declining cotton prices in 1926 and 1928. He also testified at the 1936 Congressional hearing on declining cotton prices. Speaking at this hearing, Hubbard advocated for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate the cotton commodity market.

According to E. H. H. Green, the Committee \\"saw the earliest, detailed discussion of Conservative principles concerning the role of the State in the provision of social welfare\\".Green, p. 6. Arthur Steel-Maitland was elected to parliament as a Conservative in January 1910 and in October he sought to bring together Conservative social reformers into a committee. However, this was postponed by the general election of December. The Committee held its first meeting in February 1911.Green, pp. 74-75. Green stated that Steel-Maitland was \\"very much the driving force behind the USRC, which under his aegis had become an official party think-tank of Conservative politicians and intellectuals dedicated to formulating Conservative social policy\\".Green, p. 75. In September 1913 the Committee called for rural wage boards, appointed by County Councils and would, if necessary, enforce a minimum wage. This divided the party and party leader Bonar Law attempted to postpone a decision by telling the party conference in November that an inquiry would be set up looking at the proposals. Infighting continued, however, with Lord Salisbury emerging as one of the foremost opponents of regulating rural wages. He wrote to Steel- Maitland, claiming that a minimum wage should be enforced locally not nationally and should be voluntary, claiming that it would cause unemployment. Steel-Maitland in reply argued that as demand for rural labour exceeded supply, there was no danger of unemployment and that a voluntary minimum wage would not bring underpaying farmers into line.Green, pp. 88-89. In the Committee's 1914 book, Industrial Unrest, they argued: > We have in this country now outlived that curious philosophic conception of > the relations between the State and the individual which finds its origins > in Rousseau and its most powerful exponents on this side of the channel in > Bentham, the two Mills, Herbert Spencer and Cobden...[and that] the old > Cobdenite and laissez faire view that the conditions of wages, health, > housing and labour among the vast majority of the population of this country > was the concern of private individuals and private contract has long since > been abandoned.Green, p. 251. At the outbreak of war in 1914, the Committee was in the middle of an in-depth study on the provision of health care.Green, p. 6. In an undated paper titled ‚ÄòThe Theory of Public Health‚Äô, the Committee noted that \\"The boundary between private and the official sphere is constantly changing and sometimes eludes precise definition...[it is] true that the voluntary association of individuals here and there intercepts the necessity for public action...that does not affect the general proposition that the care and improvement of its subjects' health must occupy a large place in the outlook of every modern and civilised government\\".Green, p. 269, n. 147.

Conformational ensembles, also known as structural ensembles are experimentally constrained computational models describing the structure of intrinsically unstructured proteins. Such proteins are flexible in nature, lacking a stable tertiary structure, and therefore cannot be described with a single structural representation. The techniques of ensemble calculation are relatively new on the field of structural biology, and are still facing certain limitations that need to be addressed before it will become comparable to classical structural description methods such as biological macromolecular crystallography.  Purpose  Ensembles are models consisting of a set of conformations that together attempt to describe the structure of a flexible protein. Even though the degree of conformational freedom is extremely high, flexible/disordered protein generally differ from fully random coil structures. The main purpose of these models is to gain insights regarding the function of the flexible protein, extending the structure-function paradigm from folded proteins to intrinsically disordered proteins.  Calculation techniques  The calculation of ensembles rely on experimental measurements, mostly by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and Small-angle X-ray scattering. These measurements yield short and long-range structural information. = Short- range = * Chemical Shifts (CS) * Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs) * J-couplings * Hydrogen-exchange * Solvent-accessibility. = Long-range = * Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancements (PREs) * Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) * SAXS topological restraints. = Constrained molecular dynamics simulations = The structure of disordered proteins may be approximated by running constrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations where the conformational sampling is being influenced by experimentally derived constraints. = Fitting experimental data = Another approach uses selection algorithms such as ENSEMBLE and ASTEROIDS. Calculation procedures first generate a pool of random conformers (initial pool) so that they sufficiently sample the conformation space. The selection algorithms start by choosing a smaller set of conformers (an ensemble) from the initial pool. Experimental parameters (NMR/SAXS) are calculated (usually by some theoretical prediction methods) for each conformer of chosen ensemble and averaged over ensemble. The difference between these calculated parameters and true experimental parameters is used to make an error function and the algorithm selects the final ensemble so that the error function is minimised.  Limitations  The determination of a structural ensemble for an IDP from NMR/SAXS experimental parameters involves generation of structures that agree with the parameters and their respective weights in the ensemble. Usually, the available experimental data is less compared to the number of variables required to determine making it an under-determined system. Due to this reason, several structurally very different ensembles may describe the experimental data equally well, and currently there are no exact methods to discriminate between ensembles of equally good fit. This problem has to be solved either by bringing in more experimental data or by improving the prediction methods by introducing rigorous computational methods.

Since 1887, it has been part of the British Museum's collection.British Museum Collection Discovery The brightly painted sarcophagus of the Etruscan aristocratic woman Seianti was discovered in 1886 at Poggio Cantarello near Chiusi in Tuscany and was subsequently sold, along with its contents (a skeleton and some grave belongings), to the British Museum. A similar sarcophagus is in the collections of the National Archaeological Museum in Florence. Known as the Sarchophagus of Larthia Seianti, the two women were probably from the same dynastic family in ancient Chiusi. Description The sarcophagus is a masterpiece of Etruscan artwork. The deceased woman's name is inscribed in Etruscan along the base of the chest. She must have belonged to one of the richest families of Chiusi, as Seianti is dressed sumptuously for the occasion, wearing an ornate gown and cloak, with complicated drapery falling sinuously over her body, and adorned with a tiara, earrings, bracelets and a necklace. Seianti has been depicted as a mature lady, who gestures to adjust her veil, realistically revealing parts of her body in the process. She leans against a pillow and holds a mirror in her other hand, gazing into the distance. Scientific analysis Scientific analysis of the bones and teeth that were deposited in the chest indicated that Seianti probably died at about 50‚Äì55 years of age. The rather idealised face of the deceased woman depicted on the sarcophagus, which was typical of Etruscan art at the time, can be compared with an accurate and less flattering reconstruction of her face in the museum, based on the features of the deceased woman's skull.

It is also spelled Lai according to the Cantonese pronunciation. It is listed 247th in the Song Dynasty classic text Hundred Family Surnames. Relatively uncommon, Li Âé≤ is not among the top 300 surnames in China. People with the surname are concentrated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Hunan provinces of China. According to tradition, the Li Âé≤ surname originated from Duke Li of Qi of ninth century BC, and the Zhou Dynasty state of Li Âé≤. The oldest extant genealogy book of the Li surname dates from the early fourth century AD.  Origins  According to traditional accounts, there are two ancient origins of the Li Âé≤ surname: 1\\\\. From Duke Li of Qi: Wuji, the ruler of the State of Qi during the Western Zhou Dynasty, was killed in a rebellion in 816 BC. After his death, he was given the posthumous title Li, which was adopted by his descendants as their surname. As Duke Li's ancestral name was Jiang (Âßú), this branch originated from the Jiang surname. 2\\\\. From the minor state of Li Âé≤ during the Zhou Dynasty: Li was located at modern Li Township (Âéâ‰π°) in Sui County, Hubei province. The state was conquered by Chu, a major power of the time. The people of Li adopted the name of their state as their surname.  Later adoptions  As the character Âé≤/Âéâ, meaning \\"strict\\" or \\"severe\\", has negative connotations, it was sometimes given to people as a form of punishment. During the Three Kingdoms period, General Sun Xi√π (Â≠ôÁßÄ), a cousin of Emperor Sun Hao of Eastern Wu, defected to Eastern Wu's enemy Jin. As punishment, Sun Hao forbade Sun Xiu's descendants to use the royal surname and changed their surname to Li. During the Tang Dynasty, Prince Li Jin (ÊùéÊôã), a member of the extended royal family, plotted a rebellion together with Princess Taiping, and was executed after the plot failed. After Emperor Xuanzong ascended the throne, he ordered Li Jin's family members to change their surname from the royal name of L«ê Êùé to L√¨ Âé≤. Migration and distribution Qing Dynasty poet and scholar Li E The Li surname is concentrated in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Hunan. Among the extant genealogy books of the Li surname, the one from the Li clan of Dongyang, Zhejiang is the oldest, dating from the Yongjia era (307‚Äì313 AD) of Western Jin. During the Disaster of Yongjia, when northern China was overrun by the Wu Hu nomads, Li Leifu (ÂéâÈõ∑Áî´) fled from Xinye, Henan south to Jinhua, and his descendants subsequently moved to nearby Dongyang. From there they prospered and spread all over Zhejiang province, establishing sublineages in Cixi, Yuyao, Yongkang, Wenzhou, and Zhoushan. The Qing Dynasty poet and scholar Li E was a member of the Cixi sublineage. There are several Li clans in Jiangsu province. The Danyang Li clan is said to have descended from Li Wen (ÂéâÊ∏©), the Marquis of Yiyang (‰πâÈò≥‰æØ) during the Han Dynasty. His descendant Li Jie (Âéâ‰ªã) migrated south to Danyang when the Jurchen Jin dynasty overran much of northern China in the 12th century. During the Ming Dynasty, Li Guohua (ÂéâÂõΩÂçé) from the Danyang Li clan served as the governor of Fujian province.

Li Ê†ó is the 249th most common surname in China, with a total population of about 300,000, half of whom live in Henan province. Origins According to traditional accounts, the surname Li Ê†ó originates from the legendary tribe or state called Lilu (), and the historical state of Li, which has been linked to Lilu. In the third-century text Records of Emperors and Kings (), Huangfu Mi records the legend that goddess N√ºwa enfeoffed thirteen tribes or states, all having the Feng (È£é) surname. Lilu was ranked the fourth among the thirteen. Professor Li Yujie of Henan University believes that Lilu was likely the first people in China to cultivate chestnuts (the character li Ê†ó also means chestnut). During the Shang Dynasty, the state of Li () existed in what is now Xiayi County, Shangqiu, Henan province. After the state was conquered by the Zhou Dynasty, its people adopted the name of their former state as their surname. The surname thus has a history of approximately 3,100 years. The Li capital (called Licheng or Li City), now submerged under the Tianlong Lake southwest of the county seat of Xiayi, is a protected site of Shangqiu.

It is one of the most common surnames in the world, shared by 92.76 million people in China, and more than 100 million worldwide. It is the fourth name listed in the Song dynasty classic text Hundred Family Surnames. The name is pronounced as \\"Lei\\" in Cantonese, but is often spelled as Lee in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and many other overseas Chinese communities. In Macau, it is also spelled as Lei. In Indonesia it is commonly spelled as Lie. The common Korean surname, Lee (also romanized as Yi, Ri, or Rhee), and the Vietnamese surname, L√Ω, are both derived from Li and are historically written with the same Chinese character (Êùé). The character also means \\"plum\\" or \\"plum tree\\". Demographics and distribution Li Êùé is one of the most common surnames in China and the world, shared by more than 93 million people in China, or about 7.4% of the Chinese population. Worldwide, more than 100 million people bear the surname. It was formerly thought to be the most common surname in China, but a 2013 analysis of the names of 1.33 billion Chinese citizens has concluded that Li is the second most common surname, behind Wang with 95 million people. In 2019 it was again the second most common surname in Mainland China.http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/20/676822.html Li Êùé is the most common surname for the Hakka people. Geographically, Li is one of the most common surnames in North China and Southwest China. In 2019 Li was the most common surname in Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, Hubei and Hunan.http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/20/676822.html In provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Yunnan, more than 8.8% of the local population are surnamed Li. Among all Chinese provinces, Henan has the largest number of Li, accounting for 10.3% of the total. Li is less common in southern and southeastern China. Comparatively speaking, in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hainan, as well as Taiwan, only 2.2 to 6.6% of the population share the surname. Origins According to tradition, the Li surname originated from the title Dali held by Gao Yao, a legendary minister of the Xia dynasty, and was originally written with the different character (ÁêÜ). There is a claim that Laozi, the founder of Daoism, was Li Er. Li Er is the first historical person known to have the surname Li and is regarded as the founding ancestor of the surname. =Gao Yao= According to the ninth- century Tang dynasty text Yuanhe Xing Zuan, Li is a branch of the ancient ancestral name Ying (Â¨¥) and descends from Emperor Zhuanxu, grandson of the mythical Yellow Emperor. During the reign of Emperor Yao, Zhuanxu's descendant Gao Yao served as Dali (Â§ßÁêÜ), or Minister of Law. During the Xia dynasty, Gao Yao's descendants adopted Li (ÁêÜ) as their surname, from the title Dali (meaning \\"great judge\\"). It is uncertain how the character for Li changed from the original ÁêÜ to the current Êùé. According to popular folklore, at the end of the Shang dynasty, the minister Li Zheng (ÁêÜÂæÅ) was executed by King Zhou of Shang who was known for his cruelty. Li Zheng's son Li Lizhen (ÁêÜÂà©Ë¥û) escaped with his mother to the ruins of Yihou (‰ºä‰æØ‰πãÂ¢ü), where they survived by eating plums. In gratitude, Li Lizhen changed his surname to Êùé, a character that means \\"plum\\" and is a homophone of ÁêÜ. Li Lizhen was said to have settled at Ku County (Ëã¶Âéø), in modern Luyi County, Henan province, which is regarded as the original hometown of the Li surname. =Laozi= The first historical person known to have the surname is Li Er (ÊùéËÄ≥), better known as Laozi (fl. 6th century BC), the philosopher who founded Taoism. He was said to have been an eleventh-generation descendant of Li Lizhen. Laozi is widely revered as the founding ancestor of the Li surname. =Ba people= Another early origin of Li is the non-Huaxia Ba people, who established the Ba state during the Zhou dynasty in modern western Hubei province and Chongqing municipality. In 316 BC, Ba was conquered by the state of Qin, which would eventually conquer all the warring states to establish the Qin dynasty. Many Ba people adopted Li as their surname, as it sounded similar to the Ba word for tiger, which was a totem for the Ba. In 304 AD, the Ba leader Li Xiong (Emperor Wu) established Cheng Han, the first Li-surnamed dynasty in history. Tang dynasty Li Yuan (Emperor Gaozu), founder of the Tang dynasty As the surname of the emperors of the Tang dynasty, Li was bestowed upon or adopted by numerous people. During the period, it became one of the most common Chinese surnames. Li was the imperial surname of the Tang dynasty, founded by Li Yuan in 618 AD. One of the most prosperous and influential dynasties in Chinese history, Tang was ruled by 20 emperors surnamed Li. The Tang dynasty imperial family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from Laozi, Latourette 1934, p. 191. the Qin general Li Xin, the Han dynasty general Li Guang, and Western Liang ruler Li Gao.Drompp 2005, p. 126.Mair & Steinhardt & Goldin 2005, p. 376. The Tang emperors liberally granted the royal surname to favoured generals, officials, and their clans, such as Xu Shiji, Du Fuwei, and Guo Zihe (ÈÉ≠Â≠êÂíå). Many non-Han people under Tang's rule were also granted the Li surname, including the Eastern Tujue khan Ashina Simo (Li Simo), Mohe leaders Li Duozuo and Li Jinxing (ÊùéË∞®Ë°å), Khitan leaders Li Guangbi and Li Jinzhong, and Goguryo general Li Zhengji. Some Tibetans, Uyghurs, Persians, and Jews were also granted the Li surname. The number of people surnamed Li skyrocketed during the Tang dynasty. Other dynasties ruled by Li families During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period following the fall of Tang in 907, the Shatuo general Li Keyong, who had been granted the Li surname, established the Jin State, precursor of the Later Tang. Li Bian (Xu Zhigao), the founder of the Southern Tang, also changed his surname to Li. The emperors of Later Tang and Southern Tang continued the Tang tradition of liberally bestowing the Li surname on their favoured people. Other Li-surnamed dynasties include Liang, Western Xia (Tangut Empire), and Shun. All told, there have been 64 Li-surnamed emperors in Chinese history, ruling all or part of China for 650 years. Adoption by non-Han Chinese peoples L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï, founder of the Vietnamese L√Ω dynasty Influenced by Chinese culture, many non-Han Chinese peoples living in and near China have adopted Chinese-style names throughout history, and Li is one of the most common surnames adopted. Li has been used by the Bai people for more than 1,000 years, and is one of the top three surnames among the Bai. Li is the fifth of the twelve most common surnames of the Yao people, who adopted the name more than 800 years ago. Li also has history of 500 years among the Miao people. Among the 55 officially recognized ethnic minorities in China, 33 are known to use the Li surname. Li (spelled L√Ω in modern Vietnamese) has been used in Vietnam for more than 2,000 years since the Han dynasty, when Northern Vietnam was ruled as a province of the Han Empire. In 544, Vietnam gained temporary independence from China when L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø founded the Early L√Ω dynasty. L√Ω Nam ƒê·∫ø (Li Nan Di), as an ethnic Chinese, ruled as an emperor of Vietnam. In 1009, L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï established the Later L√Ω dynasty, which ruled Vietnam for more than 200 years. In 1232, after the L√Ω dynasty was replaced by the Tr·∫ßn dynasty, Grand Preceptor Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô made some descendants of the L√Ω family change their surname to Nguy·ªÖn. The Koreans began using Chinese surnames en masse during the Sui dynasty (ruled by the Yang family), which was then usurped by the Tang dynasty. Today, Li (romanized as Lee, Yi, or Rhee in Korea) is one of the top four Korean surnames. In 1392, Yi Seong-gye established the Joseon dynasty, which ruled Korea for around 500 years. Prominent clans There are historically twelve prominent clans (junwang, ÈÉ°Êúõ) of Li, the most famous being those of the Longxi and Zhao commanderies. The Zhao clan, based in modern Hebei's Zhao County, traces its origin from Li Mu (died 229 BC), Lord Wu'an of the State of Zhao, a general of the Warring States period. The Zhao clan produced 17 prime ministers during the Tang dynasty. In 2010, a group of nine large tombs of the Zhao clan were discovered in Zanhuang County, dating from the Northern Dynasties. The Zhao clan remained the most prominent branch of the Li until it was surpassed by the Longxi during the Tang dynasty. The Longxi clan is named after the Longxi Commandery in southern Gansu province. Li Chong (ÊùéÂ¥á), the first Qin governor of Longxi, is revered as its founder. The Han general Li Guang, famous for defeating the Xiongnu, came from Longxi. Centuries later, the Tang emperors traced their ancestry to the Longxi clan, making it the most prominent branch ever since. The Longxi Li is considered one of the four great cultural traditions of Gansu province. Longxi County has built a museum for the Li clan, and hosted the Longxi Li cultural festival in 2012. There are 2,157 genealogy books of Li families known to be extant. Historical distribution and migration \\"World Headquarter of the Lee's Family\\", Taipei, Taiwan Having originated in what is now Henan province, Li has spread to Shanxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei provinces by the end of the Warring States period. During the Qin dynasty, the Lis spread to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, while Li Chong established the Longxi Li clan in Gansu. During the early Tang dynasty many Lis migrated to Fujian and Hainan provinces. After the mass adoption of the imperial Li surname during the Tang period, Li became the second most common surname during the subsequent Song dynasty, after Wang. There were approximately 5.6 million people with the surname, or 7.2% of the total population at the time, with large concentrations in the northern provinces of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong. The Mongol invasion of China in the 13th century caused widespread depopulation in northern China. Li, being overrepresented in the north, was hit especially hard. In the Ming dynasty following the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the Li-surnamed population had declined to 5.1 million, constituting 5.5% of the total population. It fell behind Zhang to become the third most common surname of the time. Many of the Lis had migrated to South China by this period.

Unlike ‚Äúrespite‚Äù for caregivers, ‚Äúmedical respite‚Äù is short-term residential care that allows homeless individuals the opportunity to rest in a safe environment while accessing medical care and other supportive services. Medical respite programs provide hospitals with an alternative to discharging homeless patients to the streets or to unequipped shelters when patients would otherwise be discharged to their homes for self- care and recuperation. In addition to providing post-acute care and clinical oversight, medical respite programs seek to improve transitional care for this population and end the cycle of homelessness by supporting patients in access benefits and housing. As of 2014, over 70 medical respite programs have been established across the United States and a number are in development. Medical respite programs are housed in a number of different facility types including homeless shelters, motel rooms, nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and stand-alone facilities. The largest facility is based out of Boston, Massachusetts (United States), called the Barbara McIinnis House, which has 104 beds for men and women in need of a safe place to recuperate after leaving a hospital. The national average length of stay in medical respite programs is 40 days (30 days median). Studies and discussion about medical respite care include works on an individual and program level. A study out of Chicago looking at the impact of medical respite care on future hospitalizations found that patients who accessed medical respite care required fewer hospital stays (3.7 vs. 8.3 days) in the 12-months after program participation than those discharged from the hospital to the street or shelter. Another study out of Boston found similar results with homeless patients requiring 50% fewer hospital readmissions in the 90-days following medical respite program participation than those released to their own care (the street or shelter). Medical respite care has been discussed in the American Medical New Ethics Forum. Medical respite care is listed as a strategy in the federal plan to prevent and end homelessness. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation is currently conducting a national demonstration program to assess the impact of medical respite care. The demonstration is supported by the Affordable Care Act as an effort to improve health outcomes and health care quality while reducing health care spending for this population. The National Health Care for the Homeless Council maintains a Respite Care Providers' Network of over 700 providers, consumers, and advocates who seek to improve access to medical respite care for homeless individuals across the country.

Two additional locomotives were obtained in 1901 from ALCO, one each from Brooks and Richmond. The Brooks locomotive (#17) was heavier (30.1 long tons adhesive weight) with attendant increase in tractive effort (18340 lbf), and had a larger grate (17 sq ft). This locomotive was very popular with crews. This locomotive was dumped on the Oamaru foreshore. The Richmond locomotive had less evaporative heating surface but included a superheater. Boiler pressure was lower (180 psi) and tractive effort was marginally lower. The locomotives were initially assigned to Dunedin to Christchurch expresses and were reassigned as newer power replaced them. The last assignment for the class was on the West Coast Region.

In 2015, a notable preseason allowed him to make the roster by beating out Tim Jennings. He was sidelined after Week 5 with a hamstring injury. On November 17, he was released to make room for cornerback Jacoby Glenn. On November 19, he was signed to the Bears' practice squad. He was released on November 23. = Dallas Cowboys (second stint) = On December 2, 2015, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys to the practice squad. With cornerback Orlando Scandrick out with a season ending knee injury and Tyler Patmon struggling, Mitchell was promoted to the active roster on December 18 and was named the team's nickel cornerback. In his first game against the New York Jets he registered a pass defensed and an interception, becoming one of two cornerbacks on the team to have an interception on the year. Against the Washington Redskins he sacked quarterback Colt McCoy, forcing a fumble. In three games, he registered 12 tackles, one sack, one interception and 2 passes defensed. In 2016, he was used at nickel back and safety during Organized Team Activities. He was released on June 10. Mitchell with the Chiefs in 2017 = Houston Texans = On June 13, 2016, Mitchell was claimed off waivers by the Houston Texans, to replace rookie cornerback Richard Leonard who suffered a torn hamstring.

He was released on November 8, 2016 and signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted back to the active roster on November 25, to be the third cornerback. In 2017, he began the season as a starter at right cornerback for seven games in place of an injured Steven Nelson. In Week 3, he recorded two interceptions and nine tackles in a 24‚Äì10 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. His performance against the Chargers was the first multi-interception game of his professional career. On October 30, Nelson was activated to play against the Denver Broncos and Mitchell returned to a backup role behind Kenneth Acker. He finished with 9 starts out of 15 appearances and 4 interceptions. =Cleveland Browns= On March 15, 2018, Mitchell signed a three-year, $12 million contract with the Cleveland Browns, reuniting with John Dorsey who was the general manager with the Chiefs.

Henry (born 1945, in Canton, Ohio) is a retired television news anchor whose career spanned 44 years in the Northeast Ohio area, most notably as the primary news anchor on Cleveland ABC affiliate WEWS channel 5. Bio=Early life= Henry was born during the baby boom generation in 1945 in Canton, Ohio, the son of a local hardware store owner and his wife. As a student at Central Catholic High School, Henry actually got his first job in broadcasting - recording a commercial for his father's hardware store (an ad Henry admits was \\"really bad\\"). Following graduating high school in 1963, Henry attended Walsh University (then Walsh College) and a year later transferred to Kent State University, studying telecommunications. He would graduate from KSU in 1968. After graduating college, Henry was in graduate school at Kent State University, and later at Cleveland State University. At one point in his early twenties Ted entered the Peace Corps, serving overseas for over two years in a tiny third world country village, Caazapa, in Paraguay. =Broadcast career= Shortly after college, Henry worked as a reporter and weather forecaster for Akron, Ohio TV station WAKR-TV 23, and upon returning home from his Peace Corps service, Henry then worked at sister stations WKBN AM 570 and WKBN-TV 27 in Youngstown, Ohio as a government reporter. In 1972, Henry came to Cleveland and began work at WEWS. First he served as the weekend weatherman (Henry would admit in later years that as he didn't have a background in weather reporting, he would use forecasts from a Detroit radio station to base his forecast off of). He would work his way up the ranks to reporter, 11 pm news show producer, then weekend news anchor, and in 1975 became the weeknight news anchor, serving in that post for 34 years until his retirement in 2009, working with 13 different co-anchors over that time frame. Henry would make numerous international trips during his WEWS career to cover stories, including to Germany to cover the fall of the Berlin Wall, to Rome to cover the death of Pope John Paul II, and six trips to Israel. =Retirement= Henry announced his retirement on April 23, 2009, and his final newscast was on May 20. In his retirement, Henry and his wife Jody have traveled abroad, filming freelance interviews with religious and spiritual leaders like Sathya Sai Baba.

Her memoir The Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network (Free Press, June 2012) is an account of her time as one of Facebook's first employees. While working at the social media company, her roles included working in customer support and international development, and being ghostwriter for CEO Mark Zuckerberg.http://books.simonandschuster.com/Boy-Kings/Katherine- Losse/9781451668254  Facebook (2005-2010)  Losse was hired by Facebook in 2005 as its 51st employee. At first, her job was primarily as a customer service representative. In her book, The Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network, she notes that most of her co-workers were white, male, and Ivy League graduates. She also discusses how, at the time, the main focus of the company was merely growth and scalability. In 2009, Mark Zuckerberg hired Losse as his ghost writer. Throughout her book, Losse gives an overview of the novel work environment at Facebook. From the beginning, she mentions that she believes she was originally hired due to \\"the fact that Johns Hopkins featured prominently on [her] resume\\". This is one of many examples of Facebook being a primarily Ivy League-run company. During her first years at Facebook, Losse spent time answering basic customer support questions, as well as handling groups that were potential bullies. While handling such cases, the question of \\"when something was hate speech, free speech, a political disagreement, or some combination thereof,\\" became difficult to distinguish. On the internet, blatantly rude or racist opinions seemed easier for some to express. She stresses how Facebook constantly pushed to be a fun-filled environment, not just an ordinary work company, but something different and unique. This led to expectations such as socializing during breaks and going to expensive summer houses. During her last year at Facebook, Losse ended up working as Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs personal ghost writer. She became his public voice online, until her identity was revealed by Gawker.  Works  Since publishing her memoir, Losse has contributed essays on technology and culture to publications such as the New York Times, The New Yorker, and Dissent magazine.http://www.katelosse.tv/writing/ One of these essays was a critique of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's book Lean In.http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/feminisms-tipping-point-who- wins-from-leaning-in After the critique appeared in Dissent magazine, Brandee Barker ‚Äî former head of Facebook public relations, and part of the Lean In publicity campaign ‚Äî messaged Losse, \\"There's a special place in hell for you.\\" Losse publicly posted a picture of the message, which was picked up by a number of media outlets. In 2014, Losse published her article \\"The Male Gazed\\" to Model View Culture, in which she discussed the nature of privacy on social networks and the power of information.  Feminist beliefs  Both Katherine Losse's works The Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network and her article \\"The Male Gazed\\" express her strong feminist values. She criticizes the use of social networks, such as Facebook, for essentially allowing stalking to happen over the web with relative ease. The main people being looked at on such social media websites are females, while the main people doing the looking are males. Losse argues that social media has become a tool to spy on people, and somehow, this has become the norm.

Essentially they were developments of the firm's previous batch of 4-6-0s' for NZR. Origin and design Due to an increase in traffic around the turn of the century, NZR obtained 47 4-6-0 locomotives to provide additional capacity. All were used in the South Island. The UC class were the last new 4-6-0's to be delivered, entering service between August and October 1901. They were briefly classified \\"U\\". Externally they were similar in appearance to Sharp Stewart's earlier UA class, but with a longer cylinder stroke and considerably higher boiler pressure (200 psi as opposed to 175 psi) they had a significantly higher tractive effort. All of the locomotives began service in the Christchurch area aside from two allocated to the Dunedin - Invercargill section. Service With the opening of the Otira Tunnel in 1923 all ten were gradually transferred to the West Coast of the South Island. Due to weight restrictions they were the most powerful mainline locomotives on the West Coast until the 1940s. In the late 1920s and 1930s seven locomotives were fitted with narrow firebox superheated boilers and lever type reverse controls in place of the original wheel and screw type. Other alterations included fitting sand domes and a new type of funnel. The remaining three locomotives were withdrawn by 1937. The superheated boilers on the UCs provided better performance and from the mid 1930s they saw considerably greater use than the Baldwin built UB class locomotives. They were still being used on passenger services as well as coal trains in the mid 1950s, however the arrival of more A Class locomotives in the 1950s (displaced by dieselisation in the North Island) allowed their withdrawal by 1959. Although none were initially preserved a number were dumped in rivers as erosion prevention measures, and two have been recovered for potential restoration. Preservation In March 2005, the newly formed Midland Rail Heritage Trust in conjunction with a family of private individuals salvaged the remains of UC 369 and UC 370 from the Grey River. The locomotives had fallen into the Grey River in 1997-98 during a period of bad weather; both were recovered with the remains of their tenders and are currently stored at the MRHT's Springfield depot pending completion of a workshop to restore them in. In 2008, the remains of UC 366 were recovered by then network operator ONTRACK during an exercise to remove as many of the locomotive remains dumped at Oamaru which were at risk of being lost due to deterioration of the dumpsite. The badly deteriorated remains of the UC were passed to the Oamaru Steam and Rail Restoration Society, who have placed it on display at their workshops along with another selection of salvaged locomotive parts.

The book discusses the trends and psychology of conspiracy theorists as well as the conspiracies themselves, and the harm they cause. Several of the conspiracy theories mentioned originate from the 9/11 Truth movement, whose proponents believe that the terrorist attacks on the 11th of September 2001 were an inside job executed by the American government, and from young-earth creationists, whose proponents hold that scientists are hiding information which would disprove evolution. Inspiration Collins was inspired to write the book after being involved in the birther movement, whose proponents claim that American president Barack Obama was born outside of the USA, and is therefore ineligible to be president of the United States of America. Collins worked to debunk many of the claims of the Birther movement, believing that people should focus on policy issues and not uninformed trivia. Reception The book was generally well received. Paula Cerni stated that \\"while Collins‚Äô arguments are often banal and many of his examples silly, his underlying message is spot-on. When he finally asks 'What‚Äôs the harm?' he rightly warns that uncritical thinking carries a high cost. Injury to people‚Äôs health can follow from dubious faith-based or alternative practices. Economic scams‚Äînew-age and old-age‚Äîexploit the gullible and uneducated. Most tragically, the failure to engage our critical powers wastes precious time and resources needed to fix our personal and collective lives.\\" Stephen Law, author of Believing Bullshit said \\"This highly readable and entertaining book is full of wonderful examples of BS.

Mackelvie established a perpetual memorial for himself in Auckland, New Zealand, by his endowment of that city with a valuable art collection selected by himself in Europe, and a rich bequest for the maintenance of a permanent gallery. To further this purpose the Municipal Corporation, in September 1891, resolved to erect a Mackelvie annexe to the handsome building, in which the Grey Literary Collection and the Auckland Free Public Library are placed. Mackelvie in early life was engaged as supercargo of a vessel during the Crimean War, and subsequently as purser on an Atlantic liner. Leaving the sea, he obtained an appointment in a large mercantile house in London, and was so engaged in 1865, when Dr. Campbell, desiring a partner to take charge of his business while he visited Europe, entered into an agreement with Mackelvie, who came to Auckland and assumed the direction of the business of Messrs. Brown, Campbell & Co. until 1870, when the partnership terminated by effluxion of time. During that short period, however, Mackelvie had amassed a fortune by means of judicious mining investments on the Thames goldfields. He returned to Europe a month or two after quitting his connection with Brown, Campbell & Co., and lived in retirement, employing a large part of his time in collecting the art treasures which he had resolved to bequeath to the city where his fortune was made. Many valuable paintings and sketches were forwarded to Auckland during his lifetime, and at his death, which took place on 4 June 1885, by the terms of his will, after providing for about ¬£35,000 legacies, in some of which the trustees have a reversionary interest, the balance of the estate was left in trust for the people of Auckland. The legacy, owing to the great depreciation in all kinds of property, is very much less than the testator no doubt intended, but, including the reversionary interest in legacies, the trustees hope the amount may not be far short of ¬£30,000, besides the valuable collection now in the Art Gallery. During his stay in the colony Mackelvie was director of the Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, and other companies.

His 2012 book The Things We Do and Why We Do Them argues for a pluralist account of actions and their explanations, and includes the controversial view that the reasons for which we act cannot in themselves explain why any action occurs. Since then he has published numerous articles defending the view that understanding others is not reducible to obtaining information about their 'mental contents' and that, consequently, no theory about the nature of such access can account for understanding others, which requires the sharing of behaviour.

Description Adelmidrol is the semisynthetic diethanolamide derivative of azelaic acid, and has a symmetrical chemical structure. It classed as an amide, and is similar to palmitoylethanolamide, the parent molecule in the ALIAmide class of drugs. ALIAmides are group of fatty acid derivatives with cannabimimetic properties which have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects and are thought to act by reducing mast cell activation. It is used extensively in Italy in veterinary medicine to treat skin inflammation. In 2015, it was found the compound also exerts anti-inflammatory action given systemically in 10 mg per kg bodyweight. In animal models Adelmidrol has been shown to negatively control the behavior of canine skin MCs during pathophysiological conditions (i.e. healing of experimental wounds). In particular, a statistically significant increase of intracytoplasmatic granular content of dermal MCs was shown in adelmidrol (2%)-treated wounds compared to control, thus suggesting the compound is effectively able to down- modulate skin MC degranulation in dogs. Chronic gingiva inflammation can be a difficult to treat medical problem in dogs. A similar anti-inflammatory effect was observed in these dogs, treated with a gel to reduce gingival inflammation. Twenty dogs were randomised to the adelmidrol gel and placebo. After 30 and 45 days, the dogs using the adelmidrol gel had significantly less inflammation of the gingiva. Furthermore, the local application of adelmidrol has been recently confirmed to reduce MC responses during chronic experimental inflammation, as shown by the significant decrease of mediators selectively expressed by MCs and involved in skin inflammation, such as chymase. In cyclophosamide (CYP)-induced rodent models of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/PBS), CYP instillation caused macroscopic and histological bladder alterations, inflammatory infiltrates, increased mast cell numbers, bladder pain, increased expression of nitrotyrosine, and decreased expression of endothelial tight junction zonula occludens-1. Intravesical treatment with Vessilen (a formulation of 2% adelmidrol + 0.1% sodium hyaluronate) was able to ameliorate CYP-induced bladder inflammation and pain by inhibiting nuclear factor-Œ∫B pathway, and inflammatory mediator levels as well as reduced mechanical allodynia and nerve growth factor levels. Potential treatment applications for humans Adelmidrol seems suitable for topical application, as it exhibits both hydrophilic and lipophilic features, which help it to be absorbed into the skin, as the epidermis is composed of alternating lipophilic and hydrophilic layers. A 4-week topical treatment with adelmidrol 2% emulsion in children affected by mild atopic dermatitis resulted in complete resolution in 80% of cases, with no side effects and no relapses at 8-week follow up. Adelmidrol is one of the components of the anti-inflammatory drug mixture Vessilen, which is indicated for the intravesical treatment of IC/PBS. With once weekly bladder instillations for an 8 week course, it was found that Vessilen¬Æ treatment was able to produce a significant improvement in quality of life and symptom intensity in patients with IC/BPS and other conditions associated with chronic urothelial inflammation.

He was a member of the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI, which stole documents from an FBI office and exposed illegal activity and abuses of power, including COINTELPRO. Life Raines was the son of an affluent Methodist minister in Minneapolis. He graduated from Carleton College in 1955 with a major in English, and went on to study Christian social ethics at Union Theological Seminary. In 1961 he became involved in the civil rights movement after he was invited by the Congress of Racial Equality to travel as part of the Freedom Rides on an integrated bus from St. Louis to Little Rock. It was on this trip, where white mobs met the riders and he was briefly sent to jail, his eyes were opened to injustice and its intersection with his own Christian faith. Raines and his wife, Bonnie, continued to be involved in political causes and protests in the coming years, even breaking into draft board offices to disrupt records related to the draft for the Vietnam War. He became a professor of religion at Temple University, where he taught for over 40 years. While a professor at Temple, Raines was approached by William C. Davidon, a Haverford College physics professor, who suggested breaking into the FBI office to find proof of illegal practices. While initially skeptical, John and Bonnie eventually became convinced and began planning the break in with a group of eight co- conspirators in the attic of their home. They targeted a small FBI office outside of city limits in Media, which had far less security than the more prominent Philadelphia building. The group carefully researched and made extensive preparations--Bonnie went undercover as a Swarthmore student studying FBI hiring practices of women, and was allowed access to the interior of the building, where she took note of security systems and layout. They decided to break in on March 8, 1971, the night of the historic boxing match between Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali, knowing that security personnel would be distracted by the fight. That evening, Raines was stationed in a getaway car parked near Swarthmore College while the others went into the office. The plan went almost without a hitch and was completed in less than an hour. In total, the group shoved more than 1,000 documents into suitcases, which they inspected in a nearby farmhouse that night, discovering that their suspicions about the FBI's activity were correct. They made copies of the documents and mailed them to three major news outlets, as well as two Democratic government officials. To preserve their safety, the group agreed never to meet again and went their separate ways. Several months later, FBI agents visited the Raineses at their house to ask if they had any information that could help them find the culprits behind the theft. Raines cited his indignation at the information from the documents published in the Washington Post and refused to offer his help. The case remained unsolved for decades until Raines revealed his involvement to investigative reporter Betty Medsger (who had initially broken the original story), long after the statute of limitations had past.
