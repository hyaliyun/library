The Cleveland Indians name and logo controversy refers to the controversy surrounding the club name and logo for Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Cleveland Indians, an American professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. Although the controversial logo Chief Wahoo has been officially removed, the Indian-themed name remains part of the Native American mascot controversy which has led over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts to publish resolutions or policies that state that any use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping that promote misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans. Protest of both the logo and name started in the 1970s, but moved quickly toward the retirement of Chief Wahoo when the 2016 World Series drew international attention to the team. Local groups say they will continue to advocate for a change of the team name, and object to the sale of merchandise with the Chief Wahoo image, which remains an example of racial stereotyping to many. Through the decades of protest, team representatives defended both the name and logo as part of their tradition, with no intention to disparage Native Americans. The Cleveland Indians officially announced on July 3, 2020 that the club would review its name in the wake of nationwide protests against the killing of George Floyd. Origin and significance of the name The name \\"Indians\\" originated from a request by club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace \\"Naps\\" following the departure of their star player Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season. An oft-repeated legend is that the name \\"Indians\\" was chosen because it was one of the nicknames previously applied to the old Cleveland Spiders baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, a Native American, played in Cleveland. The attribution of the new name as being in honor of Sockalexis, a member of the Penobscot Tribe of Maine, is generally discredited given the discriminatory treatment of Native Americans in general, and Sockalexis in particular during that era. The news stories published to announce the selection in 1915 make no mention of Sockalexis, but do make many racist and insulting references to Native Americans. Defenders often claim there is an intention to honor Native Americans and that there are ways to do so while retaining their current representations. Opponents of Native American mascots make no distinction between respectful or disparaging usage, both being based upon stereotypes. The resolution issued by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999 states: \\"Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices‚Ä¶\\" This point of view echos the position of the National Congress of American Indians, the oldest and largest organization representing enrolled tribal citizens in the United States: \\"Often citing a long held myth by non-Native people that 'Indian' mascots 'honor Native people,' American sports businesses such as the NFL‚Äôs Washington 'Redskins' and Kansas City 'Chiefs', MLB‚Äôs Cleveland 'Indians' and Atlanta 'Braves', and the NHL‚Äôs Chicago Black Hawks, continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when white superiority and segregation were common place.\\" Native American protesters in Cleveland also state that \\"retiring\\" Chief Wahoo would not be a sufficient solution to the issue, since both the name and logo would need to be changed to something that does not reference Native Americans in any way. Decline and elimination of Chief Wahoo At the beginning of 2014, the use of Chief Wahoo was officially reduced to secondary status in favor of a block \\"C\\", A small number of fans promoted \\"de-chiefing\\" of their team apparel by removing the Chief Wahoo logo as a silent protest while maintaining their support of the team. Team management declined to comment on the phenomenon, but pro-Wahoo fans made angry comments on social media. Chief Wahoo hats continued to be worn by the players with home white jerseys and alternate navy blue jerseys both at home and on the road. This drew attention in both the United States and Canada during both the 2016 American League Championship Series and the 2016 World Series. During Cleveland's 2016 playoff series with the Toronto Blue Jays, Renu Mandhane, chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission called upon the media outlets in Canada to stop using the name in view of the commission's general policy opposing the use of indigenous names and images in sports. Douglas Cardinal, who is of Blackfoot descent and architect of the National Museum of the American Indian, filed a human rights complaints with Ontario's Superior Court of Justice and human rights tribunal seeking to ban the use of both the name and logo, as well as names and logos of other sports teams deemed offensive, in Ontario. Protests continued as Cleveland returned to the World Series for the first time in 19 years. In August 2016, a team spokesman said the team was \\"very cognizant and sensitive to both sides of the conversation\\" but had \\"no plans of making a change.\\" Hundreds of Native Americans protested outside the stadium during the first game of the series. The National Congress of American Indians sent a request to Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred that members of the Native American community be included in any discussion; the request was in response to Commissioner Manfred's announcement that he planned to meet with Cleveland Indians owner Paul Dolan about the issue following the conclusion of the 2016 Major League Baseball season. In advance of this meeting, the president of the American Sociological Association (ASA) sent a letter to Commissioner Manfred stating that the ASA and many other scholarly organizations have issued policies based upon scientific research that the use of Native American names and logos reinforces stereotypes and creates a hostile environment for Native Americans. Discussions between the team and MLB continued at the beginning of the 2017 season, with pressure from Manfred that there should be progress towards elimination of the logo. Starting in the 2019 season, the Chief Wahoo logo will not appear on uniforms nor on stadium signs. Merchandise featuring the logo will still be available at the Indians' ballpark and retail stores in Ohio, but will no longer be sold on the league's website. Chief Wahoo as a racial caricature Cleveland Indians logo in 1946 Chief Wahoo The Chief Wahoo image was the Indians logo beginning in 1947, and is part of an exhibit at the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia maintained by Ferris State University in Michigan. For Dr. David Pilgrim, a sociology professor at Ferris State and an expert in racial imagery, the symbol is a \\"red Sambo\\" that hardly differs from the caricatures of Blacks popular in the Jim Crow era in which Wahoo was created, when such depictions of minority races were popularly used to inflame prejudice and justify discriminatory laws and behavior. Pilgrim explains how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricaturized race is inferior. Bob DiBiasio, the team's then-Vice President of Public Relations, defended the use of Chief Wahoo, saying that fans only associate the Chief Wahoo image with baseball, while framing the team's decision to no longer \\"animate or humanize the logo\\" in terms of their \\"acknowledgement of the sensitivities involved.\\" The head of the Cleveland American Indian Movement has described the use of the mascot as \\"exploitative, bigoted, racist, and shameful.\\" Stanley Miller, while the executive director of the NAACP's Cleveland branch, lamented the lack of response to Chief Wahoo's use. In a 2008 interview, Miller said that if black Americans were depicted in an image akin to Chief Wahoo, \\"the NAACP would be up in arms about it. The Urban League would be up in arms about it.\\" Legal scholar Steve Russell, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation stated in 2001: \\"The Cleveland Indians are probably the least offensively named professional team, until you meet Chief Wahoo. It is like naming a team the 'African-American Freedom Fighters' and then making Sambo the mascot. It is like naming a team 'La Raza' and then resurrecting the Frito Bandito for mascot duty. No one can make the honor claim with a straight face, unless they seriously think Chief Wahoo is a straight face.\\" A particular problem with Chief Wahoo is that it includes a feather, which has special cultural significance to many Native American tribes. Ellen Baird, a Native American professor of sociology, says that the feather depicted in the logo is traditionally given to a warrior wounded in battle, and alleges that institutional racism prevents people from learning of this. =Social science research= In a 2008 journal article \\"Of Warrior Chiefs and Indian Princesses\\", psychologist Stephanie Fryberg and colleagues studied the effects on American Indian high school students of exposure to Chief Wahoo and other depictions of Native Americans. While reporting positive associations to the images, effects included lower self-esteem, community worth, and fewer achievement-related possibilities for themselves. Follow-up research on American Indian college students again found that exposure to Chief Wahoo resulted in depressed predictions of future achievement. The researchers concluded based upon Social Representation Theory that these results were due to the relative absence of alternative positive images of Native Americans in contemporary society. Instead, mainstream characterizations of American Indians often invoke stereotypes such as alcoholism, higher school dropout and suicide rates; while sports mascots relegate Native Americans to the past, leaving little space for Native students to define a positive identity or think of themselves in terms of everyday social roles. Subsequent research has found that exposure to the Chief Wahoo image \\"activated negative, but not positive, American Indian stereotypes\\", and that the predominantly European-American study participants' \\"motivation to control prejudice, prejudice level, and experience did not predict negative stereotype activation\\". In 2010, the authors of a paper published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology reported the results of two studies on the effects of American Indian mascots on observers. According to the authors, \\"both studies show that participants primed with an American Indian sports mascot increased their stereotyping of a different ethnic minority group.\\" The alternative weekly publication Cleveland Scene sardonically interpreted these results to mean that \\"looking at Chief Wahoo, the mere existence of Chief Wahoo, can change your opinions of a whole separate ethnicity\\", adding that the study \\"probably confirms that Clevelanders and Indians fans are inclined to stereotype and hate just about every group in the world.\\" The magazine Pacific Standard also framed the study in terms of the Indians' logo, headlining their story \\"Chief Wahoo's Revenge: One Stereotype Begets Another\\". Richard Lapchick, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports, has called the logo \\"the most blatantly offensive of all the symbols I've seen of Native Americans\\" during 40 years working in his field. An article in a 2010 psychology text cited Chief Wahoo as an example of a racial microaggression. =Acceptance of Chief Wahoo in schools and libraries= A 2012 report on the use of Native American mascots by the Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction described Chief Wahoo as an example of a stereotypical Native American image. In a 2009 guidebook on evaluating American Indian resources for classroom use, the Montana Office of Public Instruction has described Chief Wahoo as an example of a disrespectful image of Native Americans. The faculty senate at Kent State University passed a resolution in 2004 objecting to the use of Chief Wahoo by members of the school community. Students at Oberlin College discussed the logo's use in 2001 with team owner Larry Dolan, who formerly served on Oberlin's board of trustees. The head of the American Indian Council at Oberlin presented Dolan with a packet \\"containing historical, scholarly and position papers about American Indian team mascots\\". In 1999, Cuyahoga County Public Library barred its workers from wearing the Chief Wahoo logo to work. The ACLU protested the decision, and the legal director for ACLU Ohio said that the issue was one of free speech, not racism. The Youth \\"Indian\\" Mascot and Logo Task Force is a group in Wisconsin that has asked high schools to retire Native American mascots. In a statement, the group has contrasted the relative acceptance of Chief Wahoo versus that of Little Black Sambo: \\"How is it that our society can agree to get rid of the image of 'Little Black Sambo', but allow our schools to continue to use caricatures like 'Chief Wahoo' or the sacred symbolism of a chief's headdress? In an age when we are teaching our children to be morally responsible and racially sensitive, we cannot continue to let this form of institutional racism be a matter of choice.\\" =Depictions in artwork= Charlene Teters appears before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs during a May 5, 2011 hearing. Teters has called Chief Wahoo a \\"blatant racist caricature\\" that \\"honors neither Indian or non-Indian people\\". Work by Edgar Heap of Birds that appeared on a billboard near the Cleveland Indians' ballpark The Chief Wahoo image was featured in a 2012 Ohio Historical Society exhibit called Controversy 2: Pieces We Don't Talk About. The exhibit featured \\"difficult\\" objects from Ohio Historical Society collections, including a vintage Chief Wahoo jacket, a Nazi flag, and 19th-century prints that stereotyped African Americans. The following year, the National Museum of the American Indian advertised a daylong seminar on racist stereotypes in American sport with a handout that featured the Chief Wahoo image. Native American artist Charlene Teters has incorporated Chief Wahoo merchandise into installation pieces. She describes this art as \\"an extension of the work that I've been doing on the front lines, of the struggle to remove stereotypes and symbols that reinforce the stereotype of the Native people\\". Teters goes on to say, \\"What I do is collect these things and put them in a context for people to examine them. I think that we become so desensitized to them that we don't even see them for what they are. And so what I'm doing is putting them in a very concentrated space for people to feel the bombardment. The purpose for me is to create a forum for people to debate the issue.\\" In a work titled What We Know About Indians, large black and white portraits of the artists' family members are \\"blocked\\" by brightly colored overlays of mass-media depictions of Native Americans. Teters' childhood portrait is overlaid with a Disney image of Pocahontas, and another portrait is overlaid with an image of Chief Wahoo. In 1996, the Cleveland Institute of Art opened an exhibit featuring the work of Hachivi Edgar Heap of Birds, a half-Arapaho, half-Cheyenne associate professor of art at the University of Oklahoma. Among the pieces he designed for the exhibition was a 25-by-12 foot billboard featuring an image based upon Chief Wahoo and the text \\"Smile for Racism\\". Amidst controversy, the school initially announced that the piece would not be funded or shown. Heap of Birds announced his intent not to attend the opening, and alleged that the school was afraid of losing donations from Indians owner Richard Jacobs. The Indians' spokesman had no comment on the matter, while the chairman of the institute's board explained that he was offended by the piece and said, \\"I don't think that's art.\\" Eventually, the school reversed its position after determining that it was contractually obligated to fund the work. Heap of Birds decided to attend the opening, and the piece was eventually shown. He produced at least two different variations on the work, referred to in a journal as American Leagues 1 and American Leagues 2, both of which used the same design. The billboard itself was installed in 1998 near the approach to Jacobs Field. Heap of Birds later wrote of his artwork: :\\"Today, Indian people must still struggle in order to survive in America. We must battle against forces that have dealt us among the lowest educational opportunities, lowest income levels, lowest standards of health, lowest housing conditions, lowest political representation and highest mortality rates in America. Even as these grave hardships exist for the living Indian people, a mockery is made of us by reducing our tribal names and images to the level of insulting sports team mascots, brand name automobiles, camping equipment, city and state names, and various other commercial products produced by the dominate culture. This strange and insensitive custom is particularly insulting when one considers the great lack of attention that is given to real Indian concerns. It must be understood that no human being should be identified as subservient to another culture. To be overpowered and manipulated in such a way as to thought to become [sic] a team mascot is totally unthinkable.\\" =Penobscot Nation opposition= Kenneth Paul, who at the time of a 1993 interview was Louis Sockalexis' oldest surviving relative, described his reaction to being photographed in a Chief Wahoo hat, saying, \\"They made me look like a fool.\\" On the subject of the logo itself, he said, \\"Wahoo or Yahoo, it's more insulting than anything. I think they should change the whole thing to something else. It won't break my heart. It won't break anybody's.\\" Paul's son, Kenneth Jr., has said of Chief Wahoo, \\"I wish they'd get rid of that smiling Indian head.\\" The Penobscot Indian Nation formally asked the Cleveland Indians to stop using the Chief Wahoo logo in 2000, unanimously passing a resolution calling on the team to retire the logo. The resolution stated that the Penobscot Nation found Chief Wahoo \\"to be an offensive, degrading, and racist stereotype that firmly places Indian people in the past, separate from our contemporary cultural existence.\\" It also said that the logo \\"emphasizes a tragic part of our history‚Äîfocusing on wartime survival while ignoring the strength and beauty of Indian cultures during times of peace.\\" Tribal Governor Barry Dana predicted that \\"reasoned discussion\\" would be productive and that the Cleveland franchise would be willing to talk with the Penobscot Nation. However, although Indians vice-president of public relations Bob DiBiasio received a hand-delivered copy, as of 2009 the team had not acknowledged the resolution. The Maine State Legislature then passed a bill that condemned the logo, making explicit reference to the team's failure to acknowledge the Penobscot resolution. The bill read in part: \\"WHEREAS, the Cleveland Indians team ignored a petition by the Penobscot Nation in 2000 to cease and desist the use of its caricature mascot \\"Chief Wahoo,\\" which the Penobscot Nation and many other Americans consider racist and disrespectful to the memory of Louis Sockalexis ... [we] respectfully urge and request that the Cleveland Indians baseball team immediately drop the use of the mascot \\"Chief Wahoo,\\" which would demonstrate the team understands the disrespect this symbol represents to the Penobscot Nation, the citizens of Maine and the legacy of Louis Sockalexis. Donna Loring, the Penobscot Indian Nation's representative to the Maine State Legislature, has criticized the logo, saying that it \\"denigrated the contribution that Sockalexis made to the team and to professional sports.\\" When the MLB commissioner Rob Manfred began discussing a change in 2016-2017, members of the Penobscot Nation again voiced their opposition to the logo as being derogatory, and distorting rather than honoring the legacy of Louis Sockalexis. History of protests When local Native Americans were asked to participate in the 175th anniversary of the founding of Cleveland in 1971, they used the occasion to protest the history of native mistreatment by non- natives, from massacres to Chief Wahoo. Protests have continued on Opening Day of the baseball season each year since 1973. The size of the protests grew in the 1990s. In 1991, a group called the Committee of 500 Years of Dignity and Resistance was formed to protest quincentennial Columbus Day celebrations. The next year, the group shifted its efforts, and since then has focused on protesting the Indians' team name and logo. In its early years, the group drew national media attention as it negotiated with team management over whether Chief Wahoo would continue to be used once the Indians moved to their new stadium. When the team moved to its new ballpark, the stadium manager, Gateway Economic Development Corporation, attempted to prohibit demonstrations there, and protesters sued for access. The logo drew renewed scrutiny during the 1995 World Series, when the Cleveland Indians played the Atlanta Braves. The games were marked by protests in both cities. The 1997 All-Star game was also home to protests; these were attended by a descendant of Louis Sockalexis, the Native American player in whose honor the Cleveland team is supposedly named. The Cleveland Indians played again in the World Series that year; before the series began ABC News covered the Chief Wahoo protests and named Native American activist and artist Charlene Teters their person of the week. Newspapers and other publications have described a tense atmosphere surrounding these protests, some of which resulted in legal actions (see below). Reporters have described antagonistic behavior from game attendees (e.g, shouting \\"You killed Custer!\\", or directing war whoops at protesters), and characterized fans as \\"ambivalent and sometimes belligerent\\". According to researchers, \\"it is the protestors whose phenotypic traits correspond with stereotypical representations of Indians that receive the most negative attention ... [the] most vocal fans make darker-skinned protestors the targets of their most disparaging remarks\\". Physical confrontations have included fans throwing beer on protestors, and participants have described derogatory remarks: > \\"Each year for the past six or seven years I have joined our native American > brothers and sisters and others from the Cleveland area in protesting the > use of the racist symbol of Chief Wahoo. Each year we stand outside the > stadium, and hear people yell at us to 'go back home.' The irony of telling > a native American to go back home is never understood by them it seems.\\" Protests remain a regular feature, but are smaller than they were in the 1990s. Today, the Committee of 500 Years of Dignity and Resistance has 8 to 12 core members and a total membership of approximately 150 people. Researchers have suggested that Cleveland's low Native American population and its transient status, traveling to and from reservations, have contributed to recruiting difficulties. American Indian Movement chapters elsewhere in the country have sometimes held protests at Cleveland's away games. =Arrests and legal appeals= When the Cleveland Indians played in the 1997 World Series, protesters demonstrated against the team's use of the Chief Wahoo mascot. When American Indian activist Vernon Bellecourt burned an effigy of Chief Wahoo, police arrested him and ordered others to leave. Later, the police arrested two other protesters who had moved to another part of the stadium. Officials claimed all three had actively resisted arrest. Bellecourt was charged with criminal endangerment and resisting arrest, while the other two were charged with criminal trespass and aggravated disorderly conduct. Charges against the defendants were later dismissed. During opening day protests in 1998, Cleveland police arrested three protesters for burning an effigy of Chief Wahoo, and shortly thereafter arrested two more protesters for burning an effigy of Little Black Sambo. They were booked and jailed for aggravated arson. However, no formal charges were filed after the booking, and the protesters were released the next day. The protesters, led by Bellecourt, later sued the city for violating their free speech rights. In 2004, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in a 5‚Äì2 decision that the arrest did not violate the protesters' First Amendment rights. Justice Maureen O'Connor wrote in the majority opinion that \\"without question, the effigy burnings were constitutionally protected speech,\\" but, citing the 1968 U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. O'Brien, O'Connor also wrote that \\"the windy conditions coupled with the spraying of additional accelerant on the already burning effigies created a hazard\\" and that \\"the police were obligated to protect the public, including the protesters themselves.\\" In 2004, ruling on a lawsuit brought by protesters who wished to demonstrate against Chief Wahoo's use, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the sidewalks near Jacobs Field were a public forum and the owner could not place content-sensitive restrictions on its use. Demonstrators had moved their protests to a nearby public area while the case was pending. =Individual Native Americans= After the Indians' management chose to retain Chief Wahoo in 1993, Clark Hosick, executive director of the North American Indian Cultural Center in Akron, Ohio, explained his position on the logo. Hosick said he believed that the logo encouraged stereotypical comments, such as sports reports describing how \\"the Indians scalped\\" their opponents. He also said that he believed some of these comments would disappear if the team dropped the logo. Charlene Teters, a Native American artist and activist, was interviewed for a 1997 story on Chief Wahoo and remarked, \\"We are the only group of people still used as mascots. You wouldn't have someone painted in blackface run on the field.\\" Teters again discussed the logo in a 2009 documentary produced by New Mexico PBS: \\"This image should have gone by the wayside along with Little Black Sambo and the Frito Bandito. ... That this image honors neither Indian or non-Indian people, and that I think anyone who looks at this can recognize it as a blatant racist caricature, tells you, really, again, our place in the society. ... If it is trivial, as they like to say, then why is there any objection whatsoever to changing these images? I really feel that it has to do more with power than it has to do with money.\\" In a 2011 statement before the Senate, Morning Star Institute president Suzan Shown Harjo cited Chief Wahoo as an example of the \\"savage savage\\" stereotype of Native Americans (as opposed to the \\"noble savage\\"), describing the logo as one of several prominent \\"hideous, inhuman, insulting or just plain dumb-looking\\" depictions. Russell Means has criticized Chief Wahoo, saying, \\"It epitomizes the stereotyped image of the Native American. It attacks the cultural heritage of the American Indian and destroys Indian pride.\\" James Fenelon, a researcher and member of the Dakota tribe, has described Chief Wahoo as an \\"unambiguous racial icon meant to symbolize stereotypical and usually negative images of Native people as \\"wild\\" but \\"friendly\\" savages.\\" Writer Jack Shakely described his childhood purchase of Chief Wahoo hat in a Los Angeles Times editorial that criticized the use of Native American mascots: > \\"I got my first lesson in Indians portrayed as sports team mascots in the > early 1950s when my father took me to a Cleveland Indians-New York Yankees > game. Dad gave me money to buy a baseball cap, and I was conflicted. I loved > the Yankees, primarily because fellow Oklahoman Mickey Mantle had just come > up and was being touted as rookie of the year. But being mixed-blood > Muscogee/Creek, I felt a (misplaced) loyalty to the Indians. So I bought the > Cleveland cap with the famous Chief Wahoo logo on it. When we got back to > Oklahoma, my mother took one look at the cap with its leering, big-nosed, > buck-toothed redskin caricature just above the brim, jerked it off my head > and threw it in the trash. She had been fighting against Indian stereotypes > all her life, and I had just worn one home. I was only 10 years old, but the > look of betrayal in my Creek mother's eyes is seared in my memory forever.\\" Native American writer and filmmaker Sherman Alexie has referenced Chief Wahoo when describing the impact of his book The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven: \\"To break Indians out of museums and movies and Chief Wahoo‚Äîthat's a legacy for any book.\\" In an interview for Time magazine, Alexie compared the logo to Little Black Sambo: \\"A lot of people think it's a minor issue. Google search Chief Wahoo, put it up on one side of your screen, and then Google search Sambo, and put it on your screen. And this horribly racist, vile depiction of African Americans looks exactly like the Chief Wahoo mascot of the Cleveland Indians. Exactly. And why is one acceptable and the other isn't?\\" An article in the Santa Cruz Sentinel described Alexie's point of view that white people have the privilege of being appalled at logos like Chief Wahoo, but that being appalled never feels like being humiliated. Anton Treuer, author of Everything You Wanted to Know About Indians But Were Afraid to Ask, was asked in an interview whether \\"native people can be more readily imagined than known\\". Treuer replied that this was the case, and cited sports mascots as an example. He went on to describe the persistence of Chief Wahoo: \\"We've come a long way since, you know, Little Black Sambo, you know, effigies and things like that kind of dominated the cultural landscape in America, but for some reason Chief Wahoo has persisted.\\" The issue was framed similarly in The Praeger Handbook on Contemporary Issues in Native America by Bruce Elliott Johansen. Johansen writes: > \\"The term Indians, on its face, is not overtly defamatory. Sometimes the > context, not the name itself, is the problem. In the case of the Cleveland > Indians, face value is the clincher ‚Äî the face, that is, of the stupidly > grinning, single-feathered Chief Wahoo.\\" A writer for The Encyclopedia of Race and Racism makes a similar point, writing that the \\"use of laudatory nicknames contrasts sharply with the practice of using racial caricatures as mascots‚Äîsuch as Chief Wahoo of the Cleveland Indians\\". Indian Country Today Media Network has called the logo \\"grossly offensive\\". =Legislative and legal challenges= There have been multiple failed legal and legislative attempts to end the use of Chief Wahoo. In 1972, Indian activist Russell Means announced a $9 million suit by the Cleveland American Indian Center against the team for libel, slander, and defamation from the use of Chief Wahoo. Writer Don Oakley criticized both the dollar amount and the grounds for the suit in an editorial article, saying, > \\"$9-million is 'umpteen' dollars in anybody's vocabulary, including that of > the original Chief Wahoo, the comic strip character who coined the word. But > the suit is real enough, and it reads like something that might have been > brought against a defendant at the Nuremberg trials ... Such a heavy burden > for such a little guy to carry. The 'racism' behind Chief Wahoo will be news > to the millions of people who have followed the baseball Indians over the > years, and who no more associated their symbol with real Indians than they > believe that Englishmen are short, pot-bellied, run around in knee breeches > and wear a Union Jack for a vest.\\" Russell Means described receiving hate mail for the only time in his career after a TV appearance on the subject, including letters advocating the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" of Indians, and the legal process lasted over a decade. In 1982, both sides announced that they were near an agreement; one method of settlement being considered was an annual \\"Indian Day\\" at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. A lawyer for the defense said that an out-of-court settlement was preferred, but that he doubted a financial agreement would be part of it. The suit was finally settled in 1983. In 1993, an Ohio state lawmaker promised to introduce legislation that would have blocked the use of public funds for a new stadium if the Indians did not change their logo. A similar measure had been introduced in 1992, but it failed to pass by six votes. Former Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White once condemned the logo as a racist caricature and proposed a referendum to strip it from all city-owned property, but the suggestion went nowhere. However, Juan Reyna, chairperson of a local activist group, criticized White's reasoning, saying, \\"There will never be a majority in favor of getting rid of it. There are more people at a single Indians game than all the Indians in the whole tri-state area. It needs to be done because it's the right thing to do.\\" A 1998 article in the Cleveland State Law Review outlined several possible legal challenges to the use and validity of the Chief Wahoo trademark. Among the possible arguments was the notion that the Indians' actions in Jacobs Field (since renamed \\"Progressive Field\\") were a state action according to the symbiotic relationship test established in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority. If there was also an implicit discriminatory intent in the design of the logo, then its use would be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The author indicated that this approach would face significant legal hurdles. An alternative and perhaps more successful approach would be to challenge the validity of the trademark, because trademark law bars the registration of disparaging or scandalous marks. A 1999 article in the Harvard Law Review also outlined an equal protection (Fourteenth Amendment) strategy for suits against teams that use native American names and symbols. Native American activists used one of these strategies‚Äîsuing to remove trademark protection on disparaging marks‚Äîagainst the Washington Redskins in the 1990s. After early victories for the activists, newspapers including the Ohio State University Lantern and The Akron Beacon Journal suggested that trademark protection for Chief Wahoo might be in jeopardy. A pair of editorials published in 2009 by The Akron Beacon Journal avoided the issue of trademark protection, but raised questions about how Chief Wahoo might affect Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption. One of the editorials concludes that money, not legal issues, will be the ultimate cause of change: \\"But private schools and private businesses like the Cleveland Indians and Washington Redskins have a constitutional right to call themselves whatever they want and, if they wish, they may use logos and mascots that offend people. When it no longer makes them any money they will change.\\" =Religious groups= In 1991, the United Church of Christ passed a resolution condemning the use of Chief Wahoo, saying that \\"the use and misuse of Native American imagery affronts basic human rights and dignity and has a negative impact on human self worth\\". The Native American head of the group's Indian council criticized the logo, saying, \\"The image that it depicts looks kind of sub-human. It doesn't look like someone I would consider to be Indian.\\" In an article on the resolution, the team spokesman defended the use of the logo, describing the team's relationship with the local Native American community as \\"very positive\\". Two years later, the Catholic Church's Diocese of Cleveland denounced the use of the logo in a statement by their Commission on Catholic Community Action to Promote Justice. The statement cited a 1988 Vatican document saying that acts \\"which lead to contempt and to the phenomena of exclusion must be denounced and brought to light without hesitation and strongly rejected in order to promote equitable behavior.\\" In 1997 the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, calling the use of Chief Wahoo \\"insulting and racially insensitive marketing,\\" succeeded in pressuring various companies to stop using the logo. As a result of their efforts, Anheuser-Busch stopped using Chief Wahoo in their Ohio beer ads, and Denny's Restaurants barred its Ohio employees from wearing the logo to work. The United Methodist Church denounced the use of Chief Wahoo in a vote taken during their quadrennial General Conference that took place in Cleveland in 2000. The measure passed without debate by a vote of 610-293, and was similar to previous resolutions that did not specifically mention Chief Wahoo. The United Church of Christ reaffirmed their position in 2000, when Bernice Powell Jackson, the executive director of the UCC Commission for Racial Justice and executive minister of one of the UCC's five covenanted ministries, called for the logo to be discontinued. When stadium management made efforts to exclude protesters, the United Church of Christ joined others in a First Amendment suit. A 2005 editorial appearing in Religion News Services said the UCC had been active against Chief Wahoo since the 1980s, and added that \\"no other major-league city has a logo with such an offensive stereotype\\". The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism has joined the UCC in their efforts. According to Mark Pelavin, the associate director of the organization, said that the UCC \\"asked us to sign letters to team owners and to join in some quiet meetings with team officials, and we were glad to do so\\". At their 2001 general assembly in Cleveland, the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations passed a resolution urging \\"the Planning Committee and the Board of Trustees to consult and cooperate\\" with the UCC's struggle against the use of the Chief Wahoo. At a 2012 Unitarian Universalist workshop in Cleveland, participants suggested joining again with the yearly protests against Chief Wahoo. =Response to protests by Cleveland management and partners= Former owner Richard Jacobs vowed not to drop the logo as long as he owned the team. When owner Larry Dolan bought the team in 2000, he said, \\"I have no problem with Chief Wahoo. I don't think there is any disrespect meant. If I did, I would consider a change.\\" Asked if the strength of the argument was more important than the size of the protest, team owner Larry Dolan agreed that it was, and said that \\"you can whip a group of non-thoughtful people to come up and protest anything\\". Later, in the same interview, Dolan described the protests in greater detail: \\"It frankly bothers me when I see protestors out there, every opening day. Invariably in the last few days, they want to go to the court to say they ought to be able to protest closer to where the folks are. Now, people who are serious about what they're about don't do it that way. It's difficult for me to give them a whole lot of credence when they just show up, television cameras are there, they do their thing, and they're gone. I'm not encouraging them to come back, you understand, but if we're going to have a possible dialogue, they need to understand where we're coming from.\\" The Oberlin student newspaper recorded the interview and quoted Dolan as saying, \\"I firmly reject that Wahoo is racist. I see that it makes some Natives uncomfortable‚Äîclearly not all. I think I understand racism when I see it.\\" The paper reported that Dolan claimed his incentive to action was weakened by the fact that Native Americans do not universally find the logo offensive. Larry Dolan's son, Paul Dolan, was at the meeting, and was quoted as saying, \\"Whether or not [Chief Wahoo] is offensive is not really a debate. Whether it's racist is really the crux of the issue.\\" Team spokesman Bob DiBiasio has defended the use of Chief Wahoo, saying that while the logo is a caricature, it is \\"not meant to represent anyone or any group.\\" He has also stated that Chief Wahoo is not meant to be racist, and asked \\"if there is no intent to demean, how can something demean?\\" DiBiasio has expanded on these statements elsewhere. In another interview, he said: > \\"We believe this is an issue of perception. We think people look at the logo > and they think about baseball‚Äîthey think about CC Sabathia, Bob Feller, > Larry Doby, and Omar Vizquel. The Wall Street Journal did an editorial about > the Jeep Cherokee and concluded that something cannot be demeaned if there > is no intent to demean. We still believe the vast majority of our fans like > Chief Wahoo.\\" Statements from other members of Cleveland management have ranged from noncommittal to very supportive. Kurt Schloss, former director of merchandising and now vice president of concessions, has defended the use of the logo as part of the team's identity: \\"Chief Wahoo is a piece of who we are. ... It's not about representing a person or a group, it's about our history.\\" In 2007, while working as general manager of the team, Mark Shapiro stated, \\"It's not an area I have control over or choose to focus.\\" In 2013, after becoming president of the Indians, Shapiro was asked by an interviewer about \\"the official position of the club on the, on the whole, you know, Chief Wahoo thing\\". He explained: > \\"I think you always want to be sensitive to anybody that finds it offensive, > that, you know ultimately the Indians name and the team, ah, is in > recognition of our pride and affiliation with the first Native American > baseball player. So I think what we choose to do is celebrate, you know, > Louis Sockalexis and his history and tradition with the Indians and, and not > to focus on uh anything that we would view, that, you know, anything that we > don't view and certainly don't want to put, uh, be offensive to anyone.\\" DiBiasio has described conversations about Chief Wahoo with the Cleveland American Indian Movement and others as \\"an exchange of ideas, concepts, philosophies\\". The Cleveland American Indian Movement also sought comment from Progressive Insurance, owners of the naming rights to the Cleveland stadium. The group's request had gone unanswered for several months as of May 2013, when a Progressive spokesperson claimed to have no knowledge of their letter. =Public opinion= Surveys from a 2012 dissertation on Native American identity in northeast Ohio identified several different American Indian viewpoints about Chief Wahoo. The majority of participants thought that the logo was harmful. However, there was disagreement among this group over whether the elimination of the logo should be a priority in light of the other issues facing Native Americans. Those who felt most strongly negative about the use of the logo tended to have lived in both cities and reservations. Participants were drawn from two groups, Native People Reclaiming Indian Identities (NatPride) and Relocated Indians of Ohio (RelOH). A 1995 survey asked college students whether the logo should be retained and whether its use was discriminatory. Indian and black students were most likely to believe that the logo was discriminatory and should not be retained.

The battalion served in World War I, World War II, Vietnam and the Global War on Terrorism with the 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne Divisions. The battalion was inactivated in 2014 as part of force reductions. History =World War I= 2-321 FAR traces its lineage to Battery B, 321st Field Artillery, which organized on 2 September 1917 at Camp Gordon, Georgia. After training at Camp Gordon until May 1918, the battery shipped to France, and participated with the regiment in the St. Mihiel, Meuse Argonne and Lorraine 1918 campaigns. Following the Armistice, the battery redeployed to the United States and was demobilized at Camp Dix, New Jersey in May 1919. =Interwar= =World War II= =Early Cold War= =Vietnam= The 3d Brigade, 82d Airborne Division, with 2-321 AFAR attached from the Division Artillery, was alerted to deploy to Vietnam on 12 February 1968. The battalion commander was LTC Howard C. Jelinek. At the time of notification, the battalion was at 50% strength, but received 211 \\"fillers\\" from within the 82d Division Artillery over the 16 hours following the deployment notification and deployed at 100% strength of 458 personnel (39 officers, 2 warrant officers and 416 enlisted personnel). Elements of the battalion deployed over the next two weeks. Battery A deployed with Task Force (TF) Privette (2d Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment [2-505 PIR]), arriving at Chu Lai between 16 and 19 February 1968. Battery C followed as part of TF Carpenter (1-508 PIR), arriving between 19 and 21 February 1968. The battalion headquarters controlled TF Jelinek, arriving from 21‚Äì23 February 1968, and Battery B deployed with TF Jameson (1-505 PIR), arriving 23‚Äì26 February 1968. The last aircraft in the brigade arrived at 0800hrs on 27 February 1968. Upon arrival in Vietnam, the battalion conducted in-country orientation training at the 23d Americal Division Combat Training Center under the operational control of the 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery. During the 6 days of training, Battery C was credited with the brigade‚Äôs first kill on 28 February 1968. Battery A provided direct support to 2-505 PIR from Fire Base Fat City, and then moved north by air with 2-505 PIR and established a fire base in Phu Bai base defense perimeter. Battery B provided direct support to 1-505 PIR from Fire Base Fat City, and Battery C provided direct support to 1-508 PIR from Landing Zone (LZ) Gator. On 2 March 1968, the battalion (less Battery A) began preparations to move north to Hue/Phu Bai. The brigade (less 2-505 PIR) departed Chu Lai by road in three serials, on 3, 4 and 6 March 1968. Each serial stopped at Da Nang overnight and arrived at Hue/Phu Bai on 4, 5 and 7 March 1968 without enemy contact. Upon arrival in Hue/Phu Bai, the brigade began development of Camp Rodriguez at map coordinates YD817147. Beginning 9 March 1968, the brigade conducted Operation Carentan I. The battalion counter-mortar radar supported from Camp Rodriguez. Battery A occupied FSB Panther in support of 2-505 PIR. Battery B supported 1-505 PIR from FSB Mongoose. When the brigade‚Äôs area of operations expanded ((on 29 March 1968??)), Battery B moved to FSB Sally. On 28 March 1968, Battery C received 20 rounds of 122mm rockets, wounding one man and damaging two ¬º-ton trucks. The rocket fire ceased when the battalion fired its counter-rocket program and the radar siting. On 30 March 1968, Battery B received 8 rounds of 82mm mortar, wounding three men and damaging the mess tent. Again, the fire ceased in response to the battalion‚Äôs counter-mortar fire. On 3 April, Battery C moved by road to FSB Geronimo in order to support 1-508 PIR in Area of Operations (AO) Bass. Battery A provided support from FSB Sally, supporting 1-501 PIR (attached to the brigade from the 101st Airborne Division) from 28 March ‚Äì 15 April 1968.

The 2-321 began May 1968 supporting Operation Delaware, with batteries at FSBs Boyd (Battery A) and Geronimo (Battery B), and at Camp Rodriguez (Battery C). On 3 May 1968, Battery B moved by road from FSB Geronimo to Camp Rodriguez, and Battery C moved from Camp Rodriguez to FSB Birmingham. On 26 May 1968, the battalion stood down for reorganization and training because of personnel rotation. The training emphasized FDC and FO procedures and airmobile operations. On 3 July 1968, Battery B conducted an artillery raid by air from FSB Panther II to FSB Panther III, fired 1000 rounds on suspected enemy positions and returned to FSB Panther II. On 9 July 1968, the battalion fired a preparation on LZ Green before it was occupied and developed into a battalion observation post. On 13 July 1968, the battalion, reinforced with medium and heavy artillery, conducted a one-hour prep of LZ Leach before elements of 1st Brigade assaulted the LZ.

On 22 August 1968, Battery A moved by air to FSB Panther III to support operations in the southern part of 3d Brigade‚Äôs area of operations. On 23 August, Battery B moved by air from FSB Boyd to FSB Brick. On 3 September 1968, Battery B moved by air from FSB Brick to FSB Greer, and was replaced at FSB Brick by Battery C from FSB Birmingham. On 9 September 1968, Battery C moved from FSB Brick to FSB Boyd. On 10 September 1968, Battery A moved from FSB Panther III to FSB Birmingham. On 12 September 1968, Battery A moved from FSB Birmingham to Camp Eagle to prepare to move to III Corps with 3d Brigade. On 1 October 1968, Battery C deployed from Camp Eagle to III Corps.

Released once a month from April to August 2016, each expansion pack adds a variety of different content, with Far Harbor being the largest in terms of additional gameplay and Nuka-World being the largest in terms of file size. The season pass contains all six expansion packs, and due to the size of Far Harbor, the price was increased after its release. All of the expansion packs were released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In order of release, the expansions packs are Automatron, Wasteland Workshop, Far Harbor, Contraptions Workshop, Vault-Tec Workshop and Nuka-World.  Automatron  Automatron was announced, along with Wasteland Workshop, Far Harbor and teases of other expansion packs, on the Bethesda Game Studios' blog on February 16, 2016. It is the first expansion pack and was released on March 22, 2016. It consists of a series of quests that unlock the ability to build and customize robots at the player's settlements. = Plot = The Sole Survivor intercepts a distress call from a trading caravan outside Cambridge, but arrives too late to save them from a horde of robots. After repelling the attack, the Sole Survivor meets Ada, a customized robot who had been travelling with the caravan. Lamenting her inability to save her owners, Ada agrees to join the Sole Survivor in the hopes of getting revenge and thwarting the wider threat posed by the Mechanist, the person assembling robots which have been attacking settlers and caravans across the Commonwealth. In order to locate the Mechanist, the Sole Survivor needs to triangulate the signal being sent to RoboBrains--a model of robot with a human brain as a central processing unit--the units controlling each individual cell of robots. After recovering the receiver devices from two RoboBrains overseeing scavenging operations, the Sole Survivor confronts the Rust Devils, a gang of raiders notorious for stripping robots for parts, in order to recover the third transponder. The Sole Survivor meets Jezebel, a RoboBrain unit held captive by the Rust Devils, and she agrees to help in exchange for building her a new body when they escape. Jezebel provides the Sole Survivor with the final transponder needed to locate the Mechanist, and a device that will allow Ada to open locked doors within the Mechanist's hideout. Before the Sole Survivor departs, Jezebel reveals that her mission was to save the people of the Commonwealth. Calculating that their odds of survival decreased without her presence, she decided that killing people was more humane as she could not always be present to save them. The Sole Survivor follows the Mechanist's signal to a robotics retailer and service center that was the cover for a secret military installation prior to the Great War. The facility was used to create RoboBrains, conditioning condemned prisoners and asylum inmates to have their brains removed, preserved and installed in robotic bodies; the trauma of the process accounts for the RoboBrains' difficult personalities. After fighting off waves of robots, the Sole Survivor confronts the Mechanist, who claims to be saving the Commonwealth. However, the Sole Survivor convinces her that the RoboBrains misinterpreted their orders and started killing innocent people. Horrified, the Mechanist reveals herself to be Isabel Cruz, a young woman with an affinity for making robots and trouble relating to people who was inspired to create the Mechanist persona after finding a child's drawings of a robot-themed superhero in the remains of a caravan that had been attacked by raiders. Devastated that her good intentions led to the deaths of innocents, Isabel retires from being the Mechanist and offers to help the Sole Survivor track down and destroy the rogue robots terrorizing the Commonwealth. = Reception = Automatron received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Kat Bailey from USgamer believed Automatron was one of the two essential expansion packs for Fallout 4. Wasteland Workshop Wasteland Workshop is the second expansion pack and was released worldwide on April 12, 2016. The release date for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox versions was also April 12 everywhere except Asia, where those versions were released on April 19. This pack does not contain any quests, but consists of a large number of new objects which can be constructed in settlement building mode. This includes new concrete structures, cages designed to capture creatures ranging from cats to deathclaws (including Raiders; human enemies) and various pieces useful for setting up gladiatorial combat arenas. =Reception= IGN's Jared Petty gave a negative review of the PC version which they described as offering \\"piecemeal additions\\", with some aspects being \\"briefly enjoyable\\" but not \\"fully fleshed out\\". It was given a score of 5.5/10.http://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/04/15/fallout-4-wasteland-workshop-dlc- review  Far Harbor  Far Harbor is the third expansion pack and was released on May 19, 2016. = Plot = Valentine's Detective Agency receives a request for help from the Nakano family, who live in a remote corner of the Commonwealth. Their daughter, Kasumi, has vanished without a trace or explanation, and the Sole Survivor is enlisted to investigate. They discover that Kasumi had been in contact with Acadia, a colony of escaped synths living on an island in Maine. With the aid of a local hunter named Old Longfellow, the Sole Survivor finds Kasumi living in Acadia. At Kasumi's behest, the player switches focus to investigating the synth DiMA, leader of Acadia, and learns that he has stored some of his memories outside his body. He has hidden them inside a computer simulation in the Children of Atom's base of Operations, the Nucleus, but has grown concerned that if the Children access the memories, they will have the means to destroy Far Harbor. The Sole Survivor travels to a former submarine base to recover DiMA's memories and learns that he put in place a series of fail-safes to protect Acadia and to preserve the balance of power between Far Harbor and a cult of the Children of Atom who have occupied the base. These are the access codes to a nuclear warhead, stored within the Nucleus, and the means to sabotage the fog condensers protecting Far Harbor. The Sole Survivor also discovers that DiMA murdered Captain Avery and replaced her with a synth to maintain peace between Far Harbor and Acadia. At this point, the player is faced with a choice: to destroy Far Harbor, to destroy the Children of Atom, inform the people of Far Harbor of DiMA's crime and start a war with Acadia, or, depending on the story's progress back at the Commonwealth, inform any of the three main Factions there and let them decide their fate themselves. Alternatively, the player may establish a more permanent peace between all parties by assassinating or chasing away High Confessor Tektus, and allowing DiMA to replace him with a synth who will adopt a more moderate stance towards Far Harbor. In the aftermath, the Sole Survivor returns to the Nakano family back at the Commonwealth, with or without Kasumi. = Reception = Fallout 4: Far Harbor received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Kat Bailey from USgamer believed Far Harbor was one of the two essential expansion packs for Fallout 4. Contraptions Workshop Contraptions Workshop is the fourth expansion pack and was released on June 21, 2016. Like the Wasteland Workshop, the Contraptions Workshop adds objects to the game's build mode--rather than story content--including prefabricated building models, manufactories that can produce equipment and items for the player, and items that the player can use to create elaborate Rube Goldberg-style machines. =Reception= Vault-Tec Workshop Vault-Tec Workshop is the fifth expansion pack and was released on July 26, 2016. =Plot= The Sole Survivor picks up a radio beacon from Vault 88, an unfinished fallout shelter located outside Quincy. Raider activity in the area has triggered the Vault's distress beacon, forcing the Sole Survivor to fight them off to gain entry. Once inside, the Sole Survivor meets Barstow, a ghoul who was originally intended to be the Vault 88 Overseer, but was sealed inside the unfinished Vault when the Great War started. Undeterred, Barstow intends to see Vault 88 complete its planned social experiment, and enlists the Sole Survivor in achieving her vision. After restoring power and broadcasting a signal, Vault 88 begins to receive settlers. Barstow and the Sole Survivor search for potential human guinea pigs in the population and find one in Clem, a na√Øve and enthusiastic--but nevertheless well-meaning--young man. Through Clem, Barstow and the Sole Survivor plan to conduct a series of experiments on the population. Barstow reveals that Vault 88's original purpose was to test a series of devices designed to minimize \\"social waste\\", or turn unproductive residents into contributing members of society. These include an exercise bike that provides power; a drinks station that can be spiked with a variety of drugs; and a device for examining eyes that can be used to read a person's thoughts. Each experiment has an additional set of parameters that can be chosen by the Sole Survivor. Upon the successful conclusion of the final experiment, Barstow confides to the Sole Survivor her ambitions of contributing to the Vault program with her own invention, a slot machine that can be used to identify deviant behavior in the population. After realizing this dream, she appoints the Sole Survivor as Overseer, intending to visit other Vaults with the results of their experiments. The Sole Survivor is skeptical, pointing out that many Vaults did not survive and that Vault-Tec no longer exists. However, Barstow counters that Vault-Tec should not be underestimated, implying that some part of the company survived and that the original Vault program was much larger than originally believed. =Reception= Brian Albert of IGN said the additional quests did not stand up on their own but the package was \\"settlement builder‚Äôs dream, through and through.\\" They rated the title 8.2/10.http://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/07/27/fallout-4-vault-tec-workshop-dlc- review Nuka-World Nuka-World is the sixth and last expansion pack and was released on August 30, 2016. =Plot= Nuka-World begins with the Sole Survivor picking up a radio broadcast and heading to the Nuka World Transit Station, in which they find a still functional monorail to Nuka World, a pre- war amusement park. Taking the train to the park, the Sole Survivor finds themselves trapped in a test called The Gauntlet, a series of traps and dangers intended to stop all but the strongest from entering Nuka World. After reaching the end of the Gauntlet, Gage, a raider occupying the park, contacts the Sole Survivor and proposes a deal to defeat current Overboss, Colter. Colter is highly unpopular amongst the raider gangs who occupy Nuka World - The Operators, The Disciples and The Pack. Facing off against each other in the Arena, Colter is killed and the Sole Survivor becomes the new Overboss. Now in command of the area, the Sole Survivor must decide on either siding with the raiders and retaking the other park areas and spreading their influence into the Commonwealth, or instead turning against the raiders and restoring Nuka World by themselves. =Reception= Dan Stapleton of IGN said the DLC had \\"a great setting that's densely packed with spectacle\\" but had a lack of meaningful decisions in comparison to Far Harbor. It was rated 7.9/10.http://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/30/fallout-4-nuka-world-dlc-review References External links * Fallout 4 Website * Category:2016 video games Category:Fallout video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Lists of video game downloadable content Category:Bethesda Game Studios games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video game downloadable content ","title":"Fallout 4 downloadable content"},{"id":"48419218","text":"Edward Cox (died 18 May 1868) was an English-born Australian politician.

In the 1870s it was known as the Kaloola Railway. It is also known as Cooloola Railway, SEQ-5N 22, Pettigrew's Railway, and Pettigrew's Tramway. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 July 2013.  History  William Pettigrew, 1875 William Pettigrew's Cooloola timber operation began in the 1860s with the extraction of timber from Woolann (the area around Lake Poona). Bullock teams were used to drag Kauri pine logs to the mouth of Seary's Creek. The sandy nature of the terrain and lack of feed for horses and bullocks made traditional forms of timber transport unfeasible and Pettigrew had to find a solution to access the rich timber of inland Cooloola. The answer was the construction of a tramway: Cooloola Tramway opening in October 1873 as Queensland's first major private railway. Of all Queensland's natural resources \\"timber was the most visible and abundant to the first Europeans\\". Early European accounts of Queensland frequently refer to the extensive stands of timber which lined the coast and river banks. In south-east Queensland the dominant timber species were softwoods such as Hoop (Araucaria cunninghamii) and Kauri pine (Agathis robusta). When Moreton Bay was opened up to free settlement in 1842 the colony did not have a sawmill and logged timber was either pit sawn and used locally, or sent south for milling and/or export. The timber industry played a vital role in the economic development of Queensland and William Pettigrew was instrumental in this process. He was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1825 and came to Moreton Bay in 1849 as one of Dr John Dunmore Lang's immigrants on board the \\"Fortitude\\". Pettigrew was engaged as a surveyor and land agent by Lang. When Lang's immigration scheme collapsed, Pettigrew worked with Assistant Government Surveyor, James Warner. In this role he gained \\"first-hand knowledge of the local timber resources and the need for a sawmill to facilitate the expansion following the transformation of Brisbane from convict settlement to free society\\". Advertisement for William Pettigrew's sawmill, corner of William and Margaret Streets by the Brisbane River, 1861 In 1853 Pettigrew established Queensland's first steam sawmill on land adjacent to the Brisbane River, at the western corner of William and Margaret streets in Brisbane. According to Kerr, Pettigrew's sawmill was arguably Queensland's first major industrial enterprise. With the establishment of this sawmill, Brisbane became the key local market for timber. William Sim, an experienced timber worker from Nairn, near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, began working at the Brisbane Saw Mills in August 1854. With Sim in charge, the quality of product improved and production increased. The first sawmill to be opened in Maryborough was Gladwell and Greathead's Union Sawmill in 1861, which established the city as a timber- getting town. Pettigrew was anxious to retain his monopoly in Queensland and began to explore the Maryborough area, looking for new sources of timber and a site for a sawmill to supply the northern ports of Gladstone, Rockhampton and Bowen. In August 1862, Pettigrew explored the Mary River with Tom Petrie and in October decided on the site for his sawmill - downriver from Maryborough. On Pettigrew's return to Brisbane, he established a partnership agreement with Sim, who paid for a quarter share in the new firm of Pettigrew and Sim. The new sawmill was called Dundathu and began operating in August 1863. The Maryborough timber industry industrialised and grew rapidly during the 1860s. In 1876 more timber (mainly sawn pine) was produced in Maryborough than had been exported from Queensland in the preceding 10 years. A number of firms were established including Wilson, Hart and Bartholomew; and James Fairlie. Despite early competition from Gladwell and Greathead's Union Sawmill, Dundathu Sawmill quickly proved profitable, shipping timber to Sydney, Gladstone, Rockhampton and Bowen. Pettigrew continued to seek out timber resources which could be milled at Dundathu. In September 1863, he set off in the paddle steamer Gneering to search for stands of timber that were reported to exist in the Noosa area. On his return Pettigrew concluded that the timber was disappointing and inaccessible. However, others did not agree and by the end of 1863, timber-getters were operating in the lower Noosa area. Pettigrew turned his attention to the north, and in late June 1865 Pettigrew landed at the head of Tin Can Bay to examine the area further. His discovery of Kauri pine in the Woolann area of north Cooloola provided the main source of timber for the Dundathu Sawmill. By 1865, Pettigrew's men were using bullock teams to drag Kauri pine logs from Woolann (the area around Lake Poona). Early timber- getters are recorded as using a corduroy crossing of tea-tree branches and saplings to cross the tidal flats in the northern Cooloola area. Pettigrew's men dragged the logs to the mouth of Seary's Creek, tied them into large rafts and towed them through the Tin Can Bay Inlet, Great Sandy Strait and up the Mary River. Tugs were then used to haul the rafts of timber to Dundathu. The sandy nature of the terrain and lack of feed for horses and bullocks made the use of draught animals for transport very difficult. Pettigrew needed to develop a more expedient alternative. In July 1865 Pettigrew noted in his diary that of railway, the majority of which would cross flat, \\"barren\\" sandy country, would enable the timber to be taken out of inland Cooloola to Tin Can Bay. Pettigrew had previously written to Arthur Macalister-the Minister for Lands and Works-about a railway between his operations on the Maroochy and Mooloolah rivers, and was told that the government would not fund railways, and therefore they must be private. In 1863 Pettigrew had begun to experiment with horse-drawn wagons on timber tramlines in the yard of Dundathu and installed wooden-railed lines and turntables to transport the timber around the large sawmill. By 1864 Pettigrew had become concerned that the \\"unbridled competition\\" permitted by the Timber Regulations was causing quarrels among timber-getters and encouraged over-cutting and waste. Pettigrew wrote to Macalister in April 1864, \\"setting out arguments for protecting timber-getters who made improvements such as roads for the extraction of timber, but could not then prevent others from using them\\". In response, Macalister introduced special timber licences in 1864 which gave their holders exclusive rights to cut and remove timber from specified areas where ordinary timber licences did not apply. The Crown Lands Alienation Act 1868 opened up the Noosa area for selection. By April 1869, Pettigrew was concerned that the new selection laws might override his Special Timber Licences and allow selectors to take over his Kauri pine forests in northern Cooloola. As a result, he sent Surveyor Byrne to survey his land at Woolann, which became Portions 1 and 2, Parish of Cooloola. On 3 May 1869, Pettigrew applied for the selections in the name of his partner William Sim. By this time, Pettigrew had lost the best timber at Noosa, the Kin Kin Creek timber, to merchants and sawmillers McGhie, Luya and Co who established the Kin Kin Sawmill. The forests of Cooloola were physically difficult to exploit and remote from the settlements at Brisbane, Maryborough and Gympie, however, the extent and quality of the resource first attracted independent cutters and later sawmillers to the area. Sawmillers operating in the area included Wilson, Hart and Co. of Maryborough; Hyne and Son of Maryborough; Ramsay and Co. of Mungar, Ferguson and Co. of Gympie; and Dath, Henderon and Co. of Tewantin. However, the 2 firms that dominated the trade in Cooloola were Pettigrew and Sim at Tin Can Inlet in the north, and McGhie, Luya and Co. on the Noosa River in the south. After the Gympie gold rush of 1867, demand for timber increased exponentially and the timber industries of Maryborough and Cooloola boomed. In October 1872, Pettigrew and Sim arrived at Cooloola and began surveying a route for a tramway. By this time their men were extracting timber from Thannae Scrub (located to the south of Woolann), and taking it out through Cooloola Creek. Pettigrew located a suitable terminus on Cooloola Creek and commenced surveying a tramway towards Thannae Scrub. Its construction was underway by January 1873. Pettigrew planned the technical details of the line and ordered materials, and Sim supervised the laying of the track. Sim contributed some of the funds for the tramway by purchasing a further quarter-share in Pettigrew and Sim for in September 1871. \\"Mary Ann\\", first locomotive on the Cooloola Tramway, first locomotive built by Walkers Limited, first locomotive built in Queensland, circa 1875 The locomotive for the tramway was built especially for the line by John Walker and Co of Maryborough. According to Pettigrew, it was \\"the first locomotive built in Queensland\\". The locomotive was named \\"Mary Ann\\" after the daughters of Sim and Pettigrew: Mary Ann Sim, born 21 February 1856, and Mary Ann Pettigrew, born 25 December 1865. The design of the engine was described as: \\"... a compact little affair, of peculiar make, the cylinder, boiler, and working parts being upright, not horizontal, as in most ordinary locomotives. The reason for this arrangement is found in the necessity for placing the wheels at as short a distance from each other as possible in order to admit of the locomotive working smoothly round the sharp curves that must necessarily occur on a line rudely laid down in an unsettled and often rough country\\". The locomotive made a test run on wooden rails laid down Bowen Street on 30 June 1873. According to the Maryborough Chronicle \\"many of the inhabitants, both old and young, spent a pleasant hour in riding to and fro on the novel conveyance\\". Pettigrew was proud of their accomplishment and ordered 7 copies of a photograph of the engine, sending them with explanatory letters to: Governor Normanby, the Minister for Works; the editor of The Courier; politician Charles Lilley; journalist Theophilus Parsons Pugh; architect FGD Stanley and engineer John Sinclair. After the trials the \\"Mary Ann\\" was immediately shipped to Tin Can Bay. In July 1873 Pettigrew joined Sim to inspect progress and try out the \\"Mary Ann\\" on the tramway. The rails were sawn at Maryborough, and taken by steamer to the tramway. The \\"Mary Ann\\" itself was used to saw the Cypress pine sleepers for the tramway as the line progressed. Pettigrew explained the process in his letter to the Governor dated 5 August 1873: > It is now at work preparing its line from Thannae to Tin Can Bay. On side of > framing is seen a pulley. This is for driving a circular saw bench for > cutting up the sleepers. The bench is mounted on two trucks, and is taken > along the line as required...The country is barren sandy ground, and the > line...is over pretty even ground, requiring no cutting or banking at least > as far as yet made.

The two > miles already laid has cost about ¬£200 per mile. The line was opened on 29 October 1873 after had been laid. An official opening and celebratory picnic hosted by the Sim family was held on 30 October with a number of Maryborough's leading citizens attending. Guests travelled up and down the line and were given a parbuckling demonstration (the lifting of timber onto the train). Pettigrew could not attend, but Sim told the gathering that \\"Mr Pettigrew was at one with him in all these works\\". Workers standing on the Mary Ann, 1875 Pettigrew's tramway was Queensland's first major private railway. According to Kerr \\"the early adoption of tramways for hauling logs, and its influence on the development on the railways system in Queensland, centres on one man, William Pettigrew\\". The success of the Cooloola Tramway in drawing logs from inaccessible places and over difficult terrain encouraged other sawmillers to build light tramways. For example, in the mid-1870s McGhie, Luya and Co. constructed a tramway system across their property on Lake Cootharaba to their sawmill at Mill Point to overcome swampy, low-lying and poorly drained ground conditions. Pettigrew's influence on railways spread beyond the Cooloola area. In 1874 and 1879, he provided advice on the construction and use of tramways. He used his own tramway to demonstrate that a railway could be built for less than per mile; only a fraction of the cost of government railways, and critics began to condemn government extravagance. The fact that Pettigrew's and other private tramways were never designed to perform the haulage tasks required of government railways was not mentioned by the critics, however the cheap construction of the former did force a reduction in Government standards. Less than 3 weeks after the opening of the Cooloola tramway, William Sim was killed. Sim and a man named Cooper were unloading a log in diameter when the log fell off the truck before the men were ready and crushed Sim. Cooper was injured but not killed. According to the Maryborough Chronicle, William Sim was \\"one who has, in no small degree, contributed towards raising Maryborough to its present position of industrial and commercial prosperity\\". Pettigrew's close relationship with Sim is evident in a statement he made in 1900: \\"Till I got William Sim, nothing worth speaking of was done\\". After the death of William Sim, Pettigrew continued an association with the Sim family, and the Maryborough firm became known as Pettigrew and Company. During the late 1870s and early 1880s, Pettigrew's Maryborough interests were managed by William Menzies (the husband of Mary Ann Sim) and William Sim's sons; James Sim Tertius and William Simpson Sim. As time passed, members of the Sim family increased their shareholdings in the firm Pettigrew and Co., until they owned more than two-thirds of the business. William Sim's death and the destruction of the Brisbane Saw Mill by fire for the second time in 1874 postponed extensions to the Cooloola Tramway. At the time of Sim's death a little over half of the planned tramway had been constructed, however, on 25 May 1875 Pettigrew ordered of railway iron from Smellie and Co which was enough for approximately of rail. The planned extension of the tramway was in 2 directions: from the inland terminus (near what later became the site of the Forestry Department's Camp Milo) to a new terminus in the Broutha Scrub; and from Cooloola Creek (the original coastal terminus) north-west to a new coastal terminus at Poverty Point. In late October 1875, Pettigrew began to survey the extension from the first inland terminus into the Broutha Scrub. On a survey map dated 1876, timber-getter camps are recorded at the Broutha and Thannae waterholes with several structures relating to these camps. The Broutha and Thannae scrubs lay within a 1000-acre selection, Portion 274, which was held in the name of William Sim. Pettigrew carried out surveys and James Sim Tertius supervised the laying of the track. In November 1875, Pettigrew negotiated with Walker and Co for a second locomotive for , and a boiler () for (which may have been used to operate the winding engine). The new engine was called Dundathu and began running on 21 September 1876. The design of the locomotive Dundathu differed to the Mary Ann in that it had a neat cab with iron stanchions and a corrugated roof which protected the driver from all weather. All the gearing for starting, braking and reversing the locomotive were connected so as to be immediately under the driver's hand. Pettigrew had to overcome a number of obstacles in the construction of the tramway extension. Blocking the planned route were 2 ridges to the east of the original inland terminus and a third ridge which led into \\"the hollow\\" (or Broutha Scrub). To overcome the first 2 ridges, Pettigrew cut 2 steep-sided passes through them and filled the gully between them with the sand removed from the cuts, to ensure a gentle gradient. This formation was the only substantial earthworks carried out by Pettigrew on the route of the railway. The third ridge rose steeply over to a height of , followed by a descent of into Thannae Scrub. After persistent survey work, Pettigrew decided on 20 November 1876 to abandon the attempt to survey a conventional line down into the Broutha Scrub and opted for a balanced incline tramway. This entailed positioning a stationary winding engine on the top of the ridge. The tramway track came up the ridge on a side cut, crossed it and ran down into the Broutha Scrub on an embankment. A loaded wagon was kept on top of the ridge at all times so that \\"the effort of raising the loaded wagons, one at a time, was counter-balanced by the weight of the descending wagon\\", creating 2 isolated systems for locomotive purposes. The \\"Mary Ann\\" was used within Broutha Scrub to haul loaded wagons to the foot of the ridge, and the \\"Dundathu\\" took them from the other side of the ridge to the coast. The railway line was completed to its final inland terminus past Broutha Scrub in 1878. The residence of Robert Black, who managed Pettigrew and Sim's Cooloola operations, was located behind the Cooloola Creek landing place. It is likely that other timber-getters or workers on the line may have had residences within this area. A sawmill named \\"Kaloola\\" was constructed along the line. It was erected for the purpose of sawing up hardwood, principally for renewing the rails, consisted of a shed which measured , and was described as high and airy and roofed with sheet iron. A windmill was installed at the site of the sawmill to water the engine. The water used for this purpose was pumped from a waterhole. In July 1877, Pettigrew went with James Sim Tertius to the Cooloola Railway and surveyed the coastward extension. The original terminus on the eastern bank of Cooloola Creek was proving unsatisfactory, and Sim decided to extend the line across the creek and north-west to Poverty Point. The completed line was long. In 1874, Pettigrew told the Tramways Select Committee that he expected his tramway to last at least 10 years. Ten years later the operation did cease, and in March 1884, Pettigrew paid 2 final visits to the tramway and the timber-getters' camps at Broutha and Thannae waterholes. With the closure of the Cooloola tramway and increased competition from the other Maryborough sawmills, Dundathu lost the pre-eminence it had held since the 1860s. The locomotives \\"Mary Ann\\" and \\"Dundathu\\" and the stationary steam engine were sent back to Dundathu Sawmill and put up for sale. Pettigrew notes in his diary in March 1884 that 2 locomotives of gauge were up for sale, as well as truck wheels, axles, a windmill and pump, wheels and pinion. The engines were not sold, possibly due to their unusual gauge, and in January 1885 it was reported that the engines were being held in a shed at Dundathu. During the 1890s the timber industry in Cooloola entered a period of decline. As a result of the competitive and aggressive extraction of timber, the resource became depleted and most of the timber-getters and sawmillers were leaving the area. In the late nineteenth century, William Pettigrew, Richard Hyne and Abraham Luya spoke in the Queensland Parliament about the need for forest conservation. Although parts of Cooloola had been gazetted as Timber Reserves from the mid- 1880s, it was not until the State Forests and National Parks Act 1906 created the Queensland Forest Service that proper forest management was employed. The Dundathu Sawmill was damaged in the February floods of 1893 and then completely destroyed by fire in December the same year. The combination of the Brisbane floods in 1893 and 1898, the destruction of the Brisbane Saw Mills in 1874 and the Dundathu Sawmill by fire in 1893, and the enveloping economic depression brought Pettigrew's sawmilling empire to an end. On 26 July 1898 Pettigrew signed a petition of insolvency. Pettigrew died in Bowen on 28 October 1906 owning few assets. The obituaries described Pettigrew as \\"the pioneer sawmiller of Queensland\\" and the \\"father of the Queensland timber industry\\". Pettigrew's contribution to Queensland extended beyond his influence on the timber industry. He served as an Alderman on the Brisbane Municipal Council from 1863‚Äì66, 1868‚Äì73 and 1878‚Äì85 as Mayor of Brisbane in 1870-71; as a member of the first Caboolture Divisional Board from 1880-83 (being Chairman in 1881), and was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council in 1877 (resigning in 1894). Pettigrew was also a member of various boards, including the North Brisbane School of Arts, the National (Agricultural and Industrial) Association and the Philosophical Society (Royal Society from 1883) of Queensland, and boards of health. He was a founder of the Caledonian Association, and a trustee of the Paddington and Toowong cemeteries. Pettigrew was an elder and trustee in Presbyterian congregations and helped to establish a theological college, Divinity Hall, and the Queensland Evangelical Standard newspaper. In 1912 and 1924 surveyors assessed Cooloola's remaining timber resources, and the extraction of timber (mainly hardwoods) continued. Areas associated with Pettigrew's nineteenth century operations, including the Poverty Point terminus site and the former tramway route were utilized during the twentieth century. The Poverty Point firebreak which is believed to follow the tramway route in part was widened in the 1960s. In the 1960s a conflict over sand mining, forestry and future development in the region began. In 1970, environmental conservationists successfully fought to preserve Cooloola from sand mining. Queensland Titanium Mines, a subsidiary of American National Lead, was the principal mining company involved in the Cooloola controversy. In 1975, the Cooloola National Park (now the Great Sandy National Park) was gazetted. The western catchment of the Noosa River and the high dunes of northern Cooloola were later added to it.  Description  The Cooloola Tramway is located within the Cooloola Recreation Area, of the Great Sandy National Park, which lies between the coastal towns of Noosa Heads and Rainbow Beach. The first section of the tramway ran from the entrance of Cooloola Creek to a site near the former Forestry Department's Camp Milo. It was later extended into Broutha Scrub and the coastal terminus was changed from Cooloola Creek to Poverty Point. = Tramway route = The complete route of the tramway is currently unconfirmed. The tramway route is aligned with the Poverty Point firebreak, located on a slightly elevated ridge, for at least a portion of the firebreak. The site of the sawmill and windmill referred to in an article of Maryborough Chronicle may be located at a depression in the firebreak, just over from the Cooloola Creek terminus site. It is believed the windmill was located near the low- lying swampy area north of the Poverty Point firebreak, and the sawmill on the high ground south of the firebreak. Several stumps (possibly building stumps) have previously been located to the south-west of the firebreak, potentially marking the sawmill site. A route thought to be the continuance of the tramway begins east of the termination of the Poverty Point firebreak at Rainbow Beach Road and continues through vegetation to the entrance of the Eastern Firebreak (Pettigrew's Road). The route is particularly discernible in certain sections due to a clearly visible depression along the firebreak; the absence of regrowth along the track, and the way in which surrounding trees have arched over the track. Other portions of the route are harder to identify, with heavy regrowth and fallen branches. This route provides a smooth and direct line for the tramway from where it would have crossed Rainbow Beach Road to the Camp Milo area, the location of the first inland tramway terminus prior to its extension into the Broutha Scrub. Following the eastern firebreak past the site of Camp Milo, a series of cuttings and an embankment are evident. The presence of these features indicates that this portion of the firebreak aligns with Pettigrew's tramway route. It has been used as a road since the tramway closed and the engineering features are still very recognisable. Along the cuttings, the firebreak track is wide. The portion of embankment is wide with a slope of at an angle of 45 degrees. The height of the embankment is approximately . Beyond the cuttings and an embankment, the firebreak heads down into a more densely forested area. The tramway line is believed to have deviated from the Eastern firebreak at some point after the cuttings, as the firebreak becomes winding and steep and not suitable for the course of a tramway. A likely deviation of the tramway from the firebreak is located approximately halfway between Camp Milo and the site of the stationary winding engine. This route would have continued through the scrub, eventually climbing the incline and crossing the eastern firebreak to stationary winding engine. A route is clearly visible through the scrub with trees having grown around the track. At the top of the ridge above Broutha Scrub is the original site of the stationary winding engine. It is marked by a sign with the words \\"Site of steam engine and winch\\". The remains of this operation, including large bedlogs and metal fittings, are buried here. = Broutha Scrub = From the site of the stationary winding engine, the tramway descended south-east into Broutha Scrub. The tramway route into the scrub is still visible as an embankment approximately wide. This continues into Broutha Scrub to the tramway's second inland terminus. Investigations in Broutha Scrub have identified some wooden rails of the line still intact and in-situ, used to identify where the route of the tramway through the scrub ran. Other artefacts previously found within this area include bolts, a broken wheel, a grease tin and a knife. = Poverty Point = At Poverty Point, the site of the second coastal terminus, are the remains of a set of timber skids. Sawn logs were offloaded from the trams and rolled along these skids out into the bay for rafting. These skids are likely to relate to the later Hyne and Son timber- getting operation but may also overlay Pettigrew's use of the site. The eastern section of the skids is located on higher land towards the scrub. Substantially submerged, the lengths of three sizable logs are still visible, orientated from south-west to north-east. The south- western extent of the skids is the most exposed due to grading of this area by a 4WD track. The log lengths vary the northern log is long; the middle log is ; and the southern one is . The visible extent of the southern log is much shorter than the other two and is almost completely submerged under vegetation. The logs run almost parallel to each other with a variation of less than 5 degrees. The distance between the northern and middle logs is between the middle and southern ones. The mean diameter of the logs is . The western section of the skids is located within the intertidal zone. Nine logs, predominantly orientated at 230 degrees towards the bay, were visible at low tide. Only a small portion of these intertidal logs are visible above the sand and it is likely they extend even further into Tin Can Bay. = Cooloola Creek = A timber bridge is located at the point where the Poverty Point firebreak crosses Cooloola Creek. The bridge has been constructed with 4 layers of logs. The top layer has 6 longitudinal log beams; the second layer consists of 2; the third layer consists of 2 cross beams; and the fourth layer consists of 2 longitudinal log beams. The bridge measures . No bolts have been used in its construction; it appears to have been repaired over time. While this bridge would have been used by bullock teams post-dating Pettigrew's operation, the lower layers of the bridge, earthworks and inlaid timber on either side of the crossing may comprise part of a crossing used by Pettigrew and Sim. Just north of the Cooloola Creek timber bridge, a likely deviation of the tramway leading to Poverty Point has previously been identified, evident as a distinct cutting that follows an orientation of 280 degrees. The first tramway terminus site is located on the northern bank of Cooloola Creek. One cross beam, positioned against the bank, with 2 logs running perpendicular to it, relates to the use of this site as a terminus. A narrow strip of higher ground which extends to the east of the bank has previously been identified as a possible route for the tramway from the terminus site. = Tin Can Bay Inlet (between North Cooloola Point and Cameron Point) = A corduroy crossing is located within a north facing inlet of Tin Can Bay. Its location and orientation suggests it would have provided access to the Seary's Creek rafting ground. A series of logs have been laid parallel to each other, in a north-south orientation, each approximately long, to create the crossing which is in length. Some sections of the crossing remain intact with logs apart. Immediately north of the corduroy crossing is a feature previously identified as a wagon. All that remains are 2 sawn pieces of timber, approximately at their widest point, partially submerged, with only of the feature exposed above the ground. The feature is long. The western of the 2 pieces of timber has an iron bolt through it. Beyond the purported \\"wagon\\" are 2 wheels (previously identified as wagon wheels). Both are submerged in the sand, however the diameter of the first wheel (the northernmost of the two) could be discerned as . The second wheel is located from the first. The corduroy crossing may have been re-laid over time and as such surviving remnants may relate to Pettigrew's operation or a later timber- getting operation. = Seary's Creek = The feature identified previously as a rafting ground is located on the northern foreshore of Seary's Creek. Fourteen hardwood logs are laid out from the bank into the creek. Unlike the skids identified at Poverty Point, this ramp features logs running perpendicular to each other, orientated in either a north-east to south-west or north-west to south-east direction. The north-east to south-west logs run perpendicular to the shore, towards the creek. The north-west to south-east logs have been positioned under the more inland set of north-east to south- west logs. It appears that this has been done to add height to the inland section of the ramp, enabling sawn logs to better slide down into Seary's Creek. Along the north-western extent of this feature, the timber orientated north-west to south-east terminates with a stepped cut, allowing a log to sit securely underneath. The rafting ground may have been re-laid over time and surviving remnants may relate to Pettigrew's operation or a later timber- getting operation.  Heritage listing  The Cooloola Tramway was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 July 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The tramway is important in demonstrating the early expansion of Queensland's timber industry and the development of private railways in the State in the late nineteenth century. The Wide Bay-Burnett region was historically one of Queensland's most important timber producing regions. The remains of the Seary's Creek rafting ground and related corduroy crossing, and the Cooloola tramway provide rare surviving evidence of the earliest period of the timber industry in this region. The Cooloola tramway constructed by Pettigrew and Sim, in operation from 1873 to 1884, was the first major private railway in Queensland. Its success encouraged other timber-getting operations to use tramways to access remote timber resources and influenced the Queensland Government's construction of cheaper railways. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The ephemeral nature of extraction activities and regrowth of vegetation has left little apparent evidence of timber-getters' activities during the earliest period of the timber industry in Queensland. Archaeological investigation into the tramway has the potential to reveal important information that will contribute to our understanding of the development of Queensland's timber industry. Further investigations into the tramway may help determine the exact route, construction and operation of the tramway. Sub-surface investigations have previously revealed artefacts relating to the operation of the line. Archaeological investigation may also reveal material relating to the camps and settlement which were established in relation to the tramway. This material has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the organisation and domestic life of remote timber settlements that existed in late nineteenth century Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The tramway has strong aesthetic values derived from a picturesque setting incorporating beaches, inlets, creeks, scrubs and forests. Remaining evidence of the tramway set against the otherwise natural environment, elicits an appreciation of the tenacity required to construct the tramway in such a remote area and across such inhospitable terrain. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The tramway has a special association with William Pettigrew. Under the business partnership of Pettigrew and Sim, the tramway was constructed to supply timber to their Maryborough sawmill Dundathu. While the influence of Sim occurred mainly in the Maryborough area, Pettigrew made an important contribution to the development of the state's timber industry, and in turn the economic development of Queensland. Pettigrew, an important and influential pioneer of the Queensland timber industry, established Brisbane's first steam sawmill and conducted extensive timber-getting and processing operations between Brisbane and Maryborough during the colonial period.

On March 2, 2016, McEwan won the 2016 PBA-WBT H.H. Emir Cup (Doha, Qatar; $20,000 prize); however, because she accepted the eight handicap pins per game offered to female bowlers, she became ineligible to earn a PBA or World Bowling Tour title. McEwan captured her second PWBA Tour title at the PWBA Wichita Open on June 26, 2016. Her 823 in match play was the first 800 series by any player since the 2015 re-launch of the PWBA Tour. (broadcast July 5, 2016) On February 26, 2017, McEwan repeated as World Bowling Tour Women's Finals champion, defeating Liz Johnson in the final televised match to cash $20,000. On August 6, 2017, McEwan won her third PWBA Tour title at the Nationwide PWBA Rochester Open. In the same year, McEwan won a silver medal at The World Games 2017 in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. McEwan was unsuccessful in her bid for a third straight World Bowling Tour Women's Finals championship, falling to top seed Diana Zavjalova of Latvia in the final stepladder match held on November 19, 2017. She rebounded on December 3, 2017, winning the Women's All-Events gold medal at the 2017 World Bowling Championships in Las Vegas. McEwan won her fourth PWBA title on May 12, 2018 at the PWBA Fountain Valley Open (Fountain Valley, CA). She is one of three players (with Liz Johnson and Shannon O'Keefe) to have won at least one title every season since the re-launch of the PWBA Tour in 2015. She finished runner-up to Shannon O'Keefe for 2018 PWBA Player of the Year honors, also finishing second in championship round appearances (6) and third in Tour average (216.39). McEwan won the PBA International-WBT Thailand tournament on September 28, 2018, topping England's Stuart Williams in a two-game final to win ‡∏ø1,000,000 ($31,908 USD). Because McEwan accepted the eight pins per game handicap offered to female competitors, she was not credited with a PBA or WBT title. On June 23, 2019, McEwan won her fifth PWBA title and second career major at the U.S. Women's Open, defeating top seed Tannya Roumimper of Indonesia in the final match. For a second straight season, McEwan finished runner-up to Shannon O'Keefe for PWBA Player of the Year honors. =Training= In addition to bowling practice and gym work (cardio, foam rolling, stretching, and core), McEwan works on her mental game by working with a sports psychologist and by researching books and articles. Personal life From 2013 to 2018, Danielle dated PBA bowler Marshall Kent. The two initially met when both were members of Junior Team USA, but did not officially become a couple until representing Team USA at an event in Bangkok, Thailand. After five years of dating, McEwan and Kent went their separate ways for unspecified personal reasons.

Maria Desypri was born around 1892 in Athens to George Desypros and his wife. Maria was one of four daughters and lived for two years in Piraeus. She moved with her family to Larissa in her youth when her father was appointed director of a branch of the Greek National Bank. There she studied at the Arsakeion School of Larissa, graduating around 1907. Following the death of her father in 1915, the family returned to Athens. She received a certificate in French Studies in 1916 and a license for teaching French from the Ecclesiastical and Public Education Ministries in 1919. Svolou was active in the women's movement of Greece from a young age. She married law professor Alexandros Svolos in 1923. As secretary of the League for Women's Rights she advocated for the creation of night schools for women who worked and fought against prostitution. She campaigned and wrote on behalf of equality for the women of Greece. She was inspector of labor for the Ministry of Economics and used her position there to draw attention the poor working and housing conditions of impoverished working women. Svolou was involved in liberal politics from 1911 to 1936 and supported the peace movement. She was editor of the magazine Woman's Struggle and was exiled from Greece from 1936 to 1940 with her husband by dictator Ioannis Metaxas. Svolou was a leader of the liberal feminist movement but believed that gender equality could only be attained after fundamental societal change. She returned to Greece in 1940 and volunteered in the Greco-Italian War as a nurse. She later organised meals with the Red Cross for children during the German occupation of Greece. Svolou joined the EAM-ELAS resistance movement and was elected a member of the National Council, while her husband became chairman of the EAM-led Political Committee of National Liberation. Svolou sympathised with the Communists and was exiled again in 1948, during the Greek Civil War. Following her return she ran for the Parliament as a member of the United Democratic Left. She was elected twice and was a member of the party's Central Committee.

He is also known for producing Snowboard Academy Early life Rudy was born on 14 Nov 1968 in Chiswick, UK. Prior to PlanetHospital, Rudy's serial entrepreneur skills started at the age of 17 when he sold his first software business to a company that was eventually acquired by Corel Corp. just shortly after graduating high school. After a year at University of Calgary, another year at Simon Fraser and then at the University of Kwaazulu Natal, South Africa, Rudy returned to Canada to pursue his love of film. Rudy spent three years at various film distribution companies before finally starting his own production company, Millennium Multimedia. Millennium was responsible for several video games including PRIMORTALS and Boardlords, the first computer game about snowboarding. In 1996 Rudy Rupak produced Snowboard Academy for Colombia Tri- Star Entertainment, as well as She's Too Tall For Me. In 1996, Rudy's company Millennium Multimedia was mistaken for a company involved in Y2K initiatives and he seized upon the opportunity to create a software that would scan a PC's bios for Y2K compatibility. The company was taken public in 1997 under the name Planet City Software, trading symbol PINC. In 1998, Rudy created an online ecommerce software tool the ecommkit before exiting PINC to join American Apparel as its first CTO. While at American Apparel, Rudy created a call center named ContactStation in Thailand, followed by partnering with Stewart Title, to introduce title insurance to India. Contact Station was sold to Loxley Inc and the title insurance endeavour fizzled out but on a trip back from India, when his wife became sick and was taken to a hospital in Bangkok, Rudy realized that there was potential in sending foreigners to Thailand for medical treatment and the Medical Tourism company Planethospital was born. Filmography After spending three years in film distribution, Rudy started his own company called Millennium Multimedia Inc in 1995 to create content for television, internet, cd-rom and motion picture. Shortly thereafter, Rudy managed to get the interest of Columbia TriStar Home Video to co-finance Snowboard Academy which was a modest success on home video and HBO and continues to play on cable. Rudy's next movie was The Final Goal, for which he took a special thanks to credit, and the She's Too Tall For Me, for MGM Home Entertainment (now a division of Sony). After the failure of trying to make another Snowboarding movie called Boardlords, Rudy returned to the software world but plans to return to motion pictures again. PlanetHospital PlanetHospital was the world's first medical tourism company which Rudy started organically from his home while he was still CTO of American Apparel. The company grew organically from 2002 to 2005 and gradually accelerated its growth as the company was mentioned in several hundred media stories including Nightline, CNN, and Time Magazine. While PlanetHospital was germinating, Rudy was hired by an Indian video game production company, FxLabs, to lead the charge in animation and video game development. Rudy brokered a deal between FxLabs to create the ARCHIES videogame. In 2006, PlanetHospital became the first company to send a patient from the US to India for surrogacy. In late 2006 PlanetHospital sent the first gay patient to India for surrogacy and within two years surrogacy became a $100 million plus enterprise throughout the globe. In 2009, Rudy Rupak attempted to create an insurance product based on Medical Tourism, called DIASPORA, but the concept was deemed illegal by the California Department of Insurance and Rudy was forced to give up more shares to his investors who ultimately decided to take PlanetHospital public through a reverse merger with GlobalHealth Voyager (GLHV)(OTCBB: GLHV). GlobalHealth's board ordered PlanetHospital to focus on surrogacy only and forgo marketing other aspects of medical tourism, as aspect that Rudy was not too happy with, forcing Rudy to fight a long battle to get PlanetHospital back. Surrogacy controversy Rudy Rupak was the first person to send a foreign patient to India for surrogacy. It was a huge risk for all parties but it was successful. In 2007 Rudy sent around 25 couples to India for surrogacy, the first year he offered the service. Based on this success, Rudy introduced the first gay surrogacy in India and soon Commercial surrogacy in India became a billion dollar industry. Rudy eventually introduced surrogacy to Panama, Greece and eventually Mexico. After GLHV acquired PlanetHospital, the board requested that Rudy only focus on surrogacy, a decision he vehemently protested against and ultimately led a fight to get the company back.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/planet-hospital-says-bon- voyage-140000582.html By January 2013, GLHV officially settled out of court with Rudy Rupak to return PlanetHospital, however a month before, India had announced a ban on most surrogacy cases. This situation left PlanetHospital in a precarious position as over 20 of its clients paid for services but PlanetHospital's vendors were unable to perform services and most did not refund the moneys that were paid to them prior to the ban. Undaunted, PlanetHospital started to offer surrogacy in Mexico.http://www.montrealgazette.com/travel/Cancun+beautiful+beaches+home+Planet+Hospital+Mexican+surogacy+program+straight+clients/8947810/story.html After a huge legal expense to get his company back, and the ban on surrogacy in India that impacted close to 20 of his clients, Rudy worked with several vendors in Mexico and then attempted to purchase his own clinic in Cancun. He had hired a husband/wife legal team to assist with the challenges of surrogacy only to learn that they had started a competing company while being compensated by PlanetHospital. The team then went on to orchestrate a forced bankruptcy against PlanetHospital along with a campaign to destroy Rudy's reputation. In an attempt to clear his name, Rudy met with the FBI on his own accord to discuss the many complaints they had received and pleaded guilty to bribery but then withdrew his plea. While fighting the bankruptcy challenge in court Rudy launched a lawsuit against the legal team with the understanding that any settlement would go to pay the debtors who lost money due to PlanetHospital's surrogacy disaster. Since this situation, Rudy Rupak currently develops mobile apps for licensing including most recently. LetsBingo, the world's first livestream bingo game, an online comic book based on Victor Hugo's Les Miserables.

Photo taken by Carlos Cazurro Maureen Selwood (born 1946 in Dublin, Ireland) is an Irish-born American filmmaker and visual artist whose works employ simple line drawings, marriages between animation and live footage, digital projections and installations. She is a pioneer in the field of independent and experimental animation. She has received numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, and is the first animation artist to be awarded the Rome Prize in Visual Arts from the American Academy in Rome. Early life and education  Maureen Selwood was born in Dublin, Ireland to an Irish mother, Helene Neylon and a British father, John Leslie Selwood. She has a fraternal twin sister, Helen. Selwood's mother, the youngest of twelve, went to England along with many of her sisters to help with the war effort during WWII. Shortly after arriving in London Selwood's mother met John Leslie, whom she married a few months later. John first went to America in 1941 with the British Air Ministry to work in the administration with the Lend Lease program. When the war was over his wife and children emigrated to the United States. The family eventually settled in Washington D.C., where Selwood took art classes at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. As a high school student during John F. Kennedy's presidency, Selwood was invited to work with Eunice Shriver in her efforts to study models of mentorship through Camp Shriver for the founding of the Special Olympics in 1962 and 1963. As a young undergraduate at College of New Rochelle, Selwood worked as a volunteer for Daniel Berrigan in New York City, tutoring in Harlem. After graduating with her MFA from Tisch School of the Arts on a full scholarship, Selwood joined the independent animation community that was forming in NYC in the 1970s.  Career  During the years Selwood lived in New York City during the 1970s and 1980s she produced the independent animation films Odalisque, The Rug, This Is Just To Say and Pearls. Selwood is considered an integral part of the movement which evolved animation as a personal art form. In 1991, after Selwood moved to Los Angeles, Jules Engel, founder of the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts, invited Selwood to join the faculty. She went on to produce the films: Flying Circus: An Imagined Memoir; Hail Mary; Mistaken Identity; Drawing Lessons and A Modern Convenience. Flying Circus premiered at the Venice Film Festival: La Biennale di Venezia and is inspired by Parade, the 1917 ballet by Picasso, Satie and Cocteau. Selwood plays with a childhood memory and uses animation to illustrate episodes of shifting tensions inside a circus tent. In 1987, Selwood designed and directed animations for David Grubin Productions:The Colors of Hope, a documentary for Amnesty International about political prisoners in Argentina and I Started Early, based on the poetry of Emily Dickinson, for PBS's Poetry Everywhere (2007). In 2002, Selwood was the first animation artist to receive a Rome Prize Fellowship. As a Visual Arts Fellow at the American Academy of Rome, she created the installation, As The Veil Lifts, that went on to be exhibited at Frac Picardie in France alongside William Kentridge and Tabiamo. While in Rome Selwood collaborated with the poet James Galvin, who wrote the introduction for the book, Green Is For Privacy, a posthumous collaboration with her mother using her mother's drawings and writing about growing up with her mother's schizophrenia. As You Desire Me (2009) is a film and installation in response to the Iraq War. It uses surrealistic designed characters in real settings in the city of Rome and opened at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery at Barnsdall in Los Angeles. It was included in the Sharjah Biennial in the United Arab Emirates in 2013. Selwood has created digital projections in collaboration with Sardono Dance Theater and Jennifer Tipton for Rain Coloring Forest at REDCAT (2010) and for the Metropolitan Opera's production of the opera Werther, by Jules Massenet, with Wendall K. Harrington (2014). In 2015, Selwood's collaboration with the composer, David Rosenboom, How Much Better if Plymouth Rock Had Landed on the Pilgrims, (Section VII, Impression), screened at the Whitney Museum at its new location in downtown New York. The role of the composer in her work is an integral part of her process. She has collaborated with composers Michael Riesman for Odalisque and The Rug; Rhys Chatham for The Box; Martin Bresnik for This Is Just To Say; Miroslav Tadic for Flying Circus: An Imagined Memoir; Anna Oxygen for As You Desire Me; Jesse Gilbert and Tanya Haden for Drawing Lessons; and Archie Carey and Odeya Nini for A Modern Convenience. The poet Mark Strand performed the voice over for the film Drawing Lessons. Selwood has had solo drawing exhibits at Track 16 (2010) and the Rosamund Felsen Gallery (2015) titled Sounding the Note of A. Sounding the Note of A featured transfer prints on paper, as well as large sculptural pieces inspired by the balaclavas of the band Pussy Riot. The show explored themes of treason and the heroism of feminine resistance throughout history. Also in 2015, Selwood wrote and directed 29 Cross Examinations which premiered at Automata Performance Space in Chinatown. This was a hybrid performance piece featuring animation, movement, and text from the transcriptions of the trial of Joan of Arc. Selwood lives in Los Angeles and continues to teach at the California Institute of the Arts on the faculty of the School of Film/Video in the Experimental Animation program. Themes Selwood is known for developing a pictographic language of interiorized and unconscious drawings. Her work features drawing often in relation to photographic elements or live film footage. Her work is often rooted in art history, mythology, and women on the fringe. Her work deals with states of mutability in the human psyche, film noir, dada and surrealism. Her films have been influenced by and compared to Matisse's Fauvism, Cocteau, Fellini and Aldrich, as well as her longtime friend and mentor Jules Engel. She has been credited for helping to challenge conventional notions of women as objects of desire in art history.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1856 to 1861 and from 1861 to 1863. A friend and correspondent of John Stuart Mill, Holden was inspired by Mill to propose proportional representation to parliament in 1861. He is noted for being one of the first politicians in the world to do so.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/holden-george-kenyon-3781 Following his career as a Crown Prosecutor and solicitor, Holden became a trustee of the New South Wales Savings Bank (now Westpac), director of the Liverpool and London Fire and Life Insurance Company (now RSA), chairman of the National Schools Board, and president of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts. He was otherwise a pioneering environmentalist and a founding member of the Acclimatisation Society of New South Wales.E Wilson, The Wishing Tree: A Guide to Memorial Trees, Statues and Fountains in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Domain and Centennial Park, Sydney, Kangaroo Press, Sydney, 1992, p 30 Family He was born in Worcester, England to Adam Holden and Maria (n√©e Gillam). His daughter Mary Jane married another New South Wales politician and businessman, John Brown Watt; their third son was Ernest Alexander Stuart Watt (1874-1954), whose daughter Susan Gai Watt married into the Street dynasty by wedding Sir Laurence Whistler Street. Holden died at Darlinghurst in 1874. Career Holden studied law and became a solicitor, migrating to New South Wales in 1831. He was private secretary to Governor Sir Richard Bourke during his term (1831-37), and was also a stipendiary magistrate at Campbelltown. In 1837 he became Crown Prosecutor in the Quarter Sessions, and in 1838 he began private practice as a solicitor. He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1856 to 1861 and from 1861 to 1863. Holden was inspired by John Stuart Mill to advocate a proportional representation electoral system using the Hare quota, as had been recommended by Mill in their letters. He made the proposal to parliament in 1861. An active member of parliament, Holden was secretary of the Law Commission between 1848 and 1850.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/holden-george-kenyon-3781 In 1849, Holden was appointed to the Board of National Education, remaining until 1867 when it was replaced by the Council of Education. During his tenure, Holden also served as the chairman of the National Schools Board until 1865. His interest in education, as with land title reform, was likely rooted in his time as Governor Bourke's private secretary, as Bourke had been an advocate of public education in New South Wales.https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/holden_george_kenyon Environmentalism In 1861, he was a founding member of the Acclimatisation Society of New South Wales. The Society's aim was the introduction, acclimatisation and domestication of 'useful or ornamental' birds, fish, insects, vegetables and other exotic species. Among other species discussed and introduced by the Society during the 1860s were alpacas, sunflowers, watercress and pheasants. The society was also active in importing Australian species into New South Wales and Sydney, including Murray cod in 1864. During this period, the Acclimatisation Society also erected a number of cages in the Sydney Botanic Gardens in which they kept a collection of introduced birds such as pheasants, blackbirds and thrushes, which acted as part storage aviary and part exotic zoo.E Wilson, The Wishing Tree: A Guide to Memorial Trees, Statues and Fountains in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Domain and Centennial Park, Sydney, Kangaroo Press, Sydney, 1992, p 30 References Category:1808 births Category:1874 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council Category:19th-century Australian politicians ","title":"George Holden (politician)"},{"id":"48419489","text":"High School Story is a mobile device video game developed and published by Pixelberry Studios in September 2013. It is currently available on iPhone and iPod formats, and it can be purchased through the App Store or the Google Store on Android. The game serves as a sister story to Surviving High School, as some recognizable characters from the latter (Autumn, Wes, Owen, Kimi) are either included into or simply make appearances in the former. On June 4, 2018, Pixelberry Studios announced that it would be ending support for the game in the following weeks. Gameplay High School Story is a choice-based simulation game. The player is a student attempting to build their own high school, with no given name. In order to build up his/her school, the player must complete quests to progress through the story, obtain Classmates (who are categorized by their cliques), Hangouts (where Students can...well, 'hangout'), and Land Plots (to put Hangouts and other various Decorations). The player is able to not only customize his/her appearance, but also the appearances of all other students in the school, excluding main characters created by the game (Autumn, Payton, Julian, etc.). In order to get Hangouts and Land Plots, the player needs to acquire Coins and Rings. The player receives coins and rings from finishing quests, though they can also purchase coins and rings with real money in the Store. Coins can also be collected from Hangouts, as each student produces a certain amount of coins per hour depending on their type and level. In the beginning of the game, the player is able to choose their gender and type, though they are only able to choose from three particular cliques: Nerd, Prep, or Jock. There are various types in High School Story which range from basic types such as a Jock, Nerd or Prep to \\"combined\\" classmates like Cheerleader, Gamer or Student Government, and the player can gain other students through two different methods: They can either buy students from Admissions using Coins or Rings, or they can try \\"Partying\\" to get the type of student they want. Partying is a game mechanic which allows players to gain special classmates without having to pay directly for them in Admissions. All parties take place in Party Central, which can be found in the Buildings tab for 1000 coins and is unlocked after a certain quest is completed. You may only have one Party Central and therefore can only send two classmates to party at a time. Plot The game begins with the MC (Main Character) in an empty lot and is first introduced to the character Autumn Brooks. After a basic tutorial on the game, Autumn confides in the MC that she is miserable at a future rival school called Hearst High and wishes to attend the MC's school. They immediately receive a text from the main enemy, Max Warren, son of the principal of Hearst (or Kara Sinclair, head cheerleader, depending on the gender of the MC) and are threatened stating that unless their school contains fifteen students, it will be closed down. After an introduction to Autumn's friend, Julian, the two characters try to convince him to transfer to the MC's school from Hearst due to him not being able to play because his coach benches him for Max. To their dismay, he turns them down because his being at the school is the only opportunity to be recognized by football scouts, as he is not entirely good in school or other activities. But when the MC and Autumn show up at a Hearst football game, Julian is banned from playing the game for the remaining season as a result of fighting Max. Seeing the capability of the MC's school, Julian joins the school because he sees there is teamwork, a quality that Hearst now woefully lacks. To celebrate, they throw a party to get other students to come to their school with the help of Hearst student, Payton. The party is a success, but Payton forgets about throwing a party for Mia, Max's sister, and she and Kara swear to make her life awful in Hearst. Payton, feeling terrible, is convinced by Autumn to join the MC's school. She is initially sad because she is dumped by her boyfriend, but is happy again as she is able to date again. Hearst challenges the MC and their school to a homecoming game. If they win, Autumn will be able to transfer to the MC's school. They are warned by an anonymous text messenger that Hearst has a plan to steal their playbook plans. Unfortunately, the text message comes to pass - Hearst uses a quadrocopter with a camera to view their plan and steal it. Julian manages to take it down in time but Max tells him that the footage has been streaming live and they have all that they need. They are able to create a new playbook, but as they practice it, Julian kicks the football to the direction of Payton's float and they have an argument with each other, leaving the MC to solve it. They work their differences out and Julian and the football team win the homecoming game. Owing to the success of the homecoming game, Autumn finally gets to transfer to the MC's school. The MC is still curious about the quadrocopter that Max used to spy on them. Autumn tells her the only person who seems to know how to create one but to talk to him, the MC is required to go undercover. The MC is almost caught but barely escapes. Upon arrival, they meet Nishan, nerdy inventor and scientist. The Mc tries to convince him to transfer schools but he declines stating that Hearst has a better academic program and a robotics club.  Main Characters  * Your Character - Your Character is the main protagonist who is a main part in building the school. After being harassed by Max and Kara, Your Character dreams of making their new school a place where everyone is accepting of everyone. It is unknown what Your Character's life was like outside of school, but the player is allowed to make choices on what Your Character says to others, determining their personality. Your Character's looks and gender are customizable, and the player can also choose whether Your Character is a nerd, prep, or a jock. * Autumn Brooks - Autumn is Your Character's best friend and is very loyal to the new school. Although her dad wouldn't allow her to switch schools in the beginning, the school beating Hearst High at football ultimately made him change his mind, and Autumn ended up attending the school. Autumn's mom, who Autumn was very close to, died three years prior to the game, when Autumn was only twelve. Autumn's father eventually remarries a woman named Charlotte. Autumn wasn't fond at the idea of a new step-mom at first, but after spending time with Charlotte, Autumn accepts her into the family. Autumn had her first kiss with Wes in the previous game, Surviving High School, and the pair still care for each other from time to time. It has been strongly hinted that Autumn harbors feelings for Julian and that he also has feelings for her too. It is up to the player to decide whether Autumn dates him or not. Autumn is an artist type. * Payton - Payton is a cheerful girl who attends the new school after she forgets to throw a party for Mia, causing her to be a social outcast at Hearst High until Your Character invites her to the school. Payton is shown to love partying and shopping. Payton was revealed to be adopted and due to this, she once adopted a bunch of animals so that they could have a home like her. When she first transferred to the new school, she appeared to have a crush on Julian and was jealous of him and Autumn's relationship, but she moves on unless the player puts Payton and Julian in a relationship. Later, Payton is hinted to have a crush on Ezra. Payton is a prep type. * Julian - Julian formerly was a student at Heart High until Autumn and Your Character convinced him to attend the new school. Julian decided to transfer because the football coach at Heart High would always put him on the bench and never let him play and he wanted somewhere where he would actually be given a fair chance. Julian has anger issues and has admitted that he used to be a bully when he was at Hearst High, but is now reformed. Julian has mentioned that his father would always tell him that he's only a \\"dumb jock\\" and that's sports is the only thing he'd ever be good at, hinting that Julian possibly has an abusive home life. Julian used to have trouble maintaining good grades due to the words of his father, but after receiving support from his friends, he was able to get good grades. Julian appears to be quite the heartthrob and has been crushed on by Payton, Kallie, and Autumn, however, it is only hinted that he returns feelings for Autumn. It is up to the player to decide who he actually dates. Julian has a younger sister named Hope who he always makes sure to defend. Julian is a jock type. * Nishan - Nishan is a nerd type who eventually attends Your Character's school. At Hearst High, Nishan originally would do favors for Max, which prevented him from getting bullied. Nishan eventually realizes that he should be going to a school where people accept him for who he is and not for what he does for others. Nishan is best friends with Sakura and is hinted to have feelings for her, but it is up to the player on whether they get together. Nishan is shown to be very interested in science and robotics. * Mia Warren - Mia originally attended Hearst High and is the sister of one of the football players there, Max. Mia was best friends with Kara at first, but ends up betraying her and Max by sending Your Character anonymous texts that reveal all of the pranks that Max and Kara were going to pull on the new school. When this is revealed, Mia plans on attending the new school despite her father's wishes. It is revealed that Mia's mother had remarried and Mia currently lives with her dad, who is implied to be very controlling and abusive. Mia formerly had an eating disorder before she attended the new school, but it developed again after taking her cheerleading photos for the yearbook and Julian absentmindedly called her \\"heavy\\". Mia ended up in the hospital for this and begins to see a psychotherapist to help her keep her eating disorder in control, even though she still struggles with it. Mia reveals later on that her controlling home life was a factor in her eating disorder because her food intake was the only thing she could control. Mia is revealed to like girls (although the player can pair her with boys too) and it is hinted that she has feelings for her best friend, Katherine. Mia is a cheerleader type. * Wes - Wes is a sketchy character who originally attends Hearst High. Most people do not trust Wes, except for Autumn, who had shared a kiss with him in the former game, Surviving High School. Wes was being raised by his older brother, Matt, until Matt stole money from his boss to support him and Wes, which led to Matt being arrested. Wes visits his brother every week and plans on going to college for his brother. Wes is shown to always know everyone's secrets. Due to Wes's past, he is usually suspicious of everyone he meets and believes that everyone has a dark side. Koh is shown to be flirting with Wes occasionally, even kissing him once, and it is hinted that Wes and Sakura have feelings for each other sometimes. Wes is a slacker type. * Sakura - Sakura is the best friend of Nishan. After Nishan leaves Hearst High without her, as well as a lot of unfinished projects they were working on together, Sakura is upset and doesn't talk to him for a long time. Your Character eventually helps them make up and Sakura transfers to Hearst High. It is strongly hinted that Nishan and Sakura have feelings for each other, and it is also hinted that she may have feelings for Wes as well, but the player chooses who she ends up with. Sakura is the gamer type and it is shown that gaming helps her heavily in real life, like finding games to help her with school subjects. Sakura is revealed to hate art because it is the only things that she can't use gaming to help her with. Sakura is shown to be very competitive towards others. * Koh - Koh is a troublemaker who joins the new school because she ended up getting expelled from all of her other ones. It is revealed that her ex-boyfriend, Razor, has been trying to get her to quit school to join his company by doing things such as vandalizing, which is the reason why she's been getting expelled. Nishan and Sakura end up helping her by tricking him into hacking the school website, which was protected by an upgraded antivirus software that allowed them to hack into his computer and get all the evidence of his crimes and an antivirus from the file-deletion virus he created. Koh's mother left her when she was younger and she currently lives with her grandmother. Koh is shown to be very similar to Wes and flirts with him sometimes, even ending up kissing him once. Koh is a slacker type. * Ezra - Ezra is a musician type who is also quite the ladies man. Ezra is revealed to have major trust issues after his ex-girlfriend, Lena, cheated on him with his ex-best friend, Jack Carver. Ezra eventually joins Your Character's school and starts a band with Your Character, Payton and Julian. Although Ezra flirts with just about every girl he meets, he appears to flirt with Payton the most, hinting that he has romantic feelings for her. * Katherine - Katherine originally attended Athena Academy, but eventually ended up joining the new school. Katherine is best friends with Brigette, Mia's cousin, but ended up kissing her boyfriend, Zero, while he was dating Brigette. Brigette never found out, but \\"Pandora\\" knew and used this to blackmail Katherine into attempting to lure Nishan and Sakura away from the school so that the school's chances of getting funds in the academic tests would be ruined. When \\"Pandora\\" was revealed to be Katherine's best friend, Lacey, Katherine begins to dislike Lacey and Lacey begins to pick on her daily, leading to Katherine switching to Your Character's school. Katherine is now best friends with Mia and it is hinted that Katherine likes girls, specifically Mia. Katherine is an emo type. * Kallie - Kallie was homeschooled by her mother since she was a child, but ends up going to Your Character's school to attend the English class only. Kallie makes friends with some of her classmates, including Your Character, Payton and Julian, who encouraged her to enroll in the new school. Kallie is shown to be very good at vocabulary. Due to being homeschooled for so long, she has a harder time fitting in and making friends. Kallie has a sister named Melissa, but it appears to be a touchy subject for Kallie for unknown reasons. Kallie is introduced in the Extra Credit quests and is shown to have feelings for Julian. Julian doesn't notice her feelings and views her more as a little sister and is very protective over her. Kallie had a best friend named Connor when she was younger, but he moved away. He eventually visits her again and Julian is immediately protective over her, but soon realizes that Connor only has good intentions with Kallie and isn't a bad person. Kallie is a writer type.  Reception  Google Play and the iOS App Store both gave it a 4.5 out of 5.

Tromara family traces their origin in Souli, having settled in the area after the atrocities of Ali Pasha. Tromara pursued his elementary studies in nearby Kor√ß√´, and higher ones in Greece. He started working after then as a pharmacist in Kor√ß√´, but due to economical difficulties and political oppression from the Ottomans decided to emigrate in US, quite common at the time for the Orthodox community members. Tromara settled in Boston, Massachusetts in 1906 and was immediately involved in the patriotic circles of the Albanian community there. In 1907, he became secretary of the Besa-Bes√´n society in Boston. In 1915, he became General Secretary of Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America. A year later, he was elected acting chairman of Vatra; in 1917 he co-founded the \\"Vatra Musical Band\\", and organized the Congress of Diaspora for raising funds in support of the Vatra's delegation (part of which Tramara was) in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Meanwhile, his mother had been executed in his native village by the Greek andarts of Zografos. In 1920, he returned to Albania where he founded the \\"Federata e Madhe Atdheu\\" (Homeland Wide Federation) in Vlor√´ together with Avni Rustemi, Luigj Gurakuqi, Ahmet Dakli, and Bedri Pejani. In 1923, as Prefect of Gjirokast√´r Prefecture, Tromara reported constantly on the attempts of the Greek government to exchange the Cham Albanian population and send them to Turkey. Through the sub-prefecture of Chameria which was under his jurisdiction, he tried convincing the Cham population to stay and not leave.

Meanwhile, a political court in Albanian sentenced him to 15 years of imprisonment. After the failed assassination attempt on King Zog in 1933, he settled in Paris, still being one of the most active Albanian political emigrants.

He was a founding member of the Balli Komb√´tar political fraction. During 1942-1943 he served as Prefect of Kor√ß√´. In 1943, following his resignation from Balli Komb√´tar, he joined the Cabinet of Rexhep Mitrovica as Minister of Culture. With the end of World War II and the rise of the Communists in power, he was arrested and prosecuted in the Special Court of 1945. The court sentenced him to death on 13 April 1945. Tromara was executed by the Communists in 1945 at the age of 63. Tromara is the author of an Albanian patriotic song, Sa te rroj√´ gjith√´sia (As long as the universe lives), quite known between Albanians though the name of the author was hidden during communism.

A progressive Democrat for that time and place, he was \\"an almost lone dissenter in the state's 'massive resistance' policies\\" in its fight against racial integration. In the 1950s Wroten consistently spoke and voted against the Mississippi legislature's maneuvers to divert state monies to the Citizens' Councils. Out of 122 representatives, only he and Karl Wiesenburg of Pascagoula voted nay in Governor Ross Barnett's special session called to stop James Meredith from enrolling at the University of Mississippi, which saw the Ole Miss riot of 1962. He was defeated in his bid for re-election the next year. He went on to be elected chairman of the Washington County Democratic Executive Committee, a racially integrated political committee which announced its pro-integration platform at the 1968 Mississippi State Democratic convention. At this time Wroten's party affiliation was Loyalist Democrat. He and a delegation of the executive committee went to the National Democratic Convention in Chicago, > and in a credentials fight we succeeded in prevailing over the old guard > conservative delegation composed of the governor and others from > Mississippi, and we were the ones who were seated.

He represented Vicksburg and the surrounding area in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1952 to 1977. Believing education to be the key to transforming Mississippi, he rose to become Chairman of the House Education Committee.

He was instrumental in the establishment of the first public television station in Mississippi. As an attorney, Rogers also had the distinction of appearing for the people of Mississippi before the United States Supreme Court in November 1965.

Hawkes is considered an influential part of the Australian Feminist art Movement, which was centred predominately in Melbourne during the mid 1970s. Hawkes' work is broad in its scope, including artists, feminists, sportspeople, public figures and candid street-photographs. She is especially noted for her 1976 photo essay Our Mums and Us, which featured her coterie of female friends and their mothers, among them the writer Helen Garner, in a typological style. Early life and education Hawkes was born in Abbotsford, Victoria, in 1946 and educated at University High School. She is self-taught, having never formally studied photography. Upon returning to Australia from the United States in the early 1970s, Hawkes, who was working as a journalist for the magazine The Digger (alternative magazine) took up photography to enhance her journalistic work.

Dilatancy is the volume change observed in granular materials when they are subjected to shear deformations. This effect was first described scientifically by Osborne Reynolds in 1885/1886 Reynolds, O., \\"Experiments showing dilatancy, a property of granular material, possibly connected with gravitation,\\" Proc. Royal Institution of Great Britain, Read, February 12, 1886. and is also known as Reynolds dilatancy. Unlike most other solid materials, the tendency of a compacted dense granular material is to dilate (expand in volume) as it is sheared. This occurs because the grains in a compacted state are interlocking and therefore do not have the freedom to move around one another. When stressed, a lever motion occurs between neighboring grains, which produces a bulk expansion of the material. On the other hand, when a granular material starts in a very loose state it may continuously compact instead of dilating under shear. A sample of a material is called dilative if its volume increases with increasing shear and contractive if the volume decreases with increasing shear.Casagrande, A., Hirschfeld, R. C., & Poulos, S. J. (1964). Fourth Report: Investigation of Stress-Deformation and Strength Characteristics of Compacted Clays. HARVARD UNIV CAMBRIDGE MA SOIL MECHANICS LAB.Poulos, S. J. (1971). The stress-strain curves of soils. Geotechnical Engineers Incorporated. Chicago. Dilatancy is a common feature of the soils and sands. Its effect can be seen when the wet sand around the foot of a person walking on beach appears to dry up. The deformation caused by the foot expands the sand under it and the water in the sand moves to fill the new space between the grains. Reynolds dilatancy concept has been brought into the field of geotechnical engineers by Peter Walter Rowe,Rowe, P. W., \\"The stress-dilatancy relation for static equilibrium of an assembly of particles in contact,\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society A, 1962. and is a part of the broader topic of soil mechanics.  Phenomenon  Dilatancy of a sample of dense sand in simple shear. The phenomenon of dilatancy can be observed in a drained simple shear test on a sample of dense sand. In the initial stage of deformation, the volumetric strain decreases as the shear strain increases. But as the stress approaches its peak value, the volumetric strain starts to increase. After some more shear, the soil sample has a larger volume than when the test was started. The amount of dilation depends strongly on the initial density of the soil. In general, the denser the soil, the greater the amount of volume expansion under shear. It has also been observed that the angle of internal friction decreases as the effective normal stress is decreased.Houlsby, G. T. How the dilatancy of soils affects their behaviour. University of Oxford, Department of Engineering Science, 1991.http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/civil/publications/reports-1/ouel_1888_91.pdf The relationship between dilation and internal friction is typically illustrated by the sawtooth model of dilatancy where the angle of dilation is analogous to the angle made by the teeth to the horizontal. Such a model can be used to infer that the observed friction angle is equal to the dilation angle plus the friction angle for zero dilation.  Why is dilatancy important?  Because of dilatancy, the angle of friction increases as the confinement increases until it reaches a peak value. After the peak strength of the soil is mobilized the angle of friction abruptly decreases. As a result, geotechnical engineering of slopes, footings, tunnels, and piles in such soils have to consider the potential decrease in strength after the soil strength reaches this peak value. Poorly / uniformly graded silt with trace sand to sandy that is non- plastic can be associated with challenges during construction, even when they are hard. These materials often appear to be granular because the silt is so coarse and thus may be described as dense to very dense. Vertical excavations below the water table in these soil types exhibit short term stability, similar to many dense sandy soil deposits, in part due to matric suction. However, as shearing of the soil occurs in the active wedge due to gravity forces, strength is lost and the rate of failure accelerates. This can be exacerbated by hydrostatic forces developing at the location(s) where water (drains to and) collects in tension cracks in or near the back of the active wedge. Generally retrogressive spalling manifests, often accompanied by piping / internal erosion. The use of appropriate filters is critical to managing these materials; a preferred filter might be a #4 sized clear gravel / coarse- grained sand as a commercial aggregate which is generally readily available. Some non- woven filter fabrics are also suitable. As with all filters, D15 and D50 compatibility criteria should be checked.

Washington had a background in environmental science prior to authoring the work; Cook, educated in physics, founded (2007) the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of global warming. The book was first published in hardcover and paperback formats in 2011 by Earthscan, a division of Routledge. The book presents an in-depth analysis and refutation of climate-change denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. Washington and Cook use social-science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate-change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology. The book traces financial support for climate- change denial to the fossil-fuel industry, asserting that its companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians have a tendency to use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed. For his research on the book, and efforts in communicating the essence of climate-change science to the general public, John Cook won the 2011 Australian Museum Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge. Climate Change Denial received a positive reception in reviews from publications including: The Ecologist, ECOS magazine, academic journal Natures Sciences Soci√©t√©s, the journal Education published by the New South Wales Teachers Federation. Background The book was coauthored by Australian environmental science researchers Haydn Washington and John Cook. Washington worked for over 30 years as an environmental scientist prior to writing the book. His previously published books on the subject of environmental science include: Ecosolutions (1991), A Sense of Wonder (2002), and The Wilderness Knot (2009). In 2015, Washington was a Visiting Fellow with the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of New South Wales. Cook's education includes a background in physics. Prior to his work on the book, Cook founded the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of climate change. He placed on the site the most common assertions made by individuals arguing against the scientific consensus for climate change, with evidence to refute each point they made. After the publication of Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another book on the subject, Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1 ‚Äì The Physical Climate (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland. Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand was first published in 2011 by Earthscan, a division of Routledge. Both hardcover and paperback editions were released in April 2011. It was released the same year by the publisher in an electronic book format. A second eBook release was published by Routledge in 2012. The book was made available via Kindle by Amazon.com in May 2013. Contents summary Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand presents a detailed analysis and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism of the values of climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors discuss the broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its occurrence appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded from an individual to wider society, present themselves as a form of disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue. The book identifies a corporate underpinning influencing public opinion by way of companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words as a form of spin and propaganda, in order to act as if they are going to do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial ‚Äî within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed. Reception Australian Museum in 2011 The book's coauthor John Cook won the 2011 Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge, awarded by the New South Wales Government as part of the Australian Museum Eureka Prizes, and was honoured for his role in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public. Director of the University of Queensland Global Change Institute, Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, cited Cook's research and authorship of Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand as the rationale behind him winning the award. The Ecologist reviewed the book and described it as: \\"well researched and painstakingly footnoted\\". The review concluded: Climate Change Denial is a wise and timely book. ... It deserves an audience\\". Writing for ECOS magazine, Mary-Lou Considine wrote that the book \\"dissects objections to the peer- reviewed science\\" in \\"forensic detail\\". Considine recommended the book for those who had previously visited the website Skeptical Science and subsequently wanted to learn more about the wider topic discussed on the site. In a review of the book by the academic journal Natures Sciences Soci√©t√©s, the authors' thesis was praised for its ability to bring reason to their analysis: \\"This book shows how we can break through denial, accept reality, and thus solve the climate crisis\\". Natures Sciences Soci√©t√©s recommended the work for multiple stakeholders, concluding: \\"It will engage scientists, university students, climate change activists as well as the general public seeking to roll back denial and act\\". Janine Kitson reviewed the book for the journal Education, a publication of the New South Wales Teachers Federation. Kitson described the work as timely and important within the context of a need for the public to act before a point of no return: \\"This is a crucial book to read before runaway climate change is truly beyond our control\\". Her review concluded: \\"One can only hope that this book will be read by climate deniers so we can start the challenging journey to an ecologically sustainable future\\".

History The band first got together in 2010, although they did not play publicly until 2011. Frontman Andrei GƒÉlu»õ, who had previously won the Romanian talent show Megastar on Prima TV, enlisted the help of a full band, including former members of the Romanian band Thunderstorm, to get the band going. In 2012 the band released their self-titled debut album to a warm reception and steadily built their reputation in Romania. As a result of the success of Goodbye to Gravity, the band were signed to Universal Music's Romanian branch, and played at festivals in countries such as Germany, Portugal and Italy. In 2015 the band set to work on their sophomore effort, with more sci-fi themes to their music. The album was announced as Mantras of War with a release date of 30 October. To celebrate the release, the group announced a free show at the Colectiv nightclub in Bucharest. =Colectiv nightclub fire= At their Mantras of War release party on 30 October 2015 at Colectiv nightclub in Bucharest, the band's firework display set a deadly fire, greatly accelerated by polyurethane foam used in the club to dampen sound waves. 64 people died, while many more were hospitalised. Vocalist Andrei GƒÉlu»õ, bassist Alex Pascu, and drummer Bogdan Enache (also known as Bogdan Lavinius) were hospitalised with injuries, and guitarists Vlad »öelea and Mihai Alexandru were killed in the blaze. Enache died on 8 November, while being transported to a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. Pascu, who was moved to a hospital in Paris, France, and GƒÉlu»õ's girlfriend MƒÉdƒÉlina Strungaru both died on 11 November. Universal Music Romania, whom the band were signed to, agreed to donate all proceeds from sales of Mantras of War to help the victims of the fire.Universal Music Romania donates proceedings from sale of albums by Goodbye to Gravity and Up To Eleven, Agerpress.ro, 5 November 2015; retrieved 9 November 2015.

About 600 African American troops from the 96th Battalion, US Army Corps of Engineers, were stationed at a base outside of Townsville called Kelso Field. They were a labour battalion and their main job was to build bridges and barracks. The rumour that a black sergeant had died at the hands of a white superior resulted in the troops of A and C company mutinying. On May 22, 1942, aiming to kill their commander, Captain Francis Williams of Columbus, Georgia, the black troopers began firing machine guns at the tents of white officers, resulting in an eight hour siege. At least one person was killed and dozens severely injured, and Australian Army soldiers were called in to roadblock the rioters. American journalist Robert Sherrod wrote a report on the mutiny but it was suppressed, as future US president Lyndon B. Johnson, then a young congressman, was visiting Townsville at the time. The mutiny was revealed by a historian in 2012.

Boyd exhibited publicly between 1874 and 1932. She showed with the Victorian Artists Society, the Centennial International Exhibition 1888 (Melbourne), the Royal Academy of Arts (London), and in a joint show with her husband at Como House in Melbourne in 1902, amongst other venues. Over one hundred pounds worth of artworks were sold at the 1902 exhibition and commissions were given for further copies of works sold.Table Talk, Melbourne, 28 August 1902, p. 29 She had a talent for watercolour landscapes, although she painted in both watercolour and oil, and a mix of interiors, figures, portraits, still life and flower studies. She is part of the Boyd Artistic Dynasty, an Australian artist family, which began with Emma and her husband Arthur and the work that they created that influenced their children and grandchildren to pursue artistic careers.  Early Life  Emma Minnie Boyd, nee √† Beckett was born in Melbourne in on 23 November 1858. She was the second child of her parents William Arthur √† Beckett and Emma Mills √† Beckett. Her mother Emma Mills √† Beckett was the Heiress of the John Mills fortune. Emma Minnie Boyd was known by her second name ‚ÄúMinnie‚Äù so as not to be confused for her mother. Partly thanks to her mother‚Äôs fortune, Emma Minnie Boyd lived a very comfortable life with her family, growing up in Melbourne. From an early age she showed an interest in the arts, painting and drawing particularly. Her family would indulge her by posing for her early portraits. Her parents were well off and supporters of the arts. They encouraged her talents and were able to support her and give her a happy and privileged childhood. She studied at the National Gallery of Victoria School and exhibited regularly while studying.  Marriage Interior with Figures, The Grange She married Arthur Merric Boyd in 1886. He was born in New Zealand in 1862 and was the son of a military officer,Associated families to residents of Upper Beaconsfield and surrounding areas. he was also an aspiring artist. His family moved to Melbourne in the mid-1870s where Arthur Merric Boyd began to train as a painter but without the same familial support that his wife received from her family. They met while they were at art school together. It was fortunate for Arthur Merric Boyd that he married into a wealthy family. His own parents would have been unable to support him as making a good living as an artist, especially with his own family to look after, would have been difficult. The √† Beckett's were able to give the young couple and their children the means to pursue careers in the arts. Together Arthur and Minnie had five children, Gilbert born 1886, who was tragically killed in a fall from a horse in 1896, Merric Boyd born 1888, Penleigh Boyd 1890, Martin Boyd in 1893, and her youngest and only daughter Helen 1903. All her children were involved in the arts, including Helen who became a painter. After her marriage Emma Minnie and Arthur Merric Boyd continued to receive support from her family. They moved into one of the family homes, The Grange, where they began raising their own family. As a woman who was well off, she had nannies to help her with the children and servants to help her with the house, duties expected of women in this time. This allowed her to continue to work even after starting a family. Career A Lassie Yet Emma Minnie Boyd was a prolific painter and exhibited her work frequently. She was one of the more versatile Australian artists and her work was varied. She was a contemporary of Artists like James Conder, Arthur Streeton, Frederick McCubbin and Tom Roberts and her work was exhibited alongside theirs. Both the Boyd‚Äôs were acquainted with the artists who worked at the Heidelberg School but family and circumstance prevented them from also taking part. As a newly married couple they would be expected to set up house together and see about starting a family, it would not have been appropriate for them to be gallivanting across the countryside with a group of other painters. Because of this it is possible that both their careers could have suffered without the professional relationships and recognition the Heidelberg school achieved with the public. Emma Minnie Boyd also worked with Louis Buvelot, with whom she shared a facility for landscape watercolour ‚Äúand a cautious tonal impressionism, with its persistent echoes of the Dutch school.‚Äù In 1890 the Boyd‚Äôs went to Europe to work, with their two young sons, where their work was shown at the Royal academy of the Arts, Boyd made several works during her time there. she was a religious woman and painted many of her social conscience works overseas. The loss of family investments in the crash of the Melbourne land boom brought Emma and her husband back to Melbourne, where she taught art students in her city studio. Her work Interior with figures, The Grange 1875 shows her talent for watercolour. Painted when she was just sixteen it is a snapshot of Australian life. The large bay window is shaded by galvanised iron typical of Australian homes of the period. The interior is relaxed, with the window opened. A young Man sits on the window ledge not quite inside or outside the room, his companion, a young woman is seated inside, sewing. There is a relaxed atmosphere with the messy sewing box and two cats playing by a chair to the left of the painting. The spatial relationship of the kittens imitates that of the man and the woman. It comments on the relaxed atmosphere and social obligations that were a part of colonial society in Australia. Even during Victorian times social standards and decorum was not as strict as it was in Britain. She painted many watercolour landscape paintings of the Australian Bush; these works were popular with the public because the Australian landscape is quite unique to Australia and it represented a sense of national pride leading up to federation in 1901. She died at Sandringham on 13 September 1936, survived by two of her sons and her daughter. Legacy For many years she has been documented only as the mother of significant artists Penleigh Boyd and Merric Boyd and novelist Martin Boyd (her daughter Helen Read was also a prolific artist), and grandmother of Arthur Boyd and Guy Boyd but she was one of the most prolific and consistent women artists of her generation in Melbourne, with a career that significantly outlasted that of Jane Sutherland, for example. Emma Minnie Boyd's art was shown in its own right as works of historical and curatorial merit in the 1992‚Äì1993 touring exhibition Completing the Picture: Women Artists and the Heidelberg School, at the Heide Museum of Modern Art and elsewhere, and in a retrospective in 2004 at the Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery.

Life  He was born in Tiba, a manor-house near Levoƒça. Sklen√°r entered the Jesuits as a novice in 1764 and become a doctor of philosophy. He worked in Levoƒça, Trnava, Pre≈°ov and Ko≈°ice. After the abolition of the Jesuit order, he worked as a professor of rhetoric and deputy director at main royal grammar school in Pressburg (today's Bratislava). A part of Sklen√°r's works are Latin odes and occasional speeches related to his pedagogic position. In the 1770s, he already become more known among scientists.

Sklen√°r, together with Juraj Pap√°nek, Juraj F√°ndly and Samuel Timon created the first scientific works about the earliest history of Slovaks. Slovak enlightenment historians already paid attention to Great Moravia and the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius, but did not adopt yet a deciding position. In 1784, Sklen√°r published his most important work Vetustissimus magnae Moraviae situs et primus in eam Hungarorum ingressus et incursus, geographice, historice, critice descriptus. He tried to separate the history of Great Moravia from the Slovak history and proposed the location of its center to Sremska Mitrovica.

In 2006, she and a research partner discovered a species thought to be extinct and in 2010, she was awarded the National Geographic's \\"Young Explorer Grant\\". She became the first Bolivian scientist to win a L'Or√©al-UNESCO Fellowship for Women in Science in 2012 and in 2013 was named by the BBC as one of the top ten Latin American women of science. Biography Kathrin Barboza Marquez was born in 1983 and grew up in Cochabamba, Bolivia. She is the only daughter of Mario Pablo Barboza C√©spedes and Mar√≠a Alcira M√°rquez Zurita. She attended the Universidad Mayor de San Sim√≥n (UMSS) and studied at the Center of Biodiversity and Genetics. In 2003, Barboza Marquez was studying biology with a focus on conservation. As punishment for losing a bet with friends, she had to attend a lecture on bats by Dr. Luis Aguirre, a visiting professor and bat expert. Little did Barboza Marquez know that it would change the course of her life and career. ‚ÄúI went and was immediately hooked by everything I heard,‚Äù she remembers with a smile. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how important they [bats] were, that there were so many variations, that they ate so many things.‚Äù ‚ÄúGenerally, people have negative perceptions about bats: that they are bad luck, that they suck blood, that they‚Äôre a menace, but that‚Äôs not true,‚Äù Kathrin shares. After attending the lecture, Barboza Marquez decided to continue on the conservation track, but with a focus on bats instead. Shortly after she took a course in bats bioacoustics and the German scientist and ecologist Elisabeth Kalko became one of her mentors. As a student, she researched the reproductive patterns of fruit bats for her thesis and worked with her mentor Aide√© Vargas to conduct a year-long expedition to track down the Nariz de Espada (the sword-nosed bat), a species believed to have become extinct in Bolivia since the early 1930s. Stationed in caves near Bolivia‚Äôs border with Brazil (a location known to be a hub for drug traffickers), Barboza Marquez remembers the toll the trip took on her physically, mentally and emotionally. ‚ÄúIt was the first time that I seriously asked myself if all of this was worth it,‚Äù she recalls. All of her uncertainty melted away, however, when she laid eyes on the Nariz de Espada. ‚ÄúOur finding meant that, at least in Bolivia, the species was not extinct and that we could begin work on its conservation. The feeling was incredible and overwhelming,‚Äù she says. In 2006, Barboza Marquez and Aide√© Vargas rediscovered a species of bat thought to have been extinct in Bolivia for 72 years. The species, known as the Bolivian sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina aurita) is now protected in an area of the Santa Cruz Department known as the Ecological Sanctuary of the Town of San Juan de Corralito located in the √Ångel Sandoval Province. This is the first area specifically designated to protect a species of bat in Latin America. She then continued her education to earn a Masters in Biology and Conservation of Tropical Areas from the Men√©ndez Pelayo International University. The degree program was offered by the Higher Council for Scientific Research of Spain, but classes were completed in Quito in a cooperative study arrangement with the Central University of Ecuador. Since 2010, Barboza Marquez has traveled to many countries and taught about the bio- acoustics of bats and their benefits to society. Primarily, the two types of bats are insect-eating and pollinating. Those that eat insects provide important pest-control services to zoomophilous plants including the agave from which tequila is made, mangoes, bananas and guavas. As part of her doctorate research, Barboza Marquez studied the bat species in Madrid in conjunction with the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, where 27 of the native bat species are endangered. After her research in Madrid was complete, Barboza Marquez returned to Cochabamba to finish the work on her PhD and participate in projects with the Conservation of Bats in Bolivia project and the Latin American Network for the Conservation of Bats. ‚ÄúBeing a woman in science is really a privilege, especially in my country,‚Äù Kathrin shares. ‚ÄúI have had some cases of machismo and I realised how often we normalise it or don‚Äôt speak up for ourselves. There is not only discrimination for being a female scientist but also for being young. My merit and the value of my work were questioned several times because I am a young woman scientist.‚Äù To see more young women in the conservation field, Barboza Marquez suggests that schools and universities ‚Äúcreate spaces for young girls to engage in conversations with women in the field.‚Äù For girls interested in pursuing careers as conservationists, Barboza Marquez advises studying biology at university. In the fall of 2019, fires ravaged over 4.2 million acres of land in Bolivia, including the Chiquitano forest, a unique ecoregion where Barboza Marquez worked for six years. From her current home in La Paz, Barboza Marquez worked to assist the devastated lands, which included educating the public about the fires and their effects on Bolivian nature and wildlife. ‚ÄúWe are gathering information so we can publish as much as possible about the problem and make people aware so we can unite in the efforts to save what‚Äôs left,‚Äù she shares. Barboza Marquez knows that there‚Äôs a lot of work ahead in the fight to protect Bolivia‚Äôs biodiversity and bats, but through her research and advocacy, she is making progress every day for the country‚Äôs natural habitats and mammals, particularly her two-taloned friends. Now with over a decade of experience under her belt, Barboza Marquez has taught bat bioacoustic courses across Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru, Spain and Uruguay. She currently works as an associate investigator of mammalogy, the study of mammals, at the Natural History Museum Alcide d‚ÄôOrbigny. She also teaches courses on fieldwork, flora and fauna inventories and biodiversity at the environmental education startup, Natural Zone. In addition to biology, Barboza Marquez enjoys the practice of pilates, to which she dedicates between four and seven hours a day. That activity that started accidentally, but has become another of her passions. She is currently an instructor and board member of Mundo Pilates, a center specialized in that technique in Cochabamba. ‚ÄúI learned about Pilates because of an injury that I had in my back due to an accident that I suffered on one of my trips. I liked it, I was cured and began to become aware of the importance of good posture. It helps me clear my mind,‚Äù she says. She also confesses his interest in baking and on her days off her greatest entertainment is watching a good movie at home. Accomplishments Barboza Marquez won a grant in 2007 from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute to conduct research at Barro Colorado Island in Panama. Her project focused on the forest and island borders' effects on the habitat of the island bat population. Upon completion of her work in Panama, Barboza Marquez won the 2009 National Georgraphic, Young Explorer Scholarship Grant. She used the scholarship funds to conduct research on the acoustics of bats in the Beni Savanna of northern Bolivia. She created one of the first libraries of echolocation frequencies for insectivorous bats in Bolivia. \\"Bats have taken me to many countries that I never expected to know. For me the most important thing in life is to be in touch with nature. Listening to them is an indescribable emotion, it is about making something that nobody can hear audible,\\" concludes the biologist. In addition, she and other scientists conducted a study of ectoparasites on the bat population of the savanna. No comprehensive study had ever been conducted on parasitism of bat colonies. The scientists used mist nets to capture and release their study subjects over a five-month period at the Spirit Wildlife Refuge. As a result, they have cataloged more than 20 morphotypes of mites and ticks and studies are on-going to identify the remaining samples. In 2012, she was awarded one of the L'Or√©al-UNESCO Fellowships for Women in Science and became the first Bolivian to win the award. ‚ÄúI remember crying with happiness and pride for being able to represent Bolivia at an event of that magnitude because we know that science in Latin America is not valued. So, for me, this reinforced how important it was to champion girls and women in science back in my country and in Latin America.‚Äù She used her award to further her study of the ultrasound spectrum of bats, which is not within the human hearing range. The manner of the call, frequency, duration and pulse-intervals are recorded to determine whether bats are communicating or are searching for food. The recordings also help to determine which species live in certain areas. In 2013, she was named as one of the ten leading women scientists of Latin America by the BBC.

(https://books.google.com/books?id=PelXAAAAcAAJ&pg;=PA167) The see is mentioned in historical sources only from the 14th century, but no longer in its own right, only as 'united' with the Diocese of Stephaniaca (in Epirus, suffragan of Dyrrachium) and soon also with some Diocese of Prisca (which Eubel (op. cit., vol. I, p. 463) believes a copyist error; some identify it with Pristina or Prizren, despite suspicious geographical distance, while L. Petit identifies the see with the village Presa or Press in Albania), due to Ottoman Turkish occupations rendering its situation instable, seeing most Catholics flee the region. The Kanun of Scanderbeg (Alb. Kanuni i Sk√´nderbeut) was adhered to by the Albanians of northern central Albania, primarily in the regions of Benda, but also Dibra, Kruja, Kurbin, and Martanesh, - that is, the territory that was once part of the principality created by Scanderbeg.Robert Elsie: Historical Dictionary of Albania, p.299 (https://archive.org/details/RobertEliseHistoricalDictionaryOfAlbania2NdEdition.pdf/mode/2up/search/Benda) A geographical map published in 1689, shows the diocese comprising a mountainous region in central Albania, bounded by the Latin dioceses of Acrida (Ochrid), Kruj√´ and Chunavia.Giacomo Cantelli da Vignola, Albania propria, Rome 1689 At least the union with Stephaniacum last till both disappear in the late 17th century, after 1669 when an Archbishop of Durr√´s was given administration of the see of Benda. Still in 1640, Archbishop of Durr√´s, Marco Scura, a Franciscan, describes to Propaganda Fide the see of Benda under his administration (quoted by Farlati): its old cathedral in the 'pagus' (district) Moilitus, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, was ravaged to the ground, the episcopal quarter had no more ministers or faithful; its 20 to 27 parishes, for circa 2.000 Catholic residents, being served by 8 priest.

Plot  Karen, a life-weary single-mother and waitress finds her life disrupted when her father, Frank, is finally released after 20 years in the State Pen. It was she who provided the key testimony that had him convicted of murdering his wife. She still believes he did it, but is unable to remember the exact details of the traumatic event. This thriller chronicles the events that follow her father's return. First of all he begins ingratiating himself with her young son and her lover. Angered, she confronts him, but finds him too persuasively charming to stay angry. He then convinces her that her memory is faulty and that her mother died accidentally. She believes him and accepts him back. The tale takes a much darker turn, when her father begins isolating her from her friends and dominating her life.

His work represents a break with the tradition of grand themes in Belgian marine art in favour of a realist representation of nature.Pol de Mont, 'De schilderkunst in Belgi√´ van 1830 tot 1921', The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, p. 160-161, 165-168 Life and work Leemans studied at the Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp. The teachers and pupils of the Antwerp Academy with an interest in marine painting worked in the Romantic tradition: Jacob Jacobs depicted stormy scenes and Hendrik Frans Schaefels preferred scenes of historic naval engagements. Leemans broke with this Romantic and historical approach to marine art in favour of a more realistic rendering of nature even in its modest appearance. Leemans painted his marine landscapes from nature although he may have finalised his works in the studio. His most frequent subjects are landscapes of rivers or canals with sailing boats in old cities in Flanders and The Netherlands. He had a preference for showing the reflection of the moonlight on river landscapes.Egide Fran√ßois Leemans at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Adrien Jean Joseph Delen, 'Modern Belgian Etchers and Copper Engravers', Belgian Government Information Center, 1951, p. vii Most of his works have a silvery gray undertone. As his style of marine art did not follow the contemporary Romantic, grandiose vision of Belgian marine art, his works did not sell well and he died in relative poverty. A few still lifes by Leemans depicting flowers and fruit typically set in a landscape are also recorded.Egide Fran√ßois Leemans (Belgian, 1839‚Äì1883), 'Still life with pumpkin, grapes and plums' at ArtnetAttributed to Egide Fran√ßois Leemans (Belgian, 1839‚Äì1883), 'Floral still life in urn in a landscape' at Artnet Gallery File:Egide Fran√ßois Leemans - Summer evening.jpgSummer evening File:Egide Fran√ßois Leemans - Canal in Dordrecht at moonlight.jpgCanal in Dordrecht at moonlight File:Egide Fran√ßois Leemans - Seascape.jpgSeascape References Further reading * Hostyn, Norbert, ‚ÄòDe zee en de kunst : Frans Hens en Egidius-Frans Leemans. - Met 3 afb.

However, practically, DSP problems are often not only 1-D. For instance, image data are 2-D signals and radar signals are 3-D signals. While the number of dimension increases, the time and/or storage complexity of processing digital signals grow dramatically. Therefore, solving DSP problems in real-time is extremely difficult in reality. Modern general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) are considered as having an excellent throughput on vector operations and numeric manipulations through a high degree of parallel computations. While processing digital signals, particularly multidimensional signals, often involves a series of vector operations on massive numbers of independent data samples, GPGPUs are now widely employed to accelerate multidimensional DSP, such as image processing, video codecs, radar signal analysis, sonar signal processing, and ultrasound scanning. Conceptually, using GPGPU devices to perform multidimensional DSP is able to dramatically reduce the computation complexity compared with central processing units (CPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other FPGA accelerators.  Motivation  Processing multidimensional signals is a common problem in scientific research and/or engineering computations. Typically, a DSP problem's computation complexity grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. Notwithstanding, with a high degree of time and storage complexity, it is extremely difficult to process multidimensional signals in real-time. Although many fast algorithms (e.g. FFT) have been proposed for 1-D DSP problems, they are still not efficient enough to be adapted in high dimensional DSP problems. Therefore, it is still hard to obtain the desired computation results with digital signal processors (DSPs). Hence, better algorithms and hardware architecture are needed to accelerate multidimensional DSP computations.  Existing approaches  Practically, to accelerate multidimensional DSP, some common approaches have been proposed and developed in the past decades. = Lower sampling rate = A makeshift to achieve a real-time requirement in multidimensional DSP applications is to use a lower sampling rate, which can efficiently reduce the number of samples to be processed at one time and thereby decrease the total processing time. However, this can lead to the aliasing problem due to the sampling theorem and poor- quality outputs. In some applications, such as military radars and medical images, we are eager to have highly precise and accurate results. In such cases, using a lower sampling rate to reduce the amount of computation in the multidimensional DSP domain is not always allowable. = Digital signal processors = Digital signal processors are designed specifically to process vector operations. They have been widely used in DSP computations for decades. However, most digital signal processors are only capable of manipulating a few operations in parallel. This kind of design is sufficient to accelerate audio processing (1-D signals) and image processing (2-D signals). However, with a large number of data samples of multidimensional signals, this is still not powerful enough to retrieve computation results in real-time. = Supercomputer assistance = In order to accelerate multidimensional DSP computations, using dedicated supercomputers or cluster computers is required in some circumstances, e.g., weather forecasting and military radars. Nevertheless, using supercomputers designated to simply perform DSP operations takes considerable money cost and energy consumption. Also, it is not practical and suitable for all multidimensional DSP applications. = GPU acceleration = GPUs are originally devised to accelerate image processing and video stream rendering. Moreover, since modern GPUs have good ability to perform numeric computations in parallel with a relatively low cost and better energy efficiency, GPUs are becoming a popular alternative to replace supercomputers performing multidimensional DSP.  GPGPU computations  GPGPU/SIMD computation model. Modern GPU designs are mainly based on the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) computation paradigm. This type of GPU devices is so-called general-purpose GPUs (GPGPUs). GPGPUs are able to perform an operation on multiple independent data concurrently with their vector or SIMD functional units. A modern GPGPU can spawn thousands of concurrent threads and process all threads in a batch manner. With this nature, GPGPUs can be employed as DSP accelerators easily while many DSP problems can be solved by divide-and-conquer algorithms. A large scale and complex DSP problem can be divided into a bunch of small numeric problems and be processed altogether at one time so that the overall time complexity can be reduced significantly. For example, multiplying two matrices can be processed by concurrent threads on a GPGPU device without any output data dependency. Therefore, theoretically, by means of GPGPU acceleration, we can gain up to speedup compared with a traditional CPU or digital signal processor.  GPU programming languages  Currently, there are several existing programming languages or interfaces which support GPGPU programming. = CUDA = CUDA is the standard interface to program NVIDIA GPUs. NVIDIA also provides many CUDA libraries to support DSP acceleration on NVIDIA GPU devices. = OpenCL = OpenCL is an industrial standard which was originally proposed by Apple Inc. and is maintained and developed by the Khronos Group now. OpenCL provides C++ like APIs for programming different devices universally, including GPGPUs. OpenCL program execution flow The following figure illustrates the execution flow of launching an OpenCL program on a GPU device. The CPU first detects OpenCL devices (GPU in this case) and than invokes a just-in-time compiler to translate the OpenCL source code into target binary. CPU then sends data to GPU to perform computations. When the GPU is processing data, CPU is free to process its own tasks. = C++ AMP = C++ AMP is a programming model proposed by Microsoft. C++ AMP is a C++ based library designed for programming SIMD processors = OpenACC = OpenACC is a programming standard for parallel computing developed by Cray, CAPS, NVIDIA and PGI. OpenAcc targets programming for CPU and GPU heterogeneous systems with C, C++, and Fortran extensions.  Examples of GPU programming for multidimensional DSP  = matrix multiplication = Suppose and are two matrices and we would like to compute . \\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} & \\\\cdots & A_{1m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} & \\\\cdots & A_{2m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{m1} & A_{m2} & \\\\cdots & A_{mm} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\quad\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} B_{11} & B_{12} & \\\\cdots & B_{1m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_{21} & B_{22} & \\\\cdots & B_{2m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_{m1} & B_{m2} & \\\\cdots & B_{mm} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{C}=\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & \\\\cdots & C_{1m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{21} & C_{22} & \\\\cdots & C_{2m} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{m1} & C_{m2} & \\\\cdots & C_{mm} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\quad C_{ij}=\\\\sum_{k=1}^m A_{ik}B_{kj} To compute each element in takes multiplications and additions. Therefore, with a CPU implementation, the time complexity to achieve this computation is Œò(n3) in the following C example. However, we have known that elements in are independent of each other. Hence, the computation can be fully parallelized by SIMD processors, such as GPGPU devices. With a GPGPU implementation, the time complexity significantly reduces to Œò(n) by unrolling the for-loop as shown in the following OpenCL example. // MxM matrix multiplication in C void matrixMul( float *A, // input matrix A float *B, // input matrix B float *C, // output matrix C int size) // size of the matrices { // N x N x N iterations for (int row = 0; row < size; row++) { for (int col = 0; col < size; col++) { int id = row * size + col; flot sum = 0.0; for (int m = 0; m < size; m++) { sum += (A[row * size + m] * B[m * size + col]); } C[id] = sum; } } } // MxM matrix multiplication in OpenCL __kernel void matrixMul( __global float *A, // input matrix A __global float *B, // input matrix B __global float *C, // output matrix C __global int size) // size of the matrices { size_t id = get_global_id(0); // each thread works on an element size_t row = id / size; size_t col = id % size; float sum = 0.0; // N iterations for (int m = 0; m < size; m++) { sum += (A[row * size + m] * B[m * size + col]); } C[id] = sum; } = Multidimensional convolution = Convolution is a frequently used operation in DSP. To compute the 2-D convolution of two m √ó m signals, it requires multiplications and additions for an output element. That is, the overall time complexity is Œò(n4) for the entire output signal. As the following OpenCL example shows, with GPGPU acceleration, the total computation time effectively decreases to Œò(n2) since all output elements are data independent. 2-D convolution equation: y(n_1, n_2)=x(n_1,n_2)**h(n_1,n_2)=\\\\sum_{k_1=0}^{m-1}\\\\sum_{k_2=0}^{m-1}x(k_1, k_2)h(n_1-k_1, n_2-k_2) // 2-D convolution implementation in OpenCL __kernel void convolution( __global float *x, // input signal x __global float *h, // filter h __global float *y, // output signal y __global int size) // size of ROS of the input signal and filter { size_t id = get_global_id(0); // each thread works on an element size_t row = size + size - 1; // number of rows of the output signal size_t col = size + size - 1; // number of columns of the output signal size_t n1 = id / row; size_t n2 = id % col; float sum = 0.0; // N x N iterations for (int k1 = 0; k1 < size; k1++) { for (int k2 = 0; k2 < size; k2++) { sum += (x[k1 * row + k2] * h[(n1 * row - k1) + (n2 - k2)]); } } C[id] = sum; } Note that, although the example demonstrated above is a 2-D convolution, a similar approach can be adopted for a higher dimension system. Overall, for a s-D convolution, a GPGPU implementation has time complexity Œò(ns), whereas a CPU implementation has time complexity Œò(n2s). M-D convolution equation: y(n_1,n_2,...,n_s)=x(n_1,n_2,...,n_s)**h(n_1,n_2,...,n_s)=\\\\sum_{k_1=0}^{m_1-1}\\\\sum_{k_2=0}^{m_2-1}...\\\\sum_{k_s=0}^{m_s-1}x(k_1, k_2,...,k_s)h(n_1-k_1,n_2-k_2,...,n_s-k_s) = Multidimensional discrete time fourier transform (M-D DTFT) = In addition to convolution, the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) is another technique which is often used in system analysis. X(\\\\Omega_1,\\\\Omega_2,...,\\\\Omega_s)=\\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{m_1-1}\\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{m_2-1}...\\\\sum_{n_s=0}^{m_s-1}x(n_1, n_2,...,n_s)e^{-j(\\\\Omega_1n_1+\\\\Omega_1n_1+...+\\\\Omega_sn_s)} Practically, to implement an M-D DTFT, we can perform M times 1-D DFTF and matrix transpose with respect to each dimension. With a 1-D DTFT operation, GPGPU can conceptually reduce the complexity from Œò(n2) to Œò(n) as illustrated by the following example of OpenCL implementation. That is, an M-D DTFT the complexity of GPGPU can be computed on a GPU with a complexity of Œò(n2). While some GPGPUs are also equipped with hardware FFT accelerators internally, this implementation might be also optimized by invoking the FFT APIs or libraries provided by GPU manufacture. // DTFT in OpenCL __kernel void convolution( __global float *x_re, __global float *x_im, __global float *X_re, __global float *X_im, __global int size) { size_t id = get_global_id(0); // each thread works on an element X_re[id] = 0.0; X_im[id] = 0.0; for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { X_re += (x_re[id] * cos(2 * 3.1415 * id / size) - x_im[id] * sin(2 * 3.1415 * id / size)); X_im += (x_re[id] * sin(2 * 3.1415 * id / size) + x_im[id] * cos(2 * 3.1415 * id / size)); } }  Real applications  = Digital filter design = Designing a multidimensional digital filter is a big challenge, especially IIR filters. Typically it relies on computers to solve difference equations and obtain a set of approximated solutions. While GPGPU computation is becoming popular, several adaptive algorithms have been proposed to design multidimensional FIR and/or IIR filters by means of GPGPUs. = Radar signal reconstruction and analysis = Radar systems usually need to reconstruct numerous 3-D or 4-D data samples in real-time. Traditionally, particularly in military, this needs supercomputers' support. Nowadays, GPGPUs are also employed to replace supercomputers to process radar signals. For example, to process synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals, it usually involves multidimensional FFT computations. GPGPUs can be used to rapidly perform FFT and/or iFFT in this kind of applications. = Self-driving cars = Many self-driving cars apply 3-D image recognition techniques to auto control the vehicles. Clearly, to accommodate the fast changing exterior environment, the recognition and decision processes must be done in real-time. GPGPUs are excellent devices to achieve the goal. = Medical image processing = In order to have accurate diagnosis, 2-D or 3-D medical signals, such as ultrasound, X-ray, MRI, and CT, often require very high sampling rate and image resolutions to reconstruct images. By applying GPGPUs' superior computation power, it was shown that we can acquire better-quality medical images  References  Category:Digital signal processors Category:Digital signal processing Category:GPGPU Category:Parallel computing ","title":"Multidimensional DSP with GPU Acceleration"},{"id":"48422261","text":"Ragnar \\"Raggi\\" √û√≥rhallsson (born 6 March 1987) is an Icelandic musician.

Boniface was the son of Alfonso Fadrique, vicar-general of the Duchy of Athens and the Duchy of Neopatras, and of Marulla of Verona, daughter of the baron of Karystos, Boniface of Verona. When Alfonso Fadrique died in 1338, Boniface inherited his mother's barony of Karystos and various other possessions across Attica. He remained in Sicily until 1359, when he came to Greece to claim them. In 1365 however he sold his barony of Karystos with all its possessions, including serfs, to Venice, which had long coveted it, for 6,000 ducats. James Fadrique had also willed to his brother \\"all his rights and properties\\" in the Duchy of Athens, including the County of Salona with Loidoriki and Veteranitsa, but not Zetounion and Siderokastron, which passed to James' son Louis Fadrique.

When James died in 1366, this left Boniface and his nephew Louis as the two most powerful lords in the Catalan domains. The two got on badly, as Louis challenged the cession of his father's domains to Boniface. Louis prevailed in the dispute: in 1375 he was recognized by Frederick III of Sicily as vicar- general of Athens and Neopatras, and in a clash between Louis and Boniface soon after, the former prevailed. Boniface's son Peter was sent to exile and imprisonment in Aragon, Louis confiscated their domains, while Boniface himself died sometime before September 1380. On 8 May 1381 Boniface's widow Dulcia and her other son, John, obtained a royal pardon for Boniface as well as the restoration of his confiscated properties from Peter IV of Aragon.

Once separated from the mainland by a natural sound, this navigable route was rendered unusable in more modern times by post-glacial rebound and has been replaced by the artificial Draget Canal. The island is a nature reserve. Nature reserve J√§rflotta is a flat island which covers about . The entire island, as well as some outlying islands, constitute a nature reserve which in total covers around , including water. Most of the island consists of a sandy heath and Scots pine forest. Only the central part of the island contains arable land. Unusually for Stockholm County, the island has several sandy beaches which are a habitat for a number of red listed plants. The islands surrounding J√§rflotta, especially Gunnarsh√∂garna, are also included in the nature reserve and support important habitats for birds such as Caspian tern, razorbill, black guillemot and common murre. The explicit purpose of the nature reserve is to preserve an important archipelago environment and make it accessible for recreation and, for the outlying islands, to protect the bird-life. Parts of the nature reserve belongs to the EU-wide Natura 2000-network. Coastal artillery battery The coastal artillery battery in 1943 Parts of a former coastal artillery battery, which now consists of a single 9.4in (24cm 43calibre) Bofors M06 naval gun, are still present on J√§rflotta. The site was decommissioned during the 1990s, and today is preserved as a protected historical building. The 9.4in gun is believed to be the largest caliber preserved in Sweden. The coastal artillery battery, which dates from 1942, is part of a series of fortifications built during World War II to protect S√∂dert√§lje and Nyn√§shamn from attack and minefields in the Baltic Sea. The battery originally consisted of three guns that were relocated to J√§rflotta from a fortification in Vaxholm. Barbed wire and a total of 291 concrete bunkers defended the site from direct assault. When the battery was deemed fit for action in 1943 it was manned by 605 personnel. After the war, the battery remained part of Swedish defensive planning during the Cold War. As late as 1954, it was used in exercises simulating seaborne attacks by the Soviet Navy. In 1948, nine people died in an explosion at the gun battery while handling ammunition. Whether the cause was the result of sabotage or mishandling of the ammunition has never been clarified. Although the coastal battery ceased as an artillery platform in the 1950s, it remained in military use until it was decommissioned in the 1990s.

After winning both his races as a two-year-old he developed into a top-class performer in 2015, recording Group One victories in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains and the Prix de la For√™t. Background Make Believe is a bay colt with a small white star and two white socks bred in the United Kingdom by the Buckinghamshire-based Aston Mullins Stud. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Makfi, who won the 2000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois in 2010. Make Believe's dam Rosie's Posy was a moderate racehorse who won one minor race from six starts, but was descended from the influential broodmare Crystal Palace, the ancestor of many major winners including Royal Palace, Light Cavalry, Fairy Footsteps and Desert Prince. Before foaling Make Believe, Rosie's Posy had produced Dubawi Heights, whose wins included the Gamely Stakes and the Yellow Ribbon Stakes. Make Believe was consigned as a foal to the Tattersalls sale in November 2012 and was bought for 180,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Hugo Merry. He entered the ownership of Prince A A Faisal and was sent into training with Andr√© Fabre at Chantilly. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= Make Believe began his racing career in a maiden race over 1500 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 23 October and started the 7/10 favourite against ten opponents. Ridden by Maxime Guyon he led from the start and won by one and a half lengths from Sinfonietta. On heavy ground at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 18 November he started 1/2 favourite for the Prix Tanerko over the same distance, and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths from Lugana. =2015: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Make Believe was ridden by Pierre- Charles Boudot and started favourite for the Grade Three Prix Djebel over 1400 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 2 April. After racing in second place he took the lead 400 metres from the finish but was caught in the final stride and beaten a head by the Freddy Head-trained Ride Like The Wind. Olivier Peslier took over the ride when make believe was one of eighteen colt to contest the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He was made the 5/1 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien- trained Highland Reel with the Prix de Fontainebleau runner-up Karar next in the betting. Few of the others were given any serious chance, but the more fancied outsiders included Muhaarar from England and the Fabre stable's second runner New Bay. Peslier sent the colt into the lead from the start and set a steady pace before accelerating clear of the field 400 metres from the finish. He never looked in any danger of defeat and won by three lengths from New Bay with Mr Owen and Karar in third and fourth. Explaining his choice of tactics, Peslier said \\"He is a horse who is the ideal type to try and make all and I didn't hestitate in trying to do so. He broke well and although he was a little bit keen early I managed to settle him quite quickly. When you get on a roll like that you don't want to stop them and he finished very well\\". In June Make Believe was sent to England for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot and started second favourite behind Gleneagles. After pulling hard against Peslier's attempts to restrain him he faded quickly in the last quarter mile and finished last of the five runners, more than twelve lengths behind the winning favourite. Commenting on the performance some time later, Faisal's racing advisor Ted Voute said \\"He ran a bit flat at Ascot and Andre has always said he is a delicate horse and that we need to look after him. We possibly ran him back too quick after the French Guineas and we'll let the horse tell us when he is ready for a run\\". Make Believe was off the racecourse for three and a half months before returning on 4 October when he was matched against older horses for the first time in the Prix de la For√™t over 1400 metres at Longchamp. The three-year-old British gelding Limato started favourite after an impressive win in the Park Stakes with Make Believe next in the betting on 9/2. The other runners included Taniyar (Prix du Pin), Toormore, Gordon Lord Byron (winner of the race in 2012), Custom Cut (Boomerang Stakes), G Force (Haydock Sprint Cup) and Ride Like The Wind. After tracking the leaders, Peslier switched his mount to the outside to make his challenge 400 metres out. Make Believe accelerated into the lead, opened up a clear advantage and won by one and a quarter lengths from the fast-finishing Limato. Toormore got the best of a five-horse blanket finish for third place. On his final start of the season, Make Believe was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Keeneland on 31 October. He was made the 2.7/1 favourite in a field which also included Esoterique and Karakontie. He started slowly and never looked likely to win, finishing fifth of the twelve runners behind Tepin. Stud record Make Believe was retired from racing to stand as a breeding stallion at the Ballylinch Stud in Ireland. In his first season at stud he sired the Prix du Jockey Club winner Mishriff.

She was a member of Ukraine women's artistic gymnastics national team in 2002‚Äì2008, and won two gold medals in team at the 2006 Gymnasiade and 2007 Universiade. She cooperated with Cirque du Soleil, and created her own Passion Show.  Biography  Nadya Vasina was born in Kiev, Ukraine, to a family involved in arts and sports. Her mother was part of the USSR athletic team and now works as a translator. Her father created the first Ukrainian radio stations and some big musical projects, and now works as a main manager of a municipal radio station. Nadya spent all her childhood and youth involved in sports. After finishing her sport career, she started to work as artist of an original genre creating her authorised shows and performing all over the world. She also became a very involved social activist. Nadya is primarily known for her extraordinary flexibility, and has received widespread praise from fans on her abilities. Regarded by many as one of the most flexible performers in the world, she has appeared on multiple media platforms, and has gained particular notoriety for being able to fold her body completely in half. In addition to her extreme flexibility, Vasina has garnered attraction for various shows and performances which carry themes of love, lust or greed. Her most famous show; \\"Rose\\" which involves Nadya in a red short dress finding a rose from a previous lover, Vasina proceeds to dance and perform to the rose, placing it between her toes and placing them in her mouth. Nadya has garnered most fame from this performance. in her show \\"Money\\" Vasina starts as a banker in a black suit and shoes, over the course of the performance Vasina realises she is surrounded by money and dances around, on top of, and with the money. Eventually Nadya transforms into a golden plated goddess of money, seduced by the money itself. By the end of the performance, Nadya has reverted to her normal self, pulling a note of money from her pocket, hinting at the ordeal having really taken place. Vasina often interprets her feet and legs into her performances, often mistaken for podophilia which involves women seducing others using legs and more often feet. Nadya uses her legs and feet to seduce those around her in performances such as \\"Rose\\" among others, no reason for this has been given by Vasina or her team, most likely the reasons would be that contortion is a very seductive art, legs portray a big role in the seduction of audience members.

Plot  Eugene Aram is a down-on-his luck character, who is explained to be a distant relation of Richard Housman, who is a criminal just trying to get by. Housman is entertained by Eugene's problems. Eugene is trying to teach himself and devises his own curriculum, but fails. Housman comes across a letter written by a man named Clark Lester to his son, Walter. The letter promises a reward of jewels and valuables to Walter, who has saved a man's life in India. The letter came from Grassdale, England. Housman decides that he should rob Clark of his jewels and valuables, and takes Eugene along with him. In Grassdale, Housman attacks Clark, just as Eugene comes along to find the two. Eugene seizes Clark and Clark is killed by Housman. Eaten with remorse, Eugene refuses to take anything from Housman. Five years later, Eugene is a school teacher in Grassdale. Walter, the son of the dead Clark, lives in Grassdale and is in love with a woman named Madeline. Madeline does not care about Walter at all, but her sister, Eleanor, loves him. Aram is struggling with the guilt of killing Clark. Everything seems to be conspiring to remind him that he killed a man. Even his pupils seem to put too much emphasis on certain words and sentences. Eugene meets Madeline and they fall in love. This, of course, enrages Walter. He warns Madeline that Eugene is no good. Housman is now a professional thief. He and his gang force themselves into the Lester home and run into Eugene, who shoots Housman. Housman asks Eugene to meet him at the glen the next day. At the glen, Housman demands money to keep him quiet, or else he will inform Eugene's friends about Clark's murder. Eugene agrees, and travels to London to give Housman his money. Housman promises to leave the country. Back in Grassdale, Walter keeps insulting Eugene to Madeline's face. Housman receives word that his daughter, Ann, is dying. He besieges Walter on his way to London and steals his horse, renowned for its speed. However, he is too late. Ann has already died. He finds Ann dead and stumbles off to the nearest inn, to get drunk. At the inn, some strangers are discussing the unearthing of a skeleton. They believe it to be Clark's skeleton, who was said to have gone missing five years earlier. Walter enters the inn and is listening. Housman drunkenly gets up and says they are wrong, and he knows where Clark's body is. He takes them to St. Robert's cave, unearths the skeleton of Clark, and then tells Walter that Eugene committed the murder. Eugene is arrested, tried, and condemned based on Housman's testimony. Walter asks Eugene to confess, and Eugene tells the whole story. However, this does not take away his sentence. Madeline hears of his sentence and dies on the spot. The movie ends with Eugene being hanged for his crime.

R. Rahman, to the 2000 Indian Tamil film of the same name. The soundtrack album consists of nine tracks in original Tamil and Hindi versions of the albums whereas the Telugu version of the album has seven tracks. The soundtrack of Alaipayuthey was unanimously hailed as a Mani Ratnam film soundtrack turning for rhythmic fusion using modern synthesizers. A film, initially planned with film score, the recording of the songs eventually took place. The soundtrack was well received by the audience and received a number of awards held in the subsequent year. The original soundtrack sold over six lakh cassettes, and A. R. Rahman won the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director in 2000. The film score achieved cult status after the release of the film. Development Initially, director Mani Ratnam wanted A. R. Rahman to compose only the film score. However, by the end of filming, nine songs were recorded. The lyrics of the track \\"Pachchai Nirame\\" are based on colours. The track is influenced by the instrumental works of Kitaro. The song is based on the raga \\"Kharaharapriya\\" and brings out the relaxing effect by using the facets of the musical scales. Cinematographer P. C. Sreeram used different color lenses as per the lyrical lines while filming this track. The song uses reverberating effect throughout its length. However, Rahman used light percussion, gently strummed acoustic guitars and layered the acoustic and synthesized versions of the same instrument. Additionally, the track has sounds of flute, violins and percussions. For Pachchai Nirame, Rahman ensured to use the timbres effectively so that the picturisation of the song matches to the tune. The track was filmed at Taj Mahal, village, lake, forests of Kashmir. The track \\"Snehithane Snehithane\\" is an ode by a wife to the husband. The track is based on the Shringaar raag. \\"Snehithane Snehithane\\" has a video edit version, with additional opening vocals by Ustaad Rashid Khan. The video edit version was released only as a bonus track on the soundtrack and cassettes of Alaipayuthey (Original version) and not on Sakhi (Telugu version) or Saathiya (Hindi version). However, the video edit version was used in all the three film versions. \\"Kaadhal Sadugudu\\" consists guitar riffs, based on the IndiPop and coming of age genre. The song was regarded as 'Beach Song' by Ratnam. The track \\"September Maadham\\" is a funky track, loosely based on fast paced R. D. Burman music. \\"Yaaro Yarodi\\" is a rustic number that blends of folk instrument sounds appearing intermittently. The track was used in the 2008 film The Accidental Husband. \\"Maangalyam\\" song consists of nuptial mantras interspersed with lyrics of \\"Endrendrum Punngai\\". The rhythm pattern of the song \\"Endrendrum Punnagai\\" was inspired by the song \\"Everybody\\" by Backstreet Boys. The title track \\"Alaipayuthey\\" was originally composed by the Carnatic music composer Oothukkadu Venkata Subbaiyar, who also set it to the raagam 'Kaanada'. Rahman added additional beats to the track. The track \\"Evano Oruvan\\" which has an Egyptian base to its composition. Singer Bombay Jayashri recorded for the film score. Rahman made her sing the raag Sindhu Bhairavi for half an hour whose portions were used in a scene when the lead actress was hospitalized in the film. For the Hindi version of the soundtrack, the songs, \\"Alaipayuthey\\" and \\"Evano Oruvan\\" were not re-composed. Instead, Rahman composed a Sufi track \\"Mere Yaar Mila De\\" and \\"Naina Milaike\\", a classical number. Lyricist Gulzar, who wrote all the Hindi version songs, stated, \\"In Saathiya I wrote 'Mere Yaar Mila De', which isn't a typical romantic number though it's essentially a love song.\\" Unlike previous soundtracks recorded by Rahman for Ratnam, the former composed majority of the songs by fusing the classical carnatic music genres into moderns rhythms.  Critical response  = Original version = Critic based at The Hindu asserted, \\"A. R. Rahman's numbers are already a hit ‚Äì be it \\"Pachchai Niramae zestfully rendered by Hariharan or the melodious \\"Snegithanae or \\"Yaaro Yaarodi. Now they come with added flavour in the form of excellently captured visuals and scenic presentations.\\" However, the song \\"September Madham was criticized to obstruct the smooth flow of scenes with music. Methil Renuka of India Today praised the music of the film, calling it 'great'.St. Louis International Film Festival, critic Rich Cline called the music exuberant and colourful. Based on the 5.1 surround DVD release, James Grey stated, \\"The soundtrack is obviously heavily dubbed, which is not the disk's fault, and while the music doesn't have particular weight it comes across nicely enough. the music surprisingly (to me, anyway) accessible (with one tune going round my head even now).\\" = Hindi version = On penning review for Bollywood Hungama, critic Taran Adarsh stated, \\"A.R. Rahman's music is melodious and easy on the ears. The title track is the pick of the lot, but the item song can easily be deleted, for it serves as a speed breaker in the goings-on. Perhaps, even this song was added to add spice.\\" Critic based at Australian Cine Urban praised the music, \\"A superb digital sound mix drives the all important soundtrack, fantasy music video clips on the cable music channels in that they are multi-costume and multi-location showpieces, taking us from waterfalls to snowy mountain fields to idyllic shorelines. Duets and full scale wedding routines follow each other as the first half zips along with its charter to set the musical mood.\\" Vijay Ramanan of Planet Bollywood, \\"A. R. Rahman's music and score, while simply re- created from the original except for two songs is as usual ‚Äì fantastic.Mr. Brown reviewed the music of the film, \\"The songs-chiefly are the lilting title number; the percussive wedding song \\"Chhalka Chhalka Re\\" (\\"It Spilled\\"); and the seductive ballads \\"Chupke Se\\" (\\"Quietly\\") and \\"Aye Udi Udi Udi\\" (\\"Flew Away\\") a highlight. Glamsham pointed, \\"All in all, all praises to the music composition by A R Rahman; the music is unique and upbeat. A R Rahman has been successful in creating a different genre of music for his ever increasing list of fans. The lyrics is definitely getting subdued by the exciting music.

In the meantime, Morgan's stock market portfolio evaporates in a bad market, his business partner Leo Gross is embezzling money entrusted to their business for himself, and Morgan is gambling (and losing) on professional football games in larger and larger amounts. Morgan orders food, prostitutes, and drugs over the telephone or (later in the film) using his computer and a modem. His television is on almost nonstop. As friends visit, Morgan is revealed to be an agoraphobe, and cannot seem to find the courage to leave his apartment even when doing so may save him financially or personally. He watches the world through his television, video cameras pointed out past his apartment door, and through his windows. Morgan's answering machine is as much the center of his world as his television, used to carefully screen calls and people. Gross, his business partner, assures him that the temporary business losses will be ironed out, and that if Morgan is unavailable to solve the problem, he will be happy to do so on his behalf. In reality, he is redirecting this money for himself, and using Morgan's agoraphobia to his advantage. Meanwhile, Morgan, who gambles on National Football League games casually, has begun to bet more and more on these games to cover quickly mounting losses. Friends make efforts to help Jimmy and even to get him to leave the house, but begin to drift away the deeper he digs himself into his apartment. He finds himself truly alone as they give up, frustrated. Jimmy makes a friendship over his apartment intercom with a homeless person that sleeps in the entryway. He occasionally orders food for the man over the course of days to weeks. Eventually the man disappears as quietly as he arrived. Finances become desperate as Morgan's savings disappear, and gambling losses destroy what little money Morgan has left. He is left in an empty apartment with only his answering machine, after all his possessions are foreclosed upon. Only in this final desperate situation does Morgan finally build the courage to leave his apartment to begin anew, and to contact his wife and daughter before they leave for Chicago.

The field was named after Eddie West, a writer for the Orange County Register and tireless supporter of the Santa Ana College Dons and all Orange County sports. The city's stadium holds many events in addition to its high school and college football main draws, including children's and adult soccer games through local leagues, high school and college commencement ceremonies and more. The City of Santa Ana scheduled retrofitting of the stadium to begin on January 4, 2016 and end on April 30, 2016 but work was not completed until August 2016. Current tenants include the Santa Ana Unified School District's High School football teams, the Santa Ana College Dons football team, and the Mater Dei Monarchs football team. The upstart United Premier Soccer League, founded in Santa Ana, also holds occasional exhibition and league playoff matches at the stadium, for its various clubs. Notable Events Santa Ana College held its Centennial Commencement (1915-2015) at the stadium on the June 5, 2015. Santa Ana Stadium was the site of an international soccer match between the Orange County Soccer Club and the German side Bayern Munich, one of the most popular sports clubs with an estimated 87 million fans worldwide,http://sokkaa.com/2017/03/27/top-7-football-clubs-with-biggest- fanbase-worldwide-today/ on June 10, 1966, in which the clubs played to a 3-3 tie. The Orange County Soccer Club played in a league called the Continental League. That same year, in 1966, the Orange County Soccer Club played the final of the national tournament, the U.S. Open Cup (then called the National Challenge Cup), and played it again in 1967, but was unable to become champion on both occasions. On Friday, January 13, 1989 Club Am√©rica of the Mexican Primera Divisi√≥n, now Liga MX, defeated FC Bayern Munich of the German Bundesliga at Santa Ana Stadium in front of 11,500 in attendance. In March 2011, Santa Ana Winds FC, formerly of the National Premier Soccer League and later a founding member of the United Premier Soccer League, played an exhibition, at Santa Ana Stadium against a Club Atlas youth squad. In December 2011, Winds FC played another exhibition at the stadium, this time against a Chivas De Guadalajara youth squad.

Talks for a possible franchise began as far back as 2007, as then MLS investor Antonio Cue went to a State of the City Address to talk of possibly relocating Chivas USA from the Home Depot Center in Carson to the Santa Ana Stadium site. Plans included relocating the Chivas USA Academy to Santa Ana as well. In 2011, the City of Santa Ana passed a Memorandum of Understanding to enter into a six-month negotiating window with MLS via Chivas USA, (MLS and its teams are a single entity) but MLS never committed to negotiating with Santa Ana for two main reasons. One was Major League Soccer's stance (through investor Antonio Cue) that the City of Santa Ana had to pay to remodel Santa Ana Stadium. The other reason was due to MLS's long insistence on getting a stadium built for their second LA area franchise at the site of the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena at Exposition Park in Los Angeles. The Chivas USA Academy (U-16 and U-18) did play a season at Santa Ana Stadium then left the stadium to settle in Bell Gardens. In 2013, Sue√±o MLS Winner and Chivas USA player Jorge Villafa√±a, who grew up playing soccer in Santa Ana, started a branch of the Chivas USA Academy that played at Santa Ana Stadium until the demise of the first team. Soon after the demise of Chivas USA, Major League Soccer investors in the Chivas USA replacement Los Angeles Football Club franchise identified a number of locations in Greater Los Angeles for a possible home for their \\"LAFC.\\" Santa Ana was again counted among the possible locations for an MLS franchise. A Santa Ana fan group sprouted on social media to attract LAFC to the Santa Ana Stadium site, given its proximity to downtown amenities minutes away on foot, but Major League Soccer through investors involved with LAFC, and with the help of park operator USC, opted on building at Exposition Park in Los Angeles, a site that was identified for years by MLS as a top priority. The social media movement out of Santa Ana formed to attract LAFC was one of the first and became one if the, if not the, largest grassroots groups throughout the LA region to swell to over 600 likes on Facebook, in addition to combined efforts on Twitter and Instagram. NASL Santa Ana Stadium qualifies as a Division 2 stadium under the United States Soccer Federation's current divisional criteria. As such, the stadium was again identified and proposed for housing a professional soccer team, this time by grassroots efforts. Because the stadium has double the size of the USSF division 2 standard of 5000 seats, it was considered ideal for an investment at the Division 2 level. There were proposals to bring back Los Angeles Aztecs and the California Surf, (formerly owned by Henry Segerstrom, developer of South Coast Plaza), this time to Santa Ana Stadium. The original California Surf played at Anaheim Stadium for the duration of their short existence. In 2014, NASL Commissioner Bill Peterson stated the following regarding NASL expansion, \\"We‚Äôve had conversations throughout California, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and others.\\" =Sting and Joe Sumner= On December 11, 2015 Northern California soccer writer Evan Ream stated. \\"[I] can confirm that the singer Sting is in fact involved with the Orange County bid.\\" On January 21, 2016 writer Dave Martinez of Empire of Soccer quoted NASL Commissioner Bill Peterson concerning west coast expansion as saying, \\"We will start making announcements as early as four weeks or as long as eight weeks ‚Ä¶ At least one market ‚Ä¶ could be more.‚Äù The rumor that Gordon Summer, aka \\"Sting,\\" was involved with an NASL club in Orange County turned out false. It was not him, but his son Joe Sumner that was involved but backed out of talks to start a club in the county. Joe Sumner went on to launch a club called City of Angels FC that played one season in the National Premier Soccer League. =Peter Wilt & Club 9 Sports= In November 2016, consultant Peter Wilt of Club 9 Sports studied the possibility of launching an NASL expansion club at Santa Ana Stadium. Wilt and club executive Michael Collins visited Santa Ana Stadium and met with City of Santa Ana City Manager Gerardo Mouet and Councilman Vince Sarmiento to propose use of Santa Ana Stadium, and to determine the costs of upgrading the stadium's seats, lighting, locker rooms and the expansion of the playing field. The NASL Orange County group eventually opted on playing at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium, however, within a year's time the NASL lost Division 2 sanctioning and teams to defection, causing the expansion groups to look for another league to play in. The NASL Orange County group eventually branded itself as California United FC and announced its players would play in the United Premier Soccer League in 2018.

The cartoons have also been published in the Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland, the French magazine Charlie Hebdo and the US magazine RAW.http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003199901_01/_ons003199901_01_0044.php The series' protagonist, Bert, is Kamagurka's most recognizable character. Concept Bert is a middle-aged bespectacled man with a long nose who always wears a sweater and long trousers. His full name is Vanderslagmulders,http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003199901_01/_ons003199901_01_0044.php but is seldom used in the series. He is a flat character, but does demonstrate absurd behaviour. In many cartoons he is giving absurd monologues, often with misanthropic comments. In the early 1990s Bert received his own pet dog: Bobje (\\"Little Bob\\"). Bobje is an anthropomorphic dog with a human face. He is often seen walking on two feet or doing things only humans can. Despite all that he is unable to talk and still treats Bert as his master. History Bert made his debut on November 3, 1977 KOUSEMAKER, Kees en Evelien, \\"Wordt Vervolgd- Stripleksikon der Lage Landen\\", Uitgeverij Het Spectrum, Utrecht, Antwerpen, 1979, in the magazine Humo. Originally the series was named Van Maerlantstraat 23, which was Kamagurka's home address at the time. During the late 1970s the comic sometimes was several pages long, but later it became a one-page gag-a- day comic. Status Bert is one of Humo's mascots and therefore often used on magazine covers or other related merchandising. He was seen in animated form in the opening titles of Kamagurka and Herr Seele's TV sketch show Lava (1989). During the annual Rock Werchter rock festival in Werchter, Belgium, when weather allowed it, a meters high inflatable doll of Bert and Bobje was inflated during several of the festival's editions.

The project began as an effort to track changing butterfly ranges in Canada to determine how climate change may be impacting butterfly distribution in the country. It expanded to cover the U.S. in 2013 after partnering with Kent McFarland of Vermont Center for Ecostudies and Kathleen Prudic of Oregon State University. Participation Members of the eButterfly community enter butterfly sightings as part of regular surveys, organized butterfly counts or as incidental observations. There are checklists for each state and province, and entries can be made with or without photos.

Plot  News anchor Barry Baron (Elliott Gould) discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles (Melissa Sue Anderson) finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka (Mabel King), who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose (Mark Moses). Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan (Phil Bruns) sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh (Jack Betts), who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

He is politically aligned with the Republican Party and was appointed by George H. W. Bush as the co- chairman of the Asian-American Coalition for the 1988 United States presidential election. He was awarded the fourth highest civilian award of the Padma Shri, by the Government of India, in 1999. According to Detroit News, on Dec 6, 2018, Dr. Bothra was charged along with five other doctors, in an unsealed indictment, with cheating Medicare and Medicaid out of almost $500 million and fueling the nation's opioid epidemic by illegally prescribing more than 13 million doses of prescription pain medication. The dollars and drugs involved make the alleged health care fraud conspiracy one of the largest in Michigan history, and one of the largest nationwide. The scheme was focused within three pain clinics in Macomb County. They are The Pain Center USA in Warren and Eastpointe, and Interventional Pain Center in Warren. The three clinics were owned and operated by Dr. Rajendra Bothra, 77, of Bloomfield Hills, a surgeon, humanitarian and politician. In 1999, Bothra was presented with the fourth highest civilian honor bestowed in India, known as the Padmashri. Bothra was cited for humanitarian efforts in India, which included educating people about AIDS, the dangers of tobacco and alcohol, and fundraising efforts for medical equipment. Bothra's clinics \\"sought to bill insurance companies for the maximum number of services and procedures possible with no regard to the patients‚Äô needs,\\" prosecutors alleged. In 2018, Dr Bothra was jailed for fuelling the nation's opioid epidemic, cheating Medicare and subjecting to needless, painful back injections. In January 2019, he was freed on a record-setting USD 7 million bond.

His best known plays included El se√±or Galindez in 1973, La muerte de Margueritte Duras, and Potestad. Pavlovsky was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on December 10, 1933. He originally became a doctor, psychoanalyst and therapist. According to the Buenos Aires Herald, Pavlovsky is considered a \\"pioneer of psychodrama in Latin America.\\" He simultaneously began writing plays, often focusing on social and political issues affecting Argentina during the era. His first major play, El se√±or Galindez, which debuted in 1973, focused on the a torturer who also holds a separate, day-to-day job while keeping his involvement in torture a secret. His other plays included Potestad, Rojos globos rojos, La muerte de Marguerite Duras, La espera tr√°gica, La mueca, Telara√±as, El cardenal, Variaciones Meyerhold, and S√≥lo brumas. He fled Argentina during the late 1970s during the National Reorganization Process military dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla following a series of threats. He lived in exile in Spain until a democratic government was restored during the late 1980s. His film credits as an actor included Tangos, the Exile of Gardel in 1986 and La nube in 1998, both of which were directed by Fernando Solanas. Pavlovsky also published a novel, \\"Sentido contrario,\\" in 1997. Eduardo Pavlovsky died in Buenos Aires on October 4, 2015, at age 81.

It is exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province (which don't exist in the Greek Catholic Church, as it lacks a Metropolitan). The Apostolic Exarchate covers all territory of Turkey. Its cathedral episcopal see is the Ayatriada Rum Katoliki Kilise (Holy Trinity Rum Catholic Church) in Istanbul. As of 2017, it was the sole parish of the exarchate and has 16 parishioners.  History  The first steps toward creating a particular jurisdiction for Greek Catholics of the Byzantine Rite in the European part of the Ottoman Empire were made in 1907, when Greek Catholic priest Isaias Papadopoulos was made vicar general for the Greek Catholics within the jurisdiction of the Apostolic Delegation of Constantinople. The Greek Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul) was founded on June 11, 1911, as the Greek Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of European Turkey.Catholic Hierarchy: Apostolic Exarchate of Istanbul (Constantinople) At the same time, on June 28 (1911), Isaias Papadopoulos was appointed titular bishop of Gratianopolis,Catholic Hierarchy: Bishop Isaias Papadopoulos and he was also entrusted with the initial organization of the newly formed Exarchate, but he was not appointed apostolic exarch. That question had to be postponed because of the breakout of Balkan Wars (1912-1913) when the Ottoman Empire lost most of its European territory, and the consequent breakout of First World War (1914-1918). The first apostolic exarch, George Calavassy, was appointed only after the war, in 1920. On June 11, 1932, it lost territory to establish the Greek Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Greece.Catholic Hierarchy: Apostolic Exarchate of Greece (Greek) In 1936, it was renamed as Apostolic Exarchate of Istanbul or of Constantinople. On November 25, 1999, Bishop Louis Pel√¢tre, A.A., Apostolic Vicar of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Istanbul,Catholic Hierarchy: Louis Pel√¢tre was named apostolic administrator of the exarchate. On April 16, 2016, Fr. Rub√©n Tierrablanca Gonzalez, O.F.M, was named administrator of the exarchate, with the retirement of Bishop Pel√¢tre. He also holds the office of Apostolic Vicar of Istanbul.

Books =Nonfiction= The French critic and essayist Roland Barthes refers at least twice to a ship that is entirely rebuilt, in the preface to his Essais Critiques (1971) and later in his Roland Barthes par Roland Barthes (1975); in the latter the persistence of the form of the ship is seen as a key structuralist principle. He calls this ship the Argo, on which Theseus was said to have sailed with Jason; he may have confused the Argo (referred to in passing in Plutarch's Theseus at 19.4) with the ship that sailed from Crete (Theseus, 23.1). In the book Last Chance to See Douglas Adams discusses the Gold Pavilion Temple in Kyoto, which is an example similar to the Shinto shrine (discussed in the main article), and realised the following: :\\"The idea of the building, the intention of it, its design, are all immutable and are the essence of the building. The intention of the original builders is what survives. The wood of which the design is constructed decays and is replaced when necessary. To be overly concerned with the original materials, which are merely sentimental souvenirs of the past, is to fail to see the living building itself.\\" Theseus's paradox bears also on the question of virtual human identity discussed in Douglas Hofstadter's and Daniel Dennett's The Mind's I: Fantasies and reflections on self and soul (1981). Speculations concerning mind uploading suggest it is possible to transfer a human mind from an organic brain to a computer, incrementally and in such a way that consciousness is never interrupted, e.g. by replacing neurons one by one with electronics designed to simulate the neurons' firing patterns. Yet the result of this process is an object entirely physically distinct from the starting point. The Mishnah presents the paradox with various practical implications to Jewish law, and concludes that it is indeed considered as if it was a different object.Mishnah Kelim, 18:6 and 26:4; see also Babylonian Talmud, Eruvin 24a and Shabbat 112b =Fiction= In the Oz books by L. Frank Baum, the lumberjack Nick Chopper's axe chopped off all his limbs one by one, and each time a limb was cut off, a smith made him a mechanical one, finally making him a torso and a head, thus turning him into the Tin Woodman, an entirely mechanical being, albeit possessing the consciousness of the lumberjack he once was. In The Tin Woodman of Oz he seeks out his old girlfriend, to find that she has married Chopfyt, who was created partly from the leftover parts of Nick Chopper. In the novel John Dies at the End the starting chapter presents the experiment as a riddle with an axe that has its handle and its head replaced. In the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett: * In The Fifth Elephant, the dwarfish king compares changing a society's laws or customs to replacing components in an ancestral axe. * In Lords and Ladies, there are numerous references to the supposed inability of witches and wizards to cross the same river twice. The River Ankh in the city of Ankh-Morpork is the only river that is possible to cross twice because it is polluted and slow-moving to the point of being solid. The wizards refute this by demonstrating that an agile wizard can cross and recross a small river many times an hour. * Senior witch Granny Weatherwax possesses a flying broom whose handle and bristles have been replaced many times, yet remains unreliable to the point that she has to run up and down very quickly to essentially \\"bump-start\\" it. * Pratchett also directly references the paradox in The Bromeliad and The Carpet People. In Look to Windward by Iain M. Banks, the GSV Lasting Damage is itself a Ship of Theseus, partially destroyed and rebuilt, and this is key to the novel's plot. The short story The Man That Was Used Up by Edgar Allan Poe is about a man who reconstructs himself after going through a war. Robert Graves employs the \\"grandfather's axe\\" version of the paradox in his historical novel, The Golden Fleece, first published in 1945. Isaac Asimov's Bicentennial Man applies this to humanity; the title character being a robot gradually rebuilt by prostheses intended for humans. When contrasted with a human who has been \\"rebuilt\\" by the same prostheses, the question of the distinction between man and robot is explored. In the 1986 book Foundation and Earth by Isaac Asimov, the ancient robot R. Daneel Olivaw says that over the thousands of years of his existence, every part of him has been replaced several times, including his brain, which he has carefully redesigned six times, replacing it each time with a newly constructed brain having the positronic pathways containing his current memories and skills, along with free space for him to learn more and continue operating for longer. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams makes continuing sport of classic paradoxes. In the trilogy's fourth book So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish, Marvin the Paranoid Android says of himself: \\"Every part of me has been replaced at least fifty times...\\" (except for the diodes down his left side, which hurt). In the sixth book of the series, character Trillian has had so many body parts and functions replaced by technology that she doubts she is still the same person, referring to her present self as New Trillian and the past as Old Trillian. Japanese manga and animated series Ghost in the Shell cyclically returns to this paradox of a \\"human\\" in which people often have their organic body parts replaced by artificial parts, sometimes going so far as to have their entire body replaced with a prosthetic one, leaving the brain as the only remaining original part. The plot of the James Blish novel Spock Must Die!hinges on this philosophical dilemma. In Peter Watts' interstellar sci-fi novel Blindsight, the crew's ship is called Theseus. It features technology to create and replace its own parts when broken, and can heal and replace crew members' organs and tissue when they are injured. Likely hinted at in the Star Wars Legends novel Bloodlines by Karen Traviss. In the book, Boba Fett notes that the only original part of his ship Slave I that survives from his father's days was the pilot's chair. In the 2017 book Run Program, by Scott Meyer, when trying to trick the artificial intelligence which is the main antagonist of the story, one of the characters references the Ship of Theseus. When his reference can't be adequately explained, another character poses a thought experiment involving the transporters in Star Trek. She says when people use the transporter, a copy of themselves is made in the new location and the original is killed by the machine. In Land of The Lustrous, Phosphophyllite keeps losing pieces of themselves. When they lose their head, one of the gems questions if they should even call them Phos anymore.  Publications  In Michael Rea's Material Constitution, there is a scenario in which Socrates and Plato exchange the parts of their carriages one by one until, finally, Socrates's carriage is made up of all the parts of Plato's original carriage and vice versa. The question is whether, or at what point, they exchanged their carriages.Michael Cannon Rea (editor), Material Constitution: A Reader, Rowman & Littlefield, 1997, p. 210, This thought experiment is \\"a model for the philosophers\\": some say, \\"it remained the same,\\" others say, \\"it did not remain the same\\".Rea, M., 1995: \\"The Problem of Material Constitution,\\" The Philosophical Review, 104: 525-552. In Hans Moravec's Mind Children, an example of mind uploading is given - a human brain is replaced a single neuron at a time by a nanorobot and computer that perfectly simulates the behaviour of the neuron and its neurotransmitters. The end result is a completely digital copy of brain in simulation. However, there are other factors such as the fact that the intricate structure of the brain is changing as the brain learns, so a simulated brain may not learn the same way. In The Three Basic Facts of Existence, Piyadassi Thera uses the teachings of Dharma to suggest that nothing in the universe is ever the same: :\\"The same man cannot step twice into the same river; for the so called man who is only a conflux of mind and body, never remains the same for two consecutive moments\\". In Johann A. R. Roduit's poem 'Flesh & Foil', the imagery of the Ship of Theseus is used to illustrate the consequences human enhancements could have on someone's physical body.JAR Roduit. Flesh & Foil. Bio√©thiqueOnline. 2016, 5/15 Television series In the Open All Hours episode \\"Laundry Blues\\", originally aired 1 March 1981, store owner Arkwright extols the virtue of his old brush/broom - \\"That's a marvelous old brush, that! I've had it 14 years - that's only had 2 new heads and 3 new handles!\\" In the Only Fools and Horses episode \\"Heroes and Villains\\", the road sweeper Trigger declares he has won an award for keeping the same broom for 20 years ‚Äî \\"17 new heads and 14 new handles\\". In the 2011 documentary series Curiosity, an episode entitled \\"Can You Live Forever?\\", elaborates on the concept of replacing the human body, piece by piece. Adam Savage, the episode's host, presents the audience with several plausible scenarios. In An Idiot Abroad, Karl Pilkington ruminates over the restoration done to the Great Wall of China after discovering monkey bars that had been installed in the tourist area. Pilkington decides that the wall isn't very impressive because \\"it's not even the same bloody wall is it?\\" = Science fiction = In the Futurama episode \\"The Six Million Dollar Mon,\\" accountant Hermes Conrad replaces his body parts one by one with robotic ones. Dr. Zoidberg requests to keep the discarded body parts, fashioning them into a marionette of Hermes, which he uses for a stand-up routine. When Hermes goes to replace his brain with a robotic one, Zoidberg puts the old brain into his marionette body, bringing Hermes back to life as his old self and leaving his previous body to be taken over by the new brain. In Star Trek: * In the episode \\"Life Support\\" of the Deep Space Nine series, the complete replacement of the brain is considered the destruction of the individual.Life Support on Memory Alpha * The USS Enterprise, the starship featured in the original Star Trek television series, was very heavily refitted before its first appearance in film, the 1979 movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Almost nothing from the original TV version of the ship survived into the refitting. Captain Willard Decker, the ship's new commanding officer, describes it as \\"an almost totally new Enterprise.\\" * The philosophical question of whether life is merely the sum of its parts, or is more than this, is a discussion central to the transporters. In his book, The Physics of Star Trek, physicist Lawrence M. Krauss discusses whether the transporters would be required to transport a person's individual atoms, or merely the information regarding their state. This has come up in more than one episode in which a previous beaming stored in memory was used to restore an individual. In the Doctor Who episode \\"Deep Breath\\", the Doctor postulates that a broom that has had its handle and brush replaced several times is not the same broom, \\"but you can still sweep the floor\\", when talking to an android who has replaced every part of himself several times. This is often taken to be a loving in-joke reference to the above stated \\"Trigger's Broom\\" scene in another well-known BBC TV series \\"Only Fools and Horses\\". In the web original animated series Gen:Lock, the phrase \\"Ship of Theseus\\" is seen on a blackboard in a scene from episode 6, \\"The Only Me I Know,\\" and pertains to the question of personal identity that the protagonist faces when his consciousness is entirely separated from his physical body and uploaded into a computer. Films In the 1995 movie, Ghost in the Shell, the main character, a woman who has been \\"cybernetically augmented\\" to become nearly 100% robot, encounters an intelligent entity claiming to be indistinguishable from a human, who is actually a rogue A.I.; this causes the main character to question her own reality and the nature of a human or being 'alive' or synthetic; with respect to how much of a human can you replace before it ceases to be human, or how human a robot can be before it ceases to be a robot, in an age of synthetic and cybernetic replacement of humans parts on a grand scale. The 1999 movie Bicentennial Man, based on the novel, stars an android who develops a personality and replaces his entire physiology with cybernetic-organic parts, so that he is the same character but now mortal. In the 2008 animated film WALL-E, it is suggested that possibly every single piece of the character WALL¬∑E has been replaced by himself prior to the story. In the 2009 film, Gamer, Michael C. Hall's character Ken Castle develops a nanotechnology method to supplant one's biological central nervous system with a synthetic one, cell by cell. The percentage of supplanted cells in an individual's brain varied by character, depending on the desired function (i.e.- wirelessly receive information like a computer, or send it, in the case of Ken Castle). Although not fully expressed in any character of the film, Castle ultimately presents the audience with the concept of fully supplanting one's biological brain with an entirely synthetic one. Midway into the film, Theseus' Ship Paradox does come into question when the character of Gina Parker Smith (Kyra Sedgwick) shares that she would rather have the new parts removed, a statement that prompts Trace (Alison Lohman) to explain that such an attempt would kill the individual because it would mean removing a part of one's brain. The 2012 movie John Dies At The End based on the novel, begins with a narration recounting the axe variant of the paradox. The 2013 movie Ship of Theseus portrays the paradox through intertwined stories of human organ donation. Music Sugababes, a British band,Sugababes crown girl group list \\"were formed in 1998 [..] but one by one they left, till by September 2009 none of the founders remained in the band; each had been replaced by another member, just like the planks of Theseus‚Äôs boat.\\" The three original members reunited in 2011 under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan, with the \\"original\\" Sugababes still in existence. Membership of the British pop band The Pipettes has gradually changed such that none of the founding members are any longer part of the band. Yes no longer features any original members. Stratovarius was formed in 1984 under the name Black Water. The \\"classic line- up\\" (1996‚Äì2005) has no members in common with the founding line-up. Also, as of 2018, the current incarnation of the band has no members in common with the 1994 line-up that recorded Dreamspace; yet continuity was never broken. In Flames debuted in 1994 with \\"Lunar Strain\\". Also in this case, the \\"classic line-up\\" (1999‚Äì2011) has no members in common with the founding line-up. Founding guitarist Jesper Stromblad was the last remaining when he left in 2011. Vocalist Anders Frid√©n and guitarist Bjorn Gelotte, however, joined right after the debut and are still currently in the line-up. Mikael √Ökerfeldt is the only member on every Opeth album, being the band leader. However, he is not the band founder. Opeth was originally formed in 1989 by David Isberg and the group's earliest members were fired upon the arrival of √Ökerfeldt, with whom Isberg formally restarted the group as a two-piece in 1990. Isberg left the band in 1992. Opeth's first album, \\"Orchid\\", was released in 1995. Japanese idol groups such as AKB48 are often like this, employing new members as the older ones \\"graduate\\", eventually coming to a point where none of the original members are part of the group anymore. Or they distribute members into teams and rotate them around, eventually coming to a point where the team no longer has any of its original members. Guns 'n' Roses spent many years with Axl Rose as the only remaining member from the founding lineup. Three former GNR members eventually reunited as Velvet Revolver. GNR properly reunited n 2016. Amy Lee is currently the only original member of Evanescence who is still part of the band. Most of the band's classic lineup later reunited as We are the Fallen. Software Computer systems will sometimes split into two or more versions, such as when its programmers disagree and split into rival teams. This may happen in open source software as a fork, or commercially when company founders leave to create a new company doing similar work. This can lead to situations where, for example, one team retains the original name but the other retains most of the core people. One of the most famous examples was when the team responsible for making Diablo and Diablo II - David Brevik, Erich Schaefer, and Max Schaefer - quit Blizzard to form Flagship Studios, but Blizzard retained the rights to the Diablo name. Games The 2009 visual novel game Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors compares the paradox as well as the similar Locke's Socks paradox to one of the game's puzzles where the player has to swap body parts of two mannequins to match a certain weight for both of them. The 2013 game The Swapper's staple mechanic is a cloning device that allows the player to create perfect clones and swap consciousness between them. The majority of the game takes place aboard a spaceship named \\"Theseus\\", which is a heavy nod to the thought experiment's involvement in the game's use of themes such as the subject of consciousness and a lost sense of originality. The 2015 psychological horror game SOMA features dialogue and text records that presents the player with the paradox of the human body, as the cells of the body are all being replaced at different rates - the body and mind is always growing and changing. As every second passes, a person is never physically the same, but they always represent the same person, \\"a continuous flow of thought and perception keeps an unbroken chain of continuity that we know as our self\\". In Nier: Automata the supply trader in the resistance camp refuses to replace his broken leg since it is the last remaining original part and therefore part of his identity. Miscellaneous The contemporary writer Martin Cohen creatively imagined John Locke regarding a favorite sock that develops a hole. He pondered whether the sock would still be the same after a patch was applied to the hole, and if it would be the same sock after a second patch was applied, and a third, etc., until all of the material of the original sock has been replaced with patches. An instance known generally as grandfather's axe, where over time both the head and handle have been replaced, has been personified with the names of famous hatchet and axe wielders such as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. In Europe, several independent tales and stories feature knives that have had their blades and handles replaced several times, but are still used and represent the same knife. France has Jeannot's knife, Spain uses Jeannot's knife as a proverb, though it is referred to simply as \\"the family knife\\", and Hungary has \\"Lajos Kossuth's pocket knife\\". In Japan, Shinto shrines are rebuilt every twenty years with entirely \\"new wood\\". The continuity over the centuries is spiritual and comes from the source of the wood in the case of Ise Jingu's Naiku shrine, which is harvested from an adjoining forest that is considered sacred. In 2013, the shrine was rebuilt for the 62nd time. The question of identity posed by the Ship of Theseus remains problematic even in the 21st century, foremost with both the piecemeal and wholesale reconstruction of wooden boats and tall ships, as well as structures of historic merit and not. An illustrative example is the provenance of the USS Constellation, the identity controversy over which long vexed even respected naval historians and publications of record. Credible records allowed its history to finally be resolved, but many instances occur whether either records are lacking or the matter is simply one of point of view. The automobile restoration practice of resto-modding relies on the ship of Theseus not factoring, as all of a given car's fundamental mechanics and electronics are replaced.

The film, an adaptation of Peter Ackroyd's 1994 murder mystery novel Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem, stars Olivia Cooke, Bill Nighy, and Douglas Booth. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2016. It was released in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2017, by Lionsgate. Plot A series of murders has shaken the community of Limehouse in the docklands of Victorian London. Journalists seizing on the public taste for gore and melodrama dub the murderer the Golem, after the Jewish legend. When the music- hall star Elizabeth Cree is accused of poisoning her husband, John, on the same night as the last Golem murder, Inspector John Kildare discovers evidence linking John Cree to the Golem murders and wants to solve the cases before Elizabeth is hanged. Kildare finds a diary written by the Golem of the crimes, handwritten in a printed copy of the essay by De Quincey, On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts, in a collected volume in the reading room of the library in the British Museum. He deduces that the Golem must be one of the four men who were in the library on the date of the last entry; Dan Leno, Karl Marx, George Gissing and John Cree. Kildare acquires handwriting samples of the other three men, while listening to Elizabeth's story about how she was the daughter of an unmarried mother and went from sewing sail-cloths at the docks, to becoming a music-hall star. When Elizabeth's abusive mother died, she was befriended by Dan Leno and fell in with his music-hall troupe, performing bawdy comic songs while dressed as a man. Her act quickly becomes second in popularity only to Leno but she aspires to also become a dramatic actor. John Cree, a struggling playwright woos her, offering her a leading part in his new play. She does not respond to his advances but her fellow performer, Aveline Ortega (Mar√≠a Valverde), becomes jealous, especially since she herself is interested in John. Aveline sabotages Elizabeth's first dramatic role by telling her to say something offensive to her primarily Jewish audience. Elizabeth is entrapped by the theatre's owner, a man known as 'Uncle' (Eddie Marsan) and is forced to pose nude for photographs and to beat him for his sexual gratification. She tells John, who offers to marry her and keep her safe. Elizabeth accepts and Kildare notes that Uncle died suddenly only days later, leaving the theatre to Dan Leno. John's career stalls, and he grows bitter towards Elizabeth, who supports him financially, but is only interested in what he can do for her career. She hires Aveline as a maid and facilitates an affair between her and John so that she will not have to keep sleeping with him. Elizabeth discovers that John has lied about almost completing \\"Misery Junction\\" to spite her. The two remain estranged until John Cree's poisoning. Kildare finally finds a handwritten copy of the play written by Cree before his death on the day that Elizabeth is to be hanged. He compares the handwriting to the handwriting from the diary and finds the two to be a match. He gets an hour's postponement to her sentence, hoping that revealing John Cree's crimes will cause her sentence to be commuted. Kildare instructs her to write a statement, but she instead writes the confession \\"I am the Golem\\", her handwriting matching the writing from the diary. Kildare realises that she is the true Golem rather than her husband. She killed 'Uncle' and then began committing murders as the Golem to make a lasting name for herself, poisoning her husband when he found evidence of her crimes. Broken at this revelation, Kildare delays announcing the revelation that Cree was the Golem to the press until after Elizabeth is hanged, granting her the fame of eliminating the Golem rather than the greater fame of being a killer, which she would have desired more. In the final scene, Dan Leno's troupe perform John's play, rewritten to tell Elizabeth's life story. Aveline Ortega, playing the part of Elizabeth, dies accidentally during the hanging scene when the safety mechanism fails. Leno covers up the death and takes the curtain call dressed as Elizabeth to continue the play. He takes a bow on Elizabeth's behalf, as we no longer see him, but Elizabeth herself on the stage.

She explains, \\"What‚Äôs funny is that I read the book long before I was screenwriting. I think it was the only time that I can remember when I read a book and thought, 'Gosh, I hope somebody makes a movie of this!' ... Weirdly, years later I was on a film jury together with the producer whom I had read had the rights and I asked him whatever happened to the adaptation and said that I loved the book. That is how this came about, because he said the rights were free again and asked, 'Do you want to do it?'\\" It was announced on 17 April 2015 that Alan Rickman, Olivia Cooke, and Douglas Booth had been cast in leading roles for the film, to be directed by Juan Carlos Medina. Rickman later left the project due to declining health after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Principal photography for The Limehouse Golem began in October 2015 in West Yorkshire, with filming taking place in locations such as Leeds and Keighley. Production also took place in Manchester, with cast members Bill Nighy and Daniel Mays being spotted on set in Deansgate. Principal photography concluded on 26 November 2015. Johan S√∂derqvist composed the film's score. The film is dedicated to Rickman, who died in January 2016. Release The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2016. It was released in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2017 and in the United States on 8 September 2017, in a limited release and through video on demand by RLJ Entertainment. =Critical reception= The Limehouse Golem received positive reviews from film critics. It holds a 73% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 74 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.4/10.

Its present form evolved from the southwest movement of ice age glaciers over millions of years, the morainic drift heaping thousands of drumlins in the surrounding lowlands. Irish cultural folklore records strong association with the mythological \\"Tuatha De Dannan\\". Sliabh an Iarainn is an important natural heritage site with exposed marine and coastal fauna of paleontological interest Etymology The name , originates from an appreciation Iron ore deposits are present. Boate (1652) said \\"\\". Sliabh an Iarainn was anciently named \\"\\", the \\"mountain of the Conmaicne Rein in Connacht\\". The Irish name spelling is commonly used, though pronounced and corrupted as \\"Slieve-An- Ierin\\". Natural heritage site Goniatite Fossils at the shores of Lough Allen (Slieve Anierin) Goniatite Fossils Found on the Shores of Lough Allen Natural Ireland.Fossils Found on Lough Allen Sliabh an Iarainn is an important natural heritage site due to unbroken sequence of Carboniferous marine fossils present in the rock layers spanning the Namurian (326-315 million years ago) and lower Westphalian (313-304 million years ago) stages of the Silesian (series). The Geological survey of Ireland (1878) wrote ‚Äú‚Äù. In her landmark study \\"The Palaeontology of the Namurian rocks of Slieve Anierin, County Leitrim, Eire\\", Patricia Yates (1962) demonstrated a \\"remarkable extent\\" of Namurian marine fauna bands, abundant with goniatite-Bivalvia, at Sliabh an Iarainn. She described some rock layers as particularly fossiliferous, the shale bands abundant with goniatite faunas and Bivalvia marine and freshwater molluscs. The unfossiliferous shales often contain numerous clay-ironstone bands making conditions intolerable for marine organisms. At most of the fossiliferous levels in the Namurian beds the number of goniatites and Bivalvia are usually very high with the diversity of species low. The richest and most diverse band in the succession at Sliabh an Iarainn, in terms of species present, contains Trilobites, brachiopods, gastropods, echinoids and Bryozoa. Fragments of trilobites occur abundantly at particular bands. Overall, Yates documented nearly 120 distinct fossiliferous sites around Sliabh an Iarainn, her work complemented by extensive photographs of often beautifully preserved fossils. Her study of Sliabh an Iarainn is considered important, being housed at the Murchison Museum, Imperial College, British Geological Survey Museum, and the Natural Museum in London. Geography Sliabh an Iarainn is an imposing Hill in rural West Ireland, towering over and dominating the rugged landscape. It rises from the eastern shore of Lough Allen to a summit elevation of . On this summit at , a Triangulation station of the Ordnance Survey is fixed on a low concrete plinth. =Geology= Sliabh an Iarainn is composed of Carboniferous shales, and sandstones blanketed by heather-covered moorland, and located in an area of Upper Carboniferous rocks extending from the northern extremity of Lough Erne for about to the southern tip of Lough Allen. Shale is the dominant rock type throughout the Carboniferous succession, but a thick grit, with coal seams, occurs in the lower rock layers of 326-315 million years ago. At its greatest width the outcrop stretches eastwards towards Swanlinbar distant. The outcrop narrows northwards, interrupted by a deep shoreline indentation of Carboniferous Limestone around the Belcoo area, to the north of which it widens before rapidly narrowing towards Lough Erne. Sliabh an Iarainn, at the southern end of this mass, and east of Lough Allen, is a flat topped mountain with a prominent and steep grit slope, easily mistaken for the summit from a distance, when in fact another of shales form a small residual outlier overlying this grit. There is a thick obscuring mantle of peat bog and glacial drift below the steep grit slope, with heather and peat bog forming a thick mantle over most of the upland plateau at the summit. Rocks are typically horizontal or gently dipping, except in land-slipped areas. Impressive landslides have occurred along the western face, and at the south-western and south-eastern corners of the mountain, indicating an appreciative magnitude of land-slipping.

At the base of the succession occur limestones, calcareous mudstones, and sandstones, but from the base of the Namurian upwards shales are continuous until the millstone grit horizon. =Coal field= Sliabh an Iarainn is the most eastern part of the Connacht coal field. Well-marked escarpment lines are visible, partly exposed by lines of geological fault on all sides of the mountain valleys, the collapsed layers removed by denudation. The outcrop of two coal seams, crow coals with a sandstone roof and middle coal under a slate roof, are traceable some difficulty along the grit escarpment on the western side of Sliabh an Iarainn towards the Stony River valley, becoming completely obscured by drift deposits on the southern flanks, and on the eastern flanks to a mile North of Lough Nabellbeg continuing through the townlands of Sradrinagh and Cornamucklagh South obscured by a thick blanket of peat bog, becoming visible again further north on the western side of the hill at Cleighran More and Cleighran Beg where faults are evident. The outcrop of both coal seams is also traceable for along the south-eastern slopes of Bencroy. More than two coal seams may be present at Sliabh an Iarainn, though the only rocks observable over the coal seams (in the millstone grit) are the lower coal measure containing black and brown splintery shales of a considerable thickness at Bencroy to the east and Barnameenagh to the west. Heritage Disused Mineshaft near to Mullaghgarve and Moher, Leitrim; seems to be an entrance to one of the mining operations. =Literary project= The 'Sliabh an Iarainn project is a literary initiative started in 2004 to write about the history of the people who inhabited the necklace of town lands on the flanks of Sliabh- an-Iarainn and Ben Croy, in county Leitrim. The goal was to preserve a memory of the Ultachs, Catholic refugees displaced out of Ulster in 1795 who made a home on the mountain, their experiences of famine and emigration, and the resilience of the remaining communities. This social history was released in three volumes- * Mountain Echoes, Sliabh an Iarainn's Story (Vol. 1) * Mountain Shadows, Sliabh an Iarainn's Story (Vol. 2) * Mountain Roots, Sliabh an Iarainn's Story (Vol. 3) =Ulster Plantation= In the 1609 Plantation of Ulster, Sliabh an Iarainn formed part of lands which were granted to John Sandford of Castle Doe, Co. Donegal (the father-in-law of Thomas Guyllym of Ballyconnell) by letters patent dated 7 July 1613 (Pat. 11 James I ‚Äì LXXI ‚Äì 38, Slewenerin). It was later sold by Sandford to his wife's uncle Toby Caulfeild, 1st Baron Caulfeild, Master of the Ordnance and Caulfield had the sale confirmed by letters patent of 12 July 1620 (Pat. 19 James I. XI. 45 Slewnerin). =Muintir-Eolais lake= In the remote mountainous Cuilcagh- Anierin uplands, an oligotrophic lake called \\"Lough Munter Eolas\\" is named after Eolais Mac Biobhsach and the Muintir Eolais, the most famous of the Leitrim sub-septs of the Conmaicne Rein). This lake straddles the border of Moneensauran townland in west Cavan and Slievenakilla townland in south Leitrim. =Iron industry= Iron Ore has been dug at Sliabh an Iarainn since the 1600s, the Ore rather tough like Spanish Iron. Commercial Iron works existed around Sliabh an Iarainn , and though nearly all were destroyed during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, they were revived after the Irish Confederate Wars at the earliest, or in the 1690s after the Battle of the Boyne. Many smelting works employed English or other foreigners instead of Irish labour which generated much local hostility. The siting of Smelting works contiguous to Lough Allen allowed for the transportation of Pig Iron in boats of up to forty tons. Commercial iron mining declined after as deforestation exhausted the fuel for burning charcoal. Cornashamsoge Furnace Cornashamsoge townland In the 17th century the Cornashamsoge smelting works founded. Local tradition says \\"\\". Cornashameogue is overlooked by the adjacent townland of . Sliabh an Iarainn Leat Local folklore recalls a so-called \\"Sliabh an Iarainn canal\\" connected with Cornashamsoge smelting works- \\"\\". His description best describes a Leat rather than a canal. Drumshanbo Furnace After the ironstone melted, the Pig iron was brought to Drumshanbo Finery forge to the south of Lough Allen to produce the malleable iron product which was transported to Dublin and Limerick by boat. Folklore claims the \\"\\". Drumshanbo Iron works closed in 1765. Creevlea- The last place in Ireland where Iron was manufactured. Ballinamore Iron works Ballinamore Iron works was established sometime after 1693 and continued production until probably 1747 when the business was put up for sale, the assets including a furnace, forge, slitting mill, mine yards, coal yards, large quantities of pig iron, mine and coals. Creevlea Iron works The last Iron works in Ireland, located at Creevelea in county Leitrim, closed around 1770 though they reopened again years later again. Crevelea works ceased production in 1858, and later attempts to revive the industry here complete failures. Swanlinbar Iron works There was an Iron works at Swanlinbar in county Cavan right at the far north-east corner of Sliabh an Iarainn, though it had closed by 1785 according to an observer who wrote- \\"\\". =Coal industry= In 1962, an attempt to mine the lower thick coal-seam located about west of the Rocking Stone (\\"Fionn MacCumhaill‚Äôs Rock\\") was abandoned, the coal being poor quality and seams non persistent. On the eastern side of Sliabh an Iarainn there is another abandoned level in the upper seam which is thick, the location possibly being above Aughacashel House. =Ancient forest= Long ago Ireland had been covered in Woodland, a claim echoed by a 19th century survey of Leitrim- ‚Äú\\". These great forests in Leitrim and on the west side of Lough Allen were denuded for the making for Charcoal for Iron works around Sliabh an Iarainn. Immense piles of cleared timber existed at Drumshanbo in 1782. In mythology \\"The Two Ambassadors\\", by J. C. Leyendecker- Fir Bolg & Tuatha D√© Danann champions meet near Sliabh Comaicne, county Leitrim =Tuatha De Dannan= The Book of Invasions describes the Tuatha D√© Danann, tribe of the goddess Danu\\" arriving in Mesolithic Ireland through the air before landing their floating-ships on the summit of Sliabh an Iarainn, \\"\\". The men included Nuada the king, Manannan the powerful, Neit the battle god, and Goibniu the Smith. The women included Badb the battle goddess, Eadon the poets nurse, Brigit a goddess, and Dagna the goddess mother. Messengers informed Eochaid son of Ere, and king of the Fir Bolg, that a new race of people had settled in Ireland. The Firbolgs sent forward their champion Sreng and the Tuatha De Danann getting sight of his approach sent their champion Bres. The two champions had a meeting at Magh Rein below Sliabh an Iarainn but no peace was concluded. The Tuatha D√© Danann defeated the Firbolg at Battle of Moytura. Three centuries later the De Danann retreated to the Celtic Otherworld on being displaced by the Milesians, mythological ancestors of the Irish race. =Gob√°n Saor= Metal workers were held in high esteem, and the Irish Pantheon Gob√°n Saor is synonymous with the legendary Scandinavian named Vaeland Smith and Goibniu of the Tuatha De Dannan. According to oral tradition, Gob√°n Saor (\\"Goibhenen\\"), Tuatha De Danann metalsmith, worked the mines here. =Ancient aliens= Some fringe historians suggest a passage in the Book of Invasions concerning the appearance of the Tuatha D√© Danann in Ireland, records \\"\\" at Sliabh an Iarainn. =Hunger stone= Long ago in the parish of Kiltubrid the term (‚Äúhungry man‚Äù) was applied to a hunger which supposedly may inflict a person on the mountains, proving fatal if not quickly satisfied. This hunger immediately affected any person who walked on a legendary ‚Äú‚Äù at the base of Sliabh an Iarainn. =Fairies revenge= Oral tradition in Cavan described how a local man, \\"Turlough the Yellow-haired\\", asked the mountain fairies to destroy the Swanlinbar Iron works and send the foreigners away, and \\"\\".

Primary legislation generally consists of statutes, also known as 'acts', that set out broad outlines and principles, but delegate specific authority to an executive branch to make more specific laws under the aegis of the principal act. The executive branch can then issue secondary legislation (often by order-in- council in parliamentary systems, or by regulatory agencies in the American system), creating legally enforceable regulations and the procedures for implementing them.What is secondary legislation?  Canada  In Canadian law, primary legislation (also called statute law) consists of acts of the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces, and of Orders in Council made under the Royal Prerogative. Secondary legislation (also called regulation) includes laws made by federal or provincial Order in Council by virtue of an empowering statute previously made by the parliament or legislature. Civil law jurisdictions Civil law systems are almost universal in Europe, with the exceptions of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, as well as in Central and South America, much of Africa and Asia. In all cases, a parliament will issue primary legislation, with lesser bodies granted powers to issue delegated legislation. A judicial review may be provided by a constitutional court.  European Union  Each member state of the European Union (EU) has its own laws, and there is also overall EU law. The founding treaty, the 1957 Treaty of Rome, and all subsequent treaties, such as the Maastricht Treaty, Nice Treaty, and Lisbon Treaty, are the main primary legislation. The Treaty of Rome gives powers to make secondary legislation. Member states must surrender some national jurisdiction powers to the European Union; these delegated powers are exercised by the Commission, Council and European Parliament acting in concert, having consulted the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions. The powers are exercised via binding Regulations, Directives, Decisions, and non-binding Recommendations and Opinions. * A Regulation is a law which is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States without needing national implementation. EU citizens may have standing to pursue breaches of regulations and treaties, as in Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen. * A Directive is an order to Member States to pass legislation. It is \\"binding as to the result to be achieved\\", but Member States can choose their own form of implementation. EU citizens may have standing to pursue failures to implement, as in Francovich v Italy. * A Decision is a law that addresses a specific issue. Addressees may challenge a decision via Judicial Review. The Commission may take executive action in pursuance of policy, and may even act quasi-judicially in matters of EU competition law, a power defined in Article 101 and Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Privileged parties, such as Member States, EU Institutions, and those with specific standing, may initiate litigation. For example, the Commission may sue Member States for breaches of EU obligations, and Member States may sue Institutions or other Member States for breach of EU law.  Hong Kong  United Kingdom  = Primary legislation = In the United Kingdom, primary legislation can take a number of different forms: * An Act of Parliament. * An Act of the Scottish Parliament, Measure or Act of the Senedd or Act of the Northern Ireland Assembly * An Order in Council made under the Royal Prerogative * Church of England Measures ‚Äì the instruments by which changes are made to legislation relating to the administration and organisation of the Church. = Secondary legislation = In the United Kingdom, secondary legislation (also referred to as delegated legislation or subordinate legislation) is law made by an executive authority under powers delegated by an enactment of primary legislation, which grants the executive agency power to implement and administer the requirements of that primary legislation. Forms of secondary legislation in the United Kingdom include only: * Statutory instruments ‚Äì made in a variety of forms, most commonly Orders in Council, regulations, rules and orders. The form to be adopted is usually set out in the enabling Act.  United States  = Primary legislation = In the United States, primary legislation is, at the federal level, an Act of Congress, and the statute that delegates authority is called an authorizing statute or delegation of rule making authority. = Regulatory law = A law promulgated by the executive branch agency of the US government as the result of primary legislation is called a regulatory law, as legislation is used to refer only to acts of the legislative branch, never the executive or the judicial branches. The body of law that governs the agency's exercise of rule making and adjudication powers is called \\"administrative law,\\" primarily the Administrative Procedure Act.

EMU is expected to detect about 70 million radio sources.Norris, R.P., et al., EMU: Evolutionary Map of the Universe, PASA (2015), Volume 28, Issue 2, pp. 215-248. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PASA...28..215N compared to the 2.5 million radio sources currently known, most of which were detected by the NRAO VLA Sky Survey. Most of these radio sources will be galaxies millions of light years away, many containing massive black holes, and some of the signals detected will have been sent less than half a billion years after the Big Bang, which created the universe 13.7 billion years ago. Unlike the NVSS, which mainly detected active galactic nuclei, the greater sensitivity of EMU means that about half the galaxies detected will be star-forming galaxies. EMU's primary science driver is to try to understand how the stars and galaxies were first formed, and how they evolved to their present state. The census of 70 million galaxies detected by EMU will represent galaxies in all their different stages of evolution, so that they can be placed in sequence, enabling the study of how their properties change as they evolve. EMU will be able to probe star forming galaxies up to a redshift of about 1, active galactic nuclei to the edge of the observable universe, and will undoubtedly uncover new classes of object. EMU was chosen (with WALLABY) as one of the two highest-ranked proposals for ASKAP from an initial field of 39 expressions of interest.Johnston, S, et al., Science with ASKAP.

History  The EMU project was proposed in 2009 by a team led by Ray Norris. It was ranked by ASKAP in the top two of ten Survey Science projects, with Norris the Project Leader, and A. Hopkins and N. Seymour as Project Scientists. Seymour stepped down in 2018, and Norris stepped down in 2020. Currently, Andrew Hopkins is the Project Leader. The EMU team now has over 400 members.  Technical Overview  EMU is a radio sky survey project which will use the new ASKAP telescope to make a deep (~10 microJy rms) radio continuum survey covering the entire Southern Sky as far north as declination +30¬∞. It will have about 40 times the sensitivity, and six times the resolution, of the NVSS‚Äù, and will also be more sensitive to extended diffuse emission, because of the short baselines built into the ASKAP array. EMU will survey the entire sky visible from the ASKAP telescope in 30 square degree fields. Each field will be surveyed over the 300 MHz band from about 1110 to 1410 MHz, in 1 MHz channels, delivering both spectral shapes and, through the POSSUMGaensler, B. et al., Survey Science with ASKAP: Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society (2010), Vol. 42, p.515. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AAS...21547013G project, all four Stokes parameters and rotation measures. The data will be processed in near- real-time by the ASKAP pipeline processor. After the processed data have been approved for quality control by the EMU team, they will be placed in the public domain. The radio components will then be grouped into radio sources, and where possible cross-matched with other multiwavelength data. They will then be placed into the EMU value-added catalogue (EVACAT) which will be available only to members of the EMU team for some proprietary period before being released into the public domain. Timeline The EMU project has five phases (dates are notional, and depend on construction and commissioning progress): * EMU Phase 1: Design Study (2008-2015): The EMU design study examined issues such as simulating the performance of the phased-array-feed, developing high-dynamic-range imaging algorithms, source extraction and identification, etc. It also conducts pilot science experiments on fields such as the ATLAS, SCORPIO, and COSMOS fields, to guide the ultimate EMU science. * EMU Phase 2: BETA Commissioning (2013-2015) The EMU team contributed enthusiastically to the ASKAP Commissioning process, including using the 6-antenna Boolardy Test Array (BETA) to make the first observations, debugging the telescope and its processing. * EMU Phase 3: ASKAP-12 Commissioning: In 2016, a science-ready ASKAP (\\"ASKAP-12\\") was delivered with 12 of the 36 antennas equipped with ADE (\\"MkII\\") PAFs (in addition to the six antennas equipped with BETA PAFs, which are not expected to be used). A significant period of commissioning and debugging the instrument ensued. * EMU Phase 4: Early Science: The first survey science observations will be made with the ASKAP-12 array, starting in early 2016. A number of science projects were observed ed, resulting in a number of journal papers.. During this period the additional antennas were progressively equipped with PAFs. * EMU Phase 5: Pilot Survey. The EMU Pilot Field was observed in 2019-2020, resulting in several science papers in preparation. * EMU Phase 5: Full Survey Science: (2021?). The EMU survey observations themselves are expected to take 1.5 ‚Äì 2 years of telescope time. Its is hoped that EMU and WALLABY, the two top-ranked surveys, will observe commensally.

He is known as an advocate of rationalist architecture, which he applied with large schools such as the Lyc√©e Chaptal and Lyc√©e Voltaire. Early years Lyc√©e Chaptal, Train's best-known work Eug√®ne Train was born in 1832 in Toul, Meurthe-et-Moselle. He was admitted to the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs in 1850, and studied under Adolphe-Marie- Fran√ßois Ja√ø. In 1852 he moved to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, where he studied under Charles-Auguste Questel. Eug√®ne Train received the second Prix de Rome in 1859. He became one of the leaders of the rationalist school of French architecture, particularly with his educational buildings. Teacher Train became a tutor at the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs in 1855, and taught there until 1899. He was a director of the school between 1870 and 1899. Train was a demanding teacher. He constantly complained about the lack of education of his pupils, who were required only to be able to read and write. In 1874 he proposed that, at least for the architecture course, there should be an entrance examination in geometry. This was resisted by Laurent-Jan, who did not want any obstacles to admission to his school. Train also asked in 1874 whether the school could teach students the basic principles of fabrication and coloration so they could design carpets, wall hangings and stained-glass windows. This represented a new departure for the school, which had avoided specialized training until then. Architect Lyc√©e Voltaire Train became an architect of the city of Paris in 1863. Between 1863 and 1876 he designed and oversaw construction of the new Lyc√©e Chaptal. The original premises of the school were irregular in plan and too cramped for the student body. Train was selected to build the new school following specifications defined by the city. Construction started in 1866, but was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Work resumed in 1871 and was completed in 1876. Train was architect of the Lyc√©e Voltaire on the Avenue de la R√©publique. Construction began in 1885. The school accommodated 1,200 pupils, of whom 500 were boarders. The decorations of the building included metal and ceramics. Eug√®ne Train was made a knight of the Legion of Honour. He died in Annecy in 1903 at the age of 71.

Unraced as a juvenile, he won three of his four races in 2014 without being tested against top-class opposition. As a four-year-old he emerged as one of the best horses in North America with win in the Woodward Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. He was retired at the end of the season with a record of six wins and two places in eight starts. Background Liam's Map is a gray horse bred in Kentucky by the Albaugh Family Stable. He was sired by the Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Unbridled's Song from whom he inherited his gray color. Unbridled's Song's other major winners have included Zensational, Unrivaled Belle, Will Take Charge, Midshipman and Eight Belles. Liam's Map's dam Miss Macy Sue was a successful racemare who won eleven of her twenty-five races including the Grade III Winning Colors Stakes at Churchill Downs in 2007. She was descended from the champion sprinter Ta Wee who was a half sister to Dr Fager and to the broodmare Magic whose descendants included Unbridled. As a yearling Liam's Map was consigned to the Keeneland sales and bought for $800,000 by St Elias Stables. He entered the ownership of Teresa Viola Racing Stables and was sent into training with Todd Pletcher. Racing career =2014: three-year-old season= Liam's Map began his track career in a maiden race over seven furlongs on August 23 at Saratoga Race Course. Ridden as in all of his 2014 starts by John Velazquez he took the lead in the stretch but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten two and a quarter lengths by the favored Three Alarm Fire. On September 26 the colt started favorite for a one-mile maiden at Belmont Park and opened his winning account as he took the lead in the stretch and drew away to come home nine and a half lengths clear of Point Hope. Liam's Map next appeared in a one-mile allowance race at Aqueduct Racetrack on November 16 and recorded another emphatic win, finishing eleven and a half lengths clear of his six opponents. On his final appearance of 2014, Liam's Map was matched against older horses in the Harlan's Holiday Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Gulfstream Park on December 13 and started favorite ahead of Pants On Fire, a six-year-old who had won four Graded stakes races and finished third to Goldencents in the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. The colt took the lead exiting the backstretch and got the better of a sustained struggle with the four-year-old gelding Valid to win by half a length. =2015: four-year-old season= Liam's Map began his second season on June 19 at Belmont when he started odds-on favorite for an allowance race over one mile. Ridden by Javier Castellano he led from the start and won by one and a half lengths from the five-year-old gelding Confrontation, to whom he was conceding six pounds. The colt was then moved up sharply in class for the Grade I Whitney Stakes over nine furlongs at Saratoga in August and started 5/1 fourth choice behind Tonalist, Honor Code and Lea. Ridden by Mike Smith, he led from the start and kicked four lengths clear in the straight but was caught in the final stride and beaten a neck by Honor Code. After the race Pletcher said \\"He ran unbelievably well, setting those fractions to start and being there to the end. He just couldn't hold off a really good horse\\". On September 5 at Saratoga, Castellano resumed his partnership with Liam's Map when the colt started favorite for the Grade I Woodward Stakes. His main rivals appeared to be Effinex (Suburban Handicap), Wicked Strong, Protonico (Alysheba Stakes) and Coach Inge (Brooklyn Handicap). Liam's Map led from the start, drew away from his rivals in the straight and won easily by four and three quarter lengths from Coach Inge with Wicked Strong in third. Pletcher commented \\"I'm just happy to see him get that Grade I that he deserves so much... he has that style where he can get into a cruising speed and just keep carrying it... He just gets into that rhythm and he just runs horses off their feet\\". At the Breeders' Cup meeting at Keeneland, Liam's Map's connections opted to miss a clash with American Pharoah in the Classic and instead contest the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile on 30 October. Shortly before the race it was announced that an interest in the horse had been bought by Lane's End and that Liam's Map would be retired to the Versailles, Kentucky-based stud for the 2016 season. In the Dirt Mile, Liam's Map started 1/2 favourite against ten opponents headed by Lea, with the others including Red Vine, Wicked Strong, Bradester (Monmouth Cup), Tapiture (runner-up in the race in 2014), War Envoy (Britannia Stakes), Mr Z (Ohio Derby) and Valid. Castellano tracked the leaders as Bradester set the pace before switching out to make his challenge in the straight. Liam's Map overtook Lea inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a half lengths. Lea took second, three and a quarter lengths ahead of Red Vine who was in turn three and a quarter lengths clear of Wicked Strong in fourth. Castellano explained that he had intended to lead from the start and had to change his tactics when the colt did not break as quickly as expected. He commented \\"In this game you have to have a Plan B. I think the key was patience. He waited behind horses and it was phenomenal. He showed great skill. He can run on the pace or off the pace. I had to fight a little to put him behind horses, but when he was in the clear, he exploded\\". In the Eclipse Awards for 2015, finished runner-up to Honor Code in the poll for American Champion Older Dirt Male Horse receiving 95 votes to his rival's 126.  Stud career  After Liam's Map's victory in the Breeders' Cup Mile, Lane's End Farm announced publicly that they had acquired the rights to stand him as a stallion, alongside Eclipse Award nominee Honor Code, beginning in 2016. His initial stud fee was set at $25,000. Liam's Map's first winner came on July 21, 2019 when bay colt Basin won a six furlong maiden special weight at Saratoga. The colt is out of Appenzell, a daughter of Johannesburg, who also produced millionaire Rise Up by Rockport Harbor. Basin would go on to become his sire's first graded stakes or stakes winner when he won the Grade I Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga. The Steve Asmussen-trained colt took the lead down the stretch and drew away to win by 6 1/2 lengths on a sloppy track.

Bramson spent her early life in Denmark and her later life in France. She was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur for her work during the First World War and for her contributions to French literature. Early life in Denmark Karen Adler was born on August 10, 1875, in T√•rb√¶k, Denmark with parents Julius Frederick Adler a wealthy cigar merchant in Copenhagen and Dorothea (Thea) Monies a second cousin of the physicist Niels Bohr. She had several siblings, one of which was her elder brother, David Julius Adler. Karen was apparently a better writer than David, because she would sometimes write David Adler's school essays for him. Karen Adler started writing plays at the age of 12 and at 14, had a play in two acts - \\"Veninder\\" (Girlfriends) and \\"I pension for unge piger\\" (In a boarding house for young girls) - accepted at the Folketeatret (People's Theatre) in Copenhagen for a fee of 200 Danish Kroner. She had insisted that she should remain anonymous, but the theatre director could not resist giving her name to the local newspaper. Karen hurriedly withdrew her play and refunded the fee to avoid scandal and her father's wrath, for in 1890s Copenhagen, it was unheard of for a young lady of her class to attract such publicity and get paid for writing a play. In 1893, at the age of 17, Karen Adler married Louis Bramson (b. 1861 - d 1952). Louis, like Karen, came from a relatively prosperous Danish family, was a doctor and was 15 years older than Karen. In 1895 they had a son, Mogens Bramson. Karen Bramson continued to write and made her d√©but in print with the two plays \\"Den unge Frue. Mands Vilje\\" (The young lady - Man's Will) published in 1900 and performed in 1907 at the People's Theatre in Copenahgen. In 1904, Karen and Louis Bramson built a country mansion which they called Solg√•rden (Sun Yard) near the sea in Str√∏by Egede, Stevns Municipality just south of Copenhagen. They invited artists from different parts of Europe and held plays on a stage they had built there. King Frederick VIII of Denmark is said to have stayed there in 1911 and, in commemoration, is said to have presented Karen with four marble statues of eagles which were placed on the corners of a tower in the building. In 1912, Karen Bramson was elected a councillor of Copenhagen Municipality but declined, preferring to concentrate on writing. In 1914, Karen Bramson left Denmark and moved to France in a personal protest against Denmark remaining neutral during the World War I. She was to spend the rest of her life in France. Later literary career After Karen Bramson settled permanently in Paris, France at the beginning of the First World War, she wrote mostly in French. During the war, she was attached to the press department of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which tried to create international awareness of the country's situation. Bramson was an enthusiastic writer and propagandist for the French cause and tried to help the plight of French prisoners of war in Germany. She was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the L√©gion d'honneur in 1917 for the work she did during the First World War. After the war, her greatest triumph was the performance in 1923 of her play \\"Le Professeur Klenow\\" at the Theatre de l'Odeon in Paris(2015) R√©pertoire Od√©on Th√©√¢tre de l'Europe, Paris, Retrieved 3 June 2015 with actor Poul Reumert in the lead role. Later in 1923 there was a reworked version of her 1902 play, \\"Den St√¶rkeste\\" (The Strongest), as guest performance at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. Shortly before, at the same theatre, her play \\"De evige Fjender\\" (The Eternal Enemies) with Reumert and the actress Bodil Ipsen in the lead roles met with limited success. However, in June 1924 the same play translated into English with the title \\"Tiger Cats\\" and starring Edith Evans, Nicholas Hannen and Robert Loraine was performed at the Garrick Theatre and then the Royal Strand Theatre in London, where it was much more successful and ran for 116 performances. \\"Tiger Cats\\", directed by David Belasco also ran for 48 performances in the Belasco Theatre on Broadway in New York with Katharine Cornell and Robert Lorraine in the lead roles. Other plays by Karen Bramson performed about this time were \\"The Strong\\" at the Forty-Ninth Street Theatre, New York (1924) and in England \\"Medusa\\" (1926), \\"The Godless\\" (Wyndhams theatre December 1925), \\"The Enchantress\\" (The Garrick Theatre April 1926), \\"The Man they Buried\\" (The Ambassadors Theatre June 1928) and \\"The Tower of Babel\\" (Venturers Society July 1929). \\"Tiger Cats\\" was revived at the Royalty theatre in May 1931 with Edith Evans and Robert Lorraine in the same roles as before. In 1925 she was the first foreign female author to have a play accepted at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in Paris. Other plays of hers performed in Paris included \\"Puissance de Roi\\" (Od√©on Theatre), \\"Des yeux qui s'ouvrent\\" (also at the Od√©on) and \\"Bonheur\\" (Ambassadeurs theatre). She was made an Officer in the L√©gion d'honneur in 1927 because of her contributions to French literature and plays. In 1934 she also received the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat Danish award. Karen Bramson was known in fashionable circles in Paris had a reputation for being a brilliant hostess inviting artists, diplomats and politicians to receptions in her house. For example, she was friends with the poet and diplomat Saint-John Perse (who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature), the diplomat Philippe Berthelot, his wife H√©l√®ne and the French politician Louis Barthou. Despite her versatile talents, her literary ambitions and a life in the media spotlight, her inner personality was mostly hidden. She disliked giving interviews and was reticent about divulging details of her personal life. Final years and Death In her final years she retired from public life and studied spiritualism. She had always loved a cosmopolitan life and travelled throughout Europe staying in various hotels before dying in 1936 of a cerebral hemorrhage in a hotel room in Paris. Her ashes were buried at the P√®re Lachaise cemetery in Paris. Reception and legacy Her first plays (\\"The Young Lady\\", \\"Man's Will\\" in 1900 and \\"Mothers\\" in 1901 ) have been described as focussing on the oppression women suffer in marriage and she often explored themes of interpersonal relationships and the battle of the sexes. Deadly love and female masochist tendencies have also been mentioned by reviewers. One newspaper review of her play \\"Tiger Cats\\" noted the London audience \\"...consisting mainly of middle-aged, unmarried women cheered wildly these scenes of sadism.\\" She has also been described as a feminist and a writer of science fiction in the near future. In 1932 she was regarded by some critics as \\"the most significant figure in Nordic literature since Ibsens time.\\" The opinion of The Times obituary in January 1936 was that she was perhaps more successful as a novelist than a playwright \\\\- in particular for her books \\"Parmi les hommes\\" (a vast fresco of Europe before and after World War 1 including the curious character of Lenin), \\"Un seul homme\\" (an analysis of an English revolutionary), \\"Nous les barbares\\" (a study of middle-class life of her day) and \\"Star\\" (the story of a young girl and Hollywood). Bramson's family Karen Bramson and her husband Louis Bramson had one son Mogens Louis Bramson After 1914, she lived apart from her husband, but had a friendly relationship with him throughout her life. She adored her son Mogens, who was a pilotMulder, Rob J.M., (24 November 2011) Skywriting - Mr. Bramson above Christiana (Oslo) European Airlines, reprinted from original article in \\"Flight\\" magazine 21 June 1923, Retrieved 13 May 2015 and aviation engineering consultant. Mogens Bramson lived much of his life in England and played a crucial role in helping Frank Whittle develop the world's first jet engine. Later in his life Mogens moved to California, USA where he invented a heart lung machine. \\"..The instrument, which assists the heart and lungs, is known as the Bramson lung, named for its designer, Mogens L. Bramson, an engineer. Although the device warms blood and enriches it with oxygen, 50 to 60 per cent of the patient's blood can still be pumped by the natural heart. The patient thus retains his natural pulse. Dr. J. Donald Hill of Presbyterian Hospital of Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, says the Bramson lung buys time for damaged lungs to heal. Standard heart-lung machines may lead to blood damage when used for longer than six hours...\\" One source says Karen Bramson's older sister Olga married the Russian Prince Vladimir Orloff.

The movie failed to turn a profit during its initial release, but after Williams became a star on the hit TV show Mork & Mindy, producer Mike Callie spent two weeks in December 1978 sorting through the deleted footage until he located the \\"lost\\" Robin Williams scenes, then edited them back in and re-released the film with Williams being given top billing. Williams and his management took legal action against Callie and the film distributor for \\"false and misleading advertising,\\" and during a court hearing Callie agreed to modify the newspaper and TV ads so they would no longer imply that Williams was the star of the film.

He was also a member of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention in 1853, and from 1854 to 1859 was one of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University, from which institution he had received a doctorate in divinity in 1850, as well as from Union College in 1849. A colleague pastor was settled in 1857. In 1872 he resigned his charge, continuing, however, to be connected with the church as pastor emeritus until his death. In 1883 he removed to New York City, to spend his remaining days in the home of a married daughter, and there he died very suddenly, of heart- disease, December 17, 1884, in his 83rd year. He married, June 8, 1831, Miriam, younger daughter of the Hon. John Phillips of Boston, who died April 26, 1874.

It inhabits the eastern Atlantic Ocean (North Sea to South Africa), the Mediterranean Sea and the south-western Indian Ocean. Description The common eagle ray reaches up to in total length and has a disc width up to .Muus, B., J. G. Nielsen, P. Dahlstrom and B. Nystrom (1999). Sea Fish. p. 76. It has a rhomboidal disc with a pair of large, triangular pectoral fins projecting on either side, and a single dorsal fin. The snout is rounded and the tail slender, with a large spine at its base but no tail fin. The dorsal surface is brown or black while the ventral surface is white. Distribution and habitat This ray occurs in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the United Kingdom southward to South Africa, including the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It also occurs in the Indian Ocean, ranging from Kenya to South Africa. It occurs both close to the shore and further out, at depths down to about , but much of its time is spent in very shallow water at less than . Ecology The species largely feeds on crustaceans and bivalve molluscs that it excavates from the seabed. Other items in its diet include polychaete worms, gastropod molluscs, sea pens and small fish. Instead of having pointed teeth, it has flattened hexagonal bars and plates arranged in a mosaic pattern on its jaws; with these, it crushes the shells of its prey. Reproduction is oviviviparous. A clutch of three to seven young develop inside the mother, receiving nourishment at first from their egg yolks, but later from fluids secreted by their mother into her uterus. Status The taxonomic position of this fish is unclear as populations in the Mediterranean Sea may be a different species from those in the southeastern Atlantic. In the Gulf of Lion in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, populations declined in the 1970s, and there and elsewhere in the Mediterranean, the fish is under threat from intensive fishing. Along the coast of West Africa it is also the subject of artisanal fishing activities but these are less intensive and populations may be steady. The taxonomic uncertainty and the lack of data on populations of this fish has caused the International Union for Conservation of Nature to rate it as \\"data deficient\\".

The awards, presented once each year, include a federal grant for research and education activities for five consecutive years.  History  The Presidential Young Investigators (PYI) program was initiated in 1983, and remained active until the NSF New Young Investigators (NYI) program replaced it in 1992. Both programs were research-oriented, and funded an average of 200 faculty members per year. Another, more selective program began in 1992, when the White House asked NSF to institute the Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) program. It awarded young faculty up to $100,000 per year for five years, with no matching-fund option, and put more emphasis on education and outreach. In 1994, the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program was approved by NSF's National Science Board, and the first awards were presented in FY 1995. Several existing NSF programs and their objectives were merged into CAREER. In 1996, the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) program was instituted, replacing the PFF Awards. Beginning in FY 1997, the NSF selected nominees from among the \\"most meritorious first-year CAREER awardees supported by the CAREER program.\\" The same year, the CAREER program announcement termed CAREER \\"a premier program.\\" When a CAREER awardee is granted a PECASE award, funding is raised to a maximum of $500,000 over a five-year period.

She writes and lectures extensively about superstition, cryptozoology, religion and belief in the paranormal, with special regard to the folklore, psychology and sociology behind these phenomena, and has been introduced as a \\"vampire expert\\". Hyde has also worked in the motion picture industry. Early life Hyde's interest in the supernatural stems from her childhood and she attributes it to \\"having spent too much time with mad aunties\\". While other girls are usually interested in fairies and angels, she has always been fascinated by \\"dark stuff\\". She started out believing, but that changed with her discovering The Black Arts by occult writer Richard Cavendish, which made her apply a more analytic approach to these phenomena. Career outside of scepticism For years Hyde was in the business of distributing collectibles, during which time she spent a few years in New York City. That period was followed in the 1990s by her activities as a coordinator and production manager in various departments, including creature and makeup effects, as well as set construction. =Contributions to the film industry= Hyde has contributed to several motion pictures as a staff member and coordinator in the makeup department, responsible for prosthetics and creature effects, including for the horror films Doghouse and 1408. She was creature effects coordinator for the drama On a Clear Day. Hyde has also had several on-screen roles, appearing in Doghouse as the barmaid, and as the Corpse Queen in The Brothers Grimm. She also contributed to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as a tendril of the magical strangling Devil's Snare plant. In 2013 Hyde was the producer of the short film \\"Wisdom\\", in which she voiced one of the characters, and in 2018, she was the co-executive producer of the short film September Man. Career as a sceptic Hyde lecturing on The Restless Ghost of Wroc≈Çaw at the European Skeptics Congress 2017 Hyde started to research and write about belief in the supernatural in the 1990s, and initially blogged under the name \\"Jourdemayne\\". This nom de plume was borrowed from a 15th-century woman, also known as the \\"Witch of Eye\\" who was eventually burnt for witchcraft in Smithfield, London in 1441. The persona was chosen by Hyde because \\"she was sought by many for her knowledge of dark matters\\". Hyde's current website, deborahhyde.com, features blogposts and videos in which she takes an investigative approach to the interconnectedness of folklore, belief systems, and fear from unknown, natural phenomena. Her previous website, jourdemayne.com, was replaced in 2018. In her public appearances and writings, the following supernatural phenomena have been covered extensively: * Werewolves * Vampires * Witches * Demons * Ghosts * Fairies * Krampus =Public appearances across the UK= Hyde presenting the Ockham Editor's Choice Award to Crispian Jago at QED 2016. Hyde has been invited to speak at several different events including Skeptics in the Pub gatherings all across the UK (Winchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Wycombe, Manchester, Greenwich, etc.) as well as the international sceptics convention \\"QED - Question, Explore, Discover\\" in Manchester, where she is a regular speaker. Hyde has spoken twice at the \\"Skeptics on the Fringe\\" in Edinburgh with two of her lectures, \\"Interview With a Vampire Expert\\" and \\"The Natural History of the European Werewolf\\", both of which were received well with the sceptical audience. =International appearances= Hyde's talks at conventions outside the UK have been given mostly in the US, including a post- Halloween public lecture on \\"The Natural History of the European Werewolf\\" for the New York City Skeptics, and an appearance with the same talk at Skepticon-5 in Springfield. She has also been invited to the Ratio Forum for Popular Science in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2013 where she gave a talk on Vampires and attended a panel discussion along with Susan Blackmore. In 2017, Hyde delivered a presentation about The Restless Ghost of Wroc≈Çaw at the 17th European Skeptics Congress at the University of Wroc≈Çaw, Wroc≈Çaw Poland. In 2018, Hyde delivered a presentation about the historical roots of vampire folklore in Eastern Europe at CSICon in Las Vegas, Nevada. =Involvement in the Enfield Poltergeist case= In 2011, Hyde was asked to take part in a discussion on This Morning on ITV1 as an expert, representing the sceptical viewpoint about the Enfield Poltergeist case from 1977. Janet Hodgson, who had been a child at the time of the case, also made a rare appearance on the show, along with Guy Lyon Playfair, both of whom were deeply insulted by the rationalistic comments Hyde made during the discussion. This resulted in Lyon Playfair posting on his blog concerning this. This situation eventually led Hyde to write about the case and its background, providing a general explanation and several examples regarding why people fabricate malevolent figures. =Managing editor of The Skeptic= Deborah Hyde presenting James O'Malley and Liz Lutgendorff of The Pod Delusion with the Editors' Choice award at the 2013 Ockam Awards' Ceremony in Manchester, held as part of QEDcon 2013 In 2011, Hyde was appointed managing editor of The Skeptic, a UK magazine promoting science and critical thinking, succeeding Lindsay Kallis and many sceptics who had been editors in the past, including Chris French and founder of the magazine Wendy M. Grossman. The first issue of the magazine under her control was Volume 23 Issue 2 in 2011. As editor-in-chief, Hyde has been working with an international advisory board of experts from many different fields, some of whom are globally recognised scientists, science educators and science enthusiasts, including Susan Blackmore, Stephen Fry, Derren Brown, Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins, Edzard Ernst, Robin Ince, PZ Myers, Phil Plait, Massimo Polidoro, Simon Singh, James Randi and Richard Wiseman. =The Ockham and Rusty Razor awards= In 2012, Hyde proposed the idea of a prize that could be given to those with serious achievements within different fields of sceptical activism, in order to provide recognition to people investing large amounts of work in promoting science and scepticism. Starting that year, the Ockham Awards Ceremony has been an annual event at \\"QED - Question, Explore, Discover\\". The prize is officially awarded by The Skeptic magazine in several categories, agreed upon by a committee featuring sceptics including Chris French, Richard Wiseman, Wendy Grossman, Jon Ronson and Simon Singh. In 2017, the \\"Rusty Razor\\" Award, an ignoble recognition for \\"bad thinking\\", was added to the proceedings. =Other activities as a sceptic= Hyde was co-convenor of Westminster Skeptics, and acts as a speaker-liaison of the Soho Skeptics, an independent think tank involving several organisations, writers, film- makers, podcasters to promote talks, panel discussions and other events in the London area. =Upcoming book= In a 2018 interview with Susan Gerbic, Hyde revealed that she is writing a book to be called Unnatural Predators that explores common themes in human folklore throughout history using a combination of historical, psychological, and anthropological perspectives. Awards and honors In 2017, Hyde was elected as a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, a program of the Center for Inquiry in recognition of her work in sceptical media and events.

Biography James was a son of Alfonso Fadrique, vicar-general of Athens and Neopatras, and Marulla of Verona. As the Papacy supported the claims of Walter VI of Brienne on the Duchy of Athens, James (along with his father and his brother Peter) was among the Catalan leaders excommunicated on 29 December 1335 by William Frangipani, Latin Archbishop of Patras. In accordance with their father's will, James succeeded in the domains of his older brother Peter‚Äîthe County of Salona, the baronies of Loidoriki, Veteranitsa, and perhaps Zetouni‚Äîafter the latter died childless sometime before 1355. These possessions had been confiscated by the Crown of Aragon a few years before, but James was apparently successful in securing their return through the mediation of an embassy sent by the Catalan lords of Greece to King Frederick III. The same embassy petitioned to remove the incumbent vicar- general, Raymond Berardi, and to install James in his stead, but it is unclear whether this request was granted. If James was made vicar-general, by 1359 he had lost the position to Gonsalvo Xim√©nez of Aren√≥s. In 1361‚Äì62, James faced the hostility of the new vicar-general, Peter of Pou, who seized the castles of Salona, Loidoriki, and Veteranitsa, before he was killed in an uprising in 1362. In 1365, James seized the fortress of Siderokastron from the marshal Ermengol de Novelles, who had been declared rebel for refusing to surrender it to the appointed vicar-general, Matthew of Moncada. James then kept the castle for himself. James died in 1366, and was succeeded by his son Louis at Zetouni and Siderokastron. James had also willed to his brother \\"all his rights and properties\\" in the Duchy of Athens, including Salona, Loidoriki, and Veteranitsa. James also gave the island of Aegina to Boniface, who granted it to his son Peter. Boniface and Louis soon were at odds, and after a brief armed conflict in ca. 1375 Louis emerged victorious and dispossessed his uncle and cousin.

The earliest structural evidence for the palace dates it to about 1300, and the earliest written references to it date to the 14th century. However, its site may have been in use for similar purposes since the Anglo-Saxon period, and it may have been the earliest such residence outside Canterbury. Archbishop John Morton (1486‚Äì1500) rebuilt the palace, adding a five-storey tower of brick, and Thomas Cranmer was visited there by King Henry VIII in 1544. In 1573 Archbishop Matthew Parker proposed to demolish it, but it survived to be surveyed in 1647 by commissioners acting on the instructions of the Long Parliament, which had acquired it from the Church of England. The survey found the palace to be in fair condition, but it was largely demolished and the materials sold by order of Parliament in 1658, while the see of Canterbury was vacant. Its site was returned to the Church after the Restoration. In 1661, what remained of it was described as so ruined that its chapel was in use as a barn. Toponymy \\"Ford\\" is a common place-name element in England, and refers to a shallow crossing of a river or stream. In this instance it refers to a location about south-west of the site of Ford Palace, where a stream was crossed by a Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver. History Manuscript map showing Ford Palace and Park, possibly drawn in 1624: north is at the top. =Origin= The earliest evidence of human occupation in the vicinity of Ford consists of two Lower Palaeolithic hand axes found on a hilltop about to the south-south-west of the site of Ford Palace, across the stream from the crossing of which the place takes its name, and on the opposite, western side of the Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver. Five 2nd-century, Roman cremation burials were found near the same location. A fragment of a Roman inscription and a number of Roman coins have been found on the site of the palace, and, about to the south, in a field on the eastern side of the Roman road and also south of the stream, cropmarks have been observed indicating the probable site of a Roman villa. Finds from the Anglo- Saxon period include a claw beaker and a drinking cup retrieved from a sand pit also to the south of the stream, between the site of Ford Palace and that of the cremation burials. Antiquarians such as the 18th-century clergyman John Duncombe believed that King √Üthelberht of Kent moved his royal court from Canterbury to Reculver ‚Äì about north-east of Ford ‚Äì in about 597, and built a palace on the site of the Roman ruins there. However, archaeological excavation has shown no evidence of this, and √Üthelberht's connection with Reculver may be no more than a product of legend. In 2001 the historian Harold Gough noted speculation that the king may instead have taken up residence at Ford, since it lay on the Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver, and was included in the estate centred on Reculver that was given by King Ecgberht of Kent to Bassa the mass-priest for the foundation of St Mary's Church, Reculver, in 669. Ford was also included in the Reculver estate when King Eadred gave it to Archbishop Oda of Canterbury in 949. In 1800 the historian Edward Hasted wrote that Ford Palace \\"appears to have been the most antient palace, excepting that of Canterbury, which had been erected for the archiepiscopal residence\\", described it as \\"parcel of the antient possessions of the see of Canterbury\\", and placed its establishment \\"probably on lands given to [the archiepiscopate] sometime before the Norman conquest\\". Gough noted further that there is not \\"a shred of documentary or archaeological evidence\\" for the palace's existence in the Anglo-Saxon period. The first indication of the existence of an archiepiscopal residence at Ford is in documents issued there in the 14th and 15th centuries., citing . However, part of the main structure that stood until 1964 \\"embodied a string-course scroll moulding which suggested a late-Decorated date of around 1300\\", and there may have been an earlier, moated site adjacent to the palace's southern side. =Archbishop Morton= Although no relevant documentation survives, a major phase of construction work at Ford Palace is attributed to Archbishop John Morton (1479 ‚Äì 1500). Hasted believed that Morton \\"almost rebuilt the whole of [the palace]\\", and the architectural historians Cecil Hewett and Tim Tatton- Brown, in discussing bricks used in the tower known as \\"Bell Harry\\" at Canterbury Cathedral between 1494 and 1497, compared them to those found at Ford, where they wrote that Morton \\"built himself a palace.\\" Morton instigated a great deal of building-work during his clerical career, to the extent that he obtained a royal commission to press-gang stonemasons, bricklayers and other construction workers into his service. But Gough remarked that any building-work attributed to him at Ford would probably consist of brick. Ford Manor farmhouse includes brick- and stonework of varying dates, among them remains of the palace's gatehouse; a section of brick wall from the palace's garden also survives. Other parts of the palace complex considered to be Morton's work include a five-storey brick accommodation tower, of which nothing remains above ground, and a stable block: the site of the stables is now occupied by a barn, parts of which are of early Tudor date. =Archbishop Cranmer= Gough wrote that Archbishop Thomas Cranmer (1533 ‚Äì 1555) \\"seems to have been particularly attached to [Ford Palace], ... [involving it] inextricably with the progress of the English Reformation.\\" He was at the palace in 1535 when he wrote to King Henry VIII concerning the prior of Blackfriars, Canterbury, who had objected to his preaching against the Pope, and in 1536, when he wrote to Thomas Cromwell regarding a question of consanguinity. The year after, Cranmer left Lambeth Palace for Ford to escape an instance of plague, having concluded a meeting of bishops that had been deliberating on the text of the \\"Bishops' Book\\", which was to become the basis for the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion. In August the same year he was at Ford when he received copies of the Matthew Bible from the printer Richard Grafton, and he wrote from there to commend it to Thomas Cromwell. In 1538 he appointed Nicholas Ridley, with whom he became one of the Oxford Martyrs in 1555, to the neighbouring vicarage of Herne. In the summer of 1552 he was at Croydon Palace with Ridley, working on the Forty-Two Articles of Religion, but withdrew to Ford in October suffering from a fever. On 24 November, still at Ford, he dispatched a version of the Articles that he had reviewed and annotated to the Privy Council. Evidently Cranmer viewed Ford Palace as \\"a retreat from the unhealthy atmosphere of the London area, near enough to Canterbury without actually being in the city, where religion and politics sometimes formed a dangerous mixture\\"; and it was at the palace, in June 1544, that Cranmer received a visit from King Henry, who was on his way from London to France. The King stayed there overnight, before continuing to Dover. But, during the English Counter-Reformation under Queen Mary I, it was also at Ford Palace that Cranmer received orders to appear before the Privy Council, leading to his execution in 1556. =Decline and demolition= The first archbishop of Canterbury after the Elizabethan Religious Settlement of 1559, Matthew Parker (1559 ‚Äì1575), disliked Ford Palace to the extent that he wanted it partly demolished, and the residences at Bekesbourne and Canterbury to benefit from the spoils. Parker's plan was to retain sufficient buildings for the keeper of the park at Ford, which was part of the palace estate and extended to about , and only to maintain the manor as necessary for occasional visits by the archbishop. The estate was leased to the keeper as a farm, but, seeking Queen Elizabeth I's authority for a major change to the buildings, Parker wrote to the then Lord High Treasurer, William Cecil, in March 1573, describing Ford Palace as \\"an old, decayed, wasteful, unwholesome, and desolate house\\". The matter remained undecided when Parker died in May 1575. Part of the ruins of Ford Palace in 1775 Hasted and Hook believed that Archbishop John Whitgift (1583 ‚Äì 1604) hunted frequently in Ford Park, but Gough demurred, stating that the belief is not supported by any evidence. Archbishop George Abbot (1611 ‚Äì 1633), who accidentally shot and killed a park-keeper at Bramshill Park in 1621, was forced to withdraw from his archiepiscopal duties by King Charles I in 1627 and retired temporarily to Ford. Several instances are recorded when Abbot appointed individuals to the office of park-keeper at Ford between 1613 and 1624, and between 1631 and 1632 he spent ¬£11.15s.6d (¬£11.78) on repairs there, although he regarded it as a \\"moorish\\", or marshy, place. In 1647, during the English Civil War, Ford was surveyed on behalf of Parliament, which had acquired it from the Church of England, and found to be in reasonable repair. The whole estate was said to be worth a rent of ¬£43.10s. (¬£43.50), and the value of the materials of all the buildings was put at ¬£820, were they \\"to be sold ... and taken away\\". The palace was largely demolished by order of Parliament in 1658, while the see of Canterbury was vacant, and the materials were sold for ¬£840.; ; ; . The estate was returned to the see after the Restoration of 1660, and a report made in 1661 states that \\"Ford pallace is so much ruonated as if the author therein did count it merit to make such destruction; the mannor house [is] totaly cast down [and] the Chapell made a barne\\". In 1667 the original barn and the gatehouse were reported as dilapidated, and in 1668 it was reported that the tenant of the remainder of the estate, not including the barn and gatehouse, had continued the demolition and sold \\"six or seven loads of the best stone\\". At about the same time tiles were sold from Ford to the churchwardens of nearby Herne. Although the remains of the palace continued to be quarried for materials or adapted, parts of the palace hall and chapel stood until 1964, when they were demolished in preparation for a new farm building. Archaeology Detail of a 17th-century manuscript map with a pictorial representation of Ford Palace: north is at the top. Viewed from the west, this oast house straddles the site of Ford Palace. Roman coins were found during its construction. While incidental finds on the site of Ford Palace include part of a Roman inscription and Roman coins, very little active archaeology has been undertaken there. In 2011 four circular holes in diameter were drilled in connection with proposed construction work slightly to the east of the palace site, but nothing of archaeological interest was found. At about the same time, further exploration at the eastern end of the site uncovered \\"two substantial brick and mortar walls of unknown date\\". Several structures that probably formed part of the palace remain above ground. Parts of Ford Manor farmhouse, which stands on the site of the palace gatehouse and is adjacent to the public road, date to the 15th and 17th centuries. A barn to the north-east of the farmhouse incorporates much of a Tudor stable block that was originally about long; the structure of its roof features crown posts and tie beams.

She and her husband Robert Reid Kalley are credited with founding one of the first Congregational (and Protestant) churches in Brazil. This would in time become the Union of Congregational Churches in Brazil. Life Sarah Poulton Wilson was born in Nottingham in 1825 to parents who were religious Nonconformist and political Reformists. Politician Henry Wilson was her half-brother.Wilson Papers, Sheffield University, Retrieved 31 October 2015 Her father had homes in Nottingham and Torquay. Sarah was well travelled and educated and she had talents for water colour painting and languages. She led a group studying the Bible at Abbey Road Congregational chapel in the British seaside town of Torquay where she was caring for her brother. Robert Reid Kalley and his first wife Margaret Crawford had been doing missionary work among the poor on the Portuguese island of Madeira when they, along with their supporters, were arrested and expelled by anti-Protestants, taking temporary refuge on the island of Trinidad. The Kalleys spent two years seeking Christian converts among the followers of Islam, Judaism and Nestorianism in Malta, Egypt and Palestine, where it is believed Sarah became acquainted with Kalley. Following the death of Margaret, Kalley wed Sarah in Torquay in 1852. The First Presbyterian Portuguese Church in Springfield Meanwhile, the Protestants who had been driven out of Madeira to work in Trinidad realised that they needed a better home. 150 moved to New York with funding from the American Protestant Society. The Maderira refugees were eventually invited by the people of Springfield to make their home in Illinois. On 13 November 1849 they were met with charity and an area of the town became known as Madeira. By 1853 there were about 1,000 Portuguese in Springfield.When Springfield took in Portuguese refugees, Erika Holst, 24 September 2015, Illinois Times, Retrieved 6 November 2015 The Kalleys went to America and they served in the Springfield Portuguese Presbyterian Church 1853‚Äì1854 in Springfield, Illinois, where Sarah oversaw the Congregational music. After a brief sojourn in England during the first months of 1855, the couple set out for Petr√≥polis, Brazil in April where they were welcomed into the Catholic country by their neighbor Brazilian emperor Pedro II. The emperor's liberal views were one of the reasons that they chose Brazil for their mission. The country also provided a welcoming religious climate that allowed Kalley's Portuguese-speaking followers from Madeira to join them. The founding of the first Protestant church in Brazil began in the Kalley's home where the hired help joined the Kalleys in evening worship. In August, Sarah organized a Sunday school class, followed less than a month later by Dr. Kalley organizing an adult Bible study. By 1856 they established a Portuguese evangelical church, which was formally organized on July 11, 1858 as . This would in time become the basis for the Union of Congregational Churches in Brazil. Sarah advocated the power of faith through song, and the couple created a hymnal in the Portuguese language. The book contained original revivalist hymnsSarah Poulton Lalley, Hymnary.org as well as translations of hymns and psalms. ', co-authored by the Kalleys in 1861, was the first Protestant hymnal published in Brazil and became an inter-denominational hymnal, which is still in use today. The 1959 edition of the hymnal credits Sarah with authorship of 72 of the songs. The songs had been checked by a native Portuguese speaker after they were written, but some words like \\"white as snow\\" can still reflect the author's background. Sarah authored The Life of John Bunyan, and was the co-Portuguese language translator of his novel The Holy War. Sarah also started a women's group at their church.

It argues that free will is an illusion, but that this does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of political and social freedom, and that it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life. Summary Harris says the idea of free will \\"cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality\\" and is incoherent. According to Harris, science \\"reveals you to be a biochemical puppet.\\"Nahmias, Eddy (August 13, 2012). \\"Does Contemporary Neuroscience Support or Challenge the Reality of Free Will?\\" Big Questions Online. People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, \\"emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control.\\" Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Even without free will, consciousness has an important role to play in the choices we make. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life. Reception The book has been the subject of criticism. For example, in a critical review, philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett argued that Free Will attacks only the \\"popular\\" idea of free will, which Dennett accepts to be flawed. He states that \\"improvements\\" to the popular idea of free will exist and that Harris should have instead addressed these. Harris published a response. Commenting on both Dennett's review and Harris' reply, author Richard Carrier criticised Harris' response, saying Dennett \\"extensively cites experts and published work in the subject\\" while Harris did not, further claiming Harris held the field of philosophy in \\"contempt\\". By contrast, philosopher Paul Pardi offered a more positive review, calling the book \\"intriguing and accessible. It‚Äôs a good primer on key ideas in physicalist theories of freedom and the will, written for a broad audience. Many of the ideas are challenging and he does a good job of articulating what is as stake. I think the way he frames his core argument is a bit too breezy, though he could tighten it up fairly easily by adopting some of Strawson‚Äôs framework.\\" See also *Immanuel Kant *Neuroscience of free will References Category:2012 non-fiction books Category:Books by Sam Harris Category:American non-fiction books Category:Free will Category:Determinism Category:English-language books ","title":"Free Will (book)"},{"id":"48424190","text":"Sergei Korolev was a Soviet rocket engineer.

He played college football at the University of Tennessee. Early years Warren attended Wayne County High School where he was considered the state's best punter. Additionally, he was the team's placekicker. He practiced baseball and was drafted out of high school by the Cincinnati Reds. College careers After receiving Division I NCAA scholarships offers from different schools, he settled on the University of Tennessee. His best season came as a freshman, registering 52 punts for 2,106 yards and a 40.5-yard average. In his last two years he was a backup behind Jimmy Colquitt, with Warren handling the directional punts. He finished his college career posting 42 games, 133 punts, 5,289 yards and a 39.8-yard average. He also practiced baseball. Professional career Warren was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1983 NFL Draft. In the 70's and early 80's, the Cowboys had the luxury that they didn't need to carry a punter on their roster, because quarterback Danny White could perform that task at a high level. After he was injured in the 1982 NFC championship and placekicker Rafael Septi√©n was forced to be the punter replacement, the team decided to carry Warren as the punter for the 1983 season. As a rookie, he shared punting duties with White, until being placed on the injured reserve list after suffering a right knee injury while covering one of his punts against the Los Angeles Raiders. In 1984, he became part of a revolving door, where he was released and signed on different times during the season. On August 19, 1985, he was waived after being passed on the depth chart by Mike Saxon.

In his later career he established the technical foundation of British commercial airline industry and promoted human powered flight.  Early life  Beverley Strahan Shenstone was born on 10 June 1906 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was the eldest child of Saxon T. Shenstone and Kitty Alison n√©e Paterson, and the nephew of Allen Shenstone. His father died on Christmas Day 1915, leaving Beverley and his two younger brothers to be raised by Kitty and their paternal grandfather, Joseph Newton Shenstone. Beverley was taught by his uncles to sail. He designed, built and raced model yachts. As an undergraduate in 1927 he undertook a canoeing expedition throughout the waterways of South and South West England. At the end of this tour, he worked for few weeks in an Air Ministry laboratory located in the basement of the London Science Museum. He graduated from the University of Toronto in 1928 with a degree in Engineering, which was followed by master's degree research into flying boat stability supervised by Professor John H. Parkin. In June 1929 he learned to fly under an RCAF cadetship, going solo in under 10 hours which earned him a permanent RCAF commission. In an era when most aircraft were fabric-covered wooden biplanes, Shenstone realised that metal monoplanes were the future and that German industry was leading that field. He applied for a job with Dornier in Friedrichshafen but was unsuccessful. Perseverance and useful contacts paid off, with the assistance of Parkin and Captain M.C. Christie (the British Air Attache in Berlin) he got a position with Junkers in November 1929 at Dessau.  Early career  He worked for a year at Junkers learning metal-working techniques such as panel beating and riveting. He worked in technical departments such as the engine workshop. He also studied the all-wing theories of Hugo Junkers. Shenstone worked with Yoshihara Seiji on preparing the latter's Junkers Junior for its flight from Dessau to Tokyo in August 1930. Glider launch at Wasserkuppe, August 1930, where Shenstone learnt to glide In the summer of 1930, Shenstone learnt to glide at the Wasserkuppe. This was the premier gliding centre in Europe at the time. There he met Geoffrey Hill and Alexander Lippisch both pioneers of all-wing aircraft. At this time Lippish was leading the technical branch of the Rh√∂n- Rossitten Gesellschaft. Shenstone spent the winter of 1930/1931 working with Lippish and his team developing tail-less gliders (and learning to ski). His friendship with Lippisch lasted for 40 years. While in Germany, Shenstone travelled to Heidelberg and met Ludwig Prandtl who was a pioneer in the application of systematic mathematical analyses to aerodynamics. It was also at the Wasserkuppe that he met Air Commodore John Adrian Chamier and acted as his translator. Chamier suggested that Shenstone should come to work for the British at Vickers-Armstrongs of which Chamier was a director. To find work, he moved to England in May 1931. Geoffrey Hill tried to get him a job at Westland but there was nothing suitable. He was interviewed by Sidney Camm but due to a misunderstanding walked out of the interview. Through Chamier he got an interview in 1932 with Reginald Mitchell at Supermarine (which was part of Vickers-Armstrong). While disappointed with Shenstone's knowledge of monoplane-wing construction, Mitchell was impressed by his expertise in aerodynamic theory and gave him a full-time position at ¬£500 per annum following a two-month trial. Spitfire As well as providing technical support, Mitchell charged Shenstone with bringing an external perspective to Supermarine's designs. As a result, Shenstone travelled with Ernest Hives of Rolls-Royce to Germany in early 1934 and later that year to the US with where he visited NACA and a number of aircraft manufacturers. As a result, he reported back to Mitchell on the latest NACA wing profiles and the importance being placed on a high level of aerodynamic finish by other designers.Pegram. Pages 158 - 159. Even before his Type 224 design was rejected by the Air Ministry Mitchell had decided to commence a thorough reworking of the design, in particular the wing design. Assisted by Shenstone's expertise in theoretical aerodynamics Mitchell with additional input from Ernest Mansbridge, Joe Smith and Alfred Faddy began to investigate using an elliptical wing.Ackroyd. The Aerodynamics of the Spitfire. Page 61. Both Mitchell and Stenstone were aware of the potential of an elliptical wing as Mitchell had proposed it for his Type 179 flying boat, while the Short Crusader seaplane which had been an entry for the 1927 Schneider Trophy had one.McKinstry. Page 49. Meanwhile, Shenstone was aware that Frederick Lanchester had suggested in 1907 that it was better to spread the vortex flow along the wing instead of concentrating it at the tip.Beaver. Page 39 while Max Munk had also identified that when a wing has an elliptically distributed lift then induced drag will be reduced. Continued iteration led the Supermarine designers to create a distorted elliptical wing with the wing tip pushed forward to produce more lift. With its main spar at right angles the result was a rigid stable wing that provided the stability needed for an aircraft with wing mounted guns. The new wing design was incorporated in the Type 300 proposal that eventually became the Spitfire.  Later projects at Supermarine Spitfire elliptical wing at Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum After his work on the Spitfire, Shenstone was chief aerodynamicist on the Supermarine B.12/36 proposal. This specification was for a four-engined heavy bomber, and the Supermarine proposal used a wing with a highly swept leading edge, storing the bomb load in both the wing and fuselage. While Supermarine were given a development contract for two prototypes, after the first was destroyed in a bombing raid in September 1940 this specification was fulfilled by the Short Stirling which had been the Air Ministry's backup due to their doubts about Supermarine.Robertson 1987, p. 99Buttler, 2004, Fighters & Bombers, 1935‚Äì1950.. Hinckley, Kent, UK: Midlands Publishing. ., p. 99 Air Ministry In 1938 Shenstone left Supermarine and went to work for the Air Ministry as a senior scientific officer for the director of civil aviation. There he had a role encouraging cooperation and efficiency within the industry. In October 1940 he was sent to the US as part of the British Air Commission working to ensure that American lend-lease aircraft were matched to the requirements of the RAF. In this role he was to take an interest in the development of the P-51 Mustang. Despite his early research, in 1943, after a difficult experience crossing the Atlantic in a flying boat, Shenstone became convinced that they would be outmoded in post war aviation. This was not a popular position for a member of the Brabazon Committee and drew criticism from other members. Return to Canada Shenstone moved back to Canada in 1946 where he was technical administrator for Trans-Canada Airlines . He then moved to Avro Canada in Toronto, where he was involved in technical management aspects of the new Avro Jetliner and CF-100 jet fighter, but was disappointed by the lack of development work that would fully utilise his experience. This prompted him to write to N.E Rowe (who was now director of research and development with BEA) to enquire about the possible positions. As a result, he was given the post of chief engineer in 1948. At BEA he instigated a system of statistical maintenance control, using past component failures to direct future maintenance. More significantly, he made important contributions to the specifications of British civil aircraft. For instance, he was instrumental in increasing the passenger capacity of the Vickers Viscount. In the late 1950s he was key in developing the tail engine configuration of the de Havilland D.H.121 (later to become the Trident) and the VC10. Shenstone also introduced BEA's first jet services, starting with the de Havilland Comet in 1960. In that year he was also appointed to the board of directors of BEA. He was president of the RAeS from May 1962 to May 1963. Later career In the autumn of 1964 he was appointed technical director of BOAC where he was responsible for co-ordinating the work of BOAC's engineering and flight operations. In this capacity he was principally concerned with long-term projects, particularly supersonic airliners. He had been involved with the development of supersonic passenger aircraft from the beginning. A Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee had been formed in 1956 to make recommendations, and he had represented BEA on the technical sub-committee. Later, speaking at a RAeS discussion on \\"The Difficulties and Advantages of Supersonic Civil Transport\\" in March 1965, he expressed his scepticism of the profitability of supersonic transport (SST). He described it as \\"the largest, most expensive and most dubious project ever undertaken in the development of civil aircraft\\" stating that, \\"the greatest doubt lies in the improbability that the SST will be able to be profitable.\\" He maintained an interest in gliding. He worked with Waclaw Czerwi≈Ñski in the late 1940s to design the Czerwi≈Ñski-Shenstone Loudon and Harbinger and was a founder member of Project Sigma; an attempt to develop a high-performance sailplane aimed at winning the open class of the 1969 World Gliding Championships. In 1955 Shenstone published articles that concluded that man powered flight was possible but fundamental data was lacking. He suggested that if resources were put into the field, a successful machine would be possible. He presented a paper \\"The problem of the very light weight highly-efficient aeroplane\\" in the conference of the Low Speed Aerodynamics Research Association . In January 1957 Shenstone, and six other enthusiasts (including Terence Nonweiler) met in Cranfield in and formed the Man-Powered Aircraft Committee (later to become the Man-Powered Aircraft Group of the RAeS) with the purposes of reviewing relevant literature, assessing its prospects, and promoting its realisation. He retired at the end of 1966 and moved to Cyprus where he had the part-time role as technical advisor for Cyprus Airways. He remained in Cyprus until his death in November 1979.

It is a Grade I listed building. The church is cruciform in plan and dates from the 12th, 13th and 14th century with additions and restoration in 1872. It is constructed from sandstone rubble with sandstone dressings and some tufa with sandstone slate and tile roofs. The earliest surviving masonry is a section of the north wall of the nave, which can be dated to the early Norman period; possibly as early as the late eleventh century. The church sits on top of a steep slope above a giant redwood tree to the north, planted in memory of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. It is one of the Pyon Group of parishes west of Leominster. The parish also includes the small hamlet of Ledgemoor, between Kings Pyon and Weobley, which has its own stone built mission chapel, and a village hall. Although King's Pyon used to have its own village hall it was demolished almost 60 years ago, and thus the church itself is now the focus of community activities. History and description The church dates from the 12th century. The inside of the roof of the nave and south transept date from the 14th century and have a magnificent two tiered structure of black trefoiled headed wind-braces to each slope, in contrast to the whitewashed ceiling. The square tower dates from the 14th century, in which hang five bells from the early 17th century, and are rung frequently by enthusiastic campanologists. The tower incorporates a three faced clock, which chimes the hour, and was installed in 1872. The church is a Grade I listed building. Inside the church is an elaborately decorated tomb recess, probably 13th or 14th century, with a chest tomb beneath carrying the alabaster effigy of a man in armour at whose feet lies a stylised lion. His limbs have been amputated, probably when much of the interior decoration of the Church was destroyed by Scottish mercenary troops of the Parliamentarians during the siege of Hereford in 1645. Also to be found in the South Transept are two memorial windows installed by the King family about a 100 years ago. There is an carved Victorian altar screen at the east end of the church, and another in the west end behind the Victorian font, all in memory of former family members of the congregation as well as numerous memorial plaques and windows which trace the history of the principal families and benefactors of the church over the years. A carved panelled pulpit and a readers lectern sit either side of the chancel. The Victorian addition of the north transept has recently been refurbished to serve as a community area. The original Norman font of the church is displayed under the memorial window. The recent restoration project of the church was finished at the end of 2017 and also addressed the needs of the last Quinquennial Report. The project was principally funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, and also included the repointing of the external walls of the chancel and north and south transepts of the church, the relining of the organ roof above the vestry, renewal of the guttering, and the restoration of the mullioned window in the south transept. The most recent project followed two previous restoration projects, over the last 10 years or so, to restore the tower, and to repair the nave and roof of the church.

In 1895, he created the title role in Mascagni's Guglielmo Ratcliff. Life and career De Negri was born in Alessandria, a city in Italy's Piedmont Region. In 1873 he began studying singing, first in his native city with Carlo Guasco and then in Milan with Luigia Abbadia. He made his debut on 26 December 1876 at the Teatro Sociale in Bergamo in Filippo Sangiorgi's opera Diana di Chaverny and the following month appeared there to great success in the title role of Donizetti's Poliuto.. In 1878 De Negri was contracted by the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb where he sang numerous leading roles in operas by Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, and Meyerbeer, as well as appearing in the world premiere of Ivan Zajc's Lizinka. While appearing in Zagreb met his future wife Baroness Fanny Scotti, a pianist. They married three years later in Vienna and had one daughter Margot who later became an opera singer. Up until 1882, De Negri sang primarily in Zagreb, Trieste and Budapest. De Negri's wife Fanny Scotti 1885 On his return to Italy, he was increasingly in demand in the major opera houses appearing in leading tenor roles at the Teatro San Carlo in La traviata and Lucrezia Borgia; at La Fenice in Le proph√®te, La Gioconda; at the Teatro Regio di Torino in Il duca d'Alba and La Juive; and at La Scala in Simon Boccanegra. He returned to the Teatro Regio in the 1887‚Äì88 season where he scored a considerable triumph in Verdi's Otello. It was to become one of his signature roles. At the time he was considered Tamagno's chief rival in the role and his portrayal was particularly praised by Verdi. According to Rodolfo Celletti, De Negri may have lacked the ringing tone found in Tamagno's high notes but was superior to him in his diction, phrasing, and acting skills. Between 1888 and 1894 he sang the role throughout Italy and abroad. He sang it at La Scala in the 1891‚Äì92 season and also made his role debut in Tannh√§user during the same season there. In 1895, he returned to La Scala to sing the title role of Mascagni's Guglielmo Ratcliff in its world premiere.Celletti, Rodolfo (1989). Voce di tenore, pp. 169-70. IdeaLibri. By 1896, the assumption of multiple taxing dramatic tenor roles and a frenetic performance schedule took a toll on De Negri's voice. He underwent a series of throat operations in 1897 which had little success, and he retired from the stage the following year. His final performances were in the title roles of Tannh√§user and Samson et Dalila at the Teatro Verdi in Trieste after which he taught singing in Turin. With the arrival of the phonograph he came out of retirement briefly to record arias from Otello and Norma for Zonophone in 1902.

The recognition and celebrations of Kekri were stronger when Finland was still an agricultural society, and prior to the modern Christmas culture and traditions being embedded in the Finnish society. Historically, Kekri has also referred to a god. Originally, the celebration of Kekri was not tied to a permanent calendar date, but ‚Äì instead ‚Äì was determined by the ongoing year's agricultural autumn activities. However, by the early 1800s its date stabilized at the All Saints' Day, i.e. in the beginning of November. Etymology In various Finnish dialects and in vernacular language, the term kekri and its cognates have been used to refer to the last thing left, residue, remnant and/or end of something, most commonly ‚Äì and possibly originally ‚Äì the harvest season. Historically, Kekri was a god that protected cattle. The term has also been used in reference to leprechaun/fairy, scare and scarecrow. In his listing of Finnish gods in 1551, the Finnish author Mikael Agricola defined Kekri as a god that enhances the growth of livestock: \\"K√§kri se liseis Carjan casvon\\". In his study 'Mythologica fennica' in 1789, Cristfried Ganander stated the same about Kekri, and added that the term Kekri also refers to the celebration of the end of the harvest season.Otavan Suuri Ensyklopedia, Part 4, Juusten-Kreikka, p. 2854, Otava, 1978, . The remembrance of the dead is a similarity between the traditional celebrations of Kekri and Halloween. In the Finnic tradition of the past, each family invited their dead to their Kekri feasts, making a part of Kekri formal and serious. The second day of Kekri ‚Äì however ‚Äì has traditionally been more relaxed, similar in this respect to Boxing Day in the widespread modern Western Christmas tradition. In the second day of Kekri, especially in the old times, people have visited family and friends, dressed up as various types of Kekri characters. These Kekri characters of the past are commonly viewed as predecessors of the modern-day Santa Claus. Traditionally, the end of the harvest season in Kekri has been celebrated with abundant feasts, which often have included lamb roast as one of the courses served. Various kinds of magic, spells, beliefs and myths too have also been an important part of old Kekri traditions, as well as bonfires, especially in certain parts of Finland. Kekri today Kekri traditions began to disappear in Finland with the industrialization and urbanization of the Finnish society. Many customs and traditions associated with Kekri have since been transferred to the modern Christmas and New Year celebrations. Some ancient Kekri traditions have remained the longest in Eastern Finland. Today, Kekri is celebrated annually in the Eastern Finnish city of Kajaani by the burning of the so-called Kekri goat (Finnish: Kekripukki), built in the recent times normally by local actors and other players. The incineration of the Kekri goat is usually linked to other program and activities, such as dance and musical performances, street market, feast, etc. Kekri is celebrated also in other parts of Finland, for instance in the Southern Finnish island of Suomenlinna, where various events are prepared annually in honor of Kekri. The celebrations typically have included abundant feasts, with lamb roast traditionally being part of the menu. Although the Celtic-originated Halloween has gradually begun to penetrate into the Finnish autumn feast traditions from the United States, Kekri has held its ground. In part due to the celebrations of Halloween having become increasingly commercial, many Finns prefer not to have it associated with Kekri or the All Saints' Day (Finnish: Pyh√§inp√§iv√§).

He played basketball at the collegiate level with Quinnipiac for four seasons and earned all-conference recognition on three occasions. Azotam attended the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics & Science and Marianapolis Preparatory School for high school and was named New England All-Star in his final two seasons. He is mainly a power forward.  Early life  Ike was born on January 14, 1991 in Boston, Massachusetts as the youngest of four children of Ada and Bennet Azotam. He has two brothers, Dozie and Uchenna, and a sister, Adaorah. Azotam's parents both moved from Nigeria to the United States at about 20 years old for a better life. Dozie played American football for the Georgetown Hoyas and is a member of the school's African-American Advisory Board (AAAB). Unchenna and Adaorah attended Georgetown as well, leading Ike to consider joining the same school. The family lived on the south end of Roxbury, a neighborhood in Boston, on 1350 Tremont St. Their house was located very close to the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center. Ike began playing basketball in fifth grade, but began taking it more seriously once he went through a growth spurt heading into ninth grade. Growing up, he often walked from his home to a nearby YMCA facility to practice. Azotam supposedly made his first slam dunk his first at the age of 15, a moment that he would remember for the rest of his life. Despite repeatedly performed the same move, but failed to do so when he called his friends to watch him. However, in the summer, he grew four inches and was eventually able to consistently dunk the ball. Azotam also liked to play with Dozie, who was seven years older and playing college football at around the same time. His mother said, \\"You would have to ask him to take out the trash, clean the dishes and clean his room, but you never had to ask him to play basketball.\\"  High school career  Azotam attended the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics & Science (pictured) for three years. Azotam first played high school basketball with John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics & Science in the neighborhood of Roxbury in Boston. He came in as a freshman with very little experience in organized basketball and O'Bryant head coach Juan Figueroa praised him for his athleticism but considered him very raw, primarily on the defensive end. However, he rapidly improved within the next three years. On March 2, 2007, as a sophomore, Azotam recorded 18 points and 9 rebounds. He had two offensive rebounds in the final two minutes of the game, but North Attleborough High School pulled off the upset win. By the end of his sophomore season, he was averaging 16.5 points and 9.5 rebounds per game. In his junior season, on January 12, 2009, Azotam was one of seven Players of the Week in boys' basketball named by Boston.com after scoring a total of 40 points and 34 rebounds in wins over Boston English and West Roxbury High School. Later that year, on February 21, John O'Bryant was defeated by Madison Park Technical Vocational High School at the Boston City League championship game despite having Azotam put up a double-double of 16 points and 20 rebounds. Following his third season at O'Bryant, after which they finished 18‚Äì6, Azotam earned New England All-Star and Massachusetts All-Scholastic recognition. He decided to attend Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut as a senior to help secure an NCAA Division I scholarship in the near future. By the end of his season with Marianapolis Prep, he was averaging 19.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, 5.2 assists, and 2.1 blocks, leading the team to second place at the NEPSAC championship. The Golden Knights finished with a record of 21‚Äì9. College career Azotam played collegiately for the Quinnipiac Bobcats from 2010 to 2014. He was twice named to the Second-team All‚ÄìNEC in 2012 and 2013. Azotam was a First-team All‚ÄìMAAC selection in his senior year in 2014.  Professional career  In September 2014, Azotam signed his first professional contract with Mar√≠n Peixegalego of the LEB Plata, the second-best basketball league in Spain behind the ACB. The team was coming off a 9‚Äì15 season, in which they failed to qualify for the playoffs. He made his debut on October 5 against Azpeitia, scoring 22 points and adding 7 rebounds and 2 steals. In his next game, on October 11, Azotam recorded his first double-double, with 19 points and 13 rebounds vs Canarias Basketball Academy. He followed up by notching a season-high 24 points on Xuventude Baloncesto. Azotam had another notable performance on November 30, when he scored 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds against FC Barcelona B√†squet B. Azotam led Mar√≠n in points, rebounds, field goal percentage and minutes through February 17, 2015, when he was named LEB Plata Player of the Week. By the end of the season, he was averaging 13.9 points and 6.6 rebounds and making over 55% of his shots. On October 29, 2015, Azotam inked with the Island Storm of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL). He claimed that he wanted to play with the team because the Storm were historically successful in the NBL Canada. Head coach Joe Salerno said, \\"Ike is a tough, hard nose, physical player, who has a great mid-range game and isn't scared to mix it up a bit in the paint.\\" Salerno also believed that Azotam would have an even more successful second season in professional basketball. Azotam returned to Spain in December 2015, after signing with Leyma B√°squet Coru√±a of the LEB Oro.  Personal  Throughout his childhood, Ike was closest to his eldest brother Dozie. Dozie, ironically, can‚Äôt hit a free throw and has no bounce, but he provided great emotional support. Apart from playing basketball with him, the younger Azotam would ride to the airport with his father whenever Dozie, who attended Georgetown University, would return to his family's Boston home. Upon his return, he would go to the local YMCA with Ike. He did this to the extent that it became a tradition. Dozie said, \\"It just became a habit...Family comes first.\\" Unfortunately, Ike couldn‚Äôt learn much from his brother, Dozie, due to his overall lack of basketball knowledge. He instead turned to Steve Ekechuku to fine tune his game. Mr. Ekechuku earned his stripes on the Akron blacktop crossing up anyone who dared challenge him. They called him simply ‚ÄúThat Guy.‚Äù Steve was happy to pick up the slack left by Dozie and impart much of his wisdom on his young understudy. Steve always told Ike, ‚Äúif you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything!‚Äù None of Ike's siblings stand above 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and his mother is even shorter. However, his uncles and cousins are far taller, ranging from 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) to 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m). Ike himself has a height of 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m) and stood 6 ft 6 (1.98 m) as a high school senior.

Allen, uncle to President Grover Cleveland. The club took its name from the eagles and hawks which nested in the surrounding trees. Allen had subdivided the property he owned on Grand Island and built the Club. At the time, it was called the \\"Allen Mansion,\\" but it emerged as a public resort. By June 1865, Falconwood was closed to the public as it had become the property of the \\"Falconwood House Company.\\" The group was called \\"The Falconwood Club\\" and two log houses. Falconwood continued to flourish as one of the most popular of the Grand Island clubs of the last quarter of the 19th century. Each member was allowed two weeks at the club every summer under the terms of the membership. For the most part, the week days were stag affairs. Families would spend their summer weekends at the club, with businessmen making the daily run to Buffalo and back on a launch, which would drop them in the center of the city at the foot of Main Street. Near the turn of the century, Falconwood became the property of George E. Matthews, of the Buffalo Courier- Express (who died in 1911). Under his ownership, the house continued to serve as a private club and estate for his family and friends until it was destroyed by fire in the twenties. Clubhouse 300x300pxThe Falconwood Club clubhouse was built in 1882 and designed by Joseph Lyman Silsbee, a prominent architect of the time who studied at the first school of architecture in the United States, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is purported that the original cost of building and outfitting Falconwood was $13,000 (). =Exterior= The Villa style (later known as Queen Anne) club was located on a 45-acre tract overlooking the West River. The main building, a two-story building clubhouse was 60 x 40 ft. It was built entirely of wood with steep gabled roofs and the exterior was painted gray, with the long slant of the roofs painted a bright red. The front, facing the river, was dominated by a large heavily ornamented central projection that appeared to be Moorish in detail. The clubhouse featured a 12-foot veranda that ran the full length of the building, providing a view of the well-kept lawn sloping down to a wharf which projected 110 ft. into the river. At its height, the property consisted of forty-five acres in grounds, laid out with ornamental trees and flowers. The property was dotted with many large old growth trees, with trunks four to five ft. thick. =Interior= On the ground floor, large double doors admitted guests to a broad vestibule and hall with an imposing staircase that could be seen leading to the second floor. All the rooms on the main floor were paneled in natural wood. The stained glass in the doors and the windows was in shades of amber, brown, red and gold, which accented the natural tones of the wood. To the right of the vestibule; a 32 x 40 ft. parlor; to the left, a 32 x 40 ft. dining room. Towards the end of the central hall were doors leading to the public bathrooms, kitchens, and pantries. On the second floor, off the stairwell, there was another large central hall that ran the full length of the house. Outfitted as a second floor sitting room, its large crescent shaped windows looked out on the riverfront on one side and back to the Falconwood Park and forestlands on the other. There were twin halls running parallel to the building's length that ended in French doors leading to the second story verandas. The 12 guest rooms (containing a bedroom and bath) were off these hallways. =Outer buildings= There was also an elegant bar, a bowling alley, an assembly hall, and numerous guest cottages. There was also a 24 x 20 ft. ballroom in a separate area about 40 ft. away from the hotel. Steam boat steamer built in 1860 The clubs had its own steam launch, as was typical of the resorts on Grand Island at the time. The Falconwood's steamer, built in 1860, was called \\"The Falcon\\" and featured a glass-enclosed cabin on the main deck and an awning-shaded promenade deck above.

She was among the leading two-year-old fillies of her generation in Europe in 2015 when she won three of her five races including the Moyglare Stud Stakes in Ireland and the Fillies' Mile in England. On her first appearance of 2016 the filly posted a decisive victory in the classic 1000 Guineas but was subsequently beaten when favourite for the Irish 1,000 Guineas. She went on to win a second classic in The Oaks in June, the first filly to complete the Guineas-Oaks double since Kazzia in 2002. She went on to take her fifth and sixth Group One races with wins in the Pretty Polly Stakes and the Nassau Stakes. She then defeated male opposition to take the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. At the end of the year she was named Cartier Horse of the Year and the world's best three-year-old filly. She won on her reappearance in 2017 but subsequently suffered an injury which led to her retirement later that year without racing again. Background Minding is a bay mare with a white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by Orpendale, Chelston & Wynatt, a breeding company associated with the Coolmore Stud. She was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland five times. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle and Ruler of the World. She was the second foal produced by Lillie Langtry, a top-class racemare who won the Coronation Stakes and the Matron Stakes in 2010. She was a fifth-generation descendant of Noble Lassie, the dam of Vaguely Noble. The filly was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of her ownership have changed from race to race: she has sometimes been listed as being the property of Derrick Smith, whilst on other occasions she has been described as being owned by a partnership of Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Minding began her racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Leopardstown Racecourse on 11 June 2015 in which she was ridden by Seamie Heffernan. Starting the 11/4 third choice in a seven-runner field, she led for most of the way before being overtaken inside the final furlong and finished second to the Dermot Weld- trained favourite Tanaza. Two weeks later at the same course, the filly was brought back in distance for a six furlong maiden and started 2/5 favourite against three opponents. Heffernan settled the filly in second place before taking the lead two furlong from the finish and Minding drew away to win \\"very easily\\" by five and a half lengths. Minding was stepped up in class for the Group Two Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 22 August. Ridden by Colm O'Donoghue she started at odds of 8/1, behind her stable companions Ballydoyle and Alice Springs, and the Grangecon Stud Stakes winner Most Beautiful. After settling behind the leaders, she made steady progress in the second half of the races to take second place, two lengths behind Ballydoyle. On 13 September, over the same course and distance, Minding and Ballydoyle met again in the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes. Ballydoyle started favourite ahead of Tanaza and the British challenger Blue Bayou (Sweet Solera Stakes) with Minding fourth in the betting on 15/2. The other five runners included Now or Never (runner-up in the Futurity Stakes), Great Page (Prix du Calvados) and Alice Springs. Ridden by Heffernan, Minding tracked the leaders as Ballydoyle made the running before moving into second place in the last quarter mile. She overtook Ballydoyle 100 yards from the finish and won by three quarters of a length with Alice Springs half a length away in third. Aidan O'Brien, having trained the first three home said \\"We knew Minding would handle [the soft ground] as her dam handled it well... we thought she had improved and she did. She got the trip well. I'm delighted with all three fillies. Seamie gave her a lovely, patient ride\\". On 9 October, Minding was sent to England and moved up in distance for the Group One Fillies' Mile at Newmarket Racecourse in which she was ridden by Ryan Moore. She was made 5/4 favourite in a ten-runner field with her main opposition appearing to come from the John Gosden-trained Nathra (unbeaten in two races) and the C. L. Weld Park Stakes winner Coolmore. The other fancied runners were Hawksmoor (Prestige Stakes) and the Luca Cumani-trained maiden winner Beautiful Morning. Moore settled the filly just behind the leaders as Hawksmoor set the pace before moving forward in the last quarter mile. Minding overtook Hawksmoor approaching the final furlong and drew away to win easily by four and a half lengths from Nathra, with Hawksmoor two and a quarter lengths back in third. Moore commented \\"She's a truly exceptional filly. She travelled well all the way through. As soon as I pulled her out the race was over in seconds\\". =2016: three-year-old season= Spring Minding made her three-year- old debut in the 203rd running of the 1000 Guineas on 1 May over Newmarket's Rowley Mile in which she was ridden by Moore and started the 11/10 favourite. Her fifteen opponents included Lumiere, Ballydoyle, Nathra, Alice Springs, Illuminate (Albany Stakes, Duchess of Cambridge Stakes), Jet Setting (Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial) and Midweek (runner-up in the Prix Imprudence). Minding started quickly and settled behind the leaders before going to the front approaching the last quarter mile. She quickly went clear of the field and stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by three and a half lengths from Ballydoyle. Alice Springs took third place ahead of the 40/1 outsider Fireglow to complete a 1-2-3 for the O'Brien stable. After the race Moore said \\"She's out on her own, really. She's just faster than them and stays better than them. We were going very comfortably and had them all in trouble at halfway.\\" O'Brien, who was winning his 250th Group One race did not rule out the possibility of running Minding against colts in The Derby but indicated that the Irish 1,000 Guineas and The Oaks were more likely targets. Three weeks later Minding started 4/11 favourite against nine opponents in the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh. She raced in third place before staying on in the closing stages but failed to overhaul the leader Jet Setting and finished second, beaten a head, with a gap of ten lengths back to Now or Never in third. Summer On 3 June Minding was stepped up in distance for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse and started the 11/10 favourite. Her eight opponents included Skiffle (Height of Fashion Stakes), Turret Rocks, Somehow (Cheshire Oaks) and Seventh Heaven (Fillies' Trial Stakes). Ridden by Moore she began to make progress from the rear of the field as the field rounded Tattenham Corner but was hampered and dropped back entering the straight. Moore was forced to switch left, then right to obtain a run, but once Minding was free of obstructions she showed good acceleration and overtook the leader Architecture a furlong from the finish. She increased her lead in the closing stages to win by 1 3/4 lengths from Architecture, with eight lengths back to Harlequeen in third. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"She has speed, class, stamina, a great mind ‚Äì everything. Ryan did brilliant to win on her after what she went through. Real heart, courage and guts had to come into it... She puts her heart into it so we‚Äôll give her an easy time now, I‚Äôd have thought, and then pick a target\\". Only four fillies appeared to oppose Minding when she was matched against older horses for the first time in the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 26 June. Ridden by Moore, she went off the 1/5 favourite ahead of Koora (St Simon Stakes) and Lucida (Rockfel Stakes), Speedy Boarding (Prix Corrida) and Bocca Baciata (Dance Design Stakes). Bocca Baciata set the pace and was more than six lengths clear of her rivals entering the straight, but Minding took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by four and a half lengths with a gap of five lengths back to Lucida in third. Minding was then sent back to England for the Group One Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 30 July and started the 1/5 favourite against four opponents. She met some trouble in running and was not particularly impressive in prevailing by one and a quarter lengths from Queen's Trust, a filly whose best previous effort had been a fourth place in the Ribblesdale Stakes. Ryan Moore commented \\"It was always going to be a messy sort of race. I just tried to keep it as simple as I could. She was only doing what she had to do\\". Autumn On 10 September Minding was matched against male opposition for the first time in the Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown. She started 9/4 second favourite behind Harzand in a twelve-runner field which also included Found, Almanzor, New Bay, Highland Reel and Hawkbill. After racing in mid- division she stayed on in the straight without looking likely to win and finished third behind Almanzor and Found. Minding was brought back in distance on 15 October to contest the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. Ridden by Moore she started the 7/2 favourite in a thirteen-runner field which included Galileo Gold, Awtaad, Ribchester (Prix Jacques Le Marois), Hit It A Bomb (Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf), Lightning Spear (Celebration Mile) and Jet Setting. Racing down the centre of the course, Minding tracked the leaders before taking the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish. She opened up a clear advantage over her opponents before holding off the late challenges of Ribchester and Lightning Spear to win by half a length and a length. =2017: four-year-old season= Minding began her third season in the Group 2 Mooresbridge Stakes over ten furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 1 May. She started the 1/3 favourite against three male opponents and won \\"easily\\" by three and a half lengths from Moonlight Magic after taking the lead soon after the start. Shortly after the race she sustained a pastern injury and in July it was announced that she had been retired from racing. O'Brien commented \\"we felt it would be a bit of a struggle to get her back for the remainder of the season so the lads decided that the best option was to retire her as she was too important... She had the most brilliant physique and a wonderful pedigree. Above all, it was her mind that made her special because she was such a pleasure to deal with and had a brilliant attitude. She was incredibly well-named\\". Assessment and honours On 10 November 2015, Minding was named Cartier Champion Two-year-old Filly at the 25th edition of the Cartier Racing Awards. In January 2016 Minding was officially rated the best two-year-old filly in Europe and the third best juvenile behind the colts Air Force Blue and Shalaa. On 8 November 2016 Minding won her second and third Cartier Awards as she was named Champion three-year-old filly and Horse of the Year. In December she was named Irish Horse of the Year at the Horse Racing Ireland Awards. In the 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Minding was given a rating of 122, making her the 18th best racehorse in the world and the top-rated three-year-old filly (level with Songbird).

Life =Until 1933= Heinrich Gr√ºber was born on 24 June 1891 in Stolberg in the Prussian Rhine Province (today part of North Rhine-Westphalia).Cf. Prussian Privy State Archives (GStA PK), VI. HA, Nl Gr√ºber, H. Einleitung (introduction), retrieved on 5 November 2015. His parents were the teacher Ernst Gr√ºber and Alwine Gr√ºber, n√©e Cleven from Gulpen, living in the Protestant diaspora among an else prevailingly Catholic population. After graduating in 1910 from the gymnasium in Eschweiler, Gr√ºber studied philosophy, history and theology at the Rhenish Frederick William University in Bonn and the Frederick William University of Berlin between 1910 and 1913. In Berlin he decided to become a pastor. In 1913 and 1914 Gr√ºber held a scholarship of the Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht, interrupted by his first state examination in theology in early 1914 and a first religious appointment in as vicar of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, a Protestant church combining congregations of Lutheran, Reformed and United Protestant alignment. In 1915 Gr√ºber was conscripted as a soldier and fought in World War I until 1918. In early 1918 he started an education as a military chaplain and in mid-1918 he passed the second state examination in theology and was accepted into the preacher seminary (Domkandidatenstift) at Berlin's Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church. He was tutored by court preacher Bruno Doehring. In 1920 he was ordained as pastor in Berlin and took his first ministry in , Dortmund. In June 1923 the French occupation forces prompted Gr√ºber's expulsion from their occupied Ruhr area. Exiled in Berlin, Gr√ºber engaged for the Rhine-Ruhr Relief (Rhein-Ruhr-Hilfe) collecting donations for the poor impoverished by the Occupation of the Rhineland and the Ruhr area. After his return in November 1923 he resumed his pastorate in Brackel, changing in 1925 to the D√ºsselthaler Anstalten, a diaconal youth welfare charity of the Inner Mission. Between 1926 and 1933 Gr√ºber was head of the diaconal charity Stephanus-Stiftung Waldhof, a youth education institute (Jugendbildungsanstalt) in Templin. In 1927 Gr√ºber parallelly built up an ecclesiastical volunteer labour service for unemployed persons in the Uckermark. =During the Nazi reign= In June 1933 he resigned from collaborating in the labour service after the Nazi government had merged the various volunteer labour services into the obligatory Reichsarbeitsdienst. Thus provoking Nazi suspicion, Gr√ºber was fired as head of Waldhof youth service in August the same year. Already then Gr√ºber joined the Nazi-opposing Emergency Covenant of Pastors ().Heinrich Gr√ºber.

No ISBN On 2 February 1934 the presbytery (Domkirchenkollegium) of the Berlin Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church appointed the Reformed Gr√ºber as the new pastor of the Kaulsdorf congregation, since this church held the ius patronatus, giving its presbytery the advowson for the Jesus Church in Kaulsdorf.\\"Deed of appointment of Heinrich Gr√ºber\\", issued by the Domkirchenkollegium on 7 February 1934, published in: Heinrich Gr√ºber.

No ISBN The German Christian- dominated Kaulsdorf presbytery strictly rejected Gr√ºber for being an opponent of their Faith Movement. But the March of Brandenburg ecclesiastical provincial consistory (the competent bureaucracy within the old-Prussian Church) insisted on his appointment as decided by the presbytery of the Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church.Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich: 3 vols., Klaus Scholder and Gerhard Besier, Frankfurt am Main et al.: Propyl√§en et al., 1977‚Äì, vol. 3: Gerhard Besier 'Spaltungen und Abwehrk√§mpfe 1934‚Äì1937' (2001), footnote 378 on p. 1152. . The office as old-Prussian pastor included the function as executive-in-chief of the Kaulsdorf presbytery. Thus conflicts were unavoidable. The German Christian presbyters of Kaulsdorf steadily denounced Gr√ºber within the ecclesiastical bureaucracy for criticising Ludwig M√ºller, the then old-Prussian regional bishop (), and the Nazi party local group leader denounced him at the Gestapo, for criticising the Nazi sterilisation laws (see Nazi Eugenics) and for mercy and sympathy with the Jews.Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich: 3 vols., Klaus Scholder and Gerhard Besier, Frankfurt am Main et al.: Propyl√§en et al., 1977‚Äì2001, vol. 3: Gerhard Besier 'Spaltungen und Abwehrk√§mpfe 1934‚Äì1937' (2001), p. 865 and footnote 379 on p. 1152. . Once in office, Gr√ºber built up a Confessing Church congregation at Jesus Church, convening the few congregants opposing the Nazi interference and adulteration of Protestantism, previously unable to organise as a group in Kaulsdorf. As the officially appointed pastor Gr√ºber held the regular services in Jesus Church, preaching against the Cult of personality for Hitler, the severing armament of Germany and anti-Semitism.Dieter Winkler, \\"Heinrich Gr√ºber und die Kaulsdorfer\\", in: Heinrich Gr√ºber und die Folgen: Beitr√§ge des Symposiums am 25.

No ISBN However, other events, such as collections of money for purposes of the Confessing Church, meetings of its adherents or elections of their brethren council, paralleling the German Christian-dominated presbytery, were forbidden to take place as events open for the public, but only card-carrying members of the opposing Confessing Church were allowed. Gr√ºber carried the ‚Äì due to their colour so-called ‚Äì Red Card No. 4, issued on 22 December 1934 by the Kaulsdorf Confessing congregation.Cf. \\"Red Card of Heinrich Gr√ºber\\", published in Heinrich Gr√ºber.

No ISBN The information about Gr√ºber's appointment spread among the adherents of the Confessing Church in neighbouring congregations comprising the competent deanery Berlin Land I, such as , , Blumberg, Fredersdorf bei Berlin, , , Tabor Church (Hohensch√∂nhausen), , , , , , Neuenhagen bei Berlin, Petershagen bei Berlin, or mostly without a local pastor supporting them. They started to travel for Sunday services to Jesus Church.Gundula Tietsch, \\"Berlin-Friedrichsfelde\\", in: Kirchenkampf in Berlin 1932‚Äì1945: 42 Stadtgeschichten, Olaf K√ºhl-Freudenstein, Peter Noss, and Claus Wagener (eds.), Berlin: Institut Kirche und Judentum, 1999, (=Studien zu Kirche und Judentum; vol. 18), pp. 340‚Äì352, here p. 342. . Gr√ºber encouraged them to establish Confessing congregations of their own and attended e.g. the formal foundation of Friedrichsfelde Confessing congregation on 1 February 1935.Gundula Tietsch, \\"Berlin-Friedrichsfelde\\", in: Kirchenkampf in Berlin 1932‚Äì1945: 42 Stadtgeschichten, Olaf K√ºhl-Freudenstein, Peter Noss, and Claus Wagener (eds.), Berlin: Institut Kirche und Judentum, 1999, (=Studien zu Kirche und Judentum; vol. 18), pp. 340‚Äì352, here p. 341. . Gr√ºber presided over the Confessing synod of the deanery Berlin Land I, which constituted with Confessing synodals from the pertaining congregations on 3 March 1935 and paralleled the official deanery synod dominated by German Christians.Gundula Tietsch, \\"Berlin-Friedrichsfelde\\", in: Kirchenkampf in Berlin 1932‚Äì1945: 42 Stadtgeschichten, Olaf K√ºhl-Freudenstein, Peter Noss, and Claus Wagener (eds.), Berlin: Institut Kirche und Judentum, 1999, (=Studien zu Kirche und Judentum; vol. 18), pp. 340‚Äì352, here p. 345. . The Confessing congregants in Kaulsdorf's congregation became a great support for Gr√ºber. He also provided for Confessing pastors, who would act in his place once he could not hold the service himself. In August 1935 his colleague Pastor Neumann from K√∂penick preached instead of him, criticising the anti-Semitic policy of the German government, which earned him a denunciation by the Kaulsdorf presbytery. On the occasion of the Remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936 Adolf Hitler unconstitutionally and arbitrarily decreed a re√´lection of the Nazi puppet Reichstag for 29 March, which was Palm Sunday the traditional day Protestant congregations would celebrate the confirmations of the confirmands, who had grown to ecclesiastical adulthood. The compromising , leading the Protestant regional church bodies in Germany (1935‚Äì1937), regarded this an unfriendly act against Protestantism, but nevertheless obeyed and tried to delay the confirmations, asking a furlough for confirmands from the compulsory agricultural season labour of the Deutsche Arbeitsfront (DAF), starting right next Monday. The DAF refused. The second preliminary church executive () of the Confessing German Evangelical Church, paralleling the official bodies, was of the opinion that the confirmations were not to be delayed. Since fathers, being state officials and/or card-carrying Nazi partisans, were ordered to organise and implement the poll as election judges and with relatives travelling all around Germany to participate in their relatives' or godchildren's confirmations, the Nazis feared a low turnout in the election. This made the confirmations on the traditional date a political issue. Thus only few pastors did not compromise in the end, but Gr√ºber was one of the few (one out of 13 in Berlin, e.g.), who held the confirmation services as usual, even though the Nazi government had announced this would not be without consequences.Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich: 3 vols., Klaus Scholder and Gerhard Besier, Frankfurt am Main et al.: Propyl√§en et al., 1977‚Äì, vol. 3: Gerhard Besier 'Spaltungen und Abwehrk√§mpfe 1934‚Äì1937' (2001), p. 438 and footnote 58 on p. 1035. .

No ISBN The mainstream Nazi anti-Semitism considered the Jewry being a group of people bound by close, so-called blood (genetic) ties, to form a unit, which one could not join or secede from. The influence of Jews was declared to have detrimental impact on Germany, to rectify their discriminations and persecutions. To be spared from that, one had to prove one's affiliation with the group of the so-called Aryan race. Paradoxical was, that never genetic tests or outward allegedly racial features in one's physiognomy determined one's affiliation, although the Nazis palavered a lot about physiognomy, but only the records of religious affiliations of one's grandparents decided. However, while the grandparents were earlier still able to choose their religion, their grandchildren in the Nazi era were compulsorily categorised as Jews, if three or four grandparents were enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation. This Nazi categorisation as Jews of course included mostly Jews of Jewish descent, but also many Gentiles of Jewish descent, such as Catholics, irreligionists, and Protestants, who happened to have had grandparents belonging ‚Äì according to the records ‚Äì to a Jewish congregation. While Jewish congregations in Germany tried ‚Äì little as they were allowed ‚Äì to help their persecuted members, the Protestant church bodies ignored their parishioners who were classified as Jews (according to the Nuremberg Laws), and the somewhat less persecuted Mischlinge of partially Jewish descent. On 31 January 1936 the International Church Relief Commission for German Refugees constituted in London, but its actually envisaged German counterpart never materialised.Hartmut Ludwig, \\"Das ‚Ä∫B√ºro Pfarrer Gr√ºber‚Äπ 1938‚Äì1940\\", in: ‚Ä∫B√ºro Pfarrer Gr√ºber‚Äπ Evangelische Hilfsstelle f√ºr ehemals Rasseverfolgte.

Soon over 30 people worked in the Gr√ºber Bureau, working closely with other organisations in Germany and abroad. Since emigration opportunities for Jews were severely limited, even free nations forming traditional immigration destinations had shut their gates, pastoral care was a priority. The bureau also provided illegal aid to persecuted people, including false passports and medicine and food for concentration camp inmates. Gr√ºber's brother-in-law, Ernst Hellmut Vits, was head of the rayon manufacturer Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken and gave financial support to Gr√ºber for the Bureau. In the night of November 9 to 10, 1938 the Nazi government organised the November Pogrom, often euphemised as Kristallnacht. The well-organised Nazi squads killed several hundreds, 1,200 Jewish Berliners were deported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.Claus Wagener, \\"Nationalsozialistische Kirchenpolitik und protestantische Kirchen nach 1933\\", in: Kirchenkampf in Berlin 1932‚Äì1945: 42 Stadtgeschichten, Olaf K√ºhl-Freudenstein, Peter Noss, and Claus Wagener (eds.), Berlin: Institut Kirche und Judentum, 1999, (=Studien zu Kirche und Judentum; vol. 18), pp. 76‚Äì96, here p. 87. .

Gr√ºber was allowed to travel several times to the Netherlands and Great Britain in order to persuade the authorities there to grant visa for the persecuted from Germany.Heinrich Gr√ºber.

On 13 February 1940 the same fate hit 1,200 Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent from the Stettin Region, who were deported to Lublin. Gr√ºber learned about it by the Wehrmacht commander of Lublin and than protested at every higher ranking superior up to the then Prussian Minister-President Hermann G√∂ring, who forbade further deportations from Prussia for the time being.Hartmut Ludwig, \\"Das ‚Ä∫B√ºro Pfarrer Gr√ºber‚Äπ 1938‚Äì1940\\", in: ‚Ä∫B√ºro Pfarrer Gr√ºber‚Äπ Evangelische Hilfsstelle f√ºr ehemals Rasseverfolgte.

The deported were not allowed to return. On 22‚Äì23 October, 6,500 Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent from Baden and the Palatinate were deported to Gurs, German-occupied France. Now Gr√ºber got himself a passport, with the help of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's brother-in-law Hans von Dohnanyi from the Abwehr, to visit the deported in the Gurs (concentration camp). But before he left the Gestapo arrested Gr√ºber on 19 December and deported him two days later to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and in September 1941 to Dachau concentration camp, becoming the inmate with the No. 27832. His deputy had to devolve the Bureau. For 18 December 1942 Gr√ºber's wife Margarete, still living in the rectory of the Kaulsdorf congregation, managed to get a visitor's permit to speak him, accompanied by their elder son Hans-Rolf, for 30 minutes in Dachau, arguing that he, being the husband and thus according to the garbled Nazi ideas of family values the decision-taking party in the family, would have to decide about important financial matters, about which he would have to instruct the remaining eldest, though minor, male family member.Heinrich Gr√ºber.

He was eventually released due to international efforts and multiple interventions by Vits to his family in Kaulsdorf on 23 June 1943, after signing not to help the persecuted any more. He could not resume his rescue work. Gr√ºber then resumed his office as pastor of Kaulsdorf and the Confessing Church in the Berlin Land I deanery.

On 22 April 1945 at the invasion of the Red Army into the Kaulsdorf neighbourhood Gr√ºber gathered some undaunted Kaulsdorfers to follow him with white flags marching in direction of the Soviet soldiers in order to avoid further bloodshed.

Otto Dibelius, who had assumed the post-war leadership of the old-Prussian March of Brandenburg ecclesiastical province for the time being, appointed Gr√ºber as one of the Nazi opposing pastors for the new leading bodies to be established. On 18 May 1945 Berlin's provisional city council, newly installed by the Soviet occupational power, had appointed Gr√ºber as advisor for ecclesiastical affairs. This earned him a bilingual Russian-German certificate, issued on 21 May, to spare him from the usual robbery of bikes by Soviet soldiers, so that he could move at all in the city, with all the transportation system having collapsed, and an exemption from the curfew valid for Germans, issued on 9 July.Heinrich Gr√ºber.

This type of instrument is meant to be touched or tapped, not strummed. History The DuoLectar was conceived, built, and played by Dave Bunker in 1955. At the suggestion of Irby Mandrell (father of country singer Barbara Mandrell), Bunker changed the tuning configuration of the lower neck to conform to a standard bass. It was introduced to a live, national TV audience on the Ozark Jubilee, hosted by Eddy Arnold and Red Foley, and then in 1960, Bunker demonstrated his double-necked instrument for the Portland Oregonian newspaper. The DuoLectar was later seen in headline shows at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas from 1964 through 1974. In 1985, Bunker developed a specialized electronic mute for the instrument, later patented, and this new configuration would become known as the Bunker Touch Guitar. DuoLectar displayed at the Museum of Pop Culture, Seattle Until guitarist Jimmie Webster first popularized his Illustrated Touch System in 1952, all guitars had been strummed. But with Webster's single-neck touch-style guitar and then Dave Bunker's headless, double-neck, DuoLectar touch guitar, these new instruments, while appearing similar to traditional strummed guitars, actually employed an innovative tapping technique. Because of its influence on the guitar industry, Seattle's EMP Museum (now called Museum of Pop Culture) displays a DuoLectar guitar and features a video interview with Dave Bunker. Some contemporary artists have gone forward to utilize the tapping method with their own touch- style guitars, including Emmett Chapman, Eddie Van Halen, Stanley Jordan, Steve Vai, Jeff Healey, Markus Reuter, Chuck Churchman, and Sergio Santucci. Despite this, the touch guitar genre is still a small segment of the industry. Manufacturers that produce the specialized instruments include Bunker Guitars, Warr Guitars, and Mobius (Magatar).

Early history The Mission Local began as a hyperlocal project of UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, focusing on San Francisco's Mission District. As some of the mainstream newspapers in San Francisco were shrinking and downsizing, it was believed that local media sites might fill some of the holes in reporting that were being left. The new media site was in fact also a new experiment in hyperlocal journalism. With funding from the Ford Foundation, it was launched in 2008, purposely aimed at covering the underserved neighborhood of the Mission. Berkeley Professor Lydia Chavez was its founder. It is one of the few university projects that has been turned into a fully functioning community news site. Many young journalists have worked and trained at this media news site. And in 2009 it began translating all of its contents also into Spanish. Local community news site The Mission Local covers all of the news from the Mission District, trying to provide context to a story so a reader can get a full understanding of an issue or situation. And it has covered many stories on how gentrification is affecting the Latino community in the Mission, And it has even made attempts to lower the walls that often divide the Latino and tech community. It writes stories that are in-depth, multi-faceted, and often issue-oriented. And it has done investigative pieces, one that led to a change in citywide restaurant policy. It is grassroots oriented in its daily news writing and covering of feature stories. And the news site has connected itself to social media, having a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and is on Instagram. The news site also updates its news stories, often several times a day. Becoming independent In February 2014, it was announced by Edward Wasserman, the Dean of Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, that U.C. Berkeley would be disconnecting itself from Mission Local, seeing it now more as a business and \\"...something other than journalism education.\\" Mission Local re-launched itself as a for-profit and independent local media site in the summer of 2014 under the executive editorship of Lydia Chavez. The online news site continues to experiment in trying to find a workable and sustainable model that can be financially sound while also producing quality local journalism. San Francisco Mission fire On January 28, 2015, the 108-year-old building where Mission Local was located at 2588 Mission Street caught fire, causing the loss of one life, leaving 58 homeless, and leaving the building destroyed by flames. Their offices on the second floor sustained a lot of damages, leaving almost nothing salvageable. Yet despite losing its offices to the flames, Mission Local continued to cover the fire extensively. Coverage and semiannual distribution of newspaper The online media site focuses on San Francisco's Mission District, covering a neighborhood with around 60,000 people in it. Their online media site receives about 100,000 unique visitors a month. And twice a year the site distributes 10,000 free, printed editions of the Mission Local as a newspaper. Awards In June 2009, Mission Local won a Webby Award for being the best student news site in the country. In May 2010, Mission Local won first place for Region from the Society of Professional Journalists on How Clean Are San Francisco Restaurants?

He retired as an Emeritus Professor of the University of Vermont.  Career  Dividing his time between research, patient care and teaching, he developed a method which reorganized the structure of the medical record from being divided into the different sources for patient records (x-rays, prescriptions, physician notes) to one structured around a well-defined list of a patient's medical problems. He first published about the problem-oriented medical record in 1964, but a 1968 article published by the New England Journal of Medicine introduced the concept to a broader audience. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he gave lectures at medical schools around the country,\\"Larry Weed's 1971 Grand Rounds at Emory University\\" (video).

According to some critics he was one of the twentieth century's best actors. Life =Early years= Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza y Aguado was born in Jumilla,Some contemporary historians record that he might have been born not in Jumilla but in Caravaco, a short distance to the west. not far from Murcia in the southeast of Spain. He was of aristocratic provenance. He had as titles 7th Marquis de San Mam√©s, 6th Marquis de Fontanar, Count of Balazote, Count of Lalaing and was a Grandee of Spain. His father was Mariano D√≠az de Mendoza y Uribe, 5th Marquis de Fontanar, Grande de Espa√±a and his mother Concepci√≥n Aguado y Flores. Little is known of his early years: during his adolescence he was a member of the society set in Murcia, known to friends as Fernando Fontanar, a reference to one of the several aristocratic titles he would later inherit from his father. As a young man he engaged in the pursuits appropriate to his wealth and status, involving hunting, partying and gambling. =Madrid= In 1880 he relocated to Madrid where he was able to network with other members of Spain's aristocrat elite. Events took an unexpected turn after 1885 when Antonia Dom√≠nguez y Borrell, the newly widowed Duchess of La Torre, decided to build a theatre to provide a creative distraction for the aristocratic set. The theatre would be named after her daughter, Ventura. It was constructed in a palatial property that the duchess owned in Madrid's Calle Villanueva (street). The theatre opened on 30 January 1887 and quickly became a social, cultural and political focus for Madrid society. The play presented was \\"El loco de la Guardilla\\" by Narciso Serra, with music by Manuel Fern√°ndez Caballero. The lead role of Cervantes was taken by a young actor called Fernando Diaz de Mendoza, who received for his performance the first of many standing ovations. During the 1887 season Diaz de Mendoza achieved popular stardom and enthusiastic plaudits from influential critics such as the writer Emilia Pardo Baz√°n and the politician Emilio Castelar. At the end of that remarkable season the Ventura Theatre's remarkable first season the star actor and the young widow who owned the theatre announced their marriage. His wife was the widow or daughter of the recently deceased Duke of Torre and the couple were unusually rich. Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza himself was widowed in 1890, shortly after the birth of the couple's first child, Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza Serrano (1889 - 1937). During the next couple of years he managed to spend his formidable fortune, and in 1892, for the first time in his life, he found himself obliged to work for his living. During 1892 he appeared in several Madrid theatres, then joining the theatre company of Wenceslao Bueno with which he toured in the provinces. However, the company was dissolved in 1893 leaving D√≠az de Mendoza without work. That year he was offered a position by Ram√≥n Guerrero with the Spanish Theatre (Teatro Espa√±ol) in Madrid, an institution under the control of the municipality. =Relaunch= The Spanish Theatre was undergoing building work at the time, so D√≠az de Mendoza's debut with the Spanish Theatre company took place in Madrid's Teatro Princesa (as the Teatro Mar√≠a Guerrero was known at that time).Madrid's Teatro Princesa should not be confused with the better remembered Teatro Princesa in Valencia. where towards the end of 1893 he appeared in \\"\\"El desd√©n, con el desd√©n! by Agust√≠n Moreto. In January 1894 he went on to appear in the comedy \\"Mariana\\" by Jos√© Echegaray.

La empresa y los actores de la compa√±√≠a le obsequiaron con una corona de laurel con las hojas de plata y sus amigos y admiradores le llamaron a escena repetidas veces, en medio de nutridos aplausos y prolongados bravos. El cuarto donde se visti√≥ fue literalmente invadido por sus amigos que se disputaban el honor de felicitarle. Esta tarde cuando yo le he dado mi enhorabuena en el Caf√© Suizo me ha dicho que decididamente se dedica al arte dram√°tico ...El Diario de Murcia (1894) In October 1894 he starred opposite Mar√≠a Guerrero in the classic by the priest-dramatist Tirso de Molina. His co-star was the daughter of Ram√≥n Guerrero who had given him his contract with the Spanish Theatre: the stage partnership on which the two of them embarked in 1894 became a more substantial matter in 1896 when they married. Around this time Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza became lead actor, director and impresario of Madrid's Spanish Theatre. In 1896 Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza and his new wife Mar√≠a Guerrero formed their own theatrical company. On 11 April 1897 their time with the Spanish Theatre came to an end, and four days later they embarked from Barcelona for their first tour in South America, with plans to stage 90 productions in Montevideo and Buenos Aires. The contract they had signed with an American production company stipulated that they should receive 65% of takings provided total daily takings were at least 2,000 pesetas. Argentine press reports indicated that the Spanish company arrived preceded by an excellent reputation. Nevertheless, local audiences were reputed to be very demanding and during recent years several European theatre productions had failed in the region. =South American success= The most important tour venue was the Ode√≥n Theatre in Buenos Aires, where there were 16 performances, including ' and ' (Agust√≠n Moreto) along with La ni√±a boba from the classical repertoire and contemporary pieces such as ' (Jos√© Echegaray), Lo positivo and Los Dolores. Audiences were enthusiastic. Positive critical press reports in Argentina were summarised back in Spain by the culturally focused weekly journal which reported the tour as \\"one of the greatest theatrical successes the Argentine capital has ever experienced\\".uno de los √©xitos teatrales m√°s grandes que ha presenciado la capital de la Rep√∫blica Argentina La Ilustraci√≥n Art√≠stica (1897) The Guerrero-D√≠az de Mendoz company met with similar triumph in Montevideo. The first South American tour was a critical success which paved the way for further tours which would provide opportunities to perform in countries including Per√∫, Colombia, Bolivia and Cuba. =European career= During a 1902 tour D√≠az de Mendoza was involved in a sad episode in Cuba, when another major Spanish actor, Antonio Vico y Pintos, on tour at the time in Cuba, died in Nuevitas. D√≠az de Mendoza made arrangements to take the body back to Spain with him, and paid all the necessary costs. Unfortunately the repatriation was blocked at the time and Vico had to be buried in Cuba. Five years later, however, thanks to the persistence of D√≠az de Mendoza, his fellow thespian's remains were exhumed and returned for burial to Madrid in 1907. Success of their tours in Spanish speaking parts of South America persuaded the couple to tour their productions in several European countries. Their Paris premier was a production at the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance of La ni√±a boba on 4 October 1900. Later that year they moved on to give productions to Italy and Belgium and were well received by critics. However, commitments in Spain and South America ruled out any more major European tours in subsequent years, although they gave several performances in Portugal during the early years of the twentieth century. Official recognition came in March 1903 when D√≠az de Mendoza, seen by many critics as the greatest actor of the age, was appointed by Royal Command to a professorship at Madrid's Conservatory of Music and Drama, where he was given the Chair in Declamation. In 1904 the couple moved into a luxurious three storey mansion, designed by Mar√≠a Guerrero, with construction managed by an architect called Pablo Aranda. The cost was reported as one million reales. An unusual aspect of the new home was that it contained in the basement garage three of the first motor cars in Madrid: a Renault, a Charron 75 and an electric Columbia. The running the house involved a team of 14 servants, working under the supervision of a governess called \\"Miss Hughes\\". In 1908 the municipality terminated the Guerrero-D√≠az de Mendoz company's contract for the operation of the Spanish Theatre, complaining that the company's South American tours were making it impossible for them to fulfill their contractual duties in respect of Madrid. In October 1908 D√≠az de Mendoza also found himself required to resign his professorship Conservatory of Music and Drama where, again, the complaint was that he had been insufficiently present. By this time he also had a major new project in Madrid where on 20 March 1908 Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza purchased the Teatro Princesa (subsequently renamed as the Theatre of Mar√≠a GuerreroTeatro Mar√≠a Guerrero). Following various changes the Guerrero-D√≠az de Mendoza company gave their inaugural production at the theatre on 27 November 1909 with an interpretation of Mar√≠a la Brava. The couple also moved out of their palatial home, taking up residence in a building annexed to their newly acquired theatre, with a direct passageway to the theatre stage. They retained ownership of the theatre till Maria's death in 1928, when it was purchased by the state. Since 1978 it has been home to Spain's National Drama Centre. During the 1910s and 1920s the company continued with its successful productions in Spain and in Latin America. Such was their fame, that often venues had to wait for several years before they had the opportunity to welcome a visit from the D√≠az de Mendoza theatre company. In Argentina they founded the National Cervantes Theatre in 1921. D√≠az de Mendoza also became known as one of the best stage directors of his day. In his old age he was placed in charge at the Madrid Royal Conservatory. Personal Fernando Diaz de Mendoza y Serranos three legitimate sons all became actors. He fathered a fourth son with the successful Cuban born actress Catalina B√°rcena. B√°rcena hurriedly married and the boy grew up with his natural father's first name and his step father's surname as Fernando Vargas.

Production The pioneering Parisian filmmaker Georges M√©li√®s had multiple cinematic encounters with the plays of William Shakespeare. The first, his 1901 film The Devil and the Statue, had alluded to Romeo and Juliet by including a balcony scene and Venetian lovers called Rom√©o and Juliette. (An earlier M√©li√®s work, the 1899 film Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb, is sometimes called simply Cl√©opatre, but it is not connected to Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra.) M√©li√®s also dabbled in Shakespeare in his 1905 film The Venetian Looking-Glass, which incorporates the character of Shylock from The Merchant of Venice. However, these earlier films had merely borrowed elements from Shakespearean works; by contrast, M√©li√®s's 1907 version of Hamlet was a true Shakespearean adaptation. M√©li√®s himself played Hamlet. Special effects used in the film included multiple exposures. The film was the first multi- scene cinematic adaptation of any work by Shakespeare. Later in 1907, M√©li√®s made his last Shakespearean film, Shakespeare Writing \\"Julius Caesar\\", in which M√©li√®s played Shakespeare himself. Release and reception Hamlet was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company, and is numbered 980‚Äì987 in its catalogues. It was registered for American copyright at the Library of Congress on 15 October 1907. The film scholar Robert Hamilton Ball, in his study of Shakespearean silent films, highlights the ways in which M√©li√®s adapted the story in order to tell it in truly cinematic language, a historically unprecedented achievement. (Earlier Shakespeare films by others had stuck to purely theatrical techniques, seeking merely to film scenes from the plays as they were performed onstage.) Ball comments: \\"It is easy to brand this ten-minute film an absurd simplification ‚Ä¶ but it was nevertheless a distinct advance over anything which had heretofore been achieved in Shakespeare film.\\" In his book Shakespeare, Cinema, and Society, John Collick compares M√©li√®s's film to the Expressionist theatrical productions of Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig, saying that M√©li√®s's use of \\"multiple exposures and dream-like Expressionist imagery ‚Ä¶ unconsciously recreat[ed] the spirit, if not the intention, of Appia's and Craig's ideas.\\" Collick also highlights that by condensing the play into a brief succession of fragmentary scenes, M√©li√®s was able to concentrate on the theme of madness in an artistically expressive way. All told, an estimated forty-one film adaptations of Hamlet were made during the silent era. Like many of these, M√©li√®s's version is currently presumed lost.

Founded by Baroness Joanna Shields and supported by over 84 countries, 24 technology companies and 20 civil society organisations, WePROTECT's mission is to stop the global crime of online child sexual abuse and exploitation. David Cameron - Speaking at WeProtect Summit 2014 History thumbnail On 22 July 2013, then-Prime Minister David Cameron made a speech regarding the proliferation and accessibility of child abuse images on the Internet and about cracking down on online pornography. The Prime Minister announced that a new UK-US taskforce would be created to lead a global alliance of the biggest Internet companies to tackle indecent images of children online. Joanna Shields, then the Prime Minister's advisor for digital industries, would head up this initiative, working with the UK and US governments, law enforcement agencies and the technology industry to maximise the international efforts. In October 2013, it was announced that Damian Green, HMG Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims would be travelling to the US with Joanna Shields to formalise arrangements for the task force and to meet with the US Attorney General and leading internet companies. On 18 November 2013 the Prime Minister hosted an Internet Safety Summit at No 10 Downing Street with Joanna Shields to discuss what is being done to block child abuse content and protect children from harmful material online. Participants, including leading search engines, internet service providers, the National Crime Agency, Internet Watch Foundation and the NSPCC, discussed how to rid the internet of child sexual abuse and exploitation. After the summit, the Internet safety communiqu√© was issued, setting out the agreed-upon action. On 13 December 2013, Policing Minister Damian Green, US Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman and Joanna Shields launched the first meeting of the US-UK taskforce to Counter Online Child Exploitation‚Äô. Over the next year, as chair of the taskforce, Joanna Shields was responsible for bringing together experts in government, industry, law enforcement and academia from both sides of the Atlantic to combat child sexual exploitation crimes on the Internet and to reduce the volume of indecent images of children online. In April 2014, Home Office Minister Damian Green addressed the NSPCC child safety conference about the government's work to stamp out online sexual exploitation. He revealed that the government was working with major industry players Google and Microsoft on a pilot to make it even tougher for pedophiles to share child abuse images. He also told the conference that Google had launched a programme to embed their engineers in the Internet Watch Foundation. His speech encouraged Internet companies to innovate in order to fight online child sexual exploitation, and he announced that Joanna Shields would be leading an industry solutions event as part of the US-UK taskforce. The event would bring together experts from across the technology sector to come up with innovative solutions to end the sharing of indecent images and the interacting of adults with children for sexual purposes online. thumbnail In May 2014, the industry solutions event (WePROTECT 2014 ) took place at Gray's Inn in London. In attendance were 67 technology specialists and innovators from 48 of the world's leading technology companies. The event was led by the National Crime Agency CEOP and the Home Office, delivered by Brandfuel and facilitated by PA Consulting. The solutions event started with a hackathon with leading internet, technology and cyber intelligence companies working to develop breakthrough technology concepts that could assist in the prevention and investigation of online child abuse and the protection of victims. The event successfully laid the foundation for a new model of collaboration across the industry, harnessing a diverse range of technical skills, knowledge and experience to tackle sharing indecent images and the grooming of children for sexual purposes. The UK Prime Minister hosted the WePROTECT Global Summit in London in December 2014. The summit gathered government leaders, leading technology companies and civil society organisations to galvanise action to end online child sexual exploitation. The Home Secretary opened the summit, speaking about the scale of abuse and what the UK is doing to combat it. The Prime Minister was the keynote speaker on the second day. Alongside a raft of measures and technical innovations to tackle those who use the Internet to view and share indecent images, the Prime Minister announced that the UK would work with UNICEF to develop a new global Child Protection Fund and that the UK would be making a ¬£50 million contribution to the fund over a five-year period. Keith Bristow, Director General of the National Crime Agency, also spoke at the summit. He addressed the need for law enforcement, civil society and the technology industry to work together to minimise risk to children and maximise risk to offenders. Joanna Shields, the Prime Minister's Digital Adviser, spoke about the importance of the technology industry using its talents, skills and capacity for innovation to tackle online child exploitation. She also delivered a report on milestones by industry partners over the course of 2014. Attendees also heard from executives from Microsoft, Google, EY and Visa, who presented their contributions to WePROTECT and pledged to continue developing the concepts that emerged from May's workshop, including blocking the viewing of illegal material at the browser level, internet interaction risk scoring, a victim identification tool and a system for children to report self-generated indecent images. It was also announced that the United Arab Emirates would be hosting another conference in 2015 to ensure that a global response comes to fruition. At the end of the summit, four ambitious statements of action were published; to date these have been signed by over 50 countries, 20 companies and 10 civil society organisations. A follow-up WePROTECT Industry event took place in September 2015. Speaking at the event, the UK Minister for Internet Safety & Security Baroness Joanna Shields delivered a message of continued support for this initiative and the vital importance of the broad global coalition of the willing coming together to share information and collaborate on how best to protect children online. Industry delegates also heard from representatives of the WePROTECT initiative, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, on milestones achieved by each of the companies in preventing sexual abuse images appearing in search results, identifying online grooming and detecting and removing videos of children being abused. On 16‚Äì17 November 2015, the United Arab Emirates hosted the second WePROTECT Global Summit in Abu Dhabi.

Production M√©li√®s himself plays Shakespeare in the film. The film was his last cinematic work derived from the plays of William Shakespeare; earlier in the same year, M√©li√®s had filmed a film adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Release and reception Shakespeare Writing \\"Julius Caesar\\" was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company, and is numbered 995‚Äì999 in its catalogues. It was registered for American copyright at the Library of Congress on 25 October 1907. The film is currently presumed lost. Film scholar Robert Hamilton Ball, in his study of Shakespearean silent films, calls the film \\"a pleasant little scenario\\", but comments that the film's concluding tableau, strongly reminiscent of M√©li√®s's work as a magician, \\"unfortunately shows ‚Ä¶ the need for a transformation, however inappropriate.\\" Film scholar Judith Buchanan emphasises the cosmopolitan political effect of this final scene, which she describes as a \\"sentimental tribute to a universalising poet\\". Buchanan argues that this all- embracing view of Shakespeare puts M√©li√®s's film in sharp contrast with the next known adaptation of the play, Vitagraph Studios's Julius Caesar the following year; Vitagraph's version heavily underlined its Americanness and prioritised \\"individual patriotism\\" above global concerns. In an article on Shakespearean cinema, Anthony Guneratne mentions the film, highlighting that by \\"showing the poet struggling to dramatize difficult material,\\" M√©li√®s created \\"a special-effects-dominated precursor of Shakespeare in Love\\". The historian Deborah Cartmell comments: \\"It's not hard to speculate that M√©li√®s's decision to play the part of the playwright is an implicit assertion that the filmmaker is 'the new Shakespeare,' but, as the film is no longer available, it is impossible to know how far this can be taken.\\" References External links * Category:Films directed by Georges M√©li√®s Category:French films Category:1907 films Category:Lost French films Category:Films based on Julius Caesar (play) Category:French silent short films Category:French black-and- white films Category:Films about William Shakespeare ","title":"Shakespeare Writing &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;"},{"id":"48425675","text":"Elisabeth Blomqvist (1827-1901) was a Finnish educator. She was the principal of the state girl school Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors (Swedish Girl School of Helsinki) between 1864 and 1898. She was a pioneer within women's education in Finland, a leading reformer and the founder of the first seminary of female teachers (1861). Early life and career Elisabeth Blomqvist was the daughter of the professor Alexander Blomqvist (1796-1848) and the governess Christina Charlotta Harring (1799-1850) in Helsinki. In 1850, her mother and her aunt Anette Harring (d. 1852) opened a school in her home Blomqvistska skolan, to support the family, which was taken over by Elisabeth Blomqvist after their deaths. In 1856, she made a study trip to France and Germany, and upon her return in 1858, she reopened the Blomqvistska skolan, now with serious educational ambitions. She employed male teachers, as they had the formal education, and her school was progressive and offered six classes and a number of subjects normally only taught at boys schools. At this point, the first state schools for girls had been established in 1844, but there were nu educated female teachers. In 1861, she started the first seminary for the education of female teachers in Finland. However, the competition from the state school for girls in Helsinki was a great obstacle despite her success. Educator In 1864, she accepted the post of principal at the state girl school Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors which was one of two state schools for females in Finland (the other being Svenska fruntimmersskolan i √Öbo. As the principal of one of only two state schools for females in the country, she was given a key role in the reform of women's education in Finland, and she used her position to speak in favor of progressive reforms in official school meetings and pedagogic assemblies. She opposed the law that only girls from the Swedish speaking upper classes were accepted at the state girl schools, a restriction which was lifted in 1872; she also spoke in favor of illegitimate girls be allowed; and that the Finnish language, which was the language of the poor classes in Finland but unknown by upper and- middle class women, should be taught to educated women in Finland. She introduced school outings, supported the reform program of more classes and more subjects for girls, which replaced the old education that had been focused on making the students ideal wives; Blomqvist lamented the common view that the only profession open to educated women was that of a teacher and that women were expected to marry and be a wife and mother and nothing else, and when the first woman, Maria Tschetschulin, was accepted with dispensation at a Finnish university in 1870, she supported the reform to give women access to university education and more professions, a goal which was discussed for decades before finally introduced. During the 1870s and 1880s, Elisabeth Blomqvist was one of the most active voices and pioneers in favor of women's access to higher education and more professions, and though her activity was much restricted to her school, this made her an important figure in the early Finnish women's movement. Her old school and its seminar was closed in 1869, but she introduced a seminar for women teachers at the state school in 1868.

Pratt described a site for linguistic and cultural encounters, wherein power is negotiated and struggle occurs. Although when introduced this term was in the context of literacy and literary theories, the term has been appropriated to conversations across the humanities and has been used in the context of feminist theory, critical race theory, postcolonial theory and in discussions of teaching and pedagogy. The contact zone is similar to other concepts that address relationality and contiguity such as positionality, standpoint theory, perspectivism, intersectionality, and relationality (24).  Arts of the Contact Zone  In \\"Arts of the Contact Zone,\\" Pratt describes a manuscript from 1613 penned by Andean man named Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala. The manuscript was a letter written to King Phillip III of Spain and was titled The First New Chronicle and Good Government. The manuscript details Spanish conquest in South America. Pratt cites the manuscript as an example of autoethnography. She writes, ‚ÄúGuaman Poma‚Äôs New Chronicle is an instance of what I have proposed to call an authethnographic text, by which I mean a text in which people undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made of them‚Äù (35). The New Chronicle ends with a revisionist account of the Spanish conquest. Pratt uses the manuscript as an example of an oppressed person or group resisting hegemony, and she connects the practice of authoethnography, critique and resistance to the creation of contact zones. = Transculturation = Pratt also shares the example of Poma‚Äôs New Chronicle to give an example of ‚Äútransculturation‚Äù or a term that ethnographers have used ‚Äúto describe the process whereby members of subordinated or marginal groups select and invent from materials transmitted by a dominant metropolitan culture‚Äù (36). Additionally, Pratt gives the origin of the term ‚Äútransculturation,‚Äù writing, ‚ÄúThe term, originally coined by Cuban sociologist Fernando Ortiz in the 1940, aimed to replace concepts of acculturation and assimilation used to characterize culture under conquest‚Äù (36). Pratt confirms ‚ÄúTransculturation, like autoethnography, is a phenomenon of the contact zone‚Äù (36). = Purpose of the Contact Zone = Pratt states that one of the purposes of the contact zone is ‚Äúintended in part to contrast with ideas of community that underlie much of the thinking about language, communication and culture that gets done in the academy‚Äù (37). Pratt takes issue with the notion of communities as ‚Äúimagined entities‚Äù (37) and that this line of thinking creates a type of problematic nationalism.  Other uses  The contact zone has been used outside of its original spatial concept to describe connections between identity groups that are interacting outside of a specific, local, physical space. The notion of the contact zone has been used to facilitate discussions within composition studies on the topics of multiculturalism, multilingualism and critical pedagogy. The contact zone is used by scholars as a trope for visualizing solutions to conflicts. Marilyn Edelstein discussed the contact zone and multiculturalism. In Edelstein‚Äôs article, ‚ÄúMulticulturalisms, Past and Present, and Future‚Äù questions of inclusion verses difference are prominent. In ‚ÄúProfessing Multiculturalism: The Politics of Style in the Contact Zone,‚Äù Min-Zhan Lu discussed multilingualism and the contact zone, where the student text is the site of struggle. Pratt also uses the contact zone to discuss the classroom space. Pratt writes, ‚ÄúAll the students in the class had the experience... of having their cultures discussed and objectified in ways that horrified them; all the students experienced face-to-face the ignorance and incomprehension, and occasionally the hostility of others ... Along with rage, incomprehension, and pain, there were exhilarating moments of wonder and revelation, mutual understanding, and new wisdom‚Äîthe joys of the contact zone\\" (39). Patricia Bizzell went so far as to suggest that English studies be organized around ‚Äúcontact zones‚Äù rather than historical periods. Bizzell proposed, ‚ÄúI am suggesting that we organize English studies not in terms of literary or chronological periods, nor essentialized racial or gender categories, but rather in terms of historically defined contact zones, moments when different groups within the society contend for the power to interpret what is going on‚Äù (167). Bizzell uses the term to refer to moments in space and time, rather than abstract spaces in the mind or in literature. She describes contact zones as ‚Äúcircumscribed in time and space, but with elastic boundaries‚Äù (166).

The black-and-white segment is two minutes in length; its title came from the plaintext of a base64 string written on the DVD. It depicts a person wearing what appears to be a plague doctor costume walking and standing around in a dilapidated abandoned building, with a forest visible through former window openings in the wall behind it. Accompanied by a soundtrack of loud, discordant buzzing noise, the masked figure holds up a hand with an irregularly blinking light. The film did not have any credits or claims to authorship. Messages, many in commonly used ciphers and encryption systems, have been found hidden in the video and its sound spectrogram, as well as images of tortured and mutilated people. Most of the messages have been decoded by participants in an ongoing Reddit thread, and the images sourced to notable murder investigations such as the Boston Strangler. They have been interpreted as implying a threat of bioterrorism against the United States, although it has also been speculated that the video is in reality a prank, a viral marketing stunt for an upcoming film or video game, or a student film. After it first came to light in October, it was found that it had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a similarly threatening message in binary code. The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is not telling the truth about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofi√≥wka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release. Three months after the initial controversy, an individual going by the name of Parker Warner Wright claimed to have created the video. He told The Daily Dot that it was intended as an art project, and released a sequel video, \\"11B-3-1369\\". As a way of proving his identity, he challenged viewers to create an exact duplicate of his plague doctor mask. Synopsis The video begins with shaky footage showing a figure mostly concealed in the shadow between two window- sized openings in a brick wall, through which leaves in trees can be seen blowing in the wind. These images are accompanied by indistinct electronic buzzing and hissing sounds. The figure holds their right hand to the window, signaling with three fingers, then one, and finally two. The figure remains in shadow, with an insert showing it with cloaked arms spread, as the camera moves farther away and slowly circles to the right. After a jump cut, the lighting around the figure improves, revealing that the figure is wearing an outfit that resembles a plague doctor costume, a long dark long-sleeved hooded cloak with its face masked by a long, downward-pointing dark leather beak and goggles. The figure holds up their right hand, palm facing outward at shoulder height, to reveal a blinking light in the center of the palm. Beeping noises appear on the soundtrack in coordination with the blinks. The figure eventually turns to its right to look at the hand. By this time, the leaves outside are still. The figure turns to look at the camera, now steady, again briefly, then back to its hand. After a series of jump cuts in which they turn rapidly back and forth between the two positions, the figure looks directly at the camera and points to it. A quick cut later, the costumed character is looking at the camera again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image. History On October 12, 2015, John-Erik \\"Johny\\" Krahbichler, founding editor of the Swedish tech blog GadgetZZ, posted about a \\"creepy puzzle\\" that had been sent to him via the mail, perhaps in June. An envelope, postmarked in Warsaw and addressed to \\"Johny K.\\", care of the site's post office box in Helsingborg, with no return address, contained \\"a really weird CD\\" (actually a DVD). On it was written an alphanumeric string long enough to require two lines. At first he assumed it was a product key. He assumed it was some software someone had sent him to review. He tested it out in a spare laptop, and instead found the video. \\"I was unsure what to think of it, but I found it very odd\\", he told The Washington Post. He said that he \\"later reexamined it and started noticing the 'codes' and letters hidden all around the video\\". After making a minimal effort to decode it himself, he gave up and posted about it to his blog, complete with images of the disc and envelope. A few days later Gizmodo ran a story on the discovery. Lily Hay Newman of Slate described the experience of watching it for the first time as \\"creepy\\" and \\"unsettling\\", likening it to the experience of watching the cursed videotape from the 2002 film The Ring. =Possible origins= Early investigations soon found that Krahblicher was not the first to make the video public. In May a user account identified as \\"AETBX\\" had posted it to YouTube, the account's only post to the site. There, it had been identified and described in binary code, with a string of 0s and 1s. As other users began commenting on it, AETBX returned to ask why there was suddenly so much interest in his five-month-old posting. Some commenters speculated that he had, in fact, created it himself; he vigorously denied it. The Washington Post contacted him by email. He identified himself only as \\"Daniel from Spain\\" and said he had been sent the video in the mail as well. His version, he said, was also sent to him, via email from a girl he did not know, who told him she found it on a park bench. In an update to his original post, Krahblicher reported that someone found that even earlier than the YouTube posting, it had been posted to the paranormal board on 4chan. Later, in The Daily Dot, he cast doubt on Krahblicher's account, saying \\"Anyone can fake a DVD\\". Two other leads on possible creators proved false. Around the time Krahblicher first posted about the video, the blog of Triton TV, a student film group at the University of California, San Diego, posted a screenshot of the video along with a title and description in binary. Reached for comment, the group said it no longer used that website and it had been hacked a few weeks earlier; The Daily Dot said the image appeared to have been one of many posted by the hacker at random. A man named Parker J. Wright replied to a reporter's query on Twitter by saying he was not the Parker Wright who had posted the video to YouTube on September 30 with the note \\"Are you listening?\\" alt=An empty room in an abandoned building with no finishes, cement structural systems visible, support columns in the middle, empty openings along a left brick wall through which a forest can be seen, and cement blocks and tires piled on the floor While the identity of the video creator remained unknown, the location at which it was filmed has been identified. A Polish Internet user who was following the story went to the former Zofi√≥wka Sanatorium, near Otwock, a short distance south of Warsaw. One of the rooms there had the same fenestration and graffiti seen in the video. The latter were not present in a photo of the room taken in November 2013, suggesting the video was made between then and April 2015. =Parker Warner Wright= In late November, after most of the initial talk and speculation about the video, its creator and purpose had died down, a Twitter account was opened under the name Parker Warner Wright. Its owner claimed to have made the video; Wright was not the only person on the Internet actively claiming the same thing at the time and throughout the last months of 2015 others posted their own videos in attempt to authenticate themselves. At the end of the month, Wright announced that the next video would be released \\"in exactly 1.444 metric hours\\" on his YouTube channel. At the appointed time, a new video, titled 11B-3-1369, in black and white with occasional effects and inserts, was published, with \\"Their lies unlock our dissent\\", underneath in the description. In it, the figure in the plague doctor costume returned, shown outside the sanatorium in the forest at first, and later within. The soundtrack was quieter than that of the first video and included some electronic tinkling noises which were synchronized with the blinker on the figure's hand. Later in the video, the plague-doctor figure is joined by a woman in a white dress with her face covered in bandages. Three weeks later, The Daily Dot published an interview with Wright. He told reporter Mike Wehner that he was a U.S. citizen who lives in Poland, and that the videos were meant as an art project. After finishing the video, in May 2015, he had left three copies, two on discs in a subway and park in Poland, and the last one posted to 4chan. Reporter Mike Wehner concluded thus that the YouTube user AETBX had no involvement in the video's creation. As a way of authenticating himself, Wright challenged visitors to his Facebook page to replicate the plague doctor mask, which he claimed to have designed and built himself. Some commenters on Wright's Facebook page were skeptical of his claims, pointing to differences in the costume between the two videos; Wright explained the differences by saying he wanted, and made, a better cloak for the second video. Krahbichler accepted Wright's claims. \\"It would be too much of a hassle just to play along for this long, and making up stories that fit so well,\\" he wrote shortly after the second video was posted. \\"I believe it is very safe to say that PWW is indeed the creator\\". In an early-December exchange on Facebook, Wright had told him he had chosen him as the recipient since he had \\"won the business card lottery ... you handed me your business card, at some point\\". Krahbichler speculated that Wright had probably attended at least one of the many tech shows where he had had a booth. Interpretations The Reddit users who responded to Krahbichler's post found other coded messages hidden in the video. An encoded inscription on the disc's menu was found to be \\"11B-X-1371\\", which has been treated as the video's title. James Billington of the International Business Times wrote that \\"some reported [that the video's audio] sound[ed] like 'I would love to kill you' being repeated over and over\\". Another user created a spectrogram of the sound and found both text and images concealed within. The former had one in plaintext saying \\"You Are Already Dead\\"; the rest were enciphered. The images depicted women being mutilated and tortured; early fears that the creator of the video might be a serial killer were allayed when later research discovered that one of the stills was from the horror film The Bunny Game, one was from the German film Slasher and another was a picture of a victim of the Boston Strangler. Most messages had a generally threatening tone. A sound spectrogram of the DVD's menu yielded a picture of a skull and more coded messages. The binary title of AETBX's YouTube posting was \\"Muerte\\", Spanish for \\"death\\", and the description similarly resolved to Spanish text‚Äî\\"Te queda 1 a√±o menos\\", rendered in English as \\"you have one less year\\". The triangle-and-square message near the end of the video was found to read \\"Ad oppugnare homines\\" in Pigpen cipher‚ÄîLatin for \\"To attack or target men\\". The plague doctor costume led other readers to see the video's threats as related to bioterror. One message's plaintext read \\"The eagle=infected will spread his disease. We are the antivirus will protect the world body\\"; another read \\"Strike an arrow through the heart of the eagle\\". The year 1371, it was also suggested, was one in which the Black Death was ravaging Europe. Single-frame inserts were found to have Morse code and other texts in common ciphers. The Morse's plaintext was the phrase \\"RED LIPS LIKE TENTH\\". A sequence of 20 pairs of two-digit characters was found to be the latitude and longitude of the White House in Washington; it was later noted that the \\"RED LIPS\\" phrase could be an intended anagram for \\"KILL THE PRESIDENT\\". These were seen as a threat against the United States in general and President Barack Obama in particular. Krahbichler reported that a cipher in the video could be decoded to reveal the message \\"STANDANDFIGHTWITHUSTAKEDOWNTHEBLACKBEASTKILLHISDISEASEORFALLWITHTHEREST\\", and that the \\"BLACKBEAST\\" of the message could be Obama, an African-American. Krahbichler said that he believed that the video contained a political message, but was not a terrorist threat. Shortly after the individual calling himself Parker Warner Wright revealed himself as the creator on Twitter at the end of November, he said to those who had been working to decode the texts \\"you are no closer to understanding the message\\". However, he allowed that it had been his intent that people work together to break the codes: \\"Not one individual could decipher the whole\\". =Possible purposes= A seventeenth- century depiction of a plague doctor. While the video's metamessage was clearly threatening, it remained too vague to draw any definitive conclusions about what the makers' intent might have been. Since it was publicized a few weeks before Halloween, there was speculation that it could be an Internet prank related to the holiday. After initially being disturbed when the threatening messages were decoded, Krahbichler said, \\"I'm starting to think again it's just an elaborate joke\\". However, he did not think it was one aimed at him specifically, since if the sender \\"knew me personally, they would know I don't have the expertise to crack it, at least not the whole thing\\". The other theory to gain support was that it was viral marketing to promote an upcoming movie or video game. A Redditor noted that the film version of Dan Brown's novel Inferno was beginning production at that time for a late 2016 release. In the story, a rich villain makes a video warning of his plans to release a virus in order to reduce population growth. In it he also wears a plague doctor costume, likens himself to death and claims at the same time to be the cure. Moviepilot also reported on speculation that the video was intended to promote the upcoming season of the Syfy series 12 Monkeys, based on the Terry Gilliam film of the same name. Both concern a time traveler from the future who is attempting to prevent the outbreak of a devastating epidemic in the present. Another Redditor had observed that the line \\"You are already dead\\" is used frequently in the show, as is a plague doctor costume. He added that the \\"3-1-2\\" signaled by the figure's fingers at the beginning of the video could refer to the show's upcoming third season. The video's Polish origin further suggested a marketing gimmick, according to one Redditor from that country. \\"[O]ur fledgling [video game] studios don't have large budgets for 'standard' advertisement[s]\\", he wrote. There had been a similarly creepy viral video in Poland a few years ago, he recalled, that parodied a children's show. He did not think the same people were behind 11B-X-1371, however, as their clip's production values had been higher. Ultimately, it seemed unlikely that any media company, particularly the major studios and television network making Inferno and 12 Monkeys, would risk the negative publicity that would come from using the images in the spectrograms and a suggested threat against a U.S. president. Another theory connected the video to popular electronic musician Skrillex. In May, when the video had first been posted to the Internet, he released a song called \\"Red Lips\\". Shortly after Krahbichler's original post, he tweeted \\"#REDLIPS #REDLIPS #REDLIPS\\". It was speculated that it could be viral marketing for his work‚Äîother musicians in that genre have been known to hide images in spectrograms‚Äîor from some CDs of unreleased work that he said had been stolen from his hotel room. But if it was the former possibility, Krahblicher noted, \\"the problem is that the hints towards the works being promoted are fairly weak\\". Parker Warner Wright, whom both Krahblicher and The Daily Dot believed to be the creator of the video, said it and its sequel were the first in a series of art projects. He would not be specific on their themes or message. \\"I see my work as waves on the ocean\\", he told the latter. \\"Some people look for shells in it, some surf, others‚Äîdive\\". He had always intended for them to be a series, regardless of whether they went viral or not. \\"Currently, there is a call for more, and I aim to please\\", he admitted. \\"However, my art would move forward irrespective of external force. I have a call from within, I need to answer\\". Wright uploaded another video to his Facebook page entitled 110A30213 on November 5, 2016, three days prior to the 2016 United States presidential election. It features Wright addressing a crowd while dressed like a military officer or dictator. Krahbichler theorized that the video, which he deemed \\"very political\\", might have a message related to the election. He also felt that the date that Wright posted the video on his Facebook page could be a reference to Guy Fawkes' words \\"Remember, remember, the 5th of November\\".

The game was written by E. Bruce Hollands and Daniel R. McGregor and drew heavily on the iconography of the late cold war era. Gameplay Players choose a coloured token and draw a number of cards representing world opinion, third world countries and invasions, and then progress through the game seeking to control third world countries and manage world opinion by propaganda. Players work to destabilise countries by coup d'etat, military response, military fortification and invasion - each action of which costs world opinion, which is played out in 'diplomacy' utilising the iconography of the United Nations. The game board was a stylised map of the world split into four regions with a path of came spaces running around them, small coloured tokens representing military forces were placed on countries coming under the player's control (similarly to the method used in monopoly with houses and hotels) Up to six players could play with games taking between 90 minutes and two hours on average. Reception David Walle reviewed Super Power in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 82. Walle commented that \\"Super Power is a cleverly produced and conceived game with a great basic idea, but while the mechanics are inventive and playable, the game falls short in the end because it is so shallow and relies so heavily on died rolls, leaving players feeling powerless and unfulfilled.\\" Reviews *Adventurer #1 (April, 1986)https://archive.org/details/AdventurerMagazine04/Adventurer%20Magazine%2001/page/n15/mode/2up * Casus Belli #33 (June 1986) References External links * https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3549/superpower Category:Board games Category:Games Workshop games ","title":"Superpower (board game)"},{"id":"48425802","text":"Vice Admiral Nicholas William Hine, (born 4 February 1966) is a Royal Navy officer.
